The following information should be noted for this release
of Microsoft Windows.  Also consult your Windows User's
Guide and the Addendum enclosed in the package for further
information.


PRINTING WITHOUT THE SPOOLER
It is possible to print from an application without using
the Spooler.  This may be preferable when running in a two
floppy drive configuration as it conserves disk space.
To use this feature change the "Spooler=yes" in the
[windows] section of the WIN.INI file to read "Spooler=no".

Note:  Setting Spooler=no will disable printing from Windows
Terminal


RUNNING BATCH (.BAT) FILES FROM WINDOWS
If you run a standard application from a batch file you
should create a PIF file for the batch file.  The PIF file
should have the same PIF options set as the application.
The Memory Required and Memory Desired options for the
batch PIF file should always be set to 32K. This is
independent of the memory requirements for the application.

Batch files should be run from the MS-DOS Executive.


RUNNING WINDOWS WRITE ON A TWO FLOPPY SYSTEM
Several precautions should be observed when using Windows
Write on a two floppy system.  As described in your manual,
you should have WRITE.EXE on all of your document disks.
In order to print large documents, you may find it necessary
to print without the spooler, as described above.


RUNNING BASIC AND BASICA WITH WINDOWS
As the Addendum indicates, the COM options in the PIF files
for BASIC and BASICA are set.  This prevents conflicts when
running with communications programs.  If you do not have a
COM port installed in your system, you will get a message
indicating that the COM ports are unavailable when you
attempt to run BASIC or BASICA.  To avoid this, edit the
BASIC or BASICA PIF file with the PIF Editor and deselect
the COM options.


DRIVE B ON A SINGLE FLOPPY SYSTEM
On a single floppy drive systems, the virtual drive B option
is disabled.  On these systems, references to drive B will be
interpreted as drive A.


TEMPORARY FILES
Some applications that run under Windows will create temporary
files.  The filename generally begins with a tilde character (~)
and end with the extension .TMP.  You should never delete these
files while running Windows as they may be in use by an application.
If after quitting Windows you find temporary files of this format,
they may be deleted.


PRINTING WITH THE TI850 AND 855 PRINTERS
The TI 850 and 855 mode switch should be set for draft quality text.
The driver for the TI 855 printer supports the default character set.
Font cartridges are not supported.


RUNNING THE DOS CHKDSK UTILITY
Never run CHKDSK with the /f parameter while Windows is running.
Running CHKDSK without the /f parameter may incorrectly indicate
lost clusters since open files are interpreted as being lost.
Generally CHKDSK should be run outside of Windows.
