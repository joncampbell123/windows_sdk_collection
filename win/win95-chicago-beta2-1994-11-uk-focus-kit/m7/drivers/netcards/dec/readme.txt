        DEC Etherworks 3 Installation Directions
                     for Windows '95

**** NOTE: This driver kit will only work on Beta 2 or later. ****

1. From the Control Panel, select Network. The Network windows should appear.

2. From the Network window, click on "Add". You will then be asked to select
   a component type, double click on  "Adapter".

3. A list of network card manufacturers and model numbers should now be shown.
   Insert the driver disk in A: and click on "Have Disk". At the
   install from disk menu, enter A:\ for the location of manufacturers
   information. Click on "OK". A list of DEC network cards should appear.

4. Select the appropriate card for your system. If you are using DE203-AB,
   204-AB, 205-AB, DE203-AA, DE204-AA, or DE205-AA select
   DEC EtherWORKS 3 (ISA) and click on "OK"

5. Once all of the files have been copied, the Network window will reappear.
   Click on the DEC Etherworks 3 card and then click on "Properties". All
   of the settings on the "Resources" sheet should match what the card
   is set for. The card settings may be viewed or changed using the NICSETUP
   program supplied with your card. The different configurations (0,1, and 2)
   represent the different memory modes(2K, 32K, & 64K). Once these settings
   have been completed, change to the "Advanced Options" page. Once again,
   select the memory mode so that it matches your card settings. This can be
   either 2, 32, or 64 (K).

6. When all the setting are complete, click on "OK" on the properties page
   to return to the network window. If everything looks correct here, click
   on "OK" to close the network window.


NOTE: The driver supplied with this kit is currently UNSUPPORTED. However,
      feel free to mail me any problems or concerns and I'll do my best
      to address them. Thanks.
