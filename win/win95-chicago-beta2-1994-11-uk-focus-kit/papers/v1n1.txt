MICROSOFT SELECTS DSP GROUP'S TRUESPEECH FOR Windows 
"CHICAGO"

Enables Quality Speech Compression in Next Generation 
Personal Computers

Redmond, Wash. and SANTA CLARA, CALIF. -- July 14, 1994 -- 
DSP Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:DSPG) and Microsoft Corporation 
(NASDAQ:MSFT) today announced that Microsoft will use DSP 
Group's TrueSpeech(r) speech compression technology in its 
upcoming Windows 'Chicago' release.  Quality speech 
compression is a key to the successful convergence of 
computers and telephony. TrueSpeech enables high quality and 
efficient processing and transmission of speech essential 
for business and consumer applications.

        Quality speech compression is important for any 
personal computer or personal communication device using 
digitally compressed speech.  The importance is apparent in 
applications such as collaborative computing, voice mail, 
PC-based training and development.

        "Incorporating TrueSpeech into Chicago is evidence 
of Microsoft's commitment to using leading edge technologies 
to make Chicago the highest quality multimedia system for 
developers and end-users," said Rogers Weed, Microsoft's 
Windows product manager."

        TrueSpeech speech compression greatly simplifies 
sharing digitally processed speech between computing 
devices.  A single standard for speech compression means 
computer systems can share digitally processed speech. 
Without a single standard, it is like people speaking many 
languages without any common ground.

        Davidi Gilo, chairman of DSP Group, explained, "We 
realized a few years ago that end-users would benefit 
greatly from a digital speech compression technology which 
is a standard.  We are quite pleased with Microsoft's 
acknowledgment of our technology.  It takes us well along 
toward the goal we envisioned."

        TrueSpeech compression is a technology based on 
complex mathematical algorithms which are derived from the 
way airflow from our lungs is shaped by the throat, mouth, 
and tongue when we speak.  This shaping is what our ear 
finally  hears. TrueSpeech is 5 to 15 times more efficient 
and effective than other methods of digital speech 
compression.  For example, a one minute long speech file 
which uses  other PC audio technology would consume as much 
as 960 kilobytes.  With TrueSpeech, the same file would be 
just over 60 kilobytes. This reserves more valuable 
computing capability for additional functions.

	According to Will Strauss, president of Forward 
Concepts (Tempe, Ariz.), a leading market research firm 
specializing in multimedia technology:  "Speech compression 
is a driving force for the converging applications of 
personal computers and telephony. However, having a speech 
compression standard is critical to being able to use speech 
easily and interchangeably.  This move by Microsoft goes a 
long way toward establishing TrueSpeech as the de facto 
standard."

        TrueSpeech evolved from years of work by DSP Group 
on low cost, high quality speech compression for the digital 
answering machine market.  Since DSP Group pioneered and is 
a leading supplier of digital speech chips for answering 
machines, many of today's digital answering machines use 
this same technology for storing and playing back speech.

        "As next generation Windows operating systems and 
TrueSpeech become widespread in the market, the benefit of 
standard speech compression will become a given," commented 
DSP Group's Gilo.  "Microsoft has the opporunity to include 
TrueSpeech in future versions of Windows."

        Today, there are over 50 million personal computers 
using Microsoft Windows and  over 2 million new machines 
shipping with Microsoft Windows each month.

        In addition to today's announcement regarding 
Microsoft operating systems, TrueSpeech is being included in 
product development by a variety of personal computer and 
semiconductor companies including Analog Devices, Compaq, 
Intel, Motorola, Silicon Systems, VLSI Technology, and 
others.

        Founded in 1975, Microsoft is the worldwide leader 
in software for personal computers.  The company offers a 
wide range of products and services for business and 
personal use, each designed with the mission of making it 
easier and more enjoyable for people to take advantage of

digital signal processing and digital speech technologies 
and products for the PC, multimedia, and communications 
markets.  Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, the

Industry Rallies Around OLE

Lotus, WordPerfect, Borland, Micrografx and 150 Other ISVs 
Will Support OLE in Their Applications; 75 Companies in Open 
Market Data Council Adopt OLE-Based Standards; New Windows 
Platforms to Add 32-Bit OLE Capabilities

	REDMOND, Wash. -- July 11, 1994 -- Microsoftr OLE 
technology is gaining momentum as top software vendors 
announce OLE support for their products and corporations 
embrace OLE for enterprisewide applications.  "OLE is an 
important technology for Borland.  We're developing 
significant tools to help customers migrate their existing 
applications to the OLE world," said Paul Gross, vice 
president and general manager, languages, Borland 
International, Inc.  WordPerfect Corporation has also 
announced it will be the first to offer OLE 2.0 
functionality in five suite applications in its 
PerfectOffice suite of products.

	In the securities industry, the Open Market Data 
Council, consisting of more than 75 leading vendors of 
information technology, has developed a set of OLE-based 
standards for supplying and accessing real-time data for 
applications based on the Microsoft Windows(tm) operating 
system.  Called Windows(tm) Open Services Architecture 
Extensions for Real-Time Market Data (WOSA/XRT), the 
standard provides a mechanism for seamless exchange of 
information between market data feeds and applications that 
support OLE.

OLE Delivers Component Software

	"OLE is a cornerstone of our overall systems strategy 
and delivers the benefits of component software to users 
today," said Jim Allchin, vice president of advanced systems 
at Microsoft.  Component software provides a standard means 
of defining what a software component is and how components 
can interact in a synergistic manner -- without the 
developer having to know anything about how the individual 
components work.  Allchin added, "OLE can lower the cost of 
computing by giving users and developers more software 
choices and greater flexibility.  Today's OLE applications 
will run unchanged and work even better with our next 
generation of Windows platforms, as a result of new levels 
of integration between the applications and the system."

New Windows Platforms Offer 32-Bit OLE

	The next release of the Windows NT(tm) operating 
system, code-named "Daytona," will be released this summer 
with the first implementation of 32-bit OLE, including 
support for multithreaded applications.  "Graphics-intensive 
software requires the horsepower that 'Daytona' and 32-bit 
OLE provides," said Tom Steele, president of Intergraph 
Software Solutions.  "Thirty-two-bit OLE will enable us to 
innovate in ways that really differentiate our products in 
the CAD marketplace."

	The beta version of Windows "Chicago" shipped last 
month with the same 32-bit OLE as "Daytona."  "We've been 
using the latest Microsoft Windows 'Chicago' beta, and it is 
proving to be a fantastic enabling platform for our 
professional graphics applications, Micrografx Picture 
Publisher and Micrografx Designer," said Paul Grayson, vice 
president of development for Micrografx, Inc.  "OLE is a key 
enabling technology for our entire suite of graphics 
applications.  Without OLE, features that are crucial to our 
success would not be possible.  One of our applications, ABC 
Toolkit, is going to blow people's minds with its 
implementation of OLE Automation."  Both Windows "Chicago" 
and "Daytona" support 16- and 32-bit OLE application 
interoperability.

More OLE Applications Each Month

	Microsoft released a new version of the OLE 
applications catalog, which lists more than 300 products 
that take advantage of OLE, including word processing, 
spreadsheet, graphics, database, multimedia and decision-
support applications as well as a variety of programming 
tools to make OLE development easy.  CorelDRAW is one of the 
catalog entries.  "In 1992, CorelDRAW3 was one of the first 
applications to fully embrace OLE technology," said Eid Eid, 
director of CorelDRAW engineering at Corel Systems 
Corporation.  "Our early success with OLE encouraged us to 
extend its benefits to all our key graphics applications.  
Corel VENTURA5, scheduled to ship in late July 1994, will be 
the first professional publishing program to support Visual 
Editing.  We feel OLE has given us competitive advantage and 
enhanced features that are important to the success of our 
product."  

	The catalog also contains more than 20 OLE Custom 
Controls add-in products.  OLE Custom Controls is an 
architecture that migrates the popular VBX architecture to 
OLE technology, allowing applications to be built from 
reusable components.

Windows "Chicago" Logo Means OLE Compatibility

	To qualify for the Windows "Chicago"-compatible logo, 
products must be OLE-enabled, which ensures consistency and 
compatibility among applications and the operating system.  
"The benefit to our end users is that when they obtain new 
Windows-based 'Chicago' applications, they will 
automatically know these applications will work together and 
act alike," said Doug Henrich, director of developer 
relations at Microsoft.  "Consistency and compatibility are 
what customers want, and OLE is the means to provide them.  
OLE is here today, being used by ISVs, corporate developers 
and users."

	Founded in 1975, Microsoft (NASDAQ "MSFT") is the 
worldwide leader in software for personal computers.  The 
company offers a wide range of products and services for 
business and personal use, each designed with the mission of 
making it easier and more enjoyable for people to take
