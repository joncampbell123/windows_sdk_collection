                         Windows 32-bit API Profiler



1. Description
        The Windows API profiler will provide details of Win32 API usage
        by your application.  It consists of the following set of files, 
        which must be on your path when profiling an application:
            
            apfcvt.exe
            apf32dmp.exe
            fastimer.dll
            zernel32.dll
            zdvapi32.dll
            zdi32.dll
            zser32.dll
            zrtdll.dll 

2. Using the Profiler

        o  To use the profiler,

           - Convert the application to load the profiling dlls:
               -- To convert the application to load ALL the profiling
                  dlls, type "apfcvt win32 <appname>", where <appname>
                  is the name of the application with the ".exe"
                  extension.
               -- To convert the application to load only a few of
                  the profiling dlls, type "apfcvt <dll list> <appname>"
                  where <dll list> is the list of PROFILING dlls to load
                  without the ".dll" extension and <appname> is as above.

                  for example,

                       apfcvt zernel32 zdi32 excel.exe

                  will convert excel.exe to load zernel32.dll and zdi32.dll.

           - Start Apf32dmp

           - Run the application to be profiled.

           - Apf32dmp may be used to dump data during the profiling run.
             Data will be dumped to <dll>.wap.  The file extension
             may be changed in the dialog box.

           - Data will be dumped to <dll>.end once the application
             has finished and the dump program has stopped.

           - Restore the application to its original state.  To restore
             an application from ALL the profiling dlls, type
             "apfcvt undo <appname>" where appname is the name of
             the application, with the ".exe" extension.

             To restore an application from selected dlls, type
             "apfcvt <dll list> <appname>" where <dll list> is
             the list of the SYSTEM dlls to restore, without the
             ".dll" extension.

             For example, if the application was converted to load
             zernel32.dll and zdi32.dll, but you wish to restore gdi32.dll,
	     type "apfcvt gdi32 <appname>".
