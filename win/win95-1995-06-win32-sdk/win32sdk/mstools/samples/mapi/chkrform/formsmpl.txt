Installation Instructions
=====================================================================

The MAPI SDK automatically installs the Checkers form into the local
form registry.

To launch the form:

1. Programmatically install the form into a folder registry.
2. Select the Compose menu in the folder, and 
   choose New Checkers Game.

Or programmatically launch the form using a custom extension.

For more information about installing and launching forms, see
the documentation for the form interfaces in the MAPI SDK.

To send the Checkers form to another user:

1. Select a recipient in the address book.
2. Drag a checkers piece to make a move.

The form will be sent automatically when the move is complete.


Known Problems
=====================================================================
Some objects might not be released before the form shuts down.

Data for many of the custom properties is not written to the
message, and the data that is written might not actually be 
meaningful.
