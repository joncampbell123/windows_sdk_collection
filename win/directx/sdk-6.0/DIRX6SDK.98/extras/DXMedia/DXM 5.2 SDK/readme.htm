<h3><a name="New Since DirectShow 5.1"><strong>What's New Since DirectShow 5.1</strong></a></h3>
<p>The DirectX Media 5.2b run time has improvements in two specific areas - DVD Playback and WDM Capture support. 

<p>For DVD playback, the run time provides support for PAL DVD discs as well as improved interactive responsiveness. The run time has also been tested with many new DVD titles that were released in the last two months. 

<p>The Overlay Mixer, which is a key rendering component for DVD playback, has been improved in the following areas.
<ul>
<li>New interfaces added on each pin of Overlay Mixer. 
<ul>
<li><B>IOverlay</B> enables upstream filters to do the rendering themselves, leaving only the window management to the Overlay Mixer.
<li><B>IMixerPinConfig2</B> has methods to set and get brightness, contrast, and other color control features, as if setting the color controls on the overlay surface.
<li><B>IVPNotify2</B> has methods to make the video port the sync master of the VGA, and to determine if the video port is the sync master.
</ul>
<li>The <B>IMixerPinConfig</B> methods <B>SetZOrder</B>, <B>GetZOrder</B>, <B>SetBlendingParameter</B>, and <B>GetBlendingParameter</B>, which previously returned E_NOTIMPL, have been enabled now.
<li>Overlay Mixer now tries to create the overlay surface in AGP memory if allocation in video memory fails.
<li>Some important scaling bugs, including one that did not allow shrinking of overlay surfaces on certain video cards (like ATI rage pro), have now been fixed.
<li>Previously, using <B>IBasicVideo</B> to zoom or stretch video did not do the correct thing. That has now been fixed.
</ul>
<p>The video and audio capture infrastructure has been enhanced to add support for more types of WDM streaming class capture hardware running under Microsoft&reg; Windows&reg; 98 or Windows NT&reg; 5.0. If your application is going to work with this new hardware, you should re-read the capture interface descriptions and re-read the code for our sample capture application, Amcap.exe found in the Capture sample directory.
<p>In addition, a new video control interface has been added, <B>IAMVideoControl</B>, that enables you to flip a picture horizontally and/or vertically, to set up a stream so that it can capture from an external trigger, to simulate an external trigger in software, and to list the current frame rate, maximum frame rate, and available frame rates.
<p>A new filter, Smart Tee, has been added to aid preview on capture filters that only have a capture pin and not a preview pin.

<h3><a name="Overview"><strong>Overview</strong></a></h3>

<p>This release of Microsoft&reg; DirectX&reg; Media contains the following:
<ul>
<li>Direct X Media 5.2b components:
     <ul>
<li><a href="#DirectShow">DirectShow</a>&#153; run time and SDK
<li><a href="#DirectAnimation">DirectAnimation</a>&#153; run time and SDK
</ul>

<h4><a name="DirectShow"><B>DirectShow</b></a></h4>
<p>DirectShow enables capture of multimedia streams from devices and playback of multimedia streams from local files or Internet servers. The streams can contain video and audio data compressed in various formats, including MPEG, Apple QuickTime, audio-video interleaved (AVI), and WAV files. Capture can be based on either Video for Windows or Windows Driver Model (WDM). </p>
<p>The DirectShow run time consists of:
<ul>
<li>Amovie.ocx and Amovie.chm &#151; the Microsoft ActiveMovie&#153; Control and its documentation help file
<li>Quartz.dll and Quartz.vxd &#151; the playback dynamic-link library (DLL) and its Microsoft Windows&reg; 95 helper file
<li>Amstream.dll &#151; the multimedia streaming DLL
<li>Devenum.dll &#151; the PNP device enumeration DLL
<!--@ bj: spell out PNP on first ref. -->
<li>Mciqtz32.dll and Mciqtz.drv &#151; the MCI support DLL and its Windows 95 helper file
<li>Vidx16.dll &#151; the 16-bit capture DLL for Windows 95
</ul>
<p>The DirectShow SDK consists of filters, C++ classes, header files, libraries, tools, samples, and documentation. See <a href="#CD Layout">CD Layout</a> for more information.</p>

<h4><a name="DirectAnimation"><B>DirectAnimation</b></a></h4>

<p>DirectAnimation provides unified, comprehensive support for animation, streaming, and integration of diverse media types, such as two-dimensional (2-D) vector graphics, three-dimensional (3-D) graphics, sprites, audio, and video. Because it is a Component Object Model (COM) API with an underlying engine/run time, DirectAnimation functionality can be accessed &#151; in different ways &#151; by a wide variety of programmers and authors: </p>
<ul>
<li>HTML authors can animate their Web pages by using the DirectAnimation controls and setting the control parameters, without any programming. </li>
<li>Scripting authors using Microsoft Visual Basic&reg; Scripting Edition (VBScript) or Microsoft JScript&#153; can integrate animations with Dynamic HTML to animate the properties of their Web pages. </li>
<li>Programmers using Java, Visual Basic, and Microsoft Visual C++&reg; can develop Microsoft ActiveX&#153; controls or full applications that support multimedia and interactivity. </li>
</ul>
<p>The DirectAnimation run time consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Danim.dll &#151; the DirectAnimation DLL</li>
<li>Daxctle.ocx &#151; the DirectAnimation viewer control</li>
<li>Mmefxe.ocx and Mmutilse.dll &#151; the DirectAnimation multimedia Dynamic HTML controls and DLL</li>
<li>Dajava.cab &#151; the DirectAnimation Java classes</li>
<li>Lmrt.dll &#151; the Liquid Motion Pro run time DLL</li>
<li>Proctexe.ocx &#151; filters and transitions for Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.<I>x</I> from Intel&reg; Corporation</li>
</ul>

<p>The DirectAnimation SDK consists of libraries, header files for the C++ samples, JScript, VBScript, Java, Visual Basic, and C++ samples, media files, and documentation. See <a href="#CD Layout">CD Layout</a> for more information.</p>

<h3><a name="Use Docs"><strong>How to Use the Documentation</strong></a></h3>
<p>The DirectX Media SDK documentation is supplied in two ways: as an InfoViewer file and as HTML.
<p>The InfoViewer files, DXMedia.ivt and DXMedia.ivi, are in the subdirectory x86\Dxmsdk\help within the SDK and contain the DirectShow, DirectAnimation, DirectPlay, and Direct3D Retained Mode documentation. The InfoViewer files are installed only if InfoViewer is present on the computer. (InfoViewer ships with the MSDN library, Visual C++, and other Microsoft products.) 

<p>The HTML documentation opening page, Start.htm, is in the \Dxmsdk subdirectory within the SDK. You can only read this file if you have installed Internet Explorer 4.x, which is included on the CD. You can also bypass this opening page and go directly to the start pages of documentation that interests you. These start pages can be viewed in any browser: 
<ul>
<li>The DirectShow documentation start page is \dxmsdk\help\ds\default.htm. 
<li>The DirectAnimation documentation start page is \dxmsdk\help\da\default.htm. 
<li>The DirectPlay documentation start page is \dxmsdk\help\dplay\default.htm. 
<li>The Direct3D Retained Mode documentation start page is \dxmsdk\help\d3drm\default.htm. 
</ul>
