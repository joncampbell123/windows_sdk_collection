<P> 
DirectAnimation supports the use of any image as a texture,
including interactive, time-varying images.  This sample
creates a composite image with movable elements (click and drag the
eyeball, apple, and flag), and with time-varying opacity and
transformations.  
<P>
Note that the eyeball's position is used to control both the opacity of the
apple and the stretching to apply to the flag.
<P>
This slice of Americana is then used as a texture, and any changes to
the original image are reflected immediately in the texture since,
after all, it is the same image being used.
<P>
Soon, DirectAnimation will also support manipulation of the image
from within the texture, without any changes to the DirectAnimation
script that created this model. 
<P> 
Click on the buttons above to change various elements of the
presentation.  You can also use the keyboard controls for 
manipulating the camera to change the view on the cube.
