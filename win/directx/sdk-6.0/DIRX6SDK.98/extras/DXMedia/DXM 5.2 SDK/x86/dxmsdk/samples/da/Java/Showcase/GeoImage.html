<P>This sample textures a picture on both sides of a rectangle into what is called the geoImage. The geoImage preserves the original aspect ratio of the picture. The sample then animates the geoImage in 3-D space, including a page open/close simulation. The sample renders the geoImage on top of the original picture, which is displayed as a bitmap in the image plane.</P>
<P>2-D/3-D coordination is illustrated by flagging, with an <B>audible click</B>, the instance when <B>geoImage lies on the image plane</B>, in which case the textured rectangle and the original image <B>overlap precisely</B>. Furthermore, the projection of geoImage into the image plane is larger than the bitmap when it is closer than the image plane (positive Z) and smaller when further away (negative Z). </P>
<P>The right and left arrow keys advance pages forward and backward, respectively. (Don't forget to obtain focus by clicking the left mouse button on the applet). There is also a timeout event that automatically advances through the sequence of pictures. </P>
