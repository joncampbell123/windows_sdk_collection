<P>This page contains many links to interesting web sites about Seattle.  
A yellow tip box comes up when the mouse is over an object that contains a link.  
Click on the object to jump to that site.  Click on the boy who is fishing, the girl flying a kite, and the cars on the street to see
how they react to you.  

<P>A helicopter or a train will come by periodically.  
Hit the <FONT COLOR=RED>&quot;h&quot;</FONT> and <FONT COLOR=RED>&quot;t&quot;</FONT> keyboard
keys to make them come by when you want to.

<P>This page uses two 3D models, kite and helicopter, and many 2D sprites with color
keys.  bSpline is used to calculate the path of the train, the kite and the helicopter.
Image transformation and audio functions are used heavily to create the
animation and audio effects.
