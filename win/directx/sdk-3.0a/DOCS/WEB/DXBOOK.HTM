	<td>Introducing DirectX 3:  The Microsoft® DirectX™ Software Development Kit (SDK) 
	provides a finely tuned set of application programming interfaces (APIs) that give 
	you the resources you need to design high-performance, real-time applications. The

	DirectX technology. </td>

	interface (API) is the audio component of the DirectX™ 3 Software Development 
	Kit (SDK) that provides low-latency mixing, hardware acceleration, and direct 
	access to the sound device. DirectSound provides this functionality while 
	maintaining compatibility with existing Windows®-based applications and

	<td>About DirectPlay: The Microsoft® DirectPlay™ application programming 
	interface (API) for Windows® is a software interface that simplifies your 
	application's access to communication services. DirectPlay has become a 
	technology family that not only provides a way for applications to communicate 
	with each other that is independent of the underlying transport, protocol, or 
	online service, but also provides this independence for matchmaking (lobby) servers. </td>

	<td>Introduction to Joysticks: The Microsoft® DirectInput™ application 
	programming interface (API) provides fast and consistent access to analog 
	and digital joysticks. The DirectInput API maintains consistency with the 
	joystick APIs of the Microsoft Win32® Software Development Kit (SDK), but has 
	improved responsiveness and reliability by changing the device driver model. 
	DirectInput device drivers use the registry to store settings for standard 
	joysticks, calibration information for previously configured joysticks, and 
	settings for OEM-supplied joysticks. </td>

	<td>Introduction to using DirectInput keyboard and mouse support:  One of the
	most frequently received requests for enhancements to the DirectX SDK has
	been to allow faster access to mouse and keyboard data than Windows currently
	provides.  DirectInput 3 provides fast low-latency access to mouse and
	keyboard data.  This late-breaking info is only available from this
        doc file, it is not in the help files yet!</td>

	<td>About DirectSetup: DirectSetup is a simple application programming 
	interface (API) that provides you with a one-call installation for the DirectX™ 3 \
	components. This is more than a convenience; DirectX 3 is a complex product and its 
	installation is an involved task. You should not attempt a manual installation of 
	DirectX 3.  </td>
