DirectInput 3.0 release notes

What's new in DirectInput 3.0
=============================
-COM interface that supports mouse and keyboard data.  Examples are provided in Flip2D (mouse), Duel (keyboard) and scrawl.  For detailed information on the new interface see DInput3e.doc.  These new interfaces are not described in the DirectX help file.

-Bug fixes to VJOYD.VXD and joy.cpl.  A few key fixes are listed below:

VJOYD polling is no longer interrupted by DMA access.  This should fix the problem of the joystick behaving erratically when audio is being played.

VJOYD now passes the data in the dwReserved2 field of the JOYINFOEX structure to the mini-driver on request.

Devices without buttons can now be calibrated in joy.cpl.

VJOYD.VXD now works correctly with global port drivers.


INITGUID vs. DXGUID.LIB
=======================

You can generate the DirectInput GUIDs yourself by defining INITGUID.  However, if you want to avoid generating all of the DirectInput GUIDs (including the ones you don't use), link to DXGUID.LIB instead of defining INITGUID.


Documentation for for DirectInput 3.0
=====================================
The documentation for the COM interfaces to support mouse and keyboard devices are not in the DirectX help file.  They are documented in the file dinput3e.doc which can be found in the \docs directory.  The joystick APIs, however, are still documented in the DirectX help file.


DirectInput 3.0 for the Windows NT Operating System
===================================================

In the EXTRAS\dinput directory on the CD is a preliminary version of DirectInput 3.0 for the Windows NT Operating System.  See the readme in that directory for more information.

The implementation of DirectInput 3.0 for Windows NT has the following limitations:

* The keyboard can be acquired only in non-exclusive foreground mode.
* The mouse can be acquired only in exclusive foreground mode.
