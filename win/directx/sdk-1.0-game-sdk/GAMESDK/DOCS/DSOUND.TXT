1. DirectSound API Changes since Beta-2
=======================================

- We are now validating that the dwSize member of the DSCAPS, DSBCAPS,
and DSBUFFERDESC structure are set correctly.  We do this so that we
can add functionality to the structures and APIs in future releases.  You
should always set the dwSize member before doing anything with the structure.
     {       
         DSCAPS dscaps;
         dscaps.dwSize = sizeof(DSCAPS);
         ...
     }

- IDirectSound::CreateSoundBuffer was changed for creating primary buffers.
Now, applications must specify DSBUFFERDESC.dwBufferSize=0 and
DSBUFFERDESC.lpwfxFormat=NULL when creating primary buffers.  To find out
the size of the primary buffer created, call IDirectSoundBuffer::GetCaps.
To set the format of the primary buffer, call IDirectSoundBuffer::SetFormat.

- IDirectSoundBuffer::Restore has been implemented.  Be sure to check for
DSERR_BUFFERLOST from the Play and Lock member functions.  You can also
test for lost buffers by calling IDirectSoundBuffer::GetStatus and testing
for the DSBSTATUS_BUFFERLOST flag.

- If an application calls IDirectSoundBuffer::SetFormat on the primary
buffer, DirectSound will set the primary buffer to that format whenever
that application gains the input focus.  That way, all applications are
guaranteed that the primary buffer is in their preferred format whenever
their buffers are audible.  Note that only applications with
DSSCL_PRIORITY cooperative level or higher can call
IDirectSoundBuffer::SetFormat.

- IDirectSoundBuffer::SetVolume and IDirectSoundBuffer::SetPan may be
called on the primary buffer by any application, regardless of cooperative
level.  This will affect the overall volume and pan of the sound hardware
(i.e. for all secondary streams).

- We implemented IDirectSound::DuplicateSoundBuffer.  Note, however, that
if you try to duplicate a hardware secondary buffer and there are no more
mixing channels available, the call will fail.  You should always test
DuplicateSoundBuffer for failure, and if it fails you should try to
create a buffer using CreateSoundBuffer.

- The primary sound device (the one you get when you specify a NULL GUID
in DirectSoundCreate) will create the preferred sound device as specified
in the Multimedia control panel applet.

- We added support for multiple DSSCL_WRITEPRIMARY applications.  Note,
however, that when a write-primary app gains the input focus, all secondary
buffers in that and other applications will be stopped and marked as lost,
and must be Restored before they can be played again.  In addition, when a
write-primary app loses the input focus, its primary buffer is marked as
lost and cannot be restored until that application regains the input focus.

- We dropped support for DSSCL_WRITEPRIMARY applications when running on
emulated drivers (i.e. when no DirectSound driver is available).

- New "C" interface macros were added to help out C programmers.  Check out
the macros in dsound.h, such as IDirectSound_CreateSoundBuffer, etc.

- We added a certified driver bit which is set when DirectSound is running
on Microsoft-tested drivers.  To test for this bit, call
IDirectSound::GetCaps and test the DSCAPS.dwFlags member for the
DSCAPS_CERTIFIED flag.  Note, however, that wave-emulated objects will not
have the DSCAPS_CERTIFIED flag set, but they will have the DSCAPS_EMULDRIVER
flag set.

- We removed the following APIs:  IDirectSound::GetLatency and
IDirectSound::SetLatency.  We did this because they weren't needed -
DirectSound currently gives you the best latency possible (15-20 ms on
supported drivers).

- We also removed IDirectSoundBuffer::WaveBlt.  We did this because it
was not being used by developers, and had not undergone sufficient testing.
Rather than release it with potential problems, we will review and test it
for the next release.

- IDirectSoundBuffer::SetCurrentPosition cannot be called on a primary
buffer.  Most sound cards cannot support this function.

- IDirectSound::Compact remains unimplemented.


2. DirectSound Driver Support
=============================

The final release contains DirectSound versions of all sound drivers
included in the Windows 95 product.  This includes the following:

- Sound Blaster:  8-bit cards, 16-bit cards, and the AWE32.
- ESS: 488, 688, 1488, 1688.
- MediaVision: PAS 16, PAS Studio, PAS Plus, Pro 3D, and Blue Lite Special.
- Aztech: Nova 16, Washington 16, Rocky 2.
- Microsoft: Windows Sound System.

Sound cards which do not have DirectSound drivers can still be accessed
through DirectSound.  If no driver is available, DirectSound will use its
emulation layer to communicate with the device through the standard Wave
driver interface.  This provides full DirectSound functionality, but
increases latency significantly and prevents access to hardware
acceleration.

We have also encountered faults in certain situations on the Roland
Rap 10 and the Gravis UltraSound MAX.
