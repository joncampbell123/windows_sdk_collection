PLEASE NOTE:

- In this release, DirectDraw will only support page flipping at and mode
  setting to 640x480x8, 640x480x16, 320x200x8, 320x240x8 on all systems
  and 640x400x8 and 640x400x16 on most systems.   As well, if you want 
  to use DirectDraw to run in a window, that is supported as well at any
  resolution at 8bpp or 16bpp: you just can't create a page flipping primary 
  surface in a mode larger than 640x480.

- dwSize fields are validated!
  We must enforce size fields so that if we choose to grow the structure 
  in the future, we can still allow old applications to run. Structures 
  that have enforced dwSize fields include:
  
          DDCAPS
          DDBLTFX
          DDOVERLAYFX
          DDPIXELFORMAT
          DDSURFACEDESC
          
  When you are passing one of these structures in to us, you need to set
  the dwSize field to the size of the structure, eg:
  
        DDSURFACEDESC   ddsd;
        ddsd.dwSize = sizeof( DDSURFACEDESC );

 The most common ones are DDBLTFX if you are doing a color fill and  
 DDSURFACEDESC when you create a surface

****************************


- Flip now takes a flags field as its last parameter.  This can be
  either 0 or DDFLIP_WAIT (DDFLIP_WAIT waits until WASSTILLDRAWING is 
  no longer true).
  
- Blt and BltFast take a flag that makes them wait until WASSTILLDRAWING
  is no longer true (DDBLT_WAIT and DDBLTFAST_WAIT)

======================
Exclusive Mode Changes
======================
SetExclusiveModeOwner was changed to SetCooperativeLevel.

change from:

lpdd->lpVtbl->SetExclusiveModeOwner( lpdd, DDSEMO_FULLSCREEN, TRUE );

to:

lpdd->lpVtbl->SetCooperativeLevel( lpdd, hWnd, DDSCL_EXCLUSIVE | DDSCL_FULLSCREEN );

SetCooperativeLevel is required to run a DirectDraw application.
Just follow your DirectDrawCreate call with a SetCooperativeLevel call.

SetCooperativeLevel mode requires a valid HWND.  DirectDraw uses this HWND to
handle various messages to control changing the mode when the user switches
to and from your application.   

DirectDraw reserves the GWL_USERDATA field in the HWND for its use; if you 
need per window data, you should add data to the class. 

If you do a SetCoopertativeLevel with DDSCL_EXCLUSIVE, then your HWND must
be a topmost window, created with CreateWindowEx:

    hwnd = CreateWindowEx( WS_EX_TOPMOST, ... )

In this release, you must declare that you are DDSCL_FULLSCREEN when 
you use DDSCL_EXCLUSIVE.

===============================
Changes to All Create Functions
===============================
DirectDrawCreate
CreateSurface
CreatePalette

These have xHave been modified to take a pointer to a controlling IUnknown 
as the last parameter.   This allows our objects to be aggregatable by other 
COM objects; you will normally set it to NULL.    Unless you are a real 
OLE 2/COM-head, this will not impact your life one iota.

=====================
CreateSurface Changes
=====================
CreateSurface has also been modified to be consistent with the rest of the
create functions.   Instead of the surface object being passed in the
DDSURFACEDESC structure, it is now a parameter... so code (using C++ notation)
goes from:

    ddrval = lpDD->CreateSurface( &ddsd );
    if( ddrval != DD_OK )
    {
        return initFail(hwnd);
    }

    lpDDSPrimary = ddsd.lpDDSurface;
    
To:
    ddrval = lpDD->CreateSurface( &ddsd, &lpDDSPrimary, NULL );
    if( ddrval != DD_OK )
    {
        return initFail(hwnd);
    }
    
In C Notation:

From:
    ddrval = lpDD->lpVtbl->CreateSurface( lpDD, &ddsd );
    if( ddrval != DD_OK )
    {
        return initFail(hwnd);
    }

    lpDDSPrimary = ddsd.lpDDSurface;
    
To:
    ddrval = lpDD->lpVtbl->CreateSurface( lpDD, &ddsd, &lpDDSPrimary, NULL );
    if( ddrval != DD_OK )
    {
        return initFail(hwnd);
    }

========
Palettes
========

Palettes are restricted to entries 1-254 (0 is black, 255 is white).
You can override this by specifiying DDPCAPS_ALLOW256 when you create the 
palette, but be warned: palette index 0 is the overscan color on some 
cards, and so setting it will cause the overscan area of the display to
change color.
  
===========
Lock/Unlock
===========

You should be careful  with how you use Lock/Unlock calls.
Please be aware that the ONLY time the memory pointer is guaranteed to
be valid is in between the Lock/Unlock calls.   If you stash the pointer
and use it outside the Lock call, you can hang certain display cards.
Also note that mode sets will fail and other problems will occur if you
have outstanding locks.   You cannot just lock a surface and leave 
it locked.   You should just lock the surface, party on it, and unlock it.
  
People have wondered why when using VC++ things hang over a Lock call:
The reason for this is that we had to hold the Win16 lock in between Lock
and Unlock.   The Win16 lock is the critical section that protects 16-bit
GDI and USER.   So if this is held, VC++ will stop responding.   There
are a number of reasons we had to do this, but the reasons don't make your
life any easier.   There are two solutions you can use:  
  1) use the kernel debugger or SoftIce for Win95 from NuMega.   This is the 
     best solution.   
  2) create your surfaces using the caps bit DDSCAPS_SYSTEMMEMORY.   This
     is sub-optimal since you won't get any hardware acceleration.  Also
     the front buffer will always be in video memory and so will require the
     win16 lock.    IF YOU CREATE YOUR PRIMARY SURFACE USING THE SYSTEM
     MEMORY FLAG YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PAGE FLIP.
  

======
Macros
======

DirectDraw defines some standard macros for use with C programs.   Instead
of writing code like this:

lpDD->lpVtbl->GetCaps( lpDD, &ddcaps, NULL );

you can write:

IDirectDraw_GetCaps( lpDD, &ddcaps, NULL );

Every method is preceeded with the interface name and an underscore; ie:

IDirectDraw_XXXX
IDirectDrawSurface_XXXXX
IDirectDrawPalette_XXXXX
IDirectDrawClipper_XXXXX

=====================
Bank Switched Devices
=====================

We've added a caps bit for testing for bank switched devices: 
DDCAPS_BANKSWITCHED.   See foxbear for an example of how this is used.

A bank switched  device will be very slow in general when copying from 
VRAM to VRAM over the bus.  Windows 95 uses a VxD called VFLATD to make 
banked devices look like flat frame buffer devices.   It does this by 
mapping in a 64k bank using page faults.   Whenever you touch a new 64k bank, 
a page fault occurs and that 64k bank is mapped in.   So if you stay in the 
same 64k bank, you will not incur any overhead.    If you don't (say you
compose an image into VRAM and then try to copy it using memcpy to another
section of VRAM), then you will incur 2 page faults/bank switches per pixel.

A place this can be really bad is if you rely on our software stretching and
try to stretch from a VRAM surface to the front buffer or back buffer.  
Stretching 320x240 to 640x480 this way would cause on the order of 150,000
page faults/bank switches per frame.   Needless to say, this non-optimal.

If you are going to be stretching, or doing any other heavy VRAM-VRAM copies
without using the bltter, then you need to make sure that you pay attention
to the DDCAPS_BANKSWITCHED flag, and create a system memory surface. For 
example:

    extern LPDIRECTDRAW lpDD;
    DDCAPS              ddcaps;
    BOOL                is_banked;
    DDSURFACEDESC       ddsd;
    HRESULT             ddrval;
    LPDIRECTDRAWSURFACE psurf;

    is_banked = FALSE;
    if( IDirectDraw_GetCaps( lpDD, &ddcaps, NULL ) == DD_OK )
    {
        if( ddcaps.dwCaps & DDCAPS_BANKSWITCHED )
        {
            is_banked = TRUE;
        }
    }
    
    ddsd.dwSize = sizeof( ddsd );
    ddsd.dwFlags = DDSD_CAPS | DDSD_HEIGHT | DDSD_WIDTH;
    
    ddsd.ddsCaps.dwCaps = DDSCAPS_OFFSCREENPLAIN;
    if( is_banked )
    {
        // force this surface to be in system memory
        ddsd.ddsCaps.dwCaps |= DDSCAPS_SYSTEMMEMORY
    }
    ddsd.dwWidth = 320;
    ddsd.dwHeight = 240;

    ddrval = IDirectDraw_CreateSurface( lpDD, &ddsd, &psurf, NULL );
    

=====================
Multiple Applications
=====================
DirectDraw will support multiple applications.  You can switch away from
your DirectDraw application using the standard keys (alt-tab, ctrl-esc, 
alt-esc).   When you do this, your application will minimize itself on the
tray.   You can then select the game from the tray and it will restart.

Please pay careful attention to the DDERR_SURFACELOST message.   You can
receive this error whenever you flip, blt or lock a surface.   What this is
telling you is that a mode change has happened since the last time you
accessed the surface.   If a mode change happens, the video memory storage
is "lost".   You should call the Restore method on the surface to recover its
video memory, and you can reload the surface with its original data. 
NOTE: surfaces *explicitly* created in system memory using 
DDSCAPS_SYSTEMMEMORY will not be lost during a mode set.

Also remember to pay attention to the WM_ACTIVATEAPP message.  This message
tells you if your application is being activated or deactivated.  When
your application is deactivated, you should not process your game loop.  Here
is a code snipit from the Fox & Bear sample:

from message loop:

    case WM_ACTIVATEAPP:
        bIsActive = (BOOL) wParam;
        break;
        
from main game loop:

    while( 1 )
    {
        if( !bIsActive || PeekMessage( &msg, NULL, 0, 0, PM_NOREMOVE ) )
        {
            if( !GetMessage( &msg, NULL, 0, 0 ) )
            {
                return msg.wParam;
            }
            TranslateMessage(&msg); 
            DispatchMessage(&msg);
        }
        else
        {
            ProcessFox(lastInput);
        }
    }
    
Note that the game blocks on a GetMessageCall whenever the game has been
deactivated.


=============
Low Res Modes
=============
We allow the following ModeX modes

320x200
320x240

In these modes you can only update the back buffer, you can't write the 
primary surface.   You must update your back buffer and then page flip
for it to become visible.

=====================
Set Cooperative Level
=====================

SetCooperativeLevel is required to run a DirectDraw application.
Just follow your DirectDrawCreate call with a SetCooperativeLevel call.

SetCooperativeLevel mode requires a valid HWND.  DirectDraw uses this HWND to
handle various messages to control changing the mode when the user switches
to and from your application.   

DirectDraw reserves the GWL_USERDATA field in the HWND for its use; if you 
need per window data, you should add data to the class. 

If you do a SetCoopertativeLevel with DDSCL_EXCLUSIVE, then your HWND must
be a topmost window, created with CreateWindowEx:

    hwnd = CreateWindowEx( WS_EX_TOPMOST, ... )

In this release, you must declare that you are DDSCL_FULLSCREEN when 
you use DDSCL_EXCLUSIVE.

    
==================
Known Bugs/Gotchas
==================
1) BltBatch is not supported

2) Emulation-only (non-DirectDraw drivers) isn't supported in < 8 or > 16bpp.
