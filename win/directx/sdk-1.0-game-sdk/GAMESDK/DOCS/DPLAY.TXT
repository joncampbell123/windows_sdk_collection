An application should use DirectPlayEnumerate() to determine the
service providers available and create a list of these.  This list should
be presented to your user.   Once the user selects a provider, the application
should open based on the GUID (returned in the callback) using
DirectPlayCreate().  

DirectPlay provides 3 services in 2 dlls. Serial Modem, TCP/IP, IPX. 

Once connected, the user should select whether they wish to Create a
game or connect to one.  For the creation case, call Open() with the game 
parameters set.  For connection, call EnumerateSessions(), have the user 
pick a game, and then open that game.

You should always do a DestroyPlayer() on any locally created players before
you try and exit.

You should always Close() before exiting.

Close() will not succeed unless you have destroyed all local players.
In addition, if you are the game creator all players must be destroyed.

Latency is not a guaranteed value by any means.  If latency is truely
important to you, you should check appliation to application latency 
by measuring it yourself.

It is important to keep packet sizes as small as possible.  

It is important to limit the amount of messages that can be generated.  
Immortal Klowns, for example, issues a message for every keystroke.  Someone 
pounding on the keyboard will cause IKlowns to fail.  It is better if 
you sample keyboard input at a particular rate, or otherwise limit the input.

Always remember that DirectPlay implements unreliable communications.  
You can't count on a message getting to its destination.

You tell a system message from others because it comes from player 0.

If you get a DPSYS_SESSIONLOST system message you need to delete the 
players, close the session, release the DirectPlay object, and recreate 
the DirectPlay object and your local player(s).
