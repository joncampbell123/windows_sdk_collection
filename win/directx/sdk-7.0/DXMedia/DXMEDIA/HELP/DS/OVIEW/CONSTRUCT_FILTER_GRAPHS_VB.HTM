<H2><A NAME="vbbld_1" IDX_CONCEPT="noindex; filter graphs in Visual Basic; Visual Basic filter graphs">About Filter Graphs</A></H2>
<P>The <I>Filter Graph Editor</I> provided with the Microsoft DirectShow&#153; Software Development Kit (SDK) is a graphical tool that creates and manages filter graphs. There are three types of filters: <A CLASS="Glossary" HREF="javascript:Glossary(sRelPath + 'gloss/gloss_S.htm#source_filter')">source filters</A>, <A CLASS="Glossary" HREF="javascript:Glossary(sRelPath + 'gloss/gloss_T.htm#transform_filter')">transform filters</A>, and <A CLASS="Glossary" HREF="javascript:Glossary(sRelPath + 'gloss/gloss_R.htm#renderer')">renderer</A> filters. The Filter Graph Editor is a graphic user interface you use to construct filter graphs by inserting filters and creating connections between them. For example, you can render the filter graph for a specific multimedia source file, such as Dolphin.mov, and see each of the connections in the graph, as in the following example. 

<P><IMG SRC="../art/vbbld01.gif" WIDTH="636" HEIGHT="308" ALT="Filter Graph Editor example"> 
 
<P>The same filter graph objects, filters and pins, can be managed from a Visual Basic-based application that uses Quartz.dll. For simplicity, the 
Visual Basic-based sample application, Builder, uses list boxes rather than graphical elements to 
show the parts of the filter graph, and displays information for only one 
filter and only one <A CLASS="Glossary" HREF="javascript:Glossary(sRelPath + 'gloss/gloss_P.htm#pin')">pin</A> at a time. (The purpose of the application is not to 
compete with the Filter Graph Editor, but to demonstrate how to retrieve and 
manage the same underlying filter graph information using Visual Basic.) 
 
<P>The following illustration shows the same multimedia source file, 
Dolphin.mov, as depicted by the Builder Visual Basic-based sample application. 
 
<P><IMG SRC="../art/vbbld02.gif" WIDTH="490" HEIGHT="450" ALT="VB Builder sample"> 
 
<P>The list box labeled "Filters in current filter graph" lists the four 
filters required for this source file. The list box labeled "Pins in selected 
filter" lists the two pins defined for the selected Indeo Video R4.1 Decompression Filter: the 
"XForm In" and "XForm Out" pins. The XForm In pin is selected, so the 
application displays detailed information about this pin, including its 
direction and connection information. 
 
<P>The remainder of this article discusses the Visual Basic code you can 
use to retrieve and manage such filter graph information. In addition to the 
general-purpose code that works with any source input, the application 
includes a routine that illustrates a more likely use of these properties and 
methods&#151;building a specific hard-coded filter graph for your Visual Basic-based 
application. 
 
<P>This article assumes you have already set up your Visual Basic 
environment to use Quartz.dll. For more 
information about setting up your Visual Basic environment, see 
<A HREF="Control_Filter_Graphs_VB.htm">Controlling Filter Graphs Using Visual Basic</A>. 

<H2><A NAME="vbbld_2" IDX_CONCEPT="noindex; Quartz.dll in Visual Basic">About the DirectShow Quartz.dll Objects</A></H2>
<P>Quartz.dll provides objects that you can use in your Visual 
Basic-based applications to manage filters and pins. There is an implicit hierarchy 
among these objects; that is, you must often access the properties of one object to 
obtain another object. In the following example, an object that appears 
indented below another indicates that you obtain that lower-level object from 
a property or method of the higher-level object.
 
<PRE> 
Filter graph object (IMediaControl) 
  Filter collection (RegFilterCollection, FilterCollection properties) 
    Filter Info object (IFilterInfo or IRegFilterInfo in filter collection) 
      Pin collection (Pins property) 
        Pin Info object (IPinInfo item in pins collection) 
</PRE>

<P>The top-level object in the hierarchy is the filter graph object, or the <A HREF="../Appendixes/IMediaControl_Object.htm">IMediaControl</A> object, which represents the entire filter graph. You can access two properties of the <B>IMediaControl</B> object to obtain collections of filter objects. The <A HREF="../Appendixes/IMediaControl_Object.htm#IMediaControl_RegFilterCollection">RegFilterCollection</A>
property represents the filters registered with the system. The <A HREF="../Appendixes/IMediaControl_Object.htm#IMediaControl_FilterCollection">FilterCollection</A>
property represents the filters that are part of the filter graph. 

<P>As with other collections accessible to Visual Basic, you can access 
individual items in the collections by using the Visual Basic <B>for 
each...next</B> statement. The number of items in the collection is indicated by 
the <A HREF="../Appendixes/IAMCollection_Object.htm#IAMCollection_Count">Count</A> property of the collection. 
 
<P>The filter collection contains <A HREF="../Appendixes/IFilterInfo_Object.htm">IFilterInfo</A>
objects. Each <B>IFilterInfo</B> object
has a <A HREF="../Appendixes/IFilterInfo_Object.htm#IFilterInfo_Pins">Pins</A> property that represents
a collection of pins defined for that filter.
 
<P>The pins collection contains <A HREF="../Appendixes/IPinInfo_Object.htm">IPinInfo</A> objects.
Each <B>IPinInfo</B> object includes detailed information about that pin, including its media type and its connection to another pin. 
 
<P>To examine a specific pin on a filter in the filter graph, use the following procedure. 
 
<OL>
<LI>Obtain the filter graph object. 
<LI>Use the <A HREF="../Appendixes/IMediaControl_Object.htm#IMediaControl_FilterCollection">IMediaControl.FilterCollection</A> 
property of the filter graph object to obtain the
collection of filters present in the filter graph. 
<LI>Search through the filter collection for the specific filter. 
<LI>Use the <A HREF="../Appendixes/IFilterInfo_Object.htm#IFilterInfo_Pins">IFilterInfo.Pins</A> property of the filter object to
obtain the collection of pins
defined for the filter. 
<LI>Search through the pins collection for the specific pin. 
<LI>Examine the properties of the pin object to find connection information and 
other information for the pin. 
</OL>

<H2><A NAME="vbbld_3" IDX_CONCEPT="noindex; Visual Basic, creating a filter graph">Creating a Filter Graph</A></H2>
<P>There are three distinct ways to use Quartz.dll to create a filter graph; 
each way offers a different amount of control over the filter graph. These range 
from automatically generating the entire filter graph to specifying every 
filter and pin connection. The three approaches are as follows: 
 
<UL>
<LI>Automatic. 
<P>Generate the complete filter graph from either a multimedia source or a stored filter graph file. 
<LI>Semi-automatic.
<P>Create a new (empty) filter graph, add one or more filters, then automatically generate all filters and connections needed to 
render a specific pin. 
<LI>Manual. 
<P>Create a new (empty) filter graph, add individual filters to the graph, and explicitly add connections between pins. 
</UL>

<P>The sample application, Builder, demonstrates all three approaches. 
The application's "Generate from input file" command on the 
FilterGraph menu supports the first 
approach. The New command (empty) on the FilterGraph menu supports the other two 
approaches. 

<H2><A NAME="vbbld_4" IDX_CONCEPT="noindex; Visual Basic, generating a complete filter graph">Generating the Complete Filter Graph</A></H2>
<P>The following code fragment demonstrates how to generate the complete 
filter graph based on the multimedia source or stored filter graph. After 
creating an <A HREF="../Appendixes/IMediaControl_Object.htm">IMediaControl</A> object that is
initially "empty," the application calls the 
<A HREF="../Appendixes/IMediaControl_Object.htm#IMediaControl_RenderFile">IMediaControl.RenderFile</A> method to build up the complete graph.

<PRE>' fragment from the Filter Graph menu's Generate from input file command 
    ' start by creating a new, empty filter graph; 
    Dim g_objMC as IMediaControl  ' from the General Declarations section 
    ... 
    Set g_objMC = New FilgraphManager  ' create the new filter graph 
    ' ... 
    ' Use the common File Open dialog to let the user select the input file 
    CommonDialog1.ShowOpen  ' user selects a source or filter graph 
    ' call IMediaControl.RenderFile to add all filters and connect all pins
    g_objMC.RenderFile CommonDialog1.filename  ' generates the complete graph 
</PRE>

<H2><A NAME="vbbld_5" IDX_CONCEPT="noindex; Visual Basic, creating a new filter graph; Visual Basic, adding filters to the filter graph">Creating a New Filter Graph and Adding Filters</A></H2>
<P>The following code fragment demonstrates how to create the new (empty) filter graph object. 
 
<PRE>' fragment from the Filter Graph menu's New (empty) command handler 
    Dim g_objMC as IMediaControl  ' from the General Declarations section 
    ... 
    Set g_objMC = New FilgraphManager  ' create the new filter graph 
</PRE>

<P>When you choose to create an empty filter graph and add individual filters, 
you must know the filter type. In general, there are three categories of 
filters: source filters, transform filters, and renderer filters. The procedure 
for adding source filters uses a different method than the procedure for 
adding transform and renderer filters. 
 
<P>Add source filters to the filter graph by calling the
<A HREF="../Appendixes/IMediaControl_Object.htm#IMediaControl_AddSourceFilter">IMediaControl.AddSourceFilter</A> method and supplying the name of a file of the specified source type or stored filter graph. 
 
<P>The main form of the application includes a button labeled "Add Source 
Filter..." that uses the common File Open dialog box to query the user for the 
name of the source file or stored filter graph. The application supplies the 
specified file as the parameter to <A HREF="../Appendixes/IMediaControl_Object.htm#IMediaControl_AddSourceFilter">AddSourceFilter</A>.
 
<PRE>Dim objFilter As Object  ' temporary object for valid syntax; not used 
 
    CommonDialog1.ShowOpen  ' get the name of the source or filter graph file 
    g_objMC.AddSourceFilter CommonDialog1.filename, objFilter 
</PRE>

<P>Add transform and renderer filters to the filter graph by calling the
<A HREF="../Appendixes/IRegFilterInfo_Object.htm#IRegFilterInfo_Filter">IRegFilterInfo.Filter</A> method. The
<A HREF="../Appendixes/IRegFilterInfo_Object.htm">IRegFilterInfo</A> object can be obtained from
the <A HREF="../Appendixes/IMediaControl_Object.htm#IMediaControl_RegFilterCollection">IMediaControl.RegFilterCollection</A> 
property, which represents the collection of filter objects registered with the system and available for use. 
 
<P>After creating the filter graph and obtaining the
<A HREF="../Appendixes/IMediaControl_Object.htm">IMediaControl</A> object, use
the following procedure to add filters. 
 
<OL>
<LI>Obtain the list of registered filters by getting the
<A HREF="../Appendixes/IMediaControl_Object.htm#IMediaControl_RegFilterCollection">IMediaControl.RegFilterCollection</A>
property.
<LI>Search through the collection for the desired filter. Each element in the 
collection is an <A HREF="../Appendixes/IRegFilterInfo_Object.htm">IRegFilterInfo</A> object.
<LI>Add the filter to the filter graph by calling the
<A HREF="../Appendixes/IRegFilterInfo_Object.htm#IRegFilterInfo_Filter">IRegFilterInfo.Filter</A> method.
</OL>

<P>In the sample program, the list box labeled "Registered filters" contains 
the names of all the filters that appear in the
<A HREF="../Appendixes/IMediaControl_Object.htm#IMediaControl_RegFilterCollection">RegFilterCollection</A> property. The following
code fragment illustrates steps 1 and 2 in the previous procedure. 
 
<PRE> ' code fragment that populates the registered filter list box 
' global variable g_objRegFilters is set to IMediaControl.RegFilterCollection
' Set g_objRegFilters = g_objMC.RegFilterCollection 
Dim filter As IRegFilterInfo 
    listRegFilters.Clear 
    If Not g_objRegFilters Is Nothing Then 
        For Each filter In g_objRegFilters  ' for each filter in collection 
            listRegFilters.AddItem filter.Name ' add name to the list box 
        Next filter 
    End If 
</PRE>

<P>The sample application contains an Add button that adds the selected registered filter to the current filter graph. The following code fragment illustrates step 3 in the previous procedure. 
 
<PRE>' code fragment from the event handler for the "Add" button 
Dim filter As IRegFilterInfo 
' find the selected filter and add it to the graph 
' g_objRegFilters is the IMediaControl object RegFilterCollection property 
For Each filter In g_objRegFilters 
    If filter.Name = listRegFilters.Text Then  ' the selected filter? 
        Dim f As IFilterInfo  ' yes 
        filter.filter f  ' add to the filter graph, return IFilterInfo f 
        If f.IsFileSource Then 
            CommonDialog1.ShowOpen 
            f.filename = CommonDialog1.filename 
        End If 
        Exit For 
    End If 
Next filter 
</PRE>

<H2><A NAME="vbbld_6" IDX_CONCEPT="noindex; Visual Basic, connecting filter pins">Connecting Filter Pins</A></H2>
<P>After adding individual filters to the filter graph, you can establish 
connections between the filters by explicitly connecting each pin, or by 
automatically generating all connections that are needed downstream from a specific 
pin. 
 
<P>In both cases, you must traverse the hierarchy of DirectShow 
objects to obtain the
<A HREF="../Appendixes/IPinInfo_Object.htm">IPinInfo</A> object that represents a pin of the filter
object. This involves finding the desired filter in the filter collection of the filter graph object,
then finding the desired pin in the pin collection of the filter object.

<H3><A NAME="vbbld_7" IDX_CONCEPT="noindex; Visual Basic, listing filters in the filter graph">Listing Filters in the Filter Graph</A></H3>
<P>All filters in the filter graph are available in a collection that 
you can access using the
<A HREF="../Appendixes/IMediaControl_Object.htm#IMediaControl_FilterCollection">IMediaControl.FilterCollection</A> 
property.
 
<P>When the user adds a filter to the filter graph, the application 
refreshes the list of current filters by using the

<P>You can access the pins defined for a filter object through the
<A HREF="../Appendixes/IFilterInfo_Object.htm#IFilterInfo_Pins">IFilterInfo.Pins</A> property.
The <A HREF="../Appendixes/IFilterInfo_Object.htm#IFilterInfo_Pins">Pins</A> property is a collection of individual
<A HREF="../Appendixes/IPinInfo_Object.htm">IPinInfo</A> objects.
 
<P>After you obtain an individual
<A HREF="../Appendixes/IPinInfo_Object.htm">IPinInfo</A> object from the collection, you can
access its properties and call its methods, as shown in the following code fragment.

<PRE>For Each objPin In g_objSelFilter.Pins 
    If objPin.Name = listPins.Text Then  ' selected pin? 
        Set g_objSelPin = objPin ' yes, update information 
        ' ... perform operations using that pin 
    End If

<P>After you have obtained the pin object, you can explicitly connect to one 
other pin or automatically generate all subsequent pin connections needed to 
render the pin. 
 
<H3><A NAME="vbbld_9" IDX_CONCEPT="noindex; Visual Basic, explicitly connecting pins">Explicitly Connecting Two Pins</A></H3>
<P>The <A HREF="../Appendixes/IPinInfo_Object.htm">IPinInfo</A> object
provides three methods to connect pins: <A HREF="../Appendixes/IPinInfo_Object.htm#IPinInfo_Connect">Connect</A>,
<A HREF="../Appendixes/IPinInfo_Object.htm#IPinInfo_ConnectDirect">ConnectDirect</A>,
and <A HREF="../Appendixes/IPinInfo_Object.htm#IPinInfo_ConnectWithType">ConnectWithType</A>.
<B>Connect</B> adds other transform filters as
needed,
<B>ConnectDirect</B> does not add transform
filters, and <B>ConnectWithType</B>
performs the connection only if the specified pin matches the specified media 
type. 
 
<P>The sample application connects two pins using the
<A HREF="../Appendixes/IPinInfo_Object.htm#IPinInfo_Connect">IPinInfo.Connect</A> method, as shown in the following code fragment.
You can call the <A HREF="../Appendixes/IPinInfo_Object.htm#IPinInfo_Connect">Connect</A> method
from either of the two pins that are to be connected.

to automatically generate all
portions of the filter graph that are needed downstream from that pin. 
 
<P>The term <I>downstream</I> refers to all connections needed to construct a 
complete path from that pin to a renderer filter. For example, consider the 
representation of the filter graph by the Filter Graph Editor, which shows 
connections as moving from the source filter at the left to the renderer filter 
at the right. The <A HREF="../Appendixes/IPinInfo_Object.htm#IPinInfo_Render">Render</A> method adds all required filters 
and connections to
the right of the specified pin.

<H2><A NAME="vbbld_12" IDX_CONCEPT="noindex; Visual Basic, creating a custom graph">Creating a Custom Graph</A></H2>
<P>The sample application featured in this article is similar to the filter 
graph editor utility, allowing a user to create and manage any filter graph. 
Most applications will not provide such a general-purpose interface&#151;they are 
more likely to create only the specific filter graphs needed by the 
application. 
 
<P>The sample application provides one subroutine that creates such a custom 
filter graph. The Options menu offers a "Build custom graph" command that 
calls this subroutine. 
 
<P>The routine that handles this command creates five filter objects and eight 
pin objects. The routine then connects pins by calling the
<A HREF="../Appendixes/IPinInfo_Object.htm#IPinInfo_Connect">IPinInfo.Connect</A>
method. 
 
<P>The graph connects the following filters: AVI Source, AVI Decompressor, AVI Splitter, Video Renderer, and Audio Renderer. These filters can be connected by reusing just two pin object variables. For clarity, however, each pin object is defined using a name that indicates its position in the filter graph. 
 
<P>The filters and pins are declared as follows:
 
<PRE>
Dim pSourceFilter As IFilterInfo  ' AVI Source Filter; has two pins
Dim SourceOutputPin As IPinInfo  'Source Filter output pin

Dim pAVISplitter As IFilterInfo ' AVI Splitter
Dim SplitterInPin As IPinInfo   ' AVI Splitter pin "Input"
Dim SplitterOut00Pin As IPinInfo  ' AVI Splitter pin "Stream 00"
Dim SplitterOut01Pin As IPinInfo  ' AVI Splitter pin "Stream 01"

Dim pDECFilter As IFilterInfo  ' AVI Decompressor; has two pins
Dim DECInPin As IPinInfo   'AVI Decompressor pin "XForm In"
Dim DECOutPin As IPinInfo   ' AVI Decompressor pin "XForm Out"
    
Dim pVidRenderer As IFilterInfo ' Video Renderer, has one pin
Dim VidRendInPin As IPinInfo  ' Video Renderer pin "Input"

Dim pAudioRenderer As IFilterInfo 'Audio Renderer, has one pin
Dim AudioRendInPin As IPinInfo ' Audio Renderer pin "Input"
</PRE>

<P>The application adds the source filter object by calling the 
<A HREF="../Appendixes/IMediaControl_Object.htm#IMediaControl_AddSourceFilter">IMediaControl.AddSourceFilter</A>
method:
 
<PRE>' create the source filter using IMediaControl.AddSourceFilter
    CommonDialog1.ShowOpen  ' get the name of the source AVI file 
    g_objMC.AddSourceFilter CommonDialog1.filename, pSourceFilter 
</PRE>

<P>The application adds the other filter objects by searching for a 
specific name in the registered filter collection 
(the filter collection is available from the
<A HREF="../Appendixes/IMediaControl_Object.htm#IMediaControl_RegFilterCollection">IMediaControl.RegFilterCollection</A>
property), and calling the
<A HREF="../Appendixes/IRegFilterInfo_Object.htm#IRegFilterInfo_Filter">IRegFilterInfo.Filter</A>
method when it finds the specific filter to add:
 
<PRE>' add all non-source filters from the collection of registered filters 
    Set g_objRegFilters = g_objMC.RegFilterCollection 
' use the local subroutine AddFilter to find the filter named 
' "AVI Decompressor" in the collection, and set the variable pDECFilter 
    AddFilter "AVI Decompressor", pDECFilter  
</PRE>

<P>The AddFilter subroutine of the application loops through all the filters 
present in the collection. When the names match, it calls the
<A HREF="../Appendixes/IRegFilterInfo_Object.htm#IRegFilterInfo_Filter">IRegFilterInfo.Filter</A> method
to add the filter to the filter graph:
 
<PRE>Private Sub AddFilter(FName As String, f As IFilterInfo) 
' call IRegFilterInfo.Filter
 
    Set LocalRegFilters = g_objMC.RegFilterCollection 
    Dim filter As IRegFilterInfo 
    For Each filter In LocalRegFilters 
        If filter.Name = FName Then 
            filter.filter f 
            Exit For 
        End If 
    Next filter 
</PRE>

<P>The application calls similar code for the AVI Compressor, AVI Splitter, 
Video Renderer, and Audio Renderer filters. 
After obtaining all the filter objects, the application uses the
<A HREF="../Appendixes/IFilterInfo_Object.htm#IFilterInfo_Pins">IFilterInfo.Pins</A> property
to find specific pin objects. The code loops through
all pin objects in the collection, searching for the specific pin names and 
setting the individual pin objects when they are found, as shown in the following code fragment.
 
<PRE>' Get the source filter pin we need to build the graph 
For Each pPin In pSourceFilter.Pins
      Debug.Print pPin.Name
      If pPin.Name = "Output" Then
          Set SourceOutputPin = pPin
      End If
    Next pPin
    
'Add DEC filter
    AddFilter "AVI Decompressor", pDECFilter
    'Print out list of pins on decompressor filter
    For Each pPin In pDECFilter.Pins
      Debug.Print pPin.Name
      ' save specific pins to connect them
      If pPin.Name = "XForm In" Then
          Set DECInPin = pPin
      End If
      If pPin.Name = "XForm Out" Then
          Set DECOutPin = pPin
      End If
    Next pPin

'Add AVI Splitter
    AddFilter "AVI Splitter", pAVISplitter
    'Print out list of pins on decompressor filter
    For Each pPin In pAVISplitter.Pins
      Debug.Print pPin.Name
      ' save specific pins to connect them
      ' pin 0, pin 1
      If pPin.Name = "input pin" Then
          Set SplitterInPin = pPin
      ElseIf pPin.Name = "Stream 00" Then
          Set SplitterOut00Pin = pPin
      ElseIf pPin.Name = "Stream 01" Then
          Set SplitterOut01Pin = pPin
      End If
    Next pPin
    
</PRE>

<P>After initializing the eight pin objects, it is a simple matter to call the 
<A HREF="../Appendixes/IPinInfo_Object.htm#IPinInfo_Connect">IPinInfo.Connect</A> method to establish
the four connections between them.
The following code fragment demonstrates the connection calls. 
 
<PRE> 
' connect the pins 
' Note:  error handling omitted for brevity 
'Connect Source video output pin to AVI splitter input pin
    SourceOutputPin.Connect SplitterInPin
' Connect AVI splitter stream 00 to AVI decompressor
    SplitterOut00Pin.Connect DECInPin
' Connect AVI splitter stream 01 to audio renderer
    SplitterOut01Pin.Connect AudioRendInPin
 'Connect AVI decompressor output pin to Video renderer input pin
    DECOutPin.Connect VidRendInPin
</PRE>

<P>You can establish the connection from either pin; after 
a successful call to the <A HREF="../Appendixes/IPinInfo_Object.htm#IPinInfo_Connect">Connect</A> method,
you can access the connection
information from either pin object.
