<P>This article provides a general description of the Microsoft&#174; DirectShow&#153; class library, the relationship of the base classes to the DirectShow Component Object Model (COM) interfaces that they implement, and describes the utility classes that are not directly associated with interfaces. This article does not provide low-level descriptions of each class, nor does it provide specific instructions on how to use them to build a filter or run the <A CLASS="Glossary" HREF="javascript:Glossary(sRelPath + 'gloss/gloss_F.htm#filter_graph_manager')">filter graph manager</A>. 

<P>The DirectShow C++ class library can help you implement the required interfaces on filters that you write. Most base classes correspond directly to interfaces, while other utility classes allow integration of Microsoft Win32&#174; functionality, such as critical sections and thread management. 

<P>This article contains the following sections.
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="Intro_DS_C++_Class_Lib.htm#classes_1">Base Classes</A>
<LI><A HREF="Intro_DS_C++_Class_Lib.htm#classes_10">Utility Classes</A>
</UL>

<H2><A NAME="classes_1" IDX_CONCEPT="noindex; Base Classes, Introduction">Base Classes</A></H2>
<P>Most of the base classes in the DirectShow class library implement DirectShow COM interfaces. These classes produce C++ objects that provide an <A HREF="../iface/IUnknown.htm">IUnknown</A> interface so external components can access the interfaces the objects support.
<P>This section contains the following topics.
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="Intro_DS_C++_Class_Lib.htm#classes_2">CBaseObject and CUnknown Classes</A>
<LI><A HREF="Intro_DS_C++_Class_Lib.htm#classes_3">Base Classes that Implement Interfaces</A>
</UL>

<H3><A NAME="classes_2">CBaseObject and CUnknown Classes</A></H3>
<P>The <A HREF="CBaseObject.htm">CBaseObject</A> class is the root of all base classes. It exists primarily to provide debugging assistance by keeping a count of all DirectShow objects that are active. All derived base class constructors provide a debugging object name as the first parameter and call the <B>CBaseObject</B> constructor. You can view the debugging object name sent to this base class on a debugging monitor.

<P><IMG SRC="../../art/cbase01.gif" WIDTH="219" HEIGHT="83" ALT="CUnknown class hierarchy"> 

<P>All DirectShow classes that implement interfaces derive from a base class called <A HREF="CUnknown.htm">CUnknown</A>, which is derived from <A HREF="CBaseObject.htm">CBaseObject</A>. <B>CUnknown</B> implements the <A HREF="../utilfunct/INonDelegatingUnknown_iface.htm#INonDelegatingUnknown">INonDelegatingUnknown</A> interface which, like the <A HREF="../iface/IUnknown.htm">IUnknown</A> interface, provides methods to request an interface, and to add or release references to that interface. 

<P>Why are there two interfaces that implement the services of <A HREF="../iface/IUnknown.htm">IUnknown</A>? Because of <I>aggregation</I>. Aggregation is the COM term for the combining of more than one object into a single larger object. Although filter graph objects, such as filters and pins, are rarely aggregated, the design is available for future extensibility and also for implementing <A CLASS="Glossary" HREF="javascript:Glossary(sRelPath + 'gloss/gloss_P.htm#plug_in_distributor')">plug-in distributors</A> (PID), which are objects that are aggregated with the filter graph manager. In an aggregated object, the <I>outer object</I> (the one containing the other objects) uses the <B>IUnknown</B> interface to communicate outside the object. The <B>IUnknown</B> interface on the outer object passes out references to the <B>IUnknown</B> interfaces of its internal objects. That is, when an application calls the <B>IUnknown</B> interface on the outer object and asks for the interface belonging to one of its internal objects, the outer object calls the <B>IUnknown</B> interface of the internal object to retrieve the requested interface. 

<P>Because the internal objects must delegate <A HREF="../iface/IUnknown.htm">IUnknown</A> interfaces to the <B>IUnknown</B> of the outer object, the <B>IUnknown</B> interface of the internal object should not be accessed privately (that is, without going through the outer object's <B>IUnknown</B> interface). The internal object's <B>IUnknown</B> is reserved exclusively for communicating through the outer object. However, it is possible that objects will want to connect to other objects privately, without knowledge of the outer object. For example, pins on filters are likely to need to query interfaces on pins of 
other objects privately. 

<P>The <A HREF="../utilfunct/INonDelegatingUnknown_iface.htm#INonDelegatingUnknown">INonDelegatingUnknown</A> interface provides direct, private access to interfaces, regardless of whether or not the object is aggregated. Direct access is important in most of the communication between the DirectShow objects such as pins, allocators, and filters, and is the default method of communication. In fact, the base classes implement the <A HREF="../iface/IUnknown.htm">IUnknown</A> interface on 
nonaggregated objects (which includes almost every object in the <A CLASS="Glossary" HREF="javascript:Glossary(sRelPath + 'gloss/gloss_F.htm#filter_graph')">filter graph</A>) to call the nondelegating interface directly. 

<H3><A NAME="classes_3">Base Classes that Implement Interfaces</A></H3>
<P>The majority of classes in the DirectShow class library implement COM interfaces and can be categorized as follows:
<UL>
<LI>Filter base classes implement the <A HREF="../iface/IBaseFilter.htm">IBaseFilter</A> interface, and include <A HREF="CBaseFilter.htm">CBaseFilter</A> and classes derived from it. 
<LI>Pin classes implement the <A HREF="../iface/IPin.htm">IPin</A> interface, and include <A HREF="CBasePin.htm">CBasePin</A> and derived classes.
<LI>Enumerator classes include <A HREF="CEnumPins.htm">CEnumPins</A> and <A HREF="CEnumMediaTypes.htm">CEnumMediaTypes</A>. 
<LI><A CLASS="Glossary" HREF="javascript:Glossary(sRelPath + 'gloss/gloss_T.htm#transport')">Transport</A> base classes include <A HREF="CMediaSample.htm">CMediaSample</A>, <A HREF="CBaseAllocator.htm">CBaseAllocator</A>, <A HREF="CMemAllocator.htm">CMemAllocator</A>, and their derived classes. These classes share memory between pins and pass media samples using that memory.
<LI>Control and position classes include <A HREF="CBaseFilter.htm">CBaseFilter</A>, <A HREF="CMediaPosition.htm">CMediaPosition</A>, <A HREF="CMediaControl.htm">CMediaControl</A>, <A HREF="CBaseMediaFilter.htm">CBaseMediaFilter</A>, <A HREF="CSourceSeeking.htm">CSourceSeeking</A>, and <A HREF="CBaseStreamControl.htm">CBaseStreamControl</A>.

<H4><A NAME="classes_4">Filter Base Classes</A></H4>
<P>The DirectShow stream architecture is based on filters and pins. Filters communicate with the filter graph manager and with the pins on the filter. Pins connect filters and handle transporting 
the data down the stream.

<P><IMG SRC="../../art/basecl1.gif" WIDTH="355" HEIGHT="443" ALT="Hierarchy of filter base classes"> 

<P><A HREF="CBaseFilter.htm">CBaseFilter</A> is the base class for all filter classes. It implements the <A HREF="../iface/IBaseFilter.htm">IBaseFilter</A> interface, which specifies methods that allow the filter graph manager to create and enumerate pins, retrieve filter information, and notify the filter that it has been added to a filter graph. <B>CBaseFilter</B> also implements the <A HREF="../iface/IMediaFilter.htm">IMediaFilter</A> interface (from which <B>IBaseFilter</B> derives) to allow the filter to receive run, pause, and stop commands from the filter graph manager. This base class adds member functions to retrieve the <A CLASS="Glossary" HREF="javascript:Glossary(sRelPath + 'gloss/gloss_P.htm#pin')">pin</A> count, retrieve pointers to individual pins, and retrieve the pin version.

<P>The <A HREF="CBaseMediaFilter.htm">CBaseMediaFilter</A> class also implements the <A HREF="../iface/IMediaFilter.htm">IMediaFilter</A> interface. However, because <B>IMediaFilter</B> is also implemented by <A HREF="CBaseFilter.htm">CBaseFilter</A>, this class is seldom used except to write a plug-in distributor (PID). 

<P>Several classes are derived directly from <A HREF="CBaseFilter.htm">CBaseFilter</A>. Each of these classes provides a base class for implementing a specific type of filter. These include:

<UL>
<LI><A HREF="CSource.htm">CSource</A>, a base class for <A CLASS="Glossary" HREF="javascript:Glossary(sRelPath + 'gloss/gloss_S.htm#source_filter')">source filters</A>.
<LI><A HREF="CTransformFilter.htm">CTransformFilter</A>, a base class for <A CLASS="Glossary" HREF="javascript:Glossary(sRelPath + 'gloss/gloss_T.htm#transform_filter')">transform filters</A>.
<LI><A HREF="CBaseRenderer.htm">CBaseRenderer</A>, a base class for <A CLASS="Glossary" HREF="javascript:Glossary(sRelPath + 'gloss/gloss_R.htm#renderer')">renderer</A> filters.
</UL>

<P>The <A HREF="CSource.htm">CSource</A> filter class works in conjunction with the <A HREF="CSourceStream.htm">CSourceStream</A> pin class to help create a source filter. Most of the work is done in the pin class, and <B>CSource</B> adds pin creation and deletion member functions. The <A HREF="CSourcePosition.htm">CSourcePosition</A> class implements a source filter.

<P>The <A HREF="CTransformFilter.htm">CTransformFilter</A> class implements a transform filter. Derive your transform class from <B>CTransformFilter</B> if you want to make a copy of the data. The <A HREF="CTransInPlaceFilter.htm">CTransInPlaceFilter</A> class, derived from <B>CTransformFilter</B>, allows in-place transforms that do not copy the data. These transform filter classes work in conjunction with similarly named pin classes (for example, <A HREF="CTransformOutputPin.htm">CTransformOutputPin</A> and <A HREF="CTransformInputPin.htm">CTransformInputPin</A>). Most member functions in the pin classes are implemented to call member functions in the transform filter class, so typically you need only to derive your filter from the filter class and override a few member functions to implement a transform filter.

<P><A HREF="CTransformFilter.htm">CTransformFilter</A> adds several member functions to those inherited from <A HREF="CBaseFilter.htm">CBaseFilter</A>. Some of these are pure virtual member functions that the derived class must override. One example is the <A HREF="CTransformFilter.htm#Transform">CTransformFilter::Transform</A> member function, which is called when the <A CLASS="Glossary" HREF="javascript:Glossary(sRelPath + 'gloss/gloss_I.htm#input_pin')">input pin</A> receives a sample. This member function provides the core of the transform functionality. Other member functions to be overridden also involve implementations that are specific to the derived class, such as verifying media types on pins and allocating the correct amount of memory. Additionally, several <B>CTransformFilter</B> member functions are called at various points in the connection or streaming process; the derived class can override these to handle requirements such as adding or releasing references to interfaces.

<P>The <A HREF="CVideoTransformFilter.htm">CVideoTransformFilter</A> class derives from the <A HREF="CTransformFilter.htm">CTransformFilter</A> class and is used as a base class for filters that can affect the quality of a rendered video by dropping frames when the video renderer sends quality-control messages. This class is primarily used by video decompressors in the DirectShow <A CLASS="Glossary" HREF="javascript:Glossary(sRelPath + 'gloss/gloss_R.htm#run_time')">run time</A>. 

<P>The <A HREF="CBaseRenderer.htm">CBaseRenderer</A> class and its derived class, <A HREF="CBaseVideoRenderer.htm">CBaseVideoRenderer</A>, are the base filter classes that implement a video renderer filter. The video renderer filter used in DirectShow is derived from <B>CBaseVideoRenderer</B>. There are other renderer classes that work in conjunction with these classes but are not derived from <A HREF="CBaseFilter.htm">CBaseFilter</A>. These classes are:

<UL>
<LI><A HREF="CRendererInputPin.htm">CRendererInputPin</A>
<LI><A HREF="CBaseControlVideo.htm">CBaseControlVideo</A> and its base class <A HREF="CBaseBasicVideo.htm">CBaseBasicVideo</A> 
<LI><A HREF="CBaseControlWindow.htm">CBaseControlWindow</A>, and its base classes <A HREF="CBaseVideoWindow.htm">CBaseVideoWindow</A> and <A HREF="CBaseWindow.htm">CBaseWindow</A>
<LI><A HREF="CAggDirectDraw.htm">CAggDirectDraw</A>
<LI><A HREF="CAggDrawSurface.htm">CAggDrawSurface</A>
</UL>

<P>The following illustration shows all the classes that support renderers that are not derived from either <A HREF="CBaseFilter.htm">CBaseFilter</A> or <A HREF="CBasePin.htm">CBasePin</A>.

<P><IMG SRC="../../art/basecl6.gif" WIDTH="520" HEIGHT="361" ALT="Hierarchy of classes that support renderers that aren't derived from CBaseFilter or CBasePin">

<H4><A NAME="classes_5">Pin Base Classes</A></H4>
<P>Pins have a greater share of the work than filters. A pin must expose methods so that the filter graph manager can connect it with a pin on another filter. Pins also expose methods so that connected pins can negotiate what media type they will pass between them, and which pin will provide the shared memory allocator for transporting the media sample. Additionally, the <A CLASS="Glossary" HREF="javascript:Glossary(sRelPath + 'gloss/gloss_O.htm#output_pin')">output pin</A> is responsible for passing each media sample to its connected input pin; the input pin is responsible for receiving it. Finally, pins must support interfaces so that quality-control messages and position information can be passed through the stream from pin to pin.

<P>The following illustration shows the pin classes. All pin classes are derived from <A HREF="CBasePin.htm">CBasePin</A>, a base class derived from <A HREF="CUnknown.htm">CUnknown</A>.

<P><IMG SRC="../../art/basecl2.gif" WIDTH="365" HEIGHT="507" ALT="Hierarchy of pin base classes"> 

<P><A HREF="CBasePin.htm">CBasePin</A> implements the <A HREF="../iface/IPin.htm">IPin</A> interface. The <B>IPin</B> interface specifies methods for connecting to other pins, negotiating the media type to be used with the connected pin, querying internal connections on the pin, and informing the pin of stream activity.

<P>Besides implementing the <A HREF="../iface/IPin.htm">IPin</A> methods, <A HREF="CBasePin.htm">CBasePin</A> also implements <A HREF="../iface/IQualityControl.htm">IQualityControl</A> methods so that quality-control messages can be passed through the filter graph from one pin to the next. Quality-control messages allow a filter, such as a renderer, to request another filter to adjust its sample rate. Typically, quality-control messages travel upstream from renderer to source filter. However, in cases such as a video capture filter, the source filter (for example, a VCR reader) can send quality-control messages downstream to the renderer filter to adjust its rate.

<P>The <A HREF="CBasePin.htm">CBasePin</A> class provides several virtual member functions that can be overridden to provide handling of the connection, media type negotiation, and disconnection processes. 
Two base classes derive from <B>CBasePin</B> to provide default handling for many of these tasks:

<UL>
<LI><A HREF="CBaseOutputPin.htm">CBaseOutputPin</A> implements an output pin.
<LI><A HREF="CBaseInputPin.htm">CBaseInputPin</A> implements an input pin.
</UL>

<P><A HREF="CBaseOutputPin.htm">CBaseOutputPin</A> is the base class for the <A HREF="CTransformOutputPin.htm">CTransformOutputPin</A> and <A HREF="CSourceStream.htm">CSourceStream</A> classes. Likewise, <A HREF="CBaseInputPin.htm">CBaseInputPin</A> is the base class for the <A HREF="CTransformInputPin.htm">CTransformInputPin</A> class. Before looking at these derived base pin classes, it is helpful to understand the basic model the <B>CBaseOutputPin</B> and <B>CBaseInputPin</B> classes use.

<P>In the connection and transport model used by two pins, the input pin supports the 
<A HREF="../iface/IMemInputPin.htm">IMemInputPin</A> interface so that it can receive a media sample. 
 The <A HREF="CBaseInputPin.htm">CBaseInputPin</A> class implements the <B>IMemInputPin</B> interface. 
Also, one of the two pins must supply a shared memory allocator object, which is an object that contains 
the <A HREF="../iface/IMemAllocator.htm">IMemAllocator</A> interface that generates media sample objects passed between pins. An <B>IMemInputPin</B> method, implemented by the <B>CBaseInputPin</B> class, supplies this allocator object, implemented by the <A HREF="CMemAllocator.htm">CMemAllocator</A> class. The connected output pin also has the option of supplying its own allocator; if this is the case, it notifies the input pin (through another <B>IMemInputPin</B> method) of the final decision of which allocator is used.

<P>The <A HREF="CBaseOutputPin.htm">CBaseOutputPin</A> class provides extra member functions 
to set the size and count of samples in the allocator, retrieve a media sample from the allocator, 
deliver that media sample to the connected input pin, and deliver end-of-stream and end-flush 
messages downstream. It also implements many of the <A HREF="../iface/IPin.htm">IPin</A> methods.

<P><A HREF="CPullPin.htm">CPullPin</A> is a class that is used on the input pin of a <A CLASS="Glossary" HREF="javascript:Glossary(sRelPath + 'gloss/gloss_P.htm#parser_filter')">parser filter</A>. It is derived from the <A HREF="CAMThread.htm">CAMThread</A> class as shown in the following illustration.

<P><IMG SRC="../../art/pulpin01.gif" WIDTH="205" HEIGHT="56" ALT="CPullPin class hierarchy">

<P>A <I>parser filter</I> pulls information from the disk, 
using the asynchronous file reader filter, or from the Internet, using the URL <A CLASS="Glossary" HREF="javascript:Glossary(sRelPath + 'gloss/gloss_M.htm#moniker')">moniker</A> filter. 
<A HREF="CPullPin.htm">CPullPin</A> works with the <A HREF="../iface/IAsyncReader.htm">IAsyncReader</A>
interface, which is implemented on the source reader filter upstream. 
<B>CPullPin</B> starts the thread, pulls data from the <A CLASS="Glossary" HREF="javascript:Glossary(sRelPath + 'gloss/gloss_U.htm#upstream_filter')">upstream filter</A>, and then 
pushes the data downstream. That is, it can simply call its own <A HREF="../iface/IMemInputPin.htm#Receive">IMemInputPin::Receive</A> 
method after pulling the sample from the source (or perform the equivalent routines elsewhere). 


<H4><A NAME="classes_6">Enumerator Base Classes</A></H4>
<P>An <I>enumerator</I> is an interface that provides methods for traversing a list of elements. 
Enumerators are used in COM programming, and the DirectShow model follows the COM model in enumerating objects. Two enumerator classes are provided in the class library: <A HREF="CEnumPins.htm">CEnumPins</A>, which implements the <A HREF="../iface/IEnumPins.htm">IEnumPins</A> interfaces, and <A HREF="CEnumMediaTypes.htm">CEnumMediaTypes</A>, which implements the <A HREF="../iface/IEnumMediaTypes.htm">IEnumMediaTypes</A> interface. Two other DirectShow enumerator interfaces, <A HREF="../iface/IEnumFilters.htm">IEnumFilters</A> and <A HREF="../iface/IEnumRegFilters.htm">IEnumRegFilters</A>, are not represented by base classes because they are implemented only by the filter graph manager.

<P><IMG SRC="../../art/basecl3.gif" WIDTH="195" HEIGHT="111" ALT="Hierarchy of enumerator base classes"> 

<P>The <A HREF="CEnumPins.htm">CEnumPins</A> class creates an enumerator when the <A HREF="../iface/IBaseFilter.htm#EnumPins">IBaseFilter::EnumPins</A> 
method is called. The enumerator returned by this method is a pointer to the <A HREF="../iface/IEnumPins.htm">IEnumPins</A> interface, which is implemented by the <B>CEnumPins</B> class. The <B>CEnumPins</B> member functions can 
then be called to retrieve pointers to each of the pins on the filter, which this enumerator accomplishes 
by calling the <A HREF="CBaseFilter.htm#GetPin">CBaseFilter::GetPin</A> member function on the filter. The filter must override the base class <B>CBaseFilter::GetPin</B> member function to supply the enumerator with the next
pin in the list each time it is called.

<P>The <A HREF="CEnumMediaTypes.htm">CEnumMediaTypes</A> class creates an enumerator when the 
<A HREF="../iface/IPin.htm#EnumMediaTypes">IPin::EnumMediaTypes</A> method is called. Pins store a list of the media types that they 
support. During negotiation of the media type, one pin typically calls the 
<A HREF="../iface/IPin.htm#EnumMediaTypes">EnumMediaTypes</A> method on its connected pin, retrieves the enumerator, and uses it to select a media type. Both of these enumerator classes support the <B>Next</B>, <B>Skip</B>, <B>Reset</B>, and <B>Clone</B> methods familiar to COM programmers. The media type enumerators call the <A HREF="CBasePin.htm#GetMediaType">CBasePin::GetMediaType</A> member function, which must be overridden by the derived pin class, to return the next media type in a list of media types accepted by the pin.

<P>Enumerators operate as threads, and must have synchronized access to the pin media 
type list. For this reason, the classes that implement enumerators inherit (through multiple inheritance) 
from the <A HREF="CCritSec.htm">CCritSec</A> class, which provides critical section management. For more information about the <B>CCritSec</B> class, see <A HREF="Intro_DS_C++_Class_Lib.htm#classes_11">Win32 Classes</A>.

<H4><A NAME="classes_7">Transport Base Classes</A></H4>
<P>Transport classes share memory between pins and pass media samples using that memory. DirectShow provides four classes to help implement shared memory transports:

<P><IMG SRC="../../art/basecl4.gif" WIDTH="315" HEIGHT="233" ALT="Hierarchy of transport base classes"> 

<P>The <A HREF="../iface/IMemAllocator.htm">IMemAllocator</A> interface on the input pin specifies methods to set the number and size of the buffers to allocate, allocates that memory, frees that memory, and returns a single buffer that contains 
an <A HREF="../iface/IMediaSample.htm">IMediaSample</A> interface. The output pin connected to the input pin calls the <B>IMemAllocator</B> methods. <A HREF="CBaseAllocator.htm">CBaseAllocator</A> provides the member functions 
<A HREF="CBaseAllocator.htm#Alloc">Alloc</A> and <A HREF="CBaseAllocator.htm#Free">Free</A> 
that are called from the <A HREF="../iface/IMemAllocator.htm#Commit">Commit</A> and 
<A HREF="../iface/IMemAllocator.htm#Decommit">Decommit</A> methods. Derived classes override the 
<B>Alloc</B> and <B>Free</B> member functions 
to provide their own routines to allocate and free memory.

<P>Because <A HREF="CBaseAllocator.htm">CBaseAllocator</A> performs very little implementation by itself, most pins use the 
<A HREF="CMemAllocator.htm">CMemAllocator</A> class, which is derived from <B>CBaseAllocator</B>. 
<B>CMemAllocator</B> overrides the <A HREF="CBaseAllocator.htm#Free">CBaseAllocator::Free</A> member function to provide allocation of media samples based on system memory. It provides its own member function, called 
<A HREF="CMemAllocator.htm#ReallyFree">ReallyFree</A>, to be called when the allocator is finally released.

<P><A HREF="CMediaSample.htm">CMediaSample</A> is a class that contains the media sample data and also provides member 
functions to access properties on the media sample, such as data type or beginning and ending 
<A CLASS="Glossary" HREF="javascript:Glossary(sRelPath + 'gloss/gloss_T.htm#time_stamp')">time stamps</A>. This class implements the <A HREF="../iface/IMediaSample.htm">IMediaSample</A> interface, which provides the 
method specification. <A HREF="CImageSample.htm">CImageSample</A> derives from <B>CMediaSample</B> and is used
by the video renderer when the renderer's allocator is being used. It uses all the
<B>CMediaSample</B> interface 
methods and adds two methods to set and retrieve the 
<A HREF="../../appendixes/Further_Reading.htm#DIBSECTION">DIBSECTION</A> information. This makes it easy for the renderer to cast the 
<B>CMediaSample</B> pointer it receives from an upstream filter to a <B>CImageSample</B>
pointer, and obtain a handle to the bitmap of the video frame.

<H4><A NAME="classes_8">Media Control and Positioning Classes</A></H4>
<P>Media control interfaces pass commands such as <B>Run</B>, <B>Stop</B>, or <B>Pause</B> from an application through the filter graph manager to the individual filters. From the filter's perspective, the only control interface necessary is <A HREF="../iface/IMediaFilter.htm">IMediaFilter</A>, which exposes methods to accept and implement these commands. The <A HREF="CBaseFilter.htm">CBaseFilter</A> class implements this interface. All other interfaces that expose media control methods are handled by the filter graph manager and are therefore already implemented. Although a <A HREF="CMediaControl.htm">CMediaControl</A> class exists and implements the <A HREF="../iface/IMediaControl.htm">IMediaControl</A> interface, it is not often used because the filter graph manager is responsible for this functionality. The following illustration shows the relationship between these classes and interfaces.

<P><IMG SRC="../../art/basecl5.gif" WIDTH="323" HEIGHT="489" ALT="Hierarchy of media control and positioning base classes">

<P>Media positioning interfaces start the media stream at a specified position, play the stream
 for a specified period of time, or change the rate of the media stream. The <A HREF="../iface/IMediaPosition.htm">IMediaPosition</A> 
interface is the primary interface supporting this functionality. The <A HREF="CMediaPosition.htm">CMediaPosition</A> class 
implements this interface and serves as a base class for two other classes: <A HREF="CPosPassThru.htm">CPosPassThru</A> and <A HREF="CSourcePosition.htm">CSourcePosition</A>.

<P>Typically, the filter graph manager calls the <A HREF="../iface/IMediaPosition.htm">IMediaPosition</A> interface on the renderer 
filters when it wants to position the media stream. The renderer acknowledges the sample times that 
it will be expected to display and then passes the media positioning data upstream, destined for a 
seekable filter, such as a source file filter, that can provide the properly positioned source stream. 
To pass that information upstream, output pins must be able to receive the positioning information. 
<P>The <A HREF="CPosPassThru.htm">CPosPassThru</A> class implements the <A HREF="../iface/IMediaPosition.htm">IMediaPosition</A> interface
and the <A HREF="../iface/IMediaSeeking.htm">IMediaSeeking</A> interface on the output pins of filters and, for the most part, does nothing but call the corresponding interface on the output pin of the next upstream filter, thereby passing through the positioning data. <B>IMediaSeeking</B> is different than <B>IMediaPosition</B> in that it allows the media stream to be seeked to units other than time, such as frames, samples, or indexed <A CLASS="Glossary" HREF="javascript:Glossary(sRelPath + 'gloss/gloss_f.htm#field')">fields</A> in an 
MPEG format. The <A HREF="CRendererPosPassThru.htm">CRendererPosPassThru</A> class, implemented on a video renderer, 
sets the start and end <A CLASS="Glossary" HREF="javascript:Glossary(sRelPath + 'gloss/gloss_R.htm#reference_time')">reference times</A> on individual samples, so that samples can be queried at any time for this information. This is helpful when dealing with seeking using <B>IMediaSeeking</B>, which seeks to <I><A CLASS="Glossary" HREF="javascript:Glossary(sRelPath + 'gloss/gloss_M.htm#media_time')">media time</A></I>, and does not keep track of the sample's reference time. 

<P>The reason for serially informing every filter in the graph of the new position is to allow filters that might be concerned with media positioning to be prepared for the new position. Certain stream splitters, for example, might be splitting off streams with media positions relative to the main media stream. This is why the filter graph manager does not simply call the source filter's <A HREF="../iface/IMediaPosition.htm">IMediaPosition</A> or <A HREF="../iface/IMediaSeeking.htm">IMediaSeeking</A> interface directly.

<P><A HREF="CSourcePosition.htm">CSourcePosition</A> is the class that helps the source filter implement its <A HREF="../iface/IMediaPosition.htm">IMediaPosition</A> interface.

<P>The <A HREF="CSourceSeeking.htm">CSourceSeeking</A> class helps the source filter implement its <A HREF="../iface/IMediaSeeking.htm">IMediaSeeking</A> interface. This class enables a source filter to handle calls that change the start and stop positions in the media stream, and the playback rate. 

<P>The <A HREF="CBaseStreamControl.htm">CBaseStreamControl</A> class helps the source filter implement its <A HREF="../iface/IAMStreamControl.htm">IAMStreamControl</A> interface. This class is used primarily by capture filters. The following illustration shows the relationship between <B>CBaseStreamControl</B> and the interfaces from which it inherits.

<P><IMG SRC="../../art/basecl7.gif" WIDTH="231" HEIGHT="82" ALT="Hierarchy of CBaseStreamControl base class">


<H4><A NAME="classes_9">Clock Base Classes</A></H4>
<P>DirectShow provides two classes, <A HREF="CBaseReferenceClock.htm">CBaseReferenceClock</A> and <A HREF="CSystemClock.htm">CSystemClock</A> to help implement clocks in the filter graph. The following illustration shows the relationship between these classes and the interfaces they implement.

<P><IMG SRC="../../art/dclock01.gif" WIDTH="323" HEIGHT="229" ALT="Hierarchy of clock base classes"> 

<P><A HREF="CBaseReferenceClock.htm">CBaseReferenceClock</A> implements <A HREF="../iface/IReferenceClock.htm">IReferenceClock</A>, and so provides the ability to return the correct
reference time when requested, and to <A CLASS="Glossary" HREF="javascript:Glossary(sRelPath + 'gloss/gloss_A.htm#advise')">advise</A> registered objects of specific times or
time intervals through <A CLASS="Glossary" HREF="javascript:Glossary(sRelPath + 'gloss/gloss_E.htm#event_notification')">event notification</A> and semaphores. 

<P><A HREF="CSystemClock.htm">CSystemClock</A> implements a system clock that provides time information and
timing signals to an application. It uses the <A HREF="CBaseReferenceClock.htm">CBaseReferenceClock</A> base 
class to provide most of that functionality, overriding the actual time calls. 


<H2><A NAME="classes_10" IDX_CONCEPT="noindex; Utility Classes, Introduction"></A>Utility Classes</H2>
<P>The DirectShow SDK includes several utility classes that provide C++ class encapsulation 
of many of the required Win32 functions, multimedia data structures, and object list and queue 
manipulation. These classes are briefly described in this section, which contains the following topics.

<H3><A NAME="classes_11">Win32 Classes</A></H3>
<P>DirectShow implements several classes to handle Win32 threads, events, and critical sections. These include the following classes.
<UL>

<P>The following diagram illustrates these classes.

<P><IMG SRC="../../art/miscl1.gif" WIDTH="205" HEIGHT="216" ALT="Hierarchy of Win32 utility classes"> 

<P><A HREF="CAMEvent.htm">CAMEvent</A> handles a Win32 event as a C++ object. The methods in this class allow events to be put into the signaled 
state or reset to a nonsignaled state, and also allow a caller to block
until an event is signaled. 
Events can also be cast to handles and passed to the Win32 <A HREF="../../appendixes/Further_Reading.htm#WaitForMultipleObjec">WaitForMultipleObjects</A> function.

<P><A HREF="CCritSec.htm">CCritSec</A> handles a Win32 critical section as a C++ object to provide intraprocess synchronization. 
Methods of this class allow you to create, lock, and unlock a critical section. 

<P><A HREF="CAutoLock.htm">CAutoLock</A> holds a critical section (a <A HREF="CCritSec.htm">CCritSec</A> object) for the scope of a block or function. The 
critical section is locked in the constructor and unlocked in the destructor.

<P><A HREF="CAMThread.htm">CAMThread</A> provides an abstract worker thread class enabling creation, synchronization, and communication with 
a worker thread.

<P><A HREF="CMsgThread.htm">CMsgThread</A> provides support for a worker thread to which requests can be posted asynchronously instead 
of being sent directly. Messages, in the form of a <A HREF="CMsg.htm">CMsg</A> object, can be posted to a 
<B>CMsgThread</B> object.

<P><A HREF="CMsg.htm">CMsg</A> creates an object containing a message to be passed to a <A HREF="CMsgThread.htm">CMsgThread</A> object.

<P>DirectShow implements the <A HREF="CBaseList.htm">CBaseList</A>, <A HREF="CGenericList.htm">CGenericList</A>, and <A HREF="COutputQueue.htm">COutputQueue</A> classes for handling lists and queues as illustrated in the following diagram.

<P><IMG SRC="../../art/miscl3.gif" WIDTH="227" HEIGHT="184" ALT="Hierarchy of list and queue utility classes">

<P><A HREF="CBaseList.htm">CBaseList</A> represents a linked list data structure
 of typeless pointers to objects 
derived from <A HREF="CBaseObject.htm">CBaseObject</A>. 

<P><A HREF="CGenericList.htm">CGenericList</A> implements a template class derived from <A HREF="CBaseList.htm">CBaseList</A> that calls <B>CBaseList</B> member functions and adds type checking for the type specified in the template.

<P><A HREF="COutputQueue.htm">COutputQueue</A> supports the queuing of media samples from the output pin of a filter. The output pin calls 
member functions of this class instead of calling methods on the connected input pin to receive 
the media sample. The output pin is then free to continue without blocking, while the 
<B>COutputQueue</B> class handles the passing of the media samples downstream. 

<H3><A NAME="classes_13">Multimedia Data Type Classes</A></H3>
<P>DirectShow implements the <A HREF="CMediaType.htm">CMediaType</A>, <A HREF="CRefTime.htm">CRefTime</A>, and <A HREF="FOURCCMap.htm">FOURCCMap</A> multimedia data type classes as shown in the following illustration.

<P><IMG SRC="../../art/miscl2.gif" WIDTH="205" HEIGHT="183" ALT="Hierarchy of multimedia data type classes"> 

<P><A HREF="CMediaType.htm">CMediaType</A> provides a C++ class object containing the media type data structure 
and methods that provide access to each of the members of the structure.

<A HREF="../../appendixes/Further_Reading.htm#CClassFactory">CClassFactory</A> and <A HREF="CFactoryTemplate.htm">CFactoryTemplate</A> are implemented by the base classes to handle automatic instantiation of filters, pins, and other DirectShow COM objects. 

These classes provide a scaffolding for object construction which wraps the actual COM elements required to construct an object.

<A HREF="CPersistStream.htm">CPersistStream</A> and <A HREF="CBasePropertyPage.htm">CBasePropertyPage</A> help with implementing COM persistent storage and property page interfaces.

<P><A HREF="../../appendixes/Further_Reading.htm#CClassFactory">CClassFactory</A>, located in dllentry.cpp, inherits from <A HREF="CBaseObject.htm">CBaseObject</A> and implements the COM <A HREF="../../appendixes/Further_Reading.htm#IClassFactory">IClassFactory</A> interface. This interface is used by <A HREF="../../appendixes/Further_Reading.htm#CoCreateInstance">CoCreateInstance</A>, which instantiates a COM object by calling <A HREF="../../appendixes/Further_Reading.htm#IClassFactory__Creat">IClassFactory::CreateInstance</A>, which, in turn, calls the static <B>CreateInstance</B> member function in your derived class. 

<P>The base classes use <A HREF="CFactoryTemplate.htm">CFactoryTemplate</A> to provide <A HREF="../../appendixes/Further_Reading.htm#CClassFactory">CClassFactory</A> with a template containing the CLSID of your object and a pointer to the static <B>CreateInstance</B> function for your object class. 
 
<P><A HREF="CPersistStream.htm">CPersistStream</A> implements COM <A HREF="../../appendixes/Further_Reading.htm#IPersistStream">IPersistStream</A> for the storage and retrieval of filter properties in a saved filter graph.

<P><A HREF="CBasePropertyPage.htm">CBasePropertyPage</A> implements the COM <A HREF="../../appendixes/Further_Reading.htm#IPropertyPage">IPropertyPage</A> interface, which provides a framework for a property page associated with a filter. 


<H3><A NAME="classes_15">Debugging Classes</A></H3>
<P>DirectShow provides many debugging functions and macros as described in the <A HREF="../debug/Debugging_intro.htm#fm_debugging">Debugging</A> reference section. It also includes three classes that aid in debugging filter development:
