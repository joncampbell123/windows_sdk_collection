<h3><a name="Overview"><strong>Overview</strong></a></h3>

<p>Starting with DirectX 8.0, DirectShow will become part 
  of the standard DirectX install. This is the final version of the DirectX 
  Media SDK. This version of&nbsp;DirectShow is identical to that which shipped 
  on the DirectX 6.1 SDK.
  <P>To get started with the DirectShow SDK, please do the following:
<ul>
<li>Read the "Getting Started" section of the DirectShow SDK documentation, including the "What's New in the DirectShow SDK?" article.
<li>Read the license information. Licensing information 
    for the SDK and redistributable files is located in the License.doc file in 
    the root of the CD.</li>                       
</ul>

<p>The directory structure for the samples has changed in this release to enable future integration with the Microsoft Platform SDK. You'll now find the DirectShow sample source code installed in the samples\multimedia\dshow\src directory off of your DirectX media installation directory.

<h3><a name="New Since DirectShow 5.1"><strong>New Since DirectShow 5.2</strong></a></h3>                       
 
<P><B>Expanded MPEG-2 Support</B>
<P>DirectShow has two new filters, the MPEG-2 Splitter Filter and the MultiFile Source Filter, and two new interfaces, <B>IAMParse</B> and <B>IMultiFileReader</B>, to support MPEG-2 applications.

<P><B>Support for Playing Video from Within Applications that Are Using DirectDraw Exclusive Mode</B>
<P>The new <B>IDDrawExclModeVideo</B> interface enables games to play video while in Microsoft DirectDraw® exclusive full-screen mode. For an example, see the DDrawXcl sample in the Samples\Multimedia\DShow\src\DDrawXcl subdirectory. The new <B>IDDrawExclModeVideoCallback</B> interface was added to enable applications to get synchronous notification about changes to the overlay position, size, visibility, and so on, so that the application can adjust its video visibility, size, and position.

<P><B>New DirectSound Interfaces</B>
<P>Two new Microsoft DirectSound® interfaces have been added: <B>IDirectSound3DBuffer</B> and <B>IDirectSound3DListener</B>. In addition, the <B>IAMDirectSound</B> interface has changed and can now be used to determine whether sounds played by the filter should always be heard, or only when the application is in focus. 

<P><B>Support for Dynamic Audio Format Changes</B>
<P>The previous release of DirectShow provided support for an audio format change only if it occurred on the first sample delivered. This restriction has been removed and audio format changes are now supported by the audio renderer filters at any time during playback. Additionally, this release fixes a problem where, for filter graphs that didn't provide audio data at the start of the run (for example, DVD and capture), a format change on the first sample caused audio to stop when the DSound Audio Renderer filter was used.

<P><B>Changed Handling of Noncontinuous Audio Data</B>
<P>In previous versions of DirectShow, when a time gap occurred in audio data, generally this gap would be ignored because the audio renderer filter would continue the clock on the arrival of the first time stamp after the gap and cause a jump in the reference clock used by all filters for synchronization. In this release, this behavior has been fixed for the DSound Audio Renderer filter. This filter now compares the time stamp at the beginning of a new sample with the time for the end of the previous sample and will attempt to fill the gap with audio silence and thus avoid causing jumps in the reference clock time. 

<P><B>New Samples</B>
<P><p>This version of DirectShow includes the following new samples: the DDrawXcl sample, which demonstrates how to play video while in Microsoft DirectDraw® exclusive full-screen mode; the WAVDest sample, which illustrates how to make a filter (WavDest.ax) that works in conjunction with the File Writer filter to write audio streams to WAV files; and the Mult sample, which demonstrates how to use the MultiFile Source Filter.

<h3><a name="Building the Samples"><strong>Building the Samples</strong></a></h3>

<p>To build the DirectShow SDK samples, you must install Microsoft Visual C++® version 5.0 or later. The header files and libraries from the DirectX media SDK are also required.

<p>To build all the samples, run nmake in the samples\multimedia\dshow\src directory. Debug versions will be built by default. To produce non-debug versions set the 'nodebug' environment variable (that is, set nodebug=1), or type nmake NODEBUG=1. Most samples include Microsoft Visual C++ x86 project files as well.

<p>Most features of DirectX media are compatible with DirectX foundation version 3.0 and higher. By default the ddraw.h header file from the DirectX foundation SDK is marked with DirectX version 6.0 compatibility. If you want to build your application using the DirectX 6.0 foundation SDK and be compatible with an older DirectDraw run-time then define DIRECTDRAW_VERSION to be the earliest version of DirectDraw with which you want to be compatible. For example if you want your application to run on the DirectX 3 run-time then define DIRECTDRAW_VERSION to be 0x0300 in ddraw.h.

<h3><a name="Requirements"><strong>Requirements</strong></a></h3>

<ul>
	<li>The DirectX media SDK, including DirectShow, requires at least Windows 95 or Windows NT® 4.0 service pack 3.
	<li>Setup requires the user be logged on as an 
    administrator when run on Windows NT.</li>              
</ul>

<p>The system must normally be restarted after installing the DirectX media run time and before playing any multimedia content. See the Redistribution Information section (help\ds\Oview\redist.htm) of the DirectX Media SDK documentation for information about 
installing the DirectX media run time from an application, detecting if a reboot is required, and turning on the run time's user interface.

<h3><a name="Redistribution"><strong>Redistribution</strong></a></h3>

<p>The DirectX Media Software Development Kit (SDK) contains seven different redistributable packages under the Redist directory. Six of the packages are designed specifically for redistribution of the Windows® Media Player. The remaining package is the Microsoft DirectX® Media redistributable package.

<p><b>Which Package Should I Use?</b>

<p>The package you should use depends on your application's needs. If your application is focused on streamed media such as ASF and RA formats, then one of the Windows® Media Player packages will work best. If your application is focused on DVD or Capture, then the DirectX Media run time would be more ideal. For more information on the Windows Media Player redistribution package, please see Microsoft® Windows® Media Player Redistribution Information.

<p><b>DirectX Media Redistribution Information </b>

<p>The Microsoft® DirectX® Media Software Development Kit (SDK) includes a redistributable package under the Redist directory. The Microsoft DirectX® Media redistributable package is Dxmedia.exe. Please note: the Microsoft DirectX® Media redistributable package no longer takes over extensions. The runtime has been changed such that AVI, WAV, and all other file types will not be taken over by the Windows® Media Player. If you would prefer the Windows® Media Player to take over the extensions for playback, you will also need to install one of the Windows® Media Player packages.

<h3><a name="Dvdrgn"><strong>DVD Region Update Tool, Dvdrgn.exe</strong></a></h3>

<p>Dvdrgn.exe can be called by Dvdplay.exe (or a third-party program) to change the system DVD region setting. Dvdrgn.exe can be installed by copying the Dvdrgn.exe file out of the CABs into %windir%. This is usually done by the [DVDPlay] section of Motown.inf whenever Dvdplay.exe is installed. DVD player installation is in turn invoked by the following two lines in the installation section of the INF file that installs the DVD decoder (either software or hardware), for example, Microsoft's own DVD.INF:
<pre>
include=motown.inf
needs=DVDPlay
</pre>

<p>This is the official way to get the player and Dvdrgn.exe installed.

<p>No registry modifications are required for either Dvdrgn.exe or Dvdplay.exe to work, so it is possible to install either or both by simply extracting the executables out of the CABs. The only limitation to this method of installation is that the DVD Player item never gets created in the Add/Remove Programs list for Control Panel, which means you can't uninstall the player through Control Panel. When the player is installed the right way by invoking the [DVDPlay] section of Motown.inf, an Add/Remove item is automatically created for it.

<p>The Dvdrgn.exe application accepts exactly one command-line parameter representing the drive letter (either upper or lower case) of the drive whose region is to be changed. The drive letter must not be followed by a colon, however.  So "Dvdrgn.exe d" and "Dvdrgn.exe D" are both correct, but "Dvdrgn.exe d:" is not.

<p>Dvdrgn.exe's exit status is zero if the region was successfully changed, nonzero otherwise. For example, a nonzero value is returned in any of the following cases.
<UL>
<li>The drive letter does not refer to a DVD drive.
<li>The drive's current setting could not be obtained.
<li>The user clicked OK without changing the region.
<li>The user tried changing the region but clicked No or Cancel in response to a warning.
<li>The user clicked OK for every warning but the Set 
    Region IOCTL failed for some reason.</li>               
</UL>

<p>The following countries are missing from Dvdrgn.exe's list of countries.

<h3><a name="Known Issues"><strong>Known Issues</strong></a></h3>

<ul>
<li>Rewinding across a multiangle portion of a DVD disc
<p>Rewinding across a multiangle portion of a DVD disc does not work correctly. The current behavior is that the disc will begin playing when it rewinds to the beginning of a multiangle segment. In addition to discs that offer multiple camera angles for viewing, many Hollywood Pictures and Touchstone discs such as "The Rock" and "Ransom" use multiangle segments to localize on-screen text and will thus exhibit this behavior when rewinding.
<P></P>
<li>YUV flipping
<p>When using certain video display cards with the Microsoft Media Player, various redraw problems can occur when the Media Player is playing a clip. The problem can manifest itself as blocks on the images, as purple or green streaks across the images, or as jittery motion. To correct this problem, change the YUV flipping property on the Media Player property pages using the following procedure: 
<ol>
<li>On the player, click Properties on the File menu. 
<li>On the Properties sheet, click the Advanced tab. 
<li>On the Advanced tab, select Video Renderer from the Filters in use box, and click Properties. 
<li>On the Filter Properties sheet, click the DirectDraw tab. 
<li>Clear the YUV Flipping check box, click OK, and 
      then close the Properties sheets.</li>              
</ol>   

<p></p>
<li>Oleaut32 error

<p>You might receive an oleaut32.dll error on OSR2 in 
    the Intel Indeo 5 portion of setup. Upgrading to Internet Explorer 4.0 or 
    installing the latest Indeo 5 codecs 
    (http://developer.intel.com/ial/indeo/video/driver.htm) and then 
    re-installing the DirectX media run-time should eliminate the error.</p></li>
