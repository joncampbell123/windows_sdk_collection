LICENSE AGREEMENT

THIS IS A LEGAL AGREEMENT between you and Viewpoint DataLabs International, Inc. ("Company").  If you do not agree to the terms and conditions of this License Agreement, select the button marked "Cancel" below.  If you proceed to download any of the 3D Models and/or Datasets (the "Models") you have selected, you thereby signify that you have agreed to all of the terms and conditions set forth below.

The Models are protected by United States copyright laws, international treaty provisions, and other laws.  You may not use, copy, display, modify or distribute the Models except in strict accordance with this License Agreement.

Company hereby grants to you the following Limited License with respect to the Models:

You may install the Models on an unlimited number of computers provided that all such computers are all located on your premises located at a single specific street address (or its equivalent). You may use and access the Models only at that one location and only as follows: You may use, copy and modify the Models in the creation of animations, renderings and applications which may require runtime access to the Models. You may include the Models as a component of a software application provided that: (a) the Models are not a significant component of the value of such software application; and (b) the Models are not sold or distributed separately from the software application; and (c) such software application contains a license agreement restricting translation and conversion of the models out of Microsoft DirectX format; and (d) such software application license agreement restricts further redistribution of the Models; and (e) such software application license agreement includes 'MODELS (c) COPYRIGHT 1998 VIEWPOINT DATALABS INTERNATIONAL, INC.'

You may not translate or otherwise convert the Models to any format other than the format in which they are provided (Microsoft's DirectX Media format.)

Subject to the foregoing limitations, you are free to copy and distribute your animations, renderings and software applications incorporating the Models.

All other rights with respect to the Models and their use are reserved to Company.

LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND WARRANTIES.  YOU ASSUME THE ENTIRE COST OF ANY DAMAGE RESULTING FROM YOUR USE OF EXPOLITATION OF THE MODELS.  YOU ASSUME ALL RESPONSIBILITIES FOR SELECTION OF THE MODELS TO ACHIEVE YOUR INTENDED RESULTS, AND FOR THE INSTALLATION OF, USE OF, AND RESULTS OBTAINED FROM THE MODELS.

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, COMPANY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE WITH RESPECT TO THE MODELS AND ANY ACCOMPANYING SOFTWARE OR MATERIALS.

Some States do not allow limitations on implied warranties, so the above limitation may not apply to you.

NO LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL COMPANY OR ITS SUPPLIERS BY LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF BUSINESS INFORMATION, THIRD PARTY CLAIMS, OR OTHER LOSS) ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE MODELS OR FOR ANY OTHER REASON, EVEN IF COMPANY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  IN NO EVENT SHALL COMPANY'S TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ALL DAMAGES IN ANY ONE OR MORE CAUSES OF ACTION EXCEED THE AMOUNT, IF ANY, PAID BY YOU FOR THE MODELS.

Because some States do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, the above limitation may not apply to you.
