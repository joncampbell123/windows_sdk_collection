<b>Redistribution Information</b>

<p>The Microsoft&reg; DirectX&reg; media redistributable package is Dxmedia.exe. An application must register itself as a client of the redistributable package by running Dxmedia.exe with the <B>-NQ</B> switch, the <B>-id</B> switch, and a unique identifier for the application. The <B>-NQ</B> switch enables the user interface. This switch is optional, and if used, must come before the <B>-id</B> switch on the command line, and the letters "N" and "Q" must be capitalized. If the <B>-NQ</B> switch is not used, the installation is totally quiet, and no dialog boxes appear.
<P>An example is shown in the following command line.

<PRE>dxmedia.exe -NQ -id:identifier</PRE>

<P>The identifier should uniquely identify your application. The identifier can be the globally unique identifier (GUID) of your registered application or a unique string. You should not use a string such as &quot;game&quot;, but instead use a more distinctive string. For example:

<PRE>dxmedia.exe -NQ -id:myrocketgame</PRE>

<P> - or -

<PRE>dxmedia.exe -NQ -id:my_GUID</PRE>

<P>The <I>identifier</I> is required. If you only type &quot;Dxmedia.exe&quot; or only double-click on the Dxmedia.exe icon, nothing will be installed. 
 
<P>The same syntax is used for all platforms: Microsoft Windows&reg; 95, Microsoft Windows&reg; NT&reg; x86, and Windows NT Alpha. Note that each processor has its own executable (either an Alpha or an x86 version).

<P>If successful, the installation returns one of the following success codes.
<UL>
<LI>ERROR_SUCCESS&#151;installation was successful.
<LI>ERROR_SUCCESS_REBOOT_REQUIRED&#151;installation was successful, but changes will not be effective until the system is rebooted.
</UL>

<P>If unsuccessful, the installation returns an HRESULT describing the error; for example, E_FAIL or E_INVALIDARG.
 
<P>The installation is totally quiet, and no dialog boxes appear.

<P>The install/uninstall identifier does not need to be a GUID, but it must be unique. GUIDs are essentially guaranteed to be unique.

<p>The install package automatically handles different versions during installation. Files are only overwritten (after back up) if they use the same platform and are older than the files about to be installed. 

<p>An application can uninstall the DirectX media package it installed during its own installation by calling the uninstall executable Purgedxm.exe. Purgedxm.exe is included with the redistribution package. You can uninstall the DirectX media package by running Purgedxm.exe with the application identifier that was used during the installation, as shown in the following syntax.

<PRE>purgedxm.exe identifier</PRE>

<P><B>Note</B> Do not use the <B>-id</B> switch when uninstalling.

<p>The redistributable DirectX media run-time set up installs the DirectX media run-time components. It also installs a minimum version of DirectX foundation on x86 and Alpha platforms, as appropriate. The application can install DirectX foundation separately if the full installation is needed after the redistributable package has been installed.
