DirectMusic Producer DirectX7 

DirectMusic is a new DirectX technology.  Designed to provide a complete
music solution to web site designers and title developers, DirectMusic
provides the deepest and broadest music technology in existence today on any
platform.  By providing a framework for musical interactivity, DirectMusic
lets you build musical intelligence into multimedia titles for Windows. 

DirectMusic introduces technologies and file formats that have previously not
been available.  To allow composers to use the interactive and variable
resources of DirectMusic along with the consistent sound performance of DLS,
an authoring tool is included in this SDK.  This authoring tool is
DirectMusic Producer. 

Producer features a framework that is media agnostic.  Individual DirectMusic
file objects, such as styles, chordmaps, templates, and DLS files, are
supported by integrated editor modules that know how to communicate with each
other and work in synchrony with real time interactive editing on top of the
DirectMusic engine.

DirectMusic Producer consists of the following elements:
a. Framework: the environment which hosts all authoring components;
b. The Conductor component: acts as the liaison between authoring components
   and the DirectMusic engine;
c. Style Designer component: provides for creation of interactive music files;
d. Chordmap Designer component: chords and scales for interactive scenarios;
e. Band Editor component: assigning instrument settings (patch changes)
   including DLS;
f. Segment Designer component: allows for open ended creation of different track
   types to be integrated into musical phrases.  MIDI files and Styles can be
   imported into Segments and used together or independently.
h. DLS Designer component: for creation of Downloadable Sounds soundsets.

It is recommended that you uninstall any previous versions of DirectMusic
Producer if there are any present on your machine (Start/Settings/Control
Panel/Add Remove Programs).  It is recommended that you close Producer before
attempting to uninstall. 

Producer requires the DirectX7 version of DirectMusic, as Producer functionality 
is built entirely on top of DirectMusic. (The Producer installation process will 
prompt to install the DirectX7 runtime bits, if they are not already present.)  

DirectMusic Producer also requires IE4.0 (or higher).  You can uninstall IE
after installing, as IE updates some system files that are required for Producer.

A demo project will be installed at C:\My Documents\DMUSProducer\demo3 to
introduce some basic DirectMusic concepts.
