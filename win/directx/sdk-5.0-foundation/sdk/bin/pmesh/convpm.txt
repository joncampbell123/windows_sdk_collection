convpm
------

convpm converts a mesh contained in an X file to a Progressive Mesh.
The final progressive mesh will also be stored in an X file and can be
loaded into Direct3D Retained Mode using IDirect3DProgressiveMesh::Load.


How to use it
-------------

Copy the X file containing the mesh you want to convert into the directory
containing convpm. Then run:

convpm mesh

For example if the mesh you want to convert is stored in bigmesh.x run:

convpm bigmesh

The final Progressive mesh would be stored in bigmesh_pm.x


Troubleshooting
---------------

The conversion process can take a long time. For example bigship.x (755KB)
takes about 40 minutes to convert to a progressive mesh on a P166 with 
32MB of memory.

convpm echoes "." (at irregular intervals) as the file is being converted. 
The bigger the file the more dots and the longer you should expect to wait.

Before converting make sure you have plenty of free disk space. convpm uses
a lot of intermediate files during the conversion process and will fail if
you run out of disk space.
