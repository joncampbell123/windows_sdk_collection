     What we've tried to do for you here is to layout the ImagiNation / AOL 
     online games offerings, our plans for integrating DirectPlay, and the strengths 
     of our partners strategy - as well as answer any questions we think 
     you might be asking yourself right now. <BR><BR>
     
     If you're not asking yourself questions right now, but think of some later 
     that you want answers to, please contact us through our web site at  <a href="http://www.inngames.com">www.inngames.com</a>.</font>
