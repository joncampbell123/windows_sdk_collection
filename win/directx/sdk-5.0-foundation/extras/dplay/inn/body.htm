<P>Sure, we experienced the growing pains of operating our own proprietary
online network for a number of years - and we learned from that. However,
we are now singing the praises of partnering with established online services distributors
so that we can focus on what we love and do best - getting your games to
market. For game developers getting a game earlier to the market with a well established customer base can be very profitable. </P>

     <font size=+2><b>What is ImagiNation About?</B></font><BR><br>
    For developers, our primary goal is to provide and nurture dynamic online environments to suport great content. 
Next, we want to make it quick
     and easy (and lots of fun!) for game developers to develop content for 
     mass distribution by AOL and other online and Internet 
     Service Providers.

By working directly with Microsoft to integrate our proprietary SDK

     extensions with the popular DirectPlay platform, we are hoping to make

     life much easier for you, the developer. If you are already

     familiar with the Microsoft standards, you will soon be able to take 
     advantage of our (ImagiNation and AOL) value-added online games 
     features; such as tournament scoring, and virtual currency interfaces, without having to develop differently for 
     different platforms. Talk about a headache saver! </font>

Simply stated, we want to standardize the game development process as much as you do,

     which is why we are supporting DirectPlay,

     and sprinkling our technical expertise into the mix. </font>
