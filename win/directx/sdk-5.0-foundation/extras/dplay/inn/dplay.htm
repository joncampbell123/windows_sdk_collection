<TD width=49%><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=3> While we are extremely proud of our SDK (having received many accolades
for how thorough and easy it is to use), we realize that it is proprietary
and game developers won't use it until they have a deal with us. </TD>

<TD width=49%><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=3> We believe that as DirectPlay matures (with gentle prodding on our
part to ensure it has all the necessary features required for successful
multiplayer games) game developers will adopt it, and start programming
with it - and we want your great game running on AOL and the Internet just as much as you
do. </TD>

<TD><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=3> As DirectPlay evolves into an industry standard, ImagiNation/AOL will continue
to work directly with Microsoft to ensure that future versions of DirectPlay incorporate all the best multiplayer
features. The same features we already have in our proprietary SDK.</TD>

<TD><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=3> But our developers won't have to wait for those features to become
standard. We will be providing DirectPlay extensions which will enable
game developers to take advantage of our additional features without having
to re-write their base communication scheme. </TD>

<TD><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=3> We have created CyberPark and GameXpress (a code name) as game environments, 
which encourage online social activities and communities of
interest.</TD>

<TD><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=3> When you make your games &quot;lobbyable&quot;, your games will automatically
be available from our environments.</TD>

<TD><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=3> By doing this, members logging on to AOL to play games, can
meet others with similar interests, and suggest playing your game. </TD>

<TD><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=3> Our experience proves that the best opponent is a human opponent. Games
with human competition and interaction have much more longevity, and a
stronger following. 
<P>By using DirectPlay, you do not have to worry about any proprietary
details until you are ready to fold your game into The ImagiNation Network
realm. When you're ready to enhance your game with our features and functionality,
all you need to do is add proprietary extensions. </P>

<P>This is especially useful for things like tournaments, creating customized
personas, and chat features that enhance social interaction.</P>
</TD>

<TD><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=3> And there's no need to worry that, after inserting our proprietary
extensions, your game won't run anymore under a non-ImagiNation Network
environment. It will work fine. Your gamers just won't be able to enjoy the features that load with
our extensions. </P>

<P>The bottom line is revenue. Once a game is created with DirectPlay,
a game developer can work out a deal with a Service Provider (such as The
ImagiNation Network) to pay royalties for every hour played on their system.
Considering that AOL currently has eight million members, well you do the
math. </P>
