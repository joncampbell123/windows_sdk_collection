both the server and the client.

Quick client instructions:

1. Under the Profiles menu, click on Select.  Here you will create a profile
   for yourself. Either edit the one that is already there or create a new
   one. Enter as much information about yourself as you like.

2. Under the Profiles menu (again), click on Select and select the profile
   you just created.

3. Under the Login menu, click "Select Game Room". For "Game Room Name"
   choose "Your DirectX Trial Server".  For the Internet address, you will
   need to enter the IP address of the machine that is running the server.
   The IP address is displayed in the title bar of the server application.
   Fill in bogus account and password. Click Logon.

   The next you want to logon, you just have to pick the server and profile
   from under the Login menu.

In the client display, other people will be represented as squares.
