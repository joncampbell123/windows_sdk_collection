The PalaceLobby(TM)
======================

The Palace, Inc. introduces its new PalaceLobby 
feature which enables the gaming community to easily 
and affordably create graphical game lobbies. 

The PalaceLobby feature is the only non-proprietary 
tool that allows you to host a DirectPlay-enabled, 
graphical meeting place for multi-player Internet 
gaming.  In other words, players can now interact with 
each other before and after playing games online.

With the PalaceLobby, you can seamlessly link to any 
multi-player game supporting Microsoft’s DirectPlay 
lobby API.

Installing and using the PalaceLobby feature
============================================

To install the Palace software necessary to trying out 
the PalaceLobby features:

1. Run the SETUP.EXE program.  This will install a 
Palace server capable of handling five simultaneous 
connections (to permit more connections, you'll need to 
register your software). It also installs a Palace 
client that you can use to connect to the Palace 
server.

2. Start the Palace Server (PSERVER32.EXE). This server 
is a sample Palace site that includes a PalaceLobby 
room.

3. Start the Palace Client (PALACE32.EXE) and connect 
to your Palace server. To do this,  you'll need to know 
the IP address or hostname of  your computer.  Specify 
this in the client's connection dialog for the Server 
Address.  The Port number is 9998.

At this point, you can visit the rooms in your Palace 
and test the PalaceLobby feature.

NOTE: The server (PSERVER32.EXE) and client 
(PALACE32.EXE) you install from this CD are special 
versions that support the PalaceLobby feature. If you 
visit our web site and are tempted to download "newer" 
versions of these files, make sure they include 
PalaceLobby support. If you don't see indication that 
PalaceLobby support is included, place the new files in 
a separate directory. 

How to test your DirectPlay Lobbyable game with PalaceLobby
===========================================================

You can plug your own game into PalaceLobby for testing
purposes by editing the file PSERVER.DAT.  Search for the
following lines (there are two instances, one for each 
game spot in the Duel room):

"Duel"  SETSPOTGAMENAME
"33925241-05F8-11D0-8063-00A0C90AE891" SETSPOTGAMEGUID

Replace the items in quotes with your own game name, and 
the DirectPlay GUID for your game.  This won't change the
room graphics for the Duel room, but it will launch
your game.

Where to find additional documentation
======================================

Running SETUP.EXE installs a file called MANUAL.PDF 
into your Palace directory.  This file (in Acrobat 
format) describes the iptScrae language additions that 
are needed to include PalaceLobby support.

The standard client, server, and iptScrae documentation 
are not included in this install. To get this 
information, connect to our web site at:
