DSShow3D -- DirectSound3D Sample
================================

This program is an improved version of the DirectSound Show (DSSHOW) sample
that shipped in previous DirectX SDKs.  It features a more compact interface,
support for 3D sounds and new buffer options, the ability to open countless
sounds (i.e. more than 8, which was dsshow's limit), and a new UI that takes
advantage of your entire desktop for placing (or minimizing) windows.
