Getting around is easy in CyberPark. Just point and click, and your
3-D custom body "walks" where you want to go. In a hurry? Teleport
yourself anywhere in the park. Or take some time to snoop around
behind the scenes. Beneath CyberPark's plaza floors dwell twisting
corridors and secret doors that lead to undiscovered treasures.
<P>
Plus, the park remembers where you like to go. That may be the Casino
for card sharks, the Games Parlor for the Bridge Club, or the Space
Port for Cyber Punks. Role-players like to roam the Castle, brushing
shoulders with the bards and minstrels, while sportsmen head for the
Big Game Lodge.

CyberPark is the only online community that lets you create your own
body and virtually "walk around" as you explore the park. Take a
quick visit to the Body Boutique where you can select gender, body
type, hair color and style, skin tone, facial shape and other
features to show who you really are, or who you want to be!

<td><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=3> You can dress for any occasion, with thousands of clothing
combinations available. Pick out a fishing jacket for your bass fishing tour on the lake.
Or, if you're headed for the casino, choose an elegant evening dress that
swings and sways realistically as you walk. Eventually, you'll be
able to choose your style of movement, from manly swaggers to mincing
steps.

Don't hold back, express
yourself with dozens of special sound effects you customize by volume
and pitch. Or relax by the fountain and listen to the rushing water
and dolphins nearby.

<P>

Making friends is as easy as taking a stroll through the park. Cyber
Park's visual acoustic lets you "see" what everyone's talking about
and even join in the conversation. IMAGINATION's sound technology allows music and
environmental noises like water and chirping birds to be heard as you
move through the park.

<br>When you play in CyberPark, you go head-to-head with real people from all
across the country in lots of <a href="games.htm">action-packed games.</a>

<p>
Before your match, you can shoot the breeze with your friends in
some pretty fantastic hangouts. So go ahead, rent a boat at the Big
Game Lodge, dance the night away at The Zone,
or simply have a seat at a Smart Table in
the Game Parlor, Casino, or Sidewalk Cafe, and play a wImagiNationing hand in
games like Gin, Spades, Hearts and Poker. The game launches
automatically when you sit down at the table.
