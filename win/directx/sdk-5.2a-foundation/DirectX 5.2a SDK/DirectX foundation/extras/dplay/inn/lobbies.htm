<TD><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=3> ImagiNation currently supports two gameplaying environments which will
act as DirectPlay lobbies, CyberPark and GameXpress (code name). Both
of these environments encourage and support online social activities and
the development of communities of interest.</TD>

<TD><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=3> As you can probably tell, we are big cheerleaders for social interaction
centered around gameplay. Within both of these environments, it is not
uncommon for fan clubs, bulletin boards, or special-interest groups to
form around specific game content - which all adds up to a very loyal following
of your online title!</TD>
