We have two first-class game environments (CyberPark and GameXpress).
Both will be available via America Online, as well as other online and
Internet Service Providers. That means the potential of converting at least
eight million members to becoming devoted players of your games. </td>

suited to your DirectPlay game), customize a variety of games with their
preferred options (number of players, special or standard rules, easy or
difficult play, etc.), and/or convert others to Join or Watch their game.
All before the game even launches, and all from within our game environments
(for example: CyberPark).</TD>

and socializing with others, they may choose online multiplayer entertainment.
They will be presented with a list of Service Providers to choose from.
CyberPark on AOL will be one of these choices. Choosing this option logs
them into AOL, and then into CyberPark, where they will find hundreds of
other players interested in playing the same game.  </td></tr></table><br></center><br>

<TD><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=3> The ImagiNation Network has been developing successful, online multiplayer
games for more than six years. Our back-end server complex is extremely
robust and full featured. <BR>
<BR>
We currently have a proprietary SDK stuffed with multiplayer features that
drive players to play longer and keep coming back for more. <BR>
</TD>

<TD><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=3> We are also working directly with Microsoft (and their DirectPlay team)
to incorporate some of our additional features into future versions of
Direct Play. <BR>
<br>
Until our features become industry standards, we have created additional
APIs that smoothly and effortlessly interface with DirectPlay. Our DirectPlay
extensions will take advantage of many of our additional capabilities,
enhancing your DirectPlay games for an ever-enlarging audience.</TD>
