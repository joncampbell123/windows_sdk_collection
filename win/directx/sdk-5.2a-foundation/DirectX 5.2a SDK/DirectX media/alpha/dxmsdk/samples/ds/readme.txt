--------------------------------------------------

For full details of the samples see DirectX media documentation.

BUILDING THE SAMPLES

To build all the samples run nmake in the samples
subdirectory.  Or you can build them individually
by invoking nmake in the appropriate directory.

The samples are built debug by default.  If you want
to build them retail you must either pass nodebug=1
to nmake or set nodebug=1 in your build environment.

To clean the build tree, make the clean target.  To
rebuild the tree use "nmake clean all".
