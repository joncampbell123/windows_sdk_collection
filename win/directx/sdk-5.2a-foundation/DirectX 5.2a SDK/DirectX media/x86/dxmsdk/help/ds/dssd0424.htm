<DL><A NAME="gloss_00010b0112000001"></A><DT><B>reference clock
 </B></DT><DD>An object that provides a clock and supports the scheduling of events according to time as counted by that clock. Any reference clock must support the <A HREF="dssd0177.htm" TARGET="TEXT">IReferenceClock</A> interface. The time of the clock can be obtained by calling the <A HREF="dssd0177.htm#If_0001060154030300" TARGET="TEXT">IReferenceClock::GetTime</A> method. The time returned by <B>GetTime</B> is defined as a <A HREF="dssd0177.htm#If_0001060154030301" TARGET="TEXT">REFERENCE_TIME</A> type and loosely represents the number of 100-nanosecond units that have elapsed since some fixed start time. The return value should generally increase at a rate of approximately one per 100 nanoseconds. In exceptional circumstances, the clock can stop for a time. (This will suspend any filter that was using the clock as a sync source.) The clock can also jump forward in exceptional circumstances.

</DD><A NAME="gloss_00010b0112000002"></A><DT><B>reference time
 </B></DT><DD>An absolute time established by a <A HREF="dssd0424.htm#gloss_00010b0112000001" TARGET="TEXT">reference clock</A> in the filter graph. It refers to some time value outside the filter graph (for example, perhaps the time since Windows&#174; was started). The reference time can be obtained by calling the <A HREF="dssd0177.htm#If_0001060154030300" TARGET="TEXT">IReferenceClock::GetTime</A> method. The time returned is defined as a <A HREF="dssd0177.htm#If_0001060154030301" TARGET="TEXT">REFERENCE_TIME</A> type and loosely represents the number of 100-nanosecond units that have elapsed since some fixed start time. Note that the reference time does not have to bear any permanent relationship to a real time. It can drift, it can drift at a changing rate, and it need not correct for such drift. In particular, it does not have to represent a count of the number of 100 nanoseconds that have passed since some arbitrary time in the past. See <A CLASS=TCTOP HREF="dssd0062.htm" TARGET="TEXT">Understanding Time and Clocks in DirectShow</A> for more information.
