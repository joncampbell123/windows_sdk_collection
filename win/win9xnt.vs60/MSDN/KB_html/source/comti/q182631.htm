<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how to create a recording file that is capable of
capturing from a target Remote Environment (RE) which specifies a code page
that differs from the local machine default.
<P>
When a diagnostic capture RE is created using the COMTI Management Console,
an associated recording file is created. The code page assigned to the
recording file is the local default selected during Windows NT Server
installation. If you attempt to select a target RE on the Target property
sheet that has a different code page, the following error message appears:
<P>
<PRE>   (8022) The selected target Remote Environment uses a locale or code
   page which is incompatible with the locale settings of the currently
   selected recording file.

   You may either modify the locale settings for the selected target
   Remote Environment or identify a different recording file.

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Diagnostic Capture RE's created with the COMTI Management Console are
assigned an Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code (EBCDIC) code
page appropriate for the current Windows NT Server system locale setting.
To change this assignment, you must create a new recording file with the
preferred code page.
<P>
To modify a Diagnostic Capture RE so that it is capable of capturing from a
Target RE with a different code page, use the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Move any components that are currently assigned to the Diagnostic
   Capture RE to another RE.

<P><LI>Right-click the Remote Environment and select Properties.

<P><LI>Click the Recording tab, and enter a new recording name in the Name
   field of the Recording selection group box.

<P><LI>Click Browse and then click Open. Only the Type field should now be
   populated in the Recording information group box. The remaining fields
   should be empty.

<P><LI>Click the Target tab and then click "Use responses from the following
   Remote Environment."

<P><LI>Select the target RE you want to capture from. Click Apply to create the
   new recording file. It will have the same code page as that of the
   Target RE.

<P><LI>Click the Local tab and view the Code page entry to verify.
<P>
</OL>To modify a Diagnostic Capture RE so that it has a specific code page, use
the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Move any components that are currently assigned to the Diagnostic
   Capture RE to another RE.

<P><LI>Right-click the RE and select Properties.

<P><LI>Click the Recording tab and enter a new recording name in the Name field
   under Recording Selection. The remaining fields should be empty.

<P><LI>Click the Target tab and then click "Use responses from the turnaround
   dialog."

<P><LI>Click the Local tab and select the preferred code page.

<P><LI>Click Apply to create the new recording file with the preferred code
   page. If you return to the Target tab and choose to capture from a
   target RE, its code page must match that of the new recording file or
   the Apply will fail.
