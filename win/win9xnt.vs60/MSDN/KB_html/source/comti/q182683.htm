The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft COM Transaction Integrator for CICS and IMS version 1.0
   included with SNA Server version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After starting the Import COBOL Wizard, it may become impossible to view or
select the Windows taskbar. This problem occurs after browsing to select
the import file. When this problem occurs, the taskbar will not be
available until the Import COBOL Wizard has finished running. This problem
occurs if both of the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>The taskbar has been set to "Auto hide" mode.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>While the taskbar is hidden, the window for Component Builder (CB),
   which is used to create an IMS typelib, has been resized to cover the
   entire monitor screen area, although not actually maximized.
<P>
</UL><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, resize the CB window so that at least a very
small portion of the background window is visible. After doing this, the
problem will not occur while using the Import COBOL Wizard.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft COM Transaction
Integrator for CICS and IMS version 1.0.
A supported fix is now available for SNA Server version 4.0, but has not
been fully regression-tested and should be applied only to systems
experiencing this specific problem. Unless you are severely impacted by
this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next
Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft Technical Support
for more information.
