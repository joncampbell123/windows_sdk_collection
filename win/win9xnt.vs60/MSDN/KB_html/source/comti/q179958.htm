The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft COM Transaction Integrator for CICS and IMS 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Already Verified Authentication option is specified on the Security tab
of the COM Transaction Integrator (COMTI) Remote Environment (RE)
Properties dialog box.
<P>
Under certain circumstances when you select that option, only a user ID is
sent to the mainframe; no password is sent. The mainframe determines that
this user ID has already been authenticated and does not require a
password. This is possible when COMTI uses Microsoft Transaction Server
(MTS) package credentials or Windows NT user credentials for
authentication.
<P>
However, if the COMTI security override is being used instead, the
transport always insists on having both the user ID and the password. Both
are sent to the host. If the Already Verified Authentication indicator is
set on the RE, it is ignored in this case.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Rationale for Using "Already Verified Authentication"</h3>
 
<P>
When using integrated host security with MTS package credentials or
Windows NT user credentials, mainframe credentials cannot be ascertained by
COMTI or the client application.
<P>
COMTI and SNA Server act as a trusted entity, verifying the user's identity
first. Therefore, there is no need to send a password to the mainframe,
which would waste more cycles to check it on the mainframe side.
<P>
Rationale for Ignoring "Already Verified Authentication" When Using COMTI
Security Override
 
<P>
In this case, COMTI has direct access to the mainframe credentials. If
COMTI would send only the user ID, an application could easily guess at one
or another user ID, because user IDs are similar in most installations.
Without having to know a password, the application could do things on the
mainframe using the pilfered user ID.
<P>
Identify security (ATTACHSEC=IDENTIFY in the CICS Connection definition)
implies that the local logical unit (LU) on the computer has already
verified the identity of the user, so the host can trust you. However, in
the case of the application override, that is not true; COMTI is unable to
determine who the user is.
