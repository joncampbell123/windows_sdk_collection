The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft COM Transaction Integrator for CICS and IMS version 1.0
   included with SNA Server version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
COMTI state machines are not reused if an application method invocation
fails before a connection is established. A memory leak can be observed by
the use of monitoring techniques. Memory used by Mtx.exe grows by about
6 kilobytes PER METHOD invocation.
<P>
NOTE: This leak only happens on transactional calls.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This memory leak can occur when a COMTI application is in the midst of a
transaction and there is something wrong with its Remote Environment (RE)
configuration or the RE is inactive. You can correct the RE while the
transaction is in-flight and go ahead with repetitive method invocations
within the same Transaction Server process. Meanwhile, COMTI state machines
have been allocated for the unsuccessful method invocations that occurred
before the RE was corrected. These unusable state machines are left intact,
using memory and being examined and rejected on each method invocation. So,
there is more processing overhead incurred in addition to the memory leak.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Correct the erroneous RE and stop/start all Microsoft Transaction Server
server processes.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft COM Transaction
Integrator for CICS and IMS version 1.0.
A supported fix is now available for SNA Server version 4.0, but has not
been fully regression-tested and should be applied only to systems
experiencing this specific problem. Unless you are severely impacted by
this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next
Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft Technical Support
for more information.
