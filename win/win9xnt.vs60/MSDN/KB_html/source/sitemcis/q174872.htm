The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Commercial Internet System version 1.0
   - Microsoft Replication System (CRS)

<LI>Microsoft Site Server version 2.0
   - Microsoft Replication System (CRS)
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Content Replication System (CRS) can fail to properly replicate if there is
a network error or the destination file is locked. The Windows NT
Application Event Log will show an Error ID 15060. The CRS log will show
this warning:
<P>
<PRE>   TransmitFile failed on file * of size x The network session timed out on
   a receive or send operation.

</PRE>The Windows NT Application Event Log will show an Error Id 15119. The CRS
log will show this warning:
<P>
<PRE>   Moving *.FIL to *, File *.FIL was found but an error was returned anyway
   The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another
   process.

</PRE>This will only happen when CRS is configured to use Transaction Mode and
the size of the file is less than 64 KB.
<P>
WORKAROUND
 
<P>
To work around this problem:

<UL><LI>Do not use Frame Mode. This mode was designed for use on unreliable WAN
   links. If all the servers participating in a project are connected by a
   LAN, then you should use the /fastmode flag when creating the project.
   This can also be done in the Web-based CRS Administration in the Project
   Options page. You need to select the checkbox "Turn off framing for
   local replications".
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Commercial
Internet System, version 1.0 Service Pack 1 (SP1) and Microsoft Site Server
version 2.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service
Pack for Microsoft Site Server 2.0. For information on obtaining the
Service Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
(without the spaces):

</PRE>MORE INFORMATION
 
<P>
CRS will attempt to retry when there is a network error or the destination
file is locked. In the case the destination file is locked, CRS will retry
at five-second intervals a total of 10 times. One minute has been shown to
be sufficient interval for most Web servers.
