The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Commercial Internet System, version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
A user in the chatroom may appear with the nickname "ICxxxx:xx," where
xxxx:xx are numeric characters. The user who logged on never created this
nickname.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
An identical nickname was found in the Chat network, forcing Chat Server to
assign a unique nickname.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following example illustrates the problem:
<P>
Suppose you have three Chat Servers in a star topology in which you have
one server acting as a master and two slave servers that uplink to the
master.
<P>
When the master server is down, the Chat Server network is split into two
separate networks. During that time, each slave server allows identical
nicknames to exist in the same chatroom, because the two slave servers do
not communicate through the portal anymore.
<P>
When the master server comes back, the portal connection is reestablished
between those three servers, and the network split is resolved. However,
there are now identical nicknames in the same chatroom. Chat Server
resolves the collision by assigning a unique nickname of ICxxxx:xx.
<P>
It is also possible that Chat Server creates this nickname if the client
does not provide the nickname when it logs on. Comic Chat and Michat do not
allow a NULL nickname, but other types of clients may.
