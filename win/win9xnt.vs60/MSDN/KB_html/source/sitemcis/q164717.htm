<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The server may crash intermittently when users disconnect abnormally. An
access violation may occur frequently during query and infrequently during
channel join operations. This happens because the user who is performing
the operation is disconnected. The user object gets released and is then
written to by the thread processing the query or join.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
The Chatsvc.dll file has been modified to correct the problem of the user
object being incorrectly deleted during clean up of a socket close. Upgrade
with Service Pack 1 (SP1) for MCIS v1.0.  This will update the Chatsvc.dll
file, and correct the problem.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Commercial
Internet System, version 1.0.
We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
