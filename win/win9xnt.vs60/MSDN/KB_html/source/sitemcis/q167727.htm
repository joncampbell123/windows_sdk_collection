The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Commercial Internet System, version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
An access violation in the Content Replication System (CRS) may occur when
a route contains more than 300 characters.
<P>
The following example demonstrates the behavior:

<OL><P><LI>Create a route with 31 destinations. Make the machine names at
   least 10 characters long so that more than 300 total characters
   are included in the route.

<P><LI>Create a project that uses the route created in step 1.

<P><LI>Start the project.

<P><LI>An access violation occurs in CRS when the project starts.
<P>
</OL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
CRS uses a hard-coded maximum route size of 300 characters.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Crsdll.dll was modified to allow creation of routes with more than 300
characters, however the CRS interface cannot be used to add servers for
large routes due to limits of the interface.
<P>
To add servers for large routes, you must edit the registry manually using
the following steps.
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them.
Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of
Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

<OL><P><LI>Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

<P><LI>Go to the following key in the registry:
<P>
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\CRS\Routes

<P><LI>Locate the key that describes the route that you need to edit.
   The route may be similar to the following:
<P>
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\CRS\Routes\My Route

<P><LI>Edit the Value Destinations:REG_MULTI_SZ:.

<P><LI>Enter the additional server names in the Multi-String Editor, pressing
   ENTER after you add each name.

<P><LI>When you have added all the server names, click OK.

<P><LI>Exit Registry Editor.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Commercial
Internet System version 1.0.
A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-
tested and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific
problem. Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem,
Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains
this fix. Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
