The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Commercial Internet System, version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After you install the Internet News Service (INS) on a Windows NT server,
if you run Setup again to add another INS feature and then attempt to
uninstall INS sometime in the future, only the features that were added
during the last Setup will be removed by the program.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Internet News Server creates a new uninstall script every time Setup is
run. Only the options selected during the most recent setup are recorded;
therefore, they are the only ones removed by the uninstall process
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To ensure that all INS components are completely removed by the
uninstall program:

<UL><LI>Always uninstall INS completely before attempting to add any new
   features, and then reinstall from scratch.
<P>
</UL>-or-

<UL><LI>Run Setup, select all options, and then uninstall INS.
<P>
</UL>If you have already added features and attempted to uninstall with no
success, you can manually clean out the directory, registry keys, and so
forth. The better solution is to do a full install and then uninstall INS to ensure everything is removed properly.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Commercial Internet System
INS version 1.0. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
