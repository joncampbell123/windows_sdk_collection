The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Microsoft Site Server version 2.0
<PRE>  - Microsoft Site Analyst
</PRE> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Site Analyst does not return an error when you copy a site to a non-
writeable media.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Redirect the copy to a writeable media.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
You can use the Copy Site option to copy a site from a Web server to your
local hard disk as Microsoft Site Analyst builds the map. Select the Copy
Site check box, then enter (or browse for) the directory name in the Local
Site Root Directory text box. Then click OK.
<P>
Note: Be sure to select Ignore Default WebMap on the General tab. If you do
not select this option and there is a default WebMap on the site, Microsoft
Site Analyst will not copy all the files you expect it to copy.
<P>
Site copies are useful for a variety of reasons. Perhaps you are setting up
a mirrored site in order to split incoming requests between multiple
servers. Or perhaps you are getting ready to create a master CD of your
site. There may also be times when someone needs to work with your site on
a portable computer (for example, a sales representative on the road), and
that's easy to do when you have copied a site locally. In addition, working
with a site locally is much faster than on the Web, because you do not have
to deal with server traffic and long load times.
If you try to copy a site to a directory that already contains one or more
files, Microsoft Site Analyst displays a warning message. You can still
copy the site to this directory (by clicking OK in the message box), but
some files might be overwritten if they have the same name. It is a good
idea to store your site copies in separate directories, one for each site
you map. Otherwise, you could end up with a jumble of files from several
different sites in the same directory.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Site Analyst, a component
of Microsoft Site Server version 2.0. We are researching this problem and
will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
