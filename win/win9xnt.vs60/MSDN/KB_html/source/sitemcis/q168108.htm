The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Commercial Internet System, version 1.0
</UL>

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The Internet Mail Server (IMS) may process mail slowly resulting in a
backup of mail in the mail queue as well as in the pickup directories. The
queue directory will contain a large number of .rtr files which indicates
that multiple Domain Name Service (DNS) retries have occurred.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Excessive DNS query failures cause mail processing to perform slowly
because IMS continually attempts to resolve the names against the DNS. The
DNS lookup attempts use a critical section to ensure mutual exclusion when
running the DNS lookup code. This causes all other queue processing that
requires DNS resolution to stop until the current DNS lookup is complete.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Smtpsvc.dll was modified to resolve contributing issues with the handling
of DNS MX lookups, and the handling of DNS lookup retries.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Commercial
Internet System version 1.0.
A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-
tested and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific
problem. Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem,
Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains
this fix. Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
