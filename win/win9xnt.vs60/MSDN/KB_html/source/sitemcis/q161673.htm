The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Commercial Internet Server version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you send a message of approximately 4,000 bytes to a user on MCIS Mail
Server whose mail is forwarded to another server, the mail message is
received and immediately forwarded to the other computer. The bytes
received total equals 4,600; however, the bytes sent total equals 422.
<P>
Bytes sent should be slightly larger than bytes received (because of the
additional information appended to the header).
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in MCIS version 1.0. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
