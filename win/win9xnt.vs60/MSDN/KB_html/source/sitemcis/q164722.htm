<UL><LI>Microsoft Commercial Internet System, version 1.0

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When browsing a web site that uses case sensitive file names for file
access, the content replication system (CRS) may fail to replicate files.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
CRS maintains a lookup table for each URL that it is supposed to pull to
determine if the pull transaction has been completed. CRS does not maintain
the case sensitivity of the URL when placing the name for the URL in this
table. This causes the replication of the file to fail on web servers that
use case sensitive file names for file access.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
A fix to this bug is included with Service Pack 1 (SP1). With the fix, CRS
maintains the case sensitivity of the file names for the URL when building
its lookup table. However, CRS still does not differentiate files in its
lookup table using case sensitivity. Therefore it will only enter one file
in its lookup table in cases where multiple files of the same name are
differentiated only through case sensitivity. The first file that is
referenced during the session will be replicated.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Commercial
Internet System, version 1.0.
We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
