The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Collaboration Data Objects (CDO), versions 1.1, 1.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article provides sample code demonstrating how to create a Visual
Basic based Messaging application using Collaboration Data Objects
(previously named Active Messaging) that runs as a service under Windows NT
version 4.0.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This application is dependent on the Collaboration Data Objects (CDO)
library being referenced by the Visual Basic project.
Since this application is being built with the intent to run as a service,
it is built in a code module (not a form). In addition, you should select
the Unattended Execution check box on the General tab of the Project
Properties dialog box. Selecting this check box indicates that the project
is intended to run without user interaction. Unattended projects have no
interface elements. Any run time functions like messages that normally
result in user interaction are written to an event log.
<P>
This article is divided into three primary sections:

<UL><LI>Method 1: How to write a Visual Basic CDO Application that can be run
   from the Windows NT Schedule Service.

<LI>Method 2: How to write a Visual Basic CDO Application that can be run
   from the Windows NT Schedule Service indirectly using the SU utility
   from the Windows NT Resource Kit.

<LI>Method 3: How to write and register as a Service a Visual Basic
   Application that uses CDO.
<P>
</UL><h3>Method 1</h3>
 
<P>
Paste the following code into a new BAS Module. Make sure that the
Collaboration Data Objects (CDO) library is currently referenced by the
project. Build the executable and follow the directions in the code
comments below:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub Main()
    ' How to write a Visual Basic Active Messaging App that can be run
    ' from the Windows NT Schedule Service.
    ' ----------------------------------------------------------------
    ' To demonstrate this functionality, the Schedule Service MUST be
    ' run in the context of a USER ACCOUNT (not the system account.)
    ' To set the Schedule Service Context:
    '   - From the Control Panel select the Services icon
    '   - Scroll down and single click the Schedule Service
    '   - Single click the Startup button
    '   - Select "This Account", and enter YOURDOMAIN\YOURACCOUNT
    '   - It is also suggested that Startup be Manual
    '
    ' With this done, choose the Start button (you should see a dialog box
    ' indicating success). Close the Control Panel.
    '
    ' Now you need to schedule the application to execute. To do this:
    '   - From the Start Menu choose Run
    '   - At the prompt, enter "AT HH:MM PATH\MYEXE.EXE" where
    '   * HH:MM is the time the application is to execute. This is a 24
    '   hour clock, and time is based on the system clock.
    '   * PATH\MYEXE.EXE is path and filename of your EXE.
    '
    SendScheduledMsg
   End Sub

   Sub SendScheduledMsg()
    'Setup variables for use
    Dim objSession As MAPI.Session
    Dim objMsg As Message
    Dim objRecip As Recipient

    'Create Session and Logon
    Set objSession = CreateObject("mapi.session")
    objSession.Logon _
          nomail:=True, _
          profileinfo:="YOURSERVER" &amp; vbLf &amp; "YOURMAILBOX"

    'Create new Message and set properties.
    Set objMsg = _
     objSession.Outbox.Messages.Add( _
       Subject:="This is a Message Sent From a Scheduled Service", _
       Text:="This is a test")

    'Add a Recipient.
     Set objRecip = objMsg.Recipients.Add(Name:="YourRecipsEmailName")
     objRecip.Resolve

    'Send the Message and Logoff.
    objMsg.Send
    objSession.Logoff

    'Cleanup
    Set objRecip = Nothing
    Set objMsg = Nothing
    Set objSession = Nothing
   End Sub

    '   - It is also suggested that Startup be Manual, and that
