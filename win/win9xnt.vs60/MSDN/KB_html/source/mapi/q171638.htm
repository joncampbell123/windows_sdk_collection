<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
To navigate to folders in Active Messaging you need to know either the
FolderID or the name of the folder and where it is. This example assumes
that you do not know the FolderID, but that you do know what folder you are
looking for, and where it is located. For purposes of demonstration, this
example assumes that the folder you are looking for is in your local PST
(Personal Folders).
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To navigate to a folder that is not built into the session object (that is,
Inbox or Outbox), you need to know something about the folder. For example,
if you know the FolderID, then you can use the GetFolder method of the
session object. The problem with this method is that you do not always know
the FolderID, which is a string that specifies the unique identifier of the
folder.
<P>
A folder's unique identifier comes from MAPI, which assigns a permanent,
unique identifier when an object is created. This identifier does not
change from one MAPI session to another, nor from one messaging domain to
another.
<P>
If you know only the folder's location and name, you must navigate to the
folder. One way to accomplish this is to iterate through the InfoStores
until you find the one that contains your folder. Then iterate through the
folders in the InfoStore to find your target folder.
<P>
Each InfoStore contains a RootFolder. By identifying the RootFolder's name,
you know what type of InfoStore you are in. Use the following table to
determine where in the hierarchy you are:
<P>
<PRE>   INFOSTORE.NAME            TOPFOLDER.NAME
   Public Folders            IPM_SUBTREE
   Mailbox - &lt;User Name&gt;     Top of Information Store
   PST                       Top of Personal Folders

</PRE>Using the above table, you know that if you want to find the folder named
"Messaging" in the PST, you need to find a TopFolder named "Top of Personal
Folders". Then, navigate through these folders until you find the
"Messaging" folder.
<P>
One problem with this method is that you can have multiple PST files in a
profile. If this is the case, you need to employ an additional check to
make sure you are in the correct PST. Alternatively, you can check for the
name of the InfoStore instead of the name of the Root Folder.
<P>
The following code demonstrates how to use this technique.
<P>
This code sample requires a reference to the "Microsoft Active Messaging
1.1 Object Library" (Olemsg32.dll). This sample assumes that there is an
active client session running.
