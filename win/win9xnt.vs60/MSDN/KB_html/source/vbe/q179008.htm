The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition

<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition, the process you use to create an
add-in file is different from the process you use for earlier versions of
Microsoft Excel. This article contains detailed information about how to
create an add-in file in Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Add-in File Behavior</h3>
 
<P>
An add-in file in Microsoft Excel is a special type of workbook. An add-in
file can contain worksheets, chart sheets, and Visual Basic for Application
procedures and functions. Procedures and functions in an add-in file add
optional commands and features to Microsoft Excel without allowing a user
to directly view or edit them.
<P>
Unlike normal workbooks, when you open an add-in file, it is not visible on
the screen, and you cannot unhide it by clicking Unhide on the Window menu.
An add-in file is displayed in the Project Explorer window in the Visual
Basic Editor. However, you cannot view or edit an add-in file if it is
protected with a password.
<P>
<P><h3>Creating an Add-in File</h3>
 
<P>
To create an add-in file in Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition, use the
following two-part process:

<UL><LI>First, protect the projects in the workbook to prevent them from being
   viewed or edited after you create the add-in file.

<LI>Then, save the workbook as an add-in file.
<P>
</UL>Protecting the projects is very important in Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh
Edition. In earlier versions of Microsoft Excel, it is not necessary to
protect the contents of an add-in file. However, in Microsoft Excel 98
Macintosh Edition, if you do not protect projects in the workbook, others
can view or edit the sheets and Visual Basic modules in the add-in file.
<P>
For more information about converting an add-in back into a workbook in
Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition, see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : XL98: How to Convert an Add-in File into a Workbook

</PRE>Protecting the Projects in a Workbook:
<P>
To protect the projects in a workbook, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>In Microsoft Excel, click the workbook you want to convert to an add-
   in file.

<P><LI>Point to Macro on the Tools menu, and then click Visual Basic Editor.

<P><LI>In the Project Explorer window in the Visual Basic Editor, click the
   following bold entry
<P>
<P><PRE>      &lt;Project name&gt; (&lt;File name&gt;)
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;Project name&gt; is the name of the Visual Basic project, and &lt;File
   name&gt; is the name of the workbook you want to convert.
<P>
   For example, the entry is similar to the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      VBAProject (Mybook.xls)
</PRE>
<P><LI>On the Tools menu, click &lt;Project name&gt; Properties.

<P><LI>Click the Protection tab.

<P><LI>Click to select the Lock Project For Viewing check box. Type a password
   in the Password box. Type the same password in the Confirm Password
   box, and then click OK.
<P>
</OL>Saving the Workbook as an Add-in File:
<P>
To save the workbook as an add-in file, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Close the Visual Basic Editor by clicking "Close and Return to Microsoft
   Excel" on the File menu.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Properties.

<P><LI>Click the Summary tab.

<P><LI>In the Title field, enter any name for the add-in.
<P>
   The name you provide will be the name that appears in the Add-Ins dialog
   box.

<P><LI>In the Comments field, enter any text that describes the add-in.
<P>
   This description will be displayed in the Add-Ins dialog box when you
   select the Add-In in the list of available add-ins.

<P><LI>Click OK to close the Properties dialog box.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Save As.

<P><LI>In the Save As dialog box, click Microsoft Excel Add-In in the Save
   File As Type box. If you want, change the file name and click Save.
<P>
   When you click Save, Microsoft Excel creates the add-in.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Close.
<P>
</OL>After you create the add-in file, you can open the add-in file the same way
you open any workbook. If the add-in file contains an Auto_Open macro, the
macro runs and performs any actions for which it is programmed. Any
functions and subroutines in the add-in file are available for use in
Microsoft Excel.
