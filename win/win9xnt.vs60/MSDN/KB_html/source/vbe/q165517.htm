                                  =======

</PRE>The Microsoft Visual Basic Editor provides a rich set of debugging tools
that you can use to troubleshoot problems with your Visual Basic for
Applications macro code. This article describes some general debugging
techniques that you can use to debug Visual Basic for Applications code.
<P>
NOTE: This article assumes that you are using the Visual Basic Editor to
create macro code and that the code compiles correctly but does not perform
as expected.
<P>
<PRE>                             MORE INFORMATION
                             ================

</PRE>Microsoft provides programming examples for illustration only, without
warranty either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the
implied warranties of merchantability and/or fitness for a particular
purpose. This article assumes that you are familiar with the programming
language being demonstrated and the tools used to create and debug
procedures. Microsoft support engineers can help explain the functionality

<P>
<PRE>   <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/support/supportnet/refguide/default.asp">http://www.microsoft.com/support/supportnet/refguide/default.asp</A></B>

</PRE>You can use several methods to debug Visual Basic for Applications code.
Some of the commonly used techniques are described in this article.
<P>
<P><h2>USING A MESSAGE BOX TO DEBUG CODE</h2>
 
<P>
The most basic method to check the value of a variable at a specific step
in the macro is to display that value in a message box. A message box that
you use for debugging should be removed after you finish debugging.
<P>
To use a message box for debugging, enter the MsgBox function code
immediately after the line of code that uses the variable you want to
check. For example, use the following syntax
<P>
<PRE>   MsgBox &lt;NameOfVariable&gt;

</PRE>where &lt;NameOfVariable&gt; is the name of the variable you want to check.
<P>
The following sample macro displays a message box every time the value of
variable "i" changes:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub MsgBoxCheck()

      Dim i

      For i = 1 to 5

        MsgBox i

      Next i

   End Sub

</PRE>For more information about the MsgBox function, click the Office Assistant
in the Visual Basic Editor, type "MsgBox" (without the quotation marks),
click Search, and then click to view the "MsgBox Function" topic.
<P>
NOTE: If the Assistant is hidden, click the Office Assistant button on the
Standard toolbar. If Visual Basic for Applications Help is not installed on
your computer, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../office/q120802.htm">Q120802</A></B>
   TITLE     : Office: How to Add/Remove a Single Office
               Program or Component

</PRE><h2>USING BREAKPOINTS</h2>
 
<P>
You can set a breakpoint to suspend a macro that is running at a specific
statement in the macro. Typically, you set a breakpoint where you suspect a
problem exists. You clear breakpoints when you no longer need them to stop
the macro.
<P>
<P><h3>Setting Breakpoints</h3>
 
<P>
To set a breakpoint, use either of the following methods.
<P>
Method 1:

<OL><P><LI>Click anywhere in the line of code at which you want the macro to halt.
<P>
   A flashing pointer appears.

<P><LI>On the Debug menu, click Toggle Breakpoint (or press F9).
<P>
   A breakpoint is defined for that line of code (provided that a
   breakpoint was not previously defined for the line of code).
<P>
</OL>Method 2:

<OL><P><LI>Right-click the line of code that contains the breakpoint.

<P><LI>On the shortcut menu, point to Toggle, and then click Breakpoint.
<P>
</OL>When you run this code, the macro halts on the first line of code that
contains a breakpoint. Note that you can use more than one breakpoint in a
macro.
<P>
<P><h3>Clearing Breakpoints</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Click anywhere in the line of code that contains the breakpoint you want
   to remove.

<P><LI>On the Debug menu, click Toggle Breakpoint (or press F9). The breakpoint
   is removed from the line of code.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: Breakpoints are not saved with your code. So, you must configure
breakpoints for every debugging session.
<P>
<P><h2>USING BREAK MODE</h2>
 
<P>
When your code pauses, for example, when it encounters a breakpoint, the
macro is in break mode. Break mode allows you to view the current condition
of the macro. When a macro is in break mode, you can look at the values of
your variables. You can also step through the code one line at a time to
trace the logic of the macro.
<P>
<P><h3>Entering Break Mode</h3>
 
<P>
One method for entering break mode involves stepping through code from the
beginning of the macro. To do this, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click the line of code that contains the first instruction of the macro.

<P><LI>On the Debug menu, click Step Into.
<P>
   An arrow appears to the left of the first line of code.

<P><LI>On the Debug menu, click Step Over.
<P>
   This step advances the arrow to the next instruction. If the instruction
   that is highlighted is a procedure (function, sub, or property), using
   the Step Over command executes the procedure as a unit without stepping
   through the code.
<P>
   To step through a procedure line by line, click Step Into.
<P>
   NOTE: The Debug menu commands are also available on the Debug toolbar.
<P>
</OL><h3>Exiting Break Mode</h3>
 
<P>
To exit break mode, click Reset on the Run menu. This ends the break mode
session.
<P>
<P><h3>Using ToolTips</h3>
 
<P>
When you use break mode, ToolTips indicate the current value of a specified
variable.
<P>
To see a sample value displayed in a ToolTip, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>In a Visual Basic module, type the following sample subroutine:
<P>
<PRE>      Sub Test()

         Dim Name As String
         Name = "Kerry"
         Name = "Nancy"

      End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>On the Debug menu, click Step Into (or press F8) to step through the
   subroutine.
<P>
   Click Step Into again until the Name = "Kerry" line is highlighted, and
   then move the pointer over the Name variable.
<P>
   A ToolTip appears with the following text:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Name = ""
</PRE>
<P><LI>Press F8 to execute the line of code that assigns the Name variable.
<P>
   The Name = "Nancy" line should be highlighted.

<P><LI>Move the pointer over the Name variable. A ToolTip appears with the
   following text:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Name = "Kerry"
</PRE><P>
</OL>For more information about break mode, click the Office Assistant in the
Visual Basic Editor, type "Step" (without the quotation marks), click
Search, and then click to view the "Step Into, Step Over, and Step Out
Commands (Debug Menu)" topic.
<P>
NOTE: If the Assistant is hidden, click the Office Assistant button on the
Standard toolbar. If Visual Basic for Applications Help is not installed on
your computer, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../office/q120802.htm">Q120802</A></B>
   TITLE     : Office: How to Add/Remove a Single Office
               Program or Component

</PRE></OL><h2>USING THE IMMEDIATE WINDOW</h2>
 
<P>
The Immediate window displays information that results from debug
statements in your code or from commands that you type directly in the
Immediate window. In the Immediate window, you can evaluate most valid
Visual Basic for Applications statements.
<P>
<P><h3>Displaying the Immediate Window</h3>
 
<P>
To display the Immediate window, click Immediate Window on the View menu or
press CTRL+G.
<P>
<P><h3>Using the Debug Object</h3>
 
<P>
Use the Debug object to print information in the Immediate window. You can
use one method with the Debug object. This method is the Print method. The
following example uses the Debug object and the Print method:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub DebugTest()

      ' Prints a string in the Immediate window.
      Debug.Print "This text is written in the Immediate window"

      ' Prints a floating point and an integer value.
      Debug.Print 2.3, 5

      ' Outputs text and numbers.
      Debug.Print "Print the number " &amp; 2 &amp; "."

   End Sub

</PRE>For more information about the Debug Object, click the Office Assistant in
the Visual Basic Editor, type "debug" (without the quotation marks), click
Search, and then click to view the "Debug Object" topic.
<P>
<P><h3>Clearing the Immediate Window</h3>
 
<P>
The text that is printed in the Immediate window using the Debug.Print
statement or text that you type directly into the Immediate window is not
cleared when the macro is finished. This behavior is by design. You can
check the output that appears in the Immediate window after you run the
macro.
<P>
To clear the Immediate window, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click the Immediate window.

<P><LI>On the Edit menu, click Select All.

<P><LI>On the Edit menu, click Clear or Cut.
<P>
</OL><h3>Entering Commands in the Immediate Window</h3>
 
<P>
You can type commands directly in the Immediate window. For example, to
determine the name of an Office program, type the following text in the
Immediate window
<P>
<PRE>   ?Application.Name

</PRE></OL>and press ENTER.
<P>
After you press ENTER, information that is similar to the following
appears:
<P>
<PRE>   ?Application.Name
   Microsoft PowerPoint

</PRE>NOTE: You must be in break mode to enter statements in the Immediate
window.
<P>
For more information about the Immediate Window, click the Office Assistant
in the Visual Basic Editor, type "immediate window" (without the quotation
marks), click Search, and then click to view the "Use the Immediate Window"
topic.
<P>
<P><h2>USING THE LOCALS WINDOW</h2>
 
<P>
When you use break mode, the Locals window automatically displays the
values and types for all declared variables in the current procedure.
<P>
The following example uses the Locals window. To use the window, use the
following steps:

<OL><P><LI>In a Visual Basic module, type the following code:
<P>
<PRE>      Sub LocalsTest()
         Dim x As Long, y As Long, z As Long
         x = 1
         y = 2
         z = x + y
      End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>Step through the code until the "y = 2" line is highlighted. To do
   this, follow these steps:
<P>
   a. Press F8 or click Step Into on the Debug menu.
<P>
   b. Press F8 three times so that the y = 2 line is highlighted.

<P><LI>If the Locals window is not visible, click Locals Window on the View
   menu.

<P><LI>When the "y = 2" line is highlighted, the Locals Window should resemble
   the following table.
<P>
<PRE>      Expression      Value              Type
      ---------------------------------------

      x                   1              Long
      y                   0              Long
      z                   0              Long

</PRE><P><LI>Press F8 again to execute the y = 2 line. View the Locals window.
<P>
   The expression y has the value 2. If you execute the next line (z = x +
   y), z is assigned the value 3.

<P><LI>Before you execute the next line, change the value of y to 5. To do
   this, follow these steps:
<P>
   a. In the Locals window, click the value of y (2).
<P>
   b. Change the value to 5 and press ENTER.
<P>
   c. Press F8 again to execute the "z = x + y" line.
<P>
<P><PRE>      The Locals window should resemble the following table.
</PRE><P>
<PRE>         Expression      Value              Type
         ---------------------------------------

         x                   1              Long
         y                   5              Long
         z                   6              Long

</PRE></OL><h2>USING THE WATCH WINDOW</h2>
 
<P>
The Watch window also allows you to monitor the values of your variables.
Unlike the Locals window, values are not automatically populated; you must
manually add the values that appear in the Watch window.
<P>
NOTE: You can add values to the Watch window only when you are using break
mode; therefore, you must be using break mode to use the following methods.
<P>
To add a variable to the Watch window, use either of the following methods.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Right-click the variable you want to add to the Watch window. (You
   can click any occurrence of the variable.)

<P><LI>On the shortcut menu, click Add Watch.
<P>
   The Expression field should display the name of the variable that you
   clicked in step 1.
<P>
   You can also add expressions to the Watch window.
<P>
</OL><h3>Method 2</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>On the Debug Menu, Click Add Watch.

<P><LI>Type the expression you want to evaluate and click OK.
<P>
</OL>For more information about adding expressions to the Watch Window, click
the Office Assistant in the Visual Basic Editor, type "watch expressions"
(without the quotation marks), click Search, and then click to view the
"Add a Watch Expression" topic.
<P>
<P><h2>USING THE CALL STACK</h2>
 
<P>
In break mode you can use the call stack to display a list of currently
active procedure calls. When you execute code in a procedure, that
procedure is added to a list of active procedure calls. Each time a
procedure calls another procedure, it is added to the list. When control is
returned to the calling procedure, called procedures are removed from the
list. Procedures called from the Immediate window are also added to the
calls list.
<P>
<P><h2>USING CONDITIONAL COMPILATION</h2>
 
<P>
You can use conditional compilation to selectively run blocks of code. The
following sample macro uses conditional compilation:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub Test()

      #Const Debugging = 1

      Dim Name As String: Name = "Nancy"

      ' If you are debugging, change the Debugging constant to 0.
      #If Debugging = 0 Then

         ' This debug statement is not executed unless the Debugging
         ' constant is equal to zero.
         Debug.Print Name

      #End If

      Name = "Kerry"

   End Sub

</PRE></OL>The behavior of the #If...Then...#Else conditional compilation directive is
the same as the If...Then...Else statement. However, code that is excluded
during conditional compilation is completely omitted from the final
executable file; so, using conditional compilation has no size or
performance disadvantages.
