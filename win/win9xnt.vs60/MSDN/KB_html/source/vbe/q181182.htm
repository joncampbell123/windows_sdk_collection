The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In earlier versions of Word, WordBasic macro code can be hidden with the 
MacroCopy command. This command makes a macro "execute-only." In this 
state, the macro code cannot be viewed, but the macro can be run. 
<P>
This technique is useful if you are distributing macro solutions to
customers or to coworkers, and you do not want the customers or coworkers
to be able to modify the macros. This design means that some macros in the
template can be "execute-only" while others remain viewable.
<P>
In the versions of Word listed at the beginning of this article, you can
protect only an entire project (that is, all of the code within a template
or document must be either locked or unlocked). When a project is locked,
any Visual Basic for Applications code within the template cannot be
viewed.
<P>
The "More Information" section of this article discusses how templates
containing "execute-only" macros that were created in earlier versions
of Word are converted.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Templates containing execute-only macros are converted differently 
depending on whether these execute-only macros are in the Normal template 
(Normal.dot) or a custom template. 
<P>
<P><h3>Execute-Only Macros in Normal.dot</h3>
 
<P>
Word will convert the Normal template (ordinarily the first time Word is 
started after you upgrade to Word 98 or later) and will not convert any of 
the execute-only macros. A backup copy of the original Normal template will 
be saved with a default file name of "Backup of Normal" in the same 
directory or folder where the Normal template is located. This allows Word 
98 and later versions of the Normal template to be unprotected; you can 
record new macros and have all the typical programming functionality that 
Word allows. 
<P>
NOTE: The "Backup of Normal" file is only created the first time Word is 
run. If, after starting Word, you replace the Normal template file with an 
earlier version of the Word Normal template file, the backup file will not 
be created. 
<P>
<P><h3>Execute-Only Macros in a Custom Template</h3>
 
<P>
When any template other than the Normal template is converted, all execute-
only macros remain in the template, and the entire template or project is 
locked (you cannot edit code in it). This design means that custom 
solutions will still work and the code will still be protected. A 
disadvantage is that formerly-accessible macros may no longer be 
accessible. 
<P>
You will receive the "Project is unviewable" message when you attempt to do 
any of the following:

<UL><LI>Edit a converted execute-only macro.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE>
<LI>View the project contents in the Visual Basic Editor Project Explorer.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE>
<LI>View the project properties in the Visual Basic Editor Project
   Explorer.
<P>
</UL>To gain access to these macros, use either of the following methods:

<UL><LI>Access the original template in the earlier version of Word.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE>
<LI>In the earlier version of Word, remove all of the execute-only macros
   so Word will not protect the project during the conversion process.
