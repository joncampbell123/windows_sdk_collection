The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you record a macro to insert a picture (on the Insert menu point to
Picture and click From File) and,

<UL><LI>you choose Link to File,
<P>
   -and-

<LI>the picture is located in the same folder or in a folder belonging to
   the same folder as your document,
<P>
</UL>the macro records an absolute path for the picture instead of recording a
relative path as expected. When the macro is run, the field code used for
the linked picture is an absolute path instead of a relative path.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To change the path for the linked picture, edit the recorded macro and
change the path for the linked picture from "absolute" to "relative."
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you insert a picture into a document and the picture is located in
the same folder or in a folder belonging to the same folder as your
document, if you choose Link To File, the linked path for the picture is
stored as a relative path.
<P>
For example, if the document path is,
<P>
<PRE>   "Mac HD:Docs:MyWebPage:MyDoc"

</PRE>and the picture file path is,
<P>
<PRE>   "Mac HD:Docs:MyWebPage:Images:MyImage.jpeg"

</PRE>viewing the field code, the relative path is:
<P>
<PRE>   {INCLUDEPICTURE "Images:MyImage.jpeg" \* MERGEFORMAT \d}

</PRE>However, when you record a macro to insert a linked picture whose path
is relative to the document in which it is being inserted, the path is
recorded and played back as an absolute path. For example, the resulting
macro would record and play back the path to the picture, in the
IncludePicture field, as:
<P>
<PRE>   {INCLUDEPICTURE "Mac HD:Docs:MyWebPage:Images:MyImage.jpeg" \*
    MERGEFORMAT \d}

</PRE>To toggle the viewing of field codes, on the keyboard, press and hold
"option" then press F9.
