The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you execute a line of Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications code, if
the line of code cannot be executed, you may receive a truncated error
message.
<P>
For example, if you execute a statement that involves a file called
"SomeFileWithALongFileName" that does not really exist on your computer,
you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Run-time error '1004':

   'SomeFileWithALongFileName' could not be found. Check the spelling of
   the file name, and verify that the file location is correct.

   If you are trying to open the file from your list of most recently
   used files on the File menu, make

</PRE>The correct error message that you expect to receive is:
<P>
<PRE>   Run-time error '1004':

   'SomeFileWithALongFileName' could not be found. Check the spelling of
   the file name, and verify that the file location is correct.

   If you are trying to open the file from your list of most recently
   used files on the File menu, make sure that the file has not been
   renamed, moved, or deleted.

</PRE>Note the additional text after the word "make" in the preceding paragraph.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>You execute the code from the Immediate window. (In the Visual Basic
   Editor, click Immediate Window on the View menu, or press COMMAND+G.)
<P>
   -and-

<LI>The length of the error message exceeds 255 characters.
<P>
</UL>NOTE: This problem does not occur in Microsoft Excel for Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft provides programming examples for illustration only, without
warranty either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the
implied warranties of merchantability and/or fitness for a particular
purpose. This article assumes that you are familiar with the programming
language being demonstrated and the tools used to create and debug
procedures. Microsoft support engineers can help explain the functionality
of a particular procedure, but they will not modify these examples to
provide added functionality or construct procedures to meet your specific
needs. If you have limited programming experience, you may want to contact
the Microsoft fee-based consulting line at (800) 936-5200. For more

<PRE>   <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/support/supportnet/refguide/default.asp">http://www.microsoft.com/support/supportnet/refguide/default.asp</A></B>

</PRE>To see the entire error message, run the code as part of a Visual Basic
<PRE>Sub procedure (or macro) in a module. For example, instead of running the
</PRE>following line of code in the Immediate window:
<P>
<PRE>   Workbooks.Open "Macintosh HD:SomeFileWithALongFileName"

</PRE>type the following macro into a module and run it:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub Test()
       Workbooks.Open "Macintosh HD:SomeFileWithALongFileName"
   End Sub

</PRE>When you run the macro from a module, the entire error message is
displayed.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The length of the first error message listed in the "Symptoms" section of
this article (the error message that ends with the word "make"), is exactly
255 characters, including carriage returns. Because the correct, complete
error message is longer than 255 characters, the error message is cut off
when you run the code in the Immediate window.
