The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
<LI>Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release versions 2, 2.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When NET USE commands are used in a Windows NT login script to connect to
Windows NT servers in various domains, you may not be able to access those
drives.
<P>
A network drive may appear in Windows Explorer, but when you click the
drive, an error message such as "No files found" or "Access denied" may
appear. If you disconnect the network drive and then reconnect to the
same resource, you can then access the files on the drive.
<P>
Also, the following error message may occur when a login script with NET 
USE commands is being used:
<P>
<PRE>   Profile error 4: The file cannot be created. The volume may not 
   support long file names.  Some of your profile settings may not be 
   available. Do you want to see this message in future?

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This symptom can occur if all of the following conditions exist:

<UL><LI>The Windows NT domains are organized into a Multiple Master domain
   model, in which there are at least two Master (account) domains
   trusted by the Resource domains.

<LI>User accounts with the same user name, but different passwords,
   exist in more than one of the Master domains.

<LI>The NET USE command in the login script is attempting to map a drive
   to a share on a server that is a member of a Resource domain.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
You can work around this issue by ensuring that user account names are
unique across all Master Domains, so that duplicate user names do not
occur.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95. A
fix to this problem is in development, but has not been regression tested
and may be destabilizing in production environments. Microsoft does not
recommend implementing this fix at this time. Contact Microsoft Technical
Support for more information about the availability of this fix.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when different user accounts exist in different
Master domains, but with the same user name. For example:
<P>
<PRE>    Domain    User name   Password   Full name
    --------------------------------------------
    MASTER1   JOHNSMIT    abcdefg    John Smith
    MASTER2   JOHNSMIT    tuvwxyz    John Smiter

</PRE>Under these conditions, the logon domain name is not included in the user
account information sent by Windows 95 when the NET USE command is issued.
Therefore, the user name is not necessarily resolved to the correct user
account in the correct domain. The NET USE command may finish without
errors, but the command is processed for the wrong user account. If the
passwords are different, the password is incorrect for that account, and
access is denied.
