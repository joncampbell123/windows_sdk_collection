<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you are using Windows Sockets to provide stream-type connections over
IPX, or when you are running another program that uses the SPX protocol
over IPX, a connection to a remote node may intermittently fail to be
established.
<P>
Using Windows Sockets, error 10054 (WSAECONNRESET) may be returned.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Under certain circumstances, it may be possible for the same SPX
Connection ID to be assigned to more than one active SPX connection.
<P>
This is a problem with the IPX/SPX-compatible protocol (NWLINK) included
with Windows 95.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95. A
fix to this problem is in development, but has not been regression tested
and may be destabilizing in production environments. Microsoft does not
recommend implementing this fix at this time. Contact Microsoft Technical
Support for more information on the availability of this fix.
<P>
For additional information about issues resolved by updates to this
component, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:

   TITLE     : Windows Sockets Program Generates Errors In WSIPX

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The SPX Connection ID uniquely identifies each active SPX connection on a
given node running the IPX/SPX protocol. SPX keeps track of the status of
each connection by its Connection ID. If duplicate Connection IDs are
assigned, SPX cannot correctly track the status of the connection and
cannot respond correctly to received packets.
<P>
This symptom, although rare, is more likely to occur when a program is
creating many SPX connections very rapidly.
