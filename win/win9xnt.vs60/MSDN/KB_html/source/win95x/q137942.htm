The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you perform a backup operation in Microsoft Backup, it may take
longer than you expect. This poor performance may or may not be
accompanied by poor hard disk performance while you perform other tasks
in Windows 95.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior can be caused by any of the following factors:

<UL><LI>Lack of available memory.

<LI>Hard disks that are using MS-DOS Compatibility mode. This mode may be
   in use for either the file system or for virtual memory.

<LI>Poor hard disk performance due to other factors, such as a less than
   optimal hard disk and controller configuration, or the use of disk
   compression on a computer with a relatively slow processor.

<LI>File fragmentation on the hard disk.

<LI>Unusable sectors on the backup tape.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Lack of Available Memory</h3>
 
<P>
A lack of available memory is typically caused by having too many programs
open at the same time, or by not having enough physical RAM installed in
the computer. To resolve this problem, close all running programs before
starting the backup process. If doing so does not improve performance,
remove all programs from the Startup folder and from the "load=" and
"run=" lines in the Win.ini file, and restart Windows 95. If performance
is still poor, you may need to add more physical RAM to your computer to
improve performance.
<P>
<P><h3>Hard Disks Using MS-DOS Compatibility Mode</h3>
 
<P>
If the Performance tab in System properties shows that one or more of the
hard disks in your computer is using MS-DOS Compatibility mode, resolving
this problem should improve performance in Backup. For more information
about troubleshooting MS-DOS Compatibility mode, please see the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../zmiscellaneous/q130179.htm">Q130179</A></B>
   TITLE     : Troubleshooting MS-DOS Compatibility Mode on Hard Disks

</PRE>To access the Performance tab, double-click the System icon in Control
Panel, and then click the Performance tab.
<P>
<P><h3>Poor Hard Disk Performance</h3>
 
<P>
Even if your hard disks are not using MS-DOS Compatibility mode, the
performance of Backup may be affected by the performance of your hard
disks. If you are using an IDE hard disk, the performance of the hard disk
may be affected by another device that is connected to the same IDE
controller channel. Older hard disks with slow access speeds, CD-ROM
drives, and tape drives all may adversely affect performance when
connected to the same IDE controller channel as your hard disk. To resolve
this problem, move the slower device to a separate IDE controller, or to
the second IDE channel on an EIDE dual-port controller.
<P>
If you are using disk compression on a computer with a relatively slow
processor, hard disk performance may not be as good as if you were not
using disk compression. If you are using third-party disk compression
software that uses a real-mode driver to access your compressed drives,
you may be able to improve performance by replacing the real-mode driver
with a protected-mode driver. For information about obtaining such a
driver, contact the manufacturer of your third-party disk compression
software.
<P>
<P><h3>File Fragmentation on Hard Disk</h3>
 
<P>
Badly fragmented hard disks can affect the performance of Backup, as well
as the performance of other tasks in Windows 95. To resolve this problem,
run Disk Defragmenter to defragment your hard disks. To run Disk
Defragmenter, click the Start button, point to Programs, point to
Accessories, point to System Tools, and then click Disk Defragmenter.
<P>
<P><h3>Unusable Sectors on Backup Tape</h3>
 
<P>
Backup can detect and avoid unusable sectors on a tape, but the process
that it uses to do so can be time consuming. If you suspect that
performance problems in Backup are caused by unusable sectors on a tape,
try using a new tape, or a tape that you know does not contain unusable
sectors.
