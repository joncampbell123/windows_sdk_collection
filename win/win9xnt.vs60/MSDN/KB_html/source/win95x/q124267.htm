The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes switches that correct some display problems that can
occur in Microsoft Windows 95.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The [boot] section of the SYSTEM.INI file should contain the following line
for any Windows 95 version of a display driver:
<P>
<PRE>   DISPLAY.DRV=PNPDRVR.DRV

</PRE>The actual video driver (such as VGA.DRV or S3.DRV) is loaded from the
registry. This allows support for dockable personal computers that have
different adapters for the laptop versus the docking station.
<P>
Setting the monitor type in the display properties does not affect the
refresh rate output by your display adapter. To change this, you must run a
utility supplied by your display adapter manufacturer or computer
manufacturer. Some display utilities must be run in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file;
however, on other computers, display type is set in BIOS configuration
programs.
<P>
Examples of display utilities from adapter manufacturers include the
following:
<P>
<PRE>   ATI                      INSTALL.EXE
   Cirrus Logic             MONTYPE.EXE, CLMODE.EXE
   Diamond Stealth          STLMODE.EXE
   Tseng Labs               VMODE.EXE
   Western Digital          VGAMODE.EXE

</PRE>The sections below describe different video cards and the requirements for
these drivers to work correctly in Windows 95.
<P>
<P><h3>ATI Mach 8/32/64</h3>
 
<P>
This adapter must be configured correctly using the ATI INSTALL.EXE program
for Windows 95 to use high-resolution modes properly. Correct setting of
your monitor type is especially important. This is because the high-
resolution modes may not be available for selection, or the computer may
fail when attempting to switch to that mode.
<P>
<P><h3>Compaq QVision 2000</h3>
 
<P>
These adapters use the Matrox MGA controller.
<P>
<P><h3>Matrox MGA</h3>
 
<P>
These adapters are supported with Windows 95 drivers. The VGA driver
is installed by Setup.
<P>
<P><h3>Diamond Stealth 64</h3>
 
<P>
For True Color support (16.7 million colors) add TrueColor=24 in the
[DISPLAY] section of the SYSTEM.INI
<P>
<P><h3>Diamond Viper</h3>
 
<P>
Setup preserves Microsoft Windows 3.1 drivers for this adapter when Setup
is run from within Windows 3.1. Setting up Windows 95 from MS-DOS causes
the Windows 95 VGA driver to be installed. If this occurs, the Diamond
Viper setup program should be used to install the Windows 3.1 drivers into
Windows 95. Copy the latest Viper files from the Drivers directory on the
Windows 95 CD.
<P>
<P><h3>IBM ThinkPad</h3>
 
<P>
This laptop uses Western Digital controllers. Older versions of these
laptops require the IBM VESA driver file to be loaded in Autoexec.bat
(Ibmvesa.com) or in Config.sys (Vesa.exe) for 256-color and high-resolution
modes to be supported by the Windows 95 Western Digital display driver.
Newer versions of these laptops do not require the use of the IBM VESA
driver.
<P>
<P><h3>S3-Based Video Adapters</h3>
 
<P>
Windows 95 provides a hardware acceleration slider that can be used to
correct graphics problems:

<UL><LI>If you have problems with your mouse pointer, disable the hardware
   cursor by setting the slider to the Most setting.

<LI>If you experience miscellaneous hangs with your S3 adapter, disable
   memory-mapped I/O by setting the slider to the Basic setting.

<LI>If you have problems with a modem on COM 4, please see the following
   article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ARTICLE-ID  :  <B><A href="../win95x/q127138.htm">Q127138</A></B>
<PRE></PRE>      TITLE       :  S3 Video Driver Conflicts with COM4

</PRE></UL>If you continue to have problems, try the None setting.
<P>
For more information on how to use the slider to change the way
Windows 95 uses the video card, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE       :  Troubleshooting Video Problems in Windows 95

</PRE>Manually adding "HighColor=15" (no quotes) to the [Windows] section of
the WIN.INI file corrects incorrect color at 16 bits per pixel using a
555 format.
