<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
You can use the MouseKeys feature to control the mouse pointer with the
keyboard. Although Windows 95 is designed so that you can perform all
actions without a mouse, some programs may still require one.
Additionally, a mouse may be more convenient for some tasks.
<P>
The MouseKeys feature is also useful for graphic artists and others who
need to position the mouse pointer with great accuracy. You do not need
to have a mouse to use the MouseKeys feature.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Turning MouseKeys On and Setting Options</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Control
   Panel.

<P><LI>Double-click the Accessibility Options icon.

<P><LI>On the Mouse tab, click the Use MouseKeys check box to select it.

<P><LI>Click Settings.

<P><LI>Set the options you want, and then click OK.

<P><LI>Click OK to return to Control Panel.
<P>
</OL><h3>Turning MouseKeys on Using the Keyboard</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Press CTRL+ESC to open the Start menu.

<P><LI>Use the ARROW keys to select Settings, press RIGHT ARROW to select
   Control Panel, and then press ENTER.

<P><LI>Use the ARROW KEYS to select the Accessibility Options icon, and then
   press ENTER.

<P><LI>Press SHIFT+TAB to select the Keyboard tab, and then press RIGHT
   ARROW until the Mouse tab is selected.

<P><LI>Press ALT+M to select the Use MouseKeys check box.

<P><LI>To configure the MouseKeys options, press the S key.

<P><LI>Set the options you want, and then press ENTER.

<P><LI>Press ENTER to return to Control Panel.
<P>
</OL>If you have the Keyboard Shortcut option for MouseKeys enabled, you can
press LEFT ALT+LEFT SHIFT+NUM LOCK. This key combination activates the
emergency keystroke for MouseKeys. You might, for example, want to use
this keystroke with a system policy or user profile in which the
shortcut option is turned on but MouseKeys is turned off.
<P>
<P><h3>Moving the Mouse Pointer with MouseKeys</h3>
 
<P>
When MouseKeys is active, use the following keys to move the mouse
pointer:

<UL><LI>On the numeric keypad, press any of the numeric keys immediately
   surrounding the 5 key to move the pointer in the direction
   indicated by the arrows on the keys.

<LI>Press the 5 key for a single mouse click and the plus sign key (+)
   for a double-click.

<LI>To drag an object, place the pointer on the object and press the
   INSERT key to begin dragging. Press DELETE to release the object.

<LI>To select the left, right, or both mouse buttons for clicking, press
   the slash key (/), the minus key (-), or the asterisk key (*),
   respectively.

<LI>To cause the pointer to jump across large sections of the screen,
   hold down the CTRL key while you press the movement keys.

<LI>To move the pointer a single pixel at a time for greater accuracy,
   hold down the SHIFT key while you press the movement keys.
<P>
</UL><h3>Using NUM LOCK to Toggle the Numeric Keypad</h3>
 
<P>
You can use the NUM LOCK key to toggle the numeric keypad from a
MouseKeys control pad to a regular numeric keypad. This feature can be
useful with laptop or notebook computers that do not have a separate
numeric keypad.
