<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the Send command in a MAPI-aware program to send a fax with
Microsoft Exchange, you may receive one of the following error messages:

<UL><LI>Word couldn't send mail because of MAPI failure:
   (0x00000002/0x00000000).

<LI>The item could not be sent. A default set of folders could not be
   found. Your active profile must include such a set, such as a
   personal folder file. Microsoft Exchange Client - 9995 - [8100270B]
<P>
</UL>When you try to send a fax by printing to the Microsoft Fax service from a
MAPI-aware program, you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   General Error!

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
These errors occur when the Microsoft Exchange profile you are using to
send faxes is not configured properly. To send faxes using Microsoft Fax,
your profile must include the following information services:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Fax
<LI>Personal Address Book
<LI>Personal Folders
<P>
</UL>A "General Error!" message can occur when the Subject field in any cover
page, including custom cover pages, includes text.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To correct this problem, use the appropriate method:
<P>

   and then click Properties.

   OK.

<P><LI>If the Personal Folders service or a Personal Information Store is
   not listed in the "The following information services are set up in
   this profile" box, click Add, click Personal Folders, click OK, type
   a name for the personal folders, click Open, and then click OK.

<P><LI>Click OK, and then click Close.
<P>
</OL><h3>Method 2</h3>

<P>
<P><PRE>      cd\windows
      deltree forms

<P><LI>Click Start, point to Programs, and then click Windows Explorer.

<P><LI>Verify that your computer is configured to view hidden files. For 
   information about how to view hidden files, please see the following 
   article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../win95x/q141276.htm">Q141276</A></B>
<PRE></PRE>      TITLE     : How to View System and Hidden Files in Windows 95

</PRE><P><LI>Verify the following files exist in the c:\Programs Files\Exchange 
   folder:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Mlset32.exe
      Mlshext.dll
</PRE><P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Personal Folders information service contains your mail folders (in a
.pst file). When you send a fax, the Personal Folders service is required
for the following reasons:

<UL><LI>The .pst file is used as a temporary store while you are composing a
   fax. When you send the fax, it is stored in the Outbox mail folder
   until it is sent, and it is stored in the Sent Items folder after it
   is sent.

<LI>If there is a problem sending the fax, a mail message from the System
   Administrator describing the problem is delivered to the Inbox folder.
<P>
</UL><h3>Notes</h3>
 

<UL><LI>Note that similar problems can also occur after you install Windows
   Messaging. To resolve this issue, uninstall Windows Messaging and use
   the Microsoft Exchange client instead. This should allow you to send
   faxes with text in the Subject line.

<LI>A similar problem can also occur if the computer name contains the
   "@" character (and possibly other special characters). To check the
   computer name, double-click Network in Control Panel, and then click
   the Identification tab.
