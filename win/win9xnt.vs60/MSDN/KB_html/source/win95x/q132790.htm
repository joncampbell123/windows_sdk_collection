<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you open a file with a .wri extension from cc:Mail version 2.1,
WordPad starts automatically, and the cc:Mail window is minimized, but you
are unable to restore the cc:Mail window after closing WordPad.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When you run a .wri file from cc:Mail, cc:Mail attempts to run the
program that the .wri extension is associated with, and the cc:Mail
window is minimized. Even after you upgrade to Windows 95, the following
line, found in the [extensions] section of the Win.ini file, causes .wri
files to be associated with Write.exe:
<P>
<PRE>   wri=write.exe ^.wri

</PRE>However, in Windows 95, Write.exe has been replaced with a program stub
that starts WordPad (Wordpad.exe). Therefore, when you open a .wri file
from cc:Mail in Windows 95, Write.exe starts, which in turn starts WordPad.
When you then quit WordPad, the Write.exe stub remains in memory. Because
the original program run from cc:Mail, Write.exe, has not been closed, the
cc:Mail window is not automatically restored. In fact, the cc:Mail window
cannot be restored until the Write.exe program is closed.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Modify the [extensions] section of the Win.ini file so that the line that
reads
<P>
<PRE>   wri=write.exe ^.wri

</PRE>reads:
<P>
<PRE>   wri=c:\progra~1\access~1\wordpad.exe ^.wri

</PRE>NOTE: Changing the program that .wri files are associated with in
Windows Explorer does not correct this problem.
