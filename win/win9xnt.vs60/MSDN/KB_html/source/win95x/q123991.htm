<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you try to print from a Windows 95 computer running the Coactive
Network, you receive an "Out of paper" error message.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Windows, including Windows for Workgroups 3.1x and Windows 95,
does not provide support for the Coactive Network.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
No workaround is available at this time. For more information, contact
Coactive Network technical support.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Coactive Network uses an application called Coassistant to make printer
connections. Although it appears that this application can "see" the
network printer, Windows 95 cannot print to it. The file-sharing portion of
the Coactive Network seems to function, and some computers running Windows
for Workgroups 3.1x may be able to print to the network printer.
<P>
Coactive Network is manufactured by a vendor independent of Microsoft; we
make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
performance or reliability.
