<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95

</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you create a shortcut to a resource on a mapped network drive, and
then remap the same drive to a different network resource, Windows
attempts to connect to the original network resource when you access the
shortcut.
<P>
Furthermore, when you re-establish the original connection, a different
drive letter may be mapped to the original resource. This may cause
programs to fail because the expected drive mappings are not present.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is part of the mechanism by which Windows attempts to
resolve and automatically maintain shortcuts to network resources.
<P>
For additional information about Windows shortcut resolution, please
see the following articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

</PRE><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Individual shortcuts can be modified by using the Shortcut.exe tool to
remove Universal Naming Convention (UNC) path information from the
shortcut. 
<P>
Note that to successfully use the Shortcut.exe tool to remove UNC path
information from a shortcut, it must meet the following criteria:

<UL><LI>The shortcut must contain both UNC and static path information. You
   can verify the shortcut contains the static path by right-clicking the
   shortcut, clicking Properties, and then clicking the Shortcut tab. The
   path in the Target box should be in the following format:
<P>
<P><PRE>      &lt;drive&gt;:\folder\filename.ext
</PRE><P>
   You can verify the shortcut contains the UNC path information by viewing
   the shortcut in Notepad. To do so, click Start, click Run, and then type
   the following line in the Open box
<P>
<P><PRE>      notepad &lt;path&gt;\&lt;shortcut.lnk&gt;
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;path&gt; is the path to the shortcut you want to change, and
   &lt;shortcut.lnk&gt; is the name of the shortcut from which you want to remove
   the UNC path information. 
<P>
   You may need to click Word Wrap on the Edit menu to view the shortcut
   file. The shortcut file contains primarily unreadable binary
   information, however you should be able to read the UNC and mapped drive
   information. Do not modify or save the shortcut file.

<LI>The drive specified in the static path has been mapped to a network
   share different than the original one referred to by the shortcut.

<LI>The mapped drive must contain a directory path structure and a file
   whose name matches that of the static path in the shortcut.
<P>
</UL>The Shortcut.exe tool can be obtained from the following locations:
<P>
<P><h3>Windows 95</h3>
 
<P>
The Shortcut.exe tool is included in the Microsoft Windows 95 Resource Kit
and is also located in the Admin\Apptools\Envvars folder on the Windows 95
CD-ROM.
<P>
<P><h3>Windows NT</h3>
 
<P>
The Shortcut.exe tool is included in the Microsoft Windows NT Server
Resource Kit Version 4.0, Supplement One, in the I386\Desktop folder,
MIPS\Desktop folder, and ALPHA\Desktop folder on the Windows NT Server
Resource Kit CD-ROM.
<P>
For more information about how to resolve this issue in Windows NT, please

   TITLE     : Shortcuts Created Under NT 4.0 Resolve to UNC Paths

</PRE>To remove the UNC information from a shortcut, follow these steps:
<P>
NOTE: If you want to disable only the automatic resolution, and you are not
concerned about deleting the UNC path information from the shortcut, you
should perform only steps 1 and 2. The shortcut must contain both a UNC
path and a static path.
<PRE> 
</PRE><P><LI>Click Start, point to Programs, and then click Command Prompt or MS-DOS
   Prompt.

<P><LI>Use the Shortcut.exe tool to disable automatic network shortcut 
   resolution with this shortcut. To do so, type the following line at the
   command prompt, and then press ENTER
<P>
<P><PRE>      shortcut.exe -s &lt;path&gt;&lt;shortcut.lnk&gt;
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;path&gt; is the path to the shortcut you want to change, and
   &lt;shortcut.lnk&gt; is the name of the shortcut from which you want to remove
   the UNC path information.

<P><LI>Click Start, point to Programs, click Windows NT Explorer or Windows
   Explorer, and then locate the shortcut you specified in step 2.

<P><LI>Rename the shortcut. When you rename the shortcut, Windows updates the
   shortcut so that it does not perform automatic network shortcut
   resolution. Do not change the extension of the shortcut.
<P>
   For information about how to rename a file, click Start, click Help,
   click the Index tab, type "renaming" (without quotation marks), and then
   double-click the "Renaming files" topic.
<P>
   NOTE: You must rename the shortcut file in Windows NT Explorer or
   Windows Explorer. The shortcut is not updated if you rename it at a
   command prompt.

<P><LI>Use the Shortcut.exe tool to resolve the shortcut to a static location
   and the delete the UNC path information. To do so, type the following
   line at a command prompt and then press ENTER
<P>
<P><PRE>      shortcut.exe -r &lt;path&gt;\&lt;shortcut.lnk&gt;
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;path&gt; is the path to the shortcut you want to change, and
   &lt;shortcut.lnk&gt; is the name of the shortcut from which you want to remove
   the UNC information.

</PRE></OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Automatic resolution may be undesirable if the file pointed to by the
shortcut has been deliberately moved to a different resource, or if a load-
balancing mechanism is in place so that the same drive letter may be mapped 
to one of several network resources with identical contents. 
<P>
When you right-click a shortcut, click Properties, and then click the
Shortcut tab, the Target box specifies the path to the file and can contain
either a UNC path (\\server\share\directory\filename.ext), or a static path
(&lt;drive:&gt;\directory\filename.ext).
<P>
A shortcut to a network resource may have either type of path as the target
depending on how it was created. For example, if the shortcut was created
by right-clicking a network file and clicking Create Shortcut, it contains
a static path and a UNC path.
<P>
When you run Shortcut.exe with the -s parameter to disable automatic
network shortcut resolution, depending on the type of shortcut and the
status of any network drive mappings, the following results occur when you
double-click the shortcut:
<P>
<P><h3>Shortcut Containing UNC Path Only</h3>
 
<P>
Disabling automatic shortcut resolution in a local shortcut, or one
containing only UNC information, has no effect on the manner in which
the shortcut is resolved.
<P>
<P><h3>Shortcut Containing UNC and Static Paths</h3>
 
<P>
For a shortcut that contains both UNC and static paths, shortcut resolution
is more complex. If the you have not disabled shortcut resolution, then the
original network resource is used. If the shortcut is mapped to the drive
specified in the static path, that drive is used. If the resource is mapped
to a different drive, the new drive is used, and the shortcut's static path
is updated with the new drive information. If the resource is not currently
mapped to a drive, one is assigned automatically, and the shortcut is
updated with the new drive information.
<P>
If shortcut resolution has been disabled, it is resolved to the specified
static path. Note that the original UNC path information is still contained
within the shortcut.
<P>
If the original network share is mapped to the drive specified in the
static path, the shortcut is resolved to it, but the UNC path information
is not deleted from the shortcut.
<P>
If a different network share has been mapped to the drive indicated by the
static path, and the static path points to an existing file on that drive,
then the UNC information is removed from the shortcut, and the shortcut is
resolved like a local shortcut.
