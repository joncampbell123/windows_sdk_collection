The information in this article applies to:

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The mixer program included with your Paradise sound card may not work after
you upgrade to Windows 95. Additionally, the mixer control included with
Windows 95 does not affect the volume of sounds being played.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Paradise card is really both a SoundBlaster 8-bit sound card and a
Microsoft Windows Sound System-compatible sound card. Windows 95 installs
drivers for both of these cards, causing previous proprietary volume-
control methods to not work. The Windows 95 mixer control does work, but it
is operating on the default audio device. If the default device is not the
device being used (such as when the default device is the SoundBlaster
device and you are playing a 16-bit file, so the Windows Sound System-
compatible device is being used), adjusting the controls has no effect.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Set the Windows Sound System-compatible device as the preferred device
using the Multimedia tool in Control Panel.
