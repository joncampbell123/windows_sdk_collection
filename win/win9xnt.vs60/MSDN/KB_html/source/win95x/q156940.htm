The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you are running Windows 95 on a computer with an Intel 82371SB PIIX3
IDE hard disk controller, Windows 95 may not detect devices installed on
the secondary IDE channel. If the devices are initially detected and
appear in Device Manager, they may no longer appear in Device Manager
the next time you restart the computer.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Intel 82371SB PIIX3 IDE hard disk controller is not included in the
Mshdc.inf file included with Windows 95. Therefore, although the
controller is detected by Windows 95 and appears in Device Manager, it
may not be properly configured. This may prevent devices on the secondary
IDE channel from being detected or installed properly.
<P>
The following computers are known to contain Intel 82371SB PIIX3 IDE hard
disk controllers:

<UL><LI>Dell Dimension Pentium Pro 200
<LI>Hewlett-Packard Vectra VL 5/xxx Series 4
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This situation is most likely caused by design changes in Windows 95.
Microsoft has confirmed that this situation is not caused by problems
in Windows 95.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
For information about how to work around this problem, please contact
Intel.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This problem affects all Intel motherboards that contain the 82371SB
PIIX3 onboard IDE hard disk controller. When you install Windows 95 on a
computer that contains an 82371SB PIIX3 controller, the controller is
detected and installed by Windows 95. However, because the Mshdc.inf file
does not contain configuration information for the controller, the
secondary IDE channel on the controller may not be configured properly.
<P>
Because the secondary channel is not configured properly, it is typically
disabled by the BIOS the next time you restart your computer. This causes
Windows 95 to determine that the devices installed on the secondary
channel have been removed from your computer, and causes Windows 95 to
remove the devices from Device Manager.
<P>
To determine if the 82371SB PIIX3 IDE hard disk controller in your
computer is configured properly, double-click the System icon in Control
Panel, click the Device Manager tab, and then double-click the Hard Disk
Controllers branch to expand it. If the following devices appear under the
Hard Disk Controllers branch, the 82371SB PIIX3 controller is not
configured properly and the problem described in this article is likely to
occur:

<UL><LI>Primary IDE Controller (single FIFO)
<LI>Standard Dual PCI IDE Controller
<LI>Standard IDE/ESDI Hard Disk Controller
