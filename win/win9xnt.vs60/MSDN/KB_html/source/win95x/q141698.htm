<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how to use the Winipcfg tool to review your current
TCP/IP network protocol settings. This can be useful when you are
troubleshooting problems, such as problems connecting to your Internet
provider.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To view your current TCP/IP settings using Winipcfg, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click the Start button, and then click Run.

<P><LI>Type the following line in the Open box, and then click OK:
<P>
<P><PRE>      winipcfg
</PRE><P>
</OL>Your current TCP/IP settings are displayed. To view additional information,
click More Info.
<P>
NOTE: The Winipcfg display is not updated dynamically. To view changes,
quit Winipcfg and then run it again.
<P>
If your IP address was dynamically allocated by a Dynamic Host
Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server, you can use the Release and Renew
buttons to release and renew the IP address.
<P>
The following sections describe the settings displayed by the Winipcfg
tool.
<P>
Adapter Address:
<P>
This string of hexadecimal numbers represents the hard-coded identification
number assigned to the network adapter when it was manufactured. When you
are viewing the IP configuration for a PPP connection using Dial-Up
Networking, the number is set to a default, meaningless value (because
modems are not hard-coded with this type of address).
<P>
IP Address:
<P>
This is the actual IP networking address that the computer is set to. It is
either dynamically assigned to the computer upon connection to the network,
or a static value that is manually entered in TCP/IP properties.
<P>
Subnet Mask:
<P>
The subnet mask is used to "mask" a portion of an IP address so that TCP/IP
can determine whether any given IP address is on a local or remote network.
Each computer configured with TCP/IP must have a subnet mask defined.
<P>
Default Gateway:
<P>
This specifies the IP address of the host on the local subnet that provides
the physical connection to remote networks, and is used by default when
TCP/IP needs to communicate with computers on other subnets.
<P>
The following settings are displayed if you click More Info:
<P>
DHCP Server:
<P>
This specifies the IP address of the DHCP server. The DHCP server provides
the computer with a dynamically assigned IP address upon connection to the
network. Clicking the Release and Renew buttons releases the IP address to
the DHCP server and requests a new IP address from the DHCP server.
<P>
Primary and Secondary WINS Server:
<P>
These settings specify the IP address of the Primary and Secondary WINS
servers (if available on the network). The WINS servers provide a service
translating NetBIOS names (the alphanumeric computer names seen in the user
interface) to their corresponding IP address.
<P>
Lease Obtained and Lease Expires:
<P>
These values show when the current IP address was obtained, and when the
current IP address is due to expire. You can use the Release and Renew
buttons to release and renew the current IP address, but this is not
necessary because the DHCP client automatically attempts to renew the lease
when 50 percent of the lease time has expired.
