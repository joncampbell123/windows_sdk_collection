<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has added support for Infrared Data Association (IrDA)
connectivity to Windows 95. The latest release of the Infrared (IR)
Communications Driver for Windows 95 is version 2.0.
<P>
Infrared (IR) communications, based on technology similar to that used in
remote controls, offers a convenient and reliable way to connect to
peripheral devices without cables. IrDA connectivity is designed to take
advantage of mobile computing features already built into Windows 95 and
supports Plug and Play.
<P>
The Infrared Communications Driver version 2.0 is an optional component of
the Windows 95 operating system. The Infrared Communications Driver
supports hardware devices which enable networking and communications over
infrared media. The hardware device can be an infrared port built into the
platform or an infrared adapter connected to one of the platform's serial
or parallel ports.
<P>
Infrared devices and Infrared Communications Driver 2.0 provide the
following benefits:

<UL><LI>You can use wireless infrared links instead of serial and parallel
   cables. For example, instead of using a serial or parallel cable, you
   can exchange files between two computers that are equipped with an
   infrared device and Infrared Communications Driver 2.0. You can also
   print to infrared-capable printers without the need for cable.

<LI>With IrLan you can use wireless infrared links rather than network
   cable to access your local area network (LAN). IrLan currently supports
   Access Point Mode. Access Point Mode enables a computer with an IrDA
   adapter to attach to a local area network through an access point
   device that acts as the network adapter for the computer.
<P>
   An access point device is hardware supporting both a LAN network
   interface controller (NIC) and an infrared transceiver. For
   communication over the infrared link, the access point device runs a
   protocol stack that conforms to the IrDA standards and runs the IrLan
   protocol over the IrDA stack. The access point device implements a
   network adapter for the client using infrared as the bus for accessing
   the adapter.
<P>
   Currently there are two companies building Access Points: Hewlett-
   Packard (HP) and Extended System. Infrared Communications Driver 2.0
   has been tested on both access points.
<P>
</UL>Infrared Communications Driver 2.0 supports infrared communications links
running at speeds up to 115.2 Kbps.
