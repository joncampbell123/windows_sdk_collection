kbenv kbtshoot
<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes the three parts of the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Invalid VxD dynamic link call from &lt;Part 1&gt; to device &lt;Part 2&gt;,
   service &lt;Part 3&gt;

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Normally, an Invalid Dynamic Link Call error message is the result of an
incompatibility between driver versions, or a damaged or missing driver.
Try uninstalling and then reinstalling any programs or components that you
installed recently (before the error message occurred).
<P>
The error message stated above may occur because your computer is
configured incorrectly. This may be due to a device driver that was added
or removed recently.
<P>
<P><h3>Part 1</h3>
 

<UL><LI>Part 1 may be divided into an encoded device name, object number, and
   offset, such as "VMM(0A) + 0000001C." This example means the problem
   was detected in the VMM virtual device driver, in object 0A, at offset
   0000001C.

<LI>If Part 1 is an eight-character sequence of letters and numbers, such as
   "C13A1EC6," a device driver jumped to an invalid location. The identity
   of the driver could not be determined.
<P>
   If this is the case, restart your computer in Safe mode by pressing the
   F8 key when you see the "Starting Windows 95" message, then choosing
   Safe Mode from the Windows 95 Startup menu. If the error message does
   not reoccur, the problem may be caused by one of the installed device
   drivers. For information about how to create a new System.ini file
   without third-party drivers, see the following article in the Microsoft
   Knowledge Base:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../win95x/q140441.htm">Q140441</A></B>
<PRE></PRE>      TITLE     : Creating a New System.ini File Without Third-Party
                  Drivers

</PRE></UL><h3>Part 2</h3>
 

<UL><LI>If Part 2 is the name of a device (such as VMD), the named device
   driver should be upgraded to a Windows 95-compatible version.
<P>
   When this type of error occurs, it means Part 1 requested that Part 2
   perform an operation that Part 2 does not support. This typically
   means that there is a version mismatch between the two drivers.
<P>
   If this is the case, make certain Part 1 and Part 2 are compatible. If
   the driver identified in Part 2 is provided with Windows 95, make sure
   the driver identified in Part 1 is designed for Windows 95.
<P>
   The driver identified in Part 2 may not be compatible with Windows 95
   because a newly installed program may have replaced the Windows 95
   standard driver with a customized driver. This is typically the case
   for device drivers marked with an exclamation point in the table below.

<LI>If Part 2 is a four-character sequence of letters and numbers, such as
   "0418," a device driver required by the system could not be found.
   See the below table for a list of commonly encountered device
   drivers and their identification numbers.
<P>
   If this is the case, install the missing driver or remove the driver
   identified in Part 1 that requires it.
<P>
</UL><h3>Part 3</h3>
 
<P>
Part 3 provides the service ordinal (for example, it identifies which
service from Part 2 was requested but could not be satisfied).
<P>
If the service number is unusually large (for example, the first two
digits are not both zero), the problem may be that Part 1 is damaged.
However, service numbers as large as 0191 are not unusual if the
device driver identified in Part 2 is VMM.
<P>
If Part 3 is unusually large, reinstall the driver identified in Part
1. Remember, Part 1 may contain a device name, an object number, and
an offset.
<P>
<P><h3>How to Determine a Device Driver's Source</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>The device driver name may suggest the name of the program that
   installed it. For example, CCVKD is the virtual keyboard device driver
   installed by Carbon Copy. Virtual devices often begin with the letter
   "V" and end in the letter "D." For example, VNAVD is the Norton Anti-
   Virus device driver.
<P>
   If you are successful in identifying the source of the driver, remove
   the corresponding program.

<P><LI>The device driver name may begin with the letters "NW," suggesting
   that it may be a Novell NetWare networking driver. Other clues that
   may identify a driver as network-related are the presence of the
   letters "NDIS," "NET," or "SERVER."

<P><LI>If you are unable to identify the program or component that installed
   the driver, search the [386Enh] section of the System.ini file
   for a line with the following form
<P>
<P><PRE>      Device=&lt;DeviceName&gt;.386
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;DeviceName&gt; is the name of the device driver, possibly with a
   path, or possibly with a slightly modified name. For example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Device=ccvkd.386
</PRE>
<P><LI>If the driver that needs to be replaced is one of the Windows 95
   standard drivers, run Windows 95 Setup again, and choose to verify the
   installation.
<P>
</OL>The following table lists virtual device drivers you may encounter.
<P>
Legend:
<P>
# - Indicates a standard Windows 95 driver.
<P>
! - Indicates a standard Windows 95 driver that may have been replaced by
<PRE>    a third-party product.

</PRE></OL>$ - Indicates a driver provided by a third-party manufacturer.
<P>
3.0 - Indicates a driver from Windows 3.0.
<P>
3.1, 3.11 - Indicates device drivers that have been superseded by drivers
<PRE>            in Windows 95.
