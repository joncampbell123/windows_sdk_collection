The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95

<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article contains steps to help you troubleshoot problems playing .avi
files in Windows 95.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Program-Specific Problems</h3>
 
<P>
Try to play the .avi file with different programs such as Media Player,
Windows Explorer, and the program the .avi file was included with.

<OL><P><LI>If there is a problem viewing the .avi file with a third-party program,
   try to play the file using Media Player. If you can play the .avi file
   with Media Player, contact the third-party program's manufacturer.

<P><LI>If you cannot play the .avi file with Media Player, the file may be
   damaged. Try to play another .avi file. If you do not have another
   .avi file, connect to the Microsoft Download Service and download
   Avisampl.exe. If you can play other .avi files, the problem may be
   related to the codec used to create the .avi file. For information about
   how to obtain the Avisampl.exe file, see the following article in the
   Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../zmiscellaneous/q119383.htm">Q119383</A></B>
<PRE></PRE>      TITLE     : AVI Files Available for Testing Video for Windows Runtime

</PRE><P><LI>If you cannot play any .avi file, the MCI video device may be disabled.
   To enable it, double-click Multimedia in Control Panel, click the
   Advanced tab, double-click Media Control Devices, double-click Motion
   Video Device, click the Use This Media Control Device check box to
   select it, and then click OK.
<P>
</OL><h3>Playback Device Not Configured Properly</h3>
 
<P>
If the .avi file plays poorly (jerky video or breaks in the sound), the
problem may be related to the video playback size setting. By default,
Windows 95 sets video playback to be twice the original size of the video
clip. To achieve better playback quality, use the following steps to
adjust the video playback size:

<OL><P><LI>Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then double-
   click Multimedia.

<P><LI>On the Video tab, click Windows, and then click Original Size in the
   Window box.

<P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
</OL><h3>CD-ROM Throughput Not Fast Enough</h3>
 
<P>
If an .avi file plays poorly (jerky video or breaks in the sound) from the
CD-ROM drive, the .avi file's target rate may exceed the CD-ROM drive's
throughput. Use the following steps to determine the .avi file's target
rate:

<OL><P><LI>In Windows Explorer, use the right mouse button to click the .avi file,
   and then click Properties on the menu that appears.

<P><LI>Click the Details tab and note the Video Format information. The
   file's target video playback rate is listed in KB/sec.
<P>
</OL>Most files are recorded at a target data rate (video and sound included) of
less than or equal to 300 KB/sec.
<P>
If there is enough free space on your hard disk, copy the .avi file to your
hard disk (to an uncompressed drive, if possible) and test the playback of
the file. If there is not enough free space on your hard disk, test a
smaller .avi file with the same properties.
<P>
If the file plays correctly from your hard disk, your CD-ROM drive may not
be providing fast enough throughput and may need to be optimized. For
information about optimizing CD-ROM drive access in Windows 95, see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../zmiscellaneous/q141368.htm">Q141368</A></B>
   TITLE     : Poor Performance from CD-ROM-Based Program

</PRE></OL>If playback of the .avi file does not improve after optimizing, you may
need to use a faster CD-ROM drive or play .avi files from your hard disk.
<P>
<P><h3>Playing .avi Files as Links or Over the Network</h3>
 
<P>
The playback of an .avi file linked into a document or across the network
can cause poor playback performance. Access time to files on the network
can vary depending on network traffic and the hardware being used. For
better playback, you should copy .avi files to and play them from your hard
disk.
<P>
<P><h3>Video Driver Displays Colors Incorrectly</h3>
 
<P>
If the .avi file flashes or displays incorrect colors during playback, the
problem may be related to the video driver you have installed. Check the
.avi file format for the number of colors (such as 8-bit or 24-bit color).
If you are using a video driver with 16 colors, .avi files with 256 or more
colors will look very different during playback or may not play at all.
Such .avi files will have a washed-out look during playback because of the
dithering (converting from 256 to 16 colors) that takes place. Use one of
the following steps to resolve these problems:

<UL><LI>Install a display driver with higher color capabilities, or adjust
   the color palette of your current display driver to use more colors.

<LI>Remove and reinstall your display driver.

<LI>Obtain and install an updated display driver designed for Windows 95
   from the manufacturer of your video adapter, if available.
<P>
</UL><h3>Problems with Sound During .avi File Playback</h3>
 
<P>
If there are breaks in sound during playback of the .avi file or there is
no sound, the sound card may not be configured properly. Sound in an .avi
file is not usually compressed, so you can test playback of an uncompressed
file such as the Chimes.wav file included with Windows 95. If .wav files do
not play correctly, see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../zmiscellaneous/q140334.htm">Q140334</A></B>
   TITLE     : Troubleshooting Wave Sound File Problems in Windows 95

</PRE>NOTE: Make sure the volume is set properly for your sound card, and check
that the .avi file was captured with sound by looking at the properties for
the file and checking the audio format.
<P>
<P><h3>Codec Is Not Installed or Is Damaged</h3>
 
<P>
If you receive a message about a codec that is missing or not installed
when you try to play an .avi file, make sure that the required codec is
installed. Use the following steps to find out which codec was used to
compress the .avi file:

<OL><P><LI>In Windows Explorer, use the right mouse button to click the .avi file,
   and then click Properties on the menu that appears.

<P><LI>Click the Details tab and note the Video Format information. The codec
   used to compress the file is the last piece of information listed.

<P><LI>Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then double-
   click Multimedia.

<P><LI>On the Advanced tab, double-click Video Compression Codecs. If the
   codec used to compress the file is not listed, you must install it.
<P>
</OL>Windows 95 includes the following 32-bit video codecs:

<UL><LI>Intel Indeo (IR31 or IR32)
<LI>Supermatch Cinepak
<LI>Microsoft RLE (MS-RLE)
<LI>Microsoft Video 1 (MS-CRAM)
<P>
</UL>You may also receive a message about a codec that is missing or not
installed if the codec that the .avi file is attempting to use is damaged.
Use the following steps to remove and reinstall a 32-bit video codec:

<OL><P><LI>Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then double-
   click Multimedia.

<P><LI>On the Advanced tab, double-click Video Compression Codecs.

<P><LI>Click the codec you want to remove, click Properties, click Remove,
   and then click Yes when you are prompted.

<P><LI>Close the Multimedia Properties dialog box.

<P><LI>Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then double-
   click Add New Hardware.

<P><LI>Click Next, click No, and then click Next.

<P><LI>In the Hardware Types box, double-click Sound, Video, And Game
   Controllers.

<P><LI>In the Manufacturers box, click the appropriate item:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - for RLE and Video 1, click Microsoft Video Codecs
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - for Cinepak, click SuperMatch
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - for IR31 or IR32, click Intel
</PRE>
<P><LI>Click the appropriate codec in the Models box, click Next, and then
   click Finish. If you are prompted to restart Windows 95, do so.
<P>
</OL>If you have a 16-bit video codec installed, you should disable it and
install a corresponding 32-bit video codec. 16-bit video codecs are listed
in the [Drivers] section of the System.ini file and usually begin with the
word "VIDC." To disable a 16-bit codec, place a semicolon (;) at the
beginning of the corresponding line in the System.ini file, save the
System.ini file, and then restart Windows 95.
<P>
<P><h3>Display Problems</h3>
 
<P>
Reduce the graphics acceleration setting. To do so, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Right-click My Computer, and then click Properties.

<P><LI>Click the Performance tab, click Graphics, and then move the
   Hardware Acceleration slider to one notch from the left.

<P><LI>Click OK, and then click Close.

<P><LI>Click Yes when you are prompted to restart your computer.
