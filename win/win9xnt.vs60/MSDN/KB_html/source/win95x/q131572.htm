<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you delete a file from the Recycle Bin, you are prompted to confirm
that you want to delete the file, even though you have cleared the Display
Delete Confirmation Dialog check box in Recycle Bin properties.
<P>
You are also prompted to confirm that you want to delete files when you
empty the Recycle Bin.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
You are automatically prompted to confirm that you want to delete files
when you are permanently removing files from your computer. Deleting files
from the Recycle Bin, or emptying the Recycle Bin, permanently removes
files from your computer.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To delete files without receiving a confirmation dialog box, delete them
from an MS-DOS prompt session.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Display Delete Confirmation Dialog check box is cleared automatically
if you select the "Do not move files to the Recycle Bin" check box in
Recycle Bin properties. When this check box is selected, files are
permanently removed from your computer when you delete them.
<P>
You can also permanently remove files from your computer by holding down
the SHIFT key while you delete them in Windows Explorer.
