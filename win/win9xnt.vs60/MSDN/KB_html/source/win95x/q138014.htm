The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you try to copy a file onto itself, you receive a Confirm File
Replace dialog box prompting you to confirm that you want to replace the
existing file. If you click Yes, the file may be truncated to zero bytes.
If you click No, the file is unchanged.
<P>
This problem occurs only when you copy a file onto itself using two
different views of the same network resource (such as when you have two
different drive letters mapped to the same network resource, or when you
have two UNC connections to the same network resource), or when you copy
a file onto itself using a drive created with the SUBST command.
<P>
NOTE: If you try to move (rather than copy) a file in this manner, the
file may be deleted.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has released a new version (4.00.951) of the Shell32.dll file
(817,664 bytes) that corrects this problem.
<P>
To install this update, download the Windows 95 Service Pack 1 Update
Setup.exe file from one of the sources listed below.
<P>
In addition to correcting the problem described in this article, the new
version of Shell32.dll provides the ability to browse printers from the
Add Printer Wizard for users of the Microsoft Service for NetWare
Directory Services (NDS). Users of the standard network clients included
with Windows 95 can already browse printers and do not require this update
to browse for printers.
<P>
<P><h3>Installation</h3>
 
<P>
To correct the problem described in this article, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Download the Setup.exe file from one of the online services listed
   below to an empty folder.

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This problem does not affect most users, because copying a file onto
itself is an unnecessary task. In addition, this problem occurs only in
the following circumstances:

<UL><LI>The problem occurs only when you copy a file onto itself on a drive
   using drive mapping (such as a mapped network drive or a drive created
   with the SUBST command) or a UNC connection. Users in non-networked
   environments, and users who do not use the SUBST command, are not
   affected by this problem.

<LI>The problem occurs only if you use two views of the same network
   resource, or drive created with the SUBST command, and copy a file
   onto itself. For example, the problem may occur if you map drive X to
   the \\&lt;server&gt;\&lt;folder&gt; network resource, map drive Y to the same
   network resource, and then copy a file from the root folder of drive X
   to the root folder of drive Y.

<LI>The problem occurs only with files of a certain size. While preliminary
   testing indicates that only files smaller in size than approximately
   234K are affected, the affected file size is also dependent on the size
   of the local and network buffers, and may vary based on configuration.
