The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Print Agent for NetWare Networks (MSPSRV) is a 32-bit
(protected-mode) service that replaces Novell NetWare's RPRINTER and
PSERVER commands. MSPSRV runs in the background taking the place of Novell
NetWare's RPRINTER terminate-and-stay-resident program (TSR) and acts as
the print server. MSPSRV lets a Windows 95-based computer accept and print
jobs from a NetWare print queue (version 2.15 or later) to a local printer
attached to an LPT port.
<P>
When you are loading Novell NetWare's RPRINTER, you can specify a printer
number and print server. Make sure that the print server is configured to
print on Printer0-Remote Parallel, LPT1:. Using RPRINTER, you could have a
dedicated computer running Pserver.exe acting as the print server and
directing the job to the RPRINTER node. This is not necessary or possible
with MSPSRV because the functionality built into MSPSRV replaces both
RPRINTER and PSERVER.
<P>
This article describes how to install MSPSRV.
<P>
NOTE: To install MSPSRV, you must be the administrator of the NetWare
server.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Should I Install the Microsoft Print Agent for NetWare?</h3>
 
<P>
If either of the following conditions are true, you should use the
Microsoft Print Agent for NetWare instead of the File and Printer Sharing
for NetWare Networks service to share a printer:

<UL><LI>If you want the print queue to reside on a NetWare server.

<LI>If there are computers on your network using the shared printer
   and running real-mode NETX or VLM clients.
<P>
</UL>If you do not want the print queue to reside on a NetWare server, or if
there are no computers on your network running a real-mode NetWare client
and using the shared printer, you can use the File and Printer Sharing for
NetWare Networks service to share the printer. In this case, you do not
gain any functionality by using the Microsoft Print Agent for NetWare
instead of the File and Printer Sharing for NetWare Networks service.
<P>
Notes:

<UL><LI>If there are computers on your network running real-mode NetWare
   clients and using the shared printer, you can use the File and Printer
   Sharing for NetWare Networks service to share the printer. However,
   the real-mode client computers must capture a printer port and print
   to that captured port, instead of printing directly to the shared
   printer.

<LI>When you use the Microsoft Print Agent for NetWare to share the
   printer, the print queue resides on a NetWare server and is
   administered using the NetWare PCONSOLE tool. When you use the File
   and Printer Sharing for NetWare Networks service to share the printer,
   the print queue resides on a Windows 95-based computer and is
   administered from the printer's property sheet.

<LI>When you use the File and Printer Sharing for NetWare Networks service
   to share the printer, you can also share other resources that can be
   accessed by computers running the Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks
   or the real-mode NETX or VLM client.
<P>
</UL><h3>Preparing to Install the Microsoft Print Agent for NetWare</h3>
 
<P>
Before you install MSPSRV, make sure the following conditions are met:

<UL><LI>The local printer is connected to the Windows 95-based computer and
   you can print to it from Windows 95.

<LI>You can connect to the NetWare server on which the print queue exists.

<LI>The Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks must be installed (File and
   Print Sharing for NetWare Networks does not need to be installed).
<P>
</UL><h3>How to Add the Microsoft Print Agent for NetWare</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>In Control Panel, double-click Network.

<P><LI>Click Add, click Service, click Add, and then click Have Disk.
<P>
   NOTE: If MSPSRV has ever been installed on the computer, the Microsoft
   Print Agent for NetWare Networks will already be listed as a service
   under Microsoft and you do not have to click Have Disk to install it.

<P><LI>Type the path to the Admin\Nettools\Prtagent folder on the Windows
   95 CD-ROM, and then click OK.

<P><LI>When the Microsoft Print Agent service has been added to the list of
   installed network components, click OK. You must restart your
   computer for the changes to take effect.
<P>
</OL><h3>How to Activate the Microsoft Print Agent for NetWare</h3>
 
<P>
Once MSPSRV is installed, use the following steps to activate it:

<OL><P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Printers.

<P><LI>Use the right mouse button to click the default printer, and then
   click Properties on the menu that appears.

<P><LI>On the Details tab, click Capture Printer Port.

<P><LI>Verify that LPT1 is selected in the Device box, and that the Path
   box is empty. Click OK.

<P><LI>Click the Print Server tab. (If this tab is not available, MSPSRV has
   not been installed correctly.)

<P><LI>In the NetWare Server box, click the appropriate NetWare server.

<P><LI>Click OK.

<P><LI>Restart your computer.
<P>
</OL>For installation instructions for MSPSRV, please view the "Using Microsoft
Print Services for NetWare" topic in the Windows 95 Resource Kit Help file
(Win95rk.hlp). The Win95rk.hlp file is located in the following folder on
the Windows 95 CD-ROM:
<P>
<PRE>   Admin\Reskit\Helpfile

</PRE></OL>To view this topic, double-click the Win95rk.hlp file, double-click System
Configuration, double-click Printing And Fonts, and then double-click
"Using Microsoft Print Services for NetWare."
<P>
<P><h3>Setting Up the NetWare Print Server and Print Queue</h3>
 
<P>
The following steps describe how to set up a Novell NetWare print server
and print queue for use with MSPSRV. This requires a working knowledge of
the NetWare PCONSOLE utility. If you need assistance creating a NetWare
print server or print queue using PCONSOLE, please consult your NetWare
documentation.

<OL><P><LI>Using PCONSOLE, create a print server. Configure the print server for
   a remote LPT1 printer connected to the Windows 95-based computer that
   will run MSPSRV.

<P><LI>Using PCONSOLE, create a print queue. Assign the print queue to the
   print server created in step 1.

<P><LI>In the properties for the configured printer, click the Print Server
   tab, select the NetWare server on which the print queue resides from
   the list of NetWare servers, and then select the name of the print
   server that you created in step 1 from the list of print servers.

<P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: The Print Server tab appears in the printer's properties only if the
Print To The Following Port setting on the Details tab is set to LPT1.
