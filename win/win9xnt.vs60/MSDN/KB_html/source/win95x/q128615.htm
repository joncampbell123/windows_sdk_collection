The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you are running Windows 95 Setup on a Dell computer with a PCI bus,
the detection process may stop at 80 percent complete. When this occurs,
you see the error message "Divide By Zero."
<P>
If you restart the computer and use Safe Recovery to finish Setup, more
than one logical drive letter may be assigned to a single SCSI drive in
the computer. For example, when you try to access drive E you see the
contents of drive C instead.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem can occur on a Dell computer with a PCI bus and the following
configuration:

<UL><LI>The computer has a built-in NCR 810 SCSI controller without an external
   SCSI connection.

<LI>The computer has a second SCSI controller connected to the same SCSI
   bus cable as the first SCSI controller. The connection path for the
   SCSI controllers and devices is as follows:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Built-in SCSI controller
<PRE></PRE>         |
      Internal devices attached to the built-in SCSI controller (such as
      logical drive C)
         |
      Second SCSI controller
         |
      External devices attached to the second SCSI controller

</PRE></UL>This connection path causes both controllers to drive the same SCSI bus,
resulting in the symptoms described above.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Use either of the following methods to work around this problem:

<UL><LI>Disable the built-in SCSI controller and use the new controller for
   all the SCSI devices.

<LI>Use the second SCSI controller only for external devices. Use the
   built-in SCSI controller only for internal devices. Do not connect
   the two SCSI controllers to the same SCSI bus.
