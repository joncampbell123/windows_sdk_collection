<LI>When you try to print to the DeskJet printer, you may receive an error
   message stating that the printer is offline.

   Windows 95, you receive an error message stating that Unidrv.dll is
   already in use.

<LI>When you print to a Hewlett-Packard (HP) color DeskJet 5xx-series
   printer, you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Cannot print to device LPT1
</PRE>

</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>

The Windows 3.1 drivers for the HP DeskJet printer were not successfully
upgraded to the Windows 95 versions.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this problem, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Double-click the Printers icon in Control Panel.

<P><LI>Use the right mouse button to click the HP DeskJet printer, and then
   click Delete on the menu that appears.

<P><LI>If there is more than one HP DeskJet printer in the Printers folder,
   repeat step 2 for each HP DeskJet printer.

<P><LI>Locate and remove the following files in the Windows folder:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Deskjet.ini
      Deskjetc.ini
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: Your computer may have only one of these files, or both.

<P><LI>Locate and remove the following files in the Windows\System folder.
   To avoid deleting files that may be crucial to other HP components,
   delete only these files:
<P>
<P><PRE>      DESKJETC.DRV
      HPDSKJET.DRV
      HPSETUP3.DLL
      HPV1284.DLL
      HPV500.HPC

      TBKCOMP.DLL
      TBKNET.EXE
      TBKUTIL.DLL
      TBOOK.EXE
</PRE>
<P><LI>Rename all the Oem&lt;n&gt;.inf files in the Windows\Inf folder, where &lt;n&gt;
   is an incremental number starting at 0.
<P>
   NOTE: Do not use the oem*.inf wildcard to rename files. Doing so may
   cause the wrong files to be renamed. For information about rebuilding
   the driver information database, please see the following article in
   the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

</PRE><P><LI>If the HP DeskJet Status Monitor is in the Startup group, remove it.
   To do so, follow these steps:
<P>
   a. Use the right mouse button to click the taskbar, and then click
<P><PRE>      Properties on the menu that appears.
</PRE><P>
   b. Click the Start Menu Programs tab, and then click Remove.
<P>
   c. Double-click the Startup branch to expand it.
<P>
   d. Click the HP DeskJet Status Monitor shortcut, and then click
<P><PRE>      Remove.
</PRE><P>
   e. Click Close.

<P><LI>Restart your computer.

<P><LI>Use the Add Printer Wizard to reinstall the HP DeskJet printer.
<P>
   NOTE: Make sure to select the DeskJet driver included with Windows 95,
   not the Windows 3.x HP printer driver. If the new Deskjet Printer does
   not show up in the Add New Hardware List, remove the Drvidx.bin and
   Drvdata.bin files from the Windows\Inf folder. This will cause the Add
   New Hardware Device Database list to be updated with the new printer.
