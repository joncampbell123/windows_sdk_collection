<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how to install Windows 95 using a PCI network
adapter and an Msbatch.inf file for batch installations of Windows 95.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft does not encourage or support changes to .inf files; therefore,
Microsoft Technical Support does not support the procedure in this
article. Although we have tested the following procedure and it appears
to function as described, make a backup copy of your .inf file before you
proceed.
<P>
When you are installing Windows 95 over the network using a PCI network
adapter, the network adapter is not recognized until after the first
reboot. Therefore, you have no network connectivity to finish copying all
the necessary drivers. However, using an Msbatch.inf file, you can specify
the network adapter on the "netcards=" line in the [Network] section of
the file. When you do this, all of the necessary drivers are copied at the
first reboot, but you receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Windows Networking
   Your network adapter &lt;network adapter name&gt; is not working properly.
   You may need to set it up again. For more information, see the Network
   Troubleshooter in Windows Help.

</PRE>When you click OK, Setup proceeds normally. This occurs because the driver
is installed, but the PCI bus has not been enumerated. Once the bus has
been enumerated, the adapter functions correctly and this error message
does not occur.
<P>
This error message can interrupt an automated network installation. To
work around this error message, follow these steps:
<P>
In the Msbatch.inf file, modify the [Install] section to include the
following line:
<P>
<PRE>   AddReg=pcinic.reg

</PRE>Also, add the following section and key to the Msbatch.inf file:
<P>
<PRE>   [pcinic.reg]
   HKLM,\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Class\Net\0000,
   "DisableWarning",,"1"

   NOTE: This line should be typed as a single line. It has been wrapped
   in this article for readability purposes.

   NOTE: For multiple adapters, multiple registry entries may be needed in
   the Msbatch.inf file. For example two network adapters may require the
   following section and keys:

      [pcinic.reg]
      HKLM,\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Class\Net\0000,
      "DisableWarning",,"1"
      HKLM,\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Class\Net\0001,
      "DisableWarning",,"1"

</PRE>NOTE: If you are installing Dial-Up Networking, this procedure is not
needed because the error message does not occur.
