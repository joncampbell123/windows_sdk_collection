The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.1, 3.11
<LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11
<LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you try to view files on or set up programs from a shared CD-ROM
drive on the network, you may experience one or more of the following
symptoms:

<UL><LI>You may receive "File not found" error messages.

<LI>The server or the client may stop responding (hang).

<LI>The server or the client may exit to an MS-DOS prompt.

<LI>You may not be able to view all the files in one or more folders on
   the CD-ROM although you do not receive any error messages.
<P>
</UL>These symptoms may occur even though the CD-ROM files can be viewed and
accessed correctly from the computer that is sharing the CD-ROM drive.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior can occur if the CD-ROM being shared is not fully ISO 9660
compliant, the computer sharing the CD-ROM drive is using a real-mode
Mscdex.exe device driver with a file version of 2.25 (or earlier), and the
Mscdex.exe device driver is being started with the /S parameter to allow
the CD-ROM drive to be shared on the network.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Share the CD-ROM drive from a computer running Microsoft Windows NT
Workstation or Server version 3.5 (or later), or from a computer running
Windows 95 using the 32-bit Compact Disk File System driver (Cdfs.vxd).
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The real-mode Mscdex.exe driver is compliant with ISO 9660, which does not
allow for directory entries that span sectors. Therefore, excess bytes at
the end of each directory sector are zero-filled. Mscdex.exe requires at
least one of these zero-byte fillers at the end of each directory sector in
order to traverse the shared CD-ROM directory on a network server.
<P>
If a CD-ROM is mastered with disk authoring tools that do not comply
completely with the ISO 9660 specification, a file may be written to the CD-
ROM with a directory entry that is in perfect alignment with a sector
boundary on the disk, not allowing for at least one zero-byte filler at the
end of the directory sector.
<P>
The Windows NT Workstation and Server version 3.5 and Windows 95 32-bit
compact disk file systems allow the sharing of non-ISO 9660-compliant CD-
ROMS.
