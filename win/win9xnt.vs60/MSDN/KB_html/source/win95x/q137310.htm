<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you insert a particular audio CD in the CD-ROM drive, it may not be
recognized and CD Player may not be started automatically, even if the
Auto Insert Notification option is turned on.
<P>
If you start CD Player manually, the CD-ROM drive light may flash
continuously, and you may receive the following message:
<P>
<PRE>   Data or no disc loaded
   Please insert an audio compact disc.

</PRE>Most other audio CDs are recognized automatically.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Your IDE CD-ROM drive is not fully compatible with the ATAPI 1.2
specification for IDE CD-ROM drives.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Contact the manufacturer of the CD-ROM drive about obtaining a firmware
update to bring the drive into compliance with the ATAPI 1.2 specification.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following IDE CD-ROM drives are known to exhibit the behavior described
in this article:
<P>
<PRE>   Manufacturer           Model    Firmware revision
   -------------------------------------------------
   Panasonic/Matsushita   CR-581   Earlier than 1.04
   NEC                    273      Earlier than 4.21

</PRE>This behavior occurs with a few audio CDs that are mastered in an unusual
manner. Normally, track 1 begins at the 2-second mark on the disc. On the
audio CDs that trigger this behavior, track 1 does not begin at the 2-
second mark. When the Windows 95 CD-ROM driver attempts to locate track 1,
the drive reports a status that is not expected under the ATAPI 1.2
specification. Based on the status returned from the drive, the Windows 95
CD-ROM driver tries to find track 1 continuously, never receiving the
expected result code from the drive.
<P>
The following audio CDs are known to cause this behavior:
