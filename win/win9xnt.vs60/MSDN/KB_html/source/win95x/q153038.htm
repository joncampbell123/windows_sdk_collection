This article describes how to automate a Dial-Up Networking connection in
Windows 95. The following topics are discussed:

<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Windows 95 and Microsoft Plus! include a Dial-Up Scripting tool that you
can use to automate Dial-Up Networking connections using script files. A
script file contains scripting commands, parameters, and expressions that
provide information to and retrieve information from the remote computer
you are connecting to. This information may include your user name and
password, port information, carriage returns, line feeds, and pauses.
Script files are created using a text editor (such as Notepad) and are
assigned to an existing Dial-Up Networking connection using the Dial-Up
Scripting tool.
