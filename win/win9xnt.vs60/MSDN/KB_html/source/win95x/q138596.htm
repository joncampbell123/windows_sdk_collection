<P><h2>INSTALLING THE SERVICE FOR NDS</h2>
 
<P>
If you already have Windows 95 installed, and you wish to install the
Service for NDS, you must do this via the Network Control Panel.
Thus, if you wish to install it on multiple computers running Windows
95, you will have to do this on each computer.
<P>
To install the Service for NDS on a computer running Windows 95,
follow these steps:
1. In Control Panel, double-click the Network icon
2. Click Add.
3. Double-click Service.
4. Click Have Disk, and then type the drive name for the disk or
network drive where the Service for NDS files are located.
<P>
WARNING  Do not click Cancel during the installation. If, for some
reason, you decide that you do not want to install the Service for
NDS, you must complete the installation process, and then remove the
Service for NDS. For more information on removing the Service for
NDS, see UNINSTALLING THE SERVICE FOR NDS in this document.

<OL><P><LI>The next time you start your computer, you are prompted to log in
</OL>to the NDS tree. Make sure the dialog box refers to the correct
context and tree.
<P>
<P>
If you wish to install Service for NDS at the same time that you
install Windows 95, you may do so in either of the following two
ways:
1. You may include Service for NDS in an automated installation of
Windows 95. Automated installation uses a file called MSBATCH.INF in
order to install Windows 95 without requiring any user intervention.
Because you can include Service for NDS in this procedure, you will
not have to install it separately at each computer.
2. You may install Service for NDS from within the Windows 95 setup
program. During Windows 95 setup, choose to do a "Custom"
installation. At the Network Configuration screen during setup,
follow steps 2-5 above.
<P>
You can also include Microsoft Service for NDS in server-based
installations of Windows 95.
<P>
For more information about these options, please refer to the
MSNDS.HLP file included with the Service for NDS. This help file must
be viewed on a computer running Windows 95.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>UNINSTALLING THE SERVICE FOR NDS</h2>
 
Note:  You cannot remove the Service for NDS from a computer running
a shared installation of Windows 95.
<P>
Before you begin, make sure your Windows 95 Setup disk is nearby.
During the removal process, you are prompted for files located on it.

<OL><P><LI>In Control Panel, double-click the Network icon.
</OL>2. Click Service for NetWare Directory Services, and then click Remove.
<P>
Note:  When Windows 95 is copying networking files from your Windows
95 Setup disk, a message will appear several times, saying that older
versions of files are being copied to your computer, and asking
whether you want to keep the newer version that is currently on your
computer. In order to remove the Service for NDS, click No for the
following files: NWREDIR.VXD, NWNP32.DLL, and NETWARE.TMP.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>OTHER DOCUMENTATION FOR THE SERVICE FOR NDS</h2>
 
For detailed information about installing, configuring, and using
Service for NDS, see MSNDS.HLP, which is included in this
distribution of Service for NDS. This help file must be viewed on a
computer running Windows 95.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>RUNNING NDS-AWARE APPLICATIONS</h2>
 
If your users need to run NetWare applications (including NDS ones)
with Windows 95 and Service for NDS, they will need access to, and
the appropriate license to use, the following Novell-supplied files:
<P>
NWCALLS.DLL
NWLOCALE.DLL
NWIPXSPX.DLL
NWNET.DLL
NWGDI.DLL
NWPSRV.DLL
<P>
These DLLs are also needed if you wish to use the Passwords option in
Control Panel in order to change passwords on bindery servers.
<P>
The Microsoft Service for NDS searches for these files in locations
in the user's search path statement. If you put these files in a
directory on a server, make sure the directory is in each of your
users' search path statements. We recommend that you place these
files in the SYS:PUBLIC directory of your users' preferred servers.
<P>
Some third-party NDS-aware applications expect these Novell DLLs to
be loaded. Service for NDS does not load these DLL's by default, but
there is a system policy you can set to have these dll's loaded. See
MSNDS.HLP for more information.
<P>
Many third-party NDS-aware applications access the unicode tables in
the PUBLIC\NLS directory on the server. It is important that you put
this directory in your search path (by mapping a search drive) in
order to run such applications. If the NLS directory is not in the
search path, the application may show an error message stating that
the unicode tables could not be found, or that the Context could not
be set.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>KNOWN ISSUES</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>ADDING PRINTERS: BROWSING FOR NDS PRINTERS FROM THE ADD PRINTER WIZARD</h3>
 
If you choose "Browse" from the Add Printer wizard, you will not be
able to see NDS printers. (You will see bindery printers). There will
soon be an update to a Windows 95 component named SHELL32.DLL that
will fix this. This fix can be found in the same online location as
the Service For NDS. For example, on the World Wide Web, go to
<B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows">http://www.microsoft.com/windows.</A></B> From there, go to the Software
Library, then to Windows 95 Updates.
<P>
Warning: do not update to this new English version of SHELL32.DLL if
you are not running an English version of Windows 95. Localized
versions will be made available at a later date.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>BRIEFCASE: COPYING FILES FROM A DRIVE LETTER THAT IS MAPPED TO THE ROOT</h3>
 
Copying a file to the Briefcase from a network drive that is mapped
to the root does not work in Service for NDS.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>WINPOPUP: SENDING MESSAGES TO NDS USERS</h3>
 
Winpopup allows you to receive NetWare messages. However, it does not
allow you to send messages to NDS users. You can send messages to
bindery users. You may use Novell's SEND command or the NETUSER
utility to send messages to NDS users.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>RUNNING NT AND NETWARE LOGIN SCRIPTS</h3>
 
If you are running both the Service for NDS and the Client for
Microsoft networks, Windows NT login scripts will always run before
NetWare login scripts, regardless of which client is primary.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>AVAILABILITY IN OTHER LANGUAGES</h2>
 
As of this writing (October 13, 1995), the Service for NDS is
available in English only. A German version will be made available
near the end of October. Some other localized versions will be made
available in the next few months. It is possible to use the English
version of Service for NDS with some localized versions of Windows
95. However, some of the user interface will then be in English.
<P>
<P><h2>PRODUCT SUPPORT INFORMATION</h2>
 
The support policy for Service for NDS is the same as the Windows 95
support policy. See SUPPORT.TXT in the Windows directory for detailed
information about Windows 95 product support.
