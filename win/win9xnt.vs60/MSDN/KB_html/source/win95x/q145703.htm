<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you try to run a program that uses the IPX/SPX protocol, such as
ArcServe Backup Agent for NetWare by Cheyenne, you may receive the
following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Windows Socket error, Couldn't create socket(10047)

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This error can occur if the Wsock32.dll file is missing, is damaged, or
has been replaced by a third-party protocol stack's sockets interface.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Extract a new copy of the original Wsock32.dll file. To do so, follow
these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Rename the Wsock32.dll file in the Windows\System folder to
   Wsock32.3rd.

<P><LI>Use the Extract tool to extract a new copy of the Wsock32.dll file from
   your original Windows 95 disks or CD-ROM to the Windows\System folder.
   For information about using the Extract tool, please see the following
   article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

</PRE></OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
A socket contains three pieces of information: an internetwork address,
a protocol, and a port number. The address information must contain a
network ID and a node ID. Because both TCP/IP and IPX/SPX have network
and node information incorporated in their addressing schemes, either
protocol can use the sockets interface. The port number combined with
the protocol determines whether the socket uses TCP, UDP, or IPX, and
which service will be used.
<P>
The component files that make up the sockets interface for Windows 95 are
Winsock.dll and Wsock32.dll. The files that are included with Windows 95
support the sockets interface for both TCP/IP and IPX/SPX. The Cheyenne
ArcServe Agent makes calls directly to Wsock32.dll to obtain an IPX socket
for communication with a NetWare server to perform backup operations over
the network.
<P>
Because some third-party vendors may require functionality from the
sockets interface for their proprietary protocol stacks, they may replace
the component files that make up the sockets interface with their own
proprietary versions of these files. If the third-party vendor's sockets
interface does not support sockets using IPX/SPX, any program that uses
the sockets interface to communicate using IPX/SPX may generate an error
message.
