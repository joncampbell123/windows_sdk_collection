The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, you should first make a backup copy of the
registry files (System.dat and User.dat). Both are hidden files in the
Windows folder.
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use Policy Editor to modify the search mode used by the Microsoft
Client for NetWare Networks, the registry key relating to the search mode
is modified, but the search mode functionality provided by the Microsoft
Client for NetWare Networks is unchanged.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When you use Policy Editor to modify the search mode used by the Microsoft
Client for NetWare Networks, the SearchMode value under the following
registry key is changed to a DWORD value, and assigned the value that you
specify in Policy Editor:
<P>
<PRE>   Hkey_Local_Machine\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\VxD\Nwredir

</PRE>This registry value is given a value of 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, or 7, which normally
causes the Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks to use the appropriate
search mode. However, for the search mode to be properly modified, the
SearchMode value must be a binary value, not a DWORD value.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
NOTE: For information about how to edit the registry, view the Changing
Keys And Values online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Note
that you should make a backup copy of the registry files (System.dat and
User.dat) before you edit the registry.
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall Windows 95. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved.
Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
To correct the problem described in this article, use Registry Editor to
delete the existing SearchMode value under the following registry key:
<P>
<PRE>   Hkey_Local_Machine\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\VxD\Nwredir

</PRE>After you delete the SearchMode value, create a new binary value with the
same name, and assign it one of the following values:
<P>
<PRE>   Value    Description
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------
   0 or 1   Uses the default search mode. The Microsoft Client for NetWare
            Networks searches the search drives only when no path is
            specified in the program and after the default directory has
            been searched.

   2        Causes the Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks not to search
            any search drives to find supporting files. The program
            behaves as if you were running it without networking. If the
            program has a defined directory path for searching and opening
            files, the program searches for the files in that path.

   3        The same as 1, except that if the program has no defined
            directory path to search and open files, the Microsoft Client
            for NetWare Networks searches the search drives only if the
            open request is a read-only request.

   5        Causes the Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks to always
            search the search drives, even if the program specifies a
            path.

   7        The same as 5, except that the Microsoft Client for NetWare
            Networks searches the search drives only if the open request
            is a read-only request.

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
