The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article is a general overview of how to connect two or more computers
running Windows 95 to form a network.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
You can connect two or more computers running Windows 95 using the
following methods:

<UL><LI>Using a network adapter in each computer.
<P>
   NOTE: If you connect computers using network adapters and twisted-pair
   cable, please note that you need a 10Base-T hub to connect the
   computers, unless the cable is specifically designed to bypass a hub.
   If you connect computers using network adapters and Thinnet (BNC/COAX)
   cable, please note that you must connect the cable to each network
   adapter using a T-connector with a terminator at each end of the cable.

<LI>Using your modem as a dial-up adapter to dial into a Dial-Up Networking
   Server (a component of Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95) or other remote
   server.

<LI>Using Direct Cable Connection (DCC).
<P>
   NOTE: A maximum of 2 computers can be connected at a time using DCC.
<P>
</UL><h3>Connecting with Network Adapters</h3>
 
<P>
NOTE: This section assumes that each computer has a network adapter
installed and that your computers are connected together properly using
network cable. For information about how to configure your network adapters
and physically connect your computers, consult the documentation included
with your network adapters or contact the manufacturer(s) of your network
adapters.
<P>
After the physical connections are made, use the Add New Hardware tool in
Control Panel to detect your network adapter. Once the network adapter is
set up, follow these steps to make sure the correct network components are
installed:

<OL><P><LI>Use the right mouse button to click Network Neighborhood, and then
   click Properties on the menu that appears.

<P><LI>On the Configuration tab, make sure that at least the following network
   components are installed:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Client: Client for Microsoft Networks (if you do not have a Novell
      NetWare server, you do not need to install the Client for NetWare
      networks).
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - Adapter: This should be the network adapter detected by the Add New
      Hardware Wizard.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - Protocol: Choose at least one of the following:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>       - NetBEUI                       Best for small networks where
                                       routing does not take place

       - IPX/SPX-compatible Protocol   Used by Novell NetWare networks;
                                       best for small to large networks
                                       where routing takes place

    - Service: File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks

</PRE><P><LI>Click File And Print Sharing, click the appropriate check boxes to
   select them, and then click OK.

<P><LI>On the Identification tab, enter a name for your computer and your
   workgroup, and then click OK.
<P>
   NOTE: The computer name must be unique for each computer on the network
   and should be no more than 15 characters in length. In small networks,
   the workgroup name should normally be the same for each computer so that
   all computers are visible in the same workgroup when browsing. Avoid
   using spaces and the following characters in computer and workgroup
   names:
<P>
<P><PRE>      / \ * , . " @
</PRE>
<P><LI>Restart your computer when you are prompted to do so.
<P>
</OL>To share network resources, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Double-click My Computer.

<P><LI>Use the right mouse button to click the drive, folder, or printer you
   want to share with members of your network, and then click Sharing on
   the menu that appears.

<P><LI>On the Sharing tab, click Shared As, and then type a name for the share
   in the Share Name box.

<P><LI>Click the access type you want for this shared resource. For a
   description of an access type, use the right mouse button to click the
   access type, and then click What's This? on the menu that appears.

<P><LI>Type a password for the shared resource.
<P>
   NOTE: You do not have to assign a password to a shared resource. A
   password simply gives you additional security.

<P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
</OL>To connect to a shared resource, use one of the following methods:

<UL><LI>Double-click Network Neighborhood, double-click a listed computer to see
   the resources shared by that computer, and then double-click a shared
   resource to view its contents.

<LI>Use the right mouse button to click Network Neighborhood or My Computer,
   click Map Network Drive on the menu that appears, and then enter the
   following line in the Path dialog box:
<P>
<P><PRE>      \\&lt;ComputerName&gt;\&lt;ShareName&gt;
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;ComputerName&gt; is the name of the computer you are connecting to,
   and &lt;ShareName&gt; is the name of the shared resource.

<LI>Click Start, click Run, and then enter the following line in the Open
   box:
<P>
<P><PRE>      \\&lt;ComputerName&gt;\&lt;ShareName&gt;
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;ComputerName&gt; is the name of the computer you are connecting to,
   and &lt;ShareName&gt; is the name of the shared resource.

<LI>Click Start, point to Find, click Computer, and then type the name of
   the computer that you want to locate. When the computer is found,
   double-click the computer name to show the resources shared by that
   computer.
<P>
</UL><h3>Connecting with Dial-Up Adapters</h3>
 
<P>
Dial-Up Networking lets you use your modem to connect to a network through
a remote server.
<P>
For information about connecting to a remote server using Dial-Up
Networking, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../win95x/q145843.htm">Q145843</A></B>
   TITLE     : How to Connect to a Remote Server

</PRE></OL><h3>Connecting with Direct Cable Connection</h3>
 
<P>
You can use Direct Cable Connection to establish a direct serial or
parallel cable connection between two computers. For information about
using Direct Cable Connection, see the "Direct Cable Connection, setting up
a direct cable connection" online Help topic in Windows 95.
<P>
<P><h3>Resource Materials</h3>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Windows 95 Resource Kit contains additional detailed
information about many networking topics. For information about the Windows
95 Resource Kit and other helpful resources, please see the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
