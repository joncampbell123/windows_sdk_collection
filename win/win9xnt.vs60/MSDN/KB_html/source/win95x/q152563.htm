To back up files, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Programs, point to Accessories, point

   NOTE: For information about how to install Backup, please see the
   following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../win95x/q152561.htm">Q152561</A></B>
<PRE></PRE>      TITLE     : How to Install Microsoft Backup

</PRE><P><LI>Click the Backup tab.

<P><LI>Create a backup set. A backup set is an index of the files you plan
   to back up. The first time you run Backup, a Full System Backup
   Set is created. This set includes every file on your hard disk.
<P>
   NOTE: If you have the original installation disks for the programs you
   use, it is usually not necessary to back up your programs. Instead,
   back up only the documents you have created.
<P>
   To create a smaller set of selected files, use the Select Files To
   Backup window. In this window, each drive, folder, and file has a check
   box next to it. If a check appears in a check box, the file, the
   contents of the folder, or the contents of the drive will be backed up.
   If a check appears in a check box with a dark background, some items,
   but not everything, in the folder or drive will be backed up.

<P><LI>Click Next Step.

<P><LI>In the "Select a destination for the backup" window, click the
   destination for the backup.
<P>
   If you have a supported tape backup drive that is detected by Backup,
   it appears at the bottom of the "Select a destination for the backup"
   window. If you do not have a tape drive, or your tape drive is not
   supported or detected, you can select a floppy disk drive or a location
   on your hard disk.
<P>
   NOTE: You can also back up your files to a network drive. The easiest
   way to accomplish this is to map a drive letter to the network
   destination to which you want to back up your files. If you have mapped
   a drive letter to a network drive, Backup displays it in the "Select
   a destination for the backup" window.

<P><LI>Click Start Backup. If you have created a new backup set, you are
   prompted to name the new backup set. Backup informs you when
   the backup operation is finished.
<P>
</OL>To restore files, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Programs, point to Accessories, point
   to System Tools, and then click Backup.

<P><LI>Click the Restore tab.

<P><LI>In the Restore From window, click the drive or folder where the backup
   is stored.

<P><LI>In the Backup Set window, click the backup set you want to restore, and
   then click Next Step.

<P><LI>Click the check boxes of the files you want to restore so that a check
   appears in the check box. Clear the check boxes for files you do not
   want to restore.

<P><LI>Click Start Restore. Backup informs you when the backup operation
   is finished.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: If you receive an error message while you are restoring files,
Backup displays a log showing where the error occurred. For information
about how to troubleshoot this problem, please see the following article
