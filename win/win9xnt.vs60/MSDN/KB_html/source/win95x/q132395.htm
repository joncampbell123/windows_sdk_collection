The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The Wacom pen tablet attached to your computer may not function correctly
after you install Windows 95.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, re-install the software included with the
Wacom pen tablet. For information about other possible resolutions, please
contact Wacom.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If the Wacom pen tablet is the only pointing device installed on the
computer when Windows 95 is installed, the Wacom pen tablet mouse driver
(Wacpen.drv) is not removed from the System.ini file. However, the Wacom
pen tablet VxD (Wacom.386) is renamed to Wacom386.10, and all references
to the original driver name are removed from the System.ini file. The
Wacom.drv file is also renamed to Wacomdrv.10.
<P>
The Pen Extensions for Microsoft Windows (Pen Windows) software version 1.0
is essentially disabled by the installation of Windows 95. You should not
attempt to resolve this problem by configuring the Wacom pen tablet to be
Pen Windows-compatible. The only resolution at this time is to re-install
the software included with the Wacom pen tablet.
