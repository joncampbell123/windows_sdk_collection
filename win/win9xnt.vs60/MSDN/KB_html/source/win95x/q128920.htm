The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Your computer may stop responding (hang) the first time Windows 95 boots
after Setup is finished.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem can occur if all the following conditions exist:

<UL><LI>Your computer has a PCI bus with PCI adapters.

<LI>There is an ISA adapter (for example, a sound card) in your
   computer.

<LI>The ISA adapter was not configured or was not running in real mode
   before you ran Setup.

<LI>You have not changed any of your computer's CMOS settings.
<P>
</UL>If all the above conditions exist, one hardware device in the computer may
be conflicting with another. When this occurs, Windows 95 may hang. For
example, if you have a PCI computer with a PCI video card, PCI SCSI
adapter, and ISA sound card, Setup runs hardware detection and finds the
ISA device. When Setup is finished, your computer is restarted and the
sound card driver is loaded. When Windows 95 enumerates the PCI bus and its
adapters, it finds that the BIOS set the IRQ for one of the PCI devices to
the same IRQ as the sound card, causing the computer to hang.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Use any one of the following methods to resolve this problem:

<UL><LI>Contact your hardware manufacturer for information about how to
   reserve the IRQ for the ISA device in the computer's CMOS settings.
   This prevents the BIOS from assigning the IRQ to another device.

<LI>Remove the ISA device until the computer is completely configured
   to run Windows 95, then re-install the device. After you re-install
   the ISA adapter, run the Add New Hardware Wizard to configure the
   device.

<LI>Press the F8 key when you see the "Starting Windows 95" message,
   then choose Command Prompt Only. After your computer boots,
   configure the hardware and verify that it works correctly.

<LI>If the ISA device is software-configurable, you may be able to assign
   non-conflicting resources using Device Manager. To do so, follow these
   steps:
<P>
   1. Restart your computer. When you see the "Starting Windows 95"
<P><PRE>      message, press the F8 key, then choose Safe Mode from the Startup
      menu.
</PRE><P>
   2. Click the Start button, point to Settings, then click Control Panel.
<P>
   3. Double-click the System icon, then click the Device Manager tab.
<P>
   4. Click the ISA device, then click Properties.
<P>
   5. Click the Original Configuration (Current) check box to clear it,
<P><PRE>      then click OK. Restart Windows 95.
</PRE><P>
   6. If Windows 95 starts and finishes Setup configuration, click the
<P><PRE>      Start button, point to Settings, then click Control Panel.
</PRE><P>
   7. Double-click the System icon, then click the Device Manager tab.
<P>
   8. Click the ISA device, then click Properties.
<P>
   9. Click the Resources tab. On the Resources tab, select a non-
<P><PRE>      conflicting resource for the device if one is available.
