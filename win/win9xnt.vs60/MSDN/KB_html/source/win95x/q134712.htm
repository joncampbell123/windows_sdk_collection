<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the DIR /C or DIR /CH command on a volume that is compressed
with DriveSpace 3.0, a compression ratio may be returned for files that
have not been compressed. The ratio may be as high as 64:1.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The DIR /C command displays the compression ratio of a file, assuming that
the file is located on a drive using 8K clusters. This command returns an
estimated compression ratio for all files, regardless of their compression
status, as if they were compressed on a drive with 8K clusters.
<P>
The DIR /CH command may return a more accurate value if the cluster size
is not 8K, as it references the cluster size of the host partition for its
estimates. However, this command also returns an estimated compression
ratio for all files saved to the drive.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95 installs DriveSpace 3.0 and System Agent by
default unless you choose not to.
<P>
You can save uncompressed files to a compressed volume when the No
Compression option is selected for the drive.
<P>
You can configure the Compression Agent with System Agent to compress the
files at a later time. This configuration maximizes system performance by
delaying the compression of files written to the drive until the computer
is idle.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem with Microsoft Plus! for
Windows 95. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
