<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The system clock on a Windows 95-based computer may experience a
cumulative loss of time.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When you run the Date/Time tool in Control Panel, the computer's real-time
clock (RTC) is updated using the MS-DOS system time. Because the RTC is
being updated by a device that is less accurate, a cumulative loss of time
can occur over a period of time.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this behavior, use either of the following methods:

<UL><LI>Do not use the Date/Time tool in Control Panel or double-click the time
   in the taskbar to change the date or time. Instead, use the TIME or
   DATE command at a command prompt to change the time or date.

<LI>Rename the Timedate.cpl file in the Windows\System folder. This removes
   the Date/Time tool from Control Panel, but does not prevent the time
   from being displayed in the taskbar.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The MS-DOS system time is accurate to 1/18 of a second. Each time you use
the Date/Time tool, an incorrect time is written to the computer's RTC.
The amount of time lost depends on how often the Date/Time tool is opened
and the amount of time since it was last opened.
<P>
For standalone computers, this may not be much of a problem. However, with
network programs that rely upon time and date stamps to ensure the proper
file is accessed, this can cause problems over a period of time.
