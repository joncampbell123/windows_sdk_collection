The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you try to dial a 10-digit number (the telephone number plus the
area code), Windows ignores the area code specified if it matches your
local area code.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Windows is designed to conform to the North American Dialing Standard.
This standard requires you to dial a one, plus the area code and the
telephone number for all long-distance numbers. If the telephone number is
a local call, you do not need to dial the area code.
<P>
Some regional telephone companies use area code overlays that require you
to dial the area code plus the telephone number for all calls. If it is a
long-distance call, you must precede this number with a one. Windows is
not designed to comply with this 10-digit dialing scheme.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
There are three methods for working around this issue.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1</h3>
 
<P>
You can create your own dialing rules in the Dialing properties. Use the
following steps to create a custom calling card that dials all local calls
with 10 digits.
<P>
Windows95:

<OL><P><LI>Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

<P><LI>Double-click Modems, and then click Dialing Properties.

<P><LI>Click the Dial Using Calling Card check box to select it, and then click
   Change.

<P><LI>Click New.

<P><LI>Type a name for the calling card (for example, Direct Dial), click OK,
   and then click OK again.

<P><LI>Click Advanced, and then fill out the dialing rules as follows:
<P>
<PRE>      Field                             Dialing Rule
      ----------------------------------------------
      Calls Within The Same Area Code   FG
      Long Distance Calls               1FG
      International Calls               011EFG

   NOTE: To see information about valid entries for each field, right-click
   the field names and then click "What's This?" For example, an entry of 
   FG means to dial the area code and the local number.

</PRE><P><LI>Click Close, and then click OK.
<P>
</OL>Windows NT:

<OL><P><LI>Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

<P><LI>Double-click Modems, and then Dialing Properties.

<P><LI>Click the Dial Using Calling Card check box to select it, and then click
   Change.

<P><LI>Click New.

<P><LI>Type a name for the calling card (for example, Direct Dial), click OK,
   and then click OK again.

<P><LI>In the Dialing Rules dialog box type in the dialing rules as follows:
<P>
<PRE>      Field                             Dialing Rule
      ----------------------------------------------
      Calls Within The Same Area Code   FG
      Long Distance Calls               1FG
      International Calls               011EFG

   NOTE: To see information about valid entries for each field, right-click
   the field names and then click "What's This?" For example, an entry of 
   FG means to dial the area code and the local number.

</PRE><P><LI>Click Close, and then click OK.
<P>
</OL>This method causes Windows to dial all telephone numbers with the same
area code as your own with 10 digits. When you use this method, Dialing
properties (such as call waiting or outside line access numbers) are used.
<P>
You can use this method with HyperTerminal, Dial-Up Networking, and The
Microsoft Network.
<P>
You can also use this method with Microsoft Schedule+, but you must also
create a new location that uses the custom calling card. To switch between
regular dialing and 10-digit dialing, click Dialing Properties in the
Modems tool in Control Panel and then select the appropriate location in
the I Am Dialing From box.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 2</h3>
 
<P>
Windows does not limit the number of digits you can enter in the Phone
Number box. You can, therefore, set the area code to match your local area
code and you can enter the 10-digit telephone number to dial in the Phone
Number box.
<P>
For example, if your local area code is 111, you can enter 111 in the Area
Code box and a phone number such as 555 123-4567 in the Phone Number
box. Windows will dial this phone number using all 10 digits.
<P>
To change the area code in Windows, use the following steps:
<P>
Windows 95:

<OL><P><LI>Click Start, point to Programs, point to Accessories, and then click
   Dial-Up Networking.

<P><LI>Click the connection, and then click Properties on the File menu.

<P><LI>Click the "Use Country Code and Area Code" check box to select it, and
   then type the area code and phone number.
<P>
</OL>Windows NT:

<OL><P><LI>Double-click My Computer, and then double-click Dial-Up Networking.

<P><LI>In the Phonebook Entry To Dial box, click the appropriate connection.

<P><LI>Click More, and then click "Edit Entry and Modem Properties."

<P><LI>Click the Use Telephony Dialing Properties check box to select it, and
   then type the area code and phone number.
<P>
</OL>When you use this method, Dialing properties (such as call waiting or
outside line access numbers) are used. You can use this method with
HyperTerminal, Dial-Up Networking, The Microsoft Network, and Microsoft
Fax.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 3</h3>
 
<P>
You can click the "Use country code and area code" check box in Windows 95
or the "Use Telephony Dialing Properties" check box in Windows NT to clear
it, to make Windows dial the number you enter in the Phone Number box
exactly as you enter it. Dialing properties (such as call waiting and
outside line access numbers) are not applied.
<P>
For example, if your local area code is 111, click Modify beside the Phone
Number box, and then click the "Use country code and area code" check box
to clear it. If you must dial a 9 to gain an outside line, you would type
"9 555 123-4567" (without quotation marks) in the Phone Number box.
<P>
When you use this method you must enter every digit that is to be dialed in
the Phone Number box. The digits are not automatically adapted as you
change locations, but you have complete control over the number that is
dialed.
<P>
You can use this method with HyperTerminal, Dial-Up Networking, and The
Microsoft Network.
