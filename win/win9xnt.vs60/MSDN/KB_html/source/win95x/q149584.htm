The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
<LI>Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.22
</UL> 
<P>
This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft
DriveSpace. For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for
commands and file names.
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you upgrade to Windows 95 on a computer with a compressed drive C, and
then uncompress drive C in Windows 95, you may lose access to all other
compressed drives if you later remove (uninstall) Windows 95.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When the uninstall information was saved, the real-mode compression driver
and other MS-DOS system files were located on the host drive for compress-
ed drive C. Because drive C is no longer compressed when you remove
Windows 95, the host drive is no longer available and the real-mode
compression driver cannot be restored. Therefore, any remaining compressed
drives are not mounted and cannot be accessed.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, create a small new DoubleSpace drive and then
delete it. This creates a Dblspace.ini file and loads Dblspace.bin into
memory so that you can mount the remaining compressed drives. For
information about how to do so, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : Using Compressed Floppy Disks without a Compressed Hard Disk

</PRE>After the new compressed drive is created, you can use DoubleSpace to
mount any other compressed drives on your computer.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Even if you choose to save your existing system files during Windows 95
Setup, you may be unable to successfully remove Windows 95 if your system
configuration has changed significantly since the uninstall information
was saved.
