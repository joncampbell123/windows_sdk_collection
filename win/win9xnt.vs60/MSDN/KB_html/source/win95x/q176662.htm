The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it
if a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the
"Restoring the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a
Registry  Key" Help topic in Regedt32.exe.
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you select the Tool Box, Color Box, or Show Thumbnail tool in Paint,
the tool may not appear on the screen.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior can occur when the screen resolution is reduced, causing the
Tool Box, Color Box, or Show Thumbnail tool to be positioned off of the
screen.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this issue, use one of the following methods. Try method 1
first. If you cannot increase your screen resolution, use method 2.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1</h3>
 
<P>
Increase the screen resolution. To do so, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

<P><LI>Double-click Display, and then click the Settings tab.

<P><LI>Move the Desktop Area slider to the right, and then click OK.
<P>
   NOTE: Your monitor and display adapter determine whether you can change
   your screen resolution. To increase the screen resolution when the
   monitor type is unknown, you may need to specify a monitor if you are
   prompted:
<P>
<P><PRE>      You have not specified what type of monitor you use. Your new
      settings may not work correctly. Do you want to specify a monitor
      now?
</PRE>
<P><LI>Click Yes, and then click OK.

<P><LI>If you still cannot view the Tool Box, Color Box, or Show Thumbnail
   tool, repeat steps 1-3 to further increase the screen resolution.

<P><LI>When you can view the Tool Box, Color Box, or Show Thumbnail tool, move
   the tool closer to the upper-left corner of the screen, and then reduce
   the screen resolution to your preferred setting.
<P>
</OL><h3>Method 2</h3>
 
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry
Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys
And Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and
Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics
in Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit
it.
<P>
NOTE: If you use this method, any customizations that you previously made
for Paint are reset to the default settings.

<OL><P><LI>Quit Paint.

<P><LI>Use Registry Editor to delete the Paint key in the following registry
   key:
<P>
<P><PRE>      HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Applets
</PRE>
<P><LI>Quit Registry Editor.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior can occur if you move the Tool Box, Color Box, or Show
Thumbnail tool to the edge of the screen, quit Paint, and then reduce the
screen resolution before you start Paint again. This causes the tool to be
positioned off of the visible portion of the screen.
<P>
To select the Tool Box or Color Box tool, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click Start, point to Programs, point to Accessories, and then click
   Paint.

<P><LI>On the View menu, click Tool Box or Color Box.
<P>
</OL>To select the Show Thumbnail tool, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click Start, point to Programs, point to Accessories, and then click
   Paint.

<P><LI>On the View menu, click Zoom, and then click Large Size or Custom.

<P><LI>On the View menu, click Zoom, and then click Show Thumbnail.
<P>
</OL>When you zoom in on a picture with the Large Size or Custom setting
enabled and the Thumbnail tool selected, a separate smaller window
displays a full view of the magnified picture.
