<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article contains a copy of the information in the Readme.txt file
included with the Windows 95 Support Assistant.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Windows 95 Support Assistant</h3>
 
<P>
The Windows 95 Support Assistant version 1.0a was originally released to
some Windows 95 Beta testers as the Windows 95 Care Package. The Support
Assistant boasts a new look and much more content.
<P>
When you install the Support Assistant in Windows 95, it uses the online
Help search engine in Windows 95 to let you navigate among topics easily.
<P>
<P><h3>The Support Assistant Files</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>Assist.cnt   - The Support Assistant Help contents file. This file
</PRE>allows the use of the Windows 95 Contents page.
<PRE>Assist.hlp   - The main Support Assistant Help file. This is the only
</PRE>file required for use in Windows 3.x and Windows for
Workgroups 3.1x.
<PRE>Assist.ico   - Icon for the Support Assistant.
Hcl.hlp      - Windows 95 Hardware Compatibility List.  This file is
</PRE>produced by the Windows 95 Development Team.
<PRE>Readme.txt   - This file.
</PRE>Win95app.hlp - Windows 95 Application Compatibility List.  This file is
produced by the Windows 95 Development Team.
<P>
<P><h3>Installation Notes</h3>
 
<P>
Windows 95:
<P>
When you install the Support Assistant in the Windows\HELP folder, you can
easily jump or switch to other online Help files. If you specify a
different folder you may receive the following error message when you jump
to a different Help file topic:
<P>
Cannot find the Windows.hlp file
<P>
If a program or driver replaces a Windows 95 Help file you may encounter
problems when you jump to another Help file topic. For example the text of
the topic may be incorrect or the topic may not exist. Both the Microsoft
IntelliPoint software version 2.0 and the Microsoft IntelliType software
version 1.1 replace Windows 95 Help files.
<P>
Windows 3.1 and Windows for Workgroups:
<P>
The Support Assistant installs files in a folder called Assist. If you try
to jump to a Windows 95 Help topic you may receive one of the following
error messages:

<UL><LI>Topic not found
<P>
 -or-

<LI>Cannot open Help file
<P></UL>
