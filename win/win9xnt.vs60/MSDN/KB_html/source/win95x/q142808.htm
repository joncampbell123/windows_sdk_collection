The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you try to change your Windows password by double-clicking the
Passwords icon in Control Panel and then clicking Change Windows Password,
you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   The password-list file %1 is damaged. You need to delete it and
   create a new one. Do you want to delete the damaged file now?

</PRE>When you click OK, the damaged password list (.pwl) file may not be
deleted. The next time you try to change your password, you receive the
same error message.
<P>
Note that this problem does not affect your ability to log on to a
Microsoft Windows NT or Novell NetWare server.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The .pwl file in your Windows folder is damaged, and Windows 95 cannot
delete the file.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Rename the damaged .pwl file. To do so, type the following line at
   a command prompt, and then press ENTER
<P>
<P><PRE>      ren c:\&lt;windows&gt;\&lt;username&gt;.pwl c:\&lt;windows&gt;\&lt;username&gt;.xxx
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;windows&gt; is the name of your Windows folder and &lt;username&gt; is
   the user name you use to log on to Windows 95.

<P><LI>Restart your computer.

<P><LI>When the Enter Network Password or Welcome To Windows dialog box
   appears, type the password that you normally use, and then click OK.
   When you are prompted to confirm the password that you entered, type
   the password again in the Confirm New Password box, and then click OK.
<P>
</OL>If the Microsoft Client for Microsoft Networks or the Microsoft Client for
NetWare Networks is your primary network client, the above steps cause your
Windows password to be the same as your network password. After you perform
these steps you can change your Windows password as you normally do. To do
so, double-click the Passwords icon in Control Panel, and then click Change
Windows Password.
