<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article lists games (R-Z) that must be run in MS-DOS mode. Additional
information is provided when available.
<P>
For information about running games in MS-DOS mode, please see the "Running
an Application in MS-DOS Mode" section later in this article.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Realms of Arkania - Blade of Destiny by Sir-Tech</h3>
 
<P>
Executable: BLADE.BAT, BLADEM.EXE
<P>
Realms of Arkania attempts to calibrate the computer in a manner not
compatible with Windows 95. Running it in MS-DOS mode allows the
calibration to succeed.
<P>
NOTE: The calibration problem occurs only in the program title sequence. To
skip the title sequence, double-click the BLADEM.EXE program icon instead
of BLADE.BAT. This avoids the calibration problem and allow the program to
run in Windows 95 without requiring MS-DOS mode.
<P>
<P><h3>Rebel Assault by Lucas Arts</h3>
 
<P>
Rebel Assault may require MS-DOS mode on some computers, particularly 386-
based computers or computers with less than 8 MB of RAM. Rebel Assault
cannot play sound on a ProAudio Spectrum 16 sound card unless it is using
an 8-bit DMA channel.
<P>
<P><h3>Relentless Twinsen's Adventure by Electronic Arts</h3>
 
<P>
Executable: RELENT.EXE
<P>
Relentless Twinsen's Adventure makes incorrect assumptions about the system
memory configuration when Windows 95 is running. It must be run in MS-DOS
mode.
<P>
<P><h3>Return to Zork by ActiVision</h3>
 
<P>
Although you can install Return to Zork in Windows 95, it runs only in
MS-DOS mode. If you receive error messages on a blue background while
installing Return to Zork, ignore them.
<P>
<P><h3>Rise of the Robots by Time Warner Interactive</h3>
 
<P>
Executable: RISE.EXE
<P>
Rise of the Robots has a problem in its timing code that causes it to pause
for long periods of time under certain conditions. The problems may be
resolved in MS-DOS mode.
<P>
<P><h3>Robinson's Requiem by Ready Soft</h3>
 
<P>
Executable: START.EXE
<P>
Robinson's Requiem has a problem in its timing code that causes it to stop
responding (hang). There are also problems with the MS-DOS extender used by
the program.
<P>
<P><h3>Rodney's Funscreen by ActiVision</h3>
 
<P>
Executables: RODNEY.BAT, RODNEY.EXE
<P>
The MS-DOS-based version of Rodney's Funscreen is unable to play sounds in
Windows 95. Note that there is a Windows-based version of the program, in
the same package, that works fine.
<P>
<P><h3>Sabre</h3>
 
<P>
Executable: SABRE.EXE
<P>
Sabre requires MS-DOS mode.
<P>
<P><h3>Sam 'n Max Hit the Road by Lucas Arts</h3>
 
<P>
Sam 'n Max Hit the Road may require MS-DOS mode on some computers. On
others, it may run but with degraded sound quality. If you experience
problems, run Sam 'n Max Hit the Road in MS-DOS mode.
<P>
<P><h3>Secret Weapons of the Luftwaffe by Lucas Arts</h3>
 
<P>
The CD-ROM version of Secret Weapons of the Luftwaffe experiences problems
in Windows 95. You may be able to avoid these problems in MS-DOS mode.
<P>
The floppy disk version appears to run in Windows 95  without any problems.
<P>
<P><h3>Shadowcaster by Origin</h3>
 
<P>
If you have a computer without a math coprocessor, you must run
Shadowcaster in MS-DOS mode.
<P>
<P><h3>Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective by ICOM Simulations</h3>
 
<P>
Sherlock Holmes requires MS-DOS mode.
<P>
<P><h3>SimCity Classic by Maxis</h3>
 
<P>
SimCity requires MS-DOS mode.
<P>
<P><h3>SimHealth by Maxis</h3>
 
<P>
Executable: HEALTH.EXE
<P>
The MS-DOS extender used by SimHealth is not compatible with Windows 95. It
must be run in MS-DOS mode.
<P>
<P><h3>SimLife by Maxis</h3>
 
<P>
Executable: SIMLIFE.BAT
<P>
SimLife requires MS-DOS mode.
<P>

message, then choose Safe Mode Command Prompt Only from the Startup menu.
<P>
<P><h3>Simon the Sorcerer by Infocom</h3>
 
<P>
Simon the Sorcerer requires MS-DOS mode.
<P>
<P><h3>Slam City with Scottie Pippen by Digital Pictures</h3>
 
<P>
Executable: SLAM.EXE
<P>
When you run Slam City for the first time it causes a fault in the MS-DOS
extender. The fault occurs because Slam City encounters a problem when it
attempts to determine the proper settings for your sound card. A file
called SLAMTEMP.$$$ is created in the root directory to record the problem.
Do not delete this file.
<P>
When you run Slam City a second time, it should detect that the previous
attempt to detect the sound card failed and display an appropriate message.
<P>
It may be necessary to restart your computer after you choose the sound
card for sounds to play properly. Depending on your sound card, sound may
not work even after you restart the computer. If this occurs, run Slam City
in MS-DOS mode.
<P>
<P><h3>Sound Configuration Utility by Dynamix (Sierra Online)</h3>
 
<P>
Executable: SOUNDSET.EXE
<P>
This configuration program is used by many Dynamix games. This program
accesses memory after freeing it. Windows 95 memory protection terminates
the program due to an invalid operation. Run the program in MS-DOS mode to
avoid the problem.
<P>
<P><h3>Space Adventure II by Knowledge Adventure</h3>
 
<P>
Space Adventure II requires MS-DOS mode.
<P>
<P><h3>Speed Racer by Accolade</h3>
 
<P>
Executable: SR.BAT
<P>
When you exit Speed Racer, you receive an error message. The error message
occurs because Speed Racer accesses memory after freeing it. Windows 95
memory protection terminates the program due to an invalid operation. Run
Speed Racer in MS-DOS mode to avoid the problem.
<P>
<P><h3>Stalingrad by Avalon Hill</h3>
 
<P>
Executable: STALIN.EXE
<P>

<P>
<P><h3>Star Crusader by GameTek</h3>
 
<P>
Executable: SC.COM
<P>
Star Crusader (which comes pre-installed on some Leading Edge computers)
runs poorly in Windows 95. It runs better in MS-DOS mode.
<P>
<P><h3>Strike Commander by Origin</h3>
 
<P>
Executables: SC.EXE, SCCD.EXE
<P>
When you run Strike Commander you receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Protected mode driver is not responding to EMS function calls. Make sure
   your EMS driver is not configured with the NOEMS option. If it is,
   replace the option "NOEMS" with "RAM."

</PRE>This error is misleading as Strike Commander is really asking for Virtual
Control Program Interface (VCPI) services, not EMS memory. Windows 95 does
not support VCPI services, so you must run Strike Commander in MS-DOS mode.
<P>
<P><h3>Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo by GameTek</h3>
 
<P>
Executable: SSF2T.BAT
<P>
Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo is not compatible with Win32. It must be run
in MS-DOS mode.
<P>
NOTE: This program does not run if you have a BLASTER environment variable
with no "T" attribute. Please contact GameTek for instructions on including
an appropriate "T" value in the BLASTER environment variable before running
Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo.
<P>
<P><h3>Syndicate (and add-ons) by Electronic Arts</h3>
 
<P>
Executables: SYND.BAT, SYND.EXE
<P>
When you run Syndicate or any of its add-ons in Windows 95, you receive the
following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   DOS/16M error: [31] protected mode already in use in this DPMI virtual
   machine

</PRE>Syndicate requires complete control of the computer and must be run in
MS-DOS mode.
<P>
<P><h3>System Shock by Origin</h3>
 
<P>
Executables: SSHOCK.BAT, SSHOCK.EXE
<P>
System Shock has trouble reading the joystick if run from a Windows 95
MS-DOS prompt. Either disable the joystick feature, or run System Shock in
MS-DOS mode.
<P>
<P><h3>The Treehouse by Broderbund</h3>
 
<P>
If you have more than 500K of free conventional memory, you can run The
Treehouse in Windows 95. Otherwise, you must run The Treehouse in MS-DOS
mode.
<P>
<P><h3>Trump Castle 3 by Capstone</h3>
 
<P>
Executable: TC3.EXE
<P>
Trump Castle sets the timer rate to a speed faster than it can handle.
Running it in MS-DOS mode may resolve the problem.
<P>
<P><h3>Ultima VII - The Black Gate by Origin</h3>
 
<P>
Executable: ULTIMA7.COM
<P>
The Black Gate requires MS-DOS mode.
<P>
<P><h3>Ultima VII - Part II - Serpent Isle by Origin</h3>
 
<P>
Executable: SERPENT.COM
<P>
Ultima VII - Serpent Isle refuses to run in a protected-mode operating
system. It must be run in MS-DOS mode.
<P>
To run Serpent Isle in MS-DOS mode, you must specify a new MS-DOS
configuration. The following sample CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files may
work. If they do not, please contact Origin for assistance.
<P>
<PRE>   CONFIG.SYS:

   Files=25
   Buffers=25 (per Origin, PS/2 users should use Files &amp; Buffers of 50)

   AUTOEXEC.BAT:

   Path=&lt;Windows folder&gt;;&lt;Windows\Command folder&gt;;&lt;Serpent Isle folder&gt;
   C:\&lt;Path to mouse driver&gt;

</PRE>Note that Origin recommends that you not run Serpent Isle with any disk
compression.
<P>
<P><h3>Ultima VIII - Pagan by Origin</h3>
 
<P>
Executable: U8.EXE
<P>
Pagan requires MS-DOS mode.
<P>
<P><h3>Ultimate Football by Microprose</h3>
 
<P>
Executables: FOOTBALL.BAT, FOOTBALL.EXE
<P>
Ultimate Football requires MS-DOS mode.
<P>
<P><h3>Ultrabots by Electronic Arts</h3>
 
<P>
Ultrabots sets the timer rate to a speed too fast for Windows 95 to handle
comfortably. It runs, although slowly. Running Ultrabots in MS-DOS mode
allows it to run at full speed.
<P>
<P><h3>Under a Killing Moon by Access Software</h3>
 
<P>
Executable: MOON.EXE
<P>
Under a Killing Moon uses the sound card in a way that is not compatible
with Windows 95. If you disable sound support for the game, it may run in
Windows 95. Otherwise, you must run and install Under a Killing Moon in
MS-DOS mode.
<P>
<P><h3>US Navy Fighters by Electronic Arts</h3>
 
<P>
Executable: USNF.EXE
<P>
US Navy Fighters makes incorrect assumptions about the system memory
configuration when Windows 95 is running; therefore, it must be run in
MS-DOS mode.
<P>
<P><h3>Wing Commander II by Origin</h3>
 
<P>
Executable: WC2.BAT
<P>
Wing Commander manipulates expanded (EMS) memory in a manner incompatible
with Windows 95. It must be run in MS-DOS mode.
<P>
<P><h3>Wing Commander II - Special Operations Disk by Origin</h3>
 
<P>
Executables: SO1.BAT, SO2.BAT, SO1.EXE, SO2.EXE
<P>
This add-on to Wing Commander II manipulates expanded (EMS) memory in a
manner incompatible with Windows 95. It must be run in MS-DOS mode.
<P>
<P><h3>Wing Commander Armada by Origin</h3>
 
<P>

<P>
<P><h3>World Atlas version 4 by Software Toolworks</h3>
 
<P>
Executable: WA.BAT
<P>
World Atlas is unable to play sounds when run at a Windows 95 MS-DOS prompt
due to the way it uses the system timer. To work around this problem,
disable the sound in World Atlas or run it in MS-DOS mode.
<P>
<P><h3>World of Xeen - Might and Magic by New World Computing</h3>
 
<P>
World of Xeen requires MS-DOS mode.
<P>
<P><h3>Zephyr by New World Computing</h3>
 
<P>
Executable: ZEPHYR.EXE
<P>
Zephyr requires MS-DOS mode.
<P>
<P><h3>Running an Application in MS-DOS Mode</h3>
 
<P>
Windows 95 usually runs programs that require MS-DOS mode in MS-DOS mode
automatically. If it does not, delete the corresponding .PIF file and
double-click the program icon again. Note that .PIF files usually have the
same name as the program file, but with a .PIF extension instead of the
.BAT, .COM, or .EXE extension. The corresponding .PIF file can be found in
one of the following locations:

<UL><LI>In the folder that contains the program file.

<LI>In the hidden PIF folder in the Windows 95 folder.

<LI>In a folder specified by your PATH statement.
<P>
</UL>To make certain you find all copies of the .PIF file, use the Find Files
Or Folders feature.
<P>
If Windows 95 does not configure the program to run in MS-DOS mode
automatically, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click the executable file with the right mouse button, then click
   Properties on the menu that appears.

<P><LI>On the Program tab, click the Advanced button.

<P><LI>Click the MS-DOS Mode check box to select it.

<P><LI>You can usually use the Use Current MS-DOS Configuration option.
   However, some programs may require that you use the Specify A New
   Configuration option. Consult the program's documentation for sample
   CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files.

<P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
</OL>These steps cause the program to run in MS-DOS mode. You may need to
optimize the settings if the program requires a mouse, expanded memory, a
CD-ROM drive, or a sound card. Consult the program's documentation to
determine if it has specific needs.
<P>
NOTE: You may have to double-click the program icon in Windows Explorer or
My Computer, or type the program name in the Run dialog box, for the
program's settings to take effect. Typing the program name at an MS-DOS
prompt does not always cause the program's settings to be used.
