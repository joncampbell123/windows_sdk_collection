<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
<LI>Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After you upgrade to Windows 95 and you install or try to use a Winsock
program, the program may not run, or you may receive the following error
message when you try to run the program:
<P>
<PRE>   The following system files have been replaced with older versions by a
   program you recently ran. These files are currently in use and cannot
   be automatically repaired. Windows may not run properly until you exit
   and restart Windows so that these files can be automatically repaired.

      C:\Windows\Winsock.dll

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When you install Dial-Up Networking, TCP/IP, or the IPX/SPX-compatible
protocol in Windows 95, Setup renames the existing Winsock.dll file to
Winsock.old and installs a new suite of Windows Sockets 1.1 interface
files.
<P>
Current Winsock programs may not be compatible with the Windows 95
Winsock.dll file due to proprietary services in the program's version of
the file. Windows 95 is not compatible with older versions of Winsock.dll.
<P>
If the program you try to run is not compatible with the installed version
of the Winsock.dll file, you may receive an error message or the program
may not run.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this issue, use any one of the following methods:

<UL><LI>Connect to your Internet service provider using Dial-Up Networking.
   Dial-Up Networking provides support for 16-bit and 32-bit Windows
   Sockets programs.
<P>
   For additional information about using Dial-Up Networking, view the
   "Connecting to a network by using Dial-Up Networking" topic in Windows
   95 Help or see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../win95x/q138789.htm">Q138789</A></B>
<PRE></PRE>      TITLE     : How to Connect to the Internet in Windows 95

</PRE><LI>You may be able to use both your current Winsock program and Windows 95
   Winsock programs by following these steps:
<P>
   1. Copy the Winsock.old file from the Windows folder or the
<P><PRE>      Windows\System folder to the folder containing the program's
      executable file.
</PRE><P>
   2. Rename the Winsock.old file in its new folder to Winsock.dll.

<LI>Contact the manufacturer of the Winsock program to inquire about a
   possible update.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following Winsock programs may work if you place their version of the
Winsock.dll file in the program's folder:

<UL><LI>Chameleon
<LI>CompuServe Internet Dialer or CompuServe Net Launcher
<LI>FTP Software
<LI>Internet In a Box
<LI>Internet Office
<LI>Mosaic In a Box
