The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
<LI>Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you are using a real-mode driver (DRVSPACE.BIN or DBLSPACE.BIN) and
you try to access a file on a DriveSpace or DoubleSpace compressed drive,
the computer stops responding (hangs).
<P>
If you are using a protected-mode driver (DRVSPACX.VXD), you receive the
error message "Read Fault."
<P>
To determine whether you are using a real-mode or protected-mode driver,
run DRVSPACE.EXE and click About DriveSpace on the Help menu.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The file that you are trying to access is stored in one or more bad
clusters. A bad cluster on a compressed drive is a cluster that cannot be
read successfully. Note that an unreadable cluster on a compressed drive
does not always indicate a media defect on the physical surface of the
disk.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
With the protected-mode DriveSpace driver loaded, run ScanDisk for Windows
and click the Thorough option button in the Type Of Test box. Test both
the system and data areas on the compressed drive, as well as on the host
drive. To run ScanDisk and perform a thorough test, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Programs, point to Accessories, point
   to System Tools, then click ScanDisk.

<P><LI>Click the drives you want to test (you should test both the compressed
   drive and the host drive).

<P><LI>In the Type Of Test box, click the Thorough option button.

<P><LI>Click the Options button.

<P><LI>Click the System And Data Areas option button.

<P><LI>Click the OK button.

<P><LI>Click the Start button.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Bad cluster markings due to physical media defects should appear only
on uncompressed drives. If ScanDisk is unable to read a cluster on a
DriveSpace compressed drive, ScanDisk erases the Microsoft DriveSpace
FAT (MDFAT) entry for that cluster and changes the portion of the file
that was using the cluster to 0 bytes in length. The physical sectors
previously used by the unreadable cluster are marked as free and can be
used again.
