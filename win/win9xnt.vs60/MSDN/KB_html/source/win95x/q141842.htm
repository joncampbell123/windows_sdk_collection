<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After you install Sigma Designs' ReelMagic (also called RealMagic)
drivers, the system startup sound is played repeatedly when you restart
your computer. If you open the Sounds tool in Control Panel and play a
wave (.wav) file, the sound is played repeatedly.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Sigma Designs' software looks for an "Int=" line in the [Sound] section
of the Fmpdrv.ini file in the folder in which you installed the
ReelMagic software. If this line is not present, the software defaults
the audio IRQ setting to 5, instead of using the IRQ setting you may
have specified. Note that the "Interrupt=" line in the Fmpdrv.ini file
is not used to set the interrupt.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Use any text editor (such as Notepad) to edit the Fmpdrv.ini file and
add the line
<P>
<PRE>   Int=&lt;x&gt;

</PRE>to the [Sound] section of the file, where &lt;x&gt; is an available interrupt,
and then restart your computer.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The ReelMagic board is manufactured by Sigma Designs, a vendor
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise,
regarding this product's performance or reliability.
