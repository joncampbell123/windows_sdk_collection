<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Backup program included with Windows 95 cannot restore files that
were backed up with an earlier version of Backup (such as the versions
of Backup included with MS-DOS versions 5.0 and 6.x). To restore backups
created with earlier versions of Backup, you must use the Restore.exe or
Msbackup.exe program located on the Windows 95 CD-ROM.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
NOTE: Before you use the Restore.exe or Msbackup.exe program on the
Windows 95 CD-ROM, please read the Lfnbk.txt file in the Admin\
Apptools\Lfnback folder on the Windows 95 CD-ROM, or see the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : Using Hard Disk Utilities with Windows 95

</PRE><h3>Backups Made Using MS-DOS 5.0</h3>
 
<P>
To restore a backup created with the Backup program included with MS-DOS
5.0, use the Restore.exe program located in the Other\Oldmsdos folder on
the Windows 95 CD-ROM. To run this program, copy it to a folder on your
hard disk, and then run it from a command prompt, making sure to use the
appropriate syntax. For information about the syntax for the Restore.exe
program, type the following line:
<P>
<PRE>   restore /?

</PRE>If you receive the error message "Incorrect DOS version" when you try to
run Restore.exe, type the following line to modify the version table:
<P>
<PRE>   setver restore.exe 6.22

</PRE>After you type this line, restart your computer, and then try to run
Restore.exe again.
<P>
<P><h3>Backups Made Using MS-DOS 6.x</h3>
 
<P>
To restore a backup created with the backup programs included with MS-DOS
6.x, use the Msbackup.exe program located in the Other\Oldmsdos\Msbackup
folder on the Windows 95 CD-ROM. To run this program, copy all the files
from the folder on the Windows 95 CD-ROM to a folder on your hard disk.
Double-click the Msbackup.exe file in Windows Explorer to start it. For
information about using the Msbackup.exe program, start the program, and
then click Restore on the Help menu.
