<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you are viewing the General tab in System properties, a Cyrix 5x86
or 6x86 CPU is reported as a 486 CPU. In Windows 95 OEM Service Release 2
(OSR2), the processor is reported as "CyrixInstead."
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Cyrix CPUs were developed and released after the algorithm used by
Windows 95 to detect CPUs was finished. Windows 95 does not have the
information necessary to recognize the chip. NexGen and other non-Intel
chips may be reported in a similar manner. OSR2 recognizes most non-Intel
CPUs. This does not affect the processing power of the CPU while running
Windows 95.
<P>
Some programs (mostly games) look for a Pentium CPU and may report that
you must have a Pentium-class CPU in order to run the program. Many of
these programs will operate normally despite this error message. Contact
the program's manufacturer for a possible resolution if you encounter
problems trying to run any program that requires a Pentium processor.
<P>
This behavior also occurs in the Registration Wizard.
