The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
<LI>Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you dial in to a Windows 95 Dial-Up Networking Server that is connected
to a local area network (LAN) using only the IPX protocol and you try to
access a network resource on a computer other than the Dial-Up Networking
Server, you may receive one of the following error messages:

<UL><LI>The network name cannot be found

<LI>The computer or sharename could not be found
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior can occur if the network address for the IPX protocol is
set to zero. IPX packets cannot be routed to a network with an address of
zero.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To access network resources on a computer other than the Dial-Up
Networking Server, use one of the following methods:

<UL><LI>Install the NetBEUI protocol on all computers, including the Dial-Up
   Networking Server and the client computer. To do so, follow these
   steps:
<P>
   1. In Control Panel, double-click Network.
<P>
   2. Click Add, click Protocol, and then click Add.
<P>
   3. Click Microsoft in the Manufacturers box, click NetBEUI in the
<P><PRE>      Network Protocols box, and then click OK.
</PRE>
<LI>Set the network address in the IPX protocol's properties to something
   other than zero. Follow these steps on all computers, including the
   Dial-Up Networking Server and the client computer:
<P>
   1. In Control Panel, double-click Network.
<P>
   2. Click the IPX/SPX-compatible network protocol bound to the LAN
<P><PRE>      adapter, and then click Properties.
</PRE><P>
   3. On the Advanced tab, click Network Address, change the value to
<P><PRE>      a number greater than zero, and then click OK.
</PRE><P>
</UL>NOTE: Whichever method you choose, the steps must be performed on every
computer on the LAN, including the Dial-Up Networking Server.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Windows 95 sets the network address for the IPX protocol to zero by
default. When a Dial-Up Networking connection tries to view or connect to
a resource, the IPX packets are not routed because they cannot be routed
to a network with a network address value of 0.
