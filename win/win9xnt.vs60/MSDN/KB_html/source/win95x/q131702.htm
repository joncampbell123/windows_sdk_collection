<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
You may not be able to delete, move, open, or otherwise access a file or
folder. In Windows Explorer, some of the characters in the name of the file
or folder are replaced with underscore characters (_). In addition, you may
experience one or more of the following symptoms:

<UL><LI>When you try to open a file in WordPad, you receive the following error
   message:
<P>
<P><PRE>      &lt;filename&gt;
      This file cannot be found.
      Make sure that the correct path and filename are given.
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;filename&gt; is the filename displayed in Windows Explorer, not the
   actual filename.

<LI>When you try to delete a file in Windows Explorer or drag a file to
   the Recycle Bin, you receive the following error message
<P>
<P><PRE>      Cannot delete &lt;filename&gt;: Cannot find the specified file.
      Make sure you specify the correct path and filename.
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;filename&gt; is the filename displayed in Windows Explorer, not
   the actual filename.

<LI>When you double-click a folder in Windows Explorer, you receive the
   following error message
<P>
<P><PRE>      The folder '&lt;foldername&gt;' does not exist.
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;foldername&gt; is the folder name displayed in Windows Explorer,
   not the actual folder name.
<P>
</UL>In all cases, ScanDisk does not detect that a problem exists on the drive.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The name of the file or folder contains characters from the extended
character set that cannot be converted to ANSI.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
You may be able to delete or rename the file or folder using one of the
following methods:

<UL><LI>If you want to delete a file, try to delete the file using the DEL
   command and "*.*" wildcard designator. Note that this method deletes
   all the files in the folder containing the file you want to delete, so
   you should move all the files you want to save to a different folder
   first. To do so, follow these steps:
<P>
   1. Type the following commands at an MS-DOS command prompt. Press
<P><PRE>      ENTER after each command:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>         cd \
         md keep

   2. Copy all the files you want to save from the folder containing the
      file you want to delete to the KEEP folder you created in step 1.

   3. In the directory containing the file you want to delete, type the
      following command at an MS-DOS command prompt and press ENTER:

         del *.*

</PRE><LI>For files and folders, you may be able to delete or rename the file or
   folder using the "?" wildcard designator to represent the extended
   characters in the file or folder name. For example, if the first
   character in the filename README.TXT were replaced by a character from
   the extended character set, you could use the following command to
   rename the file back to README.TXT:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ren ?eadme.txt readme.txt
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: The "?" wildcard designator is used to represent any character
   in the wildcard designator's position. Use caution when you use this
   method to make sure you do not inadvertently delete or rename files
   other than the intended file.

<LI>For files or folders, you may be able to delete the file or folder
   using the DELTREE command. To do so, change to the affected folder
   and type "deltree *.*" (without quotation marks). Confirm only the
   files and folders you want to delete. The DELTREE command removes
   files and folders without regard to extended characters in their
   names.

<LI>Use a disk utility such as Norton Disk Doctor from Symantec or PC
   Tools from Central Point Software to rename or delete the file.
