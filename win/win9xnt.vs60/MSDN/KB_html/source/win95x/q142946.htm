<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article lists troubleshooting steps to help you troubleshoot problems
with video codecs in Windows 95. A video codec is an algorithm used to
compress and decompress video files. The following problems are addressed
in this article:

<UL><LI>Missing codecs
<LI>Damaged codecs
<LI>Conflicts between 16-bit and 32-bit codecs
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Missing Codecs</h3>
 
<P>
Windows 95 includes 32-bit versions of several common video codecs. These
32-bit codecs are installed by default when you install Windows 95, and
are used by multimedia programs even if a 16-bit version of the same codec
is available.
<P>
To verify that the 32-bit codecs included with Windows 95 are installed,
follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>In Control Panel, double-click Add/Remove Programs.

<P><LI>Click the Windows Setup tab.

<P><LI>Click Multimedia, and then click Details.

<P><LI>Verify that the Video Compression check box is selected. If it is not
   selected, click the check box to select it, and then click OK.
<P>
</OL>If you still cannot play a particular video file after verifying that the
32-bit codecs included with Windows 95 are installed, the video file may
have been compressed using a third-party codec that is not included with
Windows 95. To determine which codec was used to compress the file, use
the right mouse button to click the file in Windows Explorer, click
Properties on the menu that appears, and then click the Details tab. The
Video Format line should contain information about the type of compression
used to compress the file.
<P>
If the codec used to compress the file is not one of the codecs included
with Windows 95, contact the manufacturer of the codec for information
about troubleshooting the problem. The following 32-bit video codecs are
included with Windows 95:

<UL><LI>Intel Indeo R3.1 (IV31)
<LI>Intel Indeo R3.2 (IV32)
<LI>Supermatch Cinepak
<LI>Microsoft RLE (MS-RLE)
<LI>Microsoft Video 1 (MS-CRAM)
<P>
</UL>If the codec used to compress the file is one of the codecs included with
Windows 95, you can verify that the particular codec is installed by
following these steps:

<OL><P><LI>In Control Panel, double-click Multimedia.

<P><LI>Click the Advanced tab.

<P><LI>Double-click the Video Compression Codecs branch to expand it.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: If you have installed the 16-bit version of a 32-bit codec that is
included with Windows 95, the 16-bit codec appears on the Advanced tab if
the 32-bit version is not installed or has been disabled.
<P>
If the codec used to compress the file is not listed, use the following
steps to install that codec:

<OL><P><LI>In Control Panel, double-click Add New Hardware.

<P><LI>Click Next, click No, and then click Next.

<P><LI>Click Sound, Video, And Game Controllers, and then click Next.

<P><LI>In the Manufacturers box, click the appropriate item:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - for RLE and Video 1, click Microsoft Video Codecs
    - for Cinepak, click SuperMatch
    - for R3.1 or R3.2, click Intel
</PRE>
<P><LI>Click the appropriate codec in the Models box, click Next, and then
   click Finish. If you are prompted to restart Windows 95, do so.
<P>
</OL><h3>Damaged Codecs</h3>
 
<P>
If you still cannot play a particular video file after verifying that the
codec used to compress the file is installed, the codec may be damaged. To
ensure that you are not using a damaged codec, follow these steps to
reinstall a codec:

<OL><P><LI>In Control Panel, double-click Multimedia.

<P><LI>On the Advanced tab, double-click the Video Compression Codecs branch
   to expand it.

<P><LI>Click the codec used to compress the file you are trying to play,
   click Properties, click Remove, and then click Yes.

<P><LI>Restart your computer.

<P><LI>In Control Panel, double-click Add New Hardware.

<P><LI>Click Next, click No, and then click Next.

<P><LI>Click Sound, Video, And Game Controllers, and then click Next.

<P><LI>In the Manufacturers box, click the appropriate item:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - for RLE and Video 1, click Microsoft Video Codecs
    - for Cinepak, click SuperMatch
    - for R3.1 or R3.2, click Intel
</PRE>
<P><LI>Click the appropriate codec in the Models box, click Next, and then
   click Finish. If you are prompted to restart Windows 95, do so.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: You cannot disable a video codec using the Windows 95 graphical user
interface (GUI). You can remove a video codec as described above, but you
cannot disable a video codec using the Windows 95 GUI. For information
about manually disabling a video codec, see the "Conflicts Between 16-Bit
and 32-Bit Codecs" section of this article.
<P>
If you still cannot play the file after reinstalling the video codec, you
may need to remove all the Windows 95 multimedia files, and then reinstall
them. To do so, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>In Control Panel, double-click Add/Remove Programs.

<P><LI>Click the Windows Setup tab.

<P><LI>Click the Multimedia check box to clear it, and then click OK.

<P><LI>Repeat steps 1-2.

<P><LI>Click the Multimedia check box to select it, and then click OK.
<P>
</OL><h3>Conflicts Between 16-Bit and 32-Bit Codecs</h3>
 
<P>
If the 32-bit version of a video codec that Windows 95 needs to play a
particular video file is not installed or is disabled, Windows 95 uses the
16-bit version of the codec if it is available. If the 32-bit version of
the codec is installed and is not disabled, Windows 95 uses the 32-bit
version by default. However, you may experience problems when both the 16-
bit and 32-bit versions of a particular codec are installed.
<P>
The following 16-bit video codecs are installed by the run-time version of
Microsoft Video for Windows and by many other Microsoft multimedia
programs:

<UL><LI>Intel Indeo R3.1 (IV31)
<LI>Intel Indeo R3.2 (IV32)
<LI>Intel Indeo R2.1/RAW (RT21)
<LI>Intel Indeo R2.1/RAW (YVU9)
<LI>Supermatch Cinepak
<LI>Microsoft RLE (MS-RLE)
<LI>Microsoft Video 1 (MS-CRAM)
<P>
</UL>These 16-bit codecs appear in the [Drivers] section of the System.ini
file, but do not appear when you double-click the Multimedia icon in
Control Panel, click the Advanced tab, and then expand the Video
Compression Codecs branch. To disable a 16-bit codec, disable or remove
the line in the System.ini file that corresponds to that codec. To disable
a line, place a semicolon (;) at the beginning of the line. After
disabling the 16-bit version of the codec, reinstall the 32-bit version
using the steps described in the "Damaged Codecs" section of this article.
<P>
The following lines in the System.ini file correspond to the 16-bit video
codecs that are installed by Microsoft Video for Windows version 1.1d:
<P>
<PRE>   [drivers]
   vidc.rt21=indeov.drv
   vidc.yvu9=indeov.drv
   vidc.msvc=msvidc.drv
   vidc.iv31=indeov.drv
   vidc.mrle=msrle.drv

</PRE></OL>The following lines in the System.ini file correspond to the 16-bit video
codecs that are installed by Microsoft Video for Windows version 1.1e:
<P>
<PRE>   [drivers]
   vidc.msvc=msvidc.drv
   vidc.rt21=indeov.drv
   vidc.iv32=ir32.dll
   vidc.iv31=ir32.dll
   vidc.mrle=msrle.drv
   vidc.yvu9=ir21_r.dll

</PRE>To disable a 32-bit codec, disable or remove the line in the System.ini
file that corresponds to that codec. To disable a line, place a semicolon
(;) at the beginning of the line. The following lines in the [Drivers32]
section of the System.ini file correspond to the 32-bit video codecs that
are installed by Windows 95:
<P>
<PRE>   [drivers32]
   vidc.cvid=iccvid.dll
   vidc.iv31=ir32_32.dll
   vidc.iv32=ir32_32.dll
   vidc.msvc=msvidc32.dll
   vidc.mrle=msrle32.dll

</PRE>If you are using a 16-bit multimedia program in Windows 95, you may want
to disable the 32-bit version of a particular codec instead of disabling
the 16-bit version.
