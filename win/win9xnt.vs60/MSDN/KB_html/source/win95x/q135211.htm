The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Windows 95 identifies a user's profile by username only. The authenticating
server or domain is not taken into account, so users with the same username
on different servers or domains appear to be the same user to Windows 95,
and use the same user profile.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
When a user logs on, if the profile on the workstation is newer than the
profile on the server, the profile is copied to the server. This behavior
is by design for mobile computing, because the user may have changed the
profile while not connected to the network.
<P>
To work around this limitation, use any one of the following methods:

<UL><LI>Have users with the same usernames on different servers or domains
   change their usernames so they are not identical.

<LI>When another user with the same username logs on in the future, have
   that user click No when prompted with:
<P>
<P><PRE>      You have not logged on at this computer before. Would you like this
      computer to retain your individual settings for use when you log on
      here in the future?
</PRE>
<LI>Make the user profiles with this problem mandatory, by renaming the
   User.dat file to User.man in the user's home directory.
<P>
   Note that Windows 95 does not copy the profile back to the server in
   this case, and the user is forced to use the profile.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
