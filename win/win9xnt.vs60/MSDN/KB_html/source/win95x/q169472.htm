The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry. 
Before you edit the registry, you should first make a backup copy of the 
registry files (System.dat and User.dat). Both are hidden files in the 
Windows folder.
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the right mouse button to click a drive, folder, or printer,
there may be no Sharing command on the menu that appears even though the 
"File and printer sharing for Microsoft Networks" component is installed 
in Network properties.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Nwserver.vxd file may be loading even though the "File and printer 
sharing for NetWare Networks" component is not installed in Network 
properties.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this problem, use one of the following methods:
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1</h3>
 
<P>
If the Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks is installed on your computer
and you do not connect to a NetWare server, remove the client from Network
properties. To remove the Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks, follow 
these steps:

<OL><P><LI>In Control Panel, double-click Network.

<P><LI>Click Client For NetWare Networks.

<P><LI>Click Remove, and then click OK.

<P><LI>Restart your computer when you are prompted to do so.
<P>
</OL><h3>Method 2</h3>
 
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems 
that may require you to reinstall Windows 95. Microsoft cannot guarantee 
that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be 
solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
NOTE: For information about how to edit the registry, view the Changing 
Keys And Values online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Note 
that you should make a backup copy of the registry files (System.dat and 
User.dat) before you edit the registry.
<P>
If sharing is still not available, determine if the Nwserver.vxd file is 
loading by following these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Find, and then click Files Or
   Folders.

<P><LI>In the Named box, type:
<P>
<P><PRE>      nwserver.vxd
</PRE>
<P><LI>Click Find Now.

<P><LI>If the file is found, use the right mouse button to click the 
   Nwserver.vxd file, and then click Rename on the menu that appears.

<P><LI>Rename the file to Nwserver.xxx, and then press ENTER.

<P><LI>Shut down and restart your computer. If you receive the following error
   message when you computer starts, the Nwserver.vxd file is being called
   from the registry:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Cannot find a device necessary to run Windows.
      Nwserver.vxd
</PRE><P>
   If you receive this error message, sharing should now be available.

<P><LI>To remove the reference to Nwserver.vxd in the registry, use Registry 
   Editor to delete the StaticVxD value in the NWServer subkey under the 
   following registry entry:
<P>
<P><PRE>      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\VxD\NWServer
</PRE><P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Nwserver.vxd file provides file and printer sharing for NetWare 
networks in Windows 95; the Vserver.vxd file provides file and printer 
sharing for Microsoft networks. These two components cannot function 
simultaneously in Windows 95.
