The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
<LI>Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release versions 1, 2, 2.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run a 16-bit program created using Microsoft Visual Basic 4.0,
you may receive either of the following error messages:

<UL><LI>Run-time error 438: Property or method not found

<LI>Run-time error 423: Object doesn't support this property or method
<P>
</UL>When either of these error messages occurs, the program may not be able to
continue running and may terminate unexpectedly.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
These error message can occur if the following conditions exist:

<UL><LI>The 16-bit program references some of its controls as variables.

<LI>Windows 95 is configured for a region other than the Unites States.

<LI>There is not enough physical memory (RAM) in the computer for all the
   currently running programs to run completely in RAM memory.
<P>
</UL>There is a problem in the LSTRCMP and LSTRCMPI string-comparison functions
in Windows 95. This problem prevents the string comparison from succeeding
if Windows 95 is configured for a non-U.S. locale and one of the strings
being compared is in a 16-bit segment that has been discarded. Microsoft
Visual Basic 4.0 relies on these string-comparison functions to find the
program's controls, depending on how the program is written. The error
message occurs if the program cannot find its controls.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, use any of the following methods:

<UL><LI>Change the Windows 95 location setting to "English (United States)"
   using the Regional Settings tool in Control Panel.

<LI>Run the program in Microsoft Windows NT.

<LI>Compile the program as a 32-bit program.

<LI>Compile the program using Visual Basic 5.0, which does not mark code
   segments as discardable when the program is compiled.

<LI>Rewrite the program to change the way it references its controls. For
   information about this method, see the "More Information" section of
   this article.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows 95 and Windows 95
OEM Service Release 2 (OSR2). We are researching this problem and will
post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Visual Basic 4.0 relies on these string-comparison functions to
find names of the program's controls when the controls are referenced as
variables (see below). Programs created using Microsoft Visual Basic 4.0
have their control names stored in code segments marked discardable. Under
relatively low-memory conditions, one or more of these segments may be
discarded, to be reloaded again as needed.
<P>
When non-U.S. regional settings are in use, the LSTRCMP and LSTRCMPI
functions do not cause the discarded code segment to be reloaded when the
strings are compared, and return a result indicating that the strings do
not match. When the string comparison does not find the matching control
name when it is needed, the program displays one of the error messages,
may not be able to continue running, and may terminate unexpectedly.
<P>
The following code samples demonstrate how a control can be referenced as
a variable with Visual Basic:
<P>
Example 1:
<P>
<PRE>   Dim myForm As Form
   Set myForm = Form1
   If myForm.ssTab1.Tab = 1 Then ' Error 438 when (.) operator is used
        MsgBox "Tab 1"
   End If

</PRE>Example 2:
<P>
<PRE>   Dim myForm As Form
   Set myForm = Form1
   If myForm!ssTab1.Tab = 1 Then ' Error 423 when (!) operator is used
        MsgBox "Tab 1"
   End If

</PRE>You can work around this problem by using the (.) operator and changing
the code to use a Property procedure, as in this example:
<P>
<PRE>   Dim myForm As Form
   Set myForm = Form1
   If myForm.Tab1.Tab = 1 Then ' No error with (.) operator
        MsgBox "Tab 1"
   End If

   Public Property Get Tab1() As Control
            Set Tab1 = ssTab1
   End Property
