<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article discusses restartable DriveSpace compression operations in
Windows 95 and Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95. Restartable operations are
operations that can restart automatically if the operation is interrupted
and the computer reboots.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>DriveSpace Restartability</h3>
 
<P>
DriveSpace operations are restartable either because the computer may
be rendered unusable if the operation is interrupted, or because the
operation requires that the computer be restarted to finish. The
following DriveSpace operations are restartable:

<UL><LI>Compressing an existing drive
<LI>Uncompressing a DoubleSpace or DriveSpace drive
<LI>Creating a new, empty DriveSpace drive
<LI>Changing the size of a DoubleSpace or DriveSpace drive
<LI>Changing the estimated compression ratio (ECR) for a DoubleSpace or
   DriveSpace drive
<LI>Mounting a DoubleSpace or DriveSpace drive
<LI>Upgrading (converting) a DoubleSpace or DriveSpace drive to
   DriveSpace 3 format
<P>
</UL>Some of these operations may prevent Windows 95 from starting properly if
the computer is rebooted before the operation is complete. For example,
while compressing the directories that contain the Windows 95 system files,
the Windows 95 files may be located on two different drives. If the
computer restarts at this point, Windows 95 may be unable to start until
the compression process is finished. Other operations, such as mounting a
DriveSpace or DoubleSpace drive, may simply need to restart the computer to
ensure that the DriveSpace driver is loaded and is configured with the
appropriate settings. To ensure restartability, DriveSpace uses one of two
methods, determined as follows:

<UL><LI>If a new, empty DriveSpace drive is being created, DriveSpace uses the
   quick restartability method.

<LI>If the operation being performed involves a drive for which an
   exclusive-access file system lock cannot be obtained, DriveSpace uses
   the full restartability method.
<P>
   NOTE: DriveSpace is unable to obtain an exclusive lock on any drive
   containing open files. The drive that contains the Windows folder,
   the drive that contains the Windows swap file, and a drive from which a
   program is currently running all typically contain open files.

<LI>If none of the above conditions apply, DriveSpace uses quick
   restartability.
<P>
</UL>Essentially, quick restartability is used if DriveSpace is sure that the
operation being performed does not endanger the Windows 95 files, and that
at no point during the operation would Windows 95 be unable to load. In
this case, DriveSpace creates a Restart.drv file to indicate which
operation is being performed, and places the following command in the
RunOnce key in the registry:
<P>
<PRE>   DRVSPACE /RESTART /INTERACTIVE

</PRE>Placing this command in the registry causes DriveSpace to be restarted
automatically if the computer reboots. When the operation is complete, this
registry entry and the Restart.drv file are removed.
<P>
Full restartability is used when the operation being performed may
temporarily prevent Windows 95 from starting. This method uses mini-
Windows, which is a Windows 3.1 subset that is also used by the Windows 95
Setup program. By placing a copy of the mini-Windows files on the physical
boot drive before beginning the operation, DriveSpace ensures that a GUI
operating environment will be available in the event of a reboot.
DriveSpace performs the following steps to prepare for full
restartability:

<OL><P><LI>Finds the physical boot drive (PBD), which is the drive that would be
   drive C if no disk compression software were loaded. This drive is
   guaranteed to always be available.

<P><LI>Creates a file called Restart.drv in the root directory of the PBD.
   This file contains information about which operation is being
   performed, and what the current status of that operation is.

<P><LI>Creates a Failsafe.drv directory on the PBD and copies the mini-Windows
   files to this directory. The mini-Windows files are stored in the
   Mini.cab cabinet file, which the Setup program copies to the
   Windows\System directory.
<P>
   NOTE: The Failsafe.drv directory is not automatically deleted from the
   PBD when the current operation is successfully completed. This
   eliminates the need for DriveSpace to create the directory and copy the
   mini-Windows files to it during future operations that require full
   restartability.

<P><LI>Ensures that there are copies of the Config.sys and Autoexec.bat files
   on the PBD. If the files are not present on the PBD, but drive C is
   compressed and copies of the files are present there, the files are
   copied from drive C to the PBD. If the files are not present on the PBD
   and drive C is not compressed, new copies of the Config.sys and
   Autoexec.bat files are created on the PBD.

<P><LI>Copies itself into the Failsafe.drv directory, using the name
   W31space.exe. This copy is then updated to appear compatible with
   Windows 3.1.

<P><LI>Replaces the current SHELL= line in the mini-Windows System.ini file
   with the following line:
<P>
<P><PRE>      SHELL=W31SPACE.EXE
</PRE><P>
   This causes mini-Windows to run DriveSpace when it starts. It
   automatically recognizes the current scenario and infers the missing
   /RESTART switch.

<P><LI>Looks at each line in the Config.sys file on the PBD, and copies each
   driver referenced in that file from its original location to the
   Failsafe.drv directory. The lines in the Config.sys file are then
   changed to reference this copy of the file, instead of the original
   copy (in the Config.sys file, the PBD is always referenced as drive C,
   regardless of its current drive letter).
<P>
   NOTE: Backup copies of the Config.sys and Autoexec.bat files are copied
   to the Failsafe.drv directory and named Config.pss and Autoexec.pss. In
   addition, DriveSpace temporarily disables any line in the Config.sys
   file that loads Emm386.exe, to make sure that problems do not arise on
   computers with unusable upper memory blocks (UMBs). If mini-Windows
   cannot start, the Emm386.exe line is re-enabled and mini-Windows
   attempts to start again.

<P><LI>Modifies the Autoexec.bat file on the PBD so that it runs Dosx.exe from
   the Failsafe.drv directory, which starts mini-Windows.

<P><LI>If drive C is compressed, the line in the Dblspace.ini or Drvspace.ini
   file that causes drive C to be mounted is removed. This ensures that
   the PBD is always drive C.
<P>
   NOTE: When you compress drive C, the Failsafe.drv directory is not
   compressed, and can be found on the uncompressed host drive when the
   operation is complete.
<P>
</OL><h3>Upgrading a Drive to DriveSpace 3</h3>
 
<P>
When you convert an existing DoubleSpace or DriveSpace drive to DriveSpace
3, DriveSpace performs the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Renames the existing DoubleSpace or DriveSpace compressed volume file
   (CVF) to Dblspace.030 or Drvspace.030. If a file with that name already
   exists, the extension .031 is tried instead. If a file with that name
   already exists, the extension .032 is tried, and so on until a unique
   file name is found.

<P><LI>Creates a new CVF in DriveSpace 3 format.

<P><LI>Mounts the new CVF using the protected-mode DriveSpace 3 driver.

<P><LI>Mounts the original DoubleSpace or DriveSpace CVF.

<P><LI>Moves all data from the original CVF to the new CVF.

<P><LI>Unmounts and then deletes the original CVF.
<P></OL>
