</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following tools are included with Microsoft Windows 95 Service Pack 1.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Batch Installation Utility Version 2.0 for Windows 95</h3>
 
<P>
Usage:
<P>
The Microsoft Batch Installation Utility (Batch.Exe) is a tool designed to
provide a user interface for creating Msbatch.Inf files for scripted
setups. By running this program and answering as many or as few questions
as desired, Windows 95 Setup procedures can be made completely automatic.
<P>
Batch Setup version 2.0 includes the following new features:

<UL><LI>You can have Batch Setup scan your Windows 95 registry and create an
   .inf file based on your current settings. For more information about
   which registry settings Batch Setup can retrieve, search Batch Setup
   Help.

<LI>You can now specify which protocol to make the default from within the
   Batch Setup program.

<LI>More settings are available to configure File and Print Services for
   Microsoft Networks or File and Print Services for NetWare networks.

<LI>Administrators can now choose whether to disable the Netcard Resource
   Conflict Resolution Wizard during setup. (This option is disabled by
   default.)

<LI>With one click, you can enable or disable all optional components in a
   single area.

<LI>Batch Setup finds user-level security settings.

<LI>Locates client TCP/IP settings (for example, DNS servers).
<P>
</UL>To start Windows Batch Setup click Start and select Programs. Click Windows
Batch Setup. Selections can be made by placing a check mark in the
appropriate selection you wish to automate. Please see the online help for
instructions on running Windows 95 Setup in Batch Mode.
