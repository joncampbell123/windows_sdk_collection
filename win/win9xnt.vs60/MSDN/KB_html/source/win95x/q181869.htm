The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
<LI>Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release versions 1, 2, 2.1, 2.5
</UL>

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When roving profiles are implemented, Desktop or Start Menu folders that
are not empty when you delete them from the client computer are not
deleted from the server profile when you log off. When you log back on,
the folders are restored, and are empty.
<P>
Note that if an empty folder is deleted, it is deleted from the server
profile, and is not restored during logon.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs because during the logoff process, in order to
synchronize the server copy of the desktop with the client, the folder
structure of the client desktop is first enumerated in a hierarchical
order, parent folders first. The server copy of the desktop is also
enumerated, and compared to the client hierarchy. Differences found
between them are the source of a work list, that includes file and folder
deletions to be performed. The work list is processed in the same order as
the enumeration, and since parent folders are listed first, they are not
empty when the delete request is issued to the server.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
This issue is resolved by the following updated file for Windows 95, all
versions, which adds functionality to optimize the order in which folder
deletions are requested:
<P>
<PRE>   MPRSERV.DLL version 4.00.958  dated 2/25/98 09:58am  127,488 bytes

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95
(retail release), and Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Releases 2 (OSR2)
and 2.1 (OSR2.1). An update to address this problem is now available, but
is not fully regression tested and should be applied only to computers
experiencing this specific problem. Unless you are severely impacted by
this specific problem, Microsoft does not recommend implementing this
update at this time. Contact Microsoft Technical Support for additional
information about the availability of this update.
