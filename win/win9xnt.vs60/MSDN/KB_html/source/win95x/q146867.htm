<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you log on to a Microsoft Windows NT version 3.51-based computer from
a Windows 95-based computer, your user profile may not be loaded. Instead,
a default user profile may be loaded. Also, when you quit Windows 95, the
default user profile you are using may overwrite your existing user
profile in the home directory on the Windows NT-based computer. Or, you
may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   An error occurred while copying the file &lt;xxxxx.xxx&gt;. Profile Error 9.

   Some of your profile settings may not be available.

</PRE>&lt;xxxxx.xxx&gt; usually refers to a .lnk file.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
If a user profile is located in a compressed folder on a Windows NT-based
computer, it is not read by Windows 95.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Do not store user profiles in compressed folders on Windows NT-based
computers. If necessary, uncompress the folder used to store user profiles
and re-create the user profiles.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95. A
fix to this problem is in development, but has not been regression tested
and may be destabilizing in production environments. Microsoft does not
recommend implementing this fix at this time. Contact Microsoft Technical
Support for more information on the availability of this fix.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Although Windows 95 does not read user profiles stored in compressed
folders on Windows NT-based computers, it can overwrite them. When you
quit Windows 95, the current user profile is written to the home directory
on the Windows NT-based computer. If a default user profile is loaded with
you log on to Windows 95, the default profile overwrites your existing
user profile when you quit Windows 95.
<P>
Uncompressing the folder allows Windows 95 to read user profiles in the
folder, but does not restore user profiles that have been overwritten.
