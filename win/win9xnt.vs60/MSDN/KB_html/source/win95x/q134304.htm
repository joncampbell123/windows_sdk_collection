The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article contains steps to help you troubleshoot network browsing
problems in Windows 95. Browsing problems are usually indicated by
trouble viewing peer servers in Network Neighborhood.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Step 1: Verify the Problem</h3>
 
<P>
Verify that you are having a browsing problem, not a problem with
network connectivity. To do so, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Find, and then click Computer.

<P><LI>In the Named box, type
<P>
<P><PRE>      &lt;Computer_Name&gt;
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;Computer_Name&gt; is the name of the network server you want to
   browse.

<P><LI>Click Find Now.
<P>
</OL>If the server is found, its name appears in the Name column and its
workgroup or Windows NT domain appears in the Location column. If the
computer is not found, verify that it is turned on and correctly
connected to the network.
<P>
If the server is found and its location is a different workgroup than
your computer's, the server will not appear in Network Neighborhood.
To determine your computer's workgroup, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Use the right mouse button to click Network Neighborhood, then click
   Properties on the menu that appears.

<P><LI>Click the Identification tab.

<P><LI>Note the name of the workgroup displayed in the Workgroup box.
<P>
</OL><h3>Step 2: Verify That the Correct Network Client Is Loaded</h3>
 
<P>
Verify that the Microsoft Client for Microsoft Networks is installed
on your computer. To do so, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Use the right mouse button to click Network Neighborhood, then click
   Properties on the menu that appears.

<P><LI>On the Configuration tab, examine the list of installed network
   components and verify that the following client is installed:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Client For Microsoft Networks
</PRE><P>
</OL>If this client is not installed, you can install it using the following
steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click Add.

<P><LI>Click Client, and then click Add.

<P><LI>Click Microsoft, click Client For Microsoft Networks, and then click
   OK.

<P><LI>Click OK.

<P><LI>When you are prompted to restart your computer, do so.
<P>
</OL><h3>Step 3: Verify That File and Printer Sharing Is Installed</h3>
 
<P>
Verify that the File And Printer Sharing For Microsoft Networks
component is installed. To do so, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Use the right mouse button to click Network Neighborhood, then click
   Properties on the menu that appears.

<P><LI>On the Configuration tab, examine the list of installed network
   components and verify that the following component is installed:
<P>
<P><PRE>      File And Printer Sharing For Microsoft Networks
</PRE><P>
</OL>If this component is not installed, you can install it using the
following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click the Add button.

<P><LI>Click Service, and then click Add.

<P><LI>Click Microsoft, click File And Printer Sharing For Microsoft Networks,
   and then click OK.

<P><LI>On the Configuration tab, click OK.

<P><LI>When you are prompted to restart your computer, do so.
<P>
</OL>After you install this service, allow up to 15 minutes for the server
to appear in the browse list. To refresh the current browse list,
click Refresh on the View menu.
<P>
<P><h3>Step 4: Verify That a Common NetBIOS Protocol Is Installed</h3>
 
<P>
If the server still does not appear in the browse list, verify that a
common NetBIOS protocol is installed on your computer and the server.
The following protocols are NetBIOS compliant:

<UL><LI>NetBEUI
<LI>TCP/IP
<LI>IPX/SPX
<P>
</UL><h3>Step 5: Check the Master Browse Server</h3>
 
<P>
Verify that the master browse server is functioning correctly by
typing the following command at an MS-DOS prompt
<P>
<PRE>   net view /workgroup:&lt;wkgrp_name&gt;

</PRE></OL>where &lt;wkgrp_name&gt; is the name of your workgroup. If your workgroup
name contains spaces, enclose the workgroup name in quotation marks.
For example, if your workgroup name is My Workgroup, type the
following line:
<P>
<PRE>   net view /workgroup:"My Workgroup"

</PRE>This command retrieves a browse list from the master browse server.
If you can retrieve a browse list from the master browse server, one
of the following problems may exist on the network:

<UL><LI>A backup browse server is not functioning correctly.

<LI>A backup browse server does not have an updated browse list. Retrieving
   an updated browse list can take up to 15 minutes.
<P>
</UL>NOTE: If a computer is removed from the network before the computer
is logged off the network, it may take up to 51 minutes for that
computer to be removed from the browse list.
<P>
<P><h3>Step 6: Verify That the Browse Server Is Available</h3>
 
<P>
If your network includes computers that are frequently powered off or
removed from the network (such as mobile computers), it is a good idea to
disable browse server duties on these computers. To disable browse server
duties on a Windows 95-based computer, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Use the right mouse button to click Network Neighborhood, and then
   click Properties on the menu that appears.

<P><LI>On the Configuration tab, click the File And Printer Sharing For
   Microsoft Networks component, and then click Properties.

<P><LI>In the Property box, click Browse Master, and then click Disabled in
   the Value box.

<P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: At least one computer in each workgroup must have the ability
to become the master browse server. If browse server capability is
disabled on all the computers in a network, browse functionality is
disabled.
