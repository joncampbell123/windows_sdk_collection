The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you try to use the Uninstall option in the Add/Remove Programs
tool, you may receive the following error message when your computer
restarts:
<P>
<PRE>   Uninstall is unable to write to the MBR

</PRE>When this occurs, the Uninstall procedure cannot be completed, and you
may not be able to start the computer from the hard disk.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem can occur when any of the following conditions exists:

<UL><LI>The hard disk's Master Boot Record (MBR) is damaged.

<LI>A software or hardware-level virus scanning program is protecting
   the MBR.

<LI>You are using third-party disk partitioning software.

<LI>You computer has been infected with a boot-sector virus.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Use the information in the appropriate section below to try to resolve
the problem. If you cannot start your computer from the hard disk, you
can start it using your Windows 95 Startup disk.
<P>
<P><h3>MBR Protected by Virus Scanning Software</h3>
 
<P>
If you suspect that a virus scanning program is preventing Uninstall
from writing to the MBR, disable the virus scanning program by editing
the Config.sys or Autoexec.bat file to temporarily disable the program.
Place the word "Rem" (without quotation marks and followed by a space)
at the beginning of the line or lines used to load the virus scanning
program. After you make this change, restart the computer.
<P>
For information about the virus scanning program, consult the program's
documentation or manufacturer.
<P>
<P><h3>MBR Protected by Hardware-Level Virus Scanning Program</h3>
 
<P>
To disable hardware-level virus detection, run your computer's CMOS
configuration utility and disable the virus detection.
<P>
For information about your computer's CMOS configuration utility, please
consult the computer's documentation or manufacturer.
<P>
<P><h3>Third-Party Partitioning Software</h3>
 
<P>
If third-party partitioning software is preventing Uninstall from
writing to the MBR, refer to the software's documentation for
information about restoring the previous MBR or modifying the current
MBR.
<P>
<P><h3>Boot-Sector Virus</h3>
 
<P>
If you suspect that your computer has been infected with a boot-sector
virus, use an anti-virus program to detect and remove the virus.
<P>
For additional information about viruses, please see the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : Methods to Detect a Boot-Sector Virus

<P>
<PRE>   &lt;disk&gt;:\uninstal &lt;W95undo.dat_location&gt;

</PRE>where &lt;disk&gt; is the drive containing the Startup disk and
&lt;W95undo.dat_location&gt; is the full path to the W95undo.dat file.
