The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
You may receive an error message when you create a file or folder in the
root directory. The exact error message depends on the method used to
create the file or folder.
<P>
Using the COPY command in an MS-DOS session reports the following:
<P>
<PRE>   Cannot make directory entry - &lt;filename&gt;

</PRE>WordPad and Paint report the following when saving a file to the root
directory:
<P>
<PRE>   &lt;filename&gt;: This filename is not valid.

</PRE>When you try to create a new folder in the root directory in My Computer
or Windows Explorer, you receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Unable to create &lt;"New Folder"&gt;. Make sure the disk is not full or
   read-only.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when all 512 root directory entries have been used.
This problem can also occur with fewer than 512 files and folders in the
root directory because Windows 95 uses additional directory entries to
store long file names.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
To ensure compatibility with MS-DOS, Windows 95 uses a standard file
allocation table (FAT) file system. The root directory for a FAT drive has
a fixed size and is stored in a fixed location on the disk. All hard disk
drives use 32 sectors of 512 bytes each to store the root directory. This
limits the root directory on a hard disk drive to 16K: 32 sectors x 512
bytes per sector = 16,384 bytes, or 16K.
<P>
MS-DOS uses one directory entry for each file and folder, but Windows 95
uses additional directory entries to store long file names and folder
names, and the associated 8.3 aliases. This means that you can run out of
directory entries with fewer than 512 files or folders in the root
directory.
<P>
Folders do not have a fixed size, so the only limitation to the number of
files or folders you can store in any folder with Windows 95 is free disk
space. For this reason, it is best to store your files (programs and data)
in a folder off the root directory.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Use the following steps to free root directory entries:

<OL><P><LI>Check the drive for invalid long file names, and then defragment the
   drive as follows:
<P>
   Use the right mouse button to click the drive icon in My Computer or
   Windows Explorer and the click Properties on the menu that appears.
   Click the Tools tab and then click Check Now. Perform the default
   correction if invalid long file names are found. Then choose Defragment
   Now.

<P><LI>Rename any files or folders in the root directory using only upper-
   case 8.3-compliant file or folder names.
<P>
   The characters that are valid for an 8.3-compliant file or folder name
   include any combination of letters (A-Z) and/or numbers (0-9), plus the
   following special characters:
<P>
<PRE>      $   Dollar sign
      %   Percent sign
      '   Apostrophe
      `   Opening single quotation mark
      -   Hyphen
      @   At sign
      {   Left brace
      }   Right brace
      ~   Tilde
      !   Exclamation point
      #   Number sign
      (   Opening parenthesis
      )   Closing parenthesis
      &amp;   Ampersand
      _   Underscore
      ^   Caret

</PRE><P><LI>Move some files or folders out of the root directory.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
An MS-DOS FAT root directory contains a separate entry for every file and
folder it contains. These directory entries contain information such as
the file name, extension, attributes, time and date the file was last
modified, the starting cluster number, and the file size. Each directory
entry uses 32 bytes to store this information. Because the root directory
is 16K in size, it can contain a maximum of 512 directory entries, which
are 32 bytes each.
<P>
When you name a file or folder in Windows 95, the system creates a primary
file name, which can be a long file name, and an MS-DOS-compliant 8.3
alias. If the file or folder name is already 8.3-compliant, only one
directory entry is used.
<P>
NOTE: For a file or folder name to be 8.3-compliant, it must contain only
those characters that are valid for an 8.3 alias name, and it must be
composed of all uppercase characters.
<P>
Windows 95 allows file and folder names to contain up to 250 characters.
Valid characters for a Windows 95 file name include all the valid MS-DOS
file name characters, the space character, and the following additional
characters:
<P>
<PRE>   +   Plus sign
   ,   Comma
   .   Period
   =   Equal sign
   [   Opening bracket
   ]   Closing bracket

</PRE></OL>Windows 95 file names are not case sensitive, but the case is preserved.
The primary file names can include upper, lower, or mixed-case characters.
For example, you can name a file "MyText.txt" and the file system
preserves the case formatting.
<P>
If the file name is not 8.3-compliant, Windows 95 automatically generates
an 8.3 alias for the file name. An additional directory entry is used to
store the 8.3 alias. If the primary file name contains more than 13
characters, an additional directory entry is used.
<P>
The following table shows some primary file names, their 8.3 aliases, and
directory entry usage in Windows 95:

   This is a very long
    file name.test       THISIS~2.TES        4

</PRE>NOTE: Any file whose name contains more than 13 characters requires 3 or
more directory entries.
