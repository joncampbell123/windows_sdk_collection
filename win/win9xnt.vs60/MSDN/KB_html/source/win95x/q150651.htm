<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article contains questions and answers about Microsoft DirectX version
1.0.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 

<PRE>1. Q. What is Microsoft DirectX?

   A. Microsoft DirectX is a set of drivers that is available with the
      Microsoft Game Software Development Kit (SDK).

2. Q. What components make up Microsoft DirectX?

   A. DirectX components include DirectDraw, DirectInput, DirectPlay, and
      DirectSound. DirectDraw and DirectSound components replace current
      Windows 95 display and sound drivers with DirectX drivers.

3. Q. How do I obtain Microsoft DirectX?

   A. If you develop computer games and you want to provide DirectX
      functionality within your game, you need the Microsoft Game SDK. The
      Game SDK is available on the Microsoft Developer's Network (MSDN)
      Level 2 CD-ROM.

      Independent software vendors (ISVs) who use these components in
      their games can redistribute them.

4. Q. What is DirectDraw?

   A. DirectDraw allows direct access of video display memory, hardware
      blters, hardware overlays, and page flipping. DirectDraw provides
      this functionality while maintaining compatibility with existing
      Windows 95-based programs and device drivers.

      Essentially, DirectDraw is a memory manager for video memory. Using
      DirectDraw, a program can manipulate video memory with ease,
      taking full advantage of the blitting and color decompression
      capabilities of different types of video hardware without becoming
      dependent on a particular piece of hardware.

5. Q. What is DirectInput?

   A. The Microsoft DirectInput application programming interface (API)
      provides fast and consistent access to analog and digital joysticks.
      The DirectInput API maintains consistency with the joystick APIs of
      the Microsoft Win32 Software Development Kit (SDK), but has improved
      responsiveness and reliability by changing the device driver model.
      DirectInput device drivers also use the registry to store settings
      for standard joysticks, calibration information for previously
      configured joysticks, and settings for OEM-supplied joysticks.

6. Q. What is DirectPlay?

   A. The Microsoft DirectPlay application programming interface (API) for
      Windows 95 is a software interface that simplifies game access to
      communication services. DirectPlay provides a way for games to
      communicate with each other that is independent of the underlying
      transport, protocol, or online service.

7. Q. What is DirectSound?

   A. The Microsoft DirectSound application programming interface (API) is
      the audio component of the Microsoft Windows 95 Game SDK that
      provides low-latency mixing, hardware acceleration, and direct
      access to the sound device. DirectSound provides this functionality
      while maintaining compatibility with existing Windows 95-based
      programs and device drivers.

8. Q. What do I do if I have problems with the DirectX drivers that
      replace my Windows 95 video and sound drivers?

   A. If you experience problems with the DirectX video or sound drivers,
      you can remove them by running Dxsetup.exe. Dxsetup.exe is supplied
      by the product that installed DirectX. For example, some games
      include DirectX support.

      NOTE: After you run Dxsetup.exe, some DirectX files remain in the
      Windows\System folder. These files do not affect the Windows 95
      video or sound drivers. To remove these files, restart your computer
      to an MS-DOS prompt and remove the following files from the
      Windows\System folder:

         Dsound.*
         Ddraw.*
         Ddhelp.exe
         Dplay.dll
         Dpserial.dll
         Dpwsock.dll

9. Q. Who supports Microsoft Game SDK and DirectX?

   A. Microsoft Game SDK is supported by Microsoft Developer Support. The
      DirectX drivers, such as video and sound drivers, are supported by
      the Desktop Systems group. If your DirectX drivers are provided by
      an original equipment manufacturer (OEM), the drivers are supported
      by that manufacturer.
