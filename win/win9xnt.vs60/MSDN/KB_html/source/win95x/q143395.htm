The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After you install Microsoft Exchange, the Program Files\Microsoft Exchange
folder name may be truncated to Program Files\Micros~1, or Progra~1\
Micros~&lt;x&gt;, where &lt;x&gt; can be any number.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior can occur if the Microsoft Exchange folder or the Program
Files folder was deleted or damaged before you installed Microsoft
Exchange.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To restore the correct folder name and verify that the program will
function correctly, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Remove Microsoft Exchange using the Add/Remove Programs tool in
   Control Panel.

<P><LI>Use Windows Explorer or My Computer to delete any remaining Microsoft
   Exchange or Micros~&lt;x&gt; folders in the Program Files folder, where &lt;x&gt;
   is any number from 1 to 9.

<P><LI>Install Microsoft Exchange using the Add/Remove Programs tool in
   Control Panel.

<P><LI>Rename the Micros~1 folder to Test. Acknowledge the error messages
   that occur. Rename the Test folder to Microsoft Exchange, and
   acknowledge the error messages that occur.
<P>
   The reason you rename the Micros~1 folder to Test and then to Microsoft
   Exchange is that renaming the Micros~1 folder directly to Microsoft
   Exchange would create a short name of Micros~2 for the folder, which
   would not solve the problem.

<P><LI>Use the right mouse button to click the Microsoft Exchange folder, and
   then click Properties on the menu that appears. Verify that the short
   name for the folder is Micros~1, and then choose OK.

<P><LI>Extract the Mlset32.exe and Mlshext.dll files from your original
   Windows 95 disks or CD-ROM to the Microsoft Exchange folder. For
   information about using the Extract tool, please see the following
   article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../zmiscellaneous/q129605.htm">Q129605</A></B>
<PRE></PRE>      TITLE     : How to Extract Original Compressed Windows Files

   The Mlset32.exe file is located in the Win95_07.cab cabinet file on
   disk 7 or the Windows 95 CD-ROM. The Mlshext.dll file is located in the
   Win95_06.cab cabinet file on disk 6 or the Windows 95 CD-ROM.

</PRE><P><LI>Double-click the Mlset32.exe file in the Microsoft Exchange folder to
   run it. Follow the instructions in the Microsoft Exchange Wizard.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Exchange requires the Program Files\Microsoft Exchange folder to
have the short folder name Progra~1\Micros~1. If this is not the case,
Microsoft Exchange cannot be installed correctly.
<P>

Microsoft Exchange, please see the following article in the Microsoft
