The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
<LI>Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release version 2
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you map drive letters to multiple Distributed File System (DFS)
network shares from a Windows 95 DFS client, and then change to different
drives and folders within those shares from a command prompt, the drive
letter mappings may be switched.
<P>
For example, if drive X is mapped to Share1, and drive Y is mapped to
Share2, the drive letters may be switched so that drive X is mapped to
Share2, and drive Y is mapped to Share1.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may occur if either of the following conditions exist:

<UL><LI>There are multiple DFS shares on different servers.

<LI>There are multiple DFS root volumes that contain mappings to same-named
   DFS leaf objects on different servers.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
This issue is resolved by the following updated file for Windows 95 and
Windows 95 OEM Service Releases 2 (OSR2):
<P>
<PRE>   DFS.VXD  version 4.10.1686  dated 2/6/98 7:26pm  18,147 bytes

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95 and
Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Releases 2 (OSR2). An update to address
this problem is now available, but is not fully regression tested and
should be applied only to computers experiencing this specific problem.
Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft does
not recommend implementing this update at this time. Contact Microsoft
Technical Support for additional information about the availability of
this update.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If drive letters are mapped to DFS shares on two different servers and you
change to a folder on the first drive letter and then change drives to the
second drive letter, the second drive letter may be mapped to the share
that the first drive letter was mapped to.
<P>
For example:

<OL><P><LI>Drive X is mapped to \\&lt;server1&gt;\&lt;share1&gt;, and drive Y is mapped to
   \\&lt;server2&gt;\&lt;share2&gt;.

<P><LI>At a command prompt, change to X:\&lt;folder1&gt;.

<P><LI>Change to drive Y.

<P><LI>Change to Y:\&lt;folder1&gt; (&lt;folder1&gt; exists only on drive X
   [\\&lt;server1&gt;\&lt;share1&gt;]).

<P><LI>Drive Y is now mapped to \\&lt;server1&gt;\&lt;share1&gt;.
<P>
</OL>If drive letters are mapped to DFS root shares on two different servers,
and each share contains a DFS volume mapping that points to same-named DFS
leaf shares on two other servers, the DFS volume object on one DFS root
share may display the contents of the DFS leaf share mapped to the other
DFS volume object when you change to a different folder.
<P>
For example:

<OL><P><LI>Drive X is mapped to \\&lt;server1&gt;\&lt;DFSRoot1&gt;, and drive Y is mapped to
   \\&lt;server1&gt;\&lt;DFSRoot2&gt;.

<P><LI>\\&lt;server1&gt;\&lt;DFSRoot1&gt; contains &lt;folder1&gt;, which is mapped to the DFS
   leaf share \\&lt;server3&gt;\Public.

<P><LI>\\&lt;server1&gt;\&lt;DFSRoot2&gt; contains &lt;folder2&gt;, which is mapped to the DFS
   leaf share \\&lt;server4&gt;\Public.

<P><LI>When you type "dir x:\&lt;folder1&gt;" (without quotation marks) at a command
   prompt, the contents of \\&lt;server3&gt;\Public is displayed as expected.

<P><LI>When you type "dir y:\&lt;folder2&gt;" (without quotation marks) at a command
   prompt, the contents of \\&lt;server3&gt;\Public is displayed instead of
   the contents of \\&lt;server4&gt;\Public.
