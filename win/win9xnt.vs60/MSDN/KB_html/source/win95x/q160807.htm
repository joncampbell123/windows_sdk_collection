The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
<LI>Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release versions 2, 2.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
You may experience problems connecting to a share on a Windows NT server
from a Windows 95 workstation if the Windows NT server has a large number
of shares.
<P>
Specific symptoms may include:

<UL><LI>When you attempt to make a UNC (Universal Naming Convention) connection
   to the share, the following error message may be displayed:
<P>
<P><PRE>      The folder "\\&lt;server&gt;\&lt;share&gt;" does not exist.
</PRE>
<LI>In Microsoft Word version 7.0 for Windows 95, when you change the
   default document location to a folder on the server, the File Open
   operation does not work. The current folder reverts to the desktop or
   the root folder of drive C. This may occur whether the share on the
   server is accessed using a mapped drive letter or a UNC connection.
<P>
</UL>- While using shortcuts you cannot get to lower level directories on the
<PRE>  Windows NT server. If you double click the shortcut - it connects to the
  servers share and displays folders, but when you double click the lower
  level folder all it does is refresh the upper level share points
  directories thus creating a shortcut loop.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
In some scenarios, Windows 95 determines whether a share exists on an SMB
server by getting the list of shares from the server, then searching for
the specified share name in the data returned. The SMB protocol used to
get the list of shares is limited to a total data size of 64K. If the list
of shares is too large, not all names fit within the 64K data block. If
the specified share is not included in the partial list returned, the
operation does not work.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this issue, use one or more of the following methods:

<UL><LI>Reduce the number of shares on the Windows NT server.

<LI>Reduce the length of the share names on the server.

<LI>Reduce the length of the comments on the shares.
<P>
</UL>Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95. A
fix to this problem is in development, but has not been regression tested
and may be destabilizing in production environments. Microsoft does not
recommend implementing this fix at this time. Contact Microsoft Technical
Support for more information on the availability of this fix.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This symptom is typically encountered if the number of shares on the
Windows NT server exceeds 1,000 shares, or if the shares generally have
long comment strings.
