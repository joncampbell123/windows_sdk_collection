The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
<LI>Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release versions 1, 2, 2.1, 2.5
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When a user with sufficient permissions to change file attributes logs on
to a Windows 95-based computer that has system policies enabled, the
Config.pol file attributes are set to "archive". All other file
attributes, such as "read only", are removed. This would allow
unrestricted editing of the policy, which may have undesired effects on
subsequent user logins.
<P>
This problem applies to both the Client for Microsoft Networks, and the
Client for NetWare Networks, and is typically manifested when an
administrative user logs in.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs because the program that applies the system policy
explicitly sets the archive bit, which results in the clearing of all
other file attributes.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
This issue is resolved by the following updated file for Windows 95, all
versions:
<P>
<PRE>   MPRSERV.DLL version 4.00.958  dated 2/25/98 09:58am  127,488 bytes

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95
(retail release), and Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Releases 2 (OSR2)
and 2.1 (OSR2.1). An update to address this problem is now available, but
is not fully regression tested and should be applied only to computers
experiencing this specific problem. Unless you are severely impacted by
this specific problem, Microsoft does not recommend implementing this
update at this time. Contact Microsoft Technical Support for additional
information about the availability of this update.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The updated component ensures that the original file attributes are
correctly applied after the policies are enforced.
