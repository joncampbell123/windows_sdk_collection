<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you try to browse the entire network in Network Neighborhood by
double-clicking the Entire Network icon, some of the domains on your
network may not appear. The alphabetized list that appears may be only a
partial listing. This problem may be more severe if you are using TCP/IP
as your only network protocol and you are using Windows Internet Name
Service (WINS) for NetBIOS resolution.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When you are browsing the network, Windows 95 stores the domain names in
a table that is limited to 64K in size. When this table is full, no more
domains are displayed.
<P>
In addition, many WINS servers have a known side effect that causes them
to report that domains exist, even after these domains have been removed
from the network. This can occur on networks where domains are frequently
removed shortly after they are created. This problem may prevent domains
that currently exist on the network from being displayed in Network
Neighborhood.
