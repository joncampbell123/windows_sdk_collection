The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
<LI>Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release version 2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you are using Microsoft Backup to back up data to certain models of
floppy disk drives, you may receive the following error messages:

<UL><LI>Warning: Tape needs to be erased before operation can proceed.

<LI>Microsoft Backup unable to read from the disk or network drive.
   Quit and restart Backup, and then try again.

<LI>Warning: This operation has been canceled by the system.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Some models of floppy disk drives require specific timing and delays
between disk operations to work properly. The timing implemented by the
Windows 95 floppy disk driver is not sufficient for some of these drives.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
There are two separate timing issues known to relate to this symptom:

<UL><LI>Some floppy disk drives require a specific minimum delay time after a
   Write operation, before a Step operation can occur.

<LI>Some floppy disk drives require a specific minimum head-settling time
   between a Seek and subsequent Write operation.
<P>
</UL>In each of these cases, the delay required by the drive is greater than
the Windows 95 floppy disk driver implements.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95. A
fix to this problem is in development, but has not been regression tested
and may be destabilizing in production environments. Microsoft does not
recommend implementing the fix at this time. Contact Microsoft Technical
Support for more information about the availability of this fix.
