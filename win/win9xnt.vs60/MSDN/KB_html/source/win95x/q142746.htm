<P>
<P><h3>Setting Up a Workgroup Post Office</h3>
 
<P>
To set up a Microsoft Exchange workgroup post office, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>In Control Panel, double-click Microsoft Mail Postoffice.

<P><LI>Click Create A New Workgroup Postoffice, and then click Next.

<P><LI>Type the path for the post office in the Postoffice Location box, and
   then click Next. The post office can be located on your local hard
   disk, or on a network drive. It must be placed in a location that can
   be accessed by all the users who have accounts on the post office.
<P>
   NOTE: A folder named Wgpo0000 is created in the location you specify.
   Numerous folders are created in the Wgpo0000 folder, all of which must
   be present for the post office to function correctly.

<P><LI>Click Next to confirm the location of the new workgroup post office.

<P><LI>In the Enter Your Administrator Account Details dialog box, type the
   appropriate information about the post office administrator, and then
   click OK. Only the Name, Mailbox, and Password fields are required.
<P>
   NOTE: The Name field represents the name that other Microsoft Exchange
   users use to identify the post office administrator. The Mailbox field
   represents the name that the workgroup post office uses to identify the
   post office administrator. The Mailbox name is normally assigned by the
   Microsoft Workgroup Postoffice Admin Wizard automatically, and cannot
   contain spaces.

<P><LI>Click OK in the dialog box that appears.
<P>
</OL>To allow users who have accounts on the post office to access the post
office, you must share the folder containing the post office. To do so,
follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>In Windows Explorer or My Computer, use the right mouse button to
   click the folder containing the post office, and then click Properties
   on the menu that appears.

<P><LI>Click the Sharing tab.

<P><LI>Click Shared As and then verify the name of the post office in the
   Share Name box. If you want to add a comment in addition to the share
   name, type the comment in the Comment box. The comment is seen by
   other users when they view a list of computers on the network.

<P><LI>To allow all users to access the post office, click Full Access and
   then click OK. To restrict access to the post office by requiring a
   password, click Depends On Password, type the password in the Full
   Access Password box, and then click OK.
<P>
</OL><h3>Administering a Workgroup Post Office</h3>
 
<P>
To administer a Microsoft Exchange workgroup post office, follow these
steps:

<OL><P><LI>In Control Panel, double-click Microsoft Mail Postoffice.

<P><LI>Click Administer An Existing Workgroup Postoffice, and then click
   Next.

<P><LI>Type the path for the post office in the Postoffice Location box, and
   then click Next.

<P><LI>Type the mailbox name and password assigned to the post office
   administrator during the creation of the workgroup post office in the
   Mailbox and Password boxes, and then click Next.

<P><LI>To add a new user to the workgroup post office, click Add User, type
   the appropriate information about the user, and then click OK. Only the
   Name, Mailbox, and Password fields are required. To remove a user from
   the workgroup post office, click the user's name in the list of users,
   and then click Remove User. To modify the information about a user,
   click the user's name in the list of users, and then click Details.
