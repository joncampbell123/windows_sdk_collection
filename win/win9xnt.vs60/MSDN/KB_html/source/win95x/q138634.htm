The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, you should first make a backup copy of the
registry files (System.dat and User.dat). Both are hidden files in the
Windows folder.
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you try to dial by using Online Registration, HyperTerminal, or MSN,
The Microsoft Network, you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Modem is busy or not responding.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
You may receive the error message if any of the following conditions are
true:

<UL><LI>The port is being controlled by another communications program.

<LI>The port settings are in conflict with another device.

<LI>The registry contains incorrect or damaged communications settings.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
If the port is being controlled by another communications program, close
the other communications program.
<P>
This situation usually occurs when a 16-bit program is open (possibly
minimized). The only way that multiple programs can use the port is for the
controlling program and the requesting program to be TAPI aware. The TAPI
specification allows for the controlling program to relinquish control of
the port to the requesting program.
<P>
If the port settings are in conflict with another device, follow these
steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel
   on the menu that appears.

<P><LI>In Control Panel, double-click the Systems icon.

<P><LI>In Systems Properties, click the Performance tab, and then click
   Graphics.

<P><LI>In Advanced Graphics Settings, move the Hardware acceleration slider
   to None.
<P>
</OL>By default, COM1 and COM3 use IRQ4, while COM2 and COM4 use IRQ3.
If another device is sharing the IRQ of the port, you need to change the
IRQ of the conflicting device. Hardware conflicts can also occur with the
I/O address of the COM port. The 8514a video chip or its clones (S3
chip set) on some video cards create a conflict with COM4 because
they use the same address of 02E8.
<P>
If the Windows 95 Registry contains incorrect or corrupt communications
settings, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel
   on the menu that appears.

<P><LI>In Control Panel, double-click the Modems icon.

<P><LI>In Modems properties, click the modem, and then click Properties.

<P><LI>Click the General tab, and then click the Only Connect At This Speed
   check box to clear it.

<P><LI>Click the Connection tab, and then click the Disconnect A Call If Idle
   check box to clear it.

<P><LI>Click Advanced, and then click the Use Flow Control check box to clear
   it.

<P><LI>Click OK or Close until you return to Control Panel.
<P>
</OL>If you are having problems with a Compaq modem, contact Compaq to inquire
about obtaining a file that may correct this problem. Follow the
instructions in the Readme.txt file included in this file.
<P>
If you still receive the "Modem is busy or not responding" error message
after you complete these troubleshooting tips, follow these steps.
<P>
NOTE: For information about how to edit the registry, view the Changing
Keys And Values online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Note
that you should make a backup copy of the registry files (System.dat and
User.dat) before you edit the registry.
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall Windows 95. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved.
Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

<OL><P><LI>Make a copy of your registry by typing the following command at an
   MS-DOS prompt:
<P>
<P><PRE>      CD\&lt;windows folder&gt; (where &lt;windows folder&gt; is the name of your
<PRE></PRE>                           Windows folder)
      ATTRIB -R -A -S -H System.dat
      COPY System.dat SYSTEM.PSS
      ATTRIB +R +A +S +H System.dat

</PRE><P><LI>On the Desktop, click the Start button, and then click Run.

<P><LI>In the Open box, type "Regedit" (without the quotation marks).

<P><LI>In Registry Editor, double-click each of the following items:
<P>
<P><PRE>      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Class\Modem\
      0000\Settings
</PRE>
<P><LI>Under Name, using the right mouse button, click FlowControl_Hard, and
   then click Modify on the menu that appears. In Edit String, delete
   the data under Value data.

<P><LI>Under Name, using the right mouse button, click InactivityTimeout, and
   then click Modify on the menu that appears. In Edit String, delete
   the data under Value data.

<P><LI>Under Name, using the right mouse button, click SpeedNegotiation_On,
   and then click Modify on the menu that appears. In Edit String, delete
   the data under Value data.
<P>
   NOTE: Do not delete the Value name; delete only the Value data.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
