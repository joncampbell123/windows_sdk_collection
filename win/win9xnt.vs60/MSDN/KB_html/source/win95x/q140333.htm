The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, you should first make a backup copy of the
registry files (System.dat and User.dat). Both are hidden files in the
Windows folder.
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how to add an object to the list of objects that
appears when you click the File menu in Windows Explorer and then point to
New, or when you point to New on a context menu.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
A context menu is displayed when you use the right mouse button to click
an object in Windows 95. For example, if you use the right mouse button to
click the desktop, a menu is displayed that contains several commands. You
can choose one of these commands by clicking the command on the context
menu.
<P>
One of the commands on the context menu that appears when you use the
right mouse button to click the desktop is the New command. This command
appears on many other context menus, and also on the File menu in Windows
Explorer. If you point to the New command on one of these menus, a list of
objects appears. You can create a new object by clicking one of the
objects on this list.
<P>
To add an object to the list of objects, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Start the program that is used to create the type of object you want to
   add to the object list, and then save a blank or empty object in the
   Windows\Shellnew folder. For example, if you want to add Microsoft Word
   for Windows documents to the object list, start Word for Windows, and
   then save an empty Word for Windows document in the Windows\Shellnew
   folder.
<P>
   NOTE: The Windows\Shellnew folder already contains some objects that
   are created by commonly used programs. For example, the Winword.doc
   file found in the Windows\Shellnew folder is a blank Word for Windows
   document. If the type of object that you want to add to the object list
   is already in the Windows\Shellnew folder, you can skip step 1 and
   proceed to step 2.

<P><LI>NOTE: For information about how to edit the registry, view the Changing
   Keys And Values online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe).
   Note that you should make a backup copy of the registry files
   (System.dat and User.dat) before you edit the registry.
<P>
   WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems
   that may require you to reinstall Windows 95. Microsoft cannot
   guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry
   Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
   Create a new registry key called "Shellnew" (without quotation marks)
   under the following registry key
<P>
<P><PRE>      Hkey_Classes_Root\&lt;.ext&gt;
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;.ext&gt; is the default file extension used for the type of object
   you want to add to the object list. For example, if you want to add
   Word for Windows documents to the object list, add a new registry key
   called "Shellnew" under the following registry key:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Hkey_Classes_Root\.doc
</PRE>
<P><LI>Create a new string value called "Filename" (without quotation marks)
   under the registry key that you created in step 3.

<P><LI>Modify the Filename registry value that you created in step 4 so that
   it is assigned the following value
<P>
<P><PRE>      c:\&lt;windows&gt;\shellnew\&lt;object&gt;
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;windows&gt; is the Windows folder, and &lt;object&gt; is the blank or
   empty object that you saved to the Windows\Shellnew folder in step 1.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: You do not need to restart your computer for the new object to
appear in the object list.
