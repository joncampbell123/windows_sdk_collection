<P><h3>Introduction</h3>
 
<P>
Windows 95 System Check is a tool that performs a basic test of your
computer's hardware and software to ensure compatibility with Windows
95. Windows 95 System Check is not intended as a comprehensive
diagnostics tool to check for every known Windows 95 incompatibility.
Instead, this tool is designed to answer some common questions you
might have before you upgrade to Windows 95.
<P>
<P><h3>How to Use Windows 95 System Check</h3>
 
<P>
You can run Windows 95 System Check in Windows version 3.x, Windows
for Workgroups version 3.x, Microsoft Windows NT(TM) version 3.x, and
IBM(R) OS/2(R). If you want to run Windows 95 System Check in Windows
version 3.0, make sure that the Ver.dll file included with this
Application Note is in the same folder from which you run Windows 95
System Check (W95check.exe). These files do not need to be on the hard
disk in order for you to run Windows 95 System Check.
<P>
To run Windows 95 System Check, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Program Manager File menu, click Run.

<P><LI>Type the following line in the Command Line box, and then press
   ENTER
<P>
<P><PRE>      &lt;source&gt;:\w95check
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;source&gt; is the drive letter of the floppy disk drive
   containing the WW1247 disk, or the folder containing the Ww1247.exe
   file you downloaded from an online service and extracted. (To
   extract the Ww1247.exe file, switch to the drive or folder
   containing the file, and then type "ww1247" without the quotation
   marks.) For example, if you inserted the WW1247 disk in drive A,
   type the following line:
<P>
<P><PRE>      a:\w95check
</PRE><P>
   Or, if you downloaded the Ww1247.exe file from an online service to
   the C:\Download folder, type the following line:
<P>
<P><PRE>      c:\download\w95check
</PRE>
<P><LI>Follow the instructions on the screen.
<P>
</OL>If you are already running Windows 95, Windows 95 System Check quits
without performing a scan. For additional information about hardware
and software compatibility issues, see the text files included with
your copy of Windows 95, or consult the documentation included with
the "Windows 95 Resource Kit."
<P>
<P><h3>How Windows 95 System Check Works</h3>
 
<P>
Windows 95 System Check scans your computer for the following
information:

<UL><LI>Processor--It checks your computer's CPU to determine if it meets the
   minimum requirement for Windows 95. It also checks for older
   versions of the 80386 processor that are incompatible with Windows
   95.

<LI>Memory (RAM) --It checks the amount of physical memory (RAM) in your
   computer to determine if it meets the minimum requirement for
   Windows 95.

<LI>Disk Space--It checks the amount of free disk space on the hard
   disk that contains your existing operating system to determine if
   it meets the minimum (and recommended) requirements for Windows 95.
   It also checks for swap file and boot-drive disk space on hard
   disks that use disk compression.

<LI>Programs--It scans the top three folder levels of all the hard disks
   in your computer for Windows-based programs with significant known
   compatibility issues with Windows 95. Note that for most of these
   programs, upgrades that are fully compatible with Windows 95 are
   now or soon will be available.
<P>
   NOTE: If Windows 95 System Check does not detect any programs on
   your computer with known compatibility issues, the Your Programs
   page of Windows 95 System Check is skipped.
<P>
</UL>Windows 95 System Check does not perform any of the following tests:

<UL><LI>It does not perform diagnostic tests for hard disk problems (such
   as problems that might be found by hard disk tools such as
   Microsoft ScanDisk).

<LI>It does not detect peripheral hardware devices connected to your
   computer (such as modems and fax/modems).

<LI>It does not perform an analysis or detection of installed
   network resources, network protocols, or network adapters.

<LI>It does not check for computer viruses.

<LI>It does not check program compatibility on shared network
   resources.

<LI>It does not distinguish between 386/SX and 386/DX processors. A
   386/DX or better processor is the minimum requirement for Windows
   95 to ensure good performance. If your computer has a 386/SX
   processor, you can run Windows 95, but performance may be slower.
<P>
</UL>The Windows 95 Setup program provides warnings for most of the
problems associated with upgrading to Windows 95. In fact, Windows 95
Setup checks the first three items in the above list.
