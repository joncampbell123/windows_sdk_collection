<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the Windows 95 DriveSpace compression utility to delete a
compressed drive, the following error message is displayed:
<P>
<PRE>   Windows cannot perform this operation because the enhanced
   mode disk compression driver could not be loaded. You may
   need to run setup again to install additional disk components.
   DRVSPACE 545

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs if the Windows 95 protected-mode DriveSpace driver
(DRVSPACX.VXD) is missing or corrupted. In such cases, Windows 95 loads the
real-mode DriveSpace driver. Deletion operations are not possible with the
real-mode driver.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To correct this problem, extract the file DRVSPACX.VXD from the original
Windows 95 disks or CD-ROM. To extract the file, perform the following
steps:

<OL><P><LI>Rename the DRVSPACX.VXD file on your hard disk. This file should be
   located in the WINDOWS\SYSTEM\IOSUBSYS subdirectory.
<P>
   a. To rename this file, first click the Start button on the taskbar.
<P><PRE>      On the Find menu, click Files Or Folders.
</PRE><P>
   b. In the Find: All Files dialog box, type "drvspacx.vxd" (without the
<P><PRE>      quotation marks) in the Named box. Click the Find Now button.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      NOTE: If DRVSPACX.VXD is missing, that is, it is not found on the
      hard disk that contains Windows 95, skip to step 2 below.
</PRE><P>
   c. In the file listing box, use the right (secondary) mouse button to
<P><PRE>      click the file DRVSPACX.VXD and then click Rename. Rename the file
      DRVSPACX.OLD and then press ENTER.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      NOTE: It is important that you use an extension other than .VXD when
      renaming files.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Extract a new DRVSPACX.VXD from the Windows 95 disks to the
   WINDOWS\SYSTEM\IOSUBSYS subdirectory. To extract the file, insert Disk
   11 in the floppy disk drive, or insert the Windows 95 Setup CD in the
   CD-ROM drive, then follow the steps below.
<P>
   a. On the taskbar, click Start. On Programs menu, click MS-DOS Prompt.
<P>
   b. At the command line, type the following
<P>
<PRE>         extract /l &lt;drive letter&gt;:\windows\system\iosubsys
         &lt;drive letter&gt;:\A drvspacx.vxd

      where &lt;drive letter&gt; indicates the letter designating the drive
      containing the floppy disk or CD-ROM.

</PRE><P><LI>Restart the system.
<P>
   NOTE: For additional information about the EXTRACT command, type
   "extract /?" (without the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS prompt.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If DRVSPACX.VXD becomes corrupted or is accidentally deleted from the
system, the real-mode driver loads by default. DriveSpace cannot perform
any operation using the real-mode driver while running under Windows 95.
However, some operations (such as unmount and change letter) can be
performed by making changes to the DRVSPACE.INI file and then restarting
the system. However, the FORMAT and DELETE commands cannot be performed
without the full support of the file system. These commands cannot be run
with the real-mode driver.
