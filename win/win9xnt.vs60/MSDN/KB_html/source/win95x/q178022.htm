<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When a program issues a synchronous NetBIOS SEND (SEND_WAIT) command using
Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) on a Windows 95-
based computer, the command immediately returns indicating successful
completion, even if the computer to which the command is sent does not
receive the data at the NetBIOS layer. Specifically, the SEND command may
be completed even if the recipient does not post a NetBIOS RECEIVE Network
Control Block (NCB).
<P>
This may be a problem if the sending program terminates the session
immediately after the synchronous SEND command is completed. If the
recipient computer posts a NetBIOS RECEIVE NCB after it acknowledges the
TCP/IP data, the sent data may no longer be available to be received.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft TCP/IP protocol included with Windows 95 acknowledges the
receipt of NetBIOS data before the data is received at the NetBIOS layer,
even if a NetBIOS RECEIVE NCB has not been posted.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95 and
OEM Service Release 2 (OSR2). An update to address this problem is now
available, but is not fully regression-tested and should be applied only
to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you are severely
impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft does not recommend
implementing this update at this time. Contact Microsoft Technical Support
for additional information about the availability of this update.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design. However, the behavior of the NCBSENDWAIT
command over TCP/IP is inconsistent with the behavior of the NCBSENDWAIT
command over other protocols included with Windows 95 (such as
Internetwork Packet Exchange/Sequenced Packet Exchange [IPX/SPX]-
compatible protocol and NetBIOS Enhanced User Interface [NetBEUI]
protocol). With other protocols, the NCBSENDWAIT command does not return
until the recipient receives the data at the NetBIOS layer.
<P>
This behavior may be undesirable if a program sends NetBIOS data, then
terminates as soon as the SEND command is returned. Instead, if the
program posts a NetBIOS RECEIVE command and waits for the recipient to
complete the receive, this behavior has no adverse impact.
