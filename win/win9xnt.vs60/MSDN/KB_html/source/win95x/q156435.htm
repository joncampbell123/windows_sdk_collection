<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how to interpret the Ppplog.txt file. It also
provides information about background concepts used in the development of
the Point-to-Point protocol (PPP) and its peripheral components.
<P>
References to an IETF Request-for-Comments (RFC) can be followed by
locating the RFC, by number, at the following Web site:
<P>
<PRE>   <B>http://ds.internic.net/ds/rfc-index.html</B>

</PRE>Because PPP is the predominant connection type used today, this article
focuses primarily on interpreting the Ppplog.txt file when a PPP
connection is used. Information not related to troubleshooting, but
instrumental in understanding the framework of PPP, is also provided.
<P>
<P><h3>Notes</h3>
 

<UL><LI>Excerpts from Ppplog.txt files in this article have been edited for
   readability. Specifically, the date stamp has been removed and the
   time stamp has been reduced to the format [seconds.tenths-of-a-
   second]. Comments are at the bottom of each listing. For the sake of
   brevity, unnecessary lines may have been removed. Where this has been
   done, ellipses have been placed between the line numbers.

<LI>The term "peer(s)" is used in this article to describe either or both
   computers involved in a connection.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Enabling Ppplog.txt File Generation</h3>
 
<P>
The Ppplog.txt file is generated by Pppmac.vxd, also known as the Dial-Up
Adapter. The file is appended each time the Dial-Up Adapter is used. To
enable the generation of a Ppplog.txt file, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>In Control Panel, double-click Network.

<P><LI>On the Configuration tab, double-click the Dial-Up Adapter.

<P><LI>Click the Advanced tab.

<P><LI>In the Property box, click Record A Log File.

<P><LI>In the Value box, click Yes.

<P><LI>Click OK or Close until you return to Control Panel. When you are
   prompted to restart your computer, do so.
<P>
</OL>The next time you use the Dial-Up Adapter, the Ppplog.txt file is created
in the Windows folder.
<P>
<P><h3>Frame and Packet Structure</h3>
 
<P>
The structures are listed in OSI model order, from the data-link layer up.
Individual protocol structures are not included; that level of complexity
exceeds the scope and purpose of this article. A complete HDLC-framed PPP
packet has the following structure:
<P>
<PRE>   [-Flag-|-Address-|-Control-|-Protocol-|-Information-|-Padding-|-FCS-|-
   Flag-]

</PRE></OL>This structure can be broken into the following two logical parts:
<P>
HDLC Framing of PPP Data:
<P>
<PRE>   [-Flag-|-Address-|-Control-|-PPP Encapsulation-|-FCS-|-Flag-]

</PRE>The PPP frame's beginning and end is marked by a Flag sequence. In a data
stream, the end of one frame and the beginning of the next is not noted by
the presence of consecutive Flags; only one is needed. The field's length
is one octet, and its value is always 01111110 (0x7e).
<P>
Because PPP deals with point-to-point connections, the majority of
implementations do not support individual addressing of PPP frames. The
address that is used and must be supported by all implementations of PPP
is the All-Stations broadcast address: 11111111 (0xff).
<P>
The Control field is a single octet in length and, unless negotiated
otherwise, has the value 00000011 (0x03).
<P>
PPP Encapsulation is covered below.
<P>
The Frame Check Sequence (FCS) is the checksum for the frame. It can be
two or four octets (16- or 32-bit value) in length. The FCS defaults to
the 16-bit value. It is calculated using the Address, Control, Protocol,
Information, and Padding fields. Excluded are bits or octets inserted at
the physical layer for transmission (synchronous or asynchronous) framing
purposes, the FCS and Flag fields, and any bits that are flagged for
transparent transmission in the Asynchronous Control Character Map (the
ACCM is described later in this article).
<P>
PPP Encapsulation:
<P>
<PRE>   [-Protocol-|-Information-|-Padding-]

</PRE>The Protocol field can be either one or two octets in length, depending
on whether protocol field compression is being used. It indicates the
protocol contained within the PPP frame. With PPP, protocol identification
numbers are based on the ISO 3309 extension mechanism for address fields.
This states that if address field identifiers comply with the format
stated in ISO 3309, implementations of PPP can reliably compress a 16-bit
(2-octet) field down to an 8-bit (single octet) field while retaining all
necessary information.
<P>
The Information field consists of zero or more octets, which, including
padding octets, does not exceed the Maximum Receivable Unit (MRU) length
negotiated for the connection.
<P>
The Padding field is optional, and any data used as padding must be easily
discernible as such by the peers. If padding data is included, and exceeds
the MRU, it is discarded silently.
<P>
<P><h3>Control Mechanisms</h3>
 
<P>
In order to properly interpret the Ppplog.txt file, read the following
section to familiarize yourself with PPP's underlying control mechanisms
and the phases the connection passes through.
<P>
<P><h3>Finite-State Automaton (FSA)</h3>
 
<P>
The FSA processes status messages from different layers, and then, after
evaluating the message, tells other layers what they should do next. In
general, the FSA relates information from layer to layer, without actually
interacting in the exchange of data. For example, if the physical layer
(modem-to-modem connection) is interrupted, the FSA notifies the network
layer that it can no longer function, and must shut down. The automaton is
said to exist in "states." The progress of the connection is dependent on
the current state of the automaton.
<P>
<P><h3>Link Control Protocol (LCP)</h3>
 
<P>
The link control protocol's job is to manage the data-link layer. It sets
up, configures, and tests the connection. There are three classes of LCP
packets:

<OL><P><LI>Link Configuration packets establish and configure the link.

<P><LI>Link Termination packets terminate the link.

<P><LI>Link Maintenance packets manage and test the link.
<P>
</OL>Knowing the three classes of packets is important because a malfunctioning
implementation of PPP can be indicated by the presence of a certain class
of packet appearing at an inappropriate time. You may also see this
behavior if the connection between the two peers is poor or the modems are
misconfigured or malfunctioning. More information about the specific
packets within each class and their relevance to the Ppplog.txt file is
contained in the "Parsing the Ppplog.txt File" section of this article.
<P>
<P><h3>Network Control Protocol (NCP)</h3>
 
<P>
An NCP is a "protocol manager." Each protocol that is used in the
connection has an NCP. They work with the LCP to get the protocols up and
ready to be used. When an NCP has opened, it is possible for network-layer
traffic to be carried by the protocol that the NCP configured. NCPs are
not defined in the same RFC as the Point-to-Point protocol. They are
defined separately, and as such are not covered in detail in this article.
<P>
<P><h3>Phase Breakdown</h3>
 
<P>
A PPP session consists of five distinct phases. Ppplog.txt file entries
are more readily understood based on what happens during these phases.
When common failures in a phase in Windows 95 are referenced, any
existing Microsoft Knowledge Base articles about that failure are
referred to.
<P>
<P><h3>Link-Dead</h3>
 
<P>
Every PPP connection starts in the Link-Dead condition. In this condition,
the physical layer is said to be "Down," and the FSA "Closed." In a
switched circuit such as a modem connection over a telephone line, this
condition exists when the modems are not connected. In a continuous
connection, such as a leased line, there is usually some mechanism in
place that enables the hardware to signal PPP that the link is available.
When a carrier has been negotiated or the connection established, the
hardware-handling routines signal the FSA that they can carry traffic,
and PPP moves on to the Link Establishment phase.
<P>
<P><h3>Link Establishment</h3>
 
<P>
In the Link Establishment phase, the LCP configures and establishes the
data-link layer. Its aim is to provide a solid foundation on top of which
the network layer can operate. This process primarily involves the
exchange of Class 1 LCP packets, and starts when one peer receives a
Configure-Request packet from another. When all configuration options
have been negotiated, a Configure-Ack packet is returned to the peer that
initiated negotiation. At this point, the layer is up and PPP can proceed
to the next phase.
<P>
The following example illustrates a hypothetical conversation between two
peers, Peer1 and Peer2. Each line represents a packet being transmitted.
The peer sending the packet is listed in parentheses, and the packet type
is listed in brackets. When the peer sending the packet is noted as
"PeerN(a,b,c)," a possible response to a request is being noted, not
sequential packets from the same peer.
<P>
Synopsis:
<P>
<PRE> (Peer1)-[Configure-Request]: Contains information about all configuration
 options to be negotiated. All options are negotiated simultaneously.

 (Peer2a)-[Configure-Ack]: If the peer receiving the Configure-Request
 accepts all configuration options, it returns a Configure-Ack. Receipt of
 a Configure- Ack signals the end of LCP configuration.

 (Peer2b)-[Configure-Nak]: If the peer receiving the Configure-Request
 accepts all of the configuration option fields but not all the values of
 the fields, it must send a Configure-Nak. The Configure-Nak packet
 specifies which option field values were not acceptable and suggests
 changes to the peer.

 (Peer2c)-[Configure-Reject]: Indicates to the peer that some of the
 option fields requested for negotiation are unrecognizable or
 unacceptable. The peer must send a new Configure-Request, omitting
 the rejected option fields.

 (Peer1)-[Configure-Request]
 .
 .
 .
 (Peer2)-[Configure-Ack]

 (Link configuration complete)

</PRE></OL>It is important to note that because the majority of Windows 95 PPP
connections are asynchronous, according to RFC 1662 the following
configuration options will always be negotiated:
<P>
<PRE> Asynchronous Control Character Map
 Magic Number
 Address and Control Field Compression
 Protocol Field Compression

</PRE>These options may not necessarily be negotiated in the order shown.
<P>
<P><h3>Authentication</h3>
 
<P>
When the link has been configured, the FSA changes state to "Opened." The
next step for the PPP connection is the Authentication phase. If a client
fails to successfully authenticate itself, or if the host cannot
authenticate the client for some reason, the connection is terminated.
<P>
Usually, failure at this stage is due to an incorrect user name, password,
logon domain, or preferred server entry. If this is the case, a User Logon
dialog box is displayed, prompting for the correct information. For
additional information about this dialog box, see the following article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../zmiscellaneous/q148899.htm">Q148899</A></B>
   TITLE     : Dial-Up Networking Dialog Box Prompts for Domain Name

</PRE>Depending on the protocol used for authentication, the client may be given
an infinite number of logon attempts, although usually the limit is three.
These protocols are described later in this article.
<P>
<P><h3>Network Layer Configuration</h3>
 
<P>
After successful authentication, the last step is to configure and open
all network protocols that have been selected on each peer. The NCP for a
given network-layer protocol takes care of any configuration options that
need to be negotiated. When option negotiation is finished, the protocol
is opened and can begin carrying network-layer traffic. If one peer is not
configured to use a protocol that the other peer is attempting to use, it
returns the packet in a Protocol-Reject. A Protocol-Reject is a Class 3
LCP packet. The message shown in the Ppplog.txt file when a Protocol-
Reject is sent or received is covered in the "Parsing the Ppplog.txt File"
section of this article. Upon receipt of a Protocol-Reject packet, the
peer must stop using the protocol contained within the packet. In Windows
95, if both sides reject all protocols, a dialog box is displayed
indicating that this situation has occurred. For additional information
about this dialog box, see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../win95x/q130079.htm">Q130079</A></B>
   TITLE     : Dial-Up Networking Could Not Negotiate Compatible...

</PRE>The following example uses the same conventions as the previous example
for LPC option negotiation.
<P>
Synopsis:
<P>
<PRE> (Peer1)-[8021 NCP packet]: Peer1 transmits a packet over the link
 containing the Internet Protocol Control Protocol (PPP ID# 8021).

 (Peer2)-&lt;receives packet&gt;: Peer2 receives the packet, and upon inspection
 of the protocol identifier field, does not recognize the protocol being
 used. In Windows 95, this translates into one of the following three
 scenarios: the protocol is disabled in the connectoid, the protocol is
 not bound to the Dial-Up Adapter, or the protocol is not loaded on the
 computer. The message generated in the Ppplog.txt file is covered later.

 (Peer2)-[Protocol-Reject]: Peer2 encapsulates a stripped-down version of
 the unsupported packet inside a Protocol-Reject packet, and returns it to
 Peer1.

 (Peer1)-[Protocol-Reject]: Peer1 receives the Protocol-Reject, and upon
 inspection of the protocol identifier field, immediately shuts down the
 protocol.

 (Protocol-Reject complete)

</PRE><h3>Link Termination</h3>
 
<P>
Link Termination can be caused by a number of events. These events
include, but are not limited to: link failure (loss of carrier),
authentication failure, and failure to negotiate at least one network
protocol. Link Termination is affected by the exchange of Class 2 LCP
packets. When the link begins the process of closing down, the network
layer is notified that physical transport services are about to become
nonexistent. Any non-LCP packets received during this time are discarded.
When both sides have disconnected, PPP returns to the Link-Dead phase.
<P>
Synopsis:
<P>
<PRE> (Peer1)-[Terminate-Request]: When one peer wants to close the connection
 it can send a Terminate-Request.

 (Peer2)-[Terminate-Ack]: Upon reception of a Terminate-Request, a peer
 must respond with a Terminate-Ack.

 (Connection closed)

</PRE><h3>Parsing the Ppplog.txt File</h3>
 
<P>
The following sections are divided into loosely categorized groupings of
messages. They are not necessarily listed in order of appearance, and a
message listed here may not appear in every Ppplog.txt file.
<P>
<P><h3>State Transition Messages</h3>
 
<P>
Messages that indicate a layer's transition from one state to another
appear frequently, and occur in several forms: Started, Up, Down, and
Finished. The message can be prefixed and suffixed with information
detailing its origin and what particular part of the session it is
reporting about.
<P>
NOTE: The status messages described below use the following conventions
for describing variables that may change in different instances of the
message:

<UL><LI>"aaa" is an abbreviation or acronym referring to the source of the
   message.
<LI>CHAP: acronym for Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol
<LI>PAP: acronym for Password Authentication Protocol
<LI>ND: acronym for No Description, this is the Shiva-PAP (SPAP)
<P>
</UL>aaa: Layer Started:
<P>
This message, when prefixed with:

<UL><LI>LCP: Indicates the beginning of configuration option negotiation.

<LI>CHAP, PAP, or ND: Indicates the beginning of user authentication.

<LI>NCP: Indicates that the NCP for a particular network-layer protocol has
   begun configuration negotiation.
<P>
</UL>aaa: Layer Up:
<P>
This message, when prefixed with:

<UL><LI>LCP: Indicates the completion of configuration option negotiation.

<LI>CHAP, PAP, or ND: Indicates that the user logged on successfully.

<LI>NCP: Indicates that the protocol's negotiation options were
   successfully negotiated with the peer.
<P>
</UL>aaa: Layer Down:
<P>
This message, when prefixed with:

<UL><LI>LCP: Indicates that a Terminate-Request packet has been received and
   acknowledged.

<LI>CHAP, PAP, or ND: Is displayed as a formality, all protocols are closed
   when the link is being terminated.

<LI>NCP: Indicates that the network-layer activity of this protocol has
   been stopped, usually due to link termination.
<P>
</UL>aaa: Layer Finished:
<P>
This message, when prefixed with:

<UL><LI>LCP: Indicates that the link has proceeded to the Link-Dead phase.

<LI>NCP: Indicates that the NCP has completely ceased operation.
<P>
</UL><h3>Static Status Messages</h3>
 
<P>
Static messages appear in every Ppplog.txt file, at the beginning of each
new addition to the log file. They serve little purpose other than to
provide a familiar point of reference when you are trying to distinguish
where one session starts and another ends.
<P>
NOTE: The status messages described below may use the following
conventions for describing variables that may change in different
instances of the message:

<UL><LI>"aaaa" is an acronym for the server type.
<LI>"bbbb" is a friendly name for the server type.
<P>
</UL>Remote Access Driver Log Opened:
<P>
This line is the first line in the Ppplog.txt file. It is written when the
file is opened, and control of the connection is handed to Pppmac.vxd from
TAPI.
<P>
No Installable CP VxDs Are Loaded:
<P>
The architecture of Pppmac.vxd allows for installable Control Protocols to
be added in the form of a virtual device driver (VxD). Windows 95 includes
only one: Spap.vxd. In addition, the following registry key contains the
list of installable VxDs currently in use on the computer:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\VxD\PPP\CPList

</PRE>The entries listed in this key are string values consisting of a
description of the protocol for the value name, and the actual VxD file
name for the value data.
<P>
Installable CP VxD SPAP Is Loaded:
<P>
This line indicates that the Shiva Password Authentication Protocol has
been loaded.
<P>
Server Type Is aaaa (bbbb):
<P>
This message displays the type of connection being attempted. Note that
although all of the following server types listed are supported by the
Windows95 Dial-Up Networking client, Dial-Up Networking Server accepts
only RAS and PPP connections:

<UL><LI>RAS: Remote Access Server
<LI>PPP: Point-to-Point protocol
<LI>NRN: NetWare Connect (version 1.0 only)
<LI>SLIP: Serial Line Internet protocol
<LI>CSLIP: Compressed SLIP (uses Van Jacobson IP header compression)
<P>
</UL>Note that SLIP, CSLIP, and Dial-Up Networking Server are not part of a
default Windows 95 installation, but are installed separately. SLIP and
CSLIP are installed with the Dial-Up Scripting tool included on the
Windows 95 CD-ROM, or as part of the Internet Jumpstart Kit included with
Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95. Dial-Up Networking Server is included only
with Microsoft Plus!.
<P>
To install the Dial-Up Scripting tool, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>In Control Panel, double-click Add/Remove Programs.

<P><LI>On the Windows Setup tab, click Have Disk.

<P><LI>In the Copy Manufacturer's Files From box, type the following line
   and then click OK
<P>
<P><PRE>      &lt;drive&gt;:\admin\apptools\dscript
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;drive&gt; is the CD-ROM drive containing the Windows 95 CD-ROM.

<P><LI>Click OK.

<P><LI>Click "SLIP and Scripting for Dial-Up Networking."

<P><LI>Click Install.
<P>
</OL>If you have Windows 95 on floppy disks and you are interested in obtaining
the Dial-Up Scripting tool, please see the following article in the

</PRE></OL><h3>Dynamic Status Messages (FSA)</h3>
 
<P>
Messages prefixed with "FSA :" report information about the status of the
connection.
<P>
NOTE: The status messages described below use the following conventions
for describing variables that may change in different instances of the
message:

<UL><LI>"xx" is an 8-bit hexadecimal value.
<LI>"xxyy" is a 16-bit hexadecimal value that identifies a protocol.
<LI>"nnnn" is an abbreviated name for protocol xxyy.
<P>
</UL>Adding Control Protocol xxyy (nnnn) to Control Protocol Chain:
<P>
This message indicates that an NCP that is supported by the implementation
of PPP has been selected in the connectoid for this connection.
<P>
Protocol Disabled by User - Skipping Control Protocol xxyy (nnnn):
<P>
This message indicates that a protocol that is supported by the
implementation of PPP has been disabled by the user in the Server Types
dialog box in the Dial-Up Networking connectoid.
<P>
Protocol Not Bound - Skipping Control Protocol xxyy (nnnn):
<P>
This message indicates that a protocol that is supported by the
implementation of PPP is not bound to the Dial-Up Adapter in the Network
tool in Control Panel.
<P>
Encrypted Password Required:
<P>
This message indicates that both peers have the ability to exchange an
encrypted password, and the option is enabled at both ends of the
connection. When applied to Windows 95, this message indicates that the
client has enabled the Require Encrypted Password option in the Server
Types Settings dialog box, and the DUN server has the same option enabled
in its Server Types Settings dialog box. When only one is enabled, the
setting is ignored. It does not affect the outcome of the connection.
<P>
Sending Protocol Reject for Control Protocol xxyy:
<P>
This message is direction-specific. It indicates that the computer on
which the Ppplog.txt file is currently being examined has sent a Protocol-
eject packet for a specific network-layer protocol that the implementation
does not support. The packet contains, among other things, a field that
contains the 16-bit protocol identifier and a field that contains as much
information from the rejected packet as possible up to the session's
Maximum-Receivable Unit (MRU) length.
<P>
Received Protocol Reject for Control Protocol xxyy:
<P>
This message is direction-specific. It indicates that the computer on
which the Ppplog.txt file is currently being examined has received a
Protocol-Reject for an NCP whose use it is attempting to negotiate with
a peer.
<P>
Remote PPP Software Sent Unrecognized Packet of Type xx to CP xxyy!:
<P>
This message follows immediately after the message "Received unknown code
nn" described later in this article. It indicates the packet type
identifier of an unrecognized packet and the control protocol named in the
protocol type field. This usually indicates a faulty physical connection
such as a misconfigured modem, not a malfunctioning implementation of PPP.
<P>
Last Control Protocol Is Up:
<P>
This message indicates that the last control protocol loaded by PPP has
changed to the "Up" state. This does not necessarily mean that the
connection will be successful.
<P>
Last Control Protocol Failed:
<P>
This message indicates that the last control protocol selected for use
with the PPP session has failed to change to the "Up" state. This does not
necessarily mean that the connection will fail.
<P>
No Network Protocols Were Successfully Negotiated:
<P>
This message usually follows the one above. The "Dial-Up Networking could
not negotiate a compatible set of network protocols..." error message
displayed by Dial-Up Networking is generated when this condition exists.
Stepping backward from this message through the Ppplog.txt file will show
you which computer rejected which protocol, and can aid in determining
which computer has a problem.
<P>
<P><h3>Dynamic Status Messages (LCP)</h3>
 
<P>
Messages prefixed with "LCP :" report LCP event information. These events
usually consist of option negotiation status messages or layer transition
notifications.
<P>
NOTE: The status messages described below use the following conventions
for describing variables that may change in different instances of the
message:

<UL><LI>"nn" is a decimal number.
<LI>"xxxx" is a decimal number indicating a quantity in bytes.
<LI>"xxyy" is a 16-bit hexadecimal value that identifies a protocol.
<LI>"nnnn" is a semi-friendly abbreviated name for the same protocol.
<P>
</UL>Received and Accepted ACCM of yyyyy:
<P>
This message indicates that the peers have agreed on an ACCM of yyyyy.
The ACCM is the Asynchronous Control Character Map. It can range in length
from one to four octets. Its function is to provide a method for making
control characters, which could be misinterpreted as actual data,
transparent in the data stream. The default value for the ACCM is
0xffffffff, although 0xa0000 is most commonly seen with Windows 95. If you
want to determine which characters are being mapped into the ACCM, convert
it to binary, and then locate the positions of all bits set to 1. For
example:
<P>
<PRE> ACCM = a0000h or 0000101000000000b

 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

There are some additional steps taken before a control character is
transmitted, but these steps are not included because they are not within
the scope of this article. If you want more information about this
process, please see RFC 1662. This RFC covers the framing style that PPP
uses.
<P>
Received and Accepted Authentication Protocol xxyy (nnnn):
<P>
This message indicates that the configuration option for the
authentication protocol to be used was accepted by both peers. The
Windows 95 implementation of PPP can use one of three authentication
methods: Password Authentication Protocol (PAP), Challenge-Handshake
Authentication Protocol (CHAP), or the Shiva Password Authentication
Protocol (SPAP).
<P>
PAP is the least secure of the three authentication types. It uses a
clear-text transmission of the password from the client to the host. Such
a transmission can be easily intercepted.
<P>
CHAP uses a secure challenge-response authentication method that allows
the peer to be authenticated by an "authenticator" without transmitting
the password in the clear as PAP does. The host sends a "challenge" to the
client that consists of a randomly generated octet stream. Upon receiving
the challenge, the peer concatenates the CHAP session ID, challenge value,
and the user's password and then hashes it. This hash value and the user
name of the peer being authenticated is then sent to the authenticator in
a response. The authenticator maintains a database that correlates user
names to passwords. When it receives the response from the peer, it looks
up the user's password, performs the same concatenation and hashing, and
compares the hash value it generates to the one from the peer. If the
values match, the peer is authentic.
<P>
Hashing is a mathematical operation performed on a given value using a
known algorithm to ensure that it is computationally unfeasible to
reverse-engineer intelligible data from hashed data. The hashing algorithm
most commonly used by CHAP is known as Message-Digest 5 (MD5). RFC 1321
outlines MD5.
<P>
SPAP is used exclusively with the Shiva LAN Rover remote access unit and
when you are dialing into a Windows 95-based computer that is performing
pass-through validation with a Novell NetWare server. It is more secure
than PAP in that it provides encryption of PAP-transmitted passwords and
access attempts to Novell NetWare binderies.
<P>
Received and Accepted Magic Number aabbxxyy:
<P>
A magic number is a hexadecimal value between two and four octets in
length. It is a unique number generated from a random seed value that is
determined from some external source, such as the intervals between the
operator's keystrokes or the Nth decimal measurement of the system clock.
Each peer generates a magic number during LCP negotiation. It is used to
ensure that the PPP session actually involves two peers, in order to
prevent looped-back connections. In Windows 95, if a peer receives a magic
number equal to its own, or one of value 0, it is rejected, and the peers
must re-exchange magic numbers. All diagnostic packets use the magic
number to identify the sender of the packet.
<P>
Naking Possibly Loopback Magic Number:
<P>
When an invalid value for the magic number is received, that configuration
option is returned to the offending peer in a Configure-Nak, prompting the
exchange of a new and hopefully valid magic number. If the condition
cannot be resolved, the link terminates immediately. This error is
extremely rare. If it is received, try the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>In the Dial-Up Networking connectoid, in TCP/IP Settings, set all
   options to "Server Assigned."

<P><LI>In the Network tool in Control Panel, configure the instance of TCP/IP
   bound to the Dial-Up Adapter with the user's TCP/IP information;
   specifically the DNS servers and IP addressing information.

<P><LI>Reboot and try the connection again.
<P>
</OL>If this, coupled with standard troubleshooting procedures, fails to
resolve the issue, have the user contact his or her Internet service
provider or system administrator.
<P>
Received and Accepted Protocol Field Compression Option:
<P>
This message indicates that both peers have agreed to compress the
information contained in the PPP frame's protocol field. This reduces the
size of that field from two octets to one. This configuration option was
designed into PPP with slow or low-bandwidth links in mind.
<P>
Received and Accepted Address+Control Field Compression Option:
<P>
This message indicates that both peers have agreed to compress link-layer
address and control fields within the PPP frame. This option is easily
implemented as the values of these fields are constants in a Point-to-
Point connection. Like the protocol field compression option, this option
was included to improve performance on slow or low-bandwidth links.
<P>
Received Configure Reject for Callback Control Protocol Option:
<P>
This message is direction-specific. It indicates that the computer on
which the Ppplog.txt file is currently being examined has rejected the use
of the callback control protocol. This computer is usually a Dial-Up
Networking server that does not support the callback control protocol. It
is included in the Dial-Up Networking client for use with Microsoft
Windows NT. With Windows 95, this rejection message is a non-catastrophic
event. Other implementations of PPP, for security reasons, may use a
callback feature to augment user authentication and require that the peer
be called back.
<P>
Rejecting Callback Protocol Negotiation Request:
<P>
This message is direction-specific. It indicates that the computer on
which the Ppplog.txt file is currently being examined has rejected an
attempt by the peer to negotiate the use of the callback control protocol.
<P>
Received Unknown Code nn:
<P>
This message indicates that the computer on which the Ppplog.txt file is
currently being examined has received an LCP packet that contains an LCP
packet identifier that the implementation does not support. These packets
are discarded.
<P>
<P><h3>Callback Control Protocol (CallbackCP)</h3>
 
<P>
The CallbackCP is seldom seen in the Ppplog.txt file. The messages shown
in the Ppplog.txt file are described below, and a log example is provided
later in this article.
<P>
CallbackCP : Layer Started:
<P>
This message is shown when the CallbackCP has not been rejected by either
peer, and peer authentication was successful. One of the next three
messages listed will follow this message.
<P>
Callback : Skipping Callback and Continuing with Current Connection:
<P>
This message indicates that the server supports the CallbackCP, and that
the use of the peer callback has been disabled. This is commonly seen when
dialing into a Windows NT RAS server.
<P>
Callback : Telling Server to Callback at User Specified Number:
<P>
When callback is enabled on the server, it can be configured to let the
user supply the phone number to be called back with. When this is the
case, the user will see a dialog box that prompts him or her to enter the
phone number.
<P>
Callback : Telling Server to Callback at Administrator Specified Number:
<P>
When callback is enabled on the server, it can be configured with a preset
number for each user. This is typically used in high-security environments
to guard against the possibility that a user's logon information has been
compromised. The user must be at a prearranged telephone number known to
the server. When this is the case, the user will see a dialog box that
prompts him or her to accept the "&lt;Administrator&gt;" password, at which
point the callback procedure either terminates or continues depending on
the user's selection of OK or Cancel.
<P>
CallbackCP : Layer Finished:
<P>
When the user has either supplied the necessary information or canceled
the connection, this message is displayed. If the connection is going to
be reestablished through a callback, PPP shuts down and enters a wait-for-
call mode. When the server calls back, PPP answers the phone, final link
negotiation takes place, and the connection is established.
<P>
CallbackCP : Layer Up:
<P>
When the peers skip the callback procedure, this message is shown. When
the connection is terminated, the CallbackCP is closed just like any other
protocol. The actual skipping of callback is not considered a catastrophic
event, and as such, the protocol is not closed at that point.
<P>
<P><h3>Values for xxyy and nnnn</h3>
 
<P>
Values for xxyy in the [0xxx-3xxx] range represent the network-layer
protocols of specific datagrams. Values in the [8xxx-bxxx] range identify
NCP datagrams for the associated protocol, if it has one. Not all of the
protocol identifiers listed below are present in the Windows 95
implementation of PPP. This information can be found in greater detail in
RFC 1700. Listings with an asterisk (*) are supported in Windows 95.

<P>
Lines 1-12:
<P>
Lines 1-12 outline the computer's current configuration: which protocols
are bound and enabled, what the server type is, and so on. In a PPP phase
diagram, this section would most closely correspond to the Link-Dead
phase. Lines 5-7 are important as they describe the status of the network
protocols installed. At least one of the three protocols should say
"Adding Control Protocol..." or the connection will fail. In this example,
IP and IPX are disabled in the connectoid used to make the connection;
only NetBEUI will be used.
<P>
However, if lines 5-7 looked like this:
<P>
<PRE> Protocol not bound - skipping control protocol 803f (NBFCP).
 Protocol disabled by user - skipping control protocol 8021 (IPCP).
 Protocol disabled by user - skipping control protocol 802b (IPXCP).

</PRE>The connection would fail with a "Dial-Up Networking could not
negotiate..." error message. If this is the problem, determine which
protocol is common to both computers, then make sure that it is loaded and
bound to the Dial-Up Adapter on both computers.
<P>
Lines 13-21:
<P>
Lines 13-21 show the Link Control Protocol (LCP) negotiating the
operational parameters for link-layer control of the connection,
illustrating the Link Establishment phase.
<P>
In this example, the process is completed the first time through.
Depending on peer configuration, option negotiation can be repeated
several times, until both sides agree on the options and their values.
This process must finish. If it does not, the connection is terminated
immediately.
<P>
When there is a hardware problem related to the modem or serial cable, or
if the phone line is unreliable, it is common for this portion of the
Ppplog.txt file to resemble the following:
<P>
<PRE> Callback negotiation enabled.
 Layer started.
 Layer finished.

</PRE>This is significant because the Ppplog.txt file does not list what
Pppmac.vxd cannot make sense of. If one peer sends a frame that contains
a valid Configure-Request packet, and it is damaged in transit, the
receiving peer cannot identify it and it will be discarded as outlined in
RFC 1661. If, within a certain amount of time, LCP configuration does not
finish, the Finite State Automaton (FSA) will time out. As a consequence,
the connection will be terminated. Typically, between 5-10 seconds elapse
during a high-speed connection after carrier negotiation finishes before
the connection is terminated due to LCP option negotiation failure. If you
see this message sequence in a Ppplog.txt file, consider the following
items:

<OL><P><LI>The modem, cable, or serial port is bad.

<P><LI>Enable the Post-Dial Terminal window to verify that there are no menus
   to navigate or additional information required from the user after
   connection to start the PPP connection.

<P><LI>You may be using the wrong line protocol type (PPP instead of SLIP, and
   so on).
<P>
</OL>Lines 22-24:
<P>
Lines 22-24 log the actions taken during the Authentication phase of the
PPP connection. If peer authentication fails, the connection must
terminate immediately. Lines 22-24 document this process. Normally, this
portion of the Ppplog.txt will be only three lines long. However,
depending on the type of authentication taking place, this section can be
much longer. When PAP is used for peer authentication, the number of
password retries can be infinite, unless there is a mechanism in place to
limit the number of tries.
<P>
Lines 25-32:
<P>
If user authentication finishes, the next step is to configure the
negotiated network protocols for use. This is the Network Layer
Configuration phase, and it continues until the operational parameters
for all protocols common to both peers have been negotiated. If this is
successful, the following message will be displayed:
<P>
<PRE> FSA : Last control protocol is up.

</PRE></OL>If network layer configuration is unsuccessful, the following message will
be displayed:
<P>
<PRE> FSA : No network protocols were successfully negotiated.

</PRE>This will be accompanied by the "Dial-Up Networking could not
negotiate..." error message in the user interface, and the connection
will be terminated.
<P>
Lines 33-51:
<P>
When either peer, whether by user or administrative (automaton) action,
decides to end the PPP session, the connection transitions to the Link
Termination phase. This is initiated when one peer transmits a Terminate-
Request packet. When all upper-level protocols have been closed, the peer
transmits a Terminate-Ack and the connection then closes completely.
<P>
For the most part, this section lists the session statistics, such as
frames transmitted, CRC errors, and so on. This information can be useful
when troubleshooting. For example, if you are being spontaneously
disconnected, and you have an unusually high number of CRC errors (with a
good modem, 1-2 are allowable), you might want to have your telephone
lines checked for excessive noise. The telephone line is not the world's
friendliest transmission medium, and while the quality of telephone
connections is generally excellent, in some areas, and during certain
weather conditions, the line quality can be very poor. When the modems
cannot maintain a reliable connection, they disconnect. With external
modems, a poorly made serial cable can also be a problem. A high-quality,
well-shielded cable is desirable for the best performance with an external
modem.

These lines document the procedure by which the client is assigned an IP
address by the ISP. Initially, the client's IP address is 0, as shown by
line 3. IP addresses are assigned to the client by the host. The host can
also assign the client primary and secondary nameserver (DNS and WINS)
addresses. To determine if your ISP will assign DNS addresses in the event
that you do not specify them, you can do one of two things:

<OL><P><LI>Call your IPS and ask.

<P><LI>Set your connectoid to "Server assigned name server addresses" and use
   Winipcfg.exe to see if the server has assigned DNS addresses.
<P>
</OL>In line 6, the client changes its IP address from 0 to C7-AE-F6-48. If the
IP addresses look strange, it is because in the Ppplog.txt file, IP
addresses are shown in hexadecimal format. The decimal equivalents of IP
addresses are used when configuring network connections that use TCP/IP
because they are easy to handle. The actual information is transmitted in
binary, which would be difficult to remember because the addresses total
32 binary digits. For example:
<P>
<PRE> Binary:  11000111 10101110 11110110 01001000
 Hex:     C7-AE-F6-48

</PRE></OL>Lines 9-13:
<P>
With line 9, the connection has stabilized and interaction with the
Internet is possible. Line 10 indicates that an administrative action
(the user or the host) has caused the connection to begin closing. The
remaining lines chronicle the status transitions of the LCP and IPCP
modules. With line 13, the connection has been completely terminated, and
all parameters negotiated during the connection have been flushed from
the TCP/IP stack.

<P>
Lines 22-24 show the IPX Control Protocol (IPXCP) receiving and setting
its IPX network and node numbers, then opening. At this point, IPX/SPX is
configured and functioning.
<P>
Lines 25-27 and 32-34 show the configuration of the TCP/IP protocol,
handled by the Internet Protocol Configuration protocol (IPCP). The RAS
server used for this example supports DHCP, which handles the assignment
of WINS and node IP addresses. With line 34, TCP/IP is configured and
functioning.
<P>
Lines 29-31 document the failure of the NetBIOS Frames Control protocol to
be properly configured. Line 29 lists the actual cause for failure:
<P>
<PRE> NBFCP : NAK received - Projection failed.

</PRE>This means that the client broadcast a packet to the remote network in an
attempt to see if its network name was unique, and a computer responded as
having the same name. Because NetBIOS is completely dependent on its
NetBIOS name, a duplicate name on the same network cannot be tolerated.
Therefore, the protocol closes immediately. Line 35 indicates that all NCP
activity has completed and the link is ready to pass network-layer traffic.
<P>
Lines 36-45:
<P>
Line 36 indicates that the connection has been terminated, and from this
point on, all the NCPs shut down, ending with the LCP entering the
Finished state at line 44. PPP has come full-circle to the Link-Dead phase.
<P>
NOTE: Between lines 36 and 37, the link statistics are usually displayed.
They have been removed for this example.

Nearly all messages have been removed from the example below. This example
is provided to illustrate the flow of a Windows 95 DUN connection to a
server that supports the CallbackCP option. In this particular connection,
the user was allowed to specify the phone number.

Lines 7-11:
<P>
These lines are the most critical part of the connection. If there are any
errors here, the callback will fail. There are currently no examples of
this failing due to an error in the implementation of PPP.
<P>
The most common cause for failure is a modem that is physically set using
DIP switches or jumpers to the S0=0 condition (auto-answer disabled). In
some cases, the switch setting will override any command issued to set the
modem to answer after 'n' number of rings (ATS0=n). The next most common
cause for failure is PCMCIA modems connected to a telephone network
(either the PSTN or a PBX-type environment) that is not supplying enough
ring voltage to trip the modem's ring-detect circuit. Unfortunately, in
this case, there is nothing that can be done.
<P>
Either way, the best way to test this condition is to use a terminal
program such as HyperTerminal to issue the ATS0=2 command to the modem,
and dial the line the modem is connected to. If the modem does not answer
the line, the modem has a hardware-related problem as described above. If
it does, you may want to add the S0 command to the modem's initialization
string.
<P>
Line 15:
<P>
This is the point where DUN enters the wait-for-call state. When the
server calls back, the log is opened again.
<P>
The one thing to remember is that network-layer protocols do not go
through option negotiation until the callback has finished. Just because
the peers agree to the callback does not mean that the protocol
configuration is correct. If the callback works, and protocol negotiation
fails, continue to troubleshoot the issue normally.
