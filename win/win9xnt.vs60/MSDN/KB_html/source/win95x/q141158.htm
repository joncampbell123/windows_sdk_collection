The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you place a Wrkgrp.ini file in a shared Windows folder to specify a
list of workgroups that users can join, the contents of the Wrkgrp.ini file
may not be implemented.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Shared Installations</h3>
 
<P>
When you are using a shared installation of Windows 95, the contents of the
Wrkgrp.ini file are implemented only if the file is located in the System
folder in the shared Windows folder on the network server. If the
Wrkgrp.ini file is placed in the shared Windows folder, the contents of the
file are not implemented.
<P>
<P><h3>Stand-Alone Installations</h3>
 
<P>
When you install Windows 95 from a shared Windows folder on a network
server, but choose not to use a shared installation of Windows 95, the
contents of the Wrkgrp.ini file are implemented only if the file is located
in the Windows\System folder on your local hard disk. If the Wrkgrp.ini
file is placed in the shared Windows folder on the network server, it is
copied to your Windows folder when you install Windows 95 from the network
server, not your Windows\System folder.
<P>
If you place the Wrkgrp.ini file in the System folder in the shared Windows
folder on the network server, the file is not copied to your Windows\System
folder when you install Windows 95 from the network server. Therefore, this
problem occurs with stand-alone installations of Windows 95 even if the
Wrkgrp.ini file is placed in the System folder in the shared Windows folder
on the network server.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Shared Installations</h3>
 
<P>
If you are using a shared installation of Windows 95, you can work around
this problem by copying the Wrkgrp.ini file to the System folder in the
shared Windows folder on the network server.
<P>
<P><h3>Stand-Alone Installations</h3>
 
<P>
If you installed Windows 95 from a shared Windows folder on a network
server, but chose not to use a shared installation of Windows, you can work
around this problem by copying the Wrkgrp.ini file to the Windows\System
folder on your local hard disk.
<P>
To prevent this problem from occurring with future stand-alone
installations of Windows 95, you can modify the Msbatch.inf file so that
the Wrkgrp.ini file is copied to the Windows\System folder on local hard
disks. To do so, add the following lines to the Msbatch.inf file:
<P>
<PRE>   [Install]
   CopyFiles=wrkgrp.ini.copy

   [wrkgrp.ini.copy]
   wrkgrp.ini

   [DestinationDirs]
   wrkgrp.ini.copy=11

</PRE>Also, make sure that the following lines are present in the Msbatch.inf
file:
<P>
<PRE>   [Version]
   LayoutFile=Layout.inf

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
After you create a shared Windows folder on a network server from which
users can install Windows 95, users can create their own shared
installation or stand-alone installation of Windows 95. When a shared
installation of Windows 95 is used, each user has a separate folder that
contains the specific configuration information for his or her computer.
The remainder of the Windows files are found in the shared Windows folder
on the network server.
<P>
When a stand-alone installation of Windows 95 is used, all the Windows
files are copied to the user's local hard disk. Even though Windows is
installed from the network server, Windows does not need any files from the
network server to run.
