<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After you use Microsoft Backup to restore files, you may receive the
following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Errors occurred during this operation. Do you want to
   view them now?

</PRE>Clicking Yes displays the error.log file, which contains the following
errors:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Backup has encountered an unexpected error
   number. Quit and restart Backup, and then try again.

<LI>Microsoft Backup cannot find this file. If this is a
   network file, the network may not be available. Or, the
   file Backup is looking for may have been deleted or
   moved.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior can occur if the files are being restored to a path that
includes a logical drive letter that does not exist on the computer.
<P>
For example, this behavior can occur if files are backed up from drive E
on one computer and then restored on a different computer that does not
have a logical drive E. By default, Backup attempts to restore files to
the original location. Because the drive is not present, Backup is unable
to restore the files.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To enable Backup to restore files to an alternate location, follow these
steps:

<OL><P><LI>In Backup, click Options on the Settings menu.

<P><LI>Click the Restore tab.

<P><LI>Click Alternate Location.

<P><LI>Click OK.

<P><LI>Try to restore the files again.
<P></OL>
