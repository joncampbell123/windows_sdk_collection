The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you start Microsoft Exchange, or click the Inbox button on the
Microsoft Exchange toolbar, you may receive the following error
message:
<P>
<PRE>   The command you specified could not be carried out.  A default set of
   folders could not be found. Your active profile must include such a set,
   such as a personal folder file.

</PRE>When you click OK, Microsoft Exchange seems to work properly.
However, when you open a message in the Inbox folder, or try to
compose a new message, you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   The item could not be displayed. A default set of folders could not be
   found. Your active profile must include such a set, such as a personal
   folder file.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The errors described above can occur when any of the following
conditions exists:

<UL><LI>You do not have a set of personal folders or a personal information
   store in your active profile.

<LI>You do have a set of personal folders or a personal information store
   in your active profile, but the "Deliver new mail to the following
   location" field is set to None.

<LI>You have removed the default message store, leaving only the secondary
   message store (such as personal folders or another personal information
   store) in your active profile.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve the problem, use the appropriate method. Note that all of
the methods involve configuring your active profile in Microsoft
Exchange.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1: No Personal Folders or Personal Information Store</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Options.

<P><LI>On the Services tab, click Add.

<P><LI>Click Personal Folders, and then click OK.

<P><LI>In the File Name box, click the appropriate .pst file, and then click
   Open. (The file is usually named Mailbox.pst and is located in the
   Exchange folder.)

<P><LI>If the .pst file is password-protected, type the password and then
   click OK.

<P><LI>In the Personal Folders dialog box, click OK.

<P><LI>In the properties for the active profile, click OK.
<P>
</OL><h3>Method 2: "Deliver New Mail to..." Field Set to None</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Options.

<P><LI>Click the Deliver tab.

<P><LI>In the "Deliver new mail to the following location" box, click either
   Personal Folders or Personal Information Store.

<P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
</OL><h3>Method 3: Removed Default Message Store</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Options.

<P><LI>On the Services tab, click Add.

<P><LI>Click Personal Folders, and then click OK.

<P><LI>Click the Appropriate .pst file, and then click Open.
<P>
   NOTE: There may be more than one .pst file. You should click the
   default message store, which is usually called Mailbox.pst and is
   located in the Exchange folder.

<P><LI>If the .pst file is password-protected, type the password and then
   click OK.

<P><LI>In the Personal Folders dialog box, click OK.

<P><LI>In the properties for the active profile, click OK.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
"Personal information store" and "My information" are interchangeable
terms. They both contain Inbox, Outbox, Deleted Items, and Sent
folders. These folders are necessary for a correct default message
store. The default message store is literally the first information
store added to a profile. Personal folders is designed as a secondary
message store and contains only a Deleted Items folder.
