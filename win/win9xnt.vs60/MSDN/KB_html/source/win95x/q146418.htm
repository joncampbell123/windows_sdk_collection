The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you start a program and then quit it, the Free System Resources value
may not return to the same value as before you started the program.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
There are two possible explanations for this behavior:

<UL><LI>System Initialization
<P>
   Windows 95 defers much of system initialization until the first time
   a program asks for a particular service. For example, each font is
   initialized when a program first asks for it, rather than initializing
   all fonts at system startup (as in Windows 3.1).
<P>
   If a program requests a service that uses deferred initialization, the
   service remains initialized after the program has exited. The system
   resources associated with that service are not freed. The system keeps
   the service initialized so that the next program that requests the
   service does not have to wait for the service to be initialized.
<P>
   This behavior is by design.

<LI>Compatibility
<P>
   For compatibility reasons, Windows 95 does not free system resources
   abandoned by Windows 3.1-based programs until all Windows 3.1-based
   programs have been closed. Only when there are no Windows 3.1-based
   programs running can Windows 95 safely release abandoned system
   resources.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 

<UL><LI>System Initialization
<P>
   The system is operating normally.

<LI>Compatibility
<P>
   Quit all Windows 3.1-based programs to allow Windows 95 to perform
   maximum system resource reclamation.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
