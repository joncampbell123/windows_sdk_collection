WINDOWS
kbenv kbhw
<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you restart your computer in MS-DOS mode or boot to a Windows 95
command prompt from the hard disk or a bootable floppy disk, you may be
unable to access the CD-ROM drive. This behavior may occur even though you
are able to access the CD-ROM drive from the Windows 95 graphical user
interface.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior can occur if the real-mode CD-ROM driver and real-mode
Microsoft CD-ROM Extensions driver, Mscdex.exe, (or a third-party
equivalent) are not being loaded in the Config.sys and Autoexec.bat files
that are used when you restart the computer in MS-DOS mode or boot to a
Windows 95 command prompt.
<P>
To access a CD-ROM drive when you boot to a Windows 95 command prompt or
restart the computer in MS-DOS mode, you must load the real-mode CD-ROM
driver in the Config.sys file and the MSCDEX driver in the Autoexec.bat or
Dosstart.bat file. If your CD-ROM drive is supported in protected mode in
Windows 95, the real-mode CD-ROM and MSCDEX drivers are most likely not
being loaded in the Config.sys and Autoexec.bat or Dosstart.bat files on
the hard disk. In addition, if you boot from a floppy disk, the CD-ROM and
MSCDEX drivers will not load unless you manually configure the Config.sys
and Autoexec.bat files on the floppy disk to load them.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Make sure that the Config.sys and Autoexec.bat or Dosstart.bat files you
use when you restart the computer in MS-DOS mode or when you boot to a
Windows 95 command prompt load the necessary real-mode drivers for the
CD-ROM drive. Be sure to use the Mscdex.exe file in the Windows\Command
folder.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Windows 95 does not include real-mode CD-ROM drivers. If you need access
to the CD-ROM drive when you boot to a Windows 95 command prompt or when
you restart the computer in MS-DOS mode, you must use the real-mode CD-ROM
driver included with the CD-ROM drive. For information about how to
obtain, install, or configure the real-mode CD-ROM driver, consult the
documentation included with the drive, or contact the drive's manufacturer.
<P>
Windows 95 does include an MSCDEX driver that is located in the
Windows\Command folder. If you must use a real-mode MSCDEX driver, you
should use the driver in the Windows\Command folder instead of the driver
included with the CD-ROM drive.
<P>
The real-mode CD-ROM and MSCDEX drivers can be loaded from several
different locations, depending on the reason they are being loaded. If you
are loading the real-mode drivers because you need access to the CD-ROM
drive when you boot to a Windows 95 command prompt, the drivers must be
loaded from the Config.sys and Autoexec.bat files in the root folder of
the boot drive. If you are booting to a Windows 95 command prompt from a
floppy disk instead of a hard disk, the drivers must be loaded from the
Config.sys and Autoexec.bat files on the floppy disk.
<P>
If you are loading the real-mode drivers because you are restarting the
computer in MS-DOS mode, the drivers can be loaded from either of the
following locations:

<UL><LI>The Config.sys and Autoexec.bat files in the root folder of the boot
   drive.

<LI>The custom Config.sys and Autoexec.bat files that you specify in the
   properties for the program you are running in MS-DOS mode, the
   properties for a shortcut that starts the program you are running in
   MS-DOS mode, or the properties for the "Exit to Dos.pif" file that is
   used to start Windows 95 in MS-DOS mode.
<P>
</UL>If you are restarting the computer in MS-DOS mode, you can also load
MSCDEX from the Dosstart.bat file in the Windows folder. This file is used
when you restart the computer in MS-DOS mode, but it is not used when you
boot to a Windows 95 command prompt or start Windows 95 normally. If this
file does not already exist in the Windows folder, you must create the
file manually.
<P>
NOTE: When you install Windows 95, Setup disables (remarks out) the
existing Mscdex.exe line in the Autoexec.bat file if it detects a CD-ROM
drive for which Windows 95 includes a protected-mode driver. Therefore,
when you boot to a command prompt or restart the computer in MS-DOS mode,
MSCDEX is not available. To make MSCDEX available, enable the existing
Mscdex.exe line in the Autoexec.bat file. You may also need to modify the
line so that it loads the MSCDEX driver from the Windows\Command folder
instead of the driver included with the CD-ROM drive.
