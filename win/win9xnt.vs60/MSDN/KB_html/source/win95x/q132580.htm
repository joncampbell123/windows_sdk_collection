The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After you install Close-Up, you receive the following error message when
you start Windows 95:
<P>
<PRE>   Cannot find a device file that may be needed to run Windows. Make sure
   that the path...

</PRE>The file that cannot be found is Vddvga.vxd.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Close-Up must change the video driver in order to support desktop display
on a remote computer. However, Close-Up does not modify the Windows system
files directly. Instead, it installs a terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR)
program that watches for an application trying to read the System.ini file
(as Windows 95 does at startup). When Windows 95 reaches the display driver
line in the System.ini file, the TSR steps in and patches the read
operation on the fly. However, the file that the patch references
(Vddvga.vxd) is not part of Windows 95.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Since no changes were made to the system files there is no workaround.
Windows 95 is not a supported platform for the Host side of Close-Up, but
does work as a Guest workstation. Norton-Lambert plans to release a version
of Close-Up that is compatible with Windows 95.
