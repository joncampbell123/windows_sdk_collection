The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
<LI>Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you try to use ScanDisk to check a drive that was compressed with
DriveSpace 3 for errors, you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   This drive was compressed by a program that is not supported by
   ScanDisk. As a result, ScanDisk is unable to detect and repair
   compression-related errors.

</PRE>If you click OK, ScanDisk checks the drive. This problem can occur even if
the drive you want to check was compressed by a program that is supported
by ScanDisk.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem can occur if the Dskmaint.dll file in the Windows\System
folder is the version of the file included with Windows 95, not the
version included with Microsoft Plus!.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Replace the Dskmaint.dll file in the Windows\System folder with the
version of the file included with Microsoft Plus!. To do so, follow
these steps:

<OL><P><LI>If ScanDisk is running, close it.

<P><LI>Type the following line at a command prompt, and then press ENTER:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ren c:\windows\system\dskmaint.dll dskmaint.xxx
</PRE>
<P><LI>Extract the Dskmaint.dll file from the Plus_2.cab cabinet file
   on the Microsoft Plus! CD-ROM or from disk 2 of the original
   Microsoft Plus! disks to the Windows\System folder.
<P>
   For information about using the Extract tool, type "extract"
   (without quotation marks) at a command prompt, or see the following
   article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
