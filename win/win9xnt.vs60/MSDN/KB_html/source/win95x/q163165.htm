The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, you should first make a backup copy of the
registry files (System.dat and User.dat). Both are hidden files in the
Windows folder.
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the TCP/IP protocol with a server-based installation of
Windows 95, 32-bit programs may be unable to resolve TCP/IP names using a
DNS server. In some circumstances, it may be possible to resolve NetBIOS
names or host names on the local DNS domain, but it may not be possible to
resolve fully qualified domain names (such as "yourhost.yourdomain.dom").
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Windows 95 may not be able locate the Wsock32.dll file when installed as
a server-based installation. If this file is not found in the expected
location, or if more than one copy of this file is found in the search
path, DNS name resolution does not succeed.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall Windows 95. Microsoft cannot guarantee
that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be
solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
NOTE: For information about how to edit the registry, view the Changing
Keys And Values online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Note
that you should make a backup copy of the registry files (System.dat and
User.dat) before you edit the registry.
<P>
To work around this problem, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Create a System folder in the workstation's Windows folder, and then
   copy the Wsock32.dll file to the System folder. Repeat this step for
   each computer running a shared copy of Windows 95 on the network.

<P><LI>Add an entry for the System folder (from step 1) to the PATH statement
   in the Autoexec.bat file.

<P><LI>Rename or delete the Wsock32.dll file in the shared System folder, and
   in every other folder listed in the PATH statement. (You may want to
   remove unnecessary entries from the PATH statement.)

<P><LI>Make sure the following registry values point to the Wsock32.dll file
   in the System folder created in step 1:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Hkey_Local_Machine\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\VxD\Mstcp\
<PRE></PRE>         Parameters\Winsock\HelperDllName

      Hkey_Local_Machine\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\VxD\Mstcp\
         ServiceProvider\ProviderPath

</PRE></OL><h2>STATUS</h2>

in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
