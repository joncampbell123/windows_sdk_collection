The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The toll prefix list contains a list of local number that have the same
area code as the location from which you are dialing, but that require
you to dial the area code. You can modify the toll prefix list that is
used for a particular dialing location.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To modify the toll prefix list for a dialing location, follow these
steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Programs, point to Accessories,
   and then click Phone Dialer.
<P>
   NOTE: If Phone Dialer is not installed, you can install it from
   the Windows Setup tab in the Add/Remove Programs tool in Control
   Panel.

<P><LI>In the Number To Dial box, type a 7-digit phone number with the same
   first three digits as the phone number you want to add to the toll
   prefix list. For example, if you want to add all numbers beginning
   with 555 to the toll prefix list, type a number that begins with 555.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Dialing Properties.

<P><LI>In the I Am Dialing From box, click the dialing location whose toll
   prefix list you want to modify.

<P><LI>Click the Dial As Long Distance Call check box to select it, and then
   click OK.
<P>
</OL>When you perform this procedure, the entry for the dialing location you
select is modified in the Telephon.ini file. The [Locations] section of
the Telephon.ini file contains an entry for each dialing location you
have created. The entry for the default dialing location is similar to:
<P>
<PRE>   Location0=0,"Default Location","9","9","425",1,0,0,1,"",0,""

</PRE></OL>If you add numbers that start with 555 and 666 to the toll prefix list
for the default dialing location, the entry in the Telephon.ini file
appears similar to:
<P>
<PRE>   Location0=0,"Default Location","9","9","425",1,0,0,1,"555,666",0,""

</PRE>The prefixes are separated by commas, with no preceding or trailing
spaces.
