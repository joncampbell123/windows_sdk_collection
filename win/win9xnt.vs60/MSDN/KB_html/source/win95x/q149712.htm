<P><h3>Before Purchasing Windows 95</h3>
 
<P>
Before you purchase Windows 95, decide whether you are going to purchase
the CD-ROM version of Windows 95 or the floppy disk version of Windows 95.
If you have a CD-ROM drive installed in your computer, you should purchase
the CD-ROM version of Windows 95. The CD-ROM version is preferred for the
following reasons:

<UL><LI>Installing from a CD-ROM is typically much faster than installing from
   floppy disks. In addition, installing from a CD-ROM is more convenient
   because you do not need to swap disks.

<LI>The CD-ROM version of Windows 95 includes additional files that are not
   included with the floppy disk version. These files include additional
   accessories such as an Online User's Guide and Windows 95 Tour,
   administrative tools, wallpaper, and other miscellaneous tools.

<LI>CD-ROMs are more reliable than floppy disks. It is less likely that a
   Windows 95 CD-ROM will become damaged or infected with a virus.
<P>
</UL>Before you purchase the CD-ROM or floppy disk version of Windows 95, you
should also make sure that your computer meets the minimum hardware
requirements for running Windows 95. These requirements include a 386DX or
better processor, 4 megabytes (MB) of memory, one CD-ROM drive or 3.5-inch
high-density floppy disk drive, and a display adapter and monitor that
support VGA or higher resolution. For additional information about the
installation requirements for Windows 95, please see the following article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : Windows 95 Installation Requirements

</PRE>If you are not sure if your computer meets the minimum hardware
requirements for running Windows 95, obtain the Windows 95 System Check
tool. Windows 95 System Check is a tool that performs a basic test of your
computer's hardware and software to ensure compatibility with Windows 95.
<P>
Windows 95 System Check is not intended as a comprehensive diagnostics
tool to check for every known Windows 95 incompatibility. Instead, this
tool is designed to answer some common questions you might have before you
upgrade to Windows 95. For information about obtaining Windows 95 System
Check, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

</PRE><h3>Before Installing Windows 95</h3>
 
<P>
Before you upgrade your existing version of Windows or Windows for
Workgroups to Windows 95, you should perform the following steps:

<UL><LI>Make sure that your computer is not infected with a virus. To do so,
   run an anti-virus program with the latest virus signatures and allow
   the program to remove any viruses that it finds.

<LI>Close any programs that run automatically, including anti-virus
   programs, screen savers, and third-party memory managers and shells.

<LI>Back up all critical data on your hard disk. While it is unlikely that
   you will encounter a serious problem installing Windows 95, it is
   always a good idea to perform a complete system backup before install-
   ing a new operating system. When you upgrade your computer's operating
   system, it is possible that an error could occur (such as a problem due
   to incompatible hardware or a power failure) that could temporarily or
   permanently prevent access to the data on your hard disk.

<LI>Make sure that any network software installed on your computer is
   functioning properly. The settings from your existing network
   configuration may not be successfully transferred to Windows 95 if the
   network software is not functioning properly.
<P>
</UL><h3>Installing Windows 95</h3>
 
<P>
After performing the steps in the previous section, install Windows 95 on
your computer by following these steps:

   disk drive containing Windows 95 disk 1.

<P>
</OL>If you are installing Windows 95 from a command prompt, follow these

   disk 1, type the following line, and then press ENTER:
<P>
<P><PRE>      setup
</PRE><P>
</OL>NOTE: If you are upgrading Windows or Windows for Workgroups version 3.1
or later, you should run Setup from your existing installation of Windows
or Windows for Workgroups. If you are upgrading Windows version 3.0, you
must run Setup from a command prompt.
