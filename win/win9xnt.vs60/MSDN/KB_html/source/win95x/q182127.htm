The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When your computer restarts for the first time after you install Windows
95, your computer may seem to stop responding (hang).
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This issue can occur if your computer has a VoiceView modem installed.
The files needed to install this modem may cause multiple instances of
the Grpconv.exe program to start, which may make your computer appear to
hang.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this issue, use the appropriate method:
<P>
<P><h3>Allow Setup to Finish</h3>
 
<P>
Although your computer may seem to be hung, it is not, and you should
allow Setup to continue until it is finished. Note that you may experience
a longer than normal installation time.
<P>
<P><h3>Edit the Mdmvv.inf File</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft does not encourage or support changes to .inf files; therefore,
Microsoft Technical Support does not support the procedure in this
article. Although we have tested the following procedure and it appears
to function as described, make a backup copy of your .inf file before you
proceed.
<P>
If you are a System Administrator who wants to run an unattended Setup,
you can edit the Mdmvv.inf file, and then run Setup again. To do so, use
the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Right-click the Mdmvv.inf file, and then click Open.

<P><LI>In the [VoiceView_Modem] section, place a semi-colon in front of the
   following line:
<P>
<P><PRE>      HKR,, Runonce,,"grpconv /o" line.
</PRE>
<P><LI>On the File menu, click Save, quit the program you used to edit the
   Mdmvv.inf file, and then run Setup again.
<P></OL>
