<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article contains questions and answers about Microsoft Plus! for
Windows 95.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 

<OL><P><LI> Q. I enabled the Smooth Edges Of Screen Fonts feature, but I do not
<P><PRE>       see any difference. What does this feature do and how can I tell if
       I am using it?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. This feature fills the jagged edges of fonts with pixels of an
       intermediate color to make the edges look smoother. You need a
       Windows 95 video driver using more than 256 colors to use this
       feature.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       To see if the feature is working, type some large text in Paint and
       save it. Do this again with the Smooth Edges Of Screen Fonts option
       turned off. Open both files and position them so you can see both.
       On the View menu, point to Zoom, then click Large Size. Compare the
       two documents.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. I enabled the Show Windows Contents While Dragging feature, but it
<P><PRE>       does not work for all programs. Why?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. Many programs simulate window dragging by drawing a ghost rectangle
       and then moving the window when the mouse button is released. These
       programs bypass the code that implements the Show Windows Contents
       While Dragging feature and continue to function as they were
       originally written.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. I installed animated icons, but they are black and white and do not
<P><PRE>       work. Why?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. The following requirements must be met for animated icons to work
       correctly:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>        - You must be using protected-mode disk drivers.

        - You must be using a Windows 95 video driver that meets certain
          criteria. Not all Windows 95 video drivers support animated
          icons.

       For additional information, please see the following article in the
       Microsoft Knowledge Base:

          ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../win95x/q123334.htm">Q123334</A></B>
          TITLE     : Requirements for Animated Cursors

</PRE><P><LI> Q. My Microsoft Plus! screen saver does not display the entire screen.
<P><PRE>       I enabled the "Stretch desktop wallpaper to fit the screen" feature
       but it does not help. What is wrong?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. Nothing is wrong. The amount of detail displayed depends on the
       video resolution you are using. For example, if you are using a
       640 x 480 resolution, less of the screen is displayed than if you
       use a 1024 x 768 resolution. To determine which resolution you are
       using, follow these steps:
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       1. Use the right mouse button to click the desktop, then click
<PRE></PRE>          Properties on the menu that appears.

       2. Click the Settings tab.

       3. Check the Desktop Setting area.

</PRE><P><LI> Q. When I upgraded my hard disk to DriveSpace 3, the amount of space
<P><PRE>       used on my compressed drive increased. Why?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. Microsoft Plus! supports storing up to two gigabytes (GB) of data
       on a compressed drive. Earlier versions of DriveSpace and
       DoubleSpace support storing only 512 megabytes (MB). To accomplish
       this increase in capacity, the compressed drive's reported cluster
       size has been increased from 8K to 32K.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       The smallest file allocation table (FAT) unit is one cluster. On a
       typical hard disk (between 250 and 500 MB), the cluster size is 8K.
       On such a drive, a 1-byte file uses a single cluster, leaving 7999
       bytes unused. This unused space is called slack space. Moving a
       1-byte file from a drive with 8K clusters to a drive with 32K
       clusters results in greater slack space and greater reported used
       disk space. To maintain compatibility, DriveSpace 3 drives must
       report the increased slack space.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. I compressed my hard disk with DriveSpace 3 and now my MS-DOS-based
<P><PRE>       programs do not have enough memory to run in MS-DOS mode. How can I
       get enough memory to run these programs?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. To support the enhanced compression capabilities in Microsoft
       Plus!, the compression driver uses more conventional memory.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       Microsoft Plus! includes a wizard to help you create a boot disk
       that does not load the real-mode compression driver. To start this
       wizard, run the Nocomp.exe tool from the Program Files\Plus!\System
       folder.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. There is a folder on my hard disk called ~MSSETUP.T. Do I need to
<P><PRE>       keep this folder?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. This folder is used while you are setting up Microsoft Plus!. It is
       not needed after Setup is finished so you can remove it.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. I ran the Internet Setup Wizard and now I no longer have a local
<P><PRE>       telephone number to access The Microsoft Network. Why?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. The Microsoft Network uses two sets of telephone access numbers.
       One set provides access to The Microsoft Network, while the other
       set provides access to the Internet and to The Microsoft Network.
       If you have only one access number, your area may not have a number
       for accessing the Internet and The Microsoft Network.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. Why can I not save the password for my Internet service provider
<P><PRE>       after I install Microsoft Plus!?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. You cannot save your password if the password cache feature is not
       enabled.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       For more information, please see the following article in the
       Microsoft Knowledge Base:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>          ARTICLE-ID:  <B><A href="../win95x/q137361.htm">Q137361</A></B>
          TITLE     :  Save Password Check Box is Unavailable

10. Q. The Internet Setup Wizard replaced the DNS configuration settings
       on my computer. Why?

    A. Windows 95 supports only three DNS entries, so the Internet Setup
       Wizard replaces existing entries as necessary.
