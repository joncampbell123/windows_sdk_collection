<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you are running an MS-DOS-based application from an icon in Windows
95, the MS-DOS window remains open with the text "Finished - &lt;Application
Name&gt;" appearing on the title bar after the application has finished
executing.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The MS-DOS window remains open so that you can see any messages, such as
errors, that may be generated by the MS-DOS-based application. This window
appears for any MS-DOS-based application that generates output.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
You can change the program properties for the MS-DOS-based application so
that it closes on exit. To do this:

<OL><P><LI>Use the right (secondary) mouse button to click the icon for the
   MS-DOS-based application.

<P><LI>Click Properties.

<P><LI>Click the Program tab.

<P><LI>Click Close On Exit to select that option.

<P><LI>Click OK to accept the settings.
<P>
</OL>The MS-DOS-based application window should now close after the application
has finished executing. You must change this setting for each MS-DOS-based
application individually--there is no way to set this option globally.
<P>
Note, however, that you can set this option globally for all MS-DOS-based
programs that do not already have their own PIF (program information
file). To do this, create a default PIF with the setting listed above. For
information about creating a default PIF, please see the following article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : How to Create Default PIF for MS-DOS-Based Programs

</PRE></OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If you are running a batch file, you can close the MS-DOS window by adding
the following lines to the end of the batch file:
<P>
<PRE>   echo off
   cls
