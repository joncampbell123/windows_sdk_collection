<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use an ATI Mach 64 ISA display adapter in a Dell DE-series
computer in which the onboard VGA adapter has been disabled through the
CMOS (not by using the jumper), the computer may stop responding (hang)
during Windows 95 Setup, or during detection if the ATI adapter is
installed after Windows 95 is installed.
<P>
This problem can also occur with a Dell Omniplex PCI-series computer. You
can correct this problem on these computers by upgrading the BIOS to
revision A10.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Windows 95 detection searches the ROM area of the computer's memory.
The ATI Mach 64 adapter uses the BFC00 address. During detection, Windows
95 receives information from the onboard display adapter, causing Windows
95 to hang.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Dell Computer Corporation is aware of this situation and is researching the
problem. We will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
as it becomes available.
