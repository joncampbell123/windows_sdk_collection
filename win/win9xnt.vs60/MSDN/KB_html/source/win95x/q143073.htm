<P>
When you try to perform a backup, restore, or compare operation in
Microsoft Backup, or close Backup after performing one of these
operations, you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft Backup has encountered a serious error in the Memory Manager.
   Quit and restart Backup, and then try again.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This error can occur for any of the following reasons:

<UL><LI>An incompatible device driver or memory-resident program is being

<LI>The Windows swap file is damaged.

<LI>The tape drive or backup tape you are trying to use is damaged or
   incompatible with Backup.

<LI>One or more Backup files may be damaged.

<LI>The memory in your computer is faulty.
<P>
</UL>NOTE: If the above error message is displayed when you attempt to perform
