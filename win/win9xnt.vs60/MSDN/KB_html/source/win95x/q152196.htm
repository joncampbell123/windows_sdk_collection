installed in Windows 95, follow these steps to install them:

<OL><P><LI>In Control Panel, double-click Add/Remove Programs.

   Fax check boxes to select them, and then click OK.

<P><LI>Proceed through the Inbox Setup Wizard, click Finish, and then click
   Yes to restart your computer if you are prompted to do so.

   new message in Microsoft Exchange and use the following address syntax

<P>
<P><PRE>      [fax:username@9999999]
</PRE><P>
   To create a new message in Microsoft Exchange, double-click the Inbox
   icon on the desktop to start Microsoft Exchange, and then click New
   Message on the Compose menu.

   by deleting any messages it contains, or by moving the messages to a
   different folder.
<P>
   If you are unable to delete or move messages in the Outbox, delete the
   messages manually by deleting all files in the Windows\Spool\Fax
   folder.

<P><LI>Create a new Microsoft Exchange profile that contains only the
   Microsoft Fax information service. To do so, follow these steps:

   Microsoft Fax information service.
<P>
   a. In Control Panel, double-click Mail And Fax.
<P>
   b. Click Show Profiles, and then click Add. Verify that the Microsoft

      boxes that are listed to clear them, and then click Next.
</PRE><P>

   start it. To do so, follow these steps:
<P>
   a. In Microsoft Exchange, click Options on the Tools menu, and then
<P><PRE>      click the General tab.
</PRE><P>
   b. In the When Starting Microsoft Exchange area, click "Prompt for a
<P><PRE>      profile to be used," and then click OK.
</PRE><P>
   c. On the File menu, click Exit And Log Off.

      or any other components that require Microsoft Exchange, do so.
</PRE><P>
   d. Click OK.
<P>
   e. When you are prompted to restart your computer, click Yes.
<P>
   f. In Control Panel, double-click Add/Remove Programs.
<P>
   g. Click the Windows Setup tab, and then click the Microsoft Exchange
<P><PRE>      and Microsoft Fax check boxes to select them. If you also removed
      other components, click the check boxes for those components to
      select them also.
</PRE><P>
   h. Click OK and then proceed through the Inbox Setup Wizard to create a
<P><PRE>      Microsoft Exchange profile that contains only the Microsoft Fax
      information service.
</PRE><P>

   and Transmit Buffer sliders one more setting to the left. Repeat this
   process until the Receive Buffer and Transmit Buffer sliders are all
