The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95

<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you are using a single-speed CD-ROM drive that is connected to a SCSI
controller, video performance in CD-ROM-based programs may be poor. This
poor performance may be more pronounced on computers with slower
processors. Performance in these programs may appear to be worse than it
is in earlier versions of Windows.
<P>
This problem is known to occur with the following SCSI controllers:

<UL><LI>Future Domain TMC-850
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Windows 95 protected-mode CD-ROM drivers are not completely compatible
with single-speed CD-ROM drives.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, use one of the following methods:

<UL><LI>Contact the hardware manufacturer to inquire about protected-mode
   drivers for your CD-ROM drive for use with Windows 95.

<LI>You may be able to improve performance somewhat by disabling the
   Windows 95 protected-mode drivers for your CD-ROM drive, and using
   the real-mode drivers that came with the drive instead. For
   information on how to do so, contact the hardware manufacturer.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95. We
are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
