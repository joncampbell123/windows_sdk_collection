</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you start your computer, you may receive the following error message
<P>
<PRE>   DriveSpace could not mount drive 'x' due to a problem with the
   device or with your system configuration.
   You may be able to correct this problem by typing SCANDISK
   C:\Drvspace.'n' at the command prompt.
   For more information, consult your online help or documentation.

</PRE>where 'x' is a drive letter and 'n' is the corresponding DriveSpace file.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This error can occur if you have more than 15 compressed drives. DriveSpace
cannot mount more than 15 compressed drives.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Reduce the number of compressed drives to 15 by uncompressing an
appropriate number of drives. To uncompress a drive, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Start Windows 95.

<P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Programs, point to Accessories,
   point to System Tools, and then click DriveSpace.

<P><LI>Click a drive that you want to uncompress.

<P><LI>On the Drive menu, click Uncompress.

<P><LI>Repeat this process until there are only 15 compressed drives.
<P>
</OL>WARNING: Make sure that there is enough free hard disk space on the host
drive to hold the uncompressed data. If there is not enough space on the
host drive, back up and remove data to increase the free space on the host
drive.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If you run ScanDisk as the instructions in the error message suggest, you
receive the following message:
<P>
<PRE>   You cannot use DriveSpace volume C:\DBLSPACE.'n' because it is not
   mounted. To mount it so you can use the files it contains, you need to
   restart your computer.

</PRE></OL>Restarting your computer results in the original error message being
repeated.
