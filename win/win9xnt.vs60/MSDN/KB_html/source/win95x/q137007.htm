<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After you add a new set of personal folders to your active profile in
Microsoft Exchange, you can configure Microsoft Exchange so that new mail
is delivered to the new set of personal folders. When you do so, Inbox,
Outbox, and Sent Items folders are created in addition to the existing
Deleted Items folder.
<P>
If you then configure Microsoft Exchange so that new mail is delivered to
a different set of personal folders, the Inbox, Outbox, and Sent Items
folders are not removed from the personal folders that new mail was
previously delivered to. If you attempt to delete these three folders or
the Deleted Items folder, the following error message is displayed:
<P>
<PRE>   An object could not be deleted. You cannot delete the Inbox, Outbox,
   Deleted Items, or Sent Items folders.

</PRE><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To remove the Inbox, Outbox, and Sent Items folders from a set of personal
folders, you must remove the set of personal folders and then add it back
again. If the set of personal folders contains messages that you want to
keep, move those messages to a different folder, remove the set of personal
folders and add it back again, and then move the messages back to their
original location.
<P>
To remove a set of personal folders and then add it back again, follow
these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Double-click the Inbox icon on the desktop to start Microsoft Exchange.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Services.

<P><LI>Click the set of personal folders that you want to remove, and then
   click Remove.

<P><LI>Click Add.

<P><LI>Click Personal Folders, and then click OK.

<P><LI>Type a filename for the new personal folders file in the File Name
   box, click Open, and then click OK.

<P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
</OL>You can rename the set of personal folders by using the right mouse button
to click the Personal Folders icon, and then clicking Rename on the menu
that appears.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Exchange, your profile contains one set of personal folders
by default. This set of personal folders is called Personal Folders, and
contains an Inbox, Outbox, Sent Items, and Deleted Items folder. In
addition to this default set of personal folders, you can add a new set of
personal folders by clicking Services on the Tools menu, clicking Add, and
then clicking Personal Folders in the list of available information
services. The new set of personal folders contains only a Deleted Items
folder by default.
<P>
All new mail is delivered to the Inbox folder in Personal Folders by
default. When you add a new set of personal folders, you can configure
Microsoft Exchange so that new mail is delivered to the new set of personal
folders. To do so, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Options.

<P><LI>Click the Delivery tab.

<P><LI>Click the set of personal folders to which you want new mail to
   be delivered.
