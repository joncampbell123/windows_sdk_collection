<OL><P><LI> Q. What can I do if I have a problem connecting to The Microsoft
<P><PRE>       Network?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. Use the right mouse button to click The Microsoft Network icon
       on the desktop, and then click Connection Settings on the menu
       that appears. Click the Help button to start a connection
       troubleshooter that ends with a list of support phone numbers
       to use if you are still having trouble.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. How do I change my member ID, get a new password if I forget
<P><PRE>       mine, or cancel an account?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. Answers to frequently asked questions about accounts and
       billing are located in Accounts And Billing Information in the
       Accounts And Billing folder of Member Assistance. To cancel an
       account, go to the For More Information page of Accounts And
       Billing Information and click the Cancel My Account icon.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       You cannot change your member ID on an existing account. The
       only way to get a new ID is to create a new account and cancel
       your old account.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       If you forget your password, you need to call Customer Service
       in your region. Customer Service numbers are available from the
       Help menu or from the For More Information page of Accounts And
       Billing Information.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. How can I change my member information?
<P>
<P><PRE>    A. Use the following six steps to change your information:
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       1. In The Microsoft Network, open e-mail.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       2. On the Tools menu, click Address Book.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       3. On the Tools menu, click Find.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       4. Enter your member ID, click OK, and then click your name.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       5. On the File menu, click Properties.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       6. Change or delete any of the information except your member
<PRE></PRE>          ID.

       If you enter or change your date of birth, make sure to use the
       format MM/DD/YYYY or MM/DD/YY. If you omit the year, The
       Microsoft Network displays an error message indicating that the
       information could not be saved.

</PRE><P><LI> Q. Why is the Remember My Password check box on the Sign In screen
<P><PRE>       unavailable?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. The Microsoft Network uses the Windows 95 password feature as
       part of its security. If you do not use a password to start
       Windows 95, the Remember My Password option for The Microsoft
       Network is not available. To set a Windows 95 password, use the
       following five steps:
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click
<PRE></PRE>          Control Panel.

       2. Double-click the Passwords icon.

       3. On the Change Passwords tab, click the Change Windows
          Password button.

       4. Click OK.

       5. Type your password, then click OK.

</PRE><P><LI> Q. How secure is my credit card number when I use it on The
<P><PRE>       Microsoft Network?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. Your credit card number is authorized through the credit card
       network just as it is when you make a purchase in a store. When
       we authorize your credit card, we use the same security
       procedures that are in place for retail merchants. Your number
       is kept in a highly encrypted form within The Microsoft
       Network. Your number is not available to network
       administrators, marketing programs, information providers, or
       even Customer Service.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. Can I read bulletin board (BBS) messages offline?
<P>
<P><PRE>    A. No, The Microsoft Network does not have an offline reader. This
       feature is under review for a future release.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. Why do I not see BBS messages I saw previously?
<P>
<P><PRE>    A. Because of the large number of BBS messages expected on The
       Microsoft Network, messages you previously opened do not appear
       in the message list. To see a previously opened message, click
       Show All Messages on the Tools menu.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       You should also check to make sure that the message is not part
       of a collapsed conversation (or thread). To make it easier to
       see all the messages in a BBS, click Expand All Conversations
       on the View menu, or click List on the Tools menu.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. Messages I posted to a BBS did not show up. Why?
<P>
<P><PRE>    A. BBS messages do not go to the bulletin board immediately when
       you post them. Ordinarily, it takes only a few seconds to
       replicate a posting, but delays are possible.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. Does The Microsoft Network notify me if I have replies to BBS
<P><PRE>       messages I posted?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. No, you need to open the bulletin board in question and check
       for replies. You can also place a shortcut to your message on
       the desktop or in a folder.
</PRE>
<PRE>10. Q. Where can I get help if I have a problem sending e-mail from
       The Microsoft Network to other addresses?

    A. Send e-mail to "Postmaster" (without quotation marks) on The
       Microsoft Network. Please describe the problem you are having,
       including the address to which you are sending mail.
