The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
You are unable to delete, rename, or move the 386spart.par file.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The previous version of Windows installed on your computer used a 
permanent swap file named 386spart.par. This file is often retained 
when you upgrade to Windows 95.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To delete the 386spart.par file and allow Windows 95 to use a dynamic swap
file, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Restart the computer. Press the F8 key when you see the "Starting 
   Windows 95" message, and then choose Safe Mode Command Prompt Only from
   the Startup menu.

<P><LI>At the command prompt, type the following lines, pressing ENTER after 
   each line:
<P>
<P><PRE>      cd windows
      edit system.ini
</PRE>
<P><LI>Disable any of the following lines you find in the [386Enh] section by 
   placing a semicolon (;) at the beginning of the line:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Pagingfile=&lt;drive&gt;386spart.par
      PermSwapDOSDrive=C
      PermSwapSizeK=&lt;kilobytes&gt;
</PRE><P>
   Make sure to note the drive specified for the "Pagingfile=" line.

<P><LI>Save and then close the System.ini file.

<P><LI>Type the following lines, pressing ENTER after each line:
<P>
<P><PRE>      cd\ 
      deltree 386spart.par
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: If the 386spart.par file is located on a different drive from 
   the Windows folder, first change to the drive specified on the 
   "Pagingfile=" line by typing the following line and then pressing ENTER
<P>
<P><PRE>      &lt;drive&gt;:
      
</PRE>   where &lt;drive&gt;: is the drive letter. Then, type the two lines above.
 
<P><LI>Restart your computer normally.
<P>
</OL>When you restart the computer, Windows 95 creates and uses the standard 
Windows 95 swap file, which is dynamic.
<P>
To rename or move the 386spart.par file, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Restart the computer. Press the F8 key when you see the "Starting 
   Windows 95" message, and then choose Safe Mode Command Prompt Only from
   the Startup menu.

<P><LI>At the command prompt, if the 386spart.par file is located on a drive 
   other than drive C, type the following line and then press ENTER
<P>
<P><PRE>      &lt;drive&gt;:
     
</PRE>   where &lt;drive&gt;: is the drive on which the 386spart.par file is located.

<P><LI>Type the following line, and then press ENTER:
<P>
<P><PRE>      attrib -r -h -s 386spart.par
</PRE>
<P><LI>To rename or move the 386spart.par file, use the appropriate method:
<P>
</OL><h3>Rename</h3>
 
<P>
To rename the 386spart.par file, type the following line, and then press 
ENTER:
<P>
<PRE>   ren 386spart.par 386spart.paa

</PRE></OL>NOTE: This command assumes you do not have a file named 386spart.paa. If 
you do have a file named 386spart.paa, select a file name extension that 
is not currently in use.
<P>
<P><h3>Move</h3>
 
<P>
To move the 386spart.par file, type the following line, and press then 
ENTER
<P>
<PRE>   move 386spart.par &lt;drive&gt;: &lt;path&gt;\&lt;filename&gt;

</PRE>where &lt;drive&gt;: is the drive on which the 386spart.par file is located.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The 386spart.par file is the Windows 3.x permanent swap file. The 
386spart.par file has a fixed size and must occupy contiguous clusters 
at a fixed location on the drive. The Spart.par file located in the 
Windows folder is the pointer file that tells Windows on which drive the 
386spart.par file is located and how large it is. These two files provide 
virtual memory for Windows 3.x, which can be inherited by Windows 95 when 
you upgrade.
<P>
The default Windows 95 swap file (Win386.swp) is located in the Windows 
folder and can be non-contiguous. The Win386.swp file size changes 
dynamically with the demands from the system. Windows 95 creates this file
at startup if the file is not found.
<P>
When you upgrade a Windows 3.x installation that uses a permanent swap 
file, Windows 95 may use the existing 386spart.par file as its swap file 
instead of creating the Win386.swp file. When Windows 95 uses the 
386spart.par file, the file can grow in size if the system requires more 
virtual memory, but it can never shrink below the size defined by the 
"PermSwapSizeK=" line.
