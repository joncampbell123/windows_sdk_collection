The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
<LI>Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how to set up one or more Internet service
providers and Internet mail for use with Microsoft Exchange in Windows 95.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Before you can use Windows 95 to access the Internet you must have an
account with an Internet service provider.
<P>
<P><h3>Requirements</h3>
 
<P>
To configure Dial-Up Networking to work with an Internet service provider,
you must obtain the following information from the service provider:

<UL><LI>User name
<LI>Password
<LI>Access phone number
<LI>Required protocol
<LI>Host and domain name
<LI>DNS (Name Service) if an IP address
<LI>Logon procedure
<P>
</UL>If the service provider requires that you use a dedicated static IP address
each time you log on, you will also need the following information:

<UL><LI>Your IP address
<LI>Subnet mask (optional)
<LI>IP address for the default gateway (optional)
<P>
</UL>NOTE: Not all of the above information is required with all service
providers.
<P>
<P><h3>Setting Up the Dial-Up Adapter</h3>
 
<P>
To set up the Dial-Up adapter, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Use the right mouse button to click Network Neighborhood, then click
   Properties on the menu that appears.

<P><LI>Check to see if the dial-up adapter is installed. If it is not, go to
   step 3. If the dial-up adapter is already installed, go to step 4.

<P><LI>Click the Add button, double-click Adapter, click Microsoft in the
   Manufacturer box, click Dial-Up Adapter in the Network Adapters box,
   then click OK.

<P><LI>Check to see if "TCP/IP -&gt; Dial-Up Adapter" is installed in the network
   components box. If it is not, follow these steps:
<P>
   a. Click the Add button.
<P>
   b. Double-click Protocol.
<P>
   c. In the Manufacturer box, click Microsoft.
<P>
   d. In the Network Protocols box, click TCP/IP.
<P>
   e. Click OK.

<P><LI>Click OK. When you are prompted to restart your computer, click Yes.
<P>
</OL><h3>Setting up the Service Provider</h3>
 
<P>
Once you have set up the dial-up adapter, use the following steps to create
a connectoid for each service provider:

<OL><P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Programs, point to Accessories, then
   click Dial-Up Networking.

<P><LI>Double-click Make New Connection.

<P><LI>Proceed through the Make New Connection Wizard to create the
   connectoid.

<P><LI>Use the right mouse button to click the new connectoid, then click
   Properties on the menu that appears.

<P><LI>Click Server Type. In the Allowed Network Protocols area, click the
   NetBEUI and IPX/SPX Compatible check boxes to clear them (unless they
   are required) and then click TCP/IP settings.

<P><LI>If a static IP address is required, click Specify An IP Address and
   type the address.

<P><LI>If a dynamic address is required (this is the case for most providers),
   click Server Assigned IP Address.

<P><LI>If a DNS name server is provided, click Specify Name Server Address
   and type the appropriate address.

<P><LI>Click OK until you exit connectoid properties.
<P>
</OL>To create multiple connectoids (for multiple service providers) repeat
steps 1-9 for each service provider.
<P>
<P><h3>Setting up Internet Mail</h3>
 
<P>
To use Internet mail with Microsoft Exchange you must install Microsoft
Plus! for Windows 95. You set host names for Internet mail services in the
Internet Mail profile. To set up the Internet Mail profile, follow these
steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Settings, then click Control Panel.

<P><LI>Double-click Mail And Fax.

<P><LI>Click Add, click Internet Mail, and then click OK.

<P><LI>Add Personal Address Book and Personal Folders to the profile. You can
   combine the files with existing PST and PAB folders, or you can
   rename them and place them where you want them.

<P><LI>When Internet Mail, Personal Address Book, and Personal Folders are
   included in the profile, click Internet Mail and then click Properties.

<P><LI>On the General tab, modify the settings for the connection. Make sure
   that all the necessary information is included. The Domain Server Name
   (DNS) information is required for most service provider mail
   connections. This is placed under Mailbox Information in the
   Internet Mail Server box.

<P><LI>Click OK to finish the profile.
<P>
</OL><h3>Prompting for a Profile</h3>
 
<P>
If you have multiple service providers, you can cause Microsoft Exchange to
prompt you for the profile to use when you start Microsoft Exchange. To do
so, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Start Microsoft Exchange.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Options.

<P><LI>On the General tab, click "Prompt for a profile to be used."

<P><LI>Click OK.
<P></OL>
