This article describes how to access your local Microsoft Exchange mail
and address book from a remote computer when the local computer is

<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To access your local Microsoft Exchange mail and address book from a
remote computer, follow the steps in the following sections.
<P>
<P><h3>Sharing the Local Address Book and Mail Folders</h3>
 
<P>
Follow these steps on the local computer:

<OL><P><LI>In Windows Explorer, use the right mouse button to click the folder
   containing your address book (.pab) and mail folder (.pst) files,
   and then click Sharing on the menu that appears. (These files are
   often located in the Exchange folder on drive C.)

<P><LI>Click Shared As, and grant Full Access rights to the share. Set a
   password for the share, if necessary. Click OK.
<P>
   NOTE: You must have the File and Printer Sharing service installed
   in order to share the folder.
<P>
</OL><h3>Setting Up a Profile on the Remote Computer</h3>
 
<P>
Follow these steps on the remote computer:

<OL><P><LI>Use the right mouse button to click the Inbox icon on the desktop,
   and then click Properties on the menu that appears.

<P><LI>If a profile is already in use, click Show Profiles, and then click
   Add. If no profile exists, simply click Add.

<P><LI>Clear all check boxes except the Microsoft Mail check box, and then
   click Next.

<P><LI>Type a name for the profile, and then click Next.

<P><LI>Type the path for the network location of the post office, and then
   click Next. For example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      \\&lt;server&gt;\wgpo0000
</PRE>
<P><LI>Click the appropriate user name in the list of names, click Next,
   and then type the password for the post office account.

<P><LI>Type the path for your personal address book on the local computer,
   and then click Next. For example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      \\&lt;computername&gt;\&lt;sharename&gt;\mailbox.pab
</PRE>
<P><LI>Type the path for your personal information store (mail folders)
   file, and then click Next. For example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      \\&lt;computername&gt;\&lt;sharename&gt;\mailbox.pst
</PRE>
<P><LI>When you are prompted whether you want the Inbox placed in your
   Startup group, click the appropriate option, click Next, and then
   click Finish.
<P>
</OL><h3>Choosing a Profile</h3>
 
<P>
If you have more than one profile, you can cause Microsoft Exchange to
prompt you for the profile to be used when you start Microsoft Exchange.
To do so, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Start Microsoft Exchange.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Options.

<P><LI>In the When Starting Microsoft Exchange box, click "Prompt for a
   profile to be used," and then click OK.
<P>
</OL><h3>Error Messages</h3>
 
<P>
You may receive the following error messages:

<UL><LI>Your Personal Address Book could not be opened.
   Another application is already using your Personal Address Book.
   You must close that application before you can use your Personal
   Address Book in this application.

<LI>The set of folders could not be opened. The file
   \\machinename\sharename\mailbox.pst could not be accessed
   because it is in use by another process.
<P>
</UL>If you receive these error messages, Microsoft Exchange is running on
more than one computer and trying to use the same .pab and .pst files.
Only one instance of Microsoft Exchange can use a set of .pab and .pst
files at a time. You must close Microsoft Exchange on one or more
computers so that only one instance of Microsoft Exchange is trying to
use the .pab and .pst files.
