<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you are using the IPX/SPX-compatible protocol that is included in
Windows 95 to communicate across an IPX router, some communications may
not work if the router requires a smaller packet size than is used by the
LAN media (Ethernet or Token Ring, for example).
<P>
In some cases, NCP-based communications with NetWare servers may succeed,
but operations using other protocols running over IPX, such as SPX or
NetBIOS, may not work.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
You may be able to work around such routing restrictions by manually
limiting the size of IPX packets sent by the communicating systems.
However, when you are using the version of the IPX/SPX-compatible protocol
that is included in Windows 95 (all versions), it is not possible to
manually specify a maximum IPX packet size.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
It may be possible to work around this issue by limiting the maximum
packet size sent by the network adapter itself. Not all network adapter
drivers provide such a feature, and implementing such a feature, if it
exists, may vary among network adapter drivers. Contact your network
adapter manufacturer for more information about this possible workaround.
<P>
It may also be possible to resolve this issue by a configuration change or
updated software or firmware on the router itself. Contact your router
manufacturer for more information about this possible workaround.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95 and
OEM Service Release 2 (OSR2). An update to address this problem is now
available, but is not fully regression tested and should be applied only
to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you are severely
impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft does not recommend
implementing this update at this time. Contact Microsoft Technical Support
for additional information about the availability of this update.
