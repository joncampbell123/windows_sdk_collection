<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The ATAPI IDE driver in Windows 95 (Esdi_506.pdr) does not include
functionality for the following features:

<UL><LI>SMART support (the ability for certain programs to predict whether a
   hard disk failure may occur)
<LI>DMA support for ATAPI devices
<LI>ATAPI tape drive support
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The functionality for these features is not built into the Windows 95 IDE
driver. However, Microsoft has released an updated Esdi_506.pdr file that
supports these features as follows:

<UL><LI>SMART provides support for SMART programs, which will be able to
   predict some hard disk failures. The updated driver itself does not
   provide this functionality, but provides the support for SMART
   programs to implement this functionality.

<LI>DMA (also called bus mastering) reduces CPU overhead by providing a
   mechanism for data transfers that do not have to be monitored by the
   CPU. Transfer rate for a particular transfer will not noticeably
   increase, but the CPU overhead should be significantly reduced in DMA
   mode. (For example, a 10 percent CPU overhead may be observed for DMA
   transfers versus a 30 percent CPU overhead for PIO transfers, in
   typical ATAPI CD-ROM transfers.)

<LI>ATAPI tape drive support is included in the IDE driver, which will
   allow a backup program that supports ATAPI tape to be used.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95. An
update to address this problem is now available, but is not fully
regression-tested and should be applied only to systems experiencing
this specific problem. Unless you are severely impacted by this
specific problem, Microsoft does not recommend implementing this update
at this time.
<P>
This issue is resolved by the following updated file for Windows 95:
