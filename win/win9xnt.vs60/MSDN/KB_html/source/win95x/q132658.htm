<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use a shortcut for a file on a NetWare 3.x or 4.x server, or on a
Windows 95-based computer running the File And Printer Sharing For NetWare
Networks component, if the file has been removed or renamed the shortcut
may open another similarly named file in the same folder without prompting
you. This behavior can occur with shortcuts that user either mapped drives
or UNC paths.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The shortcut facility in Windows 95 deals with missing files by searching
for a file with similar characteristics and prompting you. One of the most
prominent characteristics is the file creation date and time. On NetWare
3.x and 4.x servers, and Windows 95-based computers running the File And
Printer Sharing For NetWare Networks component, the creation date is set
with a resolution of two seconds. This means that two files copied to the
server within a two-second span may have the same file creation date and
time. This can cause the shortcut facility's missing file detection process
to misdetect the file.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
The only workaround for this problem is to change the shortcut to point to
the proper file.
