The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Office 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After you install Microsoft Office 97 on your computer, you may receive
the following error message when you open an image file in Microsoft
Paint:
<P>
<PRE>   This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down.
   If the problem persists, contact the program vendor.

</PRE>If you click Details, you receive an error message similar to the
Following message:
<P>
<PRE>   MSPAINT caused an invalid page fault in module MSPAINT.EXE at
   0137:0042d3fe.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs because of a conflict between Microsoft Paint and the
graphics import filters included with Microsoft Office 97.
<P>
The problem may occur when you open the following types of files:
<P>
<PRE>   DRW
   EPS
   GIF
   JPEG
   JPG
   PCD
   PICT
   TGA
   TIFF

</PRE>The problem may also occur when you open any other type of file that
requires a graphics import filter.
<P>
The problem does not occur when you open PCX (PC Paintbrush) or BMP
(Windows bitmap) image files.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Windows 95</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Download the Paint95.exe file from the Microsoft Software Library to
   an empty folder.

<P><LI>Double-click the file you downloaded in step 1 to expand it.

<P><LI>Copy the Mspaint.exe file to the Program Files\Accessories folder.

<P><LI>Copy the three .dll files to the Windows\System folder.

<P><LI>Restart your computer.
<P>
</OL><h3>Windows NT 4.0</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Download the Paintnt.exe file from the Microsoft Software Library to
   an empty folder.

<P><LI>Double-click the file you downloaded in step 1 to expand it.

<P><LI>Copy the .exe and .dll files to the Winnt\System32 folder.
<P>
   NOTE: You may not be able to copy the Msvcrt.dll file if it is in use.
   If this is the case, boot your computer to Windows 95 or MS-DOS and
   then copy the file. If your hard drive uses the NTFS file system, you
   must rename the file first, and then copy the new Msvcrt.dll file.
<P>
   If you receive an error message stating "Cannot rename Msvcrt: The
   specified file is being used by Windows" you must rename the original
   Msvcrt.dll file and copy the new version to the Winnt\System32 folder
   from a Windows NT command prompt.

<P><LI>Restart your computer.
<P>
</OL><h3>Obtaining the Updated Files</h3>

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>

Windows. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>

The graphics import filters included with Microsoft Office 97 are not
compatible with the versions of Microsoft Paint included with Microsoft

Microsoft Paint unless they are either PCX or BMP files.
