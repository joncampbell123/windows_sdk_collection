<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article contains a copy of the information in the Windows 95 
Customer Advisory.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Symptom:
<P>
When a floppy-based Setup gets to disk 2, it can halt with a message 
indicating a bad disk 2, or may be unable to locate disk 2 even though 
you have inserted it in the drive. You will be required to exit Setup at 
that time. Since it is early in the process there should be no effect on 
your ability to run your previous configuration.
<P>
The Cause:
<P>
We have tracked down a handful of disk sets nationwide from customers 
who have reported this problem. In every case, the second disk turned 
out to have been corrupted by a virus on the customer's computer that 
had infected the second disk during Setup. In each case, the virus was 
on the customer's computer prior to the installation of Windows 95 and 
not caused by the Windows 95 disks. This generally happens on disk 2 
because this is the disk that stores customer registration information, 
so Setup writes to this disk. The virus, which installs itself 
undetected on a typical floppy disk, is exposed because of the unique 
high-density format used for Windows 95 distribution diskettes.
<P>
How can a customer prevent this:
<P>
There are several viruses that can cause this problem. The best way to 
eliminate the problem for good is to run an anti-virus program and scan 
the computer for viruses before upgrading. This is recommended on the 
disk labels. Because viruses can be difficult to get rid of completely, 
you should reboot your computer and check for viruses a second time 
after you believe the virus has been removed. All Windows 95 disks 
should be write-protected when possible. Disk 2 can be write-protected 
when your information has already been recorded from a previous Windows 
95 Setup. A floppy disk is write-protected when the tab on the top of 
floppy disk is flipped up so that you can see through the hole. 
<P>
What a customer should do if this happens:
<P>
Once the virus has infected disk 2, the disk cannot be used. Please call 
(800) 207-7766 or Microsoft Product Support Services for updated disks.
