<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run Berkeley Systems After Dark with Windows 95, the following
problems occur:

<UL><LI>When you install the After Dark screen saver, an After Dark button
   is created on the taskbar; however, clicking this button with the left
   mouse button does not open the After Dark control panel.

<LI>A blank button appears on the taskbar when the After Dark screen
   saver is active.

<LI>A button labeled "Password" appears on the taskbar when the Password
   dialog box appears.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
According to Berkeley Systems Technical Support, After Dark version 2.0 for
Windows and its add-on components based on the After Dark 2.0 engine are
not fully compatible with Windows 95.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 

<UL><LI>If you click the After Dark button using the right (secondary mouse
   button, the Control menu appears. The After Dark control panel is one of
   the selections. You can also click the After Dark icon on the desktop,
   rather than the button on the taskbar, to open the After Dark control
   panel.

<LI>The blank button on the taskbar serves no function, but it cannot be
   disabled.

<LI>The button labeled "Password" on the taskbar serves no function;
   however, the only way to prevent it from appearing is to disable After
   Dark's password support.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
After Dark is manufactured by a Berkeley Systems, a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this
