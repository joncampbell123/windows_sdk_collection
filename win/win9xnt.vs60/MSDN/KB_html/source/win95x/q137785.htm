The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you dial a long distance number using a 32-bit communications program
in Windows 95, the number 1 is automatically dialed before the area code
of the number to be dialed. Dialing 1 first for a long distance call is
appropriate for most phone systems, but some systems require you to dial a
number other than 1.
<P>
This article describes how to configure Windows 95 to dial a number other
than 1 to begin a long distance call.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To configure Windows 95 to dial a number other than one to begin a long
distance call, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>In Control Panel, double-click the Modems icon.

<P><LI>Click Dialing Properties.

<P><LI>Click New, type a name for the new location in the dialog box that
   appears, and then click OK.

<P><LI>Click the Dial Using Calling Card check box to select it, and then
   click New in the dialog box that appears.

<P><LI>Type a name for the new calling card in the dialog box that appears,
   click OK, and then click Advanced.

<P><LI>Type "G" (without quotation marks) in the Calls Within The Same Area
   Code box.

<P><LI>Type "&lt;n&gt;FG" (without quotation marks) in the Long Distance Calls
   box, where &lt;n&gt; is the number you want to use in place of 1. For
   example, if you want to use 8 in place of 1, type "8FG" in the Long
   Distance Calls box.

<P><LI>Type "&lt;n&gt;1EFG" (without quotation marks) in the International Calls
   box, where &lt;n&gt; is the number you want to use in place of 1. For
   example, if you want to use 8 in place of 1, type "81EFG" in the
   International Calls box.

<P><LI>Click Close, and then click OK.
<P>
</OL>When you want to dial a long distance number using a communications
program, configure the program to use this new location.
<P>
NOTE: "G" inserts the telephone number. "F" inserts the area code. "E"
inserts the country code.
<P>
Note that this method works only with 32-bit communications programs that
support the Telephony Application Programming Interface (TAPI). You cannot
use this method if you already use a calling card to dial long distance.
When you choose a calling card in the Change Calling Card dialog box, the
advanced settings are set automatically and cannot be changed.
<P>
Another method that you can use for a single HyperTerminal or Dial-Up
Networking connection, or for The Microsoft Network, is to change the
area code of the number to be dialed to match your own area code, and
then enter the entire 10-digit number you want to dial in the Phone Number
box.
<P>
For example, if your local area code is 555, enter 555 in the Area Code
box and a phone number such as "8 123 456-7890" (without quotation marks)
in the Phone Number box. Windows 95 dials this phone number exactly as it
appears in the Phone Number box. When you use this method, dialing options
such as call waiting or outside line access numbers are used.
