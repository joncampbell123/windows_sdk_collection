<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Windows 95 does not include Write, a word processing tool included with
earlier versions of Windows. Write has been replaced with WordPad, a word
processing tool with more features. For backward compatibility, Windows 95
includes a file called Write.exe located in the Windows folder.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Write.exe file included with Windows 95 is a small program that accepts
the same parameters as the version of Write included with earlier versions
of Windows. The Write.exe file included with Windows 95 starts WordPad and
then passes the command-line parameters to WordPad. This behavior allows 16-
bit programs that use Write.exe to run without modification in Windows 95.
32-bit programs should use WordPad instead of Write for future portability.
<P>
If you want to use the version of Write included with earlier versions of
Windows, you must expand the Write.exe file from your original Windows or
Windows for Workgroups version 3.x disks. To do so, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Rename the Write.exe file in the Windows folder to a different
   name.

<P><LI>Locate the Write.ex_ file using the table below. Insert the
   appropriate disk in a floppy disk drive.

<P><LI>At a command prompt, type the following command and then press ENTER:
<P>
<P><PRE>      expand -r a:\write.ex_ c:\windows
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: This steps assumes you have inserted the floppy disk in drive
   A and that Windows 95 is installed in the Windows folder on drive C.
   If you are using a different drive or folder, modify the line in
   step 3 accordingly.
