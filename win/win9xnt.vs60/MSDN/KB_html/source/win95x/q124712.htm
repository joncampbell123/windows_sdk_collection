<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run the Novell NetWare Administrator program (Nwadmin.exe) on a
computer running Windows 95 configured with the Microsoft Client for
NetWare Networks, an MS-DOS window may open and display the following error
message:
<P>
<PRE>   This program must be run under Microsoft Windows

</PRE>When you run Nwadmin.exe on a computer running Windows 95 configured with
the Microsoft Service for NetWare Directory Services (NDS) you may receive
one of the following error messages:

<UL><LI>Invalid Context

<LI>Unknown Object Type

<LI>Cannot read object's information

<LI>Program Error
   Your program is making an invalid dynamic link call to a .DLL file
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Client for NetWare Networks</h3>
 
<P>
The NetWare Administrator program does not work with the Microsoft Client
for NetWare Networks. The NetWare Administrator program works only with
Novell VLM (the NetWare MS-DOS requester).
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Service for NetWare Directory Services (NDS)</h3>
 
<P>
The error messages stated above may occur if Netware.drv, Nwadmin.exe, and
all the required .dll files do not match.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Client for NetWare Networks</h3>
 
<P>
You must use the real-mode VLM instead of the Microsoft Client for NetWare
Networks in order to use the NetWare Administrator program. Contact Novell
Technical Support if you need technical assistance configuring VLM.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Service for NetWare Directory Services (NDS)</h3>
 
<P>
Perform the following steps to run Nwadmin.exe with the Microsoft Service
for NetWare Directory Services (NDS):

<OL><P><LI>Make sure that the Netware.drv file you are using is the one included
   with the Microsoft Service for NetWare Directory Services (NDS).

<P><LI>Make sure that you have at least version 4.10.2 of Nwadmin.exe and its
   required .dll files. These .dll files are supplied by Novell and should
   be located in the public folder from which you are running Nwadmin.exe.

<P><LI>Make sure that you have the latest .dll files from Nwdll2.exe in your
   Windows\System folder. The most recent version of Nwadmin.exe is in
   41nwad.exe and is available on Novell s FTP site.  Nwdll2.exe is also
   available at this location.
