The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
<LI>Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release versions 1, 2, 2.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When group policies are used on Windows 95 workstations in a Microsoft
Windows NT domain, the policies associated with the user's group member-
ship may not be applied at logon. Instead, the policies associated with
the Default user may be applied.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The primary domain controller (PDC) for the domain is not available at
logon. Users are validated by a backup domain controller (BDC) instead.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this behavior, use one of the following methods:

<UL><LI>Remove the Default user from the Config.pol file.
<P>
   This causes the settings for the last user who logged on to that
   workstation to be retained. This may be an acceptable solution if the
   same user generally logs on to the same workstation.

<LI>Define the settings for the Default user to be an acceptable default
   if the specific group policies cannot be applied. Define different
   policies for individual users for whom these defaults would not be
   appropriate.
<P>
   This method may be effective if most users can operate with a certain
   base configuration and only a few require a different configuration.

<LI>Configure system policies to be updated by manual download from a
   predefined location instead of automatically.
<P>
   When you are configured for automatic download and load balancing is
   not enabled, system policies are downloaded from the PDC only. When
   you are configured for automatic download and load balancing is
   enabled, system policies are downloaded from the PDC or BDC that
   validates the user's logon. When you are configured for manual down-
   load, system policies are downloaded from a specific, pre-defined path.

<LI>Enable user profiles, set the users' Home directories on a Windows NT
   BDC instead of the PDC, and remove the Default user from the Config.pol
   file.
<P>
   When user profiles are enabled in a Windows NT domain, a user's profile
   is saved to and loaded from the user's home directory (as defined in
   Windows NT User Manager for Domains) by default. This allows for
   "roving" user profiles.
<P>
   When a user logs on, the appropriate user profile is downloaded and
   applied to the local computer. Then, group policies are applied.
   Because there is no Default user defined, if the PDC is unavailable the
   settings in the previously saved user profile are used instead.
<P>
   This method is useful if the BDC is on a local LAN segment and the PDC
   is on a remote link that is less reliable, so that the BDC is more
   likely to be available than the PDC. This also allows proper user
   configurations to be applied regardless of the local computer on which
   a user logs on.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95 and
OEM Service Release 2 (OSR2). An update to address this problem is now
available, but is not fully regression tested and should be applied only
to computers experiencing this specific problem. Unless you are severely
impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft does not recommend
implementing this update at this time. Contact Microsoft Technical Support
for additional information about the availability of this update.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When group policies are in use, Windows 95 attempts to contact only the PDC
to determine the user's group membership. Windows 95 does not attempt to
query the BDC for this information, even though the user's logon may have
been validated by the BDC. This occurs even if load balancing is enabled.

95 Resource Kit.
