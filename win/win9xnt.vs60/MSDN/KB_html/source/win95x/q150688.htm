<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11
<LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In certain cases, you may need to delete and re-create a post office. If
you do so, you must make sure not to delete a retail Microsoft Mail post
office instead of the Workgroup post office installed with Windows for
Workgroups or Windows 95. This article describes how to determine the
difference between post offices.
<P>
For additional information about deleting and re-creating a Workgroup post
office, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : How to Delete and Re-create a WFWG Post Office

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The primary method of determining the difference between a Workgroup post
office and a retail Microsoft Mail post office is the root folder. The
default root folder names for post offices are as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   Product                               Root folder
   -----------------------------------------------------------
   Windows for Workgroups 3.1 and 3.11   &lt;x&gt;:\Windows\WGPO
   Windows 95                            &lt;x&gt;:\Windows\WGPO0000
   Retail Microsoft Mail                 &lt;net drive&gt;:\MAILDATA

</PRE>Note that Windows 95 increments the numerical value of the post office
name as additional post offices are created. This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h3>Additional Differences</h3>
 
<P>
The root folder of a post office can be created with any valid name.
However, even if a custom name is used for the root folder, the internal
folder structure must remain named as it was during creation and all
folder structures must be maintained.
<P>
In these cases, use the following differences to determine the version of
the post office.

<UL><LI>A Windows 95 or Windows for Workgroups post office has 32 files in the
   GLB folder. A retail Microsoft Mail post office has at least 72 files.

<LI>If the GLB folder contains files with .mdm or .scr extensions, it is a
   retail Microsoft Mail post office. These files are modem script files
   for use with the administrator tools included with retail Microsoft
   Mail.
