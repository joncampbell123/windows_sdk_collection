<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how to merge the Microsoft Service for NetWare
Directory Services policy file (Maple.adm) with the Admin.adm policy file
included with Windows 95 to create a policy file that incorporates all
policies from both files.
<P>
For information about how to obtain the Microsoft Service for NetWare
Directory Services, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : Microsoft Service for NetWare Directory Services Available

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Service for NetWare Directory Services (MSNDS) includes a
file named Maple.adm that contains MSNDS-specific policies. This file is
used with System Policy Editor as a template to create policy files.
<P>
You can change the template in System Policy Editor by clicking Template
on the Options menu, and then selecting the Maple.adm file.
<P>
Windows 95 includes a file named Admin.adm that is used for most policies.
It is located in the Windows\Inf folder.
<P>
To create a policy file that incorporates both templates, follow these
steps:

<OL><P><LI>Use any text editor (such as Notepad) to open the Admin.adm file
   in the Windows\Inf folder.

<P><LI>Run a second instance of the text editor and open the Maple.adm file
   in the folder containing MSNDS.

<P><LI>Copy the text in the Maple.adm file beginning with
<P>
<P><PRE>      CATEGORY !!NWClient4
</PRE><P>
   and ending with:
<P>
<P><PRE>      END CATEGORY; Microsoft NetWare-Compatible Network
</PRE><P>
   Paste the text into the Admin.adm file before the following section:
<P>
<P><PRE>      CATEGORY !!AccessControl
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: When you copy the text in the Maple.adm file, make sure to
   include the CATEGORY and END CATEGORY lines in the text you are
   copying.

<P><LI>Copy the text in the Maple.adm file in the [Strings] section. Paste
   the text into the bottom of the [Strings] section in the Admin.adm
   file.

<P><LI>Save the Admin.adm file as a file named Merged.adm.

<P><LI>In System Policy Editor, click Template on the Options menu, and
   select the Merged.adm file. Note that you must close any open
   policy file before changing the template.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: System Policy Editor is not included in the floppy disk version of
Windows 95. You can download Policy.exe, a self-extracting executable file
containing Poledit.exe, from online services. Please see the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base for information about downloading
Policy.exe:
