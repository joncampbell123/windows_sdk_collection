</UL> 
<P>
This article describes troubleshooting steps that may help you solve
problems printing in Windows 95. This information is also available in our
Windows 95 Print Troubleshooting Wizard. We recommend using this wizard,
but we have also created this text-based article for your convenience. The
Windows 95 Print Troubleshooting Wizard is located on:
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A href="http://support.microsoft.com/support/tshoot/default.asp">http://support.microsoft.com/support/tshoot/default.asp</A></B>

</PRE><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes troubleshooting steps that may help you solve
printing problems in Microsoft Windows 95.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Printers.txt</h3>
 
<P>
Windows 95 includes a file called Printers.txt. This file is located in
the Windows folder and contains information about known printing issues.
This file may help you solve printing problems.
<P>
<P><h3>Print Troubleshooter</h3>
 
<P>
Windows 95 includes a Print Troubleshooter tool. Before you perform any
troubleshooting steps, try the Print Troubleshooter tool. To use the Print
Troubleshooter tool, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click the Start button, then click Help.

<P><LI>On the Contents tab, double-click the Troubleshooting topic.

<P><LI>Double-click the If You Have Trouble Printing topic.
<P>
</OL>Note that the Windows 95 Resource Kit also includes a Print Troubleshooter
tool. This tool is more detailed than the Print Troubleshooter in Windows
95. This tool is also available on the Windows 95 Upgrade CD-ROM in the
following folder:
<P>
<PRE>   Other\Misc\Epts\Epts.exe

</PRE></OL><h3>Online Help</h3>
 
<P>
In addition to the Print Troubleshooter, there is extensive online help
available in Windows 95. Click a printer option field with the right mouse
button, then click "What's This?" on the menu that appears to see detailed
information about that option.
<P>
<P><h3>Print from an MS-DOS Prompt</h3>
 
<P>
If you cannot print at all in Windows 95, try the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Verify that the printer is turned on and is online without any
   printer errors.

<P><LI>Perform a self-test on the printer. The method for performing a
   self-test is different for different printers. Check your printer's
   documentation for instructions.
<P>
   If the self-test fails, contact your printer manufacturer for
   assistance.

<P><LI>If possible, set up the printer on your local computer. Verify that
   no printer sharing devices or daisy-chained devices (such as SCSI
   CD-ROMs) are between the computer and printer.

<P><LI>Restart your computer. Press the F8 key when you see the "Starting
   Windows 95" message, then choose "Safe mode command prompt only."
<P>
   NOTE: Windows-based applications cannot print when you start Windows
   95 in Safe mode.

<P><LI>Type the following line and then press ENTER:
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy c:\autoexec.bat lpt1
</PRE><P>
   For a PostScript printer, type
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy c:\&lt;path&gt;\testps.txt lpt1
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;path&gt; is the location of the Windows\SYSTEM directory.
<P>
   NOTE: If your printer is not connected to LPT1, substitute the correct
   port name in the lines above.
<P>
   These commands copy a file to the printer. If the file is not printed,
   there may be a problem with the port, the cable, or the printer. You
   may want to try using a different printer cable or a different printer.
   When you print to a laser printer, you may need to press the Form Feed
   key after the printer has received the print job; otherwise, the
   printer may not eject the paper.
<P>
</OL><h3>Try the Alternate Lpt.vxd File</h3>
 
<P>
There is an alternate Lpt.vxd file that resolves the following problems:

<UL><LI>You cannot print or you receive timeout error messages on recent
   Compaq computers when you print to any bidirectional printer.

<LI>You experience problems printing to any bidirectional printer on a
   computer with a PS/2-style LPT port. Symptoms include an extra page
   being printed, PJL commands appearing on the printout, or other various
   symptoms.

<LI>You cannot use Device Manager to set an ECP port to run in standard
   LPT mode. This can occur on computers with a Plug and Play BIOS that
   enumerates only ECP parallel ports.
<P>
</UL>The alternate Lpt.vxd file is located in the Drivers\Printer\Lpt folder
on the Windows 95 CD-ROM.
<P>
This file is also included in the self-extracting A1701.exe file.
<P>
This file is available for download from the following Microsoft FTP site:
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A href="ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/services/whql/drivers/win95/printr/">ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/Services/whql/drivers/win95/printr/</A></B>

</PRE></OL>To install the alternate Lpt.vxd file, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Using Windows Explorer, rename the Lpt.vxd file in the Windows\System
   folder to Lpt.old.

<P><LI>Copy the Lpt.vxd file from the Drivers\Printer\Lpt folder on the
   Windows 95 CD-ROM to the Windows\System folder on the hard disk.
<P>
   -or-
<P>
   Download the Lpt.vxd file from the Microsoft World Wide Web site to
   an empty folder, and then copy it to the Windows\System folder on
   the hard disk.

<P><LI>Restart Windows 95.
<P>
</OL>Note that the alternate Lpt.vxd file has the same file size and date as
the original file. The version number of the alternate Lpt.vxd file is
4.00.503 or 4.00.951. You can determine the version number by using the
right mouse button to click the Lpt.vxd file, and then clicking Properties
on the menu that appears.
<P>
<P><h3>Print from Notepad and WordPad</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>With the printer still connected locally, restart your computer
   normally.

<P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Programs, point to Accessories,
   then click Notepad or WordPad.

<P><LI>Type some text in Notepad or WordPad and then try to print the text.
<P>
</OL><h3>Device Manager Settings</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>If you cannot print from Notepad, verify that the port is set up
   correctly in Device Manager (for example, verify that there are no
   conflicts and that the port's resources are set correctly).
<P>
   NOTE: To open Device Manager, use the right mouse button to click My
   Computer and then click Properties on the menu that appears.

<P><LI>Click the Device Manager tab, double-click "Ports (COM &amp; LPT),"
   then double-click the appropriate port for your printer [for
   example, "Printer Port (LPT1)"].

<P><LI>Click the Resources tab and verify that the settings are correct
   for your printer port. For example, the input/output range for a
   standard LPT1 port is 0378-037A (a physical LPT2 port typically
   uses I/O 278). Also verify that the conflicting devices list
   reads "No conflicts."
<P>
</OL><h3>Disable the Enhanced Capabilities Port</h3>
 
<P>
If you have problems printing or experience garbled printout using an
enhanced capabilities port, follow these steps to disable the enhanced
capabilities port:

<OL><P><LI>In Control Panel, double-click System.

<P><LI>On the Device Manager tab, double-click the "Ports (COM &amp; LPT)" branch.

<P><LI>Double-click the ECP port.

<P><LI>On the Driver tab, click Change Driver.

<P><LI>Click Show All Devices.

<P><LI>In the Manufacturers box, click Standard Port Types. In the Models
   box, click Printer Port, and then click OK. Click OK until you return
   to Control Panel.

<P><LI>Follow the steps in the "Try the Alternate Lpt.vxd File" section
   above to install the alternate Lpt.vxd file.
<P>
</OL>Notes:

<UL><LI>You may also need to change printer-related settings using the
   computer's CMOS setup utility to disable the enhanced capabilities
   port. For information about doing so, please consult the computer's
   documentation or manufacturer.

<LI>The alternate Lpt.vxd file does not work for some Compaq computers and
   you cannot disable the ECP port on these computers. If you cannot print
   to an inkjet, dot-matrix, or laserjet printer from a Compaq computer
   due to problems with the ECP port, the alternate Lpt.vxd file does not
   fix the problem, and you cannot disable the ECP port in the computer's
   CMOS settings, obtain the Sp1516.exe file from Compaq. This file
   contains a driver that is loaded in the Autoexec.bat file to disable
   the ECP port.
<P>
</UL><h3>Remove and Reinstall the Printer Port</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>If a conflict exists or the port's settings are incorrect, use
   Device Manager to remove the printer port.
<P>
   NOTE: To open Device Manager, use the right mouse button to click My
   Computer and then click Properties on the menu that appears.

<P><LI>Click the Device Manager tab, double-click "Ports (COM &amp; LPT),"
   then click the appropriate port for your printer [for example,
   "Printer Port (LPT1)"].

<P><LI>Click the Remove button and then restart your computer.

<P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Settings, then click Control Panel.

<P><LI>Double-click the Add New Hardware icon, and let Windows 95 detect
   the hardware in your computer.
<P>
</OL>You can use the Debug tool in the Windows\Command folder to verify the
port settings as follows:

<OL><P><LI>At a command prompt, type the following lines, pressing ENTER after
   each line:
<P>
<P><PRE>      debug
      d 40:0
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: The first row of numbers contains the COM and LPT port I/O
   addresses. In the following example
<P>
<P><PRE>      F8 03 F8 02 00 00 00 00 - 78 03 00 00 00 00 00 f7 01
</PRE><P>
   F8 03 is COM1, F8 02 is COM2, 78 03 is LPT1, and 00 00 denotes
   that no port exists. These I/O addresses must match the I/O
   addresses in Device Manager.

<P><LI>Type "q" (without quotation marks) and press ENTER.
<P>
</OL><h3>Hard Disk Maintenance</h3>
 
<P>
There should be at least 3 megabytes (MB) of free space on the hard disk
that contains your temporary directory.
<P>
Remove Temporary and Spool Files:

<OL><P><LI>Restart your computer. Press the F8 key when you see the "Starting
   Windows 95" message, then choose "Safe mode command prompt only."
<P>
   NOTE: Windows-based applications cannot print when you start Windows
   95 in Safe mode.

<P><LI>Type "set" (without quotation marks) and press ENTER. Note the
   location of the TEMP variable.

<P><LI>Change to the directory noted in step 2. For example, if TEMP is set
   to C:\WINDOWS\TEMP, type the following line and then press ENTER:
<P>
<P><PRE>      cd\windows\temp
</PRE>
<P><LI>Delete any temporary files in this directory. Temporary files typically
   have a .TMP extension. To delete these files, type the following line
   and then press ENTER:
<P>
<P><PRE>      del *.tmp
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: You should not delete these files from within the Windows 95
   graphical user interface (GUI) because Windows 95 or a Windows-
   based application may be using one of these files.

<P><LI>Type the following line and press ENTER to change to the spool
   directory:
<P>
<P><PRE>      cd\windows\spool\printers
</PRE>
<P><LI>Delete any spool files in this directory. Spool files typically have
   a .SPL extension. To delete these files, type the following line and
   then press ENTER:
<P>
<P><PRE>      del *.spl
</PRE><P>
</OL>ScanDisk and Disk Defragmenter:
<P>
If the hard disk becomes fragmented or there are cross-linked files on
the hard disk, you can encounter printing problems. To check for these
problems, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Restart your computer normally.

<P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Programs, point to Accessories,
   point to System Tools, then click ScanDisk.

<P><LI>When ScanDisk is finished, click the Start button, point to Programs,
   point to Accessories, point to System Tools, then click Disk
   Defragmenter.
<P>
</OL><h3>You Can Print from a Command Prompt But Not Windows-Based Programs</h3>
 
<P>
If you can print from a command prompt but not from any Windows-based
application, there may be a problem with the spool settings or with
bidirectional communication.

<OL><P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Settings, then click Printers.

<P><LI>Use the right mouse button to click the printer you are trying to
   print to and then click Properties on the menu that appears.

<P><LI>Click the Details tab, click the Spool Settings button, then click
   the Print Directly To The Printer option button.

<P><LI>If your printer supports bidirectional communication, click the
   "Disable bi-directional support for this printer" option button.
<P>
   NOTE: Bidirectional printing relies on the 1284 IEEE specification. If
   your printer cable does not conform to this specification and is not
   of reasonable length, bidirectional printing does not work in Windows
   95.

<P><LI>Click the OK button.

<P><LI>Try to print from Notepad or WordPad.

<P><LI>If you can print from Notepad or WordPad, try different combinations
   of spool settings and bidirectional support until you find a combination
   that works. For example, try disabling bidirectional support with
   RAW and EMF spool data format settings. Also, try bidirectional support
   with the RAW spool data format.
<P>
   NOTE: RAW is the only spool data format supported for PostScript
   printers.
<P>
</OL><h3>Printing Problems Occur Only in One Application</h3>
 
<P>
If you can print from Notepad, WordPad, and other applications, try the
following steps:

<OL><P><LI>What exactly is the printing problem? Does the application
   print graphics properly, or are you having problems with just one
   font?

<P><LI>Does the problem occur in one document only, or all documents
   within the application? As a test, try to print a blank page inside
   the application. If this prints, the application may have problems
   with memory or fonts.

<P><LI>Are you using a 32-bit or 16-bit application? 32-bit applications
   use the system registry to obtain needed information, while 16-bit
   applications may use .INI files. If you are having a printing
   problem with a 16-bit application, perhaps an .INI file needs to
   be modified to accommodate the application.

<P><LI>Reinstall the application.

<P><LI>Contact the manufacturer of the application for specific settings
   that might affect printing.
<P>
</OL><h3>Windows 3.x Required Disabling Fast Printing Direct To Port</h3>
 
<P>
If you had to disable the Fast Printing Direct To Port option in Windows
3.1 or Windows for Workgroups 3.x, you should disable the Check Port State
option in Windows 95. To do so, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Settings, then click Printers.

<P><LI>Use the right mouse button to click the printer you want to use, then
   click Properties on the menu that appears.

<P><LI>Click the Details tab, click the Port Settings button, then click the
   Check Port Status check box to clear it.
<P>
</OL>The BIOS in some computers incorrectly reports that the printer port is
busy or not available. By default, Windows 95 checks for these errors.
Clearing the Check Port State check box causes Windows 95 to ignore these
messages.
<P>
<P><h3>Change the Printer Driver</h3>
 
<P>
Generic/Text Only:
<P>
If you have problems printing in Windows 95, try the Generic/Text Only
printer driver. To do so, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Settings, then click Printers.

<P><LI>Double-click the Add Printer icon and follow the instructions in the
   Add Printer Wizard to install the Generic/Text Only printer driver.

<P><LI>Try to print from your application with this driver.
<P>
</OL>Change the Printer's Emulation Mode:
<P>
Many printers have emulation modes that allow you to print with a different
printer driver. Refer to the printer documentation or manufacturer about
using emulation modes on your printer.
<P>
NOTE: Most printers require that you change a setting on the printer to use
emulation modes.

<OL><P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Settings, then click Printers.

<P><LI>Double-click the Add Printer icon and follow the instructions in the
   Add Printer Wizard to install the printer driver for the printer that
   your printer emulates.
<P>
   NOTE: For PostScript printers, try installing the Apple LaserWriter II
   NTX driver (this is a PostScript driver that works with most PostScript
   printers).
<P>
</OL>Windows 3.1 Printer Driver:
<P>
Windows 95 supports over 800 printers directly and can also use Windows
version 3.1 and 3.11 printer drivers. When you install Windows 95, if a
Windows 95 printer driver is available for the printer you are using, that
printer driver is installed. If there is no Windows 95 printer driver
available for your printer, the Windows 3.x printer driver is left in place
and should work with Windows 95.
<P>
NOTE: Windows 3.x printer drivers cannot take advantage of some of the
printing enhancements in Windows 95.
<P>
A newer printer driver for Windows 95 may be available in the future from
Microsoft or from your printer's manufacturer. Contact your printer's
manufacturer for further details.
<P>
For additional information about using Windows 3.1 drivers in Windows 95,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : How to Install Windows 3.1 Drivers in Windows 95

</PRE></OL>NOTE: If the printing problems exist for more than one driver, the problem
is most likely not driver-specific.
<P>
<P><h3>Remove and Reinstall the Printer Driver</h3>
 
<P>
If the printing problem seems to be corrected by using a different printer
driver, follow these steps to remove and reinstall the printer driver:

<OL><P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Settings, then click Printers.

<P><LI>Use the right mouse button to click the printer you want to remove,
   then click Delete on the menu that appears.

can cause your printer not to print at all. Follow these steps to check the
printer property settings:

<OL><P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Settings, then click Printers.

<P><LI>Use the right mouse button to click the printer you want to check, then
   click Properties on the menu that appears.

<P><LI>Verify that the printer properties (such as printer memory and paper
   size) are correct.
<P>
   NOTE: For PostScript printers, you must copy the TESTPS.TXT file to the
   printer port to determine the appropriate available printer memory
   setting for the Device Options tab. The TESTPS.TXT file lists a "Max
   Suggested VM (KB)" value for the printer. Use this value on the Device
   Options tab. See the "Print from an MS-DOS Prompt" section of this
   article for information about how to print the TESTPS.TXT file on
   PostScript printers.

      &lt;filename&gt; is the name of the file you created in step D, and
      &lt;printer port&gt; is the port the printer is attached to.

      The /b switch denotes a binary file and causes the whole file to be
      printed. Without the /b switch, the whole file may not be printed.
      The printer may stop printing the file at the first CTRL+Z character
      it encounters in the file.

</PRE><P><LI>Capture a printer port for the network printer rather than using a
   universal naming convention (UNC) connection. To do so, follow these
   steps:

   For faster RTA speed:
<P>
   a. Click "Start printing after first page is spooled."
<P>
   b. In most cases, choose EMF as the spool data format.

   b. Click "Start printing after last page is spooled." (Note that this
<P><PRE>      is how the Windows 3.1 spooler works.) In some cases, this option
      prevents laser printer engines from turning on and off during a
      print job.

</OL><h3>Try LPT1.DOS</h3>
 
<P>
If you have problems printing to a local printer, try the LPT1.DOS port.
This method is similar to printing to a file and then copying the file to
the printer port. To enable the LPT1.DOS port, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Settings, then click Printers.

<P><LI>Use the right mouse button to click the printer you want to use, then
   click Properties on the menu that appears.

<P><LI>On the Details tab, click Add Port.

<P><LI>In the Add Port dialog box, click Other, click Local Port, click OK,
   then type "LPT1.DOS" (without quotation marks) in the Enter A Port
   Name box. Click OK.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: Printing to the LPT1.DOS port may be slower than printing to the LPT1
port.
<P>
If you cannot print to LPT1.DOS in normal mode, try restarting your
computer in Safe mode, and then printing to LPT1.DOS. To start Windows 95
in Safe mode, restart the computer. When you see the "Starting Windows 95"
message, press the F8 key, and then choose Safe Mode from the Startup menu.
If you can print to LPT1.DOS in Safe mode, please see the following article
in the Microsoft Knowledge base to help you resolve this issue using Safe
mode:

</PRE></OL><h3>Additional Information</h3>
 
<P>
Try the following steps to enable the Print TrueType As Graphics option:

<OL><P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Settings, then click Printers.

<P><LI>Use the right mouse button to click the printer you want to use, then
   click Properties on the menu that appears.

<P><LI>Click the Fonts tab, then click the Print TrueType As Graphics option.
<P>
</OL>Try these steps to lower the printer's resolution:

<OL><P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Settings, then click Printers.

<P><LI>Use the right mouse button to click the printer you want to use, then
   click Properties on the menu that appears.

<P><LI>Click the Graphics tab, then click a lower resolution or dots per inch
   (DPI) for your printer.
<P>
</OL>Simplify the Document:
<P>
If you cannot print a complex document, try removing some of the graphic
elements in the document, or convert all the fonts in the document to a
printer-resident font such as Courier.
<P>
If a specific graphic object in a document is printed poorly, make sure the
graphic object is compatible with the printer. For example, an Encapsulated
PostScript (EPS) graphic object is intended for use on PostScript printers
only. On a non-PostScript printer, such a graphic object will be printed
poorly in an otherwise satisfactory printout.
<P>
Reset the Printer:
<P>
Try turning off the printer. After 5 to 10 seconds, turn the printer back
on. Many printing problems are the result of a printer's memory being full
of downloaded fonts.
<P>
Hewlett-Packard LaserJet 4:
<P>
If you print to a Hewlett-Packard LaserJet 4, change the graphics mode from
Vector to Raster. This takes less memory, and is especially useful if you
receive an "Error 21" error message on the printer.
