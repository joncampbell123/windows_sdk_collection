The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release 2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Time Zone Editor (Tzedit.exe) is available on the OEM Service Release 2
CD-ROM. You can run this tool directly from the CD-ROM by double-clicking
it in the Admin\Apptools\Tzedit folder on the CD-ROM.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Time Zone Editor was introduced as a means of quickly updating time zone
information to account for border disputes, addition and removal of time
zones, and other time zone-specific changes. Time Zone Editor has two main
functions:

<UL><LI>You can edit a time zone name or adjust the start and end dates for
   daylight saving time. Time zone information changes affect every user
   of the computer.

<LI>You can use Time Zone Editor to create new time zone entries for the
   Date/Time tool. You can have an unlimited number of time zones
   customized any way you want.
<P>
</UL>To edit a time zone:

<OL><P><LI>In Time Zone Editor, click a time zone and then click Edit.

<P><LI>Change the time zone name, abbreviation, or the difference from
   Greenwich Mean Time.
<P>
   The abbreviation is a short string name passed back to programs that
   ask for more information about the time zone. This is the Standard time
   abbreviation that applies to the Standard time zone. In the Daylight
   Saving Time box, the Abbreviation box is the Daylight abbreviation that
   applies when daylight saving time is in effect. Many communication
   programs, such as mail programs, may use this information.

<P><LI>If you want daylight saving time to be automatically enabled for the
   time zone, click Automatically Set Daylight Saving Time. Then, in the
   boxes underneath the option, fill in the start and stop days and times.
<P>
   In the Abbreviation box, type a name to apply when daylight saving time
   is in effect.
<P>
   In the Daylight Bias box, select the amount of time to move forward or
   backward from the Standard time for daylight saving time. In most
   cases, this value should stay at the default value of +1:00 hour. This
   causes the time to move forward by one hour on the daylight saving time
   start day and time and fall back one hour on the daylight saving time
   last day and time.
<P>
</OL>To create a new time zone:

<OL><P><LI>In Time Zone Editor, click New.

<P><LI>In the Time Zone Name box, type a name for the time zone to be
   displayed in the Date/Time tool.
<P>
   Time zone names should start with the general template GMT+\- 0x:00,
   and cannot exceed 63 characters. This ensures that the time zone name
   is sorted in the list box and placed in its proper order (for example,
   GMT+03:00 or  GMT-04:00).

<P><LI>In the Abbreviation box, type a name for the Standard time zone name
   abbreviation. The name should not exceed 31 characters.
<P>
   The abbreviation is a short string name passed back to programs that
   ask for more information about the time zone. This is the Standard time
   abbreviation that applies to the Standard time zone. In the Daylight
   Saving Time box, the Abbreviation box is the Daylight abbreviation that
   applies when daylight saving time is in effect. Many communication
   programs, such as mail programs, may use this information.

<P><LI>In the Offset From GMT box, select the time difference from Greenwich
   Mean Time. This value is the actual number that gets used in the data
   fields to determine the time zone's bias from Greenwich Mean Time.

<P><LI>If you want daylight saving time to be automatically enabled for the
   time zone (if the area uses daylight saving time), click the
   Automatically Set Daylight Saving Time check box to select it. Then,
   in the boxes underneath the option, fill in the start and stop days
   and times.
<P>
   The Abbreviation box is an optional entry. Type a name to apply when
   daylight saving time is in effect.
<P>
   In the Daylight Bias box, select the amount of time to move forward or
   backward from the Standard time for daylight saving time. In most
   cases, this value should stay at the default value of +1:00 hour. This
   causes the time to move forward by one hour on the daylight saving time
   start day and time and fall back one hour on the daylight saving time
   last day and time.
<P>
</OL>Changes made with Time Zone Editor affect the stored data for time zones
in the registry. If a time zone is already set on the computer, that data
is saved in another location in the registry. In order for the new
information to be used, you must use the Date/Time tool in Control Panel
and select or re-select the time zone.
