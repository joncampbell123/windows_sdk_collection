<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how to change the audio codec used to compress a
wave (.wav) sound file. An audio codec is an algorithm used to compress
and decompress sound files. If the codec used to compress a .wav file does
not provide the compression ratio or some other feature you want, you can
use the steps described in this article to change the codec used to
compress the file.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To change the audio codec used to compress a .wav file, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Programs, point to Accessories, point
   to Multimedia, and then click Sound Recorder.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Open.

<P><LI>Type the path and file name for the .wav file you want to modify in
   the File Name box, and then click Open.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Save As.

<P><LI>If you want to overwrite the original version of the file with the new
   version, click Change. If you do not want to overwrite the original
   version of the file with the new version, type a name for the new
   version in the File Name box, and then click Change.

<P><LI>Click the codec that you want to use to compress the new version of
   the file in the Format box, and then click OK.

<P><LI>Click Save.
<P>
</OL>Compressing a .wav file makes the file smaller. Because the file is
smaller, it takes less time to transfer the file across a network or
between two computers using modems. Not all audio codecs provide the same
compression ratio, which makes some audio codecs more useful than others
for a particular purpose. However, many audio codecs that provide higher
compression ratios do not provide the additional features that other audio
codecs provide (such as higher compression speeds and a greater number of
sampling rates). When you are deciding which codec to use in compressing a
.wav file, all of these factors must be taken into consideration.
<P>
For example, the Microsoft Adaptive Delta Pulse Code Modulation (ADPCM)
and Microsoft Interactive Multimedia Association (IMA) ADPCM codecs can
both achieve a 4:1 compression ratio, but the IMA ADPCM codec compresses
files faster. The Microsoft Groupe Special Mobile (GSM) 6.10 codec can
achieve only a 2:1 compression ratio, but offers a greater number of
sampling rates. The Microsoft Consultative Committee for International
Telephone and Telegraph (CCITT) G.711 A-Law and u-Law codec can also
achieve only a 2:1 compression ratio, but is best when compatibility with
current Telephony Application Programming Interface (TAPI) standards is a
concern. The DSP Group Truespeech Software codec achieves the highest
compression ratio, and is best in voice sampling applications.
<P>
Changing the attributes associated with a .wav file may cause the file to
increase or decrease in size, but does not normally make the file sound
better. In particular, compressing a .wav file or increasing the
compression ratio used on a .wav file does not usually make the file sound
better.
<P>
Note that GSM is primarily designed for the efficient compression of
speech. Using GSM to compress music an result in poor audio quality.
