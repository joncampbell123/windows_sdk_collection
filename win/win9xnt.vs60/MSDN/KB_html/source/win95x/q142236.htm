The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you try to start Windows 95 in Safe mode, you may receive the
following error message when Windows 95 is loading:
<P>
<PRE>   MSGSRV32

   An error has occurred in your program. To keep working anyway,
   click Ignore and save your work in a new file. To quit this program
   click Close. You will lose information you entered since you last
   saved.

</PRE>Clicking either Close or Ignore produces the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   MSGSRV32
   This program has performed an illegal instruction and will be shut
   down.

</PRE>Clicking Details produces the following information:
<P>
<PRE>   MSGSRV32 caused a General Protection Fault in module Rsrcmgr.dll

</PRE>Clicking Close causes the computer to stop responding (hang).
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This error can occur if QEMM 8.0 by Quarterdeck is installed and the real-
mode QEMM memory management files (Dosdata.sys and Qemm386.sys) are not
loaded in memory when Rsrcmgr.dll is loaded from the System.ini file.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To correct this situation, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Restart your computer. When you see the "Starting Windows 95" message,
   press the F8 key, and then choose Safe Mode Command Prompt Only.

<P><LI>Use any text editor (such as Edit.com) to open the System.ini file
   in the Windows folder.

<P><LI>Disable the "drivers=rsrcmgr.dll" line or the "drivers=c:\qemm\
   freemeg.dll" line in the [boot] section of the System.ini file by
   placing a semicolon (;) at the beginning of the line.

<P><LI>Add the following line below the line you disabled in step 3:
<P>
<P><PRE>      drivers=mmsystem.dll
</PRE>
<P><LI>Save and then close the System.ini file.

<P><LI>Restart your computer.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This situation can occur if QEMM 8.0 is installed on a Windows 3.x-based
computer that is later upgraded to Windows 95. The Rsrcmgr.dll file is a
resource manager file included with QEMM 8.0 for use with Windows 3.x. This
file is not for use with Windows 95. If you install QEMM 8.0 in Windows 95,
the Rsrcmgr.dll file is not loaded.
