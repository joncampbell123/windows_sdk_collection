The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After you install the Microsoft client for NetWare networks as the network
services provider, drives that are mapped and printers that are captured in
the AUTOEXEC.BAT file are no longer available.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Before you installed the Microsoft client for NetWare networks, the Novell
NetWare version 3.x or 4.x real-mode drivers were being loaded. The
Microsoft client for NetWare networks uses NWREDIR instead of NETX or VLM
as the network redirector. NWREDIR is a 32-bit protected-mode redirector
that is loaded when Windows 95 is loading.
<P>
The AUTOEXEC.BAT file is processed before NWREDIR is loaded. Since the
AUTOEXEC.BAT file is processed before network services are started, network
drives cannot be mapped and network printers cannot be captured in the
AUTOEXEC.BAT file.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Network Drives</h3>
 
<P>
Instead of mapping network drives in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file, reconnect each
network drive in Windows 95 as a persistent connection. To do so, follow
these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Start Windows Explorer.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Map Network Drive.

<P><LI>In the Drive box, click the drive letter you want for the connection.

<P><LI>In the Path box, enter the path for the network connection.

<P><LI>Click the Reconnect At Logon check box to select it.

<P><LI>Click the OK button.

<P><LI>Repeat steps 2-6 for each network drive.

<P><LI>Remove the Map commands from the AUTOEXEC.BAT file. The network
   connections will be available each time you start Windows 95.
<P>
</OL><h3>Network Printers</h3>
 
<P>
Instead of capturing network printers in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file, follow
these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Printers.

<P><LI>Double-click the Add Printer icon to start the Add Printer Wizard.

<P><LI>When you are prompted "How is this printer attached to your computer?"
   click the Network Printer option button, and then click the Next button.

<P><LI>In the Network Path Or Queue Name box, enter the correct path or
   queue name for the network printer. If you print from MS-DOS-based
   applications as well as Windows-based applications, click the
   Yes option button underneath the "Do you print from MS-DOS-based
   programs?" prompt. Click Next.

<P><LI>Click Next.

<P><LI>Click the Finish button.

<P><LI>Repeat steps 2-6 for each network printer.

<P><LI>Remove the capture commands from the AUTOEXEC.BAT file. The network
   printer connections will be available each time you start Windows 95.
