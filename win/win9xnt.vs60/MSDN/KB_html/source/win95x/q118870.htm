<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After you install the Sejin J-Mouse Keyboard drivers and restart the
system, your mouse no longer functions. The keyboard functions normally;
however, the enhanced features of the J-Mouse are not active.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The version 4.0 drivers for the J-Mouse features of the Sejin J.M.
Keyboard are not compatible with Windows 95.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
At this time, no resolution for this problem is available. Sejin is aware
of the problem and is currently working on drivers that will be compatible
with Windows 95.
<P>
Windows 95 includes a MouseKeys feature that allows users to perform mouse
actions using the numeric keypad. You can enable these features by pressing
the keyboard combination ALT+SHIFT+NUM LOCK. For more information about
MouseKeys, refer to Help.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The J-Mouse Keyboard has mouse capabilities built into the "J" key to
enable mouse movement from the keyboard. There are several other keys with
mouse functions assigned to them. These keys are designed to shorten the
transition time between the mouse and the keyboard. They also assist
individuals with movement disabilities, much the same as the accessibility
features of Windows 95.
<P>
The products included here are manufactured by Sejin America, a vendor
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise,
regarding these products' performance or reliability.
