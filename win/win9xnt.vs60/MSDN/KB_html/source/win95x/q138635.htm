<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the Full System Backup set included with Windows 95, the size
of the backup file on the floppy disk may be less than the full capacity
of the disk.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs because of the number of files being backed up and
the manner in which Microsoft Backup reserves room for the directory
listing of these files. This normally occurs when you are using more
than one hard disk, but can also occur with one hard disk if you back
up many files or folders.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this issue, create multiple backup sets to separate the data
being backed up, and then perform a backup operation for each set. For
information about performing a backup operation, see the "Using Backup to
back up your files" topic in the online Help system.
<P>
Note that this method does not back up the registry files. The Full System
Backup set backs up the registry files, and merges them back into the
registry if you restore the backup files. To back up the registry, use the
Microsoft Configuration Backup tool.
<P>
Microsoft Configuration Backup is included in the CD-ROM version of
Windows 95, but not in the floppy disk version. If you are using the
floppy disk version of Windows 95 and want to use Configuration Backup,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base for
information about the availability of Configuration Backup:

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Full System Backup set is used as an emergency recovery set in case of
complete data loss. A partial restoration of this backup should not be
performed.
