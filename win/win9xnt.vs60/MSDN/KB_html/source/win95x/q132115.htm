<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you re-install or upgrade the copy of Windows 95 on a Micro Channel
Architecture (MCA) computer, one or more installed devices may be listed
twice in Device Manager.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem can occur if you install a device manually using the Add New
Hardware Wizard before you re-install or upgrade Windows 95. During Setup,
a hardware detection routine runs to determine what devices are installed
in the computer. On MCA computers, the hardware detection routine cannot
determine which devices were already installed in Device Manager if the
devices were installed manually.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To remove a duplicate device in Device Manager, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Use the right mouse button to click My Computer, then click
   Properties on the menu that appears.

<P><LI>Click the Device Manager tab.

<P><LI>Click the device, then click Remove. Note that you may need to
   expand a branch of the hardware tree by double-clicking the branch,
   or by clicking the plus sign (+) to the left of the branch, before
   you can click the device.

<P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
</OL>To prevent this problem from occurring, install a new device manually only
if it is not automatically detected by the Add New Hardware Wizard. To use
the Add New Hardware Wizard to automatically detect and install all new
devices, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Settings, then click Control Panel.

<P><LI>Double-click the Add New Hardware icon.

<P><LI>Click Next.

<P><LI>Verify that the Yes (Recommended) option button is selected, then
   click Next.

<P><LI>Click Next.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
