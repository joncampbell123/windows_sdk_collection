   tool in Control Panel.

<P>
When you remove a modem from the Modems tool in Control Panel, the modem 
is not removed from any Dial-Up Networking connectoids that are configured
to use that modem. After you change a connectoid's modem to a modem that 
is currently installed in the Modems tool, the modem that you removed from
the Modems tool no longer appears in the connectoid's Connect Using list.
