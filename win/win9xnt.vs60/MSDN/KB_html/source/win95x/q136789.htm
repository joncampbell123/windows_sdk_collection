The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you try to uncompress a drive compressed with DriveSpace or
DoubleSpace, you may receive one of the following error messages:

<UL><LI>Windows files are installed on drive &lt;x&gt;. Uncompressing this drive
   moves its files to drive &lt;y&gt;. Because Windows refers to drive &lt;y&gt; to
   find its files, you cannot uncompress drive &lt;x&gt;.

<LI>Windows files are installed on host drive &lt;x&gt;. Uncompressing drive &lt;y&gt;
   will cause the drive letter for drive &lt;x&gt; to change. Because Windows
   refers to drive &lt;x&gt; to find its files, you cannot uncompress drive &lt;y&gt;.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
These error messages can occur for any of the following conditions:

<UL><LI>You compressed an existing drive and then installed Windows 95 on the
   compressed drive.

<LI>After you compressed a drive, you installed Windows 95 on the
   uncompressed (host) portion of the drive.

<LI>If a Windows-based program was installed on the host drive, there may
   be references to the program's components in the registry or System.ini
   file. For example, a .386 file may be referenced in the System.ini
   file.
<P>
</UL>Uncompressing a compressed drive changes the path of the Windows folder,
but the Windows folder path is not updated in the registry.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
You cannot uncompress the drive. If you want Windows 95 to be located in a
folder on a different drive, reinstall Windows 95 on that drive, and then
reinstall your programs.
<P>
NOTE: Installing Windows 95 in a new folder causes you to lose all the
Windows configuration information. Make sure to back up all the unique
data in the Windows folder before you perform this procedure.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Windows 95 registry contains many entries that refer to the path for
the Windows folder. These values are created when you install Windows 95.
If you change the path for the Windows folder by modifying its installed
drive letter, the entries become invalid.
