<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you attempt to upgrade an earlier version of Windows to Windows 95
on a drive with ample free space, you may receive the following error
message while Setup is performing a routine check of your computer:
<P>
<PRE>   Low Disk Space

   There is not enough disk space to upgrade your current version of
   Windows. However, Setup did find space for the following: a typical
   installation of Windows on a different drive. If you set up Windows
   on different drive, you will have to reinstall all of your existing
   Windows programs. Click OK to continue Setup and install the following:
   a typical installation of Windows on a different drive. Click Cancel to
   quit Setup, in which case you should free up more disk space on the
   drive that contains your existing version of Windows. Then run Setup
   again.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The PATH statement does not contain drive letters. For example:
<P>
<PRE>   SET PATH = \windows;\dos;

</PRE><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this issue, use either of the following methods:

<UL><LI>Modify the PATH statement in the Autoexec.bat file to contain drive
   letters. For example, change the statement
<P>
<P><PRE>      SET PATH = \windows;\dos;
</PRE><P>
   to:
<P>
<P><PRE>      SET PATH = c:\windows;c:\dos;
</PRE>
<LI>Disable the PATH statement in the Autoexec.bat file. To do so, place
   the word "rem" (without quotations marks) at the beginning of the PATH
   statement. For example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      REM SET PATH = \windows;\dos;
