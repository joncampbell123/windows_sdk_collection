<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how to set up a Windows-based program in the same
home folder on a computer that is configured to boot multiple versions of
Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To set up a Windows-based program on a dual-boot computer so that you can
run the program from either version of Windows and share a common folder
for the program, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Verify that the program is compatible with both operating systems.

<P><LI>Start Windows (either version) and install the program following the
   manufacturer's instructions.

<P><LI>Boot the other version of Windows. Install the program in the same
   folder as in step 2.
<P>
</OL>The installation of a Windows-based program generally involves adding
files and information to the program's folder and the Windows folder. The
Windows folder holds files that are shared with other Windows-based
programs, and links to the programs (icons) that are used to start the
programs. Programs also may write information to .ini or registry files in
the Windows folder.
<P>
If a program is installed in only one version of Windows in a dual-boot
situation, information that may be required to run the program is not
available to the version of Windows in which the program has not been
installed.
<P>
Note that when you make changes to options within a program, those changes
may not be recognized in the other version of Windows and may need to be
configured while you are running the program in the other version of
Windows. This occurs when the configuration options are contained in the
registry or in .ini files in the Windows folder.
