<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After you create a system policy for a group and define custom folders,
the custom folders may not appear when a member of the group logs on to
the network.
<P>
In addition, when a member of the group tries to connect to a Universal
Naming Convention (UNC) path, the following error message may occur:
<P>
<PRE>   The folder \\&lt;computer name&gt;\&lt;share name&gt; does not exist.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Hide Network Neighborhood option is enabled in the system policy.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Use System Policy Editor (Poledit.exe) to open the system policy file.
Click the Hide Network Neighborhood check box to clear it. This option is
located under Shell/Restrictions.
<P>
WARNING: Using System Policy Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall Windows 95. Microsoft cannot guarantee
that problems resulting from the incorrect use of System Policy Editor can
be solved. Use System Policy Editor at your own risk. System Policy Editor
is available in the Admin\Apptools\Poledit folder on the Windows 95 CD-ROM.
Use the Add/Remove Programs tool in Control Panel to install System Policy
Editor.
<P>
NOTE: Poledit.exe is included in the CD-ROM version of Windows 95, but not
in the floppy disk version. If you are using the floppy disk version of
Windows 95 and want to use Poledit.exe, please see the following article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base for information about the availability of
Poledit.exe:

   TITLE     : CD-ROM Extras for Microsoft Windows 95 Upgrade

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The ability to connect to a UNC path is the only network functionality
affected. You can still connect to the same path by mapping a drive letter
to the path. Any program that uses a UNC path will be affected.
<P>
Note that the symptoms described in this article can also occur if you
install the TweakUI PowerToy and then use TweakUI to remove the Network
Neighborhood icon from the desktop.
