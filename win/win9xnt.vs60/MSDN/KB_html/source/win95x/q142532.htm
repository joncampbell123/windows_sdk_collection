<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
You may experience any of the following symptoms:

<UL><LI>When you try to insert an object from a network location, you may 
   receive an error message similar to one of the following messages:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Word cannot obtain the data for the &lt;drive&gt;:\&lt;path&gt;\&lt;filename.ext&gt;
      link.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - Cannot insert object.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - The server application, source file, or item cannot be found.  You
      should reinstall the server application.
</PRE>
<LI>When you attempt to set the default directory for Microsoft Word 
   documents to a location on a mapped network drive, you may receive the 
   following error message:
<P>
<P><PRE>      The directory is not valid.
</PRE>
<LI>When you attempt to use Microsoft Backup to perform a backup to a 
   network drive mapped using the Microsoft Service for NetWare Directory 
   Services (MSNDS), you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Microsoft backup could not create a file on the device you want to 
      back up to. Make sure you specify a valid name for the device, and 
      that you have the necessary network access rights, and then try 
      again. For more information, contact your network administrator.
</PRE><P>
   If you attempt to connect to the share using Network Neighborhood, you 
   are able to do so.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
These errors can occur when the object you are attempting to insert
exists on a network drive mapped using the Microsoft Service for NetWare
Directory Services (MSNDS).
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, instead of using an MSNDS-mapped drive, use
the Browse button to find the network location of the object in Network
Neighborhood. This uses the Universal Naming Convention (UNC) path for the
object, rather than mapping a drive letter to the network location where
the object exists.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95. An 
update to address this problem is now available, but is not fully 
regression tested and should be applied only to computers experiencing 
this specific problem. Unless you are severely impacted by this specific 
problem, Microsoft does not recommend implementing this update at this 
time. Contact Microsoft Technical Support for additional information 
about the availability of this update.
