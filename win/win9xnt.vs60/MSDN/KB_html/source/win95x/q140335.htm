</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you are using the Internet Mail service that is included with
Microsoft Plus! and you try to use the Remote Mail feature of Microsoft
Exchange to transfer mail or update mail headers, the following error
message may be displayed:
<P>
<PRE>   You could not be logged on to mail server.

   Be sure your account information for the server is accurate. If this
   problem persists, contact your Internet Service Provider.

</PRE>This problem may occur even when the Internet mail server, account name,
and password that the Internet Mail service is configured to use are
correct. In addition, you may experience any of the following symptoms when
you attempt to transfer mail or update mail headers:

<UL><LI>Messages that you already downloaded and deleted may be downloaded
   again.

<LI>Microsoft Exchange may not download any new messages, even though you
   have new messages on the server.

<LI>Microsoft Exchange may stop responding (hang).
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
These problems can occur when you attempt to connect to your POP3 mail
server with Microsoft Exchange if you are already running a Windows sockets
program that is connected to the mail server. Microsoft Exchange does not
recognize that another program is already connected to the mail server.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Before you connect to your Internet mail server with Microsoft Exchange,
make sure that no other program is already connected to the mail server.
This includes third-party mail programs and other Internet connectivity
programs that you use in Windows 95.
