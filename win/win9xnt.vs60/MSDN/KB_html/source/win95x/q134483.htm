<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
You delete a file inside the Briefcase with the intention of breaking the
relationship between the Briefcase copy and the original file only to find
that Briefcase suggests deleting the original as well.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Briefcase default behavior is to synchronize any change made to the
file in the Briefcase with the original outside the Briefcase. If one of
these files is deleted, Briefcase assumes the copy is to be deleted as
well.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Use either of the following methods to work around this behavior:

<UL><LI>Before deleting the file in the Briefcase, select it and then click
   Split From Original on the Briefcase menu. Any subsequent changes to
   the file are ignored by Briefcase.

<LI>Delete the file in Briefcase. Click Don't Delete before updating the
   Briefcase. To use this method, follow these steps:
<P>
   1. On the Briefcase menu, click Update All.
<P>
   2. Use the right mouse button to click the file that has "Delete"
<P><PRE>      as the suggested action, and then click Don't Delete on the menu
      that appears.
</PRE><P>
   3. Repeat step 2 for any other files you do not want to delete.
<P>
   4. Click the Update button.
