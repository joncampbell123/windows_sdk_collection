<LI>Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release versions 2, 2.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you are using Briefcase or user profiles with files stored on a
Windows NT server, you may experience one of the following problems:

<UL><LI>If user profiles are enabled, the profiles are stored on a Windows NT
   server (to provide roving profiles), and the server has a very large
   number of shares, the user profile may not be downloaded from the
   server when a user logs on. The default user profile is used instead.

<LI>If Briefcase is used to synchronize with files stored on a Windows NT
   server, and the server has a very large number of shares, the
   synchronization operation may not work.

<LI>When user profiles are enabled and you try to copy a file from a
   Windows NT or NetWare server to the Briefcase, the copy operation is
   not successful. When this occurs, you may not receive an error message.
   Although you can copy files from the server to the local hard disk, you
   cannot copy to the Briefcase.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
User profiles and Briefcase use the same API set to synchronize data on a
local drive with data on the server. The network calls made result in a
list of shares on the server being returned to the client. However, if
there are too many shares on the server, the data buffer is not large
enough to contain the full list of shares. If the share on which the data
is located is not included in the partial list returned, the operation
does not work.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95. A
fix to this problem is in development, but has not been regression tested
and may be destabilizing in production environments. Microsoft does not
recommend implementing this fix at this time. Contact Microsoft Technical
Support for more information on the availability of this fix.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If this problem occurs with user profiles, the user profile cannot be
downloaded from the Windows NT server, but an updated user profile can be
saved to the Windows NT server when the user logs off. If this occurs, the
user's profile on the Windows NT server is overwritten by the changed copy
of the default profile. The previous user profile must then be restored to
the Windows NT server from a recent backup.
