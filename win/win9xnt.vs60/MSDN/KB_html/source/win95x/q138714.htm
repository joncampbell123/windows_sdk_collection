<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Windows 95 supports the Microsoft Windows Printing System, but the Windows
Printing System software is not included with Windows 95. When you install
Windows 95 on a computer that is already running the Windows Printing
System, several key Windows Printing System files are automatically
updated to newer versions. If you install the Windows Printing System
after Windows 95 is already installed on your computer, Windows 95 detects
that the Windows Printing System has been installed, and prompts you for
the Windows 95 CD-ROM or disks to update the Windows Printing System
files.
<P>
Some printers (such as the Lexmark WinWriter 400) provide the same
functionality as the Windows Printing System without having the Windows
Printing System hardware installed. These printers require third-party
software that provides the same functionality as the Windows Printing
System software. If Windows 95 detects one of these printers, and the
third-party software necessary for the printer is not installed, you are
prompted for the third-party Setup disks so that the necessary software
can be installed. You are then prompted for the Windows 95 CD-ROM or disks
so that the third-party software can be updated with the newer Windows
Printing System files that are included with Windows 95.
<P>
For a list of printers that use third-party software to provide the same
functionality as the Windows Printing System, please see the "Windows
Printing System-Compatible Printers" section later in this article.
<P>
Once Windows 95 has been installed on a computer that is running the
Windows Printing System, you may notice that some of the features of the
Windows Printing System appear to be missing, or appear to function
differently in Windows 95. This article discusses these features and how
they function in Windows 95, and provides general troubleshooting tips for
using the Windows Printing System in Windows 95.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Windows Printing System Features</h3>
 
<P>
Separator Pages:
<P>
When you use the Windows Printing System in Windows or Windows for
Workgroups 3.1 or 3.11, you can configure the printer to print a separator
page with each print job by clicking the Options button on the Windows
Printing System Setup screen, and then clicking the Header Page or Trailer
Page With Statistics check box in the Separator Pages box. In Windows 95,
these check boxes are unavailable.
<P>
For information about how to configure a printer to use a separator page
in Windows 95, view the "Separating your print jobs with a banner page"
online Help topic in Windows 95.
<P>
NOTE: Both the Full and Simple separator pages that are included with
Windows 95 are header pages that are printed before each print job. You
cannot configure a printer to use a trailer page that is printed after
each print job in Windows 95.
<P>
Printing to a Network Printer:
<P>
To reliably print to a Windows Printing System printer that is not
attached directly to your computer in Windows 95, you should capture a
printer port and print to that captured port, instead of printing directly
to a Universal Naming Convention (UNC) share name.
<P>
For information about how to capture a printer port in Windows 95, view
the "Capturing A Printer Port" online Help topic in Windows 95.

<P><h3>Windows Printing System Troubleshooting</h3>
 
<P>
If incorrect characters are printed at the top of the first page, followed
by several blank pages, when you attempt to print to a local Windows
Printing System printer, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

               Characters

</PRE>For information about troubleshooting printing problems in Windows 95,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : Troubleshooting Printing Problems in Windows 95

</PRE>If you are having a problem with the Windows Printing System in Windows
95, and the information in this article does not help you resolve the
problem, you should remove the Windows Printing System, and then reinstall
it. To do so, double-click the Printers folder in Control Panel, and then
remove the Windows Printing System printer. After removing the printer
from the Printers folder, rename the following files in the Windows\System
folder:

<UL><LI>Wps_updt.dll
<LI>Wpsmon.dll
<LI>Wpsmon16.dll
<P>
</UL>After you rename or delete these files, reinstall the Windows Printing
System from the Windows Printing System Setup disks. When you do, Windows
95 detects that the Windows Printing System has been installed, and prompt
you for the Windows 95 CD-ROM or disks to update the Windows Printing
System files.
<P>
<P><h3>Windows Printing System-Compatible Printers</h3>
 
<P>
Windows 95 detects third-party Windows Printing System software for the
following printers:

<UL><LI>Canon LBP-430W
<LI>Epson ActionLaser 1300/W
<LI>Epson EPL-5500/W
<LI>Lexmark WinWriter 100
<LI>Lexmark WinWriter 200
<LI>Lexmark WinWriter 400
<LI>Lexmark WinWriter 600
<LI>NEC SuperScript Color 3000
<LI>Olivetti PG304
<LI>Samsung MyLaser-4
<LI>Samsung MyLaser-5
<LI>Samsung MyLaser-6
<P>
</UL>The troubleshooting steps in the previous section also apply to these
printers. Support for these printers is provided by the manufacturer of
the printer.
<P>
The third-party products discussed in this article are manufactured by
vendors independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or
otherwise, regarding these products' performance or reliability.
