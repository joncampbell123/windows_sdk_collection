<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has released the Dial-Up Networking 1.2 Upgrade.
<P>
This upgrade provides additional features for the Dial-Up Networking 
(DUN) support that was first delivered in Windows 95. It includes all of 
the features of the first upgrade, widely known as the ISDN Accelerator 
Pack for Windows 95, including support for internal ISDN adapters, 
multilink support for two ISDN channels, and connection-time scripting 
to automate non-standard login connections. In addition to the features 
of the first upgrade, this upgrade also delivers PPTP client capability 
for Windows 95.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Windows 95 Dial-Up Networking 1.2 Upgrade replaces all of the Dial-
Up Networking components, and installs new versions of the TCP/IP stack 
and the NDIS layer. A new version of Winsock is included as an optional 
component in order to correct name resolution limitations in the 
original Windows 95 software. 
<P>
The Dial-Up Networking 1.2 Upgrade can be applied to existing Window 95-
based computers, including the retail release and OEM Service Release 2 
(OSR2). 
<P>
The Dial-Up Networking 1.2 Upgrade is bundled into a self-installing 
file called Msdun12.exe. After you run the Msdun12.exe file, all of the 
Dial-Up Networking system components are installed in their proper 
folders. 
<P>
To obtain the Windows 95 Dial-Up Networking 1.2 Upgrade, visit the 
following Microsoft Web site:
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/getisdn/dload.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/getisdn/dload.htm</A></B>

</PRE><h3>ISDN Information</h3>
 
<P>
Because Windows 95 does not have the ability to recognize ISDN hardware 
without the Windows 95 Dial-Up Networking 1.2 Upgrade, we strongly 
recommend that you install Dial-Up Networking 1.2 before installing ISDN 
hardware in your computer.  
<P>
Before installing the ISDN adapter and drivers, you must make sure that 
the adapter is ISDN 1.1-compatible and that the drivers you are 
installing are ISDN 1.1-compliant. Dial-Up Networking 1.2 does not work 
with version 1.0 ISDN drivers. For a list of certified Windows 95-
compatible ISDN 1.1 adapter drivers available for download, see the 
Windows 95 Hardware Compatibility List (HCL). The HCL can be found on 
the Microsoft Windows Hardware Quality Labs Web site at: 
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/hwtest/">http://www.microsoft.com/hwtest/</A></B> 

</PRE>Other things to take into consideration before installing your ISDN
adapter driver are:

<UL><LI>An ISDN line must be installed.

<LI>You must know your switch type, SPIDs, and phone numbers from your
   telephone company. If you do not have this information, get it from
   your telephone company before continuing.

<LI>You must be running the released version of Windows 95 or OEM Service
   Release 2 (OSR2).
<P>
</UL><h3>Multilink Information</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft Windows 95 Dial-Up Networking 1.2 includes updates to support 
the combining of two 64-kbps data channels into the equivalent of a 
single 128-kbps line. The technique of combining multiple lines together 
into a single dial-up connection is known by several names including 
"multilink," "dual-channel access," and the more technical terms "MLPPP" 
and "PPP Multilink."
<P>
Multilink is available when you have more than one dial-up device (such 
as two "B" channels of an ISDN connection). If you have only one dial-up 
device configured, you are not able to use multilink. Multilink depends 
upon the capabilities of the service or corporate network that you are 
dialing into in order to function properly. To use multilink, the 
answering Internet service provider, online service, or corporate LAN 
must provide multilink support.
<P>
Configuring Multilink:
<P>
To configure multilink support in Windows 95, double-click My Computer 
on the Windows 95 desktop, and then double-click the Dial-Up Networking 
(DUN) folder. The DUN folder displays an icon labeled Make New 
Connection, plus icons for each of the connections that you have already 
created. If you have not yet created a connection, double-click Make New 
Connection to define a connection to the appropriate dial-up service.
<P>
After you have created a connectoid, follow these steps to configure the 
connectoid for multilinking:

<OL><P><LI>Right-click the connectoid, and then click Properties.

<P><LI>Click the Multilink tab, and then click Use Additional Devices.

<P><LI>Click Add, and then specify the devices to bundle together to form
   the multilink connection.
<P>
</OL>Use the Add, Remove, and Edit buttons to change the list of additional 
devices. You can enter a different phone number for each device, and 
both phone numbers are stored. If you subsequently change the phone 
number for the connection icon, the phone numbers associated with 
additional devices on this page do not change.
<P>
Multilink Operation:
<P>
After your additional devices are configured using the procedure 
outlined above, you are ready to dial your multilink connection. When 
you dial the connection, Dial-Up Networking dials the primary number of 
the primary device specified for the connection. Once the first 
connection is established, Dial-Up Networking dials the other devices 
specified in the Additional Devices list.
<P>
Once the connections are established, you can view status information 
about the link by double-clicking the Communicating Computers icon on 
the taskbar, or you can disconnect the connection.
<P>
The status information includes the number of bytes sent and received, 
the network protocols negotiated for use on the connection, and a box 
showing each of the additional devices. When you click a device in the 
box, a Suspend or Resume button is displayed. If a Suspend button is 
displayed, the device is in use and "bundled" into the multilink 
connection. Clicking Suspend disconnects that line and removes the line 
from the bundled connections.
<P>
If the Resume button is displayed, click Resume to dial that connection 
and add that line to the bundle. You can suspend and resume individual 
links without dropping the connection.
<P>
<P><h3>PPTP Information</h3>
 
<P>
Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) for Windows 95 is another 
component of the Dial-Up Networking 1.2 Upgrade. The PPTP client allows 
a Windows 95-based computer to establish a secure connection across the 
Internet to a private network, creating a Virtual Private Network (VPN). 
This can be used to minimize communications costs for organizations 
whose employees need to access the corporate network from remote 
locations. PPTP can also be used as a method to allow selected users to 
access a private network that is separated from the general corporate 
LAN by a tunnel server. 
<P>
All data sent over a PPTP connection can be encrypted and compressed, 
and multiple network level protocols (TCP/IP, NetBEUI, and IPX) can be 
run concurrently. Windows NT Server Domain Login-level security is 
preserved even across the Internet. 
<P>
NOTE: In order for PPTP to work on a client, you must provide and 
configure a PPTP server (such as a Windows NT server) with one port on 
the Internet and one port on the private network. In addition to the 
Dial-Up Networking 1.2 Upgrade, you must install the protocol required 
by the private network on each Windows 95 client. (If the private 
network is running IP, no action is required. If the private network 
runs IPX or NetBEUI, each Windows 95 client must also support this 
protocol.)
