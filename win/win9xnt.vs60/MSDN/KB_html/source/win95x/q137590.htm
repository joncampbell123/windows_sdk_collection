<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use Device Manager to check the status of an IDE hard disk
controller with no attached devices, you may see an exclamation point in a
yellow circle to the left of the controller. However, if you view the
controller's properties, Device Manager reports that the device is present
and that there are no problems.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may occur with any IDE controller that does not have a device
attached to it.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, use any one of the following methods:

<UL><LI>Use Device Manager to disable the IDE controller that has no devices
   attached to it. To do so, follow these steps:
<P>
   1. In Control Panel, double-click the System icon.
<P>
   2. Click the Device Manager tab.
<P>
   3. Double-click the Hard Disk Controllers branch to expand it, and
<P><PRE>      then double-click the IDE controller.
</PRE><P>
   4. Click the Original Configuration (Current) check box to clear it,
<P><PRE>      and then click OK.
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: This procedure causes a red X to appear to the left of the
   controller in Device Manager, indicating that the device is present, but
   is currently disabled. If the device is Plug and Play compatible,
   disabling the device in this manner allows the resources that are
   normally allocated to the device to be used for another device. If the
   device is not Plug and Play compatible, you may need to physically
   remove the device from your computer to free the resources that are
   allocated to it. To see if the resources have been freed after disabling
   the device, click the device in Device Manager, click Properties, and
   then click the Resources tab.
<P>
   After you use this procedure to disable the device in Device Manager,
   you must also disable it using your computer's CMOS Setup program. For
   information on how to do so, consult the documentation that came with
   your computer, or contact the computer manufacturer.

<LI>Check to make sure that the IDE controller is enabled using your
   computer's CMOS Setup program, and then physically attach a device to
   the controller.

<LI>If you do not intend to use the IDE controller, physically remove it
   from your computer.
<P>
   NOTE: This is a viable, but unnecessary, solution to this problem.
   Disabling the controller in Device Manager prevents any resources from
   being allocated to the controller, and makes it much easier for you to
   reinstall the controller if you decide to use it later.
