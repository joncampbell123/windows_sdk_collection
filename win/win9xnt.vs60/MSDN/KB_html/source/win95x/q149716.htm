The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After you add new hardware on a docking station with the Add New Hardware
Wizard, Windows 95 may become unstable or generate hardware-oriented error
messages when the computer is undocked.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior can occur if Windows 95 has installed the new hardware in
all configurations (both docked and undocked).
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Use either method:

<UL><LI>If the hardware was added in the docked state and the hardware is not
   present in the undocked state, remove the device in Device Manager. If
   the hardware was added in the undocked state, remove the device from
   the docked configuration.
<P>
   NOTE: Disabling the device in the unwanted configuration in Device
   Manager may not resolve the conflicts. Be sure to click the missing
   device and click Remove, and then confirm which hardware profile you
   want to modify.

<LI>Boot the computer in the docked configuration first. Run the Add New
   Hardware Wizard, and allow it to detect the devices. Then, boot in the
   undocked configuration, and run the Add New Hardware Wizard again.
<P>
   Windows 95 will detect that the device is not present in the alternate
   configuration and prompt you to remove the device from that
   configuration.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95. We
are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
