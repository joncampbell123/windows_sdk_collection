The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
<LI>Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you are compressing a drive using DriveSpace or DriveSpace 3, you
may receive one of the following error messages when the operation is 25
percent complete:

<UL><LI>The MINI.CAB file is missing or damaged. Copy the file from
   your Windows (or Plus!) Setup disk to your Windows\system directory,
   and then try again.
<P>
   ID Number:  DRVSPACE331

<LI>Windows cannot create the C:\FAILSAFE\FAILSAFE.DRV\W31SPACE.EXE
   file. There might not be enough free space on drive C, the
   root directory of drive C may be full, or the disk may be
   write-protected.
<P>
   ID Number:  DRVSPACE125
<P>
</UL>Either of these error messages is followed by the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Windows might not be able to restart this task if it is interrupted.
   You may need as much as 1.5 MB of free space to continue.

   ID Number:  DRVSPACE311

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
These error messages can occur if you are running IBM AntiVirus for
Windows 95 with certain virus protection features enabled.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Run the IBM AntiVirus program and disable the following options in System
Shield (located under the Setup menu item):

<UL><LI>Warn When Viral Activity Occurs

<LI>Check Files When Opened
<P>
</UL>NOTE: Both options must be disabled in order to complete the compression
operation.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When the two options listed above are enabled, IBM AntiVirus also affects
your ability to create a Startup disk from the Add/Remove Programs tool in
Control Panel, and may cause problems with some self-extracting
installation programs. When these problems occur, you may receive the
following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   File Copying Problem
   Setup had trouble copying a file. Click OK to try copying
   the file again. If this message reappears, quit Setup and
   then try running Setup again."

</PRE>To resolve these problems, use the instructions in the "Resolution"
section of this article.
