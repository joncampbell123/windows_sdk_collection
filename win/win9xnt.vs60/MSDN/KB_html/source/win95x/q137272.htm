</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you try to install Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95 using a 3.5-inch
standard (non-DMF) 1.44-MB disk set, you may receive the following error
message when Setup reaches eight percent complete:
<P>
<PRE>   The compressed file '&lt;drive&gt;:\plus_1.CAB' cannot be decompressed and
   may be corrupted.

</PRE>After Setup closes and you restart the computer, you may receive the
following error message when you try to perform a DriveSpace operation:
<P>
<PRE>   The compression driver that is currently loaded is incompatible with
   your version of Windows compression.
   ID Number: DRVSPACE484

</PRE>In addition, you may receive "Out of memory" error messages if your
Windows swap file is located on a compressed drive, and the Disk
Compression status line on the Performance tab in System properties may
report that compressed drives are being access in MS-DOS Compatibility
mode.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The cabinet (.cab) file located on disk 1 is damaged. The disk sets known
to have this problem have a disk assembly number of 320-051-013. The disk
assembly number is located in the lower right corner of the disk, above
the words "All rights reserved."
<P>
The damaged cabinet file prevents Setup from copying the protected-mode
DriveSpace 3 driver (Drvspacx.vxd) to the hard disk, and causes Setup to
fail. When you restart your computer, the real-mode DriveSpace 3 driver is
loaded, causing your compressed drives to use MS-DOS Compatibility mode.
This driver is incompatible with the Windows 95 version of DriveSpace that
is currently installed, preventing you from running DriveSpace in Windows
95.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Remove the Program Files\Plus! folder that was created by Setup, and then
reinstall Microsoft Plus from a CD-ROM, a 3.5-inch DMF disk set, or a 3.5-
inch standard (non-DMF) disk set that does not have this problem. To
obtain a replacement non-DMF disk set that does not have this problem,
please contact Microsoft Product Support.
<P>
If you are using DriveSpace and you cannot reinstall Microsoft Plus! from
a CD-ROM, a 3.5-inch DMF disk set, or a 3.5-inch standard (non-DMF) disk
set that does not have this problem right away, restore the Windows 95
DriveSpace files that were replaced by Microsoft Plus! Setup before you
use Windows 95. To do so, start your computer at a command prompt, change
to the drive containing Windows 95, and type the following commands. Press
ENTER after each command.
<P>
NOTE: These commands assume that your Windows folder is named Windows. If
your Windows folder is named something else, substitute the name of your
Windows folder in the following commands.
<P>
<PRE>   cd \windows\command
   copy drvbin.w95 drvspace.bin /y
   copy dblbin.w95 dblspace.bin /y
   copy drvsys.w95 drvspace.sys /y
   copy dblsys.w95 dblspace.sys /y
   cd \windows\system\iosubsys
   copy drvvxd.w95 drvspacx.vxd /y
   cd\
   attrib *.w95 -s -h -r
   attrib *.bin -s -h -r
   copy drvbin.w95 drvspace.bin /y
   copy dblbin.w95 dblspace.bin /y

</PRE>NOTE: Depending on the version of MS-DOS or Windows that was originally
used to compress your drive, some of the .w95 files referenced in the
above commands may not exist. If you receive a "File not found" error
message after typing one of the above commands, try typing the command
again to see if you typed it correctly. If you receive the same error
message again, move on to the next command.
<P>
If the drive that contains the Windows folder is not also the physical
boot drive, change to the physical boot drive and type the following
commands. Press ENTER after each command:
<P>
<PRE>   cd\
   attrib *.w95 -s -h -r
   attrib *.bin -s -h -r
   copy drvbin.w95 drvspace.bin /y
   copy dblbin.w95 dblspace.bin /y

</PRE>After you type these commands, restart your computer.
