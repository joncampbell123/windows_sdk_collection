The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release versions 2, 2.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you are running Windows 95 on a computer with CardBus slots, you may 
experience the following symptoms:

<UL><LI>When multiple PC Cards are installed and the computer is started,
   Windows may not start and you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<P><PRE>      While initializing ... device V86MMGR: Insufficient memory 
      to initialize Windows.
</PRE>
<LI>If Windows is running with one PC Card inserted, the computer may 
   become unresponsive for several minutes when you insert another PC
   Card. When the computer returns from this busy state, Device Manager
   Reports the new card as disabled because of a resource conflict (code
   12).
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
These symptoms can occur if there are not enough available IRQ lines for
all the installed devices.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this issue, make more IRQ resources available by disabling
a device (such as a COM port or LPT port). Such devices can typically be 
disabled in Device Manager.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95 OEM 
Service Release 2 (OSR2). An update to address this problem is now 
available, but is not fully regression tested and should be applied only 
to computers experiencing this specific problem. Unless you are severely 
impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft does not recommend 
implementing this update at this time. Contact the vendor of your OEM 
version of Windows to obtain this update, or contact Microsoft Technical 
Support for additional information about the availability of this update.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If there are not enough available IRQ lines, there is no configuration 
that allows all devices to be active without a resource conflict. A device
must be removed or disabled to free an IRQ line and allow the remaining 
devices to be configured successfully.
<P>
The update causes Windows to more quickly recognize that it cannot resolve
the resource conflict. The new device is disabled as before, but more 
quickly.
<P>
Note that these symptoms may appear more readily with certain specific 
PC Card devices that use more than one IRQ line or cannot share IRQ lines
with other devices.
