The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you add the line "BootMulti=1" to the [Options] section of the
Msdos.sys file and then try to boot to the previous version of MS-DOS on
the computer, Windows 95 may start normally instead.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior can occur if Norton AntiVirus for Windows 95 version 1.0
is installed on the computer. AntiVirus may overwrite the MS-DOS
versions of the Command.com, Io.sys, Msdos.sys, Autoexec.bat, and
Config.sys files with its own version of these files. AntiVirus
inoculates the Io.sys and Msdos.sys files by default. However, other
files may have been added to the inoculation list by earlier versions of
AntiVirus.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this behavior, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Remove the Master Boot Record (MBR) and the Io.sys, Msdos.sys,
   Command.com, Autoexec.bat, and Config.sys files from the AntiVirus
   inoculation list using Norton AntiVirus for Windows 95.

<P><LI>Start your computer with the MS-DOS version 6.x Upgrade Disk 1 in
   drive A. Type the following lines at the command prompt:
<P>
<P><PRE>      a:\attrib c:\msdos.sys -s -h -r
      copy c:\msdos.sys c:\msdos.xxx
      a:\sys a: c:
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: If drive C is compressed and is currently mounted, you need to
   use the SYS command to make the host drive for drive C bootable as
   well.

<P><LI>Type the following lines at the command prompt:
<P>
<P><PRE>      a:\attrib c:\io.sys -s -h -r
      a:\attrib c:\msdos.sys -s -h -r
      a:\attrib c:\io.dos -s -h -r
      a:\attrib c:\msdos.dos -s -h -r
      del c:\io.dos
      del c:\msdos.dos
      copy c:\io.sys c:\io.dos
      copy c:\msdos.sys c:\msdos.dos
</PRE>
<P><LI>Restart your computer using the Windows 95 Startup Disk, and then
   type the following line at the command prompt:
<P>
<P><PRE>      a:\sys a: c:
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: If drive C is compressed and is currently mounted, you need to
   use the SYS command to make the host drive for drive C bootable as
   well.

<P><LI>Type the following lines at the command prompt:
<P>
<P><PRE>      a:\attrib c:\msdos.sys -s -h -r
      copy c:\msdos.xxx c:\msdos.sys
</PRE>
<P><LI>Restart your computer.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Norton AntiVirus for Windows 95 version 1.0 makes a backup copy of
system configuration, system, and other files on the inoculation list.
By default, these files are stored in the C:\Ncdtree folder. When the
computer starts, the command "c:\progra~1\norton~1\navboot.exe" in the
Autoexec.bat file is carried out. Navboot.exe compares the backup files
in the C:\Ndtree folder with the files that are in use to determine if
they have changed.
<P>
If AntiVirus senses that a change has been made to these files or that
an attempt was made to write to the MBR, it displays a virus warning
message and prompts you to inoculate, repair, or continue. If you choose
to repair, AntiVirus reverses the changes by restoring from the backup
files. If you choose to inoculate, the program updates the backup files
to the new versions. If you choose continue, nothing is done and the
warning message appears again during the next boot.
<P>
The problem usually occurs when Norton AntiVirus 3.0 was installed prior
to installing Norton AntiVirus for Windows 95. Both programs use the
same folder to store inoculated files and data. By default, AntiVirus
3.0 makes a backup of the Command.com file (and other system files) in
the C:\Ncdtree folder where Norton AntiVirus for Windows 95 later finds
it.
