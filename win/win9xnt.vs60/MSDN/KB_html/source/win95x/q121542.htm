The information in this article applies to:

<P>
IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, you should first make a backup copy of the
registry files (System.dat and User.dat). Both are hidden files in the
Windows folder.
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article lists the steps necessary to install an NDIS 2 network
interface card (NIC) driver that is not listed as a choice in the Select
Device dialog box and does not have an Oemsetup.inf file. If you have any
questions regarding these steps, consult the manufacturer of your network
card.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To complete these steps, you must first have the NDIS 2 network card
driver. If Microsoft does not provide a driver for your card, contact the
card manufacturer.

<OL><P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click
   Control Panel.

<P><LI>Double-click the Network icon.

<P><LI>Click Add, click Adapter, then click Add.

<P><LI>Insert the manufacturer-supplied driver disk, and click the Have Disk
   button.

<P><LI>Select the correct NDIS 2 driver, click OK, click the driver in the
   list of installed network components, and click Properties.
<P>
   NOTE: If the driver cannot be found, browse in the NDIS or LanMan
   folders and look for files with a .dos extension.

<P><LI>Click the Driver Type tab, click "Real mode (16-bit) NDIS driver,"
   then click OK.

<P><LI>After you click OK a second time, you are prompted with the following
   message:
<P>
<P><PRE>     Please shut down and restart the computer for your changes to
     take effect.
</PRE><P>
   Click OK a third time, but do not restart your system.
<P>
</OL>After you complete the above steps, a Protocol.ini file is created in your
Windows 95 directory. The configuration settings (IRQ, I/O address, and so
on) for your network card must be manually set in this Protocol.ini file.
The Protocol.ini file that is created contains the following blank
section:
<P>
<PRE>   []
   DriverName=

</PRE></OL>To successfully use the network, you must manually insert the proper
section heading, driver name, and any other necessary lines to configure
your network card (such as the IRQ, I/O address, and so on). An example
for an Intel EtherExpress 16 set for real mode is:
<P>
<PRE>   [EXP16$]
   DriverName=EXP16$
   transceiver=Twisted-Pair (TPE)
   iochrdy=Late
   ioaddress=0x300
   irq=10

</PRE>After you fill out the Protocol.ini file, you must add the name of the
network card driver (&lt;DriverName&gt;.DOS) to the registry. To add the driver
name to the registry, add the string value
<P>
<PRE>   netcard

</PRE>to the following entry in the registry:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\
   Network\Real Mode Net

</PRE>Set the new value to your network card driver name (with the .DOS
extension).
<P>
For example, for the Intel EtherExpress card, the value is:
<P>
<PRE>   exp16.dos

</PRE>NOTE: For information about how to edit the registry, view the Changing
Keys And Values online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Note
that you should make a backup copy of the registry files (System.dat and
User.dat) before you edit the registry.
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall Windows 95. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved.
Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
Finally, make sure the Autoexec.bat file contains the command NET START.
This line (C:\WINDOWS\NET START) loads the NDIS 2 network card driver and
protocol drivers, then it binds them together.
