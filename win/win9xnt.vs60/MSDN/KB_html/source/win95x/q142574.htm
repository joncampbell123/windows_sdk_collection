The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how to install and use the Briefcase tool that is
included with Windows 95.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Briefcase helps keep your files updated when you use two computers by
automatically synchronizing multiple copies of individual files. For
example, if you use a desktop computer at home, and a laptop computer on
the road, you can use Briefcase to synchronize the files that you work with
both at home and on the road. Because Briefcase automatically keeps track
of the relationships between multiple copies of a single file, you do not
need to remember where each copy of a file is located, or which copy of the
file you modified most recently.
<P>
<P><h3>Installing Briefcase</h3>
 
<P>
The Windows 95 Setup program automatically installs Briefcase if you
choose the Portable Setup option, or if you choose the Custom Setup option
and specify that Briefcase should be installed. If you do not install
Briefcase during Setup and decide later that you want it, you must
reinstall Windows 95.
<P>
Note that if you are using Windows 95 OEM Service Release 2 (OSR2) or
later, it is not necessary to reinstall Windows 95 to install Briefcase
after Setup. To install Briefcase, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then double-
   click Add/Remove Programs.

<P><LI>Click Accessories, and then click Details.

<P><LI>Click the Briefcase checkbox to select it, click OK, and then click OK 
   again.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: If you remove the Briefcase icon from the desktop, use the right
mouse button to click the desktop, point to New, and then click Briefcase
to create a new Briefcase icon.
<P>
<P><h3>Using Briefcase to Keep Files Synchronized</h3>
 
<P>
Keeping Files Synchronized Using a Floppy Disk:

<OL><P><LI>Insert a disk into a floppy disk drive in your primary computer.

<P><LI>Copy the files that you want to work with to Briefcase. You can also
   copy a folder to Briefcase, if you want to work with all the files in
   that folder. To copy files or folders to Briefcase, you can drag the
   files or folders to the My Briefcase icon on the desktop.

<P><LI>Move Briefcase to the floppy disk.

<P><LI>Insert the disk containing Briefcase into a floppy disk drive in your
   secondary computer, and then edit the files in Briefcase.

<P><LI>When you are ready to synchronize the files, insert the disk containing
   Briefcase into a disk drive in your primary computer, and then double-
   click the My Briefcase icon on the floppy disk.

<P><LI>To update all the files in Briefcase, click Briefcase, and then click
   Update All. To update only certain files, click the files you want to
   update, click Briefcase, and then click Update Selection.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: You can also use the following method to keep files synchronized
using a floppy disk. Because the above method uses a single Briefcase and
maintains fewer copies of the files you want to work with, it is
preferred. However, the following method does not require you to edit
files stored on a floppy disk and may be faster.

<OL><P><LI>Insert a disk into a floppy disk drive in your primary computer.

<P><LI>Move the files that you want to work with from the hard disk to the
   floppy disk, or create new files on the floppy disk. You can also move
   a folder to the floppy disk, if you want to work with all the files in
   that folder.

<P><LI>Copy the files that you want to work with from the floppy disk to the
   Briefcase on your primary computer. You can also copy a folder to
   Briefcase, if you want to work with all the files in that folder. To
   copy files or folders to Briefcase, you can drag the files or folders
   to the My Briefcase icon on the desktop.

<P><LI>Insert the disk containing the files you want to work with into a
   floppy disk drive in your secondary computer, and then copy the files
   from the floppy disk to the Briefcase on your secondary computer.

<P><LI>Edit the files in Briefcase, and then synchronize the files. To update
   all the files in Briefcase, click Briefcase, and then click Update All.
   To update only certain files, click the files you want to update, click
   Briefcase, and then click Update Selection.

<P><LI>Insert the disk containing the files you want to work with into a
   floppy disk drive in your primary computer, and then synchronize the
   files.
<P>
</OL>Keeping Files Synchronized on Connected Computers:

<OL><P><LI>On your secondary computer, copy the files that you want to work with
   from your primary computer to Briefcase. To copy the files from your
   primary computer, you must first share the folders that contain those
   files. You can also copy shared folders to Briefcase, if you want to
   work with all the files in that folder. To copy files or folders to
   Briefcase, you can drag the files or folders to the My Briefcase icon
   on the desktop.

<P><LI>Edit the files in Briefcase on your secondary computer. The computers
   do not need to be connected while you are editing the files.

<P><LI>When you are ready to synchronize the files, connect the two computers,
   and then double-click the My Briefcase icon on your secondary computer.

<P><LI>To update all the files in Briefcase, click Briefcase, and then click
   Update All. To update only certain files, click the files you want to
   update, click Briefcase, and then click Update Selection.
<P>
</OL><h3>Helpful Tips</h3>
 

<UL><LI>When you synchronize files using a floppy disk, do not copy Briefcase to
   the floppy disk. When you copy Briefcase to the floppy disk instead of
   moving it, you create multiple copies of Briefcase. If you create
   multiple copies of Briefcase, you may not know which copy of Briefcase
   to use when you want to synchronize your files.

<LI>When you synchronize files using a floppy disk, the total size of all
   the files cannot be greater than 1.44 MB. When you move a Briefcase that
   is larger than 1.44 MB to floppy disks, the files that are copied to the
   second and subsequent disks are not maintained as belonging to the
   Briefcase on the first disk. For more information about this problem,
   please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../win95x/q130076.htm">Q130076</A></B>
<PRE></PRE>      TITLE     : Briefcase Cannot Contain More Than 1.44 MB

</PRE><LI>When you are editing the files from Briefcase on your secondary
   computer, do not move the files out of Briefcase. If you move a file
   out of Briefcase and then edit the file, the file will not be properly
   updated when you attempt to synchronize the files in Briefcase.

<LI>After you copy files to Briefcase, do not move the original files on the
   primary computer. Briefcase keeps track of the original location of all
   the files that you copy to Briefcase, but it is not able to track the
   files if you move them to a different location. Once you move a file on
   the primary computer, the file is no longer associated with the copy of
   the file in Briefcase, even if you move the file back to its original
   location.
<P>
   If this problem occurs and Briefcase is unable to synchronize the
   files, you may be able to manually synchronize the files instead. To
   do so, you must first decide if you want to use the original file, or
   the copy of the file in Briefcase. If you want to use the original
   file, you can synchronize the files by deleting the copy of the file
   in Briefcase, and then copying the original file to Briefcase. If you
   want to use the copy of the file in Briefcase, move the file from
   Briefcase to a new location on your hard disk, and then copy the file
   to Briefcase.
