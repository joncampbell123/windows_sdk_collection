                             ================

</PRE></UL><h2>Using Both Real- and Protected-Mode Drivers</h2>
 
<P>
If you use a real-mode driver for a PCMCIA (PC Card) device such as a
CD-ROM drive, your PCMCIA card socket and any other PCMCIA card devices
must also use real-mode drivers in Windows 95. Windows 95 does not support
the use of real- and protected-mode PCMCIA card devices or socket drivers
simultaneously. This combination may cause unpredictable results.
<P>
<P><h2>Troubleshooting PCMCIA Cards</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Real Mode</h3>
 
<P>
Before you install Windows 95, make certain your PCMCIA card device works
in real mode. If you have already installed Windows 95, but you have not
run the 32-bit PCMCIA Card Socket Wizard, restart Windows 95 at a command
prompt. To do so, press the F8 key when you see the "Starting Windows 95"
message, and then choose Command Prompt Only from the Startup menu. If your
PCMCIA card works in real mode, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Restart Windows 95 normally.

<P><LI>Use the right mouse button to click My Computer, and then click
   Properties on the menu that appears.

<P><LI>On the Device Manager tab, double-click the device icon, click the
   PCMCIA device, and then click Remove.

<P><LI>Restart your computer.

<P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and
   then double-click the Add New Hardware icon.

<P><LI>Follow the Add New Hardware Wizard instructions to re-detect your
   hardware device.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: Some devices do not appear in Device Manager if real-mode socket
services are running (for example, CD-ROM drives). If your device does not
appear in Device Manager, please contact your hardware manufacturer for
further information.
<P>
If you use real-mode drivers for your PCMCIA card and you change its
resources in Device Manager, the change does not take effect. These
resources must be changed with the real-mode drivers and utilities. If you
have any questions about these drivers and utilities, please contact your
hardware manufacturer.
<P>
If your PCMCIA card device does not work in real mode, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Restart your computer with your earlier version of MS-DOS. For
   information about this process, please see the following articles
   in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../win95x/q121963.htm">Q121963</A></B>
<PRE></PRE>      TITLE     : Requirements to Boot Previous Operating System

      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../zmiscellaneous/q118579.htm">Q118579</A></B>
      TITLE     : Contents of the Windows Msdos.sys File

</PRE><P><LI>Test your PCMCIA card.
<P>
</OL>If your PCMCIA card does not work in this configuration, please contact
your hardware manufacturer for further information.
<P>
If your PCMCIA card does work, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Start your computer by stepping through the startup files. To do this,
   press the F8 key when you see the "Starting Windows 95" message, and
   then choose Step-By-Step Confirmation from the Startup menu.

<P><LI>Answer "Yes" to all prompts except:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Choose "No" when you are prompted "Process the system registry?"
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - Choose "No" when you are prompted "Load the Windows graphical user
      interface?"
</PRE><P>
</OL>If your PCMCIA card still does not work, try the device on another computer
if possible, and contact your hardware manufacturer.
<P>
<P><h3>Protected-Mode</h3>
 
<P>
To use a PCMCIA card device in protected mode, the device must be supported
by Windows 95 or the vendor must supply a Windows 95 driver.
<P>
Before you attempt to use your PCMCIA card device in protected mode, you
must first enable the protected-mode socket services. To enable these
services, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>In Control Panel, double-click the System icon.

<P><LI>On the Device Manager tab, make sure that the PCMCIA Card Socket
   device is listed and that it is disabled. Disabled devices are
   indicated with a red "X."

<P><LI>In Control Panel, double-click the PCMCIA Card icon.

<P><LI>Follow the PCMCIA Card Socket Wizard instructions.

<P><LI>When you are prompted to turn your computer off, do so. Make sure
   to leave your computer off for a few seconds, and then turn it back
   on. Do not press CTRL+ALT+DEL or use your computer's reset button to
   restart your computer.
<P>
</OL>After the Windows 95 protected-mode drivers for socket services are
enabled, you can install your PCMCIA card device. To do so, follow these
steps:

<OL><P><LI>Insert the device in the PCMCIA card socket.
<P>
   NOTE: You can insert the device before you turn the computer on, or
   after Windows 95 has started.

<P><LI>If the device is supported by Windows 95, Windows 95 automatically
   installs the appropriate drivers and, if necessary, requests that you
   restart your computer. (Most PCMCIA cards do not require a restart.)

<P><LI>If the device is not supported by Windows 95, Windows 95 displays
   a dialog box with these prompts:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Select which driver you want to install for your new hardware:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>          - Windows default driver (NOTE: this option is unavailable)

          - Driver from disk provided by hardware manufacturer

          - Do not install a driver (Windows will not prompt you again)

          - Select from a list of alternate drivers

   If you have a disk from the manufacturer that contains Windows 95
   drivers for your device, click option 2.

   If you have information from the manufacturer that this device
   emulates another device Windows 95 supports, click option 4 and select
   the appropriate device from the list.

</PRE></OL>If your PCMCIA card device does not work in protected-mode, perform the
following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Use Device Manager to remove the device, restart your computer, then
   let Windows 95 re-detect your hardware.

<P><LI>If your PCMCIA card is not detected and Windows 95 has a protected-mode
   driver for it, remove any "EMMExclude=" lines from the System.ini file
   or any exclusions on the Emm386.exe line in the Config.sys file, reboot
   your computer, and let Windows 95 redetect your hardware. Note that if
   the "EMMExclude=" line is the problem, you may hear one beep instead of
   the standard dual-tone beep when Windows 95 starts.

<P><LI>Perform this step only if you have a program that looks for a certain
   resource setting. Microsoft suggests that you upgrade the program in
   this case to conform to Windows 95 Plug and Play specifications.
<P>
   Force the PCMCIA card device to a specific configuration using the
   following steps:
<P>
   a. In Control Panel, double-click the System icon.
<P>
   b. Click the Device Manager tab, double-click the device icon, click
<P><PRE>      the device in question, and then click Properties.
</PRE><P>
   c. Click the Resources tab.
<P>
   d. Click the Use Automatic Settings check box to clear it.
<P>
   e. Click Change Setting and set the resources to the settings you want.
<P>
</OL>If some of your PCMCIA card devices work while another does not, it is
possible that the device is a different revision of a supported card and
that it will not work even though the driver is listed.
