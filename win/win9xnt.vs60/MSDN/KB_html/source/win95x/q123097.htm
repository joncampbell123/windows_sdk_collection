The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Windows 95, when you use Point and Print or the Add Printer Wizard to
install a network printer, the printer driver that the network printer is
using is installed. For example:
<P>
A Windows 95 computer is sharing a Hewlett-Packard LaserJet IIISi printer
that is capable of printing PCL or PostScript. If this printer is installed
on the server as a PostScript printer, the PostScript driver is installed
across the network. If this printer is installed on the server as a PCL
printer, the PCL driver is installed across the network.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Windows 95 is designed to install the printer driver that the server is
using.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
NOTE: These steps describe how to print using PostScript to a network
printer that is using the PCL driver. These steps can also be used for a
shared PostScript printer that you want to print to in PCL.
<P>
If you prefer to use the PostScript printer driver on a network printer
that is being shared as PCL, use one of the methods below.
<P>
Method 1: If you haven't yet installed the printer, use the following
<PRE>          steps:

          1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click
             Printers.

          2. Double-click the Add Printer icon.

          3. Follow the Add Printer Wizard instructions to install the
             PostScript printer of your choice as a local printer.

          4. Click the PostScript printer icon with the right (secondary)
             mouse button, then click Properties.

          5. Click the Details tab and type the network path in the
             Print to: box.

          6. Click OK.

</PRE>Method 2: If you have already installed the printer, use the following
<PRE>          steps:

          1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click
             Printers.

          2. Click the PCL printer icon with the right (secondary) mouse
             button, then click Properties.

          3. Click the Details tab, click New beside the Driver
             option, then click Yes when you are asked to continue.

          4. Click the manufacturer, then double-click the appropriate
             printer model. For example, to install the HP IIISi
             PostScript driver, click HP, then double-click HP LaserJet
             IIISi PostScript.

          5. Click OK.

</PRE>Method 3: Install the PostScript and PCL printer driver on the server
<PRE>          computer with two different share names. For example: Install the
          HP LaserJet IIISi printer and share it as \\&lt;server&gt;\IIISi.
          Install the HP LaserJet IIISi PostScript printer and share it as
          \\&lt;server&gt;\IIISiPS. Everyone who attaches to this share to print
          now has a choice of PostScript or PCL.
