The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
<LI>Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release versions 1, 2, 2.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you run Setup for the retail (non-OSR2) version of Windows 95 and try 
to install Windows 95 in a folder containing an OEM Service Release 
version of Windows 95, you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Windows Setup
   Setup found a compressed volume or a disk-cache utility on your 
   computer. Quit setup and check your compressed volume with your disk-
   compression software or remove the disk-cache utility. Then run Setup 
   again.

</PRE>If you continue trying to install Windows 95 on a hard disk using the 
FAT32 file system, you may receive error message "SU-0013."
<P>
If you are installing Windows 95 on a hard disk using the FAT16 file 
system, Setup continues but experiences numerous file version conflicts 
that generate the following message:
<P>
<PRE>   A file being copied is older than the file currently on your computer. 
   It is recommended that you keep your existing file.

</PRE>If you click Yes to keep the newer files, Setup finishes, but when you 
restart the computer you may experience any of the following symptoms:

<UL><LI>The computer stops responding (hangs) at the logo screen.

<LI>You receive the error message "Fatal Exception 0D has occurred at 
   0117:00007E1F."
<P>
</UL>Starting Windows 95 in Safe mode may generate the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Fatal Exception 0D has occurred at 0117:00007E1F.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The version of Windows 95 being installed is not the same version that is 
already installed. 
<P>
To verify the version you are installing, type "ver" at a command prompt. 
Version 4.00.950 (files dated 7-11-95)is retail and OEM (non-OSR2). 
Version 4.00.1111 (files dated 8-24-96) indicates Windows 95 OEM Service 
Release 2 (OSR2).
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Do not install the retail or OEM (non-OSR2) version of Windows 95 into an 
existing Windows 95 OSR2 folder. If you are installing to a hard disk 
using the FAT16 file system, install to a different folder. Do not install
the retail or OEM (non-OSR2) version of Windows 95 on a hard disk using 
the FAT32 file system.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you attempt to install the retail version of Windows 95 from the 
Windows 95 CD-ROM on a computer with OSR2 installed with the Auto Insert 
Notification option enabled, the Add/Remove Software option on the Autorun
menu is disabled. You receive the following warning:
<P>
<PRE>   This CD-ROM is from an older version of Windows than the one you are
   presently using. Setup functionality from this disk will be disabled.

</PRE>A warning does not appear if:

<UL><LI>You are installing from a CD-ROM but the Auto Insert Notification 
   option is disabled.

<LI>You browse the Windows 95 CD-ROM and you double-click Setup.exe.

<LI>You run Setup from the Run dialog box.
<P>
</UL>You should reinstall OSR2 using the OSR2 CD-ROM provided by your OEM. If 
an OSR2 CD-ROM was not provided to you by your OEM, the OSR2 files may 
have been provided in a flat folder on your hard disk. To locate this 
folder, type the following command at a command prompt:
<P>
<PRE>   dir *.cab /s

</PRE>To reinstall OSR2, run Setup.exe from the folder containing the OSR2 
cabinet (.cab) files.
<P>
Contact your OEM for assistance if:

<UL><LI>You do not have an OSR2 CD-ROM and you cannot locate a folder with the 
   cabinet files.

<LI>You cannot locate the Setup.exe file in the folder that contains the 
   cabinet files.
<P>
