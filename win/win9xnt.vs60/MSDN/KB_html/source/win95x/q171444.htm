   This article contains information about configuring or using 
   Windows 95 in a manner that has not been tested and is not 
   supported by Microsoft Technical Support.

   We suggest you back up your data before performing these steps. 
   If the steps described in this article do not function properly, 
   you may need to reinstall Windows 95 in order to restore your 
   system to its previous state.

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how to remove the Windows NT Boot Loader to remove
Windows NT from a dual-boot installation with Windows 95 and leave Windows
95 as the bootable operating system.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
WARNING: Following these steps may lead to data loss if your computer 
currently has a virus or you have disk-management software installed on 
your hard disk (such as OnTrack Disk Manager or Micro House EZDrive) to 
allow you to access a larger hard disk than your computer's BIOS supports.
<P>
NOTE: The following steps apply only to computers in which the boot drive 
(drive C) uses the FAT file system and Windows 95 is installed on the boot
drive.

<OL><P><LI>Back up the critical data on your hard disk, and verify that the 
   computer is not infected with a virus.

<P><LI>Boot the computer with your Windows 95 Startup disk. If you do not 
   have a Startup disk, you can create one. In Windows 95, double-click 
   Add/Remove Programs in Control Panel, click the Startup Disk tab, and 
   then click Create.

<P><LI>At the "A:" prompt, type "sys c:" (without quotation marks), and then 
   press ENTER. You should see a "System transferred" message.

<P><LI>Remove the Startup disk from the floppy disk drive, and then restart 
   the computer. Windows 95 should start.

<P><LI>If you have completed the above steps successfully, you can remove the
   folder containing Windows NT (typically C:\Winnt).

<P><LI>You can delete the following files from the root folder:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Ntldr
      Ntdetect.com
      Boot.ini
      Pagefile.sys (if present)
      Bootsect.dos
</PRE><P>
   All of these files except Ntldr are hidden. To view them, start My 
   Computer, click Options on the View menu, and then click Show All 
   Files. To view file name extensions, click the "Hide MS-DOS extensions
   for file types that are registered" check box to clear it. Click OK.
