The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release versions 2, 2.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you suspend and then resume a laptop computer with the hardware
Power/Resume button, the computer may power off instead.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Windows 95 power management driver may not properly handle a suspend
request and cause the computer to power off when the following conditions
exist:

<UL><LI>The computer is a laptop computer with a BIOS option to select the
   power-up (or resume) mode. Such an option determines whether the power
   button actually powers the computer on and off (for a full reboot), or
   simply suspends and resumes the computer.

<LI>The power-up (or resume) mode option is set to resume mode.

<LI>The computer is placed in its docking station and powered on.

<LI>The power button is pressed to place the computer in a suspended state.

<LI>The power button is pressed again to resume the computer.

<LI>Instead of resuming, the computer peforms a full power-off after about
   30 seconds.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this issue, set the power-up (or resume) mode option to
boot mode instead of resume mode. This causes the computer to completely
power off when it is shut down and perform a full boot when restarted,
instead of suspending when shut down and resuming when restarted.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95 OEM
Service Release 2 (OSR2). An update to address this problem is in
development, but has not been regression tested and may be destabilizing
in production environments. Microsoft does not recommend implementing
this update at this time. Contact Microsoft Technical Support for
more information about the availability of this update.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Depending on the state of programs running when the computer is first
suspended, current data that has not been saved to disk may be lost.
<P>
This symptom has been reported to occur with the following models of
laptop computers:

<UL><LI>Toshiba    Tecra 710/720/730
<LI>Toshiba    Tecra 500 Series
<LI>Toshiba    Portege 650
