<P><h2>MS-DOS-BASED AND WINDOWS-BASED PROGRAMS</h2>
 
<P>
NOTE: All of the following references to software deal with the
versions that were available at the time Windows 95 shipped. New
versions may now be available. For updated information about any
of the issues described here, contact your software vendor.
<P>
<P><h3>Animated Icons</h3>
 
Windows 95 does not support animated icons.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft MS-DOS Utilities Running Under Windows 95</h3>
 
The MS-DOS utilities that are installed into the \Windows\Command
directory have been enhanced to work with Windows 95. The disk repair
utilities that shipped with older versions of MS-DOS should not be
used with Windows 95. Most of the other MS-DOS utilities that worked
with Windows 3.1 should continue to work with Windows 95, but if they
were bound to an older version of MS-DOS, you may need to use the
SETVER command to enable them.
<P>
The following MS-DOS utility files will be deleted after you upgrade
from an earlier version of Windows:
<PRE>     Defrag.hlp
     Mwundel.exe
     Mwundel.hlp
     Networks.txt
     OS2.txt

</PRE>The following MS-DOS utility files will be upgraded after you upgrade
from an earlier version of Windows:
<PRE>     Ansi.sys
     Attrib.exe
     Chkdsk.exe
     Choice.com
     Country.sys

</PRE><h3>Re-installing Programs</h3>
 
If you upgrade your existing Windows 3.1 or Windows for Workgroups
directory to Windows 95, then you do not need to re-install your
programs. If you install Windows 95 to a new directory, then you must
re-install all of your Windows-based programs. Copying files from your
Windows 3.1 directory to Windows 95 is not sufficient.
<P>
<P><h3>MS-DOS-Based Programs</h3>
 
Your existing MS-DOS-based programs should run from Windows 95. If you
experience problems with an MS-DOS-based program, you can set it up to
run in an MS-DOS environment.
<P>
To run an MS-DOS-based program in an MS-DOS environment (MS-DOS mode):
1. Create a shortcut to the MS-DOS-based program.
2. Right click the shortcut icon, and then select Properties.
3. Click the Program tab, and then click Advanced.
4. Make sure that the MS-DOS Mode box is checked.
<P>
When you run a program in MS-DOS mode, it will force Windows 95 to
shut down and will load the program in an MS-DOS environment. Note
that you will not have access to devices that require protected-mode
drivers.
<P>
If you find an MS-DOS-based program slowing down or stopping when it
is in the background:
1. Right click the MS-DOS Prompt icon on the taskbar, and then click
<PRE>   Properties.
</PRE>2. Click the Misc tab.
3. Drag the Idle Sensitivity slider toward Low.
4. In the Background area, make sure that Always Suspend is not
<PRE>   checked.

</PRE><h3>Anti-Virus Software</h3>
 
Existing Anti-Virus software should be able to detect, but not always
clean, viruses while running on Windows 95. This depends on where the
virus was found and how the program chose to clean it. Also, virus
shields may not be able to see all file activity, and therefore
could miss some virus activity. It is recommended that you update
your anti-virus software to a version that was designed to run with
Windows 95.
<P>
To contact McAfee for information about their new anti-virus software:
McAfee BBS:(408) 988-4004, McAfee direct line: (408) 988-3832.
<P>
To contact Symantec Corporation for information about their anti-virus
software: (800) 441-7234 or (541) 334-6054.
<P>
<P><h3>Disk Repair and Optimization Utilities</h3>
 
To make it possible to store long filenames on a FAT volume, it was
necessary to change the file system for Windows 95. Those changes will
prevent most existing disk repair and optimization programs from
functioning correctly. Depending on how they function, Windows may
block them from executing in order to protect the data on your disk.
This is necessary in a multi-tasking environment to prevent disk
corruption caused by multiple utilities running simultaneously. It is
strongly recommended that you upgrade to disk repair software that was
designed for Windows 95. For more information, contact your software
vendor.
<P>
<P><h3>Disk-Compression Utilities</h3>
 
Windows 95 works with most major disk-compression products. However,
since many of these products come with optimization utilities, it is
recommended that you upgrade to the version designed for Windows 95.
For more information, contact your software vendor.
<P>
<P><h3>Windows 3.1 Shell Enhancements</h3>
 
Most Windows 3.1 shell replacements will still run on Windows 95, but
with many limitations because of the taskbar, 32-bit components, and
the new Windows 95 shell. If you want to continue running one of these
programs, you should upgrade to a version that was designed to run
with Windows 95.
<P>
Major Windows 3.1 shell enhancements this may affect: Norton Desktop,
PC Tools Desktop, Tabworks, Dashboard, and Direct Access Desktop 1.0.
<P>
<P><h3>Using UNC Network Names with Existing Software</h3>
 
There are three ways to assign a network resource in Windows 95.

<OL><P><LI>Assign a network resource by using its UNC name. UNC names are
   in the format \\server\share. Windows 95 defaults to this method.
</OL>2. Assign a local name to the network resource; for example, assign
<PRE>   one of your LPT ports to a network printer.
</PRE></OL>3. Assign a drive letter to a remote disk drive. This was the default
<PRE>   behavior in Windows 3.1 and is still supported in Windows 95.

</PRE>Using a UNC name removes much of the ambiguity of the older method
that Windows 3.1 used. UNC names tend to be longer than their Windows
3.1 equivalents and this can cause problems for some programs. If you
experience such problems, you can revert to the Windows 3.1 method
of addressing network resources. For more information, look up
"capturing, printer ports" and "mapping, drive letters" in the
Windows Help index.
<P>
This may affect the following programs: Design CAD 2D for Windows,
CorelDraw for Windows, Corel Photo Paint 5, ccMail, Quickbooks 3.0,
Lotus Notes, MS Profit 1.0b.
<P>
<P><h3>Notes on Specific MS-DOS-Based and Windows-Based Programs</h3>
 
Adaptec EZ-SCSI 3.1: When this program is run with Windows 95,
you may experience the following product limitations:
<P>
-  Adaptec EZ-SCSI will not modify your Config.sys and/or
<PRE>   Autoexec.bat files like it does under Windows 3.1. To use
   real-mode device drivers with Windows 95, you will need to run
   EZ-SCSI for DOS. To do this, start Windows 95, and then when you
   see the message "Starting Windows 95", choose Command Prompt Only.
   Your Config.sys and and Autoexec.bat files will be modified
   automatically as needed.
</PRE>-  The SCSI Power Management device driver included with Adaptec
<PRE>   EZ-SCSI 3.1 is not compatible with Windows 95.
</PRE>-  The SCSI tape backup package does not support backing up long
<PRE>   filenames.

</PRE>For information about Adaptec software products designed specifically
for Windows 95, please contact Adaptec direct at (800) 959-7274 or
(408) 945-8600.
<P>
Adobe Persuasion: You cannot install Adobe Persuasion version 3.0
if your Config.sys file is empty or has not been created. This is not
a problem if you are upgrading over an earlier version of Windows or
MS-DOS.
<P>
To create a Config.sys file:
1. Click the Start menu, click Programs, click Accessories, and then
<PRE>   click Notepad.
</PRE>2. Type "rem This is a temporary config.sys file."
3. Click File, and then click Save.
4. Type C:\Config.sys, and then press ENTER.
5. Continue to install Adobe Persuasion 3.0.
<P>

Customer Service at (800) 833-6687. Outside the United States, call
(425) 622-5500 or the number that came with your program.
<P>
Alacrity E-Quip: If you have Alacrity E-Quip or E-Quip + release
1.33D or earlier, you may experience faxing and/or OCR problems. For
upgrade information, contact Alacrity at: fax (908) 813-2490,
BBS (908) 813-2495.
<P>
Ami Pro v3.01: To run the Ami Pro v3.01 tutorial correctly, you must
set your Windows 95 taskbar to Auto-Hide. To do this:
1. Click the Start menu, click Settings, and then click Taskbar.
2. Make sure the Auto hide option is checked.
<P>
AST Works: If you have problems with the voicemail program that comes
with AST Works, you will need to obtain updated files. Those files are
available on the Windows driver library, which can be ordered
separately.
<P>
Astound 2.x: If you experience printing problems, open the properties
for your printer and turn off EMS spooling.
<P>
ATM fonts: ATM fonts will not show up on the font list when certain
printer drivers for fax programs are selected as the default. You will
have this problem with WinFax (all versions), FaxWorks, and older
Quick Link 2 versions. A substitute TrueType font will be used
instead.
<P>
AT&amp;T Mail Access PLUS: If you use AT&amp;T Mail Access PLUS for DOS or
AT&amp;T Mail Access Plus for Windows (earlier than version 2.7), you need
to upgrade to the latest release of Access PLUS for Windows in order
to work well on Windows 95. With the latest release, you'll get AT&amp;T's
new mail engine, Mail Transport, which eliminates the need for the
Background Mailer TSR that was in earlier releases. To order an Access
PLUS upgrade or to get more information about other AT&amp;T messaging
products and services, call (800) 242-6005 and ask for Department 95.
<P>
Cheyenne ARCSOLO 3.02: Under Windows 95, ARCSOLO 3.02 cannot connect
to the network drives mapped through the Client for NetWare Networks
(Nwredir.vxd)and Client for Microsoft Networks (VREDIR) when the
drives are already mapped. To work around this problem, add the
following line to the [boot] section of your System.ini file:
<PRE>     network.drv=commctrl.dll

</PRE>NOTE: Any DLL will work; this is a 16-bit dll.
<P>
ClarisWorks for Windows 3.0 v1: To install correctly, you must run the
SETUPCW program on disk 2. The Setup program on disk 1 will not
install the program under Windows 95.
<P>
Conner Tape Backup: Because of enhancements to the Windows 95 file
system, which supports long filenames, the Conner tape backup
program does not work with Windows 95. For information about an
updated version of this utility, call Conner Peripherals at Conner
Express, (800) 531-0968; ask for the Conner Backup Executive (CBE).
Or call Conner's FaxBack system at (408) 456-4903.
<P>
DragonDictate for Windows: For information about the availability of
an upgrade that may be compatible with Windows 95, call Dragon Systems
at (800) 825-5897 or (617) 965-5200.
<P>
Faxworks v3.0: You may experience problems if your default printer
name is extremely long, which could prevent the Call Center dialog box
from appearing. If this happens, shorten the printer name or, if you
are printing to a network printer, capture the printer port. For
instructions on how to capture a printer port, see Windows Help.
<P>
FaxWorks version 3.00f.041: The Advanced AGC option (audio gain
control) is designed to adjust incoming call voice volume. This option
does not work with Windows 95. Using this option creates a .tmp file
in your Temp directory which gradually grows to fill the disk and
cause a system lockup.
<P>
Finesse: The Finesse program that was written for Windows 3.1 prevents
Windows 95 from correctly displaying taskbar buttons. If you use this
program, buttons representing your running programs will not appear
correctly on the taskbar. To switch between open programs, press
ALT+TAB. If you are in the United States, call your local Toshiba
product support organization for more information. Or you can call
(800) 999-4273. Outside the United States, call the product support
number that came with this program.
<P>
Fonts: Only TrueType fonts can be printed with Windows version 1.0
printer drivers. If a version 1.0 printer driver is selected, only
TrueType fonts will be displayed in the font list. WinFax Pro 4.0 is
the only known shipping program with a Windows 1.0 printer driver.
<P>

Lotus Notes Windows Client 3.2: If you are using the NetBIOS interface
over IPX and the NetBEUI protocol stacks, then it is necessary to
configure the port for NetBIOS using the unit number that properly
corresponds to that protocol. The default number for the first NetBIOS
protocol is first set to 0, then any additional NetBIOS interface will
start at port 7 through 1. It is likely that NetBIOS will use 7 or 6
if NetBEUI is using 0. To make changes, in the Lotus Notes Windows
client, click the Tools menu, click Setup, and then click Ports.
<P>
