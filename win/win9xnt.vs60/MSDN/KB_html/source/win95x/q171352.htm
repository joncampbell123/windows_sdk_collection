<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you are attempting to use the Windows Sockets (WinSock) interface to 
transfer large blocks of data using the SPX protocol, the transfer may not
work. When this problem occurs, the program being used to transfer the 
data may appear to have stopped responding (hung). Depending on the 
configuration, this problem may occur when the size of the data block 
exceeds 15-40K.
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Windows Sockets IPX/SPX Protocol Driver (WSIPX) may not allocate 
enough internal resources to allow large blocks of data to be received 
successfully.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95 and 
OEM Service Release 2 (OSR2). An update to address this problem is now 
available, but is not fully regression tested and should be applied only 
to computers experiencing this specific problem. Unless you are severely 
impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft does not recommend 
implementing this update at this time. Contact Microsoft Technical Support
for additional information about the availability of this update.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
It is possible to work around this problem by rewriting the program that 
uses WinSock to transfer the data so that the program transfers a smaller 
block of data at a time.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The updated component allows up to 64K of data to be successfully sent and
received in a single block.
