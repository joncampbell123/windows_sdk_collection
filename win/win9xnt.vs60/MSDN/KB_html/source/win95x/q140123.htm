The information in this article applies to:

<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how to set up and use ISDN (Integrated Services
Digital Network) terminal adapters in Windows 95.
<P>
Currently, Windows 95 supports only the following ISDN adapters:

<UL><LI>Motorola BitSURFR (needs version 1E EPROM)
<LI>Motorola TA210 (needs version 1E EPROM)
<LI>Motorola TA110-120
<P>
</UL>Microsoft supports the detection of these adapters, but does not support
setting them up. In order to properly set up an ISDN adapter, you need to
obtain information from the adapter's manufacturer and your ISDN provider.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Detection and Setup of ISDN Terminal Adapters</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Install the adapter using the Windows 95 Modem .inf file. Automatic
   detection of the adapter or Plug and Play detection typically provides
   this using native .inf files. Use the Modems tool in Control Panel, or
   if the adapter is a Plug and Play device, shut down and restart the
   computer. A new ISDN adapter should include a disk with a Windows 95
   .inf file that should be installed following the manufacturer's
   instructions.

<P><LI>Configure the adapter using an ISDN setup tool. Adjust values and
   settings to prepare the adapter for ISDN use. Typically, the
   adapter's S registers are adjusted during this step. (S registers
   are memory storage locations within the adapter that are used to store
   information about the adapter's operating parameters.)
<P>
   These values are typically provided by the local phone company when
   ISDN service is provided. Other values for the adapter are derived
   from documentation accompanying the adapter.
<P>
   Some ISDN adapter vendors provide MS-DOS-based or Windows-based ISDN
   adapter configuration tools. These tools should run with Windows 95 and
   should be used to configure the adapter.
<P>
</OL><h3>Setting S Registers</h3>
 
<P>
Setting Specific Profile ID (SPID) and other ISDN values typically
involves adjusting S registers. You can use HyperTerminal for this
purpose. Follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Install the adapter.

<P><LI>Check the Modems tool in Control Panel. The ISDN adapter should be
   listed.

<P><LI>Start HyperTerminal. You may need to configure HyperTerminal with a
   telephone number.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Properties.

<P><LI>In the Connect Using box, click Direct To Com&lt;X&gt;, where &lt;X&gt; is the
   number of the port the ISDN adapter is using. Click OK.

<P><LI>Use Hayes-style AT commands to set the adapter's S registers.
   For example, to set register 10 to a value of 30, type the
   following line:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ats10=30
</PRE>
<P><LI>When you finish setting up the adapter, select the ISDN adapter, rather
   than Direct To Com&lt;X&gt;, in the Connect Using box.
<P>
</OL><h3>Dual Capability Adapters</h3>
 
<P>
A few ISDN adapters have both analog line capability and ISDN features.
Typically, you can use AT commands with these adapters in either analog or
ISDN mode. The functionality of these adapters is dependent on the .inf
file included by the adapter's manufacturer. The .inf file may allow you
to select either the adapter's analog or its ISDN capabilities, or it may
support a default ISDN configuration only.
<P>
<P><h3>Dual-Channel ISDN</h3>
 
<P>
Many ISDN adapters and local phone companies provide ISDN service that
provides two channels at the same time (a data channel and a voice
channel). Both channels can be operational during the same connection.
Note that the voice channel on some ISDN devices can also be converted to
a data channel, boosting data transfer capability. Manufacturer's
documents and local phone company instructions should be consulted to use
this dual-channel feature.
<P>
<P><h3>Dial-Up Networking 1.2 Upgrade</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft has released the Dial-Up Networking 1.2 Upgrade. This release
includes the support necessary for making remote access connections over
an ISDN line. For additional information, please see the following article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
