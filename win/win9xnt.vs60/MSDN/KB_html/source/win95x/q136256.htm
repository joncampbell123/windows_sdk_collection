The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego version 1.0 for
Windows, MIDI music files may not be played. Wave (.wav) audio files
are played correctly.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The method used by this program to determine where to send MIDI sound may
cause the sound to be sent to the external MIDI output. This can occur even
if you selected internal playback when you installed the program.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this issue, upgrade to version 1.01 or later of the program. To
determine which version of the program you are running, look at the CD-ROM.
Version 1.0 has the words "MPC (Windows)" printed on it, while version 1.01
does not.
<P>
Also, the CD-ROM for version 1.0 has the volume label "worldmp." Version
1.01 has the volume label "world101."
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This situation is most likely caused by design changes in Windows 95.
Microsoft has confirmed that it is not caused by a problem in Windows 95.
For more information about resolving this issue, please contact Broderbund
Software.
