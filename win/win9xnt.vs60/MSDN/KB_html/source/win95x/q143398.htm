The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you try to use the Remote Registry service to remotely administer a
computer running the Microsoft Service for NetWare Directory Services
(MSNDS), you may receive one of the following error messages:

<UL><LI>Unable to connect to &lt;computer name&gt;. Make sure that this computer
   is on the network, has remote administration enabled, and that both
   computers are running remote registry service.

<LI>Unable to connect to &lt;computer name&gt;. Make sure you have permission
   to administer the computer.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
These errors can occur if any of the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>You attempt to use the Remote Registry service while you are logged on
   to a NetWare Directory Services (NDS) tree, and you are using a server
   for user-level security that is part of the same NDS tree.

<LI>You are logging on to an NDS tree and your password on the NDS tree
   is different than the password for your account on the server that is
   providing user-level security.

<LI>Bindery emulation is not set to the correct container on the NetWare
   4.x server you are using for user-level security.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To connect to a remote workstation using the Remote Registry service with
MSNDS, the following requirements must be met:

<UL><LI>Both workstations must be set up for the Remote Registry service.

<LI>Both workstations must have Remote Administration set up correctly.
   For additional information, please see the following article in the
   Microsoft Knowledge Base:

<P><PRE>      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../zmiscellaneous/q141460.htm">Q141460</A></B>
<PRE></PRE>      TITLE     : How to Install Remote Administration Services

</PRE><LI>User-level security must be installed and set to a bindery-based
   NetWare server that is not part of the NDS tree. The server can be
   either a NetWare 3.x server or a NetWare 4.x server with bindery
   emulation set for the container where user accounts reside. This
   server cannot be a member of the NDS tree you log on to.

<LI>Your password for the NDS tree must be the same as the password on the
   server you are using for user-level security.
<P>
   NOTE: If your password for the user-level security server has been
   cached, it is possible to use a different password for logging
   on to the NDS tree.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Remote Registry service requires the use of user-level security and
is currently a bindery-based tool that does not understand NDS. Therefore,
the server used for user-level security must not be part of the NDS tree
you are logging on to.
