The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After you install Windows 95, it may appear that your external modem can
no longer receive data. You may be able to connect and send data, but the
modem does not receive any data.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem can occur if the external modem is connected to your computer
with a serial cable, serial switch box, or other hardware device that is
defective or not configured correctly for hardware flow control (RTS/CTS).
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this problem, use either of the following methods:

<UL><LI>Replace the device used to connect the external modem to the computer
   if the device is defective, or configure it for hardware flow control.

<LI>You may be able to work around the problem by configuring the modem
   for software flow control. To do so, follow these steps:
<P>
   1. In Control Panel, double-click the Modems icon.
<P>
   2. Click the modem you are using, and then click Properties.
<P>
   3. On the Connection tab, click the Advanced button.
<P>
   4. Make sure that the Use Flow Control check box is selected, and
<P><PRE>      then click the Software (XON/XOFF) option button.
</PRE><P>
   5. Click OK until you return to Control Panel.
<P>
   NOTE: This workaround affects only 32-bit communications programs. If
   you are using a 16-bit program, you must configure the modem to use
   software flow control in the program itself. For information on how to
   do so, please consult the program's documentation.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Windows and Windows for Workgroups version 3.x use software flow control
by default. Windows 95 uses hardware flow control by default, which
typically results in better modem performance. However, if your external
modem is connected to your computer with a defective or incorrectly
configured serial device, you may be unable to use hardware flow control.
