<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Windows 95 is designed to function with advanced power management (APM)
enabled computers. Some computers conform to the APM specification 1.0;
others use APM 1.1. Although Windows 95 works with both specifications,
there are advantages to using APM 1.1.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Windows 95's functionality improves with APM 1.1 because version 1.1 is
designed to give the operating system more control over power management
than APM 1.0 permitted. For example:

<UL><LI>If a computer is using APM 1.1, the operating system can force the
   BIOS to wait (essentially indefinitely) until it has prepared the
   running programs and drivers for suspend mode.

<LI>If a computer is using APM 1.1, the operating system can reject the
   request for suspend mode.
<P>
</UL>The operating system does not have this control in APM 1.0. These features
help stabilize the suspend function in a Windows 95/APM 1.1 environment.
<P>
Enhancements in APM 1.1 allow applications and system components to become
more actively involved in the suspend/resume process. Windows 95 also
queries the APM BIOS more thoroughly than previous versions of Windows by
obtaining more accurate information regarding the power state and the
remaining battery life. This is possible because APM 1.1 provides more
accurate reporting of the remaining battery power and documents the
specification more legibly than APM 1.0, helping to make power management
more reliable.
