The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes Windows 95 .gid (global index) files.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Windows 95 creates a .gid file in the following circumstances:

<UL><LI>When you use a Help file that was not created in the Windows 95 Help
   format, Windows 95 creates a corresponding .gid file if one does not
   exist.

<LI>If Windows 95 finds an outdated .gid file, it recreates the file. Note
   that a .gid file is considered to be outdated if the Help file has
   been updated but has not been opened by Windows 95 since it was
   updated.
<P>
</UL>The process of searching for and creating .gid files occurs when you see
the "Setting Up Help" message. A .gid file has the same name as its
corresponding Help file (but with a .gid extension) and is stored as a
hidden file in the same folder as the corresponding Help file. If the Help
file is in a folder to which you do not have write privileges (such as on
a CD-ROM or network drive), the .gid file is created in the Windows\Help
folder.
<P>
Windows 95 stores pointers to all the topics and entry points in a Help
file in the corresponding .gid file for the following reasons:

<UL><LI>This information is not stored in the Help file itself in order to
   minimize the size of the Help file.

<LI>Windows 95 uses .gid files as status files (for example, the Help
   window position is stored in this file).
<P>
</UL>Note that Windows and Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 and higher can
use .gid files if the following conditions are met:

<UL><LI>You installed Win32s.

<LI>You installed the 32-bit Help compiler and its associated .dll files.
<P></UL>
