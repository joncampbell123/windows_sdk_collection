<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you are copying a file over the network to a directory containing a
file with the same name, if the file transfer process is canceled or fails,
the file being replaced is deleted.
<P>
This behavior also occurs when you are using Dial-Up Networking.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
During the file transfer process, the destination file (the file that is to
be replaced) is deleted after you confirm that you want to replace a file.
If the file transfer process is canceled or fails, the deleted destination
file cannot be restored. The file is not moved to the Recycle Bin and
cannot be recovered.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
If the file transfer process is canceled or fails, repeat the transfer.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Recycle Bin tracks only files deleted locally using Windows Explorer,
My Computer, or a Windows 95-compatible shell program.
<P>
A file that is deleted as part of a file transfer process between two
computers is not moved to the Recycle Bin.
