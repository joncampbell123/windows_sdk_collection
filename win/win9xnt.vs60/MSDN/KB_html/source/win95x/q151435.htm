<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you send a fax from Microsoft Exchange, the received fax cover page
may appear off center, or part of the cover page may appear to be missing.
The remaining fax pages are correct.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior can occur if the sender of the fax opened the cover page in
Cover Page Editor and then saved the cover page with the wrong paper size.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To view the cover page, open it in Cover Page Editor. Determine if the
cover page you are using is positioned (or looks) the same as the received
fax. If so, it is likely that the page size is set incorrectly. To verify
this and correct the situation, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Programs, point to Accessories, point
   to Fax, and then click Cover Page Editor.

<P><LI>Open the cover page you are using. If the cover page appears off center
   or part of the page is missing, continue with step 3.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Page Setup.

<P><LI>In the Paper Size box, click a standard size (such as Letter).

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Save.

<P><LI>Quit Cover Page Editor.

<P><LI>Try sending a test fax.
