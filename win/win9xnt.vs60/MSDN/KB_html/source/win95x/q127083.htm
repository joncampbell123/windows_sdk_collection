The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you install Windows 95 on a computer with an uninterruptible power
supply (UPS) attached to a serial port, the UPS switches to battery mode
during the hardware detection portion of Setup. If Setup does not finish
before the battery in the UPS runs out, the UPS shuts down and the computer
restarts.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The hardware detection portion of Setup attempts to detect the computer's
serial ports. The method that Setup uses to query the serial ports can
cause some serial-port-monitoring UPS models to believe that the external
power has failed.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Disconnect the UPS monitoring cable from the serial port before you run
Windows 95 Setup.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following UPS models are known to exhibit the behavior described
above:

<UL><LI>American Power Conversion Smart-UPS series (all models)
<LI>American Power Conversion Matrix series (all models)
<P>
</UL>The products included here are manufactured by a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these
