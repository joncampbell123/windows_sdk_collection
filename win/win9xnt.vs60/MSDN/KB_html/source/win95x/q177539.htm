<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After receiving spoofed connection request (SYN) packets over TCP/IP, a
computer running Windows 95 may begin to operate slowly. After about one
minute, Windows returns to normal operation.
<P>
This problem may occur with TCP/IP on other operating systems as well.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs due to "Land Attack." Land Attack sends SYN packets
with the same source and destination IP addresses and the same source and
destination ports to a host computer. This makes it appear as if the host
computer sent the packets to itself. Windows 95 operates more slowly while
the host computer tries to respond to itself.
<P>
