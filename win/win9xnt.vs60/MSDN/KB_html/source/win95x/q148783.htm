<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you are using a Future Domain TMC-850, TMC-850M, TMC-850MER, or TMC-
850MEX SCSI controller with the Future Domain TMC-850/M/MER/MEX SCSI Host
Adapter driver included with Windows 95, you may experience poor sound
quality in some multimedia programs. This problem is known to occur with
the following multimedia programs, but the problem is not program-
specific:

<UL><LI>George Shrinks
<LI>Infopedia
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This is a known problem that can occur with the Future Domain SCSI
controllers listed above when the corresponding protected-mode drivers
included with Windows 95 are used. The Future Domain 850-series SCSI
controllers are 8-bit controllers that may experience performance problems
with more intensive multimedia programs, even when the real-mode drivers
included with the controller are used. However, this poor performance is
more pronounced when the protected-mode drivers included with Windows 95
are used.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, use the real-mode drivers included with the
Future Domain SCSI controller and your CD-ROM drive instead of the
protected-mode drivers included with Windows 95. For information about how
to do so, consult the documentation included with the devices, or contact
the manufacturer. Note that when you are using a real-mode driver for the
CD-ROM drive, you must also load the Mscdex.exe file located in the
Windows\Command folder from the Autoexec.bat file.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95.
We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
