IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it
if a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the
"Restoring the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a
Registry  Key" Help topic in Regedt32.exe.
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After you add a new hard disk, either the new hard disk or a preexisting
drive (such as a CD-ROM drive) may no longer be listed in My Computer.
The drive remains accessible from a command prompt.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When you create a compressed hard disk volume, the compressed volume
receives the drive letter of the original drive (for example, drive C),
and the original uncompressed (or host) drive is relocated to a higher
drive letter (for example, drive E).
<P>
When the compressed volume is created, Explorer.exe is instructed to not
show the host drive in My Computer (in this example, drive E.)
<P>
When you add a new hard disk, it receives a drive letter assignment (for
example, drive D), causing all subsequent drive letters to shift by one.
For example, if a CD-ROM was drive D, it is relocated to drive E.
<P>
When Explorer.exe follows its instructions not to show drive E, it
inadvertently hides the CD-ROM drive instead of the actual host drive
(which has now moved to drive F).
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall Windows 95. Microsoft cannot guarantee
that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be
solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
NOTE: For information about how to edit the registry, view the Changing
Keys And Values online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Note
that you should make a backup copy of the registry files (System.dat and
User.dat) before you edit the registry.
<P>
To work around this issue delete the "NoDrives" value in the following
registry key:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\
      Policies\Explorer

</PRE>After you make this change, log off and then back on to the computer.
<P>
This instructs Explorer.exe to show all drives.
