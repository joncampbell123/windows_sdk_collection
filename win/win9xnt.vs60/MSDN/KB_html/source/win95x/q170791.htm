<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you are running programs in Windows 95 that use excessive numbers 
of TCP ports (more than 3976 simultaneously), Windows may run out of TCP 
ports before the TCP/IP protocol releases closed connections.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The TCP/IP state dictates that when a connection is closed, the connection
is not released until two maximum segment lives (MSLs) have passed. This 
state is defined as the TIME-WAIT state. One MSL is defined as 120 
seconds, and it takes four minutes for a closed connection to be released
in TCP/IP.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95 and 
OEM Service Release 2 (OSR2). An update to address this problem is now 
available, but is not fully regression tested and should be applied only 
to computers experiencing this specific problem. Unless you are severely 
impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft does not recommend 
implementing this update at this time. Contact Microsoft Technical Support
for additional information about the availability of this update.
