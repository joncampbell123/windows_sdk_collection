WINDOWS
kbreadme
<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The following information is a copy of the information in the Microsoft
Plus! for Windows 95 Readme.txt file (part 2 of 2).
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>If Your Mouse Pointers Do Not Animate</h3>
 
<P>
To use animated pointers in Microsoft Plus!, you must use protected-
mode disk drivers and a Windows 95-compatible display driver that
uses the device-independent bitmap (DIB) engine AND meets at least
one of the following criteria:

<UL><LI>The display driver is set to 256 colors or higher, and supports
   color pointers.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>The display driver allows Windows 95 to access its memory in a
   linear fashion (such as through a frame buffer) to provide smoother
   animation.
<P>
</UL>The following display drivers do NOT support animated mouse pointers:

<UL><LI>ATI Ultra (mach8)
   This driver does not support a frame buffer.

<LI>Diamond Viper
   This driver is based on the Windows 3.1 video standard.

<LI>Standard Display Adapter (VGA)
   This driver is based on a standard established before animated
   pointers were developed.

<LI>Super VGA
   This driver is based on a standard established before animated
   pointers were developed.
<P>
</UL>To determine if you are using protected-mode disk drivers:

<OL><P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click
   Control Panel.

<P><LI>Double-click the System icon.

<P><LI>Click the Performance tab, click File System, and then
   click the Troubleshooting tab.

<P><LI>If "Disable All 32-bit Protect-Mode Disk Drivers" is NOT checked,
<P><PRE>    you are using protected-mode disk drivers.
</PRE><P>
</OL>If your system meets these requirements but your mouse pointers
still do not animate, scan your computer for viruses. Boot-sector
viruses can prevent mouse pointers from animating.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>If You Use Desktop Themes with Programs that Have Their Own Color Palette</h3>
 
<P>
If your display is configured for 256 colors and you are using a desktop
theme, when you switch to another program (such as Microsoft Encarta,
Microsoft Office 95 Shortcut bar (!), Autorun, and Multi-Media Catalog)
that
uses its own color palette, the wallpaper may flash, and then may be
repainted using the colors from the program's palette. This may cause your
screen colors to look strange.
<P>
To solve this problem, you can:
<P>
-- Change the Color Palette setting for your display to High Color.
<PRE>   NOTE: You may need to purchase additional VRAM or reduce the screen
   resolution to run your display in High Color mode.

</PRE></OL>-- Use programs that do not use their own display palettes.
<P>
-- Use the Windows default wallpaper, icons and colors in place of those
<PRE>   that come with the desktop themes.


</PRE><h3>If Your Mouse Pointers Flicker or Leave Trails When Using a Theme</h3>
 
<P>
On some displays, the mouse pointers in a desktop theme may flicker
or leave "trails" of dots behind them. To prevent this from
happening, use the Windows default pointers instead of the pointers
for your theme.
<P>
To use the Windows default pointers with a theme, make sure the Mouse
Pointers box is NOT checked when you apply the theme. If you are
already using a theme, you will need to restore your desktop to the
Windows default settings before you can use a theme with the Windows
default pointers.
<P>
To restore your desktop to the default settings, and then use the
default pointers with a theme:

<OL><P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Control
   Panel.

<P><LI>Double-click the Desktop Themes icon.

<P><LI>In the Theme list, click "Windows Default," and then click Apply.

<P><LI>In the Theme list, click the theme you want to use.

<P><LI>Make sure the Mouse Pointers box is NOT checked, and then choose OK.
<P>
<P>
</OL><h3>If Your Large Desktop Icons Look Jagged</h3>
 
<P>
If your desktop icons are large, and some of the icons look
jagged or have poor resolution, then those programs did not provide
large icons for use with the Use Large Icons display option.
<P>
To improve the look of your desktop, you might want to use small
(standard) desktop icons instead of large icons.
<P>
To stop using large icons:

<OL><P><LI>Right-click the desktop, and then click Properties.

<P><LI>Click the Plus! tab.

<P><LI>Make sure the Use Large Icons box is unchecked.
<P>
<P>
</OL><h3>If Your Desktop Icons Look Blotchy</h3>
 
<P>
If you are using a desktop theme and your desktop icons don't look
right (they are too dark, blotchy, or the shadowing doesn't seem
right), try disabling some or all graphics acceleration for your
display.
<P>
To disable your display's graphics acceleration:

<OL><P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Control
   Panel.

<P><LI>Double-click the System icon.

<P><LI>Click the Performance tab, and then click Graphics.

<P><LI>Move the Hardware Acceleration slider bar towards "None."
<P>
   NOTE: If you reinstall Windows 95, the slider will be reset to
   the default position. In this case, you will need to repeat this
   procedure to turn off graphics acceleration.
<P>
<P>
</OL><h3>If Your Quicken Version 4.0 Program Does Not Look Right</h3>
 
<P>
If you are using a desktop theme while using Quicken Version 4.0, the
Quicken program window may not look right on your screen. To solve
this problem, use the Windows default color settings instead of the
color settings that come with your theme.
<P>
To apply the Windows default color settings after you've selected a
theme:

<OL><P><LI>Use the right mouse button to click anywhere on the desktop, and
   then click the Appearance tab.

<P><LI>In the Scheme list, click Windows Standard.
<P>
</OL>To preserve the Windows color scheme when selecting a new theme:
<P>
<PRE> &gt; In the Desktop Themes window, make sure the Colors box is
   unchecked.


</PRE></OL><h3>If You Use Desktop Themes in Conjunction With User Profiles</h3>
 
<P>
If your computer is configured with a different user profile for
each user, and one user selects a particular desktop theme,
all users of that computer will now see the icons and screen
saver associated with that theme. Other elements of a desktop
theme (for example, background wallpaper or screen colors) are
saved on a per-user basis.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>OTHER MICROSOFT PLUS! PROGRAMS</h2>
 
<P>
This section contains notes about other Microsoft Plus! programs.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Using Dial-Up Server with Fax Programs</h3>
 
<P>
If Dial-Up Server is enabled, it answers all incoming calls
on the first ring. This prevents fax programs, such as
Microsoft Fax, from answering any incoming faxes.
<P>
To enable your fax program to answer incoming faxes, turn off
Dial-Up Server.
<P>
To turn off Dial-Up Server:

<OL><P><LI>On the desktop, double-click My Computer.

<P><LI>Double-click the Dial-Up Networking icon.

<P><LI>Click the Connections menu, and then click Dial-Up Server.

<P><LI>Click the No Caller Access option.
<P>
<P>
</OL><h3>If Dial-Up Networking Won't Let You Save Your Password</h3>
 
<P>
When you place a call to a remote computer by using a Dial-Up
Networking connection, the Connect To dialog box appears.
If the Save Password check box is not enabled:

<OL><P><LI>In Control Panel, double-click the Network icon, and
   then click Add.

<P><LI>In the Select Network Component Type dialog box,
   click Client, and then click Add.

<P><LI>In the list of manufacturers, click Microsoft, click
   Client for Microsoft Networks, and then click OK.

<P><LI>Click the Identification tab, and then enter unique
   names for your computer and workgroup.

<P><LI>Restart your computer. (When your computer starts, Windows
   will prompt you to log on to your system by typing a
   username and password. If you want, you can leave the
   Password box blank.)
<P>
<P>
</OL><h3>If You Can't Connect to a Microsoft Plus! Dial-Up Server</h3>
 
<P>
If you cannot connect to a computer that is configured as
a Microsoft Plus! Dial-Up Server, make sure your computer
and the other computer are both using a common protocol
in addition to TCP/IP. (Dial-Up Server cannot route TCP/IP.)
<P>
To solve this problem, an additional Microsoft network protocol,
such as NetBEUI or IPX, might need to be added to one or both
machines. To add a protocol:

<OL><P><LI>In Control Panel, double-click the Network icon, and then
   click Add.

<P><LI>In the Select Network Component Type dialog box, click
   Protocol, and then click Add.

<P><LI>In the list of manufacturers, click Microsoft, and then
   select the network protocol you want.
<P>
<P>
</OL><h3>If You Have Problems with the Sound Effects in 3D Pinball</h3>
 
<P>
If you are experiencing a problem with the sound effects in Pinball,
you can try running the Wmconfig program to fix the problem.

<OL><P><LI>Run the Wmconfig program.
<P>
   Wmconfig is located in the folder that contains your 3D Pinball
   files (typically, in the C:\PROGRAM FILES\PLUS!\PINBALL folder).

<P><LI>In Wmconfig, select your sound card from the list. If you don't
   know which sound card you have or you can't find it, click the
   first Generic option in the list, and then click the Test button.
<P>
   To find out which sound card you have, right-click My Computer
   on the desktop, click Properties, and click the Device Manager
   tab. Then, click the + to the left of Sound, Video, and Game
   Controllers.

<P><LI>Continue testing Generic sound options until the sound effects
   sound the way you want them to.

<P><LI>Restart Pinball.
<P>
<P>
</OL><h3>If 3D Pinball's Right Flipper Key Does Not Work</h3>
 
<P>
If you are using a non-U.S. keyboard with Pinball, the right
flipper key will have no default setting and therefore will not
work. To solve this problem:

<OL><P><LI>In 3D Pinball, click Options, and then click Player Controls.

<P><LI>Change the Right Flipper setting to specify the key you want
   to use.
