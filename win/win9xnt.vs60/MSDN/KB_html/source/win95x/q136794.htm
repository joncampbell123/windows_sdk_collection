<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you upgrade to Windows 95 on a computer that is running the Novell
NetWare VLM client, Setup automatically replaces the Novell NetWare client
with the Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks if you choose to perform a
Typical Setup. If you then replace the Microsoft Client for NetWare
Networks with the Novell NetWare client, your computer may stop responding
(hang) when you restart the computer.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The line that loads Smcpwr.com has not been removed from the Startnet.bat
file. This line is not removed when you install the Microsoft Client for
NetWare Networks during Setup, and then later install the Novell NetWare
client. If you choose to perform a Custom Setup and indicate that you want
to use the Novell NetWare client instead of the Microsoft Client for
NetWare Networks, the line is removed and this problem does not occur.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Remove the line that loads Smcpwr.com from the Startnet.bat file.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you perform a Custom Setup and choose the Novell NetWare client, the
line that loads Smcpwr.com remains in the Startnet.bat file until Windows
95 starts for the first time. At that time, the line that loads Smcpwr.com
is removed from the Startnet.bat file, and a line loading Dc21x4.com is
added.
