<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you try to map a drive to a Novell NetWare server, you may receive
the following message:
<P>
<PRE>   Before you can connect to another server, you must detach from one
   or more of the listed servers.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks defaults to a maximum of eight
mapped NetWare servers.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this behavior, use one of the following methods:
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1</h3>
 
<P>
Connect to the server using a Universal Naming Convention name. This
bypasses the default connection limit because UNC connections do not use
drive letters.
<P>
Click the Start button, click Run, and then type "\\&lt;server&gt;\&lt;share&gt;"
(without quotation marks) in the Open box, where &lt;server&gt; is the server
name and &lt;share&gt; is the name of the share on the server.
<P>
This is a "manual" connection that does not remain mapped to the server
when you restart the computer.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 2</h3>
 
<P>
Change or add the "CONNECTIONS=" line in the Net.cfg file. A default
value of 8 is used if there is no "CONNECTIONS=" entry in the Net.cfg
file. Add this line with a value of up to 50, or change the line to a
value of up to 50. Then, remove the network components in Windows 95.
Restart your computer and reinstall the network components. After you
reinstall the network components you should be able to map as many drives
as the value in the "CONNECTIONS=" line in the Net.cfg file.
<P>
The Net.cfg file is a NetWare support file. This file is not included with
Windows 95.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The default maximum number of server connections that NetWare 3.1x allows
is eight. The Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks uses the same default
value. This restriction does not affect the number of drives that can be
mapped. It affects only the number of servers you can map a drive to.
