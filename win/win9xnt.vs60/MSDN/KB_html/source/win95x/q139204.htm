The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you are using a parallel port that is configured for extended
capabilities port (ECP) mode, you may be unable to print to a printer
that is connected to the port, or to use a connection made with Direct
Cable Connection that uses the port. The print job may seem to be printed
correctly, or the data may seem to be transferred correctly, but some of
the data sent to the port may be damaged.
<P>
This problem is known to occur with ECP ports that use an SMC chip set.
The following computers are known to contain ECP ports with the SMC
chip set:

<UL><LI>Hewlett-Packard (HP) Vectra
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem can occur if the ECP port is not properly initialized. Many
ECP ports with the SMC chip set are not properly initialized when the
computer is started.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this problem, use any one of the following methods:

<UL><LI>Configure the parallel port so that it is not in ECP mode. For
   information about how to do so, please consult the computer's
   documentation or manufacturer.

<LI>Use the SMC Setup disk included with your computer to reconfigure
   the ECP port so that it is properly initialized when you start the
   computer. To obtain the SMC Setup disk, or for information about
   how to use the disk to configure the ECP port, please consult
   the computer's manufacturer.

<LI>Obtain a newer version of the SMC chip set that resolves this
   problem from the computer's manufacturer.
