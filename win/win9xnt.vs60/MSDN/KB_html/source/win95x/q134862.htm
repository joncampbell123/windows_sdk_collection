The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you create a new compressed drive, or mount an existing compressed
drive, on a non-removable media drive, and you then perform an operation
that causes Windows 95 to restart, the compressed drive is not mounted
after Windows 95 restarts. If you restart the computer, the compressed
drive is mounted.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The protected-mode DriveSpace driver automatically mounts only compressed
drives located on the following media:

<UL><LI>Removable media drives.

<LI>Drives that cannot be accessed in real mode (for example, PCMCIA hard
   disks for which protected-mode drivers are loaded).

<LI>Drives that were originally mounted by the real-mode DriveSpace
   driver as the computer booted.
<P>
</UL>The new or existing compressed drive was not mounted by the real-mode
DriveSpace driver when the computer started, so it is not automatically
mounted by the protected-mode DriveSpace driver as Windows 95 restarts.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To mount the compressed drive, restart the computer.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
A compressed drive that is located on a non-removable media drive is
typically first mounted by the real-mode DriveSpace driver as the computer
starts. As Windows 95 starts, the protected-mode DriveSpace driver
inherits the currently mounted compressed drives, and automatically mounts
any removable media or protected-mode-only drives currently in the system.
