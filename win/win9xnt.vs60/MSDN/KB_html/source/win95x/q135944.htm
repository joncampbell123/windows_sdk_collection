<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you are installing a Windows-based program that uses Great Lakes
Software's WISE Setup Toolkit, you may receive a general protection (GP)
fault error message, or an invalid page fault error message.
<P>
The following sample error message was encountered installing NavCIS
version 1.62 for Windows:
<P>
<PRE>   INSTALL caused a general protection fault in module ~GLC1164.TMP
   at 0002:00000f0c.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
These errors are caused by a problem in the WISE Setup Toolkit version
3.0g and earlier. The errors seem to occur more frequently if you are
using System Agent, but may occur even if you are not using System Agent.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
You may be able to work around this problem by temporarily disabling
System Agent. To disable System Agent and install your program, follow
these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Programs, point to Accessories,
   point to System Tools, and then click System Agent.

<P><LI>On the Advanced menu, click Stop Using System Agent.

<P><LI>When you are prompted to confirm that you want to stop using System
   Agent, click Yes.

<P><LI>Install your program following the instructions included with that
   program.

<P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Programs, point to Accessories,
   point to System Tools, and then click System Agent.

<P><LI>When you are prompted whether you want to run System Agent, click
   Yes.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: It has been reported that this problem is fixed in version 3.0h of
the WISE Setup Toolkit. You may want to contact your software vendor to
inquire about obtaining a version of your program that uses the updated
toolkit.
