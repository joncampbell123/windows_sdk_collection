The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
<LI>Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release versions 2, 2.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you try to start a program in Windows 95, you may receive one of the
following error messages:

<UL><LI>Error starting program. The Comdlg32.dll file cannot start. Check the
   file to determine the problem.

<LI>Error starting program. The Shell32.dll file cannot start. Check the
   file to determine the problem.

<LI>Error starting program. The Lz32.dll file cannot start. Check the file
   to determine the problem.

<LI>Error starting program. The Version.dll file cannot start. Check the
   file to determine the problem.

<LI>Error starting program. The Winmm.dll file cannot start. Check the
   file to determine the problem.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Some programs replace Windows 95 files with their own files. The Windows
95 Commdlg.dll, Shell.dll, Lzexpand.dll, Ver.dll, or Mmsystem.dll file may
have been replaced by a file from another program.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
You should replace the file listed in the error message you received. In
the instructions that follow, replace &lt;name&gt; with the name of the
appropriate file. This file will be one of the following files:

<UL><LI>Commdlg.dll
<LI>Shell.dll
<LI>Lzexpand.dll
<LI>Ver.dll
<LI>Mmsystem.dll
<P>
</UL>Restart your computer to a command prompt, and then copy the &lt;name&gt; file
from the Windows\Sysbckup folder to the Windows\System folder. This
replaces the existing file with the Windows 95 version of the file.
<P>
NOTE: The program that replaced the &lt;name&gt; file with another version of
the file may have set some of the &lt;name&gt; file's attributes. If you are
having trouble copying the file from the Windows\Sysbckup folder to the
Windows\System folder, use Windows Explorer to check the &lt;name&gt; file's
properties. If the file's Read-Only, Hidden, or System properties are
selected, click those check boxes to clear them.
<P>
If the &lt;name&gt; file in the Windows\Sysbckup folder is damaged or is not the
correct version of the file, extract a new version of the file from your
original Windows 95 disks or CD-ROM to the Windows\System folder. To
extract a new copy of the &lt;name&gt; file, you need to perform one of the
following steps, depending on the file:

<UL><LI>Extract the Commdlg.new file from the Win95_11.cab file to the
   Windows\System folder, and then rename the Commdlg.new file to
   Commdlg.dll.

<LI>Extract the Shell.new file from the Win95_11.cab file to the
   Windows\System folder, and then rename the Shell.new file to Shell.dll.

<LI>Extract the Lzexpand.dll file from the Precopy1.cab file to the
   Windows\System folder.

<LI>Extract the Ver.new file from the Win95_17.cab file to the
   Windows\System folder, and then rename the Ver.new file to Ver.dll.

<LI>Extract the Mmsystem.dll file from the Win95_13.cab file to the
   Windows\System folder.
<P>
</UL>Note: The specific cabinet file numbers may vary from version to version.
Use the /A switch to search the entire cabinet set of the appropriate type
(Precopy or Win95).
