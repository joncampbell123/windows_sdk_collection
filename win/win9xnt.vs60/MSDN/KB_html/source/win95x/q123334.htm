The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
There are two requirements for animated cursors in Windows 95:

<UL><LI>Protected-mode disk drivers

<LI>A Windows 95-compatible display driver that meets the specifications
   described below
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Disk Drivers</h3>
 
<P>
To use animated cursors in Windows 95, you must use protected-mode disk
drivers. Protected-mode disk drivers are necessary because animated
cursors require large amounts of page-locked memory (approximately 250
kilobytes). By using protected-mode drivers, this memory can be moveable.
If Windows 95 allowed you to use animated cursors with real-mode disk
drivers, you might not have enough memory to run your applications. If you
use real-mode drivers, your cursors are in color (but not animated) as
long as the Windows API call GetWinFlags() returns WF_DOSPAGING. Animated
cursors will not be animated if they cannot perform SmartPageLocks or
SmartPageUnlocks. The real-mode mapper prevents this.
<P>
Perform the following steps to determine if you are using protected-mode
disk drivers:

<OL><P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

<P><LI>Double-click the System icon.

<P><LI>Click Performance. If you are using protected-mode disk drivers the
   File System entry should read "32-bit."

<P><LI>If the File System entry reads "Some drives are using MS-DOS
   compatibility," click an item and then click Detail for more
   information about which drives are using MS-DOS compatibility mode.
<P>
   For information about troubleshooting MS-DOS Compatibility mode on hard
   disks, see the following articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

<PRE></PRE>      TITLE     : Troubleshooting MS-DOS Compatibility Mode on Hard Disks

      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../zmiscellaneous/q138899.htm">Q138899</A></B>
      TITLE     : Description of the Ios.log File

</PRE></OL><h3>Display Driver</h3>
 
<P>
To use animated cursors in Windows 95, you must also have a Windows 95-
compatible display driver that uses the device-independent bitmap (DIB)
engine and meets at least one of the following criteria:

<UL><LI>The display driver must run at 8 bits per pixel (bpp) or higher and
   support color cursors.
<P>
   NOTE: 256 colors = 8 bpp
<P>
   -or-

<LI>The display driver must allow Windows 95 to access its memory in a
   linear fashion (such as through a frame buffer). This allows for
   smoother animation because Windows gains entrance to the driver during
   interrupt time.
<P>
</UL>The following are examples of display drivers that do not support animated
cursors:

<UL><LI>ATI Ultra (mach8)
   This driver does not support a frame buffer.

<LI>Diamond Viper
   This driver is based on the Windows 3.1 video standard.

<LI>Standard Display Adapter (VGA)
   This driver is based on a standard established prior to the
   development of animated cursors.

<LI>Super VGA
   This driver is based on a standard established prior to the
   development of animated cursors.
<P>
</UL>If your system meets the requirements described in this article but you
still cannot use animated cursors, scan your computer for viruses.
Boot-sector viruses can prevent animated cursors from being available.
