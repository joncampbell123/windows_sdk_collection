The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, you should first make a backup copy of the
registry files (System.dat and User.dat). Both are hidden files in the
Windows folder.
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use System Policy Editor to have a program run once by placing
it in the RunOnce registry key on the default computer or a particular
computer, the program may run every time a user logs on.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
With system policies, every time a user logs on to a computer the policy
file is downloaded and added to the registry. Therefore, the value is
always placed in the RunOnce key at startup.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall Windows 95. Microsoft cannot guarantee
that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be
solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
NOTE: For information about how to edit the registry, view the Changing
Keys And Values online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Note
that you should make a backup copy of the registry files (System.dat and
User.dat) before you edit the registry.
<P>
To cause a program to run only once, use one of the following methods:

<UL><LI>Use Remote Registry to open each computer's registry file, and place
   the program in the RunOnce key.

<LI>Create an initial policy file with the RunOnce key enabled. After users
   have downloaded the change, edit the policy file to remove the RunOnce
   entry.

<LI>Export and send the registry entry to users in e-mail. Users can
   double-click the .reg file to add the key to their registry. The
   program runs the next time the computer is started.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The RunOnce key is designed to cause a value to be executed only one time.
When you select the RunOnce key in System Policy Editor, the value you add
is placed under the following registry keys:

<UL><LI>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce,

<LI>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce
<P>
</UL>With system policies, every time a user logs on to a computer the policy
file is downloaded and added to the registry. Therefore, the value is
always placed in the RunOnce key at startup.
