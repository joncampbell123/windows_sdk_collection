The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you are running the "File and printer sharing for NetWare Networks"
network service, Net Watcher reports that another computer is still
connected to your computer, even though the other computer has disconnected
from your computer. Quitting and restarting Net Watcher, or pressing the F5
key to refresh the display, does not eliminate the problem.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Even after the other computer has disconnected, a low-level connection
exists between the two computers. Net Watcher is reporting that this low-
level connection exists.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To completely disconnect the other computer from your computer so that the
connection is not shown in Net Watcher, use either of the following
methods:

<UL><LI>In Net Watcher, click the computer you want to disconnect, then click
   Disconnect User on the Administer menu.

<LI>Quit and then restart Windows 95.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
A client computer connected to a Windows 95 computer that is running the
"File and printer sharing for NetWare Networks" network service generally
uses the same connection for all processes that need access to the Windows
95 computer. Therefore, disconnecting a single network drive does not break
this single connection to the remote server. The connection remains and is
visible in Net Watcher until the local connection table on the remote
server is full.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
