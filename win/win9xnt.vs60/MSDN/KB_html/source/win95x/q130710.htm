The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, you should first make a backup copy of the
registry files (System.dat and User.dat). Both are hidden files in the
Windows folder.
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you try to access a file on a NetWare 3.11 server from a Windows 95-
based computer using the Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks, you may
receive one of the following error messages:

<UL><LI>File not accessible

<LI>File not found

<LI>Sharing violation
<P>
</UL>You may also receive an error message from the program that you are using
to access the file, indicating that the file has already been opened by
another user.
<P>
When you send a message from Microsoft Exchange, if the post office is
located on a Novell 3.11 server, you may receive the following error
message:
<P>
<PRE>   The message recipients mailbag does not exist or is busy. Contact
   your administrator.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
These errors occur when a File Open request is sent to a NetWare 3.11
server but the client does not properly receive a "file open success"
message. This causes the File Open request to be repeated. Under normal
circumstances, the server would resend the "file open success" message to
the client. However, the server returns a "file already open" failure
message to the client instead. This error occurs only when you are opening
a file on a NetWare 3.11 server with the OS/2 namespace module loaded on
the server and long file name support enabled on the client. Therefore,
the error does not occur when you are using a Novell work-station shell
(NETX or VLM).
<P>
Note that this error does not occur on NetWare version 3.12 or higher
servers.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Once the file has been left open on the server, it must be closed to
resolve the error. To prevent the error from occurring, use one of the
following methods:

<UL><LI>Use a Novell workstation shell (NETX or VLM) instead of the
   Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks.

<LI>Disable long filename support on the client by modifying the SYSTEM.INI
   file or editing the registry.

<LI>Obtain the OS2OPNFX.NLM patch for the Novell 3.11 server from Novell.
   For more information about this patch, please refer to the Windows 95
   Beta Release Notes, or contact Novell.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To disable long filename support on the Microsoft Client for NetWare
Networks, use either of the following methods:

<UL><LI>Add the following two lines to the SYSTEM.INI file:
<P>
<P><PRE>      [NWRedir]
      supportLFN=0
</PRE>
<LI>Edit the following key in the registry:
<P>
<P><PRE>      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\VxD\NWREDIR
</PRE><P>
   Add a binary value called supportlfn with a value of 0 to the key. The
   allowable values are 0 (do not support long filenames) and 1
   (support long filenames when available). The default value is 1.
<P>
</UL>For information about how to edit the registry, view the Changing Keys And
Values online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Note that you
should make a backup copy of the registry files (System.dat and User.dat)
before you edit the registry.
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall Windows 95. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved.
Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
