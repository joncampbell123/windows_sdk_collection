The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The General tab in Mouse properties may indicate that a PS/2-style mouse
is installed, even though you are using a serial mouse.
<P>
When this occurs, the PS/2 mouse port is displayed with an exclamation
point in a yellow circle in Device Manager.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior can occur if your computer has a PS/2 mouse port, but you
are using a mouse connected to a serial port. The PS/2 mouse port is the
first mouse port displayed in Device Manager, so the PS/2 mouse is
displayed as the installed device in Mouse properties.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To correctly configure the mouse settings, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Disable the PS/2 mouse port in your computer's CMOS settings. For
   information about how to do so, please consult your computer's
   documentation or manufacturer.
<P>
   NOTES:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - This may not work if your computer is a Plug and Play system, as
      the PS/2 mouse port will be redetected and reenabled the next time
      you start Windows 95.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - On some older computers, disabling the PS/2 mouse port may not be
      an option in the CMOS settings. Instead, there may be a jumper on
      the motherboard to disable the port. Consult the computer's
      documentation or manufacturer if you are not sure how to disable
      the port.
</PRE>
<P><LI>In Control Panel, double-click the System icon.

<P><LI>On the Device Manager tab, click Standard PS/2 Port Mouse, and then
   click Properties.

<P><LI>Click the Original Configuration (Current) check box to clear it,
   and then click OK.
<P>
</OL>If you decide later to use the PS/2 mouse port, reenable the port in your
computer's CMOS settings, and then run the Add New Hardware Wizard to
redetect it in Windows 95.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Some Plug and Play motherboards may actually have pinholes for a PS/2
mouse port but have no PS/2 mouse port installed. In some cases, there
may be no CMOS settings or jumpers to disable the PS/2 mouse port. If
this is the case, following steps 2-4 above may resolve the situation.
