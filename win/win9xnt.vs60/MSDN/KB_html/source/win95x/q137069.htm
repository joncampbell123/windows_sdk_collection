The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
You may experience the following symptoms:

<UL><LI>When you add a new icon to the desktop, the icon may seem to disappear
   if the desktop already has a large number of icons.
<P>
   Although you cannot see the icon, you can find it using the Find tool,
   and it appears in the Desktop folder.

<LI>When you move an icon from one location on the desktop to another, the
   icon returns to its original location.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Disappearing Icons</h3>
 
<P>
This behavior can occur if you are using the Auto Arrange option for icons
on the desktop. When there are too many icons on the desktop to be
displayed without overlapping, icons may be placed off the visible portion
of the screen.
<P>
<P><h3>Cannot Move Icons</h3>
 
<P>
This behavior can occur if you are using the Auto Arrange option for icons
on the desktop.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Disappearing Icons</h3>
 
<P>
To work around this behavior, use any of the following methods:

<UL><LI>Create one or more folders on the desktop, and then drag icons from
   the desktop into a folder until all the remaining icons on the desktop
   are visible.

<LI>Use the Find tool to locate a missing icon and then drag it to
   another location, such as a new folder on the desktop.

<LI>Use a higher screen resolution, so you can see more of the desktop.
<P>
   NOTE: Your video card and monitor must be capable of supporting a
   higher resolution.

<LI>Adjust the icon spacing on the desktop. To do so, adjust the Icon
   Spacing (Vertical) and Icon Spacing (Horizontal) items on the
   Appearance tab in Display properties.

<LI>Turn off the Auto Arrange option for icons on the desktop, and then
   place icons on the desktop where you want them.
<P>
</UL><h3>Cannot Move Icons</h3>
 
<P>
Turn off the Auto Arrange option for icons on the desktop, and then place
icons on the desktop where you want them.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Disappearing Icons</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95. We
are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h3>Cannot Move Icons</h3>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Note that you cannot use the Find tool to drag or copy a desktop icon to
another location on the desktop. You must move it to a new location.
