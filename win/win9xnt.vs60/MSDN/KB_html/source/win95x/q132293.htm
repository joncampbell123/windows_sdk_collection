<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you are using Windows 95 on a computer with a DATABOOk PCMCIA
controller and two network adapters installed, Windows 95 may stop
responding (hang) when you start the computer or "hot swap" the network
adapters.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The DATABOOK PCMCIA controller does not handle bus contention on its
card slots properly when two network adapters are installed and network
traffic is high.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
The first network adapter's lites must go out to enumerate the second
device off the controller. This may not happen on a busy network. If the
lites do not go out, remove the second apapter to prevent Windows 95 from
hanging.
<P>
NOTE: Do not unplug the cable, as you might not be able to re-establish the
connection when you plug the cable back in.
<P>
Contact DATABOOK for more information.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
According to DATABOOK, when you insert two network adapters into the
PCMCIA slots, the first adapter is initialized by the controller and
activated, but you cannot insert the second adapter until the first
adapter's lights go out. On a busy network where the first adapter is
constantly in use, the controller may hang when you insert the second
adapter, causing Windows 95 to hang when you start Windows 95 or when
you "hot swap" a network adapter.
