<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article contains questions and answers about multimedia in Windows 95.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 

<OL><P><LI> Q. My sound card is supported by Windows 95, but Setup did not detect
<P><PRE>       it. How do I install it?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. Use the Add New Hardware tool in Control Panel. If the sound card
       is not detected, make sure its real-mode drivers are loading in the
       Config.sys and Autoexec.bat files before you run the Add New
       Hardware Wizard again.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       If Windows 95 still does not detect the sound card, there may be a
       conflict between the sound card and another device. Use the right
       mouse button to click My Computer, click Properties on the menu that
       appears, then click the Device Manager tab. Examine the properties
       for each device to see if Windows 95 reports a device conflict. Once
       any device conflict is resolved, run the Add New Hardware Wizard
       again.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. Windows 95 does not have a driver for my sound card. How do I use it
<P><PRE>       in Windows 95?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. To use your sound card in Windows 95, install its Windows 3.1
       drivers. You may also want to contact your sound card manufacturer
       about Windows 95 driver availability.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       If the sound card driver files include an Oemsetup.inf file, use the
       following steps to install the driver:
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, then click Control
<PRE></PRE>          Panel.

       2. Double-click the Add New Hardware icon, then click Next.

       3. When you are prompted "Do you want Windows to search for your
          new hardware?" click No, then click Next.

       4. In the Hardware Types box, click Sound, Video And Game
          Controllers, then click Next.

       5. Click the Have Disk button to install the sound card driver.

       If the sound card driver files do not include an Oemsetup.inf file,
       use the sound card's Setup program to install it. If there is no
       Setup program, contact the manufacturer for assistance.

</PRE><P><LI> Q. The sound from my Creative Labs SoundBlaster sound card is
<P><PRE>       scratchy. How do I fix it?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. This problem can occur when the SoundBlaster's DMA setting does not
       match its DMA setting in Windows 95. To correct this, follow these
       steps:
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       1. Use the right mouse button to click My Computer, then click
<PRE></PRE>          Properties on the menu that appears.

       2. On the Device Manager tab, click Sound, Video And Game
          Controllers, then click Remove. When you are prompted to restart
          your computer, click Yes.

       3. Click the Start button, point to Settings, then click Control
          Panel.

       4. Double-click the Add New Hardware icon, click Next, then click
          Next again.

       5. Restart your computer when the Add New Hardware Wizard finishes.

</PRE><P><LI> Q. When I play .avi files they don't seem to play smoothly. How can I
<P><PRE>       correct this?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. Try the following tips to smooth out .avi file playback:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>        - Do not run the file over a network.

        - If you are playing the file from a CD-ROM, and the CD-ROM drive
          uses protected-mode drivers, use the following steps to increase
          the size of the CD-ROM cache:

          1. Use the right mouse button to click My Computer, then click
             Properties on the menu that appears.

          2. On the Performance tab, click File System, then click the
             CD-ROM tab.

        - If the CD-ROM drive uses real-mode drivers, load SMARTDrive in
          the Autoexec.bat file.

        - For additional information, please see the following article
          in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

             TITLE     : Troubleshooting Video Problems in Windows 95

</PRE><P><LI> Q. Why does Windows 95 not detect my SCSI CD-ROM drive?
<P>
<P><PRE>    A. Windows 95 detects only proprietary CD-ROM drives (such as
       Panasonic, Mitsumi, and Sony CD-ROM drives). Although Windows 95
       does not detect CD-ROM drives on SCSI controllers, it does detect
       supported SCSI controllers. Your SCSI CD-ROM drive is accessible
       because the enumerator for the SCSI controller also enumerates the
       CD-ROM drive.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. Does Media Player support MPEG?
<P>
<P><PRE>    A. No. Windows 95 does not include an MPEG driver for Media Player.
       However, there are third-party products you can use to view MPEG
       files in Windows 95.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. Some of the sounds played by my sound card sound fine, and others
<P><PRE>       sound scratchy. How can I correct this?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. Try the following tips to improve the sound playback:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>        - Make sure you are using the proper DMA settings. Some sound
          cards use a High and a Low DMA setting.

        - Make sure the format of the wave file is supported by your sound
          card. For example, you cannot play a 16-bit wave file on an
          8-bit sound card.

</PRE><P><LI> Q. My program that uses QuickTime does not work properly. What can I
<P><PRE>       do to fix this?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. Make sure there is only one version of QuickTime on your computer.
       If you continue to have problems, add the line "optimize=driver" to
       the [Video] section of the Qtw.ini file in the Windows folder and
       then restart your computer.
