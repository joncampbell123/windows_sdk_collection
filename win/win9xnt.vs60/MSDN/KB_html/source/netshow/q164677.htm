The information in this article applies to:
<P>
<PRE>  - Microsoft NetShow versions 1.0 and 2.0
</PRE> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Some XIRCOM CreditCard Ethernet Adapter IIps (CE2) PCMCIA network adapter
drivers may not support IP Multicast. The original release of drivers 
for this device do not support IP Multicasting.
<P>
When you try to use NetShow 1.0 to receive Live Audio or File transfers
that uses IP Multicast Only (UDP), you may not hear any audio or fail 
to receive the file transfer even though the Server is functioning 
normally for other clients.
<P>
In version 2.0, you also may not be able to receive Multicasts. This may
not be apparent if the NetShow stream is set to fail over to a unicast 
(TCP) stream.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
There are a couple of ways to determine if you may have this problem:

<UL><LI>If your XIRCOM IIps adapter has a gold stripe across the top of the
   adapter, you have an older model and may need to get newer drivers
   from XIRCOM. If it has a black strip across the top, you have a 
   newer model, and it should support IP Multicast.

<LI>If you are using Microsoft Windows 95 and using the original
   vendor-provided driver, you will need to get a newer driver. The
   driver is dated 7/11/95 and named Ce2ndis3.vxd. If you check the 
   name of the driver under Network Properties, the driver that 
   supports IP Multicast has the following name:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Xircom CE-IIps CreditCard Ethernet Adapter (XPS driver)
</PRE>
<LI>In NetShow version 2.0, you can check the stream type by doing 
   the following:
<P>
   1. Play a NetShow stream.
<P>
   2. While the stream is playing, right-click the Control Bar of 
<P><PRE>      the Player Control, and click Properties.
</PRE><P>
   3. Select the Details tab and look at the SourceLink. If it is 
<P><PRE>      using an MMS: broadcast, then you are receiving the stream 
      via unicast (TCP). If this source line property indicates 
      Multicast, you have updated drivers that support 
      IP Multicasting.
</PRE><P>
</UL>NOTE: Just because the SourceLink is using an unicast (MMS:) stream
does not indicate you have a problem. The server can be set to only
stream unicast streams. You need to verify that the stream is set to
multicast either at the server or with another client using a 
different network adapter.
