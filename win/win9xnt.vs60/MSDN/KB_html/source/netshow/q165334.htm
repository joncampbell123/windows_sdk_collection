The information in this article applies to:
<P>
<PRE>  - Microsoft NetShow version 2.0
</PRE> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you try to multicast and view an ASX link, you get an error 
message that there is a bad or missing channel file URL.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The above problem is most often caused by an invalid path for the 
channel file URL when you create the channel.
<P>
If you are using a proxy server that requires authentication, you 
will get the above error message. This is because the HTTP browser can
authenticate with the proxy by the NetShow control. However, it 
cannot use either Basic or Microsoft Windows NT Challenge Response 
authentication.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Check that the path listed in the channel is the proper path to the 
channel file (.NSC file) and re-export the channel file.
<P>
You must also ensure that when you host the NSC file from a file server,
that the user also has access to this file. If this file is being hosted
from an HTTP server, you must allow anonymous access to this file.
<P>
You can test the server for anonymous access by using the client to open
an HTTP location to an ASX file. If this is successful, make sure the 
NSC file is also allowing anonymous access by disabling the other 
authentication methods or checking the HTTP server log files.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Below are some quick notes on anonymous user access on an IIS webserver:

<UL><LI>In the Microsoft Internet Service Manager, open the WWW Service
   Properties.

<LI>Verify the Anonymous Logon Username and Password.

<LI>Verify the username and password in the WWW Service Properties has
   an identical username and password used in User Manager.

<LI>Run User Manager to verify the local logon rights for your designated
   anonymous user.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Run the Microsoft Internet Service Manager to change your anonymous
   logon user to an account that does have local logon rights. Verify
   the same username and password as used in User Manager.
