The information in this article applies to:

<LI>Microsoft NT Workstation version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft NT Server version 4.0
</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Some versions of the Sound Blaster Sound Card drivers either do not work
or produce a hissing, buzzing, or scratching sound when playing
compressed audio. This article provides instructions to test, and if
necessary, update your sound card driver.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Some drivers for Sound Blaster cards may not perform well with sound codecs
that use compression. Because NetShow uses such codecs, you should first
test your system's sound by playing a sound file that has been compressed
before you install and run NetShow.
<P>
Use Sound Recorder to test your system. If the sound is not satisfactory,
replace your current driver with one of those included on your Windows NT
4.0 distribution disc. For more information, see "Changing Your Sound
Blaster Driver" later in this document.
<P>
To Test Your System's Sound
 

<OL><P><LI>Click Start, and point to Programs, and then point to Accessories, and
   then point to then Multimedia, and then click Sound Recorder.

<P><LI>On the File menu in Sound Recorder, click Open and browse for a sound
   (.wav) file to open and use in your test. For example, you can use the
   Windows NT Logon Sound located in the Media subdirectory of your Windows
   NT directory.

<P><LI>Select a sound file and click Open.

<P><LI>Click the Play button in Sound Recorder to make sure that your system
   is playing sound normally.

<P><LI>On the File menu in Sound Recorder, click Properties.

<P><LI>On the Details tab, click Convert Now. The Sound Selection dialog box
   is displayed.

<P><LI>In the Format box, select Microsoft ADPCM, and then click OK. The system
   compresses the .wav file you selected.

<P><LI>In the Properties dialog box, click OK.

<P><LI>In the Sound Recorder dialog box, click the play button. The sound
   should play cleanly. If it does not, you must change the driver for your
   sound card.

<P><LI>To close Sound Recorder, click Exit on the File menu.

<P><LI>Sound Recorder displays a message explaining that the .wav file you
   used has been changed. Click No to avoid saving the changes.
<P>
</OL><h3>Changing Your Sound Blaster Driver</h3>
 
<P>
If, after checking your system's sound, you need to replace your sound
driver because there is a hissing, buzzing, or scratching sound when
playing compressed audio, use the appropriate driver from your Windows NT
4.0 compact disc. Both standard and plug-and-play drivers are available.
To change drivers, you must be logged on to your computer with
Administrator privileges.
<P>
In order to install a new driver, you must first remove the old driver
and restart Windows NT. Before removing the old driver, write down its
settings so that you have them available when installing the new driver.
<P>
<P><h3>To Remove the Current Sound Driver</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>In Windows NT Control Panel, double-click Multimedia.

<P><LI>On the Devices tab, double-click Audio Devices, select your current
   Sound Blaster driver and click Properties.
