The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft NetShow version 2.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft NetShow version 2.0 has two types of ASX files: 
machine-generated files and hand crafted ASX files.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The machine-generated files are encrypted, and they will allow 
you to publish an announcement that will support multicast. They 
are generated in the NetShow Program Manager and are created by 
right clicking an existing NetShow program and selecting Announce. 
<P>
This will create an ASX file that you can
<P>
<PRE>  - Link to in the stand-alone player
  - Use with an embedded object on a HTML document
  - Use with a anchor tag in a HTML document
  - Distribute as appropriate. 

</PRE>NOTE: If you want to Multicast, you need to use machine-generated 
ASX files that are created from the Program Manager.
<P>
If you are using a Unicast distribution, then you can create 
your ASX file manually using the information below, as appropriate.
<P>
ANATOMY of a V2 ASX file. (This is one example.)  
<P>
[Reference]
<PRE>Ref1=mms://nclib/sample.asf           &lt;- This is the first 
                                         reference to try.
</PRE>ref2=<B>http://nclib/asfroot/sample.asf</B>  &lt;- This is the second server 
<PRE>                                         to try
BaseURL = <B>http://nclib/content/</B>       &lt;- This is the Base URL for 
                                         relative references in
                                         the ASF stream to use as 
                                         a base path.

[Description]                         &lt;- Descriptive Information 
                                         displayed in the browser
Program Title=Sample ASX File         &lt;- The Program Title displayed
                                         in the browser
Program Description=stuff	      &lt;- The Program Description displayed in the browser
Program Author=scott                  &lt;- The Program Author displayed
                                         in the browser
Program Copyright=other stuff         &lt;- The Program Copyright 
                                         displayed in the browser

</PRE>You do not need ref1 and ref2 if the virtual path is the same 
for both protocols. For example, if you had HTTP streaming enabled
on the NetShow server or had a WWW virtual root that was the same,
the first REF1 would be enough with the protocol rollover feature
of version 2 NetShow clients.
