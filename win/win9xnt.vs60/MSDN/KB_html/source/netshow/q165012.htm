The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft NetShow version 2.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The section below discusses how you get started with a live broadcast
from a NetShow server.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If you look in the NetShow product documentation, you will find what
you need to see example usage and configuration scenarios. You will 
want to look in the NetShow Administrator Getting Started page; 
click the option to learn about the many examples you can implement 
with NetShow. You can use the examples step-by-step guides and the 
wizards to set up NetShow.
<P>
If you are doing an Internet broadcast, you will probably not need 
to set up a channel or program. In the Internet example, you will 
need to set up the real time encoder and a Unicast Publishing Point
(Alias) pulling the feed from the real Time Encoder using a fixed 
port.
<P>
If you are doing an intranet broadcast, you will want to set up a 
channel to do the multicast broadcast. Therefore, you must set up the 
routers and switches on the corporate network so that they support
multicast and are enabled for multicast routing.
<P>
The following is the recommended Internet configuration using the 
Unicast Server.

<UL><LI>Setup Real Time Encoder (REX) to operate on a fixed port. You 
   can use 5005; however, this is just one in a large valid range.

<LI>Start this Encoder Session.

<LI>On server, use Administration Page to add a stream to an URL-based
   media

<LI>Use something similar to the following:
<PRE>      Name   := Live
      Path   := msbd://EncoderNameorIP:Port

</PRE></UL>Then on your web server, create the following ASX file.
<P>
NOTE: Use a DOS/Windows-based text editor such as Notepad. In some 
cases if you use a UNIX editor, you will not get the LF/CR combination
at the end of lines and will create a malformed ASX file.
<P>
Save the file in the WWWRoot directory as Livedemo.asx.
[Reference]
ref1=mms://NetShowServerNameOrIP/Live
<P>
Then you could use in the NetShow Player or link via HTML to the 
following paths:
<P>
NetShow Player (this will verify the feed coming from the server)
mms://NetShowServerNameOrIP/Live
<P>
NetShow Player (for testing this will verify the feed coming 
from the Encoder)
msbd://EncoderNameorIP:Port
<P>
In the Player or in HTML source or in a Web browser (this will 
verify the server and the ASX file)
http: //WWWServerNameOrIP/LiveDemo.asx
<P>
This will create a feed appropriate for Internet distribution. 
If you need multicast or distribution capabilities, you will need
and want to set up a channel and program. First, you will want 
to set up a channel using the Channel Wizard. Next, you will need
to create a new program stream in the Manage Programs page.
<P>
From a new program, create a new stream (ASF stream) and for the
URL use msbd://EncoderNameorIP:Port. Then you will need to 
announce the program by right-clicking the program and clicking
Announce. Save this ASX file in the WWWROOT directory
(<B>http://WWWServerNameOrIP/AnnouncementFileName.asx).</B>
<P>
NOTE You will want to make sure your program starts playing, and 
You have green arrows on both the program and at least one stream 
as you can add multiple streams to a program.
