<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes the requirements for implementing Microsoft NetShow
version 1.0 On-Demand in conjunction with a firewall or proxy server.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft NetShow uses several different protocols. This article describes
the requirements for streaming NetShow 1.0 content through a firewall or
proxy server. NetShow content can only be streamed using TCP/IP. This
article also discusses the requirements when configuring a Firewall to
allow free passage of these IP frames for both servers and clients. There
may be additional requirements for implementations of future versions of
NetShow. Check current product documentation or the Microsoft Knowledge
Base for future requirements.
<P>
Firewalls are administered by corporations to prevent unauthorized access
to corporate networks. Most firewalls are based on packet filtering. Packet
filtering takes place when the computer examines the source and destination
IP addresses of a packet and forwards only those packets that have been
granted access.
<P>
The On-Demand content streaming from NetShow will currently stream through
a number of firewalls and we are working with several additional vendors
for support in their products. For the most recent list of supported
vendors, point your browser to the following URL:
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/netshow/firewall.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/netshow/firewall.htm</A></B>

</PRE>If your firewall (or router) vendor is not on this list, it does not mean
you cannot stream NetShow media through your firewall. This is a list that
we have tested or worked with the vendor to ensure you will be successful.
The details of configuration are below in this article.
<P>
<P><h3>Conclusion</h3>
 
<P>
There are two protocols in which you can receive an On-Demand stream, HTTP
and MMS (over TCP and UDP).
<P>
If you place a NetShow On-Demand ASF file in a directory available from a
HTTP server you can stream the ASF file via a standard HTTP protocol and
would not need to do any additional configuration of your firewall beyond
the configuration needed for your WEB server. Normally this http
transmission is done over TCP port 80 by default. This can be changed on
most Web servers so you would need to open the appropriate port for your
TCP connections.
<P>
When a NetShow client makes a request from a NetShow server using the MMS
protocol the Initial TCP connection is on port 1755. The server then
streams the content via UDP on a random port requested by the client
between 1024 and 5000.
<P>
When Setting up a NetShow 1.0 On-Demand server by default you will need to
enable the following IP TCP and UDP ports on the Firewall as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   Incoming TCP port 1755
   Outgoing UDP 1024 - 5000

</PRE>If you are using a NetShow client in conjunction with a firewall, you will
need to allow:
<P>
<PRE>   Outgoing TCP on port 1755
   Incomming UDP on port 1024 - 5000

</PRE>You can also configure the proxy server name and port when receiving a HTTP
stream and specify a UDP port for a MMS stream to use. These settings are
found on the advanced tab in the properties of the On-Demand control. When
specifying a UDP port to request in the client you may not need to open the
range of UDP ports and can specify the port to use.
