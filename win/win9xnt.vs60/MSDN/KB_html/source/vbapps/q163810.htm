<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
You can return a list of bookmarks in a document sorted either
alphabetically or by placement. Omitting or including the Range object in
your command will determine that sort order. This article contains examples
for both methods.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>

Microsoft provides examples of Visual Basic for Applications procedures

this article are provided 'as is' and Microsoft does not guarantee that
they can be used in all situations. While Microsoft support engineers can
help explain the functionality of a particular macro, they will not modify
these examples to provide added functionality, nor will they help you
construct macros to meet your specific needs. If you have limited
programming experience, you may want to consult one of the Microsoft
Solution Providers. Solution Providers offer a wide range of fee-based
services, including creating custom macros. For more information about

<P><h3>Method 1: To Return a List of Bookmarks Sorted Alphabetically</h3>
 
<P>
The following macro demonstrates how to return the list of bookmarks in a
document alphabetically. Note that, in this example, the Range object has
been excluded from the ActiveDocument.Bookmarks command line.
<P>
<PRE>   Sub GetBookMarksByName()
      Dim oBookMark As Object
      For Each oBookMark In ActiveDocument.Bookmarks
         MsgBox oBookMark.Name
      Next
   End Sub

</PRE><h3>Method 2: To Return a List of Bookmarks Sorted by Placement</h3>
 
<P>
The following macro demonstrates how to return the list of bookmarks in a
document by order of placement. Note that, in this example, the Range
object is part of the ActiveDocument.Bookmarks command line.
<P>
<PRE>   Sub GetBookMarksByPlacement()
      Dim oBookMark As Object
      For Each oBookMark In ActiveDocument.Range.Bookmarks
         MsgBox oBookMark.Name
      Next
   End Sub

</PRE>For more information about Bookmarks, from the Visual Basic for
Applications Editor, click the Office Assistant, type "Bookmarks," click
Search, and then click to view "Bookmarks Collection."
