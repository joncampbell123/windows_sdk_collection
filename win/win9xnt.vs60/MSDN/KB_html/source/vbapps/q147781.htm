<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multiuser skills.
<P>
Because the architecture of Windows 95 and Windows NT is 32-bit, there
are several differences in the application programming interface (API)
from the 16-bit API of Windows 3.x. This article discusses how to convert
code containing 16-bit API calls to 32-bit API calls so that the code
will run successfully in a 32-bit operating environment. This article
discusses the following topics:

<UL><LI>Why 16-bit API calls do not work in a 32-bit operating environment

<LI>Tips on how to make the conversion process easier

<LI>List of converted declaration statements for common API functions
   that you can copy into your modules.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Why 16-bit API Calls Do Not Work in a 32-bit Operating Environment</h3>
 
<P>
You cannot use a 16-bit API call in the Windows 95 or Windows NT 32-bit
operating environment for the following reasons:

<UL><LI>The API library names (dll) are different, for example:
<P>
<PRE>      16-bit       32-bit
      -------------------------
      User.dll     User32.dll
      Kernel.dll   Kernel32.dll
      GDI.dll      GDI32.dll

</PRE><LI>Parameter data types are often different, for example:
<P>
<PRE>      16-bit       32-bit
      -------------------
      Integer      Long
      Integer      Byte
      Double       Long

   NOTE: This not a complete list. You should watch closely for different
   parameter data types when converting code that makes an API call or
   supplies parameters to an API call.

</PRE><LI>API function names are case-sensitive. This differs from the 16-bit API,
   which is not case-sensitive. For example, in a 16-bit API call, the
   following statements are equivalent:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Declare Function GetVersion Lib "KERNEL" () as Long
      Declare Function gEtVeRsIoN Lib "KERNEL" () as Long
</PRE><P>
   However, when converted to a 32-bit API, these statements are not
   equivalent because the function names are case-sensitive:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Declare Function GetVersion Lib "KERNEL32" () as Long
      Declare Function gEtVeRsIoN Lib "KERNEL32" () as Long
</PRE>
<LI>Some API functions have different versions to accommodate ANSI and
   UniCode strings. If an API listed in this article is limited to use
   under a specific operating system in 32-bit, it will be noted with
   the API function.
<P>
</UL><h3>Tips on How to Make the Conversion Process Easier</h3>
 
<P>
You can reduce the amount of work involved with converting your existing
code by adopting these practices:

<UL><LI>When you declare an API procedure, use an alias for the procedure
   name. The alias must be unique from the function name. If it is not,
   the alias will be deleted automatically.

<LI>When you declare the data type returned by the function or the data
   type of parameters passed to the function, use an As clause rather
   than the type declaration characters (%, $, and so on).
<P>
</UL>There is also a helpful utility included with the Microsoft Access
Developers Toolkit for Windows 95, Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition,
and Visual Basic 4.0 that makes working with APIs easier. It is called the
API Viewer. It enables you to browse through Declares, Constants, and
Types that are included in any text file or in a Microsoft Jet database
that contains API information. You can copy these items to the Clipboard
and then paste them into your code.
<P>
<P><h3>List of Converted Declaration Statements for Common API Functions</h3>
 
<P>
Following is a listing of 16-bit and 32-bit Declare statements for common
API calls that you can use as reference when converting your code to 32-
bit.
<P>
NOTE: If you use any of the following 16-bit declarations in Microsoft
Access 2.0 or earlier, an underscore (_) at the end of a line is used
as a line-continuation character. Remove the underscore from the end of
the line when re-creating these declarations.
<P>
<P><h3>BitBlt</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE> 16-bit: Declare Function BitBlt Lib "GDI" (ByVal hDestDC As Integer, _
         ByVal X As Integer, ByVal Y As Integer, ByVal nWidth As _
         Integer,  ByVal nHeight As Integer, ByVal hSrcDC As Integer, _
         ByVal XSrc As Integer, ByVal YSrc As Integer, ByVal dwRop As _
         Long) As Long

 32-bit: Declare Function apiBitBlt Lib "gdi32" Alias "BitBlt" (ByVal _
         hDestDC As Long, ByVal X As Long, ByVal Y As Long, ByVal nWidth _
         As Long, ByVal nHeight As Long, ByVal hSrcDC As Long, ByVal _
         XSrc  As Long, ByVal YSrc As Long, ByVal dwRop As Long) As Long

</PRE><h3>CheckMenuItem</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE> 16-bit: Declare Function CheckMenuItem Lib "User" (ByVal hMenu As _
         Integer, ByVal wIDCheckItem As Integer, ByVal wCheck As _
         Integer) As Integer

 32-bit: Declare Function apiCheckMenuItem Lib "user32" Alias _
         "CheckMenuItem" (ByVal hMenu As Long, ByVal wIDCheckItem _
         As Long, ByVal wCheck As Long) As Long

</PRE>NOTE: In Microsoft Access for Windows 95 version 7.0, you can use the
SetMenuItem macro action to set the state of menu items (enabled or
disabled, checked or unchecked) on a custom menu bar or the global menu
bar for the active window. For more information about the SetMenuItem
action, search the Help Index for "SetMenuItem Action."
<P>
In Microsoft Access 97, you can use the SetMenuItem macro action only
with custom menu bars and global menu bars created using menu bar
macros. The SetMenuItem action is included in Microsoft Access 97 for
compatibility with earlier versions. To implement the same functionality
with the CommandBars collection in Microsoft Access 97, use the Enabled
and State properties of command bars in Visual Basic for Applications to
enable or disable, check or uncheck items on menu bars, toolbars, and
shortcut menus. For more information about these properties, search the
Help Index for "Enabled" or "State," or ask the Microsoft Access 97
Office Assistant.
<P>
<P><h3>ChooseColor</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE> 16-bit: Declare Function ChooseColor_API Lib "COMMDLG.DLL" Alias _
         "ChooseColor" (pCHOOSECOLOR As ChooseColor) As Integer

            hwndOwner As Long
            hInstance  As Long
            RgbResult As Long
            lpCustColors As Long
            Flags As Long
            lCustData As Long
            lpfnHook As Long
            lpTemplateName As Long
         End Type

         Declare Function apiChooseColor Lib "comdlg32.dll" Alias _
         "ChooseColorA" (pChoosecolor As CHOOSECOLOR) As Long

</PRE>NOTE: You can use the ChooseColor functionality of this API by using
the Common Dialog ActiveX control included with the Microsoft Access
Developer's Toolkit for Windows 95 and Microsoft Office 97 Developer
Edition.

<P><h3>CloseClipboard</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE> 16-bit: Declare Function CloseClipboard Lib "User" () As Integer

         String, ByVal bFailIfExists As Long) As Long

</PRE>NOTE: File attributes (FILE_ATTRIBUTE_*) for the existing file are copied
to the new file. For example, if an existing file has the
FILE_ATTRIBUTE_READONLY file attribute, a copy created through a call to
CopyFile will also have the FILE_ATTRIBUTE_READONLY file attribute. For
further information on file attributes, see CreateFile.

within Microsoft Access 7.0 or 97.
