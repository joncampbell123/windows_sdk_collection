<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0c
<LI>Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, versions 5.0, 5.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 5.0, it may not be possible for a Visual Basic 
subroutine to select an individual data label attached to a filled radar 
series.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
If your subroutine must select an individual data label attached to a
filled radar series, you can use the Application.ExecuteExcel4Macro
method to select the label.
<P>
Normally, if you want to select the fourth label in the second
series, you would use the following Visual Basic code:
<P>
<PRE>   ActiveChart.SeriesCollection(2).Points(4).DataLabel.Select

</PRE>However, if the label is attached to a filled radar series, you must use
the following instead:
<P>
<PRE>   Application.ExecuteExcel4Macro "SELECT(""Text S2P4"")"

</PRE>Note that the double quotation marks inside the parentheses are necessary
because the method will remove a complete set when the command is executed.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, there are two types of radar charts:
<P>
<PRE>   Type of Radar Chart   Description
   --------------------------------------------------

   Wireframe             Lines connect the points but
                         are not filled.

   Filled                All lines connect the points
                         and a fill pattern is
                         applied such that a polygon
                         is formed, with the series
                         forming the perimeter of the
                         polygon.

</PRE>In the Microsoft Excel ChartWizard, only the type 6 radar chart is a filled
radar chart (all other types of radar chart are wireframes). You cannot mix
a wireframe and a filled radar series in the same chart.
<P>
If you are recording a Visual Basic macro and you select an individual data
label attached to a series (in this example, the fourth point of the second
series), the recorded code looks like this:
<P>
<PRE>   ActiveChart.SeriesCollection(2).Points(4).DataLabel.Select

</PRE>If you run this line of code when the second series is a filled radar
series, you will receive the error message
<P>
<PRE>   Run-time error '1006':
   Unable to get the DataLabel property of the Point class

</PRE>The code will run correctly if the series is any other type of series,
including a wireframe radar series.
<P>
To select an individual data label attached to a filled radar series,
you must use the Application.ExecuteExcel4Macro method, shown above.

</PRE>This Visual Basic code example selects the label attached to the fifth
point of the second series in a chart and moves the label to the
coordinates 20,20. The series is a filled radar series, so the
Application.ExecuteExcel4Macro is used to avoid the error described above.
<P>
<PRE>   Sub MoveDataLabel()

       ' Select the fifth point (P5) of the second series (S2).
       ' Normally, you would use:
       '
       '   ActiveChart.SeriesCollection(2).Points(5).DataLabel.Select
       '
       ' to do this, but this method does not work with a filled radar
       ' chart in Microsoft Excel 5.0.
       Application.ExecuteExcel4Macro "SELECT(""Text S2P5"")"

       'Change the selection's (the label's) Left property.
       Selection.Left = 20

       'Change the selection's (the label's) Top property.
       Selection.Top = 20
   End Sub
