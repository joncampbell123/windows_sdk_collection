<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article explains where to get technical support for third-party
developers who are integrating Visual Basic, Applications Edition, v1.0
into their own host applications.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft is now licensing its Visual Basic for Applications 5.0 (VBA5)
technology to third-party developers. These developers can integrate VBA5
into their own applications in the same way that Microsoft Office 97
applications do. This allows their applications to be completely customized
by a Visual Basic programmer working in the VBA development environment.
<P>
Integration involves intensive work with C/C++ and OLE. To assist
developers with this process, Microsoft provides a VBA5 SDK. It contains
required software libraries, source files, DLLs, a test kit,
re-distributable files, a Failsafe Install program, and API documentation
and integration guides. An included sample, TTHost, walks developers
through the various steps required to integrate VBA into a host application
successfully.
<P>
Microsoft has authorized two Sales Agents, Mystic River Software and Summit
Software Company, to handle the licensing and technical support for all the
other licensees. The VBA5 SDK is available only through these Sales Agents.
<P>
