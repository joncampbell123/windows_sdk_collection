The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition 
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you use the EnableSelection property of a worksheet to restrict certain 
cells from being selected, you may still be able to select the restricted 
cells. For example, if you use the following code to prevent selection of 
locked cells:
<P>
<PRE>   ActiveSheet.EnableSelection = xlUnlockedCells

</PRE>it may still be possible to select locked cells.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This occurs because the EnableSelection property does not prevent you from
selecting cells using the Name box on the Formula bar.
<P>
Also, you can use a macro to select cells, even if they are locked, by 
using a line of code similar to the following:
<P>
<PRE>   Range("B5").Select

</PRE><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Even though you can select restricted cells, if the cells are locked and
the worksheet is protected, you cannot change them.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
You can use the EnableSelection property of a worksheet to determine what, 
if any, cells on a worksheet may be selected by the user. EnableSelection 
has three possible values: 
<P>
<PRE>   Value              Definition
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------

   xlNoRestrictions   Any cell can be selected.
   xlNoSelection      No cells can be selected.
   xlUnlockedCells    If the worksheet is protected, only cells that are
                      unlocked can be selected.

</PRE>You can unlock a cell or group of cells by following these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Select the cell(s) to be unlocked.

<P><LI>On the Format menu, click Cells. Click the Protection tab.

<P><LI>Clear the Locked check box. Click OK.
<P>
</OL>If the worksheet is protected and you have set the EnableSelection property
to xlUnlockedCells, you cannot select locked cells, either by clicking them
with the mouse or by using the Go To dialog box.
<P>
However, you can select locked cells by using the Name box on the Formula
bar. If you click the Name box, type in a cell reference (D5, for example)
or a range reference (D5:E10, for example), and then press Enter, the
indicated cell or range will be selected.
<P>
Because the cells are locked and the worksheet protected, they cannot be
changed. You can still copy or fill from a locked cell into unlocked cells
without receiving any error messages.
