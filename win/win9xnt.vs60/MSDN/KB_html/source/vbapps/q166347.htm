<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 97, you can use the SheetChange event in Visual Basic
for Applications to automatically run a macro whenever you change the
contents of any worksheet in the workbook. This article explains how to use
the SheetChange event and the SheetChange subroutine.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>

Microsoft provides examples of Visual Basic for Applications procedures for

provided 'as is' and Microsoft does not guarantee that they can be used in
all situations. While Microsoft support engineers can help explain the
functionality of a particular macro, they will not modify these examples to
provide added functionality, nor will they help you construct macros to
meet your specific needs. If you have limited programming experience, you
may want to consult one of the Microsoft Solution Providers. Solution
Providers offer a wide range of fee-based services, including creating
custom macros. For more information about Microsoft Solution Providers,

<P><h3>How to Access the SheetChange Subroutine in the Visual Basic Editor</h3>
 
<P>
Each workbook has a single SheetChange event. To view or edit the
subroutine that uses the SheetChange event, use the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, point to Macro, and click Visual Basic Editor.

<P><LI>If the Project window is not visible, click Project Explorer on the
   View menu.
<P>
   In the list of workbooks in the Project window, a list that is similar
   to the following appears:
<P>
<P><PRE>      VBAProject (Book1)
<PRE></PRE>         Microsoft Excel Objects
            Sheet1 (Sheet1)
            Sheet2 (Sheet2)
            Sheet3 (Sheet3)
            ThisWorkbook

</PRE><P><LI>Double-click ThisWorkbook.

<P><LI>In the Code window, click Workbook in the Object list. Then, click
   SheetChange in the Procedure list.
<P>
</OL>A subroutine that is similar to the following appears:
<P>
<PRE>   Private Sub Workbook_SheetChange(ByVal Sh As Object, ByVal Target As _
       Excel.Range)

       '&lt;code goes here&gt;

   End Sub

</PRE></OL>This is the SheetChange subroutine for the active workbook. Whenever the
SheetChange event occurs, this subroutine is automatically run.
<P>
NOTE: The first line of the subroutine (Private Sub... Excel.Range) should
be entered on a single line without an underscore (_) character.
<P>
<P><h3>What Are "Sh" and "Target"?</h3>
 
<P>
The SheetChange subroutine accepts two arguments. By default, these
arguments are Sh and Target.

<UL><LI>Sh represents the name of the worksheet that is changed. It signals the
   SheetChange subroutine to run. You can use this argument to determine
   the worksheet name, for example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      xWorksheetName = Sh.Name
</PRE>
<LI>Target represents the range of cells (or a single cell) that is changed.
   It signals the SheetChange subroutine to run. You can use this argument
   to determine the range of cells that changed, for example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      xChangedRange = Target.Address
</PRE><P>
</UL>Note that these arguments may be named differently; for example, you can
use SheetName and ChangedRange instead of Sh and Target. However, do not
completely remove the arguments from the subroutine. If you do, you may
receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Compile error:
   Event procedure does not match description of event having the same
   name

</PRE><h3>Using the SheetChange Subroutine</h3>
 
<P>
The SheetChange subroutine works like any other Visual Basic for
Applications subroutine in Microsoft Excel. You can use the Sh and Target
arguments to determine the worksheet and range of cells that changed, or to
determine the value of the changed cells. You can use these values to
perform other actions.
<P>
For example, the following subroutine opens a workbook when you type the
name into a cell in a worksheet in the active workbook:
<P>
<PRE>   Private Sub Workbook_SheetChange(ByVal Sh As Object, ByVal Target As _
       Excel.Range)

       Workbooks.Open Filename:="C:\My Documents\" &amp; Target.Value

   End Sub

</PRE>Because Target represents the changed cell, Target.Value returns the value
in that cell. If the workbook for the name you typed exists in the My
Documents folder on drive C, it is opened.
<P>
This example subroutine only accepts values that are less than or equal to
100:
<P>
<PRE>   Private Sub Workbook_SheetChange(ByVal Sh As Object, ByVal Target As _
       Excel.Range)

       If Target.Value &gt; 100 Then
           MsgBox "This value is too high! Try again."
           Target.Clear
           Target.Select
       End If

   End Sub

</PRE>If you type a value that is greater than 100 in a cell in the workbook, a
message box appears and the value is removed.
<P>
The following example subroutine runs another macro if you type a value in
cell A1 of Sheet1:
<P>
<PRE>   Private Sub Workbook_SheetChange(ByVal Sh As Object, ByVal Target As _
       Excel.Range)

       If Sh.Name = "Sheet1" And Target.Address = "$A$1" Then
           RunOtherSub    'This is the name of the macro to run.
       End If

   End Sub

   Sub RunOtherSub()
       MsgBox "You typed a value in Sheet1!$A$1."
   End Sub

</PRE>If any other cell in the workbook is changed, the subroutine does nothing.
