<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you use OLE automation to process calls to an application, there may
be processes occurring within that application that prevent setting the
OLE object until the application is free to process the request. This
article includes sample Visual Basic for Applications code to demonstrate
how you can use an idle loop to wait until the application is free to
process the call.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft provides examples of Visual Basic for Applications procedures
for illustration only, without warranty either expressed or implied,
including, but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability
and/or fitness for a particular purpose. The Visual Basic procedures in
this article are provided 'as is' and Microsoft does not guarantee that
they can be used in all situations. While Microsoft support engineers can
help explain the functionality of a particular macro, they will not modify
these examples to provide added functionality, nor will they help you
construct macros to meet your specific needs. If you have limited
programming experience, you may want to consult one of the Microsoft
Solution Providers. Solution Providers offer a wide range of fee-based
services, including creating custom macros. For more information about
Microsoft Solution Providers, call Microsoft Customer Information Service

<P>
The following example Visual Basic for Applications macro is run from
Microsoft Excel 97. The macro calls a Microsoft Access 97 Visual Basic for
Applications macro whose function is to export a query to RTF format and
import into Word for Windows.
<P>
Because Word will be busy importing the RTF file, the macro then checks to
see if Word is busy before it creates a Word OLE object. If it is, the
macro then uses a combination of an error trap, Windows Sleep and
SendMessage API calls to cycle until Word is free from the import process.
Once Word has completed the importing the file, the macro creates a Word
object to save the imported RTF data as a Word document.
