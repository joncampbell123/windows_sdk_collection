<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual Basic Programming System, Applications Edition,
   version 1.0

<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Visual Basic Programming System, Applications Edition, the
data type of the value returned by a Property Get procedure may be a
user-defined type; however, the Help topic for the Property Get statement
does not include this as a valid return value.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft product
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The online help topic for Property Get does not list a user-defined type as
a valid return value; however, you can return a value in a Property Get
procedure as a user-defined type.
<P>
In the following procedure, the Property Get statement is used to define a
property procedure that gets the value of a property which identifies the
zip code as the user-defined Address type.
<P>
<PRE>   Type Address
      Zip As Long
   End Type

   Sub Test()
      ' Convert value returned by Property procedure to String
      ' and display in message box
      MsgBox CStr(My_Address.Zip)
   End Sub

   ' Returns the zip code as Address type
   Property Get My_Address() As Address
      My_Address.Zip = 98052
   End Property
