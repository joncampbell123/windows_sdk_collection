<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0

<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications in Microsoft Excel includes a 
property, EnableCancelKey, that can trap or ignore attempts to interrupt a 
procedure that is currently running. This property setting may be ignored 
when you press CTRL+BREAK or ESC (or COMMAND+PERIOD on the Macintosh).
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The EnableCancelKey property will be ignored when you are printing within a
Visual Basic procedure.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
You cannot work around this issue.
<P>
NOTE: You can test to see if the printing was successful, but you cannot
stop the user from interrupting the printing. For an example of how to
accomplish this task with a macro, see the macro provided in the "More
Information" section of this article.

</PRE>Printing in a Visual Basic for Applications procedure is a function of
Microsoft Windows, not Microsoft Excel. Therefore, error trapping for user
interrupts would be ineffective because error trapping only applies for
Microsoft Excel actions. You can, however test to see if printing was
successful and take the appropriate steps. The following procedure traps
for user-interrupted or unsuccessful printing by assigning the Visual Basic
statement that performs the printing to a variable and testing the value of
the variable. Determining if the user interrupted the printing this way can
be tricky because the printing could also be unsuccessful for other
reasons, such as no default printer, a blank worksheet is active, and so
on. The following example procedure demonstrates in-line error handling
with user-interrupts disabled.
<P>
<P><h3>Handling Printing Errors Programmatically</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   ' This macro uses in-line error checking and assumes that the user
   ' does not have the ability to interrupt the macro.

   Sub InLinePrintHandling()
      Dim Printout_Successful As Boolean
      Dim response As Integer

      ' Because this macro is an example of In-Line error handling,
      ' it's assumed that errors are handled immediately after the
      ' line is executed.  Therefore, on every error we're resuming
      ' to the next line where there should be an IF test for
      ' possible errors.
      On Error Resume Next

      Application.EnableCancelKey = xlDisabled ' Disable user interrupts.

      Printout_Successful = False   ' Initialize the printing variable

      Do
         ' If there is some problem printing, Printout_Successful will
         'have a value of False.
         Printout_Successful = ActiveSheet.PrintOut

         If Not Printout_Successful Then

            ' Display a message box to ask the user if they would like to
            ' retry printing or to cancel printing.
            response = MsgBox("Printing failed due to your interruption " _
               &amp; "or some other problem. Do you want to Retry " &amp; _
               "printing or Cancel printing and continue with" &amp; _
               " the macro?", vbRetryCancel + vbCritical + _
               vbApplicationModal, "Print failure!")

            ' If you do not want to retry printing, exit the loop.
            If response = vbCancel Then Exit Do

         End If

      Loop Until Printout_Successful

   End Sub

</PRE>Run the macro above from a new worksheet that does not have any data. The
message box in the macro will appear because there will be a printing error
due to the fact there is nothing to print in your worksheet.
<P>
<P><h3>Trapping Escape Key with Error Handler</h3>
 
<P>
When a Visual Basic procedure is running, you can usually interrupt the
procedure by pressing CTRL+BREAK or ESC (or COMMAND+PERIOD on the 
Macintosh). If you allow your procedure to be interrupted, you can make
sure your procedure is notified so that it can close files, disconnect from
shared resources, or restore modified variables before returning control of
the application to the user.
<P>
You can trap user interrupts in your procedures by setting the
EnableCancelKey property to xlErrorHandler. With this property set, all
interrupts generate run-time error number 18, which you can trap using an
On Error statement. You can handle this error to halt the procedure and
exit the program. If you use the Resume statement to continue after a
trapped run-time error, however, the interrupt is ignored. You can also
ignore user interrupts completely by setting the EnableCancelKey property
to xlDisabled. To see an example of this, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Enter the following in a new module sheet in a new workbook.
<P>
<PRE>      Sub Test_Esc()

         On Error GoTo handleCancel
         Application.EnableCancelKey = xlErrorHandler

         MsgBox "This may take a long time: press ESC to cancel"

         For x = 1 To 1000000    ' Do something 1,000,000 times (long!)
            ActiveSheet.Range("A1").Offset(x - 1, 0).Value = x
         Next x

         handleCancel:
            If Err = 18 Then         '18 is the error returned when the
               MsgBox "You canceled" 'EnableCancelKey property is set to
            End If                   'xlErrorHandler.

      End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>Activate Sheet1 in this workbook.

<P><LI>Run the Test_Esc macro.

<P><LI>Click OK in the message box informing you "This may take a long
   time..." and then press ESC.
<P>
</OL>Another message box will appear informing you that you canceled the
procedure.
