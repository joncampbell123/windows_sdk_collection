<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article demonstrates a sample Visual Basic for Applications function
that you can use to compute a moving average for a set of values in a table
based on a given period of time. For example, if you have data that has
been collected weekly for the past year and you want to compute a
historical average for a three-week time period on each value, you can use
this function to return an average for each value in the table based on the
current value and the values from the two previous weeks.
<P>
This article assumes that you are familiar with Visual Basic for
Applications and with creating Microsoft Access applications using the
programming tools provided with Microsoft Access. For more information
about Visual Basic for Applications, please refer to your version of the
"Building Applications with Microsoft Access" manual.
<P>
NOTE: Visual Basic for Applications is called Access Basic in Microsoft
Access version 2.0. For more information about Access Basic, please refer
to the "Building Applications" manual.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following sample function computes moving averages based on a table
with a multiple-field primary key. The weekly values of foreign currencies
are used for this example. To create the sample function, follow these
steps:

<OL><P><LI>Create the following table and save it as Table1:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Table: Table1
      -----------------------------------------
      Field Name: CurrencyType [Primary Key]
      Data Type: Text
      Field Size: 25
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      Field Name: TransactionDate [Primary Key]
      Data Type: Date/Time
      Format: Short Date
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      Field Name: Rate
      Data Type: Currency
      Decimal Places: 4
</PRE>
<P><LI>View the table in Datasheet view and enter the following values:
<P>
<PRE>      CurrencyType     TransactionDate     Rate
      --------------------------------------------
      Yen              8/6/93              $0.0079

   NOTE: This query will generate a three-week moving average of the Rate
   data. To compute a longer or shorter moving average, change the
   number 3 in the query's Expr1 column to the value you want to compute.

<P><LI>Run the query. Note that you see the following three-week moving average
   for each currency. A Null value indicates that there were not enough
   earlier values to compute that week's average.

          Yen             09/03/93        $0.0091    0.0088

   NOTE: If you want to compute a moving average for a table with a single
   primary key, use the primary key both as an argument to be passed to
   the function and as the key value for the Seek method.
