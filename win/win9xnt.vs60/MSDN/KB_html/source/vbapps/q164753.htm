The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
When you export a form that contains a Calendar Control as an Active
Server Page, any code that you create for the control will not be exported
with the form. When you open the form on your Web browser, the Calendar
Control will be set to the current date. To be able to set the value for
the Calendar Control on your Active Server Page, you will need to modify
the VBScript for that form.
<P>
This article demonstrates how you can modify the VBScript code to include
the syntax you need for setting the value of the Calendar Control.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
NOTE: This section contains information about editing ASP files and
assumes that you are familiar with editing HTML files, Active Server
Pages, and Visual Basic Scripting. Microsoft Access Technical Support
engineers do not support customization of any HTML, HTX, IDC, or ASP
files.
<P>
The following example demonstrates how to change the VBScript code in an
ASP file so that it contains the code necessary for changing the value for
a Calendar Control. To modify the VBScript for a particular form, follow
these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Find the folder that contains the ASP files for the Active Server Page
   that you want to modify. This should be the same folder that you
   specified in the Server URL box, in the Microsoft Active Server Pages
   Output Options dialog box, when you output the file as an Active Server
   Page.

<P><LI>There should be two files in this folder that are associated with your
   Active Server Page. One of the files will contain the characters "alx"
   (without the quotation marks). For example, if you exported a form with
   the name Employees, the two file names that should appear in the folder
   are Employees and Employeesalx.

<P><LI>Use Notepad or another text editor to open the file that contains the
   characters "alx."

<P><LI>Scroll through the file, until you come to the OnLoad Function
   for the form. For the EmployeesAlx form, this function would be
<P>
<PRE>      Sub EmployeesAlx_OnLoad()

</PRE><P><LI>Add the following line to the procedure
<P>
<P><PRE>      CalendarControlName.Value = NewValueForControl.Value
</PRE><P>
   where CalendarControlName is the name of the Calendar Control and
   NewValueForControl is the value you want to apply to the control. For
   example, if you want to set a Calendar Control called ActiveXCTL1 to
   the value contain in a control called Birthdate, you would type the
   following in the Sub procedure:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ActiveXCtl1.value = Birthdate.value
</PRE>
<P><LI>Save the changes, and close the file.

<P><LI>Start your Web browser and type the URL in the address box for your
   Active Server Page.
<P>
   The form should open and the Calendar Control should be set to the date
   you specified in your form Load event procedure.
<P>
   NOTE: Any changes you make to the ASP file may be lost once you export
   the form again.
