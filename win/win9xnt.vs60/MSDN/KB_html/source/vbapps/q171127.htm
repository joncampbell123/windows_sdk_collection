<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the Shell command to launch another program from a Visual
Basic for Applications macro, Word does not wait for the launched program
to finish before running the rest of the macro. This article contains a
sample macro that can determine if a launched program is still running.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Visual Basic for Applications processes macro commands asynchronously. This
means that each command runs independently of any timing process, such as a
clock.
<P>
Because macros do not wait for the launched program to finish before
running the next command, this can cause problems, particularly if
subsequent commands rely on results from the launched program.
<P>
Microsoft provides examples of Visual Basic for Applications procedures for
illustration only, without warranty either expressed or implied, including,
but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and/or fitness
for a particular purpose. The Visual Basic procedures in this article are
provided 'as is' and Microsoft does not guarantee that they can be used in
all situations. While Microsoft support engineers can help explain the
functionality of a particular macro, they will not modify these examples to
provide added functionality, nor will they help you construct macros to
meet your specific needs. If you have limited programming experience, you
may want to consult one of the Microsoft Solution Providers. Solution
Providers offer a wide range of fee-based services, including creating
custom macros. For more information about Microsoft Solution Providers,

<P>
This Visual Basic for Applications macro sample uses a combination of a Do
Loop with the Exists method to determine if the launched program is still
running.
<P>
<PRE>   Sub IsTaskRunning()
      ' If file does not exist, GoTo error trap.
      On Error GoTo itrErrTrap
      ' Run sample batch file in MS-DOS window.
      Shell "c:\test.bat"
      Do
         ' Note: When specifying the Application name
         ' with the Exists(Name) argument, omit the
         ' Application extension.
         test = Tasks.Exists("test")
      Loop Until  test = 0
      MsgBox "The application has quit."
   itrErrTrap: ' Note: This line must be left aligned.
      If Err &gt; 0 then MsgBox Err.Description
   End Sub

Editor, click the Office Assistant, type "Exists" (without the quotation
marks), click Search, and then click to view the "Exists Method" topic.
