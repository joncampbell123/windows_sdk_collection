<P>
Microsoft Outlook 97 does not provide a Microsoft Visual Basic Scripting
Edition (VBScript) event that executes only when a new Outlook item is
created. This article describes a method you can use to simulate this
functionality.

</PRE>When a new form is created, Outlook executes an Item_Open event in VB
Script. However, once the item is saved in a folder, the Item_Open event
will also execute when the item is reopened. In addition, Outlook will also
execute the Item_Read event when an item is opened from a folder.
<P>
The following sample VBScript code illustrates how you can place code in
the Item_Open event so that it will only run when the item is first
created. It checks to see if the Created field of the item is populated. If
the Created field does not have a date value, the item must be a new item.
If the Created field is populated with a date value, the item has already
been saved and is therefore being reopened.
<P>
<PRE>   Sub Item_Open()

      MsgBox "This is the Item_Open event."

      ' 1/1/4501 represents a date field with no value.
      If Item.CreationTime = #1/1/4501# Then
         MsgBox "Open: Code to run when item created goes here."
      Else
         MsgBox "Open: Code to run when item opened goes here."
      End If

   End Sub

   Sub Item_Read()

      MsgBox "This is the Item_Read event."

   End Sub
