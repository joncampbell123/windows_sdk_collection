The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access versions 7.0, 97
<LI>Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit version 7.0
<LI>Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition Tools
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multiuser skills.
<P>
This article describes how to use the ReplicationConflictFunction property
in a database replica set so that you can create a custom procedure to
resolve synchronization conflicts.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you use replicated databases in Microsoft Access, you may encounter
synchronization errors from time to time. Microsoft Access includes a
Conflict Resolver wizard to help you resolve those conflicts when they
occur.
<P>
However, you may want to create your own procedure to help users resolve
synchronization conflicts. Also, the Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit
license agreement does not permit you to distribute wizards with your run-
time applications; therefore, you must create your own conflict resolution
procedure if your run-time application includes replicated databases.
<P>
The ReplicationConflictFunction property enables you to use a custom
procedure to resolve conflicts instead of using the Conflict Resolver
wizard. The procedure you create to resolve conflicts must be in a
replicable module in the Design Master.
<P>
<P><h3>Creating a Custom Conflict Resolver</h3>
 
<P>
Your custom procedure must be able to process three types of errors:

<UL><LI>Synchronization conflicts
<LI>Synchronization errors
<LI>Design errors
<P>
</UL><h3>Synchronization Conflicts</h3>
 
<P>
Synchronization conflicts occur when one record in a table is updated at
two or more different replicas. Even if the changes are made to different
fields in the record, the Microsoft Jet database engine treats it as a
conflict. The Jet database engine does not attempt to resolve the conflict.
Instead, it uses an algorithm to select one version of the record as the
official change, and it stores the other version in a conflict table.
<P>
Conflict tables are named &lt;tablename&gt;_Conflict, where &lt;tablename&gt; is the
table in which the conflict occurred. You can detect conflicts using Visual
Basic code by looking for the ConflictTable property of a table. The
following portion of a procedure checks for the existence of conflict
tables in a replica database:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub ViewSyncConflict()
      Dim Db As DATABASE
      Dim Td As TableDef
      Dim i as Integer
      Set Db = CurrentDb
      ' Step backward through the TableDefs collection so you
      ' do not miss any tables when you delete conflict tables.
      For i = Db.TableDefs.Count - 1 to 0 Step -1
         Set Td = Db.Tabledefs(i)
         If (Td.ConflictTable &lt;&gt; "") Then
            ' Open a recordset based on the conflict table.
            ' Insert code to do conflict resolution.
            ' Delete the conflicting record when you are done.
            ' Delete the conflict table when all its records are deleted.
            ' Set the ConflictTable property to "".
         End If
      Next i
   End Sub

</PRE><h3>Synchronization Errors</h3>
 
<P>
Synchronization errors can come from at least four different sources:

<UL><LI>A table-level validation rule is applied and other replicas have data
   that does not satisfy the rule.

<LI>A duplicate key error occurs because two different replicas entered
   the same primary key into a table.

<LI>A referential integrity error occurs because a primary table record
   is deleted in one replica, and a record is added to a related table
   in another replica.

<LI>A record is locked when synchronization occurs.
<P>
</UL>Synchronization errors are recorded in the MSysErrors table and are
replicated to all members of the replica set. Once you have corrected the
errors, the Jet database engine automatically removes the error records
during a subsequent synchronization.
<P>
Open the MSysErrors table to see what errors occurred. The following
portion of a procedure displays the synchronization errors in the
MSysErrors table:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub ViewSyncError()
      Dim Db As DATABASE
      Dim Rs As Recordset
      Dim MsgString As String
      On Error GoTo ErrorHandler
      Set Db = CurrentDb
      Set Rs = Db.OpenRecordset("MSysErrors", dbOpenSnapshot)
      Rs.MoveLast
      If Rs.RecordCount &gt; 0 Then
         Rs.MoveFirst
         Do Until Rs.EOF
            ' Build the error message string.
            MsgString = "Table ID: " &amp; Rs!TableGUID &amp; vbCr
            MsgString = MsgString &amp; "Record ID: " &amp; Rs!RowGUID &amp; vbCr
            MsgString = MsgString &amp; "Operation: " &amp; Rs!Operation &amp; vbCr
            MsgString = MsgString &amp; "Failed Because: " &amp; Rs!ReasonText
            MsgBox MsgString
            Rs.MoveNext
         Loop
      End If

   ExitProc:
      Exit Sub

   ErrorHandler:
      ' If the MSysErrors table is empty...
      If Err.Number = 3021 Then
         Resume ExitProc
      ' display any other error that occurs.
      Else
         MsgBox Err.Description
         Resume ExitProc
      End If
   End Sub

</PRE><h3>Design Errors</h3>
 
<P>
A design error occurs when a local object exists with the same name as a
replicable object in the Design Master. For example, if a user at a replica
creates a local form called Form1, and you create a replicable form in the
Design Master called Form1, synchronization fails. The design error is
recorded in a system table called MSysSchemaProb. The records in
MSysSchemaProb are automatically deleted when the conflict is resolved and
the design change is successfully synchronized.
<P>
The following sample procedure checks for the existence of the
MSysSchemaProb table, and displays the design error:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub ViewDesignError()
      Dim Db As DATABASE
      Dim Rs As Recordset
      Dim MsgString As String
      On Error GoTo ErrorHandler
      Set Db = CurrentDb
      Set Rs = Db.OpenRecordset("MSysSchemaProb", dbOpenSnapshot)
      Rs.MoveFirst
      Do Until Rs.EOF
         ' Build the error message string.
         MsgString = "Operation: " &amp; Rs!Command &amp; vbCr
         MsgString = MsgString &amp; "Failed Because: " &amp; Rs!ErrorText
         MsgBox MsgString
         Rs.MoveNext
      Loop

   ExitProc:
      Exit Sub

   ErrorHandler:
         ' If the MSysSchemaProb table does not exist.
         If Err.Number = 3078 Then
            Resume ExitProc
         ' If the MSysSchemaProb table is empty.
         ElseIf Err.Number = 3021 Then
            Resume ExitProc
         ' Display any other error that occurs.
         Else
            MsgBox Err.Description
            Resume ExitProc
         End If
   End Sub

</PRE><h2>Putting It All Together</h2>
 
<P>
Once you have decided how you want to handle each type of synchronization
error, create the custom function to use when conflicts occur. The
following example combines the sample procedures in each of the earlier
sections into a single function:
<P>
<PRE>   Function MyCustomFunction()
      ViewSyncConflict
      ViewSyncError
      ViewDesignError
   End Function

</PRE><h3>Setting the ReplicationConflictFunction Property</h3>
 
<P>
You can set the ReplicationConflictFunction property programmatically or
through the user interface. When you set the property programmatically, you
may have to add ReplicationConflictFunction to the Properties collection of
the database first, and then set its value.
<P>
<P><h3>Setting the ReplicationConflictFunction Programmatically</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Open the Design Master database for the replica set.

<P><LI>Create a module and type the following procedure:
<P>
<PRE>      Sub SetCustomFunction(FunctionName As String)
         Dim Db As DATABASE, Ctr As Container, Doc As Document
         Dim Prp As Property
         On Error GoTo ErrorHandler
         Set Db = CurrentDb
         Set Ctr = Db.Containers!Databases
         ' Set Document variable pointing to user defined document.
         Set Doc = Ctr.Documents!UserDefined
         ' Set the ReplicationConflictFunction property if it exists.
         Doc.Properties!ReplicationConflictFunction = FunctionName
      Exit Sub

      ErrorHandler:
         ' If the property does not exist...
         If Err.Number = 3270 Then
            ' create ReplicationConflictFunction property and set its
            ' value.
            Set Prp = Doc.CreateProperty("ReplicationConflictFunction", _
                dbText, FunctionName)
            ' Append the new property to the collection.
            Doc.Properties.Append Prp
            ' Resume the main procedure.
            Resume Next
         Else
            ' Display any other error that occurs.
            MsgBox Err.Number &amp; ": " &amp; Err.Description, vbCritical
         End If
      End Sub
