<P>
In Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications, some Window properties, such as 
WindowHeadings, affect only the active worksheet in the window.

Microsoft provides programming examples for illustration only, without
warranty either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the
implied warranties of merchantability and/or fitness for a particular
purpose. This article assumes that you are familiar with the programming
language being demonstrated and the tools used to create and debug
procedures. Microsoft support engineers can help explain the functionality
of a particular procedure, but they will not modify these examples to
provide added functionality or construct procedures to meet your specific
needs. If you have limited programming experience, you may want to contact
the Microsoft fee-based consulting line at (800) 936-5200. For more
information about the support options available from Microsoft, please see
the following page on the World Wide Web:
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/support/supportnet/refguide/default.asp">http://www.microsoft.com/support/supportnet/refguide/default.asp</A></B>

</PRE>Window properties, such as scroll bars, gridlines, and worksheet tabs, can 
be turned on or off using Visual Basic commands. They are accessed as 
properties of the Window object. Some of these properties affect every 
worksheet in the window, while others affect only the active worksheet. 
This behavior is by design, and is consistent with the behavior of the 
Window Options setting. To set these options, click Options on the Tools 
menu, and click the View tab.
<P>
The following is a list of window properties that affect only the active
worksheet in the window.
<P>
<PRE>   DisplayFormulas
   DisplayGridlines
   GridlineColor
   DisplayHeadings
   DisplayOutline
   DisplayZeros

</PRE>These properties are "per sheet-window" properties. To change these
properties on each worksheet in the window, you must select each worksheet 
before changing the properties.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create a new workbook that contains at least two worksheets.

<P><LI>Insert a new module, and then type the following code:
<P>
<PRE>      Sub Window_Test()
          ' Activate first worksheet.
          ' Substitute name of first worksheet for "Sheet1."
          Sheets("Sheet1").Activate
          ' Turn off vertical scroll bar and row and column headings
          ' in active window.
          With ActiveWindow
              .DisplayVerticalScrollbar = False
              .DisplayHeadings = False
          End With
      End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>In Microsoft Excel 97 or Microsoft Excel 98, point to Macro on the
   Tools menu, and then click Macros. In the Macro Name list, select
   Window_Test, and click Run.
<P>
   In Microsoft Excel 5.0 or 7.0, click Macro on the Tools menu, select
   Window_Test in the Macro Name/Reference list, and click Run.
<P>
<PRE>   In the first sheet in your workbook, the vertical scroll bar and row and    
</PRE></OL>column headings are turned off.

<OL><P><LI>Select the second worksheet in your workbook.
<P>
   The vertical scrollbar is turned off in the second sheet of your 
   workbook, but the row and column headers are still displayed. While both 
<PRE>   are properties of the active window, DisplayHeadings only affects the    
   active worksheet in the window, while DisplayVerticalScrollBar affects 
   all worksheets in the window.
