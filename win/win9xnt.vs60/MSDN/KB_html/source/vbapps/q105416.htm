The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, version 5.0

</UL>

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, if you use a Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications
procedure to pass a string that is greater than 255 characters in length to
an object, such as a text box, Microsoft Excel may truncate the string to
255 characters or fail to enter the string in the text box.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 7.0 or earlier, this behavior occurs because the
character limit per cell is 255 characters. As a result, strings greater
than 255 characters in length that are passed from a Visual Basic procedure
to any Microsoft Excel specific function or object are truncated to 255
characters.
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows and Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition, 
you can use more than 255 characters in a cell; however, when you pass 
strings greater than 255 characters in length from a Visual Basic 
procedure, Microsoft Excel 97 retains the same design features that earlier 
versions of Microsoft Excel use.
<P>
This limit applies to all strings that you pass from a Visual Basic
procedure to a Microsoft Excel sheet (it is not exclusive to information
you pass to cells). For example, if you pass a text string longer than 255
characters to a text box on a worksheet or a dialog sheet, Microsoft Excel
truncates the text even though a text box can hold up to 10,240 characters.
<P>

implied warranties of merchantability and/or fitness for a particular
purpose. This article assumes that you are familiar with the programming
language being demonstrated and the tools used to create and debug
procedures. Microsoft support engineers can help explain the functionality
of a particular procedure, but they will not modify these examples to
provide added functionality or construct procedures to meet your specific
needs. If you have limited programming experience, you may want to contact
the Microsoft fee-based consulting line at (800) 936-5200. For more

<P>
<PRE>   <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/support/supportnet/refguide/default.asp">http://www.microsoft.com/support/supportnet/refguide/default.asp</A></B>

</PRE>To insert more than 255 characters in a text box, use the Characters
property to insert multiple string variables. The following sample macros
use the Characters property to do this. Note that the third example is for
use with Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows.
<P>
<P><h3>Example 1</h3>
 
<P>
In the example below, the character length of each variable is 100. Each
Insert method inserts another string at the position at the end of the
previous string.
<P>
<PRE>Sub NoLoop()
   Dim var1 as String, var2 as String, var3 as String
   Dim first As Integer, secnd As Integer, third As Integer

   ' Note that each of the strings in quotation marks should be entered
   ' on one line.
   var1 = _
      "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
      aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"
   var2 = _
      "bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb
      bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb"
   var3 = _
      "cccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc
      cccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc"
   var4 = _
      "dddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd
      dddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd"

   'Character length of each variable string is 100 characters.
   ' Define variable equal to length of first string.
   first = Len(var1) + 1
   ' Define variables equal to length of original string plus
   ' length of each additional string.
   secnd = first + Len(var2)
   third = secnd + Len(var3)

   ' Insert first string into text box
   DialogSheets(1).TextBoxes(1).Characters.Insert String:=var1
   ' Insert second string at the location of the end of the first string.
   DialogSheets(1).TextBoxes(1).Characters(first).Insert String:=var2
   ' Insert third string at the location of the end of the second string
   ' and so on.
   DialogSheets(1).TextBoxes(1).Characters(secnd).Insert String:=var3
   DialogSheets(1).TextBoxes(1).Characters(third).Insert String:=var4

End Sub

</PRE><h3>Example 2</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>Sub Loop ()

   Dim i as Integer
   Dim mytxt As String
   ' Assign mytxt variable to the desired string
   ' String should be entered as one line
   mytxt = "This is the desired string longer than 255 characters."

   With DialogSheets(1).TextBoxes(1)

      ' Initialize text in text box.
      .Text = ""
      For i = 0 To Int(Len(mytxt) / 255)
         .Characters(.Characters.Count + 1).Insert Mid(mytxt, (i * 255) + _
            1, 255)
      Next

   End With

End Sub

</PRE><h3>Example 3</h3>
 
<P>
In the example below, each statement adds 200 "X" characters to the text
box. This is very similar to the first example but uses syntax that is
specific to Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows.
<P>
<PRE>Sub Excel97()

   ActiveSheet.Shapes("Text Box 2").Select
   Selection.Characters.Text = _
   "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
   XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
   XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"

   Selection.Characters(201).Insert String:= _
   "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
   XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
   XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"

End Sub

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Using Visual Basic for Applications is an improvement over using the
Microsoft Excel 4.0 macro language in that you can use Visual Basic
procedures for parsing, reading, and writing from a file up to 64 KB in
size. When you use strings in a Visual Basic procedure, you are not limited
to 255 characters; if you are using Microsoft Windows version 3.1, you can
use strings up to 64 KB.
