<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you write Visual Basic Script (VBScript) code to customize a Microsoft
Outlook 97 form, you must understand the relationship between the item's
fields and form controls.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>

</PRE><h3>The Difference Between Controls and Fields</h3>
 
<P>
Controls are objects, such as a text box, a scroll bar, a rectangle, a list
box, or a command button, that let users control the program. You place
controls on a form to display data or choices, perform an action, or make
the form easier to read. As an example, you can control a mail message item
by using built-in controls, such as the "Subject" textbox, or you can
modify the form by adding your own controls. Controls, by themselves,
provide no storage for the data that is associated with them. Controls are
only the visual representation of the data on the form.
<P>
Item fields are the actual Messaging Application Programming Interface
(MAPI) properties where you store data when you save or send an item. In
the example above, the "Subject" listbox control is linked (or "bound") to
an item field also called "Subject." The control and the field may or may
not have the same name.
<P>
<P><h3>Using Fields and Controls</h3>
 
<P>
All of the built-in form controls (To, From, Cc, and such) are
automatically linked to corresponding built-in MAPI fields. However, if you
create a custom form and add a custom control, you must also create a MAPI
field to store the data that is associated with the control.
<P>
For example, suppose you want to add a textbox to your mail message form
that will allow people to type in their office location. When you design
the new form, you can add a textbox control by dragging the control from a
special toolbar called the Control Toolbox. This creates a place to type in
the office location. Since the control itself provides no storage for the
item, when you send the item to someone, the text you typed into the office
location is lost. You must also create a field to provide storage for the
data.
<P>
You can create a field by using the Field Chooser. Once the field is
created, you then use the Properties dialog of the office location textbox
control to bind the control to the field. Once this is done, the office
location control has an item field to provide storage for the data. This
way, when someone fills in the field and sends the item, the data is
preserved when the item is received by someone else.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Create a Control On a Form</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create a new item, such as a new message.

<P><LI>On the form's Tools menu, click "Design Outlook Form" to switch
   to the form's design mode.

<P><LI>On the Form menu, click Control Toolbox.

<P><LI>Drag the control type that you want from the Control Toolbox
   to the place on the form where you want the control to appear.
<P>
</OL><h3>Steps to Create a Field to Provide Storage for the Control</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>If the Field Chooser window is not open, on the form's Form
   menu, click Field Chooser. You can also open the Field Chooser
   from the main Outlook View menu if you are not in design view
   and have no items open.

<P><LI>Click New to open the New Field dialog box.

<P><LI>In the Name box, type a name for your new field. In the Type list,
   click to select the data type of field. In the Format list, click to
   select the format for the field.

<P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
</OL><h3>Steps to Bind a Control to a Field</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Starting in the form design view, use the right mouse button to
   click the control, and then click Properties on the shortcut menu.

<P><LI>In Properties, click the Value tab.

<P><LI>Click Choose Field to select the field you want to bind to this control.
   NOTE: You can also click New to create a new field at this time
   instead of using the Field Chooser.
<P>
</OL><h3>Using VBScript to Change Field and Control Values</h3>
 
<P>
The VBScript syntax for accessing values associated with controls is quite
different from the syntax for accessing fields. There are situations where
it is possible to change a value by using either method.
<P>
<P><h3>Syntax for Accessing a Control on a Form</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   Generic: Item.GetInspector.ModifiedFormPages("PageName").Controls _
            ("ControlName").Property = &lt;value&gt;

   Example: Item.GetInspector.ModifiedFormPages("Message") _
            .Controls("OfficeLoc").Visible = True

</PRE></OL><h3>Syntax for Accessing a Built-in Field</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   Generic: Item.FieldName = &lt;Value&gt;

   Example: Item.Subject = "This is a new subject"

</PRE><h3>Syntax for Accessing a Field You Create (User-defined Field)</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   Generic: Item.UserProperties.Find("FieldName").Property = Value

   Example: Item.UserProperties.Find("OfficeLoc").Value = "Blg 4, 1234"

</PRE><h3>Usage Examples</h3>
 
<P>
In the "Office Location" example above, these two example lines of code
have the same effect on the form.
<P>
<PRE>   Item.UserProperties.Find("OfficeLoc").Value = "Blg 4, 1234"

      -or-

   Item.GetInspector.ModifiedFormPages("Message").Controls _
   ("OfficeLoc").Text = "Blg 4, 1234"

</PRE>The first example changes the Office Location field to a new value, and the
second line changes the textbox control text property to the new value.
Since the control is bound to the field, a change made in either place
affects the other.
<P>
<P><h3>Tips for When to Use Each Method</h3>
 

<UL><LI>When you want to change a "Property" (color, visibility, bold, italic)
   of a form control, you must use the control syntax. You cannot set
   properties by changing the field.
<P>
<PRE>   Example:    Make the Office Location textbox not visible

   Correct:    Item.GetInspector.ModifiedFormPages("Message") _
               .Controls("OfficeLoc").Visble = False

   Incorrect:  Item.UserProperties.Find("OfficeLoc").Visible = False

</PRE><LI>When you want to change the value of the data (text, number, date)
   use the field syntax. If the field is a built-in field then the syntax
   for the field method is much simpler.
<P>
<PRE>   Example:    Change the office location text to "Building 5"

   Preferred:  Item.UserProperties.Find("OfficeLoc").Value = "Building 5"

   Also works: Item.GetInspector.ModifiedFormPages("Message") _
               .Controls("OfficeLoc").Text = "Buiding 5"

   Example:    Change the subject to "This is a subject"

   Preferred:  Item.Subject = "This is a subject"

   Also works: Item.GetInspector.ModifiedFormPages("Message") _
               .Controls("Subject").Text = "This is a subject"

</PRE><LI>The control method requires that the form is open. When the form is
   closed, the control is not available. The item field is always
   available and you can use references to the field in your code at all
   times. For example, suppose you want to be able to start from one item
   form and click a button that changes the subject for a different item's
   form. If you use the field method, you do not have to write code to open
   the form. If you use the control method, your code must include lines
   to display the form. Displaying the item takes more code and more time.
   Fields work whether the form is loaded or not, regardless of what page
   the control is on, and affect all the controls that display that field,
   not just one.  Using fields also insures that other fields calculated
   from the original update.
