The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0c
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0
<LI>Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, versions 5.0, 5.0a
</UL> 
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, when you open a workbook that contains a reference to
another workbook or add-in, you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Can't find project or library

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
You can access functions and macros in another workbook by establishing a
reference to that workbook. This reference is established by choosing the
References command from the Tools menu and then selecting the workbook
containing the functions and/or macros.
<P>
When you establish a reference to another workbook in this manner,
Microsoft Excel hard-codes the path of the file when the reference is
established. When you open a Microsoft Excel file that has a saved
reference, Microsoft Excel searches for the file in the following places:

<UL><LI>The hard-coded path for the reference

<LI>The current working directory

<LI>All directories specified by PATH in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file

<LI>The path of the file that contains the reference

<LI>The path where the EXCEL.EXE file is located
<P>
</UL>This can present problems when workbooks are moved to different computers.
<P>
If Microsoft Excel can find the file in any of these locations, the
reference will be successfully established. If the file cannot be found,
you may receive the error message "Can't find project or library."
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>

</PRE>To avoid this error message, use either of the following methods.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1</h3>
 
<P>
Move the workbook that is referenced to any of the locations specified 
above.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 2</h3>
 
<P>
Use the Run method of the Application instead of using the References 
command on the Tools menu.
<P>
For example, if you have the following macro in a workbook that has a 
reference established to the add-in XLODBC.XLA:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub GetData()

      Dim r As Integer
      Dim c As Integer
      Dim chan As Variant

      ' Establish a channel to the data source Nwind.
      chan = Sqlopen("DSN=NWIND")

      ' Execute a query on the channel to return all the records from
      ' the EMPLOYEE table.
      c = Sqlexecquery(chan, "SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE")

      ' Return the data from the query to A1 on the active sheet.
      r = Sqlretrieve(chan, ActiveSheet.Cells(1))

      ' Close the channel.
      Sqlclose chan

   End Sub

</PRE>You could replace this macro with the macro below. You do not need to 
establish a reference to XLODBC.XLA to run this macro:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub GetData()

      Dim r as Variant
      Dim c as Variant
      Dim chan as Variant

      ' Open the add-in XLODBC.XLA which is located in the \MSQUERY
      ' subdirectory of the Microsoft Excel Library directory.
      Workbooks.Open (Application.LibraryPath _
         &amp; "\MSQUERY\XLODBC.XLA")

      ' Depending on the add-in, you may need to use the
      ' RunAutoMacros method to run the add-ins auto-open procedures.
      ' For example, the Analysis ToolPak - VBA add-in (ATPVBAEN.XLA)
      ' needs to run its auto-open procedure before you can use the
      ' NETWORKDAYS() function. The line would read as follows:
      '
      '    Workbooks("ATPVBAEN.XLA").RunAutoMacros (xlAutoOpen)

      ' Establish a channel to the data source Nwind.
      chan = Run("XLODBC.XLA!Sqlopen", "DSN=NWIND")

      ' Execute a query on the channel to return all the records from
      ' the EMPLOYEE table.
      c = Run("XLODBC.XLA!Sqlexecquery", chan, _
         "SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE")

      ' Return the data from the query to A1 on the active sheet.
      r = Run("XLODBC.XLA!Sqlretrieve", chan, ActiveSheet.Cells(1))

      ' Close the channel.
      Run "XLODBC.XLA!Sqlclose", chan

   End Sub
