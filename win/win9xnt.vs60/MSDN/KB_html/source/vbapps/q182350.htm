<UL><LI>Microsoft Word 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you view Full Screen (on the View menu click Full Screen), the Full
Screen toolbar is missing.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
By design, Word does not provide a menu command to turn off the Full Screen
toolbar. The only way to hide the Full Screen toolbar is to run a Visual
Basic for Applications command.
<P>
If the Full Screen toolbar is hidden, you may have a macro or add-in that
has set the visible property for the Full Screen toolbar to False.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
