The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition 
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you close a workbook in Microsoft Excel for Windows, the program
may stop responding, or you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down.
   If the problem persists, contact the program vendor.

</PRE>If you click Details, you receive an error message similar to the
following:
<P>
<PRE>   EXCEL caused an invalid page fault in module EXCEL.EXE at
   0137:3013a71b.

</PRE>In Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition, the program may stop responding, 
or it may shut down unexpectedly without any error message. 
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may occur when the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>The workbook contains a BeforeClose macro, a macro that runs
   automatically when you close the workbook.
<P>
<P><PRE>      Example:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>         Private Sub Workbook_BeforeClose(Cancel As Boolean)
            ' &lt;Your code goes here.&gt;
         End Sub

    -and-

</PRE><LI>The BeforeClose macro contains code that deletes a worksheet in the
   workbook.
<P>
<P><PRE>      Example:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>         Worksheets("Sheet2").Delete

    -and-

</PRE><LI>When you close the workbook, the active worksheet (Sheet2, in this
   example) is deleted by the BeforeClose macro.
<P>

</PRE>To prevent this problem from occurring, modify your BeforeClose macro so it
does not attempt to delete the active worksheet, as demonstrated by the
following sample macro:
<P>
<PRE>   Private Sub Workbook_BeforeClose(Cancel As Boolean)

       ' If Sheet2, the sheet you want to delete, is the active
       ' worksheet, then...
       If ActiveSheet.Name = "Sheet2" Then

           ' ...activate a different worksheet.
           Worksheets("Sheet1").Activate

       End If

       ' It is now safe to delete Sheet2.
       Worksheets("Sheet2").Delete

   End Sub
