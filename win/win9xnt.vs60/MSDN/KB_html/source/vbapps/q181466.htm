<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition, when you run a Microsoft Visual
Basic for Applications macro in which you dimension a variable as a
UserForm control, such as a check box, a list box, a scroll bar, or an
option button, you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Run-time error '13':
   Type mismatch

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs when the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>The control you are using is included in the Microsoft Forms 2.0 Object
   Library.
<P>
   For example, the line of code that dimensions the variable resembles any
   of the following examples:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Dim X As CheckBox
      Dim Y As Label
      Dim Z As ListBox
      Dim A As OptionButton
      Dim B As ScrollBar
      Dim C As TextBox
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    -and-
</PRE>
<LI>You attempt to add a control to a UserForm using a line of code similar
   to the following example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Set X = UserForm1.Controls.Add("Forms.Checkbox.1", "Name", True)
</PRE><P>
</UL>This behavior occurs because these controls exist in both the Microsoft
Excel 8.0 Object Library, which applies to dialog sheets, and in the
Microsoft Excel Forms 2.0 Object Library, which applies to UserForms.
<P>
Unless you add "MsForms." to the beginning of the data type in the Dim
statement, Microsoft Excel assumes that you want to use the Microsoft Excel
object type, not the type in the Microsoft Forms 2.0 Object Library. This
causes a problem when you attempt to insert a control by using the Set
statement.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>

Microsoft provides programming examples for illustration only, without

purpose. This article assumes that you are familiar with the programming
language being demonstrated and the tools used to create and debug
procedures. Microsoft support engineers can help explain the functionality
of a particular procedure, but they will not modify these examples to
provide added functionality or construct procedures to meet your specific
needs. If you have limited programming experience, you may want to contact
the Microsoft fee-based consulting line at (800) 936-5200. For more

<P>
<PRE>   <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/support/supportnet/refguide/default.asp">http://www.microsoft.com/support/supportnet/refguide/default.asp</A></B>

</PRE>To work around this problem, type "MsForms." (without the quotation marks)
at the beginning of the data type in the Dim statement. For example, change
the examples in the "Cause" section to the following:
<P>
<PRE>   Dim X As MsForms.CheckBox
   Dim Y As MsForms.Label
   Dim Z As MsForms.ListBox
   Dim A As MsForms.OptionButton
   Dim B As MsForms.ScrollBar
   Dim C As MsForms.TextBox

</PRE>Then, set the variable to the control that you want to add using Visual
Basic code.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design of Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition.
