<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you attempt to use the Sendkeys method with the Application object in
Visual Basic for applications to send special characters (such as letters
in international alphabets, accents, currency symbols, and fractions) to
Microsoft Excel, the code may appear to be ineffective. Specifically, the
following line of code appears to not send any keystrokes:
<P>
<PRE>   Application.SendKeys "e"

</PRE>NOTE: The e character is created by the ALT+0233 key combination. The
numbers must be entered from the numeric keypad.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To send the special character, use the Visual Basic for applications
Sendkeys method instead of the Microsoft Excel Sendkeys method. The
following line of code will send the special character:
<P>
<PRE>   Sendkeys "e"

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The SendKeys command sends one or more keystrokes to the active window as
if the keystroke was entered from the keyboard. Each key is represented by
one or more characters. To specify a single keyboard character, use the
character itself. For example, to represent the letter A, use "A" for the
string. If you want to represent more than one character, append each
additional character to the one preceding it. To represent the letters A,
B, and C, use "ABC" for the string. The plus sign (+), caret (^), percent
sign (%), tilde (~), and parentheses ( ) have special meanings to SendKeys.
To specify one of these characters, enclose it in braces. For example, to
specify the plus sign, use {+}. Brackets ([ ]) have no special meaning to
SendKeys, but you must enclose them in braces as well, because in other
programs, brackets do have a special meaning that may be significant when
you use dynamic data exchange (DDE). To send brace characters, use {{} and
{}}.
