The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run a Visual Basic for Applications macro that uses the Name
statement in Microsoft Excel 97 under the Microsoft Windows NT operating
system, you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Run-time error '75':
   Path/File access error

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>You use the Name statement in the macro to rename a directory.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>The directory you want to rename contains a file that you set equal to a
   variable by using the Dir function.
<P>
</UL>For example, the problem occurs if you create a file called Text.xls in
the MyDocs folder on your computer, and you use the following two lines
in a macro:
<P>
<PRE>   X = Dir("C:\MyDocs\Test.xls")
   Name "C:\MyDocs" As "C:\YourDocs"

</PRE>NOTE: This problem does not occur in Microsoft Windows 95.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft provides examples of Visual Basic for Applications procedures for
illustration only, without warranty either expressed or implied, including,
but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and/or fitness
for a particular purpose. The Visual Basic procedures in this article are
provided 'as is' and Microsoft does not guarantee that they can be used in
all situations. While Microsoft support engineers can help explain the
functionality of a particular macro, they will not modify these examples to
provide added functionality, nor will they help you construct macros to
meet your specific needs. If you have limited programming experience, you
may want to consult one of the Microsoft Solution Providers. Solution
Providers offer a wide range of fee-based services, including creating
custom macros. For more information about Microsoft Solution Providers,
call Microsoft Customer Information Service at (800) 426-9400.
<P>
To work around this problem, reset the pointer to another folder by using a
"dummy" variable. The following lines of code illustrate how to do this:
<P>
<PRE>   X = Dir("C:\MyDocs\Test.xls")
   Y = Dir("C:\*.*")
   Name "C:\MyDocs" As "C:\YourDocs"

</PRE>In this macro, the variable Y resets the current directory. You can use any
variable, and the variable may point to any directory (that exists on the
hard disk) except the directory you want to rename.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
