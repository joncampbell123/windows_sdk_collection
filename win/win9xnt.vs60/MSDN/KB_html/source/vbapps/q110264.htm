The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Standard, Professional, and Enterprise Editions of Microsoft Visual
   Basic, 16-bit and 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0
<LI>Standard and Professional Editions of Microsoft Visual Basic for
   Windows, versions 2.0, 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
It is a good idea to establish naming conventions for your Visual Basic
code. This article gives you the naming conventions used by Microsoft
Consulting Services (MCS).
<P>
This document is a superset of the Visual Basic coding conventions found in
the Visual Basic "Programmer's Guide."
<P>
NOTE: The third-party controls mentioned in this article are manufactured
by vendors independent of Microsoft. Microsoft makes no warranty, implied
or otherwise, regarding these controls' performance or reliability.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Naming conventions help Visual Basic programmers:

<UL><LI>standardize the structure, coding style and logic of an application.
<LI>create precise, readable, and unambiguous source code.
<LI>be consistent with other language conventions (most importantly, the
   Visual Basic Programmers Guide and standard Windows C Hungarian
   notation).
<LI>be efficient from a string size and labor standpoint, thus allowing a
   greater opportunity for longer and fuller object names.
<LI>define the minimal requirements necessary to do the above.
<P>
</UL><h3>Setting Environment Options</h3>
 
<P>
Use Option Explicit. Declare all variables to save programming time by
reducing the number of bugs caused by typos (for example, aUserNameTmp vs.
sUserNameTmp vs. sUserNameTemp). In the Environment Options dialog, set
Require Variable Declaration to Yes. The Option Explicit statement requires
you to declare all the variables in your Visual Basic program.
Save Files as ASCII Text. Save form (.FRM) and module (.BAS) files as ASCII
text to facilitate the use of version control systems and minimize the
damage that can be caused by disk corruption. In addition, you can:

<UL><LI>use your own editor
<LI>use automated tools, such as grep
<LI>create code generation or CASE tools for Visual Basic
<LI>perform external analysis of your Visual Basic code
<P>
</UL>To have Visual Basic always save files as ASCII text, from the Environment
Options dialog, set the Default Save As Format option to Text.
<P>
<P><h3>Object Naming Conventions for Standard Objects</h3>
 
<P>
The following tables define the MCS standard object name prefixes. These
prefixes are consistent with those documented in the Visual Basic
Programmers Guide.

</PRE><h3>Object Naming Convention for Database Objects</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>Prefix        Object Type          Example
</PRE> 
<PRE>db            ODBC Database        dbAccounts
ds            ODBC Dynaset object  dsSalesByRegion
fdc           Field collection     fdcCustomer
fd            Field object         fdAddress
ix            Index object         ixAge
ixc           Index collection     ixcNewAge
qd            QueryDef object      qdSalesByRegion
qry (suffix)  Query (see NOTE)     SalesByRegionQry
ss            Snapshot object      ssForecast
tb            Table object         tbCustomer
td            TableDef object      tdCustomers

</PRE>NOTE: Using a suffix for queries allows each query to be sorted with its
associated table in Microsoft Access dialogs (Add Table, List Tables
Snapshot).
<P>
<P><h3>Menu Naming Conventions</h3>
 
Applications frequently use an abundance of menu controls. As a result, you
need a different set of naming conventions for these controls. Menu control
prefixes should be extended beyond the initial mnu label by adding an
additional prefix for each level of nesting, with the final menu caption at
the end of the name string. For example:
<P>
<PRE>Menu Caption Sequence   Menu Handler Name
</PRE> 
<PRE>Help.Contents           mnuHelpContents
File.Open               mnuFileOpen
Format.Character        mnuFormatCharacter
File.Send.Fax           mnuFileSendFax
File.Send.Email         mnuFileSendEmail

</PRE>When this convention is used, all members of a particular menu group are
listed next to each other in the object drop-down list boxes (in the code
window and property window). In addition, the menu control names clearly
document the menu items to which they are attached.
<P>
<P><h3>Naming Conventions for Other Controls</h3>
 
For new controls not listed above, try to come up with a unique three
character prefix. However, it is more important to be clear than to stick
to three characters.
<P>
For derivative controls, such as an enhanced list box, extend the prefixes
above so that there is no confusion over which control is really being
used. A lower-case abbreviation for the manufacturer would also typically
be added to the prefix. For example, a control instance created from the
Visual Basic Professional 3D frame could uses a prefix of fra3d to avoid
confusion over which control is really being used. A command button from
MicroHelp could use cmdm to differentiate it from the standard command
button (cmd).
<P>
<P><h3>Third-party Controls</h3>
 
Each third-party control used in an application should be listed in the
application's overview comment section, providing the prefix used for the
control, the full name of the control, and the name of the software vendor:
<P>
<PRE>Prefix    Control Type        Vendor
</PRE> 
<PRE>cmdm      Command Button      MicroHelp

</PRE><h3>Variable and Routine Naming</h3>
 
<P>
Variable and function names have the following structure:
&lt;prefix&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;qualifier&gt;&lt;suffix&gt;
<P>
<PRE>Part          Description                                  Example
</PRE> 
<PRE>&lt;prefix&gt;      Describes the use and scope of the variable. iGetRecordNext
&lt;body&gt;        Describes the variable.                      iGetNameFirst
&lt;qualifier&gt;   Denotes a derivative of the variable.        iGetNameLast
&lt;suffix&gt;      The optional Visual Basic type character.    iGetRecordNext%

</PRE>Prefixes:
<P>
The following tables define variable and function name prefixes that are
based on Hungarian C notation for Windows. These prefixes should be used
with all variables and function names. Use of old Basic suffixes (such as
%, &amp;, #, etc.) are discouraged.
<P>
Variable and Function Name Prefixes:
<P>
<PRE>Prefix    Converged    Variable Use         Data Type  Suffix
</PRE> 
<PRE>b         bln          Boolean              Integer    %
c         cur          Currency - 64 bits   Currency   @
d         dbl          Double - 64 bit      Double     #
                       signed quantity
dt        dat          Date and Time        Variant
e         err          Error
f         sng          Float/Single - 32    Single     !
                       bit signed
                       floating point
h                      Handle               Integer    %
i                      Index                Integer    %
l         lng          Long - 32 bit        Long       &amp;
                       signed quantity
n         int          Number/Counter       Integer    %
s         str          String               String     $
u                      Unsigned - 16 bit    Long       &amp;
                       unsigned quantity
          udt          User-defined type
vnt       vnt          Variant              Variant
a                      Array

</PRE>NOTE: the values in the Converged column represent efforts to pull together
the naming standards for Visual Basic, Visual Basic for Applications, and
Access Basic. It is likely that these prefixes will become Microsoft
standards at some point in the near future.
<P>
Scope and Usage Prefixes:
<P>
<PRE>Prefix         Description
</PRE> 
<PRE>g              Global
m              Local to module or form
st             Static variable
(no prefix)    Non-static variable, prefix local to procedure
v              Variable passed by value (local to a routine)
r              Variable passed by reference (local to a routine)

</PRE>Hungarian notation is as valuable in Visual Basic as it is in C. Although
the Visual Basic type suffixes do indicate a variable's data type, they do
not explain what a variable or function is used for, or how it can be
accessed. Here are some examples:
<P>
iSend - Represents a count of the number of messages sent
bSend - A Boolean flag defining the success of the last Send operation
hSend - A Handle to the Comm interface
<P>
Each of these variable names tell a programmer something very different.
This information is lost when the variable name is reduced to Send%. Scope
prefixes such as g and m also help reduce the problem of name contention
especially in multi-developer projects.
<P>
Hungarian notation is also widely used by Windows C programmers and
constantly referenced in Microsoft product documentation and in industry
programming books. Additionally, the bond between C programmers and
programmers who use Visual Basic will become much stronger as the Visual
C++ development system gains momentum. This transition will result in many
Visual Basic programmers moving to C for the first time and many
programmers moving frequently back and forth between both environments.
<P>
<P><h3>The Body of Variable and Routine Names</h3>
 
<P>
The body of a variable or routine name should use mixed case and should be
as long as necessary to describe its purpose. In addition, function names
should begin with a verb, such as InitNameArray or CloseDialog.
<P>
For frequently used or long terms, standard abbreviations are recommended
to help keep name lengths reasonable. In general, variable names greater
than 32 characters can be difficult to read on VGA displays.
<P>
When using abbreviations, make sure they are consistent throughout the
entire application. Randomly switching between Cnt and Count within a
project will lead to unnecessary confusion.
<P>
<P><h3>Qualifiers on Variable and Routine Names</h3>
 
<P>
Related variables and routines are often used to manage and manipulate a
common object. In these cases, use standard qualifiers to label the
derivative variables and routines. Although putting the qualifier after the
body of the name might seem a little awkward (as in sGetNameFirst,
sGetNameLast instead of sGetFirstName, sGetLastName), this practice will
help order these names together in the Visual Basic editor routine lists,
making the logic and structure of the application easier to understand.
The following table defines common qualifiers and their standard meaning:
<P>
Qualifier  Description (follows Body)
 
<PRE>First      First element of a set.
Last       Last element of a set.
Next       Next element in a set.
Prev       Previous element in a set.
Cur        Current element in a set.
Min        Minimum value in a set.
Max        Maximum value in a set.
Save       Used to preserve another variable that must be reset later.
Tmp        A "scratch" variable whose scope is highly localized within the
           code. The value of a Tmp variable is usually only valid across
           a set of contiguous statements within a single procedure.
Src        Source. Frequently used in comparison and transfer routines.
Dst        Destination. Often used in conjunction with Source.

</PRE><h3>User Defined Types</h3>
 
<P>
Declare user defined types in all caps with _TYPE appended to the end of
the symbol name. For example:
<P>
<PRE>   Type CUSTOMER_TYPE
      sName As String
      sState As String * 2
      lID as Long
   End Type

</PRE>When declaring an instance variable of a user defined type, add a prefix to
the variable name to reference the type. For example:
<P>
<PRE>   Dim custNew as CUSTOMER_TYPE

</PRE><h3>Naming Constants</h3>
 
<P>
The body of constant names should be UPPER_CASE with underscores (_)
between words. Although standard Visual Basic constants do not include
Hungarian information, prefixes like i, s, g, and m can be very useful in
understanding the value and scope of a constant. For constant names, follow
the same rules as variables. For Example:
<P>
<PRE>   mnUSER_LIST_MAX   ' Max entry limit for User list (integer value,
                     ' local to module)
   gsNEW_LINE        ' New Line character string (global to entire
                     ' application)

</PRE><h3>Variant Data Type</h3>
 
<P>
If you know that a variable will always store data of a particular type,
Visual Basic can handle that data more efficiently if you declare a
variable of that type.
<P>
However, the variant data type can be extremely useful when working with
databases, messages, DDE, or OLE. Many databases allow NULL as a valid
value for a field. Your code needs to distinguish between NULL, 0 (zero),
and "" (empty string). Many times, these types of operations can use a
generic service routine that does not need to know the type of data it
receives to process or pass on the data. For example:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub ConvertNulls(rvntOrg As Variant, rvntSub As Variant)
      ' If rvntOrg = Null, replace the Null with rvntSub
      If IsNull(rvntOrg) Then rvntOrg = rvntSub
   End Sub

</PRE>The are some drawbacks, however, to using variants. Code statements that
use variants can sometimes be ambiguous to the programmer. For example:
<P>
<PRE>   vnt1 = "10.01" : vnt2 = 11 : vnt3 = "11" : vnt4 = "x4"
   vntResult = vnt1 + vnt2  ' Does vntResult = 21.01 or 10.0111?
   vntResult = vnt2 + vnt1  ' Does vntResult = 21.01 or 1110.01?
   vntResult = vnt1 + vnt3  ' Does vntResult = 21.01 or 10.0111?
   vntResult = vnt3 + vnt1  ' Does vntResult = 21.01 or 1110.01?
   vntResult = vnt2 + vnt4  ' Does vntResult = 11x4 or ERROR?
   vntResult = vnt3 + vnt4  ' Does vntResult = 11x4 or ERROR?

</PRE>The above examples would be much less ambiguous and easier to read, debug,
and maintain if the Visual Basic type conversion routines were used
instead. For Example:
<P>
<PRE>   iVar1 = 5 + val(sVar2)   ' use this (explicit conversion)
   vntVar1 = 5 + vntVar2    ' not this (implicit conversion)

</PRE><h3>Commenting Your Code</h3>
 
<P>
All procedures and functions should begin with a brief comment describing
the functional characteristics of the routine (what it does). This
description should not describe the implementation details (how it does it)
because these often change over time, resulting in unnecessary comment
maintenance work, or worse yet, erroneous comments. The code itself and any
necessary in-line or local comments will describe the implementation.
<P>
Parameters passed to a routine should be described when their functions are
not obvious and when the routine expects the parameters to be in a specific
range. Function return values and global variables that are changed by the
routine (especially through reference parameters) must also be described at
the beginning of each routine.
<P>
Routine header comment blocks should look like this (see the next section
"Formatting Your Code" for an example):
<P>
<PRE>Section    Comment Description
</PRE> 
<PRE>Purpose    What the routine does (not how).
Inputs     Each non-obvious parameter on a separate line with
           in-line comments
Assumes    List of each non-obvious external variable, control, open file,
           and so on.
Returns    Explanation of value returned for functions.
Effects    List of each effected external variable, control, file, and
           so on and the affect it has (only if this is not obvious)

</PRE>Every non-trivial variable declaration should include an in-line comment
describing the use of the variable being declared.
<P>
Variables, controls, and routines should be named clearly enough that in-
line commenting is only needed for complex or non-intuitive implementation
details.
<P>
An overview description of the application, enumerating primary data
objects, routines, algorithms, dialogs, database and file system
dependencies, and so on should be included at the start of the .BAS module
that contains the project's Visual Basic generic constant declarations.
<P>
NOTE: The Project window inherently describes the list of files in a
project, so this overview section only needs to provide information on the
most important files and modules, or the files the Project window doesn't
list, such as initialization (.INI) or database files.
<P>
<P><h3>Formatting Your Code</h3>
 
<P>
Because many programmers still use VGA displays, screen real estate must be
conserved as much as possible, while still allowing code formatting to
reflect logic structure and nesting.
<P>
Standard, tab-based, block nesting indentations should be two to four
spaces. More than four spaces is unnecessary and can cause statements to be
hidden or accidentally truncated. Less than two spaces does not
sufficiently show logic nesting. In the Microsoft Knowledge Base, we use a
three-space indent. Use the Environment Options dialog to set the default
tab width.
<P>
The functional overview comment of a routine should be indented one space.
The highest level statements that follow the overview comment should be
indented one tab, with each nested block indented an additional tab. For
example:
<P>
<PRE>'**************************************************************************
'Purpose:   Locate first occurrence of a specified user in UserList array.
'Inputs:    rasUserList():  the list of users to be searched
'           rsTargetUser:   the name of the user to search for
'Returns:   the index of the first occurrence of the rsTargetUser
'           in the rasUserList array. If target user not found, return -1.
'**************************************************************************

'VB3Line: Enter the following lines as one line
</PRE>Function iFindUser (rasUserList() As String, rsTargetUser as String) _
<PRE>   As Integer
   Dim i As Integer           ' loop counter
   Dim bFound As Integer      ' target found flag
   iFindUser = -1
   i = 0
   While i &lt;= Ubound(rasUserList) and Not bFound
      If rasUserList(i) = rsTargetUser Then
         bFound = True
         iFindUser = i
      End If
   Wend
</PRE>End Function
<P>
Variables and non-generic constants should be grouped by function rather
than by being split off into isolated areas or special files. Visual Basic
generic constants such as HOURGLASS should be grouped in a single module
(VB_STD.BAS) to keep them separate from application-specific declarations.
<P>
<P><h3>Operators</h3>
 
<P>
Always use an ampersand (&amp;) when concatenating strings, and use the plus
sign (+) when working with numerical values. Using a plus sign (+) with
non-numerical values, may cause problems when operating on two variants.
For example:
<P>
<PRE>   vntVar1 = "10.01"
   vntVar2 = 11
   vntResult = vntVar1 + vntVar2         ' vntResult =  21.01
   vntResult = vntVar1 &amp; vntVar2         ' vntResult = 10.0111

</PRE><h3>Scope</h3>
 
<P>
Variables should always be defined with the smallest scope possible.
Global variables can create enormously complex state machines and make the
logic of an application extremely difficult to understand. Global variables
also make the reuse and maintenance of your code much more difficult.
Variables in Visual Basic can have the following scope:
<P>
<PRE>Scope             Variable Declared In:            Visibility
</PRE> 
<PRE>Procedure-level   Event procedure, sub, or         Visible in the
                  function                         procedure in which
                                                   it is declared
Form-level,       Declarations section of a form   Visible in every
Module-level      or code module (.FRM, .BAS)      procedure in the
                                                   form or code
                                                   module
Global            Declarations section of a code   Always visible
                  module (.BAS, using Global
                  keyword)

</PRE>In a Visual Basic application, only use global variables when there is no
other convenient way to share data between forms. You may want to consider
storing information in a control's Tag property, which can be accessed
globally using the form.object.property syntax.
<P>
If you must use global variables, it is good practice to declare all of
them in a single module and group them by function. Give the module a
meaningful name that indicates its purpose, such as GLOBAL.BAS.
<P>
With the exception of global variables (which should not be passed),
procedures and functions should only operate on objects that are passed to
them. Global variables that are used in routines should be identified in
the general comment area at the beginning of the routine. In addition, pass
arguments to subs and functions using ByVal, unless you explicitly want to
change the value of the passed argument.
<P>
Write modular code whenever possible. For example, if your application
displays a dialog box, put all the controls and code required to perform
the dialog's task in a single form. This helps to keep the application's
code organized into useful components and minimizes its runtime overhead.
<P>
