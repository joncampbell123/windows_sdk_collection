<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, when you run a Visual Basic Sub procedure that
calls another procedure, you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Run-time error '28':
   Out of stack space

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This error message appears when one procedure in your module calls
another procedure, and that procedure calls another procedure, and so
on. The error message occurs in this case because when you call one
<PRE>sub procedure from another procedure, the first procedure is not
</PRE>unloaded from memory until the procedure that it called is finished.
Because of this behavior, if you continue to call a procedure from
another procedure, you may run out of stack space, or memory allotted
for the macro, before the last procedure is called.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, call individual sub procedures from one
main procedure, instead of calling one sub procedure from another sub
procedure, and so on. For example, if you are calling sub procedures
as in the following example
<P>
<PRE>   Sub one()
      two
   End Sub

   Sub two()
      three
   End Sub

   Sub three()
      four
   End Sub

</PRE>you can call these sub procedures from the first procedure as in the
following example:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub Main()
      one
      two
      three
      four
   End Sub

<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Visual Basic Reference indicates that the "Out of stack space" error
may be caused by too many active Function or Sub calls. To correct this
problem, Help suggests that you verify that general recursive procedures
are not nested too deeply and that they terminate properly.
