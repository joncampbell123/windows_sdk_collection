<P><h2>EXCERPT FROM THE TEXT OF WE1277.DOC</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
 
<P>
This Application Note will help you to learn the equivalent macro code
in Visual Basic for Applications for most Lotus 1-2-3 macro functions.
Through its example macros, this document will also help you to learn
some techniques for writing Visual Basic for Applications code that you
can use to perform various operations such as manipulating cells,
arrays, menus, worksheets, and workbooks.
<P>
For more information about how to use workbook, worksheet, and range
objects, see the Microsoft Excel Visual Basic Programming Reference
online Help or the "Visual Basic User's Guide."
