<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition has no menu option that enables you to
select all hyperlinks within a worksheet.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft provides programming examples for illustration only, without
warranty either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the
implied warranties of merchantability and/or fitness for a particular

language being demonstrated and the tools used to create and debug
procedures. Microsoft support engineers can help explain the functionality
of a particular procedure, but they will not modify these examples to
provide added functionality or construct procedures to meet your specific
needs. If you have limited programming experience, you may want to contact
the Microsoft fee-based consulting line at (800) 936-5200. For more
information about the support options available from Microsoft, please see
the following page on the World Wide Web:
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/support/supportnet/refguide/default.asp">http://www.microsoft.com/support/supportnet/refguide/default.asp</A></B>

</PRE>It is possible to use a Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications subroutine
to cycle through all of the hyperlinks within a worksheet and perform a
specific operation on each hyperlink. For example, you could delete all of
the hyperlinks, or you could simply report the location of each hyperlink.

<OL><P><LI>Create a new workbook in Microsoft Excel.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, point to Macro, and then click Visual Basic Editor.

<P><LI>In the Visual Basic Editor, click Module on the Insert menu.

<P><LI>Type the following code into the module:
<P>
<P><PRE>      'This Sub procedure deletes all hyperlinks in the active worksheet.
<PRE></PRE>      Sub DeleteAllHyperlinks()
          For Each xLink In ActiveSheet.Hyperlinks
              xLink.Delete
          Next xLink
      End Sub

      'This Sub procedure displays a series of message boxes indicating
      'the location of each hyperlink in the active worksheet.
      Sub ReportHyperlinkLocations()
          For Each xLink In ActiveSheet.Hyperlinks
              MsgBox xLink.Range.Address
          Next xLink
      End Sub

      'This Sub procedure identifies each hyperlink and asks if you want
      'to delete it. If you click Yes, the hyperlink is deleted.
      Sub ReportAndDeleteHyperlinks()
          For Each xLink In ActiveSheet.Hyperlinks
              Response = MsgBox("Delete hyperlink in cell " &amp; _
                  xLink.Range.Address &amp; " ?", vbYesNo)
              If Response = vbYes Then xLink.Delete
          Next xLink
      End Sub

      'This Sub procedure selects all cells in the worksheet that contain
      'hyperlinks. You can then clear the selected cells to delete all of
      'the hyperlinks.
      Sub SelectAllHyperlinkCells()
          FirstCell = 1
          For Each xLink In ActiveSheet.Hyperlinks
              If FirstCell = 1 Then
                  Set xRange = xLink.Range
                  FirstCell = 0
              Else
                  Set xRange = Application.Union(xRange, xLink.Range)
              End If
          Next xLink
          xRange.Select
      End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>On the File menu, click "Close and Return To Microsoft Excel."
<P>
</OL>If you insert some hyperlinks into your worksheet, you can try running the
different macros by pointing to Macro on the Tools menu and clicking
Macros. Then, select the name of the macro to run, and click Run.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Go To Special dialog box in Microsoft Excel enables you to select cells
or objects in a worksheet in several different combinations. For example,
you can select all objects in a worksheet, or select all cells that contain
conditional formats or comments.
<P>
To use the Go To Special dialog box, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Edit menu, click Go To.

<P><LI>Click Special.
<P>
</OL>The Go To Special dialog box does not offer the choice of selecting all
cells that contain hyperlinks. Because of this, you may encounter some
difficulty when working with large numbers of hyperlinks; for example, if
you want to delete all hyperlinks from your worksheet, there is no way to
do this without using a macro.
<P>
<P><h2>REFERENCES</h2>
 
<P>
For more information about hyperlinks, click Contents And Index on the Help
menu (or on the Balloon Help menu if you are using a version of the
Macintosh operating system earlier than 8.0), click the Index button in MS
Excel Help, type the following text
<P>
<PRE>   hyperlinks, creating

</PRE></OL>and then click Show Topics. Select the " Create a hyperlink" topic, and
click Go To. If you are unable to find the information you need, ask the
Office Assistant.
