<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you record a macro in which you change the font of a cell comment, and
then subsequently rerun the macro, the font of the comment does not change
as you expected.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Depending on the method you used to select the comment while recording the
macro, your recorded macro may not contain the necessary code to modify the
font of the cell comment.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>

needs. If you have limited programming experience, you may want to contact

information about the support options available from Microsoft, please see
the following page on the World Wide Web:
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/supportnet/refguide/">http://www.microsoft.com/supportnet/refguide/</A></B>

</PRE>The following sample macro changes the font of the active cell's comment to
Courier, Bold with a size of 14:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub Comment_Font_Change()
       With ActiveCell.Comment.Shape.TextFrame.Characters.Font
           .Name = "courier"
           .Size = 14
           .Bold = True
       End With
   End Sub

</PRE>You can also change the font of all comments in a worksheet by running the
following macro:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub All_Comment_Font_Change()
       For Each x In ActiveSheet.Comments
           With x.Shape.TextFrame.Characters.Font
               .Name = "courier"
               .Size = 14
               .Bold = True
           End With
       Next x
   End Sub

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This is by design of Microsoft Excel.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Depending on how you select a cell comment, a different version of the
Format Comment dialog box appears when you click Comment on the Format
menu. If you have the comment frame selected, and the cursor is not within
the comment text, then the Format Comment dialog box displays seven tabs:
Font, Alignment, Colors and Lines, Size, Protection, Properties, and
Margins. However, if the cursor is flashing within the comment text, you
are in edit mode, and the Format Comment dialog box will display just one
tab: Font.
<P>
If you record a macro in which you change the font while in Edit mode, the
recorded macro does not produce the necessary code for modifying the
comment font. The following code is representative of a macro recorded
while changing the comment font in Edit mode:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub Macro1()
       Range("A1").Comment.Shape.Select True
       Range("A1").Comment.Text Text:="Username:" &amp; Chr(10) &amp; _
           "this is a test"
       Range("A2").Select
   End Sub
