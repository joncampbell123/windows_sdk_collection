The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 3.x, 4.x, 5.0, 5.0c
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows NT, version 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
You can create an embedded chart object using the chart tool on the
Standard Toolbar. You must create an embedded chart in the instance of
Microsoft Excel that contains the supporting data. The embedded chart is
then dynamically linked to this data.
<P>
To add a legend, title, etc. to your embedded chart, you must activate the
chart object. You can do this by double-clicking anywhere on the chart
object. In Microsoft Excel version 5.0, when you activate an embedded
chart, a hatched border appears around the chart and you can format the
chart elements.
<P>
In Microsoft Excel versions 3.0 and 4.0, when you activate an embedded
chart, a copy of the chart object opens in a new window. This new window
displays the chart menu bar, allowing you to format the chart elements. The
embedded chart on the worksheet immediately reflects all changes made to
the copy in the window.
<P>
You can also activate an embedded chart object using a macro as in the
following examples:
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Excel version 5.0 Visual Basic Example</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   ' Dimension variable
   Dim Data As String
   ' Assign variable Data to selected cells
   Data = Selection.Address
   ' Create embedded chart from selected data
   ActiveSheet.ChartObjects.Add(82.8, 76.8, 321.6, 100.2).Select
   ActiveChart.ChartWizard Source:=Range(Data)
   ' Activate embedded chart for editing
   Selection.Activate

underscore character (_) indicates that code continues from one line
to the next. You can type lines that contain this character as one
logical line or you can divide the lines of code and include the line
continuation character. For more information about Visual Basic for

Manual" section in the "Document Conventions" section of the "Visual
Basic User's Guide."

<P><h3>Microsoft Excel versions 3.0 and 4.0 Macro</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   A1: =COPY()
   A2: =CREATE.OBJECT(5,!$B$5,5,5,!$D$15,5,5)
   A3: =DEFINE.NAME("Temp")
   A4: =GET.NAME("!Temp")
   A5: worksheet=GET.DOCUMENT(1)
   A6: =UNHIDE(worksheet&amp;" "&amp;A2)
   A7: =RETURN()

</PRE>This macro does the following:

<OL><P><LI>Copies the selected data for the chart from the worksheet

<P><LI>Creates the embedded chart

<P><LI>Assigns the name "Temp" to the chart object

<P><LI>Gets the definition of the name "Temp"

<P><LI>Assigns the name "worksheet" to the name of the worksheet

<P><LI>Activates the chart object
<P>
</OL>Microsoft provides macro examples for illustration only, without warranty
either expressed or implied, including but not limited to the implied
warranties of merchantability and/or fitness for a particular purpose. This
macro is provided 'as is' and Microsoft does not guarantee that the
following code can be used in all situations. Microsoft does not support
modifications of that code to suit specific customer requirements.
