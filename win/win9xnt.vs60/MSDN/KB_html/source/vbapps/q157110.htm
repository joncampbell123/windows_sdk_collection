The information in this article applies to:

<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 97, if you use a Visual Basic for Applications macro to
format either the x error bars or the y error bars within an xy scatter
chart, the formatting is applied to both sets of error bars.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This occurs because it is not possible for a Visual Basic for Applications
macro command to individually select either the x error bars or the y error
bars. Selecting one set selects the other set as well.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft provides examples of Visual Basic for Applications procedures for
illustration only, without warranty either expressed or implied, including,
but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and/or fitness
for a particular purpose. The Visual Basic procedures in this article are
provided 'as is' and Microsoft does not guarantee that they can be used in
all situations. While Microsoft support engineers can help explain the
functionality of a particular macro, they will not modify these examples to
provide added functionality, nor will they help you construct macros to
meet your specific needs. If you have limited programming experience, you
may want to consult one of the Microsoft Solution Providers. Solution
Providers offer a wide range of fee-based services, including creating
fscustom macros. For more information about Microsoft Solution Providers,
call Microsoft Customer Information Service at (800) 426-9400.
<P>
It is possible to select one or the other set of error bars by using a
Microsoft Excel version 4.0 macro language (XLM) command within your Visual
Basic subroutine.
<P>
To select the x error bars for the first series in the active chart, use
the following command:
<P>
<PRE>   Application.ExecuteExcel4Macro ("SELECT(""Series 1 X Error Bars"")")

</PRE>To select the y error bars for the first series in the active chart, use
this command:
<P>
<PRE>   Application.ExecuteExcel4Macro ("SELECT(""Series 1 Y Error Bars"")")

</PRE>After the set of error bars is selected, you can format it by using Visual
Basic code similar to the following:
<P>
<PRE>   With Selection.Border
       .LineStyle = xlContinuous
       .ColorIndex = 3
       .Weight = xlThin
   End With

</PRE>Or you can delete the selected set of error bars by using this Visual Basic
command:
<P>
<PRE>   Selection.Delete

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 97, if you select either the x error bars or the y error
bars in a chart while you record a Visual Basic for Applications macro, the
following code is recorded:
<P>
<PRE>   ActiveChart.SeriesCollection(1).ErrorBars.Select

</PRE>The recorded code is exactly the same, whether you select the x error bars
or the y error bars.
<P>
It is not possible to individually select one or the other set of error
bars unless you remove the command shown above and replace it with one of
the two Microsoft Excel 4.0 macro commands shown in the Workaround section
of this article.
