<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 97, the NoteText method of a cell is limited to a
maximum length of 255 characters. This article explains how to work around
this limitation and some of the related problems that you may encounter
when you work with cell comments.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>

</PRE><h3>Working Around the 255 Character Limitation of the NoteText Method</h3>
 
<P>
Although the NoteText method of a cell is limited to a maximum of 255
characters, you can apply a comment that is up to 32,767 characters in
length to a cell. To do this, use the Text method of a Comment object that
is attached to the cell. For example, instead of the following code
<P>
<PRE>   ActiveCell.NoteText "This is a 1000 character comment."

</PRE>use a line of code similar to the following:
<P>
<PRE>   ActiveCell.Comment.Text "This is a 1000 character comment."

</PRE><h3>Using the NoteText Method with Comments Longer Than 255 Characters</h3>
 
<P>
If you use the NoteText method to apply a comment that is longer than 255
characters in length to a cell, the new comment is not applied to the cell,
and you do not receive an error message.
<P>
For example, if you run a macro with the following code
<P>
<PRE>   ActiveCell.NoteText String(256, "x")

</PRE>and the active cell does not already contain a comment, no comment is added
to the cell because the length of the new comment would exceed 255
characters.
<P>
If you run a macro with the following code
<P>
<PRE>   ActiveCell.NoteText ActiveCell.NoteText &amp; String(100, "x")

</PRE>and the length of the existing comment exceeds 155 characters, the comment
is not updated because the length of the new comment would exceed 255
characters.
<P>
NOTE: In earlier versions of Microsoft Excel, the first 255 characters of
text are applied to the comment; the remaining characters are truncated.
<P>
<P><h3>Using Comment.Text to Change the Comment Applied to a Cell</h3>
 
<P>
When you use Comment.Text to change the comment applied to a cell, the cell
must already have a comment applied to it. If no comment was previously
applied to the cell, you receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Run-time error '91':
   Object variable or With block variable not set

</PRE>To apply a comment to a cell, use code similar to the following:
<P>
<PRE>   ActiveCell.AddComment

</PRE>NOTE: If the active cell already has a comment applied to it, you receive
the following error message when you run the code:
<P>
<PRE>   Run-time error '1004':
   Application-defined or object-defined error

</PRE>To add a comment to a cell that may or may not contain a comment, use code
similar to the following:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub AddACommentToTheActiveCell()

       ' The following line suppresses the run-time error message when
       ' adding a comment to a cell.
       On Error Resume Next

       ' Add a comment to the cell. If the cell already contains a comment,
       ' this line does nothing.
       ActiveCell.AddComment

       ' Return to normal error handling.
       On Error GoTo 0

       ' Add the text to the comment. If the cell already contains a
       ' comment, this is all you actually need.
       ActiveCell.Comment.Text "This is a comment."

   End Sub

</PRE><h3>Using Comment.Text to Add New Text to an Existing Comment</h3>
 
<P>
If you want to add new text to an existing comment while preserving the
original comment text, use a line of code similar to the following:
<P>
<PRE>   ActiveCell.Comment.Text ActiveCell.Comment.Text &amp; "New Comment Text"

</PRE>Characters over the 32,767 character limit for comments are truncated.
