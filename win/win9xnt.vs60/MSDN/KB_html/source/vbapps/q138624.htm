The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, version 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0
</UL>

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use Visual Basic for applications to enter text into the active
cell, and you use the SendKeys command to set the active cell to edit mode,
the macro will fail when it is run from the shortcut key assigned to the
macro.
<P>
Note, however, that the macro works correctly if you run it from a button
or by clicking Macro on the Tools menu.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when you invoke the macro by using the shortcut key
CTRL+&lt;key&gt; (where &lt;key&gt; is the key assigned to the macro&gt;). The SendKeys
statement is run immediately in this macro. Because it is extremely
unlikely that you will be able to release the CTRL key before the SendKeys
is executed, a key combination of CTRL+F2 is sent to Microsoft Excel, which
brings up the information window.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To avoid this problem, add a wait period of one second before the SendKeys
command is executed. This allows the macro to execute properly.
<P>
Microsoft provides examples of Visual Basic for applications procedures for

but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and/or fitness

<P>
<P><h3>Sample Macro</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   Sub Test()
      ActiveCell.Formula = "ANY TEXT"
      Application.Wait (Now() + TimeValue("00:00:01"))
      SendKeys "{f2}", False
   End Sub

</PRE>NOTE: When you run this macro, you must release the CTRL key before the one
second delay is over or the Information Window will be displayed.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Wait method pauses a macro that is running until a specified time is
reached. The Wait method suspends all Microsoft Excel activity and may
prevent you from performing other operations on your computer. Background
processes, such as printing and recalculation, are continued.
