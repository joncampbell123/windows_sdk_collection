The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0c
<LI>Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, versions 5.0, 5.0a
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, versions 7.0, 7.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Excel keeps track of all the cells that you use in a worksheet by
using an "activecell" table (also called a "dependency" table). In some
cases, the last cell in this table may refer to a cell that is outside of
the worksheet area that you are using. When this occurs, random access
memory (RAM) or printing problems may result. You may be able to correct
these problems by resetting the last cell in the table so that it falls
within the area of the sheet that you are actually using.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is changed in Excel 97 and Excel 98. When you save the 
workbook, the last cell pointer is automatically updated to reflect the 
last cell that contains data.
<P>
To reset the last cell address in the versions of Microsoft Excel listed at
the beginning of this article, you can use either of the following methods
to clear the unnecessary information (data and formatting) from the unused
columns and rows of the worksheet. After you remove the extraneous
information, save the sheet to force Microsoft Excel to rebuild the
"activecell" table.
<P>
NOTE: When you use either method, you may receive an "Out of Memory"
message as Microsoft Excel attempts to clear and delete the selected range.
If you receive this error message, use smaller row or column ranges when
you clear data.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1</h3>
 
<P>
Use the following steps to reset the last cell by manually deleting excess
rows and columns:

<OL><P><LI>Select all rows or columns that do not contain data by selecting the
   appropriate row or column headings.
<P>
   TIP: One way to do this is to press F5 and type the appropriate
   reference (F:IV for columns or 5:16384 for rows).

<P><LI>On the Edit menu, click Clear, and then click All.

<P><LI>On the Edit menu, click Delete.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Save (click Save As if you want to keep the
   original file).
<P>
