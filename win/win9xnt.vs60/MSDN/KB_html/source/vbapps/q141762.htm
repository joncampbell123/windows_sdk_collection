<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you create macros or applications using Microsoft Visual Basic for
Applications, it is often necessary to run through a section of code
several times. Visual Basic for Applications provides several methods
with which to repeat, or "loop" through, a section of code.
<P>
This article provides sample code that illustrates the use of the various 
looping structures and algorithms that Visual Basic for Applications 
provides.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>

</PRE>When you are deciding which looping structure to use, there are several
considerations to be aware of. For example:
<P>
<PRE>   Do I know exactly how many times I want to loop through the code?

   If so, how many?

   If not, is there a specific condition on which I want the macro to
   exit the loop? If the loop is conditional, do I want to test the
   condition before or after the code is executed?

</PRE><h3>Sample Visual Basic Procedures</h3>
 
<P>
The following examples demonstrate the various looping structures
available in Visual Basic for Applications. Unless otherwise indicated,
the examples assume a cell or range of cells is selected. Some other
things to note:

<UL><LI>Within each example, the message box function (MsgBox) is used to
   display information. In these examples, wherever a MsgBox function
   occurs is where you should enter the code to be repeated through each
   iteration of the loop.

<LI>Some of the comments in the code describe alternative methods for
   accomplishing a particular task or for doing different tasks with
   similar code.

<LI>The tilde (~) symbol used within some of the comments should be replaced
   with the name of the indicated object [the object enclosed in quotation
   marks, for example worksheets("sheet1")], or the object's index number.
<P>
</UL><h3>For...Each...Next</h3>
 
<P>
This example uses a For...Each...Next statement to loop through all the
cells in a selected range (the comments show an alternative method):
<P>
<PRE>   ' To show the contents of each cell in a selection or specific range.
   Sub for_each_demo()

      ' Or, use "In Worksheet(~).Range(~)" to specify a specific range.
      For Each cell In Selection

         ' Displays cell contents in message box.
         MsgBox cell.Value

         ' Reset cell to next object.
      Next
   End Sub

</PRE><h3>For &lt;variable&gt; = &lt;n1&gt; to &lt;n2&gt;</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   ' This example loops through the code a specified number of times.
   Sub for_demo()

      ' Sets x to 1, adds 1 to x until x = 5, loops 5 times.
      For x = 1 To 5 Step 1

         ' Displays value of x in msgbox.
         MsgBox x

         ' Returns to top of loop 4 times.
      Next
   End Sub

</PRE><h3>Do...Until with Test at Beginning of Loop</h3>
 
<P>
This example uses a Do...Until loop to "walk" down a column of cells
until the first empty cell is reached. Because the macro performs the
test at the beginning of the loop, if the first cell is empty, the code
inside the loop will not be run.
<P>
<PRE>   ' Performs Do loop, testing at top of loop.
   ' Loops until empty cell is reached.
   ' Note that you can also use a Do While Not IsEmpty(ActiveCell) loop.

   Sub test_before_do_loop()

      ' Test contents of active cell; if active cell is empty, exit loop.
      Do Until IsEmpty(ActiveCell)

         ' Displays cell contents in message box.
         MsgBox ActiveCell.Value

         ' Step down 1 row to the next cell.
         ActiveCell.Offset(1, 0).Select

        ' Return to top of loop.
      Loop
   End Sub

</PRE><h3>Do...Until with Test at End of Loop</h3>
 
<P>
This example also uses a Do loop, but it tests at the bottom of the
loop. The first line of the macro tests the first cell. Without the
first line of code to test the initial cell, the code would execute at
least one time, because the loop tests at the bottom.
<P>
<PRE>   ' Performs Do loop, testing at bottom of loop.

   Sub test_after_do_loop()

      ' Test to see if first cell is empty.
      If IsEmpty(ActiveCell) Then Exit Sub

         ' Begin loop.
         Do

            ' Displays cell contents in message box.
            MsgBox ActiveCell.Value

            ' Steps down one row to the next cell.
            ActiveCell.Offset(1, 0).Select

            ' Test contents of active cell; if empty, exit loop
            ' or Loop While Not IsEmpty(ActiveCell).

         Loop Until IsEmpty(ActiveCell)
      End Sub

</PRE>CAUTION: Do not branch into the body of a While...Wend loop without
executing the While statement. Doing so may cause run-time errors or
other problems that are difficult to locate.
<P>
The Do...Loop statement provides a more structured and flexible way to
perform looping. The While...Wend loop is included in Visual Basic for
Applications for backward compatibility.
<P>
<P><h3>While...Wend Loop</h3>
 
<P>
NOTE: The While...Wend loop is included in Visual Basic for Applications
for backward compatibility.
<P>
This example uses a While...Wend loop. This loop tests at the top of
the loop only.
<P>
<PRE>   ' Performs While loop, testing at top of the loop.
   Sub While_loop_demo()

      ' Sets condition of loop, while active cell is not empty.
      While Not IsEmpty(ActiveCell)

         ' Displays cell contents in message box.
         MsgBox ActiveCell.Value

         ' Step down one row to the next cell.
         ActiveCell.Offset(1, 0).Select

      ' End While loop.
      Wend
   End Sub

</PRE><h3>If...Then..GoTo Loop</h3>
 
<P>
This example creates a loop by using "If &lt;condition&gt; Then GoTo &lt;line
label&gt;" structure. This structure is tested at the bottom of the loop.
<P>
<PRE>   Sub loop_using_goto()

      ' Test to see if first cell is empty.
      If IsEmpty(ActiveCell) Then Exit Sub

      ' Line label indicating top of loop.
   top:

      ' Displays cell contents in message box.
      MsgBox ActiveCell.Value

      ' Step down one row to the next cell.
      ActiveCell.Offset(1, 0).Select

      ' Test to see if new cell is empty.
      If Not IsEmpty(ActiveCell) Then GoTo top

   End Sub
