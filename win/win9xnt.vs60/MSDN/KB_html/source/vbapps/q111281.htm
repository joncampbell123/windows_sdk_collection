<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0c
<LI>Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, versions 5.0, 5.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel version 5.0, you cannot define a new name that is the
same as the name of a currently running Microsoft Visual Basic for 
Applications subroutine. If you attempt to do so, you will receive the 
following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Run-time error '1004':
   Add method of Names class failed

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This is a known problem in Microsoft Excel 5.0. This problem was corrected 
in Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0 and later.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you run a Visual Basic subroutine, Microsoft Excel creates a temporary
name for the subroutine in memory. As long as this temporary name exists,
it is not possible to define a new name that is the same as the temporary
name. You can, however, redefine an existing name.
<P>
If you attempt to define a new name while an identically named subroutine
is running, you will receive the error message shown above.
<P>

</PRE>The following subroutines illustrate the various types of situations that 
may cause this error to occur. Enter the following subroutines into a new 
module sheet in a new workbook.
<P>
To run the subroutines, position the cursor in the Sub line for the 
subroutine you want to run and either press the F5 key or choose Start from
the Run menu.
<P>
<PRE>   'The Test1 subroutine will fail if the name "Test1" does not already
   'exist in the workbook.

   'The Test2 subroutine runs the MakeName subroutine, which attempts to
   'define the name "Test2". As with the above subroutine, it will fail if
   'the name "Test2" does not already exist in the workbook.
