<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how you can display a dialog box while a macro is
running in the background. The purpose of displaying a dialog box is to
alert the user that the application is busy while your macro is running.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the Show method to display a UserForm, the UserForm is shown
"modal"; that is, the user must respond to the UserForm before using any
other part of the application. After a UserForm is loaded, no subsequent
code is executed until the UserForm is either hidden or unloaded.
<P>
To display a dialog box and allow the macro to run in the background, you
can run your macro in the Activate event of the UserForm. When the UserForm
is shown, the Activate event is triggered and your macro will run while the
UserForm is shown on the screen. The following steps illustrate how you can
accomplish this:

   Explorer.

<P><LI>Select the project that you created in the previous steps.

<P><LI>Right-click the "Processing_Dialog" UserForm and click Export File.
   Save the UserForm as "Processing_Dialog.frm."

<P><LI>Right-click the "Processing_Code" Module and click Export File. Save
   the module as "Processing_Code.bas."

<P><LI>Return to Microsoft Excel and open the workbook in which you would like
   to use the "Processing, Please Wait" dialog box.

<P><LI>Activate the Visual Basic Editor.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Import File, select the "Processing_Dialog.frm"
   file, and click Open.

   Code window:
<P>
<PRE>      Sub Main()
         StartProcessing "&lt;message text&gt;", "&lt;macro name&gt;"
      End Sub

   Where the &lt;message text&gt; argument is the text string that you want to
   display in the Processing_Dialog dialog box and &lt;macro name&gt; is the
   macro that you would like to run after the dialog box appears. To show
   the dialog box and run the macro indicated by "&lt;macro name&gt;", run the
   macro Main.
