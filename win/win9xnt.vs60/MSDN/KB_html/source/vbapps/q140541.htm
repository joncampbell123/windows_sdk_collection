The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, when you programmatically protect a worksheet so
that you can make changes only with a Visual Basic for Applications macro,
and then run a macro, the following error message may appear:
<P>
<PRE>   Run-time error '1004':
   Add method of &lt;object&gt; class failed.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>You use the Protect method for the worksheet and set the
   UserInterfaceOnly argument to True.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>You run a macro that attempts to add a drawing object to the worksheet.
<P>
</UL>Drawing objects include graphic objects, pictures, embedded objects, and
embedded charts.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft provides examples of Visual Basic for Applications procedures for
illustration only, without warranty either expressed or implied, including,
but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and/or fitness
for a particular purpose. The Visual Basic procedures in this article are
provided 'as is' and Microsoft does not guarantee that they can be used in
all situations. While Microsoft support engineers can help explain the
functionality of a particular macro, they will not modify these examples to
provide added functionality, nor will they help you construct macros to
meet your specific needs. If you have limited programming experience, you
may want to consult one of the Microsoft Solution Providers. Solution
Providers offer a wide range of fee-based services, including creating
custom macros. For more information about Microsoft Solution Providers,
call Microsoft Customer Information Service at (800) 426-9400.
<P>
To work around this problem, unprotect the worksheet before adding the
drawing object, and then reprotect the sheet, as in the following
example:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub AddObject()

      'Unprotect the Sheet.
      ActiveSheet.Unprotect password:="pwd"

      'Add a drawing object.
      ActiveSheet.Rectangles.Add 0, 0, 100, 100

      'Protect the sheet again with "UserInterFaceOnly."
      ActiveSheet.Protect password:="pwd", userinterfaceonly:=True

      'The macro can continue making changes to the "UserInterfaceOnly"
      'protected worksheet other than adding drawing objects.
      ActiveSheet.Range("A10").Value = "Hello World"

   End Sub

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
