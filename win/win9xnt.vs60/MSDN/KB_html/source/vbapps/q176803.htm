<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The LibraryPath property of the Application object in Microsoft Visual
Basic for Applications works slightly differently in Microsoft Excel for
Windows than it does in Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh. This article
explains the differences and how to avoid problems when using the
LibraryPath property in your Visual Basic macros and procedures.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
You can use the LibraryPath property in Visual Basic macros and procedures
in Microsoft Excel to return the path to the Library folder. The Library
folder is the folder where most add-ins included with Microsoft Excel are
stored.
<P>
In Microsoft Excel for Windows, the LibraryPath property appears similar to
the following:
<P>
<PRE>   C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\Library

</PRE>Note that there is no trailing separator (in this case, a backslash) at the
end of the path.
<P>
However, in Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, the LibraryPath property
appears similar to the following:
<P>
<PRE>   Macintosh HD:Microsoft Office:Microsoft Excel 5:Macro Library:

   -or-

   Macintosh HD:Microsoft Office 98:Office:Excel Add-Ins:

</PRE>Note that there is a trailing separator (in this case, a colon) at the end 
of the path. This may cause problems if you are writing code that is 
intended to work in both Microsoft Excel for Windows and Microsoft Excel 
for the Macintosh.
<P>
You can prevent problems from occurring by programmatically removing the 
trailing separator from the LibraryPath before you use it. The following 
example demonstrates one way in which this may be done. 
<P>

</PRE><h3>Sample Visual Basic Procedure</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   Sub GetGoodLibraryPath()

      ' Store the LibraryPath in a variable.
      xLibraryPath = Application.LibraryPath

      ' If the LibraryPath ends in a colon...
      If Right(xLibraryPath, 1) = ":" Then

         ' ...remove the colon from the end of the path.
         xLibraryPath = Left(xLibraryPath, Len(xLibraryPath) - 1)

      End If

      ' Display the corrected LibraryPath.
      MsgBox "The application's LibraryPath is " &amp; xLibraryPath

   End Sub

</PRE>Once you have corrected the LibraryPath, you can use the PathSeparator
property to add either a backslash or a colon to the end of the path, and
then add a file name after the separator. Following is an example:
<P>
<PRE>   xFilePath = xLibraryPath &amp; Application.PathSeparator &amp; "Addin.xla"

</PRE>If you use the PathSeparator property when the LibraryPath has not been
corrected, you may receive an error message when you run the macro in
Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh.
