The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0c

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you call a macro that is contained in an add-in file, either by using
the Call statement or by using the macro name in a Visual Basic procedure
in Microsoft Excel, you receive one of the following error messages, even
if the add-in that contains the macro is open at the time:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub or Function not defined

   -or-

   Compile error:
   Sub or Function not defined

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs when the add-in that contains the macro that you are
calling is not selected in the References dialog box. When you open an add-
in file, the add-in is added to the References dialog box, but is not
selected. This is by design of Microsoft Excel.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
To avoid receiving an error message when you call a macro that is contained
in an add-in file from a Visual Basic procedure, do either of the
following:

<UL><LI>Open the add-in file (either before you run the macro, or as a command
   in the macro), and then use the Run method of the Application object to
   run the macro as in the following example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Application.Run("ADDIN.XLA!Macro_Name")
</PRE><P>
   -or-

<LI>Reference the add-in from the procedure that is calling the add-in macro
   with the following steps. (Note that when you use this procedure, the
   path to the add-in file is hard-coded in the module, so that in order
   to run the procedure, the add-in file must be located in the same
   directory as when you referenced it.)
<P>
   1. Activate the module that contains the procedure that is running the
<P><PRE>      add-in macro.
</PRE><P>
   2. On the Tools menu, click References.
<P>
   3. If the add-in that contains the macro you want to run is listed in
<P><PRE>      the Available References list box, select (check) its checkbox. Click
      OK, and skip step 4.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      If the add-in that contains the macro you want to run is NOT listed
      under Available References, click Browse.
</PRE><P>
   4. From the File Name list, select the add-in you want to reference and
<P><PRE>      click OK. Click OK again.
</PRE><P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the References dialog box to directly reference another
workbook, add-in, or object library file, you can run a macro contained in
the referenced file using the Call statement and the macro name, or only
the macro name.
<P>
For more information about running a macro that is contained in an add-in,
query on the following words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
