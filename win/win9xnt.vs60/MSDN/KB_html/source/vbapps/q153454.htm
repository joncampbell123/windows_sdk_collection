<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, if you have a workbook with defined names that refer to
different worksheets and you then delete those worksheets, you will receive
a #REF!&lt;cell reference&gt; error in the defined names dialog box. You can only
delete the reference errors individually using the Define Name dialog box.
However, you can use a Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications procedure to 
delete all defined name reference errors within the active workbook.

</PRE>To delete #REF! errors in defined names, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Create a new workbook with at least two sheets.

<P><LI>Select cell A1 in Sheet2.

<P><LI>On the Insert menu, point to Name, and then click Define.

<P><LI>In the Define Name dialog box, type "myname" (without the quotation
   marks) in the Names In Workbook box, and then click OK.
<P>
   This creates a defined name that refers to cell A1 in Sheet2.

<P><LI>Delete Sheet2.
<P>
   This makes the defined name "myname" refer to =#REF!$A$1.

<P><LI>Type the following code in a new module sheet.
<P>
<P><PRE>      ' This procedure deletes every named range in which the RefersTo
      ' argument contains #REF!, where #REF! begins at the second character
      ' and ends at the fifth.
</PRE><P>
<PRE>      Sub Delete_Every_Named_Range_With_A_Reference_Error()
         Dim nm As Object
         Dim mystr As String

         ' Loops through each name in the active workbook.
         For Each nm In ActiveWorkbook.Names

            ' Check for #REF! in the defined name reference.
            If InStr(1, nm.RefersTo, "#REF!") Then

               ' Delete the defined name if it is a match.
               nm.Delete

            End If
         Next
      End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>Run the macro.
<P>
   The defined name "myname" is deleted from the workbook.
<P></OL>
