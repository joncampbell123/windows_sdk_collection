<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you work in a Microsoft Excel worksheet, you may want to make the
current work item bold to make it easier to read. This article contains a
sample Visual Basic for Applications macro that makes the font of the
current row bold.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The example uses the SelectionChange event of the worksheet to change the
font of the current row. Each time you make a new selection on the
worksheet, the entire row that contains the selection become bold.
<P>
NOTE: When you select a range that contains more than one row, only the row
containing the active cell becomes bold.
<P>
Microsoft provides examples of Visual Basic for Applications procedures for

for a particular purpose. The Visual Basic procedures in this article are
provided 'as is' and Microsoft does not guarantee that they can be used in
all situations. While Microsoft support engineers can help explain the
functionality of a particular macro, they will not modify these examples to
provide added functionality, nor will they help you construct macros to
meet your specific needs. If you have limited programming experience, you
may want to consult one of the Microsoft Solution Providers. Solution
Providers offer a wide range of fee-based services, including creating
custom macros. For more information about Microsoft Solution Providers,

<P>
To change the font of the current row by using the sample macro, follow
these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Create a new workbook.

<P><LI>Start the Visual Basic Editor (press ALT+F11).

<P><LI>If the Project window is not visible, click Project Explorer on the
   View menu (or press CTRL+R).

<P><LI>In the Project Explorer, double-click Sheet1.

<P><LI>In the Module window that is opened for Sheet1, click Worksheet in the
   Object list and SelectionChange in the Procedure list.

<P><LI>In the module for Sheet1, type the following code for the Worksheet
   SelectionChange Event:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Dim x as Long
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      Private Sub Worksheet_SelectionChange(ByVal Target As Excel.Range)
</PRE><P>
<PRE>          ' Set the row containing the active cell to bold.
          ActiveCell.EntireRow.Font.Bold = True

          ' Check for first execution of the macro and set row value
          ' if it is:
          If x = Empty Then
              x = ActiveCell.Row

          ' Set previous row property back to normal, or not bold.
          ElseIf Not x = ActiveCell.Row Then
             Rows(x).EntireRow.Font.Bold = False
          End If

          ' Capture new row value for comparison against next selection.
          x = ActiveCell.Row

      End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>Stitch to Microsoft Excel (press ALT+F11).

<P><LI>Select a cell anywhere on Sheet1.
<P>
</OL>The entire row in which the active cell is located becomes bold. When you
select a new cell, the old row changes back to the normal font, and the new
row becomes bold.
<P>
NOTE: As a result of using the SelectionChange event and the macro assigned
to it, you may not be able to use some editing features, for example the
Copy command.
