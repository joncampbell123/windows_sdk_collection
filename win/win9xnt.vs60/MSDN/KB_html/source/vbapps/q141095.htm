<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, if you have a macro that prints a range of cells on 
your worksheet, it may not print all of your data if you have inserted rows 
within the range specified in your macro. However, if rather than hard-
coding a specific range of cells to print, you instead use a print area 
that refers to a defined name on your worksheet, you can create a print 
macro that automatically adjusts to any additional rows you insert into the 
range.
<P>

language being demonstrated and the tools used to create and debug
procedures. Microsoft support engineers can help explain the functionality
of a particular procedure, but they will not modify these examples to
provide added functionality or construct procedures to meet your specific
needs. If you have limited programming experience, you may want to contact
the Microsoft fee-based consulting line at (800) 936-5200. For more

the following page on the World Wide Web:
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/support/supportnet/refguide/default.asp">http://www.microsoft.com/support/supportnet/refguide/default.asp</A></B>

</PRE>To follow the example provided in this article, enter any text information
into the cell range A1:D5 on Sheet1 of a new workbook.
<P>
If you record a macro that selects the range of cells, sets the print area,
and then prints the worksheet, you create a macro similar to the following:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub Macro1()
      Range("A1:D5").Select
      ActiveSheet.PageSetup.PrintArea = Selection.Address
      ActiveWindow.SelectedSheets.PrintOut Copies:=1
   End Sub

</PRE>The problem with this macro is that if you insert one or more rows within
this range of cells, and then rerun the recorded macro, it still prints
only the range specified in the macro. The macro does not print any rows
that were moved down because of the row or rows that you inserted.
<P>
In order to have your macro automatically adjust when you insert or delete
rows within the range you want to print, create a defined name for the
range, and then use the defined name in your macro. For this example, you
would do the following:

<OL><P><LI>In your worksheet, select the range A1:D5.

<P><LI>On the Insert menu, point to Name, and then click Define.

<P><LI>In the Define Name dialog box, type "myrange" (without the quotation
   marks) in the Names In Worksheet box at the top of the dialog box. Make
   sure that the Refers To box at the bottom of this dialog box contains
   "=Sheet1!$A$1:$D$5" (without the quotation marks).

<P><LI>Click OK.

<P><LI>Modify the above recorded macro so it reads:
<P>
<PRE>      Sub Macro1()
         Range("myrange").Select
         ActiveSheet.PageSetup.PrintArea = Selection.Address
         ActiveWindow.SelectedSheets.PrintOut Copies:=1
      End Sub

   NOTE: Change only the first line of code. Instead of using a fixed range
   of cells, use the defined name "myrange".

</PRE></OL>If you now insert one or more rows within this range, the range of cells
referred to by the defined name "myrange" will grow accordingly, and if you
run your macro, all of the rows in this range will be printed.
