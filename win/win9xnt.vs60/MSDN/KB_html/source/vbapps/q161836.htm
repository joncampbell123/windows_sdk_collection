The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you create a macro with a Deactivate event that applies to a
worksheet, and you move the worksheet to another workbook, the Deactivate
event macro for the worksheet does not occur.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs because the Deactivate event does not occur for the
worksheet. The Deactivate event occurs when an object is no longer the
active window. When you move the worksheet to another workbook, the
worksheet is still the active worksheet. After you select another worksheet
in the workbook into which you moved the worksheet, the Deactivate event
occurs.
<P>
NOTE: When you move a worksheet to another workbook, the SheetDeactivate
event for the Workbook object also does not occur.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Instead of using either the Deactivate event for the worksheet or the
SheetDeactivate event for the workbook, use the WindowDeactivate event for
the workbook to trap the movement of the worksheet.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>

<P><LI>Start the Visual Basic Editor (press ALT+F11).

<P><LI>If the Project Explorer window is not displayed, click Project Explorer
    on the View menu.

</OL>This step displays the Code module that is associated with the
workbook.

<OL><P><LI>In the Object list, click Workbook.
<P>
</OL>This step displays a subprocedure for the Open event for the workbook.

<OL><P><LI>In the Procedure list, click WindowDeactivate.
<P>
</OL>This step displays a subprocedure for the WindowDeactivate event for
the workbook.

<OL><P><LI>Type the following code in this subprocedure:
<P>
       MsgBox "You deactivated the previous window."
<P>
    The procedure should appear as follows:
<P>
       Private Sub Workbook_WindowDeactivate(ByVal Wn As Excel.Window)
<P>
<PRE>           MsgBox "You deactivated the previous window."

       End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>On the File menu, click "Close and Return to Microsoft Excel."

<P><LI>Click New on the Standard toolbar to open another new workbook.
<P>
</OL>A message box appears with the following message:
<P>

</PRE><P><LI>Click OK to close the message box.
<P>
</OL>The workbook you opened is the active workbook.

<OL><P><LI>Switch to the other workbook (the workbook you opened in step 1).

<P><LI>Move Sheet1 from this workbook to the workbook you opened in step 9.
<P>
</OL>A message box appears with the following message:
<P>
<PRE>   You deactivated the previous window.
