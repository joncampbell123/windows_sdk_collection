<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Excel does not have a built-in function to count the number of
words in a cell. However, the following example demonstrates a method to
count the number of words in a cell that are separated by a specific
character.
<P>
If cell A1 contains the text string "The car drove fast," the following
formula will return a value of 4 to reflect that the string contains four
words separated by spaces:
<P>
<PRE>   =LEN(A1)-LEN(SUBSTITUTE(A1," ",""))+1

</PRE>The space between the first two double quotation marks represents the
character separating each word to be counted. If the items to be counted
are separated by commas, place a comma between the first two quotation
marks.
<P>
As a word counter, this will return an incorrect number if words are
separated by multiple spaces (for example, a double space following a
period). Based on the assumption that every word (and only a word) except
the last is separated by a space, the following formula will always return
an accurate number:
<P>
<PRE>   =LEN(TRIM(A1))-LEN(SUBSTITUTE(A1," ",""))+1

</PRE>You can also use this formula to count the total occurrences of a specific
character by removing the +1 at the end of the formula. To count the total
occurrences of a specific character, that character must be entered as the
second argument in the SUBSTITUTE function.
