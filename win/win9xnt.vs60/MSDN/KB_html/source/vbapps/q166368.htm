<P>
<PRE>   - Microsoft Outlook Standard No-Charge Support

     Microsoft provides unlimited no-charge support for usability
     questions related to Microsoft Outlook. If you have questions
     related to custom forms, VBScript or automation, support
     engineers can answer basic questions about how to get started
     creating custom forms and also discuss resources that are
     available for learning how to program Outlook.

   - Office Developer Support for Microsoft Outlook

     Microsoft provides each Microsoft Outlook product license with
     two no-charge Office Developer incidents (additional incidents
     can be purchased for $55.00). At the Office Developer level of
     support, support engineers will be able to assist with specific
     questions regarding customizing Outlook. Examples include
     VBScript syntax, specific questions regarding the Outlook object
     model, questions related to distributing a forms solution, and
     providing additional resources that would apply to a particular
     solution. Support engineers cannot provide consulting-level
     services, such as writing programming code specific to a custom
     solution or designing a part of a solution (although the engineer
     can suggest various approaches to achieve the desired end result).
