<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article discusses "built-in" or predefined bookmarks you can use to go
to a location in a document.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft provides programming examples for illustration only, without
warranty either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the
implied warranties of merchantability and/or fitness for a particular
purpose. This article assumes that you are familiar with the programming
language being demonstrated and the tools used to create and debug
procedures. Microsoft support engineers can help explain the functionality
of a particular procedure, but they will not modify these examples to
provide added functionality or construct procedures to meet your specific
needs. If you have limited programming experience, you may want to contact
the Microsoft fee-based consulting line at (800) 936-5200. For more
information about the support options available from Microsoft, please see
the following page on the World Wide Web:
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/support/supportnet/refguide/default.asp">http://www.microsoft.com/support/supportnet/refguide/default.asp</A></B>

</PRE>Word sets, and automatically updates, a number of reserved bookmarks. You
can use these predefined bookmarks just as you use the ones that you place
in documents, except that you do not have to set them and they are not
listed on the Go To tab in the Find And Replace dialog box (Edit menu).
<P>
NOTE: Predefined Bookmarks cannot be used while your insertion point
is within a header, footer, comment or footnote. If your macro attempts
to access a predefined bookmark while the insertion point is anywhere
other than the main body of a document, the following error message will
appear:
<P>
<PRE>   Run-time error '5941': The requested member of the collection
   does not exist.

</PRE>You can use predefined bookmarks with the Bookmarks property. The following
example sets the bookmark named "currpara" to the location marked by the
predefined bookmark named "\Para."
<P>
<PRE>   ActiveDocument.Bookmarks("\Para").Copy "currpara"

</PRE>The following example moves the insertion point to the end of the document
using the predefined bookmark "\EndOfDoc":
<P>
<PRE>   Selection.GoTo What:=wdGoToBookmark, Name:="\endofdoc"

</PRE>The following table describes the predefined bookmarks available in Word.
<P>
<PRE>  Bookmark         Description
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  \Sel            Current selection or the insertion point.

  \PrevSel1       Most recent selection where editing occurred; going to
                  this bookmark is equivalent to running the GoBack method
                  once.

  \PrevSel2       Second most recent selection where editing occurred;
                  going to this bookmark is equivalent to running the
                  GoBack method twice.

  \StartOfSel     Start of the current selection.

  \EndOfSel       End of the current selection.

  \Line           Current line or the first line of the current selection.
                  If the insertion point is at the end of a line that is
                  not the last line in the paragraph, the bookmark includes
                  the entire next line.

  \Char           Current character, which is the character following the
                  insertion point if there is no selection, or the first
                  character of the selection.

  \Para           Current paragraph, which is the paragraph that contains
                  the insertion point or, if more than one paragraph is
                  selected, the first paragraph of the selection. Note that
                  if the insertion point or selection is in the last
                  paragraph of the document, the "\Para" bookmark does not
                  include the paragraph mark.

  \Section        Current section, including the break at the end of the
                  section, if any. The current section contains the
                  insertion point or selection. If the selection contains
                  more than one section, the "\Section" bookmark is the
                  first section in the selection.

  \Doc            Entire contents of the active document, with the
                  exception of the final paragraph mark.

  \Page           Current page, including the break at the end of the page,
                  if any. The current page contains the insertion point. If
                  the current selection contains more than one page, the
                  "\Page" bookmark is the first page of the selection. Note
                  that if the insertion point or selection is in the last
                  page of the document, the "\Page" bookmark does not
                  include the final paragraph mark.

  \StartOfDoc     Beginning of the document.

  \EndOfDoc       End of the document.

  \Cell           Current cell in a table, which is the cell that contains
                  the insertion point. If one or more cells of a table are
                  included in the current selection, the "\Cell" bookmark
                  is the first cell in the selection.

  \Table          Current table, which is the table that contains the
                  insertion point or selection. If the selection includes
                  more than one table, the "\Table" bookmark is the entire
                  first table of the selection, even if the entire table is
                  not selected.

  \HeadingLevel   The heading that contains the insertion point or
                  selection, plus any subordinate headings and text. If the
                  current selection is body text, the "\HeadingLevel"
                  bookmark includes the preceding heading, plus any
                  headings and text subordinate to that heading.
