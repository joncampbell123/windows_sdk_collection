</PRE><h3>Converting WordPerfect Macros to Visual Basic for Applications</h3>
 
<P>
This white paper describes the methodology, approach, and requirements for
converting macros developed for various versions of WordPerfect to Visual
Basic for Applications in Microsoft Word 97. See the following Web site at:
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/worddev/">http://www.microsoft.com/WordDev/</A></B>

</PRE><h3>WordPerfect 5.1 Macro Text Extractor</h3>
 
<P>
WordPerfect 5.1 for MS-DOS uses a proprietary file format for storing
macros. This macro-to-text utility converts macros written for WordPerfect
5.1 to standard text for viewing and printing.
<P>
<PRE>   Web site at: <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/worddev/">http://www.microsoft.com/WordDev/</A></B>

</PRE>NOTE: The utility does not translate WordPerfect macro code to Visual Basic
for Applications.
<P>
<P><h3>Additional Word Solution Migration Papers</h3>
 
<P>
The following papers are also available for developers creating solutions
in Microsoft Word 97.
<P>
<PRE>   WordBasic Migration to Visual Basic for Applications:

   In Microsoft Word 97, WordBasic code is automatically migrated to
   Visual Basic. This white paper explains the conversion process, many of
   the known conversion issues, and solutions to resolve conversion
   issues.

   WordBasic to Visual Basic for Applications Conversion Table:

   Excerpted from the online Help file found in Office 97, this conversion
   table provides a quick reference guide for Microsoft Word developers to
   locate the Visual Basic for Applications equivalent of WordBasic
   commands.

   Microsoft Word Objects:

   This chapter from the Microsoft Office 97/Visual Basic Programmer's
   Guide talks about the objects available in Word 97. The Programmer's
   Guide is included with Microsoft Office 97, Developer Edition.

   Switching from WordBasic:

   This appendix from the Microsoft Office 97/Visual Basic Programmer's
   Guide talks about switching from WordBasic to Visual Basic for
   Applications. The Programmer's Guide is included with Microsoft Office
   97, Developer Edition.

   Updating String Functions in WLLs and DLLs for Word 97:

   Visual Basic requires external libraries to use BSTR values in string
   -related functions. If you've written 32-bit Word add-in libraries
   (WLLs) or dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) that you need to use or support
   in Word 97, you need to modify any string-related functions in your
   library and recompile it. This paper describes the steps for updating
   those functions in your source files to avoid errors when the functions
   are called from Visual Basic.

   Updated WbODBC.wll Available:

   If you've written Word 95 solutions that use the ODBC functions in
   WbODBC.wll (a Word add-in library available in the Microsoft Word
   Developer's Kit, 3rd edition), you'll need to install this updated
   version of the WLL to run your solution in Word 97. In addition to a
   new version of the WLL, this download also includes new versions of the
   sample ODBC macros template (WbODBC97.dot) and the corresponding test
   database (Test.mdb). The macros in WbODBC97.dot have been updated to
   use Visual Basic and demonstrate how to use the ODBC add-in functions
   successfully in Word 97. For complete information about this update,
   see the Readme.txt file included in this download.

   Download WbODBCwl.exe (83K; expands to 224K)
