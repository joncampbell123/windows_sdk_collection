<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multiuser skills.
<P>
In the Windows environment, various display resolutions may cause screens
to appear out of proportion. As a developer, you can obtain the width and
height of various elements of the window display by using the Windows
application programming interface (API) function GetSystemMetrics().
Incorporating this function into a Microsoft Access application gives you
more information for designing the user interface. This article describes
the GetSystemMetrics() API function and provides an example of calling the
function from Microsoft Access.
<P>
This article assumes that you are familiar with Visual Basic for
Applications and with creating Microsoft Access applications using the
programming tools provided with Microsoft Access. For more information
about Visual Basic for Applications, please refer to your version of the
"Building Applications with Microsoft Access" manual.
<P>
NOTE: Visual Basic for Applications is called Access Basic in Microsoft
Access versions 1.x and 2.0. For more information about Access Basic,
please refer to the "Introduction to Programming" manual in Microsoft
Access version 1.x or the "Building Applications" manual in Microsoft
Access version 2.0.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Windows GetSystemMetrics() API function retrieves information about
the system metrics (the width and height of various display elements of a
particular window). The GetSystemMetrics() function can also return flags
that indicate whether a mouse is present or if the meaning of the left and
right mouse buttons have been reversed. System metrics are dependent upon
the system display and may vary from display to display.
<P>
To use the GetSystemMetrics() functions, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Place one the following Declare statements in the Declarations section
   of a module, depending on which version of Microsoft Access you are
   using.
<P>
   In Microsoft Access 7.0 and 97:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Declare Function GetSystemMetrics&amp; Lib "User32" (ByVal nIndex&amp;)
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      NOTE: The above statement is case-sensitive.
</PRE><P>
   In Microsoft Access 1.x or 2.0:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Declare Function GetSystemMetrics% Lib "user" (ByVal nIndex%)
</PRE>
<P><LI>Depending on which window property you want to determine, you must
   define the correct constant to pass to the GetSystemMetrics()
   function. Below are sample declarations of the constants and their
   meaning. Constants by default are Private. If you want to place these
   constants in a global module and have them available for the entire
   application, then you would have to add Public at the beginning of the
   constant statement. (Public Const SM_CXSCREEN = 0). For a complete list
   of the constants available for Windows 95, please refer to the Win32
   Software Development Kit.
