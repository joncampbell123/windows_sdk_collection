<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The InStr() function provides a method to search for the first occurrence
of one string (substring) inside another string. However, there is no
intrinsic method to search for the last occurrence of a substring. This
article provides a sample function written in Basic.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
There are two main methods of searching for the last occurrence of a
substring:

<OL><P><LI>Searching from the right-hand end of the string and stopping when the
   first match is found.

<P><LI>Searching from the left-hand end of the string until no more matches are
   found, and remembering the location of the last match.
<P>
</OL>While the first method would seem the logical approach (and would be in a
language such a C that allowed direct pointer manipulation), the second
method is nearly always faster in Visual Basic using the InStr() function
to search forward through the string.
<P>
This is because InStr() is highly optimized and many orders of magnitude
faster than emulating the functionality via looping through the string
using the Mid$() function to extract each character.
<P>
The code example below demonstrates the second method.

NOTE: In versions of Basic that don't support the "_" line continuation
character, the split lines must be entered on a single line when typing the
code into the module.
<P>
<P><h3>Step-by-Step Example</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create a new project and add a module:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Function InStrR(ByVal sTarget As String, _
<PRE></PRE>                      ByVal sFind As String, _
                      ByVal iCompare As Long) As Long
      Dim P As Long, LastP As Long, Start As Long
        P = InStr(1, sTarget, sFind, iCompare)
        Do While P
          LastP = P
          P = InStr(LastP + 1, sTarget, sFind, iCompare)
        Loop
        InStrR = LastP
      End Function

</PRE><P><LI>In Visual Basic only, run the project and when the default Form1 is
   displayed, pause it.

<P><LI>To test this function, type the following line in the Debug/Immediate
   window, and then press the ENTER key:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ?InStrR("The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog", "the", 0)
</PRE><P>
   You should see 33 as the result.
<P>
   Values for iCompare can be:
<P>
<PRE>      0   Binary comparison
      1   Text comparison
      2   Database Comparison (Microsoft Access)
