<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run a Visual Basic for Applications macro in Microsoft Excel 97,
you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Compile error:
   ByRef argument type mismatch

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may occur if all of the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>Within your code, one macro is executing another macro.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -and-
</PRE>
<LI>The first macro is attempting to pass a value to the second macro. The
   value in question is an element of an array declared as type Variant.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -and-
</PRE>
<LI>The second macro is set up to accept a value from the first macro, but
   of a type other than Variant (Integer or Long, for example).
<P>
</UL><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft provides examples of Visual Basic for Applications procedures for
illustration only, without warranty either expressed or implied, including,
but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and/or fitness
for a particular purpose. The Visual Basic procedures in this article are
provided 'as is' and Microsoft does not guarantee that they can be used in
all situations. While Microsoft support engineers can help explain the
functionality of a particular macro, they will not modify these examples to
provide added functionality, nor will they help you construct macros to
meet your specific needs. If you have limited programming experience, you
may want to consult one of the Microsoft Solution Providers. Solution
Providers offer a wide range of fee-based services, including creating
custom macros. For more information about Microsoft Solution Providers,
call Microsoft Customer Information Service at (800) 426-9400.
<P>
The following workarounds assume that you have a Visual Basic module that
contains two macros:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub Macro1()
       Dim X As Variant
       X = ActiveWorkbook.Sheets("Sheet1").Range("A1:A5")
       Macro2 X(1, 1)          'X is an array of type Variant...
   End Sub

   Sub Macro2(Y As Integer)    '...but Macro2 expects an Integer.
       MsgBox Y
   End Sub

</PRE>When run, the first macro (Macro1) initializes an array named X, populates
the array, and then sends a value from the array to the second macro
(Macro2). Macro2 then displays the value in a message box. If you run
Macro1 without applying any of the following workarounds, you will receive
the error message shown above.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1</h3>
 
<P>
To prevent the problem from occurring, change how the second macro (Macro2)
accepts values. In this case, change the second macro to
<P>
<PRE>   Sub Macro2(Y As Variant)    'Y is now a Variant, not an Integer.
       MsgBox Y
   End Sub

</PRE>to eliminate the problem, since an element from an array of type Variant is
being sent to a variable of type Variant.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 2</h3>
 
<P>
A second way to prevent the problem from occurring is to convert the value
to an Integer as you pass it to the second macro using the CInt function.
<P>
<PRE>   Sub Macro1()
       Dim X As Variant
       X = ActiveWorkbook.Sheets("Sheet1").Range("A1:A5")
       Macro2 CInt(X(1, 1))  'Convert Variant X(1, 1) using CInt
   End Sub

   Sub Macro2(Y As Integer)  'Macro2 expects an Integer.
       MsgBox Y
   End Sub

</PRE><h3>Method 3</h3>
 
<P>
Another way to prevent the problem from occurring is to dimension a second
variable in the first macro. This second variable should be of the same
type as the value accepted by the second macro. The value from the array is
copied into the second variable, which is then sent to the second macro.
For example:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub Macro1()
       'Z is the second variable. It is an Integer, just like Y.
       Dim X As Variant, Z As Integer

       X = ActiveWorkbook.Sheets("Sheet1").Range("A1:A5")
       Z = X(1, 1) 'Get the value from the array and put it in Z.
       Macro2 Z    'This works correctly.
   End Sub

</PRE>Since Z is an integer, the value of Z is received by Macro2 (which expects
an integer) correctly.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design of Microsoft Excel 97. The behavior demonstrated
by earlier versions of Microsoft Excel is actually incorrect.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In earlier versions of Microsoft Excel, a value can be passed from an
element in an array of type Variant in one function, to a variable of
another type in another function. This is called "automatic type coercion",
since the value passed between functions is being forced (coerced) to
switch from one type (Variant) to another type (Integer, for example).
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 97, automatic type coercion is not supported. Because of
this, you may need to ensure that your macros consistently use the same
types of variables when passing values from macro to macro.
