The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, version 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, the screen does not appear to be updated as expected
when you are using the SQLRetrieve macro function to fetch data.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel version 5.0, the results are returned essentially by
pasting the data to the Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. However, in Microsoft
Excel version 5.0c, a faster method of returning data is used to populate
the spreadsheet with the data.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To avoid this problem, use the ScreenUpdating property of the Application
object. When this property is set to False, the screen is not updated until
the macro stops or the property is set back to True. The following macro
example illustrates this workaround:
<P>
<P>
<PRE>Sub SQLRetrieve_Example()
   ' Open a channel to the Nwind data source.
   chan = SQLOpen("DSN=Nwind 2.0")

   ' Execute a query to return all records from the Employee table.
   SQLExecQuery chan, "SELECT * FROM employee"

   ' Retrieves the first record to the buffer.
   SQLRetrieve chan, ActiveCell, 2, 1, False, False, True, True

   ' Turn off screen updating.
   Application.ScreenUpdating = False

   ' Loop through the current data set and return one row at a time.
   For x = 1 To 20
       SQLRetrieve chan, ActiveCell.Offset(x, 0), 2, 1, _
          False, False, True, False
   Next

   ' Close the channel to Nwind.
   SQLclose chan

   ' Turn on screen updating.
   Application.ScreenUpdating = True
End Sub
