</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Excel 97 includes a new Visual Basic for Applications property
called Value2. The Value2 property, which you can use for the Range object,
is almost identical to the Value property except that the Value2 property
does not use the Currency and Date data types. Depending on how a cell is
formatted (for example, with date, currency, or other formats), the two
properties may return different values for the same cell.
<P>
Note that the Value2 property is not available in earlier versions of
Microsoft Excel. Therefore, if a cell is formatted with a currency number
format or a date number format, the Value property may not return the
expected underlying cell value.
<P>

Microsoft provides examples of Visual Basic for Applications procedures for

but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and/or fitness
for a particular purpose. The Visual Basic procedures in this article are
provided 'as is' and Microsoft does not guarantee that they can be used in
all situations. While Microsoft support engineers can help explain the
functionality of a particular macro, they will not modify these examples to
provide added functionality, nor will they help you construct macros to
meet your specific needs. If you have limited programming experience, you
may want to consult one of the Microsoft Solution Providers. Solution
Providers offer a wide range of fee-based services, including creating
custom macros. For more information about Microsoft Solution Providers,

<P>
In the following example, the Value and Value2 properties return different
results for the same cell object. To see the results, use the following
steps:

<OL><P><LI>Close and save any open workbooks, and then create a new workbook.

<P><LI>Enter the following in Sheet1:
<P>
<P><PRE>      A1: 1.23456789
      A2: 2/3/97
</PRE>
<P><LI>Click cell A1 and click cells on the Format menu. Then, on the Number
   tab, click Currency in the Category list, and click OK.

<P><LI>Click cell A2 and click cells on the Format menu.

<P><LI>Click the Number tab, click Date in the Category list, and click
   OK.

<P><LI>Start the Visual Basic Editor (press ALT+F11).

<P><LI>On the Insert menu, click Module.

<P><LI>Enter the following code in the Visual Basic module:
<P>
<PRE>      Sub Value_vs_Value2()

         MsgBox "Currency returned by Value property = " &amp; _
            Sheet1.Range("A1").Value

         MsgBox "Currency returned by Value2 property = " &amp; _
            Sheet1.Range("A1").Value2

         MsgBox "Date returned by Value property = " &amp; _
            Sheet1.Range("A2").Value

         MsgBox "Date returned by Value2 property = " &amp; _
            Sheet1.Range("A2").Value2

      End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>Run the Value_vs_Value2 macro. To do this, click Macros on the Tools
   menu. Click Value_vs_Value2 and click Run.
<P>
</OL>The macro displays the following messages in order:
<P>
<PRE>   Currency returned by Value property =  1.2346

   Currency returned by Value2 property = 1.23456789

   Date returned by Value property = 2/3/97

   Date returned by Value2 property = 35431

</PRE></OL>The underlying cell value in cell A1 is 1.23456789, however, the Value
property returns 1.2346. This is true because Microsoft Excel stores
currency numbers in an integer format that is scaled by 10,000 to produce a
fixed-point number with 15 digits to the left of the decimal and 4 digits
to the right of the decimal. For cells formatted as currency, the Value2
property returns the actual underlying cell value.
<P>
The underlying cell value in cell A2 is the serial number for 2/3/97, which
is 35431. The Value property returns a date formatted with the short date
format. The Value2 property, for cells formatted as a date, returns the
underlying serial number for the date.

For more information about using the Value2 property, click the Office
Assistant, type "value2" (without the quotation marks), click Search, and
then click to view the "Value2 Property" topic.

Standard toolbar. If Visual Basic for Applications Help is not installed on
