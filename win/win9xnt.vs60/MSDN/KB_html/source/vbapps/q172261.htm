The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you quit Microsoft Excel 97, you may receive the following error
message:
<P>
<PRE>   Cannot quit Microsoft Excel.

</PRE>You are unable to quit Microsoft Excel 97.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs if you attempt to quit Microsoft Excel 97 after
performing either of the following actions:

<UL><LI>You press F8 when the pointer is not inside a subroutine or a function.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE>
<LI>You press F8 when the pointer is in an empty Visual Basic module.
<P>
</UL>NOTE: If you subsequently run a Visual Basic macro or subroutine, the
problem does not occur.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft provides examples of Visual Basic for Applications procedures for
illustration only, without warranty either expressed or implied, including,
but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and/or fitness
for a particular purpose. The Visual Basic procedures in this article are
provided 'as is' and Microsoft does not guarantee that they can be used in
all situations. While Microsoft support engineers can help explain the
functionality of a particular macro, they will not modify these examples to
provide added functionality, nor will they help you construct macros to
meet your specific needs. If you have limited programming experience, you
may want to consult one of the Microsoft Solution Providers. Solution
Providers offer a wide range of fee-based services, including creating
custom macros. For more information about Microsoft Solution Providers,
call Microsoft Customer Information Service at (800) 426-9400.
<P>
If this problem occurs, run a Visual Basic subroutine. To run a subroutine,
use either of the following methods:

<UL><LI>In a Visual Basic module, place the cursor inside an existing
   subroutine, or type a new subroutine. Then, press F5 twice to
   run the subroutine.
<P>
   NOTE: If you use a new subroutine, it is recommended that you use a
   subroutine similar to the following:
<P>
<PRE>      Sub Test()
          MsgBox "This is a test."
      End Sub

    -or-

</PRE><LI>In Microsoft Excel 97, point to Macro on the Tools menu and click
   Macros. Then, click the name of a macro and click Run. Press F5 again
   to run the subroutine.
<P>
</UL>After you run a subroutine, you can quit Microsoft Excel 97.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Normally, if you press F8 when the Visual Basic Editor is active, the
selected subroutine or function is run in "step into" mode. When you run a
macro in this mode, you can execute one line of code at a time by pressing
F8 repeatedly. You can exit step into mode by pressing F5. The Visual Basic
Editor also automatically exits Step Into mode when a macro is completed.
<P>
If you press F8 when the pointer is not inside a subroutine or function,
Microsoft Excel 97 enters step into mode; however, no macro is active. As a
result, even though no macro is running, Microsoft Excel 97 behaves as
through a macro is running. When this behavior occurs, you cannot quit
Microsoft Excel 97.
