<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how to configure a Visual Basic for Applications
project to use a specific Help file. The ActiveX and Forms controls in a
UserForm can use context-sensitive Help to display Help topics in the Help
file.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Assigning a Help File to a Project</h3>
 
<P>
Configuring a Visual Basic project to use a particular Help file allows you
to assign a Help topic identification number to a control on a UserForm.
When you select the control and press F1, the topic in the Help file
appears. To assign a Help file to a project, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>In the Visual Basic Editor (press ALT+F11), right-click any object in
   the project in the Project Explorer and click VBAProject Properties.

<P><LI>In the "VBAProject - Project Properties" dialog box, type the path and
   file name of the Help file in the Help File Name box or click the
   button to the right of the box to find the Help file. Click OK.
<P>
</OL><h3>Assigning a Help Topic to an Office Form Control</h3>
 
<P>
To assign a Help topic ID to an existing Office form control, follow these
steps:

<OL><P><LI>In the Visual Basic Editor (press ALT+F11), display the UserForm with
   the control, and then right-click the control and click Properties.

<P><LI>In the Properties window, set the HelpContextId property to the topic
   ID for the topic you want to appear when F1 is pressed.
<P>
<P>
</OL><h3>Assigning a Help File and Topic at Run Time</h3>

provide added functionality or construct procedures to meet your specific
needs. If you have limited programming experience, you may want to contact

<P>
<PRE>   <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/supportnet/refguide/">http://www.microsoft.com/supportnet/refguide/</A></B>

</PRE></OL>You can also assign the Help file and Help topic ID at run time by
specifying the HelpFile property for the project and the HelpContextId
property for the control. To assign a Help file and topic, follow these
steps:

<OL><P><LI>Display the Code window for the UserForm by right-clicking the UserForm
   and clicking View Code. Click UserForm in the Object list. Click
   Activate in the Procedure list and type the following code in a Sub
   procedure
<P>
<P><PRE>      Application.VBE.VBProjects&lt;project&gt;.HelpFile = &lt;help file&gt;
      &lt;object&gt;.HelpContextId = &lt;value&gt;
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;project&gt; is the name of the Visual Basic project.
<P>
   NOTE: You can use the ActiveProject property instead as in the following
   example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Application.VBE.ActiveProject.HelpFile = "C:\myHelp.hlp"
</PRE><P>
   Note that &lt;help file&gt; is the path and file name of the Help file and
   &lt;object&gt; is the object name of the ActiveX control on the UserForm. For
   example, if you are using the Toolbar control, the statement is similar
   to the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Toolbar1.HelpContextId = 1
</PRE><P>
   Also, &lt;value&gt; is the Help topic ID you want to appear when Help is
   displayed.
<P>
</OL><h3>Assigning a Help Topic to an ActiveX Control</h3>
 
<P>
To assign a Help topic ID to an ActiveX control, use the HelpCommand and
HelpContext properties. To assign a Help topic ID to an ActiveX control,
follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>In the Visual Basic Editor (press ALT+F11), display the UserForm with
   the ActiveX control, and then double-click the UserForm.

<P><LI>In the Code window for the UserForm, click UserForm in the Object list.
   Click Activate in the Procedure list. Type the following code
   in a Sub procedure
<P>
<P><PRE>      Application.VBE.VBProjects&lt;project&gt;.HelpCommand = cdlHelpContext
      &lt;control&gt;.HelpContext = &lt;value&gt;
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;project&gt; is the name of the Visual Basic project.
<P>
   NOTE: You can use the ActiveProject object instead as in the following
   example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Application.VBE.ActiveProject.HelpCommand = cdlHelpContext
</PRE><P>
   Note that &lt;control&gt; is the name of the ActiveX control. For example if
   you are using the Slider control, the statement is similar to the
   following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Slider1.HelpContext = 10
</PRE><P>
   Also, &lt;value&gt; is the Help topic ID you want to appear when Help is
   displayed.
<P>
