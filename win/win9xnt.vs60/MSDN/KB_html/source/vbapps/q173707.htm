<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Knowledge Base contains a number of articles that contain
sample code for Visual Basic for Applications macros. Many of these macros
illustrate basic concepts of programming in Visual Basic for Microsoft
Office. This article contains instructions on how to use the sample code to
create a new macro, and how to run that macro.
<P>

<PRE>   <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/supportnet/refguide/">http://www.microsoft.com/supportnet/refguide/</A></B>

</PRE>Microsoft Excel stores macros in workbooks; Microsoft PowerPoint stores
macros in presentations, and Microsoft Word stores macros in templates and
documents. To use the sample code in a Knowledge Base article, you must add
a new Visual Basic macro (or select an existing macro) in an Excel
workbook, PowerPoint presentation or Word template or document. You can
then paste or type the sample code into this macro. Use any of the
following methods.
<P>
<P><h3>To Create a New Macro</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Open or create an Excel workbook, PowerPoint presentation or Word
   template or document as appropriate.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, point to Macro, and then click Macros.

<P><LI>In the Macros In list, click the Excel workbook, PowerPoint presentation
   or Word template or document where you want to save the macro.

<P><LI>In the Macro Name box, type a name for the macro.

<P><LI>Click Create to open the Visual Basic Editor.

<P><LI>Type the macro code between the first line
<P>
<PRE>      Sub &lt;macro name&gt;()

   and the last line:

      End Sub

   To add the sample code to the macro using the Clipboard, follow these
   steps:

    a Switch to the program that you are using to view the Knowledge Base
      article, such as Microsoft Internet Explorer.

    b. Select only the sample code between the first line, "Sub &lt;macro
       name&gt;()" and the last line, "End Sub."

    c. On the Edit menu, click Copy.

    d. Switch to the Visual Basic Editor.

    e. In the Visual Basic Editor, click to place the insertion point
       between the first line, "Sub &lt;macro name&gt;()" and the last line, "End
       Sub" of your macro.

    f. On the Edit menu, click Paste.

</PRE></OL><h3>To Add the Sample Code to a Module</h3>
 
<P>
To add code to a module, you must either have an existing module or create
a new module. To do this, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Open or create an Excel workbook, PowerPoint presentation or Word
   template or document as appropriate.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, point to Macro and then click Visual Basic Editor.

<P><LI>In the Project window of the Visual Basic Editor (by default this is in
   the upper left corner), click the project icon with the same name as
   your workbook, presentation, template, or document. If you haven't yet
   saved your workbook, presentation, template or document, the project
   name is based on the program that you are using.
<P>
<PRE>      Program                Default project name
      -------------------------------------------

      Microsoft Excel        VBAProject(Book1)

      Microsoft PowerPoint   VBAProject(Presentation1)

      Microsoft Word         Project(Document1)
                             -or-
                             TemplateProject(Template1)

   NOTE: If you want to store your macro in the default Microsoft
   Word template, Normal.dot, double-click the Normal project.

</PRE><P><LI>If the project you clicked does not contain a folder called Modules
   underneath it, click Module on the Insert menu.

<P><LI>Click anywhere in the code window of the module you want to create. The
   code window is usually in the upper right corner of the Visual Basic
   Editor.

<P><LI>Type the sample code exactly as it appears in the Knowledge Base
   article, including the "Sub &lt;macro name&gt;()" and "End Sub" lines.
   Use the TAB key to indent text.
<P>
   NOTE: Lines that begin with an apostrophe (') are comments and are not
   required to run the macro. However, you may want to type them in to make
   it easier to understand the macro.
<P>
</OL><h3>To Run the Macro</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Switch from the Visual Basic Editor to Excel, PowerPoint or Word as
   appropriate.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, point to Macro and then click Macros.

<P><LI>Click the name of the macro on the Macro Name list and then click Run.

Microsoft Help for each Office program contains numerous topics about
working with macros. Visual Basic help contains extensive information about
writing your own code.
