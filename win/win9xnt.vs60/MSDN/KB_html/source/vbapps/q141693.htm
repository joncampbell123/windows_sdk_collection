The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications, versions 1.0, 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0c
<LI>Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, versions 5.0, 5.0a

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The scope of a variable is determined at the time the variable is declared.
In Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications, the three scopes available for 
variables are procedure, module, and public. The "More Information" section 
of this article describes each scope in detail.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Procedure (Local) Scope</h3>
 
<P>
A local variable with procedure scope is recognized only within the
procedure in which it is declared. A local variable can be declared with a
Dim or Static statement.
<P>
Dim:
<P>
When a local variable is declared with the Dim statement, the variable 
remains in existence only as long as the procedure in which it is declared 
is running. Usually, when the procedure is finished running, the values of 
the procedure's local variables are not preserved, and the memory allocated 
to those variables is released. The next time the procedure is executed, 
all of its local variables are reinitialized.
<P>
For example, in the following sample macros, "Example1" and "Example2," the 
variable X is declared in each of the modules. Each variable X is 
independent of the other--the variable is only recognized within its  
respective procedure.
<P>
<PRE>   Sub Example1()
      Dim X As Integer
      ' Local variable, not the same as X in Example2.
      X = 100
      MsgBox "The value of X is " &amp; X
   End Sub

   Sub Example2()
      Dim X As String
      ' Local variable, not the same as X in Example1.
      X = "Yes"
      MsgBox "The answer is " &amp; X
   End Sub

</PRE>Static:
<P>
A local variable declared with the Static statement remains in existence 
the entire time Visual Basic is running. The variable is reset when any of 
the following occur:

<UL><LI>The macro generates an untrapped run-time error.

<LI>Visual Basic is halted.

<LI>You quit Microsoft Excel.

<LI>You change the module.
<P>
</UL>For example, in the RunningTotal example, the Accumulate variable retains 
its value every time it is executed. The first time the module is run, if 
you enter the number 2, the message box will display the value "2." The 
next time the module is run, if the value 3 is entered, the message box 
will display the running total value to be 5.
<P>
<PRE>   Sub RunningTotal()
      Static Accumulate
      ' Local variable that will retain its value after the module
      ' has finished executing.
      num = Application.InputBox(prompt:="Enter a number: ", Type:=1)
      Accumulate = Accumulate + num
      MsgBox "The running total is " &amp; Accumulate
   End Sub

</PRE><h3>Module Scope</h3>
 
<P>
A variable that is recognized among all of the procedures on a module sheet
is called a "module-level" variable. A module-level variable is available
to all of the procedures in that module, but it is not available to
procedures in other modules. A module-level variable remains in existence
while Visual Basic is running until the module in which it is declared is
edited. Module-level variables can be declared with a Dim or Private
statement at the top of the module above the first procedure definition.
<P>
At the module level, there is no difference between Dim and Private. Note
that module-level variables cannot be declared within a procedure.
<P>
NOTE: If you use Private instead of Dim for module-level variables, your
code may be easier to read (that is, if you use Dim for local variables
only, and Private for module-level variables, the scope of a particular
variable will be more clear).
<P>
In the following example, two variables, A and B, are declared at the
module level. These two variables are available to any of the procedures on
the module sheet. The third variable, C, which is declared in the Example3
macro, is a local variable and is only available to that procedure.
<P>
Note that in Example4, when the macro tries to use the variable C, the
message box is empty. The message box is empty because C is a local
variable and is not available to Example4, whereas variables A and B are.
<P>
<PRE>   Dim A As Integer        ' Module-level variable.
   Private B As Integer    ' Module-level variable.

   Sub Example1()
       A = 100
       B = A + 1
   End Sub

   Sub Example2()
       MsgBox "The value of A is " &amp; A
       MsgBox "The value of B is " &amp; B
   End Sub

   Sub Example3()
        Dim C As Integer    ' Local variable.
        C = A + B
        MsgBox "The value of C is " &amp; C
   End Sub

   Sub Example4()
        MsgBox A
        ' The message box displays the value of A.
        MsgBox B
        ' The message box displays the value of B.
        MsgBox C
        ' The message box displays nothing because C was a local variable.
   End Sub

</PRE><h3>Public Scope</h3>
 
<P>
Public variables have the broadest scope of all variables. A public 
variable is recognized by every module in the active workbook. To make a 
public variable available to other workbooks, from a new workbook select 
the workbook containing the public variable in the Available References box 
of the References dialog box (from a module sheet, click References on the 
Tools menu).
<P>
A public variable, like a module-level variable, is declared at the top of
the module, above the first procedure definition. A public variable cannot
be declared within a procedure. A public variable is always declared with a
"Public" statement. A public variable may be declared in any module sheet.
<P>
It is possible for multiple module sheets to have public variables with the 
same name. To avoid confusion and possible errors, it is a good idea to use 
unique names or to precede each variable name with a module qualifier (for 
example, in a module named "Feb_Sales" you may want to precede all public 
variables with the letters "FS").
<P>
To create the macros:

<OL><P><LI>Create a new workbook and name it CDSales.xls.

<P><LI>In the CDSales.xls workbook, insert a module sheet. Name the module
   sheet CDSales.
<P>
   In Microsoft Excel 97 or Microsoft Excel 98 follow these steps to
   insert a new module sheet and name the module sheet:

</PRE><P>
<PRE>      Sub CDSales()
         Dim X as String
         SalesPrice = 12
         UnitsSold = 1000
         CostPerUnit = 5
         Markup = 1.05
         X = "yes"
         MsgBox "The Gross Profit for CD Sales is $" &amp; (SalesPrice _
            * UnitsSold) -(UnitsSold * CostPerUnit * Markup)
         ' Displays the value of 7000 as the gross profit.
      End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>Create a new workbook and name it VideoSales.xls.

<P><LI>In the VideoSales.xls workbook, insert a module sheet. Name the module
   sheet VideoSales.
<P>
   In Microsoft Excel 97 or Microsoft Excel 98 follow these steps to
   insert a new module sheet and name the module sheet:
<P>
   a. In the CDSales.xls workbook, point to Macro on the Tools menu, and
<P><PRE>      then click Visual Basic Editor.
</PRE><P>
   b. On the Insert menu, click Module.

      ENTER.
</PRE>
<P><LI>In the VideoSales module sheet, type the following code:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Public SalesPrice As Integer
      Public UnitsSold As Integer
      Public CostPerUnit As Integer
</PRE><P>
<PRE>      Sub VideoSales()
         SalesPrice = CDSales.SalesPrice * 1.05
         UnitsSold = CDSales.UnitsSold * 1.456
         CostPerUnit = CDSales.CostPerUnit * 1.75
         MsgBox "The Projected Gross Profit for video sales is $" &amp; _
            (SalesPrice * UnitsSold) - (UnitsSold * CostPerUnit)
         ' Displays the value of 5824 as the projected gross profit.
      End Sub

</PRE></OL>To Run the Sample Macros in Microsoft Excel 5.0, 7.0
