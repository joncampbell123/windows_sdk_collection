<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you run a UserForm, a close button is added to the upper-right corner
of the UserForm window. To prevent a user from closing the UserForm with
the Close button, use the QueryClose event of the UserForm.

</PRE>The QueryClose event of a UserForm occurs before the UserForm is closed.
You can use the CloseMode argument of the QueryClose event to determine
what method is used to close the UserForm. A value of vbFormControlMenu for
the CloseMode argument of the QueryClose event indicates that the UserForm
is being dismissed with the Close button. To prevent the UserForm from
closing, set the Cancel argument of the QueryClose event to any nonzero
value. For example, use the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Save and close any open workbooks, and then create a new workbook.

<P><LI>Start the Visual Basic Editor (press ALT+F11).

<P><LI>On the Insert menu, click UserForm.

<P><LI>Draw a CommandButton control on the UserForm.

<P><LI>Double-click the CommandButton to open the Code window for the UserForm.

<P><LI>In the module type the following code:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Private Sub CommandButton1_Click()
<PRE></PRE>         Unload Me
      End Sub

      Private Sub UserForm_QueryClose(Cancel As Integer, CloseMode As _
      Integer)
         If CloseMode = vbFormControlMenu Then Cancel = True
      End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>Run the UserForm.
<P>
</OL>When you click Close in the upper-right corner of the UserForm, the
UserForm is not dismissed. Clicking the command button also fires the
QueryClose event, but when you click the command button, the UserForm is
dismissed.
