The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0c
</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, the Visual Basic ChDir statement will fail if the path
argument does not contain a backslash character (\). This requirement may
cause problems if you use ChDir to change to a root directory, because the
path of a root directory does not necessarily contain a backslash.
<P>
NOTE: When you use Microsoft Excel version 7.0 or later, you won't get
an error message, but the directory won't change.
<P>
For example, the following Visual Basic code will fail
<P>
<PRE>   ChDir "C:"

</PRE>and you will receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Run-time error '76':
   Path not found

</PRE>The following lines of code will succeed, because they each contain a
backslash:
<P>
<PRE>   ChDir "C:\"

   -or-

   ChDir "C:\EXCEL\LIBRARY"

</PRE>It is possible to incorporate error-handling into a ChDir function to
prevent an error from occurring. The Visual Basic code example below
demonstrates one way to do this.
<P>
<P><h3>Visual Basic Code Example</h3>

Microsoft provides examples of Visual Basic for Applications procedures for

for a particular purpose. The Visual Basic procedures in this article are
provided 'as is' and Microsoft does not guarantee that they can be used in
all situations. While Microsoft support engineers can help explain the
functionality of a particular macro, they will not modify these examples to
provide added functionality, nor will they help you construct macros to
meet your specific needs. If you have limited programming experience, you
may want to consult one of the Microsoft Solution Providers. Solution
Providers offer a wide range of fee-based services, including creating
custom macros. For more information about Microsoft Solution Providers,

<P>
This Visual Basic code example displays an input box which asks you
which drive or directory you would like to switch to. When you
enter a drive or directory, the example checks whether the path you
enter contains a backslash and adds one, if needed, before switching
to that drive or directory.
<P>
To run the example, position the insertion point in the line that reads
"Sub MainMacro()" and press F5.
<P>
<PRE>'----------------------------------------------------------------------
</PRE>Option Explicit
<P>
<PRE>Sub MainMacro()
   'Dimension some variables.
   Dim NewDir As Variant
   'Prompts you to enter a drive/directory. For example, D: or C:\EXCEL.
   'If you type in an invalid directory, the subroutine will fail. For
   'example, typing just "C" (without the quotes) is not going to work.
   NewDir = InputBox("Switch to which drive/directory?")
   'If the NewDir ends in a colon, indicating it is a root directory,
   'concatenate a backslash onto the end of it. For example, C: would
   'become C:\. If you actually enter "C:\", the subroutine doesn't add
   'another backslash.
   If Right(NewDir, 1) = ":" Then
      NewDir = NewDir &amp; "\"
   End If
   'Switches to the proper drive (the first letter in NewDir: 'Left'
   'gives us this) and directory.
   ChDrive Left(NewDir, 1)             'change to the drive (C:, etc.)
   ChDir NewDir                        'change to the directory
   'Display the name of the current directory so you know it worked.
   MsgBox "Current directory is " &amp; CurDir()
End Sub
'----------------------------------------------------------------------

</PRE>The If-End If routine is the error-checking procedure. Whenever you use a
ChDir statement, preceding it with the If-End If routine (or some variation
of it) can help prevent the "no backslash" error.
