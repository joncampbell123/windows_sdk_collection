The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access versions 1.1, 2.0, 7.0, 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
When you open a form as a dialog form using the OpenForm method or macro
action, fields on the form do not display the values that you assign to
them.
<P>
This article assumes that you are familiar with Visual Basic for
Applications and with creating Microsoft Access applications using the
programming tools provided with Microsoft Access. For more information
about Visual Basic for Applications, please refer to your version of the
"Building Applications with Microsoft Access" manual.
<P>
NOTE: Visual Basic for Applications is called Access Basic in Microsoft
Access versions 1.x and 2.0. For more information about Access Basic,
please refer to the "Introduction to Programming" manual in Microsoft
Access version 1.x or the "Building Applications" manual in Microsoft
Access version 2.0.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This occurs because dialog forms are modal, and Microsoft Access suspends
code execution until the dialog form is closed; after the form is closed,
you cannot set values for any of its controls. Forms that are not opened
as dialog forms allow you to set values for their controls.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 
<P>
The following example uses the OpenForm method in a Visual Basic procedure.
The same results apply to using the OpenForm action in a macro.

<OL><P><LI>Open the sample database Northwind.mdb (or NWIND.MDB in versions 1.1
   and 2.0).

<P><LI>Create a new form called Form1. Add a text box control to the form and
   set its Name property (or ControlName property in version 1.1) to
   Field0.

<P><LI>Save and close the form.

<P><LI>Create a module and type the following line in the Declarations section
   if it is not already there:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Option Explicit
</PRE>
<P><LI>Type the following procedure:
<P>
   In Microsoft Access 7.0 and 97:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Function TestModal()
<PRE></PRE>         DoCmd.OpenForm "Form1", acNormal, "", "", acEdit, acDialog
         Forms!Form1!Field0 = "Hello"
      End Function

   In Microsoft Access 1.1 and 2.0:

      Function TestModal()
         DoCmd OpenForm "Form1", A_NORMAL, "", "", A_EDIT, A_DIALOG
         Forms!Form1!Field0 = "Hello"
      End Function

</PRE><P><LI>To test this function, type the following line in the Debug window (or
   the Immediate window in versions 1.1 and 2.0), and then press ENTER:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ?TestModal()
</PRE><P>
   Note that when the form opens, the text box does not display any text.
   Also, when you close the form you receive an error because the procedure
   continues to run, and the Field0 text box is no longer available to have
   its value set.
<P>
   If you change acDialog (or A_DIALOG in versions 1.1 and 2.0) to acNormal
   (or A_NORMAL in versions 1.1 and 2.0) in step 5, and then run the
   procedure again, the text box displays the word "Hello."
