<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multiuser skills.
<P>
This article demonstrates how to limit the amount of text typed into a text
box so that the width of the text does not exceed the width of the text
box.
<P>
This article assumes that you are familiar with Visual Basic for
Applications and with creating Microsoft Access applications using the
programming tools provided with Microsoft Access. For more information
about Visual Basic for Applications, please refer to your version of the
"Building Applications with Microsoft Access" manual.
<P>
NOTE: Visual Basic for Applications is called Access Basic in Microsoft
Access version 2.0. For more information about Access Basic, please refer
to the "Building Applications" manual.
<P>
NOTE: This article explains a technique demonstrated in the sample
files, FrmSampl.exe (for Microsoft Access for Windows 95 version 7.0)
and FrmSmp97.exe (for Microsoft Access 97). For information about how
to obtain these sample files, please see the following articles in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../access/q175066.htm">Q175066</A></B>
   TITLE     : ACC97: Microsoft Access 97 Sample Forms Available on MSL

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following information includes a Visual Basic for Applications
procedure, LimitTextToControlWidth, that can be called from the KeyPress
event of a text box to limit the amount of text entered so that the sum of
the width of all characters in the text does not exceed the width of the
text box.
<P>
This procedure is ideal for developers who want to use a non-
proportionally spaced font to print text into a fixed location on a pre-
printed form. The LimitTextToControlWidth procedure ensures that a user
will not be able to type more text than can fit in the defined area on the
form.
<P>
There are a number of factors that affect the width of text. The larger
the font size, the fewer the characters that you will be able to type. The
selection of font also affects the width of characters in the text.
Characters in a non-proportionally spaced font, such as Arial or Times
New Roman, have different widths. The letter "i" is narrower in width
than the letter "X." In addition, for the same font size, the letter
"i" in one font may have a different width in another font. The "i" in
Arial font is much narrower than the "i" in Courier New font.
<P>
The following steps provide both 16-bit and 32-bit versions of the
procedure, followed by an example of how to apply the procedure to
controls on a form.
<P>
NOTE: The following code uses the GetTextExtentPoint Windows application
programming interface (API) function. This API function can only be called
from the control that has focus on a Microsoft Access form.
