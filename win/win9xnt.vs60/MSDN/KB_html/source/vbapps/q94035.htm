The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access versions 1.0, 1.1, 2.0, 7.0, 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
In a multiuser environment, you cannot use the OpenDatabase method to find
out if the current database was opened exclusively. If you attempt to open
the current database with the OpenDatabase method in Visual Basic for
Applications, and the current database was originally opened exclusively,
the database opens and no error is returned.
<P>
This article assumes that you are familiar with Visual Basic for
Applications and with creating Microsoft Access applications using the
programming tools provided with Microsoft Access. For more information
about Visual Basic for Applications, please refer to your version of the
"Building Applications with Microsoft Access" manual.
<P>
NOTE: Visual Basic for Applications is called Access Basic in Microsoft
Access versions 1.x and 2.0. For more information about Access Basic,
please refer to the "Introduction to Programming" manual in Microsoft
Access version 1.x or the "Building Applications" manual in Microsoft
Access version 2.0.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Access ignores the option flags for all opens except the first
for a given window's task, so a system administrator cannot use this to
test whether a database has been opened exclusively. The technique does
not work because Microsoft Access does not check the option flags.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Currently there is no work around in Microsoft Access version 7.0 or
earlier.
<P>
In Microsoft Access 97, you receive a trappable error:
<P>
<PRE>   Run-time error 3045:
   Couldn't use '&lt;filename&gt;'; file already in use.

</PRE>However, if you run any Visual Basic procedure that uses the CurrentDB()
function or the DBEngine object before you execute the OpenDatabase
method, the error does not appear.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 
<P>
The following Visual Basic procedure successfully opens the current
database, even if the current database has been opened exclusively.

<OL><P><LI>Start Microsoft Access and click Open Database on the File menu.

<P><LI>Open the sample database Northwind.mdb (or NWIND.MDB in versions 1.x
   and 2.0). Click the Exclusive option in the Open dialog box (or Open
   Database dialog box in versions 1.x and 2.0).

<P><LI>Create a module and type the following line in the Declarations
   section:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Option Explicit
</PRE>
<P><LI>Type the following procedure:
<P>
   NOTE: In the following example, type the full path to the Northwind
   sample database in the OpenDatabase method. For example,
   "C:\Access\Sampapps\Nwind.mdb" or
   "C:\Msoffice\Access\Samples\Northwind.mdb."
<P>
<PRE>      Sub TestOpenDB()
         Dim db As Database
         Set db = OpenDatabase("Northwind.mdb", False)
         db.Close
      End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>To test this function, type the following line in the Debug window,
   and then press ENTER.
<P>
<P><PRE>      TestOpenDB
</PRE><P>
   Note that you do not receive an error message that the database is
   already opened exclusively.
