<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In a Microsoft Visual Basic Programming System, Applications Edition macro,
when you use the Format function to apply specific formatting to an
expression, and you call this function repeatedly in the macro, the
performance of the macro is slow relative to a macro that uses another
function to perform the same action.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
You can decrease the amount of time required for a macro using the Format
function in a repetitive loop to run by using the Str function. It may be
beneficial to test each of the statements before deciding which function
will work faster in your macro. The following examples use the Now function
to compare the speed of using the Format function versus the Str function
to format a value.
<P>
Note that the Format function is more convenient for formatting a value
than the Str function. However, if you are using the Format function in a
loop, where the function is called repeatedly more than 100 times, the
macro may run faster when you use the Str function than when you use the
Format function.

<PRE>   Sub Test_Str_Function()
      Const Mult = 100000
      Dim i as Integer
      Dim sVar As String
      ' Dimension variable dTimer as Double data type
      Dim dTimer As Double
      ' Set value of dTimer to current computer time
      dTimer = Now
      ' Repeat formatting commands 3000 times
      For i = 1 To 3000
         ' Set value of sVar to 30
         ' Use Mid function to strip leading space added by Str
         ' (space is added for the sign of the value)
         sVar = Mid(Str(30), 2)
         ' Pad result with leading 0's
         sVar = String(4 - Len(sVar), "0") &amp; sVar
      Next
      ' Set value of dTimer to difference between start and end
      dTimer = Now - dTimer
      ' Display amount of time in seconds it took to process loop
      MsgBox Format(dTimer * Mult, "0.00000000")
   End Sub

</PRE><h3>Testing Performance of Format Function</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   Sub Test_Format_Function()
      Const Mult = 100000
      Dim i as Integer
      Dim sVar As String
      ' Dimension variable dTimer as Double data type
      Dim dTimer As Double
      dTimer = Now
      ' Repeat formatting commands 3000 times
      For i = 1 To 3000
         ' Format value 30 as 0030
         sVar = Format(30, "0000")

      dTimer = Now - dTimer
      ' Display amount of time in seconds it took to process loop
      MsgBox Format(dTimer * Mult, "0.00000000")
   End Sub

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
You can use the Format function in a Visual Basic module to format an
expression according to instructions contained in a format expression. For
example, you can format the number 100 as $100.00 using the following
Format function:
<P>
<PRE>   MyNum = Format(100,"$##.00")

</PRE>If you use the Format function without specifying a format, the Format
function provides the same functionality as the Str function. However, when
you use the Format function to format a positive number as a string, there
is no leading space reserved for the sign of the value; when you use the
Str function, a positive number that is formatted as a string value has a
leading space reserved for the sign of the value.
