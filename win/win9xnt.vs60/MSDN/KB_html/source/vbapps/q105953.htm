<LI>Microsoft Query for Windows 95, version 2.0
<LI>Microsoft Query 97 for Windows

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
To automate the querying process between Microsoft Query and another
program, you can create a macro that logs into a data source from within
Microsoft Query. To do this, the macro must have the correct connection
string. You can obtain this connection string from an existing query
through a dynamic data exchange (DDE) channel to the query.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To obtain the connection string required by the Microsoft Query, call
ODBCLOGON by initiating a DDE session to a query that is currently
logged into a data source and perform a DDE request of the
connectionstring item:

<OL><P><LI>Start Microsoft Query and log on to a data source.

<P><LI>In Microsoft Query, create a query (QUERY1).

<P><LI>Start Microsoft Excel and create one of the following macros.
<P>
</OL><h3>Visual Basic Code Example</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft provides examples of Visual Basic for Applications procedures for
illustration only, without warranty either expressed or implied, including,
but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and/or fitness
for a particular purpose. The Visual Basic procedures in this article are
provided 'as is' and Microsoft does not guarantee that they can be used in
all situations. While Microsoft support engineers can help explain the
functionality of a particular macro, they will not modify these examples to
provide added functionality, nor will they help you construct macros to
meet your specific needs. If you have limited programming experience, you
may want to consult one of the Microsoft Solution Providers. Solution
Providers offer a wide range of fee-based services, including creating
custom macros. For more information about Microsoft Solution Providers,

<P>
<PRE>   Sub get_connection()

      ' Open a DDE channel to MSQuery and return the channel number
      chan = Application.DDEInitiate("Msquery", "Query1")
      ' Return the array that contains the connection string
      connect = Application.DDERequest(chan, "ConnectionString")
      ' Terminate the DDE channel
      Application.DDETerminate chan

   End Sub

</PRE></OL>The DDERequest method returns the array "connect" that contains a
valid connection string that can be used by the ODBCLOGON command in
order to connect through a DDE control.
<P>
NOTE: If you are using Microsoft Query 97, you must modify the line that
initiates the DDE channel. This line must include the correct name for the
query. In Microsoft Query 97, the query name is similar to "Query 1 from
&lt;Data Source Name&gt;." For example, if the data source that the query uses is
named "My DataSource," change the DDEInitiate line to the following:
<P>
<PRE>   chan = Application.DDEInitiate("Msquery", "Query 1 from My DataSource")

</PRE><h3>Microsoft Excel Version 4.0 Macro Example</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft provides macro examples for illustration only, without warranty
either expressed or implied, including but not limited to the implied
warranties of merchantability and/or fitness for a particular purpose.
This macro is provided as is and Microsoft in no way guaranties that the
following code can be used in all situations and will not support
modifications of the code to suit specific customer requirements.
<P>
<PRE>   =SET.NAME("CHAN",INITIATE("MSQUERY","QUERY1"))
   =SET.NAME("Connect",REQUEST(CHAN,"CONNECTIONSTRING"))
   =TERMINATE(CHAN)
   =RETURN()

</PRE>The defined name CONNECT will contain a valid connection string that
can be used by the ODBCLOGON command in order to connect through a DDE
control.
<P>
NOTE: If you are using Microsoft Query 97, you must modify the line that
initiates the DDE channel. This line must include the correct name for the
query. In Microsoft Query 97, the query name is similar to "Query 1 from
&lt;Data Source Name&gt;." For example, if the data source that the query uses
is named "My DataSource," change the DDEInitiate line to the following:
<P>
<PRE>    =SET.NAME("CHAN",INITIATE("MSQUERY","Query 1 from My DataSource"))
