<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Visual Basic, Applications Edition, when you use the
BuiltinDocumentProperties or CustomDocumentProperties property to set a
date prior to January 1, 1980, or after December 31, 1999, and if you use
two digits for the year (that is, you use the "mm/dd/yy" format), an
incorrect date value may result. For example, when you run the following
procedure
<P>
<PRE>   Sub Test()
      ThisWorkbook.BuiltinDocumentProperties("Last Save Time") = "1/1/04"
      MsgBox ThisWorkbook.BuiltinDocumentProperties("Last Save Time").Value
   End Sub

</PRE>a message box displays the value "11/30/79" instead of "1/1/04."
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The mm/dd/yy date sequence is a carry-over from the original 8-bit number
storage design of the hardware and software from the first PC design. In
the original design, the default first date was 01/01/80 and no allowance
was made for dates beyond 12/31/99. Software programs that use the standard
system settings for speed still refer to these stored values. Any value
outside the old range is not recognized as valid by the system. As a
result, you may receive incorrect answers or general protection (GP)
faults.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
If a date is outside the old default range of 01/01/80 to 12/31/99,
you must add the century to the date: that is, use the form "mm/dd/yyyy".
<P>
Microsoft provides examples of Visual Basic procedures for illustration
only, without warranty either expressed or implied, including but not
limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and/or fitness for a
particular purpose. This Visual Basic procedure is provided 'as is' and
Microsoft does not guarantee that it can be used in all situations.
Microsoft does not support modifications of this procedure to suit customer
requirements for a particular purpose.
<P>
For example, when you use the following lines in your procedure
<P>
<PRE>   var1 = "12/31/1979"
   ThisWorkbook.BuiltinDocumentProperties("Last Save Time") = "1/1/2004"

</PRE>a fully qualified date will be evaluated (this date it is expressed without
system interpolation).
<P>
NOTE: The syntax forms mm/dd/yy and mm/dd/yyyy refer to the actual cell or
variable contents; they do not refer to formatting applied to cells on a
worksheet.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
