The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, versions 7.0 and 7.0a
<LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run a Microsoft Excel Visual Basic for Applications macro that
uses Data Access Objects (DAO), you may receive one of the following error
messages:
<P>
<PRE>   Compile Error:
   Named Argument Not Found

   -or-

   Run-time error '438':
   Object doesn't support this property or method

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
DAO versions 3.0 and 3.5, which are included with Microsoft Excel 7.0 and
97 respectively, do not fully support named arguments. In some cases, named
arguments will work without error, however, you should avoid using them.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this behavior, use positional arguments instead of named
arguments.
<P>
Microsoft provides examples of Visual Basic for Applications procedures for

provided 'as is' and Microsoft does not guarantee that they can be used in
all situations. While Microsoft support engineers can help explain the
functionality of a particular macro, they will not modify these examples to
provide added functionality, nor will they help you construct macros to
meet your specific needs. If you have limited programming experience, you
may want to consult one of the Microsoft Solution Providers. Solution
Providers offer a wide range of fee-based services, including creating
custom macros. For more information about Microsoft Solution Providers,

<P>
In a Visual Basic macro, when you call a Subroutine or Function, you can
supply arguments positionally, in the order in which they appear in the
definition of the procedure. Alternatively, you can supply the arguments by
name without regard to position. However, with DAO properties and methods,
Microsoft recommends that you use only positional arguments.
<P>
<P><h3>Example of the Problem</h3>
 
<P>
The DAO 3.5 OpenDatabase method uses the following syntax:
<P>
<PRE>   Set &lt;database&gt; = OpenDatabase(dbname, options, readonly, connect)

</PRE>If you use the OpenDatabase method by supplying named arguments in the
macro, you may receive one of the errors described in this article. For
example, when you run the following macro, the compile error "Named
Argument Not Found" appears:
<P>
<PRE>   Set DB = _
      OpenDatabase(dbname:= "C:\My Documents\DB1.MDB", readonly: = True)

</PRE><h3>Example of the Resolution</h3>
 
<P>
To correct the problem, use positional arguments. To do this, supply the
arguments for the method in the correct position, where each argument is
delimited by a comma, as shown in the following example:
<P>
<PRE>   Set DB = OpenDatabase("C:\My Documents\DB1.MDB", , True)

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design in Microsoft Excel 97.

Visual Basic for Applications Help, type the following text
<P>

Arguments and Optional Arguments" topic.
