<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you open a workbook in Microsoft Excel, the Update Remote References
calculation setting for the workbook is usually selected. The exception to
this rule occurs when a workbook has been linked to an external data source
and you do not allow Microsoft Excel to update links to the external data
source.
<P>

</PRE>The Update Remote References calculation setting determines whether or not 
Microsoft Excel updates formulas that include references to external data 
sources (such as Microsoft Word for Windows documents or Microsoft Access 
databases). Note that Microsoft Excel workbooks and documents are NOT 
external data sources.
<P>
When you open a workbook, the Update Remote References setting will be set
according to the following table:
<P>
<PRE>                                           Update Remote
   Condition                               References Check Box
   ------------------------------------------------------------

   Workbook not linked to any other        Selected
   documents

   Workbook linked to other workbooks      Selected
   or Microsoft Excel documents

   Workbook linked to external data        Cleared (not selected)
   source and you select No when you
   receive the prompt "This document
   contains links. Re-establish links?"

   Workbook linked to external data        Selected
   source and you select Yes when you
   receive the prompt "This document
   contains links. Re-establish links?"

</PRE>To clear the Update Remote References setting in the active workbook:

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Options or Preferences.

<P><LI>Select the Calculation tab.

<P><LI>Clear the Update Remote References check box.

<P><LI>Click OK to accept the change.
<P>
</OL><h3>Sample Visual Basic Procedure</h3>
 
<P>
The following Visual Basic code example assumes that you have a file called
TEST.XLS, which is located in the C:\EXCEL directory. The example opens the
TEST.XLS file and then clears (turns off) the Update Remote References
check box. As the Sub procedure opens the file, it also prevents Microsoft
Excel from updating any of the workbook's external or remote references.
<P>
<PRE>   Sub Example()
       ' The zero after updateLinks indicates that neither external nor
       ' remote references should be updated when the file is opened.
       Workbooks.Open fileName:="C:\EXCEL\TEST.XLS", updateLinks:=0
       ' Turn off the Update Remote References setting for the workbook.
       ActiveWorkbook.UpdateRemoteReferences = False
   End Sub

</PRE></OL>Note that the Update Remote References check box is not a universal
setting: if two workbooks are open, one workbook can have its Update Remote
References setting selected, while in the other workbook the check box is
cleared. However, when you open a workbook, its Update Remote References
check box will be selected, no matter how it was saved, unless it contains
links to an external data source.
