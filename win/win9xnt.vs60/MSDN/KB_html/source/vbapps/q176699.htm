The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, versions 5.0, 5.0a
<LI>Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In the versions of Microsoft Excel listed at the beginning of this article,
if you run a Microsoft Excel macro or a Visual Basic for Applications
macro, you may receive an error message similar to either of the following:
<P>
<PRE>   Run-time error '1004':
   Cannot access 'C'.

    -or-

   Run-time error '1004':
   Microsoft Excel cannot access the file 'C'. There are several possible
   reasons:

   - The file name or path name does not exist.

   - The file you're trying to open is being used by another program.
     Close the document in the other program, and try again.

   - The name of the workbook you're trying to save is the same as the
     name of another document that is read-only. Try saving the workbook
     with a different name.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may occur if the macro contains code that saves a workbook by
using an MS-DOS path and file name, as in the following examples:
<P>
<PRE>   =SAVE.AS("C:\Data\Test.xls")

   ActiveWorkbook.SaveAs "C:\Data\Test.xls"

</PRE><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>

<P>
<PRE>   <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/supportnet/refguide/">http://www.microsoft.com/supportnet/refguide/</A></B>

</PRE>To work around this problem, make sure that your macro is designed to
account for differences between the Microsoft Windows and Macintosh
operating systems.
<P>
One way to do this is to use the Application.OperatingSystem property to
determine whether you are on a computer running Windows or on a computer
running the Macintosh operating system, for example:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub CheckOS()

       ' OS equals "Mac" if this is a Macintosh, "Win" if this is a
       ' computer running Windows or Windows NT.
       OS = Left(Application.OperatingSystem, 3)

       If OS = "Win" Then

           ' Use a valid Windows path.
           ActiveWorkbook.SaveAs "C:\Data\Test.xls"

       ElseIf OS = "Mac" Then

           ' Use a valid Macintosh path.
           ActiveWorkbook.SaveAs "Data:Test.xls"

       End If

   End Sub

</PRE>If you are using the Microsoft Excel (XLM) macro language, the code to use
is the following:
<P>
<PRE>   OS=LEFT(GET.WORKSPACE(1),3)
   =IF(OS="Win")
   =SAVE.AS("C:\Data\Test.xls")
   =ELSE.IF(OS="Mac")
   =SAVE.AS("Data:Test.xls")
   =END.IF()
   =RETURN()

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design of the versions of Microsoft Excel listed at the
beginning of this article.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Windows NT, path names for files include
both colons (:) and backslashes (\), for example:
<P>
<PRE>   C:\Data\Test.xls

</PRE>The colon separates the disk drive letter from the remainder of the path,
which uses backslashes to separate folder names from the file name.
<P>
On the Macintosh, path names for files use only colons, for example:
<P>
<PRE>   Data:Test.xls

</PRE>If you attempt to use a MS-DOS file name in a macro on the Macintosh, you
may receive an error message similar to one of those in the "Symptoms"
section in this article. This behavior occurs because the folder name "C"
(from "C:\Data\Test.xls") usually does not exist on a hard disk on a
Macintosh computer.
