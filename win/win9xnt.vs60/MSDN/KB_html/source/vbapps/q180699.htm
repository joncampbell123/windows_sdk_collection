The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you open a workbook, a macro that is designed to run when you
deactivate the active worksheet does not run.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>An OnSheetDeactivate macro is assigned to the active worksheet
   or workbook, or a macro is attached to the Deactivate event of
   the active worksheet.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -and-
</PRE>
<LI>You open a Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) document in Microsoft Excel.
<P>
</UL>When you open an HTML document, OnSheetDeactivate and Deactivate macros
that are assigned to the active worksheet do not run. However, after you
open the HTML document, the OnSheetDeactivate and Deactivate macros work
correctly.
<P>
NOTE: This problem does not occur when a macro is attached to the
Deactivate event of the active workbook.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click the worksheet that was active when you opened the .htm
   document.

<P><LI>Switch to the HTML document.
<P>
   The OnSheetDeactivate or Deactivate macro runs correctly.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>

</PRE></OL>To create an OnSheetDeactivate macro in Microsoft Excel, follow these
steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, point to Macro, and then click Visual Basic Editor.

<P><LI>On the Insert menu, click Module.

<P><LI>Type the following code into the new module:
<P>
<PRE>      Sub Trigger()
         Sheets("Sheet1").OnSheetDeactivate = "RunMe"
      End Sub

      Sub RunMe()
         MsgBox "You deactivated Sheet1."
      End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>Run the Trigger macro.
<P>
</OL>When you deactivate Sheet1, the macro specified in the OnSheetDeactivate
command ("RunMe") is run. You can specify any worksheet or workbook when
you use OnSheetDeactivate; if you specify a workbook, the macro is run when
you deactivate any sheet in the workbook.
<P>
You can also use the Deactivate event of a worksheet to run a macro. To do
this, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, point to Macro, and then click Visual Basic Editor.

<P><LI>In the Project window, double-click the sheet for which you want to
   add a macro.

<P><LI>In the Object list, click Worksheet. In the Procedure list, click
   Deactivate.

<P><LI>Change the code in the Code window to the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Private Sub Worksheet_Deactivate()
<PRE></PRE>         MsgBox "You deactivated Sheet1."
      End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>On the File menu, click "Close and Return to Microsoft Excel."
<P>
</OL>When you deactivate Sheet1, the Worksheet_Deactivate macro runs
automatically. It is not necessary to use a second macro to set the
Worksheet_Deactivate macro to run.
<P>
<P><h3>Example</h3>
 
<P>
To see an example of this problem, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Create a new workbook, and repeat steps 1 through 5 above.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Open. Select an HTML document, and then click
   Open.
<P>
   The macro does not run.

<P><LI>Switch to the workbook and click Sheet1. Then, switch to the .htm
   document.
<P>
   The macro runs as expected.
<P></OL>
