The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 97, if you run a Visual Basic for Applications macro
that uses the PasteSpecial method, you may find that the wrong worksheet
becomes activated. This may cause problems if your macro assumes that a
particular sheet is still active.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This occurs because, in Microsoft Excel 97, the PasteSpecial method
activates the sheet into which you are pasting information (the "target
sheet"). In earlier versions of Microsoft Excel, the PasteSpecial method
does NOT activate the target sheet.
<P>
Note that this problem occurs only when information is pasted into a sheet
other than that from which it was copied.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
If you need your Visual Basic macro to copy information from one sheet,
PasteSpecial the information into another sheet, and keep the original
sheet active, you will need to add two lines of code to the macro. These
lines of code keep track of the original sheet and reactivate it after the
PasteSpecial method is complete.
<P>
For example, if your original macro looks like this:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub CopyAndPasteSpecial1()
       Sheets("Sheet1").Range("A1:B5").Copy
       Sheets("Sheet2").Range("A1").PasteSpecial xlValues
   End Sub

</PRE>You will need to add two lines to the macro:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub CopyAndPasteSpecial2()

       'This new line remembers the name of the original sheet.
       Set xOriginalSheet = ActiveSheet

       Sheets("Sheet1").Range("A1:B5").Copy
       Sheets("Sheet2").Range("A1").PasteSpecial xlValues

       'This new line activates the original sheet.
       xOriginalSheet.Activate

   End Sub

</PRE>The modified code will work in all versions of Microsoft Excel, including
Microsoft Excel 97.

<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design of Microsoft Excel 97.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, you can use the PasteSpecial method in a Visual Basic
macro when you want to paste copied information in a certain way. For
example, if you copy a range of cells that contains formulas, and then you
want to paste just the results of the formulas, you could use a line of
code similar to the following:
<P>
<PRE>   Range("A1").PasteSpecial xlValues

</PRE>You can even paste information into a different sheet or into a sheet in
another workbook, by adding a reference to the sheet and/or workbook to the
line of code. For example:
<P>
<PRE>   Workbooks("Book2").Sheets("Sheet3").Range("A1").PasteSpecial xlValues

</PRE>If you do this in Microsoft Excel 97, the target sheet (in this case,
[Book2]Sheet3) will be activated. This may cause problems if your macro
assumes that the original sheet is still active.
<P>
If this change in behavior causes problems, use the information in the
Workaround section to force your macro to reactivate the original sheet.
