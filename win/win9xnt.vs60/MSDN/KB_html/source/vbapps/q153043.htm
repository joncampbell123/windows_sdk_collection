<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0c
<LI>Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, versions 5.0, 5.0a

</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When Microsoft Excel is being used as an OLE Server during an OLE
Automation session, the ScreenUpdating property and the DisplayAlerts
property are always set to TRUE. Attempts by the controller application to
reset either of these properties to FALSE through code in the controller
application ("in-process"), will be ignored.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This happens because, during OLE Automation, each line of code that is sent
to Microsoft Excel to be run from an OLE controller is being treated as a
separate Microsoft Excel macro. The screen updating or alerts would only be
turned off for that one line of code and be turned back on for the next
line of code that is sent to Microsoft Excel to be run. Therefore, using
the DisplayAlerts property or the ScreenUpdating property in this case is
not effective.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>

</PRE>In order to effectively disable screen updating or displaying alerts in
Microsoft Excel while Microsoft Excel is an OLE server in an OLE Automation
session, you must either make sure that the calls are made from Microsoft
Excel by running a Microsoft Excel macro to perform the tasks or write the
code in such a way as to prevent the occurrence in the first place.
<P>
Workaround 1: Running a Microsoft Excel Macro from an OLE Controller
 
<P>
You could use the Run method from the OLE controller to tell Microsoft
Excel to run a macro that exists in Microsoft Excel. From this macro you
can effectively include DisplayAlerts or ScreenUpdating before the commands
in question.
<P>
If Microsoft Visual Basic version 4.0 is being used as the OLE controller
application, you could alternatively place the Visual Basic code that
controls Microsoft Excel into an in-process (DLL) OLE Server. The classes
provided by the in-process server must be created in a Microsoft Excel
macro, not by a Visual Basic program, unless the Visual Basic program is
another DLL loaded by Microsoft Excel.

   TITLE     : XL5: OLE Automation Example: Running Macro in Visual Basic
               3.0

</PRE>Workaround 2: Write Code to Avoid the Behavior
 
<P>
You can anticipate what methods may cause a dialog box to appear and write
the code to avoid the dialog box. This could also be true for screen
updating, but it sometimes can't be avoided.
<P>
Following are two examples of code using Microsoft Project as the OLE
controller application that will avoid prompts for user input. This code
could easily be applied to other OLE controller applications that support
OLE Automation.
<P>
The following Visual Basic for Applications macro uses OLE Automation to
delete a sheet in a newly created workbook and to save the workbook to the
hard drive. It avoids using the Delete method (which produces a warning
message) and uses the Move method, instead, to avoid the message.

<OL><P><LI>In Microsoft Project, create a new module sheet. To do this, on the
   Tools menu, click Macros, and then click New. For the Macro Name, type
   "Delete_WorkSheet" and click OK.

<P><LI>In the module, on the Tools menu, click References.

<P><LI>In the References dialog box, select the Microsoft Excel 5.0 Object
   Library check box and click OK.

<P><LI>On the new module sheet, enter the following macro (notice that the
   first and last line of code already exists from step 1 and does not need
   to be repeated):
<P>
<PRE>      Sub Delete_Worksheet()

         ' Dimension variables.

         ' This assumes that a reference has been made to
         ' the Microsoft Excel 5.0 Object Library.
         Dim oXL As Excel.Application
         Dim oWBook As Object

         ' Starts a new invisible instance of Microsoft Excel.
         Set oXL = CreateObject("Excel.Application")
         ' Adds a new workbook to the running instance of Microsoft Excel.
         Set oWBook = oXL.Workbooks.Add
         ' Moves the first sheet of the workbook into a new workbook
         ' and makes the new workbook active.
         oWBook.Sheets(1).Move
         ' Closes the new workbook containing the undesired sheet
         ' without saving changes.
         oXL.ActiveWorkbook.Close False
         ' Save the original workbook minus the first sheet with
         ' name as listed below. If running the procedure on the
         ' Macintosh, you will need to change the next line to a valid
         ' location on the hard drive similar to the following:
         ' oWBook.SaveAs FileName:="Macintosh HD:test.xls"
         '
         oWBook.SaveAs FileName:="C:\my documents\test.xls"
         ' Closes the original workbook without saving changes.
         oWBook.Close False
         oXL.Quit    ' Closes the invisible instance of Microsoft Excel.

         ' Clear memory by removing the contents of the two object
         ' variables created.
         Set oXL = Nothing
         Set oWBook = Nothing

      End Sub

</PRE></OL>The following Visual Basic for Applications macro uses OLE Automation to
save a workbook to the hard drive with the same name as an existing
workbook. It avoids the prompt "Replace existing file?" by saving the file
as another file name and renaming the file back to the desired name. The
same algorithm could be used when you're opening a Microsoft Excel file
that's in an earlier file format and re-saving it as the same name in the
normal Microsoft Excel format.

         Dim Fname As String

         ' Assign workbook file &amp; path that will be replaced to string

</PRE></OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
There are some tasks in Microsoft Excel that will cause Microsoft Excel to
interact with the user. For example, closing a workbook without saving
changes will cause Microsoft Excel to ask if the user wants to save
changes; deleting a sheet in a workbook will ask if the user is sure he or
she wants to delete it; saving a workbook to a name that already exists
will ask the user if the user is sure he or she wants to replace it. These
prompts may be inappropriate and confusing to the user. These prompts can
be disabled in a Visual Basic for Application macro in Microsoft Excel by
using the following line of code:
<P>
<PRE>   Application.DisplayAlerts = FALSE

   TITLE     : How to Avoid "Save Changes?" When You Close a Workbook

</PRE>Also, performing some tasks in Microsoft Excel will cause frequent screen
updates in Microsoft Excel and cause the screen to flash. This behavior may
also be inappropriate and confusing to the user. This may also slow down
Visual Basic for Applications macros that are run in Microsoft Excel. This
screen updating can be disabled in a Visual Basic for Application macro in
Microsoft Excel by using the following line of code:
<P>
<PRE>   Application.ScreenUpdating = FALSE

</PRE>However, neither of these properties are effectively set to FALSE when
they're being run in a line of code from an OLE controller application (for
example, Microsoft Project version 4.1 for Windows 95, Microsoft Project
version 4.0 for the Macintosh, Microsoft Word version 7.0 for Windows 95,
Microsoft Word version 6.0 for the Macintosh, Microsoft Visual Basic
version 4.0 for Windows 95). This is because each line of code is being
treated as a separate Microsoft Excel macro when commands are sent to
Microsoft Excel through OLE Automation.
