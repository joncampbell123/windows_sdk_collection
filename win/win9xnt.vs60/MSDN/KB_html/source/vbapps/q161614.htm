The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you do not specify a search direction when using the Microsoft Visual
Basic for Applications Find property, the search routine may go to the next
instance of a search string, the previous instance, or nothing happens.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs because the search function of Word remembers the last
direction and uses this as the default for the next search.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft provides examples of Visual Basic for Applications procedures
for illustration only, without warranty either expressed or implied,
including, but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability
and/or fitness for a particular purpose. The Visual Basic procedures in
this article are provided 'as is' and Microsoft does not guarantee that
they can be used in all situations. While Microsoft support engineers can
help explain the functionality of a particular macro, they will not modify
these examples to provide added functionality, nor will they help you
construct macros to meet your specific needs. If you have limited
programming experience, you may want to consult one of the Microsoft
Solution Providers. Solution Providers offer a wide range of fee-based
services, including creating custom macros. For more information about
Microsoft Solution Providers, call Microsoft Customer Information Service
at (800) 426-9400.
<P>
The following Find Object properties determine the search direction and
whether the search continues after you reach the beginning or end of the
document:
<P>
<P><h3>Forward Argument</h3>
 
<P>
The Forward argument specifies the direction to search. When you set the
value to True, the macro searches toward the end of the document. When you
set the value to False, the macro searches toward the beginning of the
document.
<P>
<P><h3>Wrap Property</h3>
 
<P>
The Wrap property returns or sets the event that occurs when the search
begins at a point other than the beginning of the document or if the search
text is not found in the specified selection or range. The Wrap property
can use any of the following WdFindWrap constants:
<P>
<PRE>Constant         Description
--------         -----------

wdFindAsk        After searching the selection or range, Word displays a
                 message asking whether to search the remainder of the
                 document.

wdFindContinue   The find operation continues when the beginning or end of
                 the search range is reached.

WdFindStop       The find operation ends when the beginning or end of the
                 search range is reached.

</PRE>The following Visual Basic for Applications examples set the search
direction:
<P>
<P><h3>Searching Downward</h3>
 
<P>
The following macro example searches downward.  When it reaches the end of
the document, it prompts you to continue searching from the beginning of
the document:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub SearchDown()
      Selection.Find.ClearFormatting
      With Selection.Find
         .Text = "Word"
         .Forward = True
         .Wrap = wdFindAsk
      End With
      Selection.Find.Execute
   End Sub

</PRE><h3>Searching Upward</h3>
 
<P>
The following macro example searches upward.  When it reaches the beginning
of the document, it prompts you to continue searching from the end of the
document:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub SearchUp()
      Selection.Find.ClearFormatting
         With Selection.Find
            .Text = "Word"
            .Forward = False
            .Wrap = wdFindAsk
         End With
         Selection.Find.Execute
   End Sub

</PRE><h3>Searching the Entire Document</h3>
 
<P>
The following macro example searches the entire document.  It does not
prompt you to continue searching when you reach the beginning or the end of
the document:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub SearchEntireDocument()
      Selection.Find.ClearFormatting
      With Selection.Find
         .Text = "Word"
         .Forward = True
         .Wrap = wdFindContinue
      End With
      Selection.Find.Execute
   End Sub

</PRE>For more information about using the Find Property, while in the Visual
Basic for Applications Editor, click the Office Assistant, type "Find"
(without the quotation marks), click Search, and then click to view "Find
Object."
<P>
NOTE: If the Assistant is hidden, click the Office Assistant button on the
Standard toolbar. If Microsoft Visual Basic Help is not installed on your
computer, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
