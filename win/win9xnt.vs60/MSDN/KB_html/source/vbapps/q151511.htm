SUMMARY
 
<P>
You can use the versions of Microsoft Excel listed at the beginning of
this article to modify data in a Microsoft Access database. Although
you can modify Microsoft Access databases in several different ways,
this article focuses on using QueryDefs to accomplish the task.
<P>
To modify data using a QueryDef, first create a QueryDef, and then a
Recordset based on search criteria. The data in the Recordset can then
be modified, and by using the UPDATE command, the data in the database
can be modified.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The macro described in this article modifies data using a QueryDef,
following these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Create a PARAMETERS clause string that includes a ParameterName and
    Data Type for each parameter. Don't use the field name alone as the
    ParameterName, because duplicating it may cause problems. You can,
    however, include the field name within the ParameterName.
<P>
    If you are working with a database accessed by Microsoft Access,
    the ParameterName is used as a prompt string. Keep this in mind if
    you want Microsoft Access users to use this query

<P><LI>Create a SELECT statement that retrieves the needed fields and
    incorporates the named parameters into the WHERE clause. In the
    example below, the parameters are used to filter the query to
    return only records for a specified country. "Germany" has been
    hard-coded into the code, but parameters can be set in many
    different ways. Note that the parameter [CountryWanted] is
    substituted by the Microsoft Jet database engine during execution
    of the query at run time.

<P><LI>Create a named QueryDef object with your SQL statement. This
    QueryDef is stored in your database.

<P><LI>Set the QueryDef object parameters. First, you need to gain access
    to the QueryDef object. In this case, all the customers in
    "GERMANY" will be found.

<P><LI>Execute the QueryDef. Because this query returns records, you need
    to create a RecordSet object to capture the result set.

<P><LI>Issue a MoveLast followed by a MoveFirst. This ensures that you
    have collected all the records that meet the criteria.

<P><LI>Set up a loop that will modify each record in the recordset. In
    this case, the "REGION" is set to "EUROPE" for each record. This
    recordset is comprised of customers in "GERMANY." Note that you
    need to issue an "Rs.Update" before moving to the next record, or
    the database will not be updated.
<P>
    At this point, the database has been modified. The rest of this
    code displays the data on a worksheet. This is not necessary to
    complete the operation.

<P><LI>Set up a loop that will collect the field names and place them in
    the first row starting at "A1". Then bold them.

<P><LI>Issue a MoveFirst to move to the beginning of the recordset.

<P><LI>Use "CopyFromRecordset" to move the data onto the worksheet.

<P><LI>Select the sheet that data was written to and autofit the column
    widths.

<P><LI>Clean up and delete the QueryDef that was just created. This
    removes it from the database. Then, close the objects.
<P>
</OL>Steps 1 through 5 in the following code were copied from "Creating
Parameter Queries with DAO" in the Microsoft Excel 7.0 Online Help. To
read the help topic, in Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0,
click Help and select Answer Wizard. In the Search edit box, type in
"Creating Parameter Queries with DAO" and click on the Search button.
Scroll down to "Programming and Language Reference" and double click
"Creating Parameter Queries with DAO,", or select this topic, and click
the Display button. This will display the code used to create this
article with amplification.
<P>
The search results will also display a number of help topics relating
to working with databases.
<P>
This code has been modified from the Help file to work with the
Northwind database. With Microsoft Office 7.0, the default location for
the Northwind database is C:\MSOffice\Access\Samples\Northwind.mdb.
With Microsoft Office 97, the default location for the Northwind
database is C:\Program Files\Microsoft
Office\Office\Samples\Northwind.mdb. You may need to modify the
OpenDatabase statement in this macro to specify the correct path to
the Northwind database for your installation of Microsoft Office.
<P>
Additionally, code has been added to demonstrate looping through a
RecordSet and writing a RecordSet to a worksheet.

<P>
NOTE: Before running this macro, you must create a reference to the correct
DAO Object Library for the version of Microsoft Excel you are using.
Microsoft Excel 95 uses the Microsoft DAO 3.0 Object Library and Microsoft
Excel 97 uses the Microsoft DAO 3.5 Object Library. To create a reference,
do the following:
<P>
<PRE>   1. On a Module sheet, click References on the Tools menu.

   2. Select Microsoft the correct DAO Object Library and click OK.
