<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
New programming functionality in Microsoft Excel 97 allows you to create a
collection. A collection is a predefined object that stores groups of
related objects. A collection makes it easier to work with the object
group. For example, you can use a For Each looping structure to loop
through the collection. Each time the macro executes the loop it references
a different object in the collection until all objects in the collection
are referenced once.
<P>
This article includes a sample Visual Basic for Applications macro that
creates and references a collection.
<P>

In general, declare an object as a new collection to create the collection.
After you create the Collection object, add items to the collection using
the Add method or remove items using the Remove method.

<OL><P><LI>Create a new workbook and start the Visual Basic Editor (press
    ALT+F11).

<P><LI>On the Insert menu, click Class Module.

<P><LI>In the class module, type the following declaration:
<P>
       Public EmployeeName As String
<P>
    You typically use a public variable in a class modules to define
    properties for the class.

</OL>Message boxes that display each of the names you typed appear. Then, a
message box that displays a count of the names you typed appears. Another
message box with a count of zero appears because the last For Each loop
removes each employee from the collection.
