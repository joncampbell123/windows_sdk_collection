The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 97, when you close the last open workbook, you may
receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down.
   If the problem persists, contact the program vendor.

</PRE>If you click Details, you receive an error message similar to the following
<P>
<PRE>   EXCEL caused an invalid page fault in module EXCEL.EXE at
   &lt;xxxx:yyyyyyyy&gt;.

</PRE>where &lt;xxxx:yyyyyyyy&gt; is any of the following addresses:
<P>
<PRE>   014f:300f1b0a   0137:3003cf1c
   014f:300ef16b
   014f:302946ee
   014f:3003cf1c

</PRE>or any other address starting with "014f:30" or "0137:".
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may occur when the following conditions are all true:

<UL><LI>You create the instance of Microsoft Excel 97 with the CreateObject
   method in a Visual Basic for Applications macro.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -and-
</PRE>
<LI>The Visual Basic code that creates the instance of Microsoft Excel
   carries out the following sequence of actions before releasing control:
<P>
   1. The macro creates a new workbook, or opens an existing workbook or
<P><PRE>      other file in the instance of Microsoft Excel.
</PRE><P>
   2. The macro makes the instance of Microsoft Excel 97 visible by 
<P><PRE>      setting its Visible property to True.
</PRE><P>
   3. The macro releases the Microsoft Excel 97 application object
<P><PRE>      without first closing the instance.
</PRE><P>
</UL><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft provides examples of Visual Basic for Applications procedures for
illustration only, without warranty either expressed or implied, including,
but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and/or fitness
for a particular purpose. The Visual Basic procedures in this article are
provided 'as is' and Microsoft does not guarantee that they can be used in
all situations. While Microsoft support engineers can help explain the
functionality of a particular macro, they will not modify these examples to
provide added functionality, nor will they help you construct macros to
meet your specific needs. If you have limited programming experience, you
may want to consult one of the Microsoft Solution Providers. Solution
Providers offer a wide range of fee-based services, including creating
custom macros. For more information about Microsoft Solution Providers,
call Microsoft Customer Information Service at (800) 426-9400.
<P>
To work around this problem, make the Microsoft Excel 97 application object
visible BEFORE you create a new workbook, or open an existing workbook or
other file. For example, instead of using the following code:
<P>
<PRE>   xlObj.Workbooks.Open "C:\My Documents\Test.xls"
   xlObj.Visible = True

</PRE>use this code:
<P>
<PRE>   xlObj.Visible = True
   xlObj.Workbooks.Open "C:\My Documents\Test.xls"

</PRE>When you switch the order of these two actions, the instance of Microsoft
Excel 97 that you create does not stop responding when you close the last
open workbook.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In Visual Basic, you can use the CreateObject method to create new
instances of applications. To create a new instance of Microsoft Excel 97,
you use the following code:
<P>
<PRE>   Set &lt;objectname&gt; = CreateObject("Excel.Application")

</PRE>where &lt;objectname&gt; is a variable that you declare as type Object.
<P>
If you create a new instance of Microsoft Excel 97, and then leave it open
for the user to close, the instance of Microsoft Excel 97 may stop
responding when you close the last open workbook. This behavior occurs if
the Visual Basic code opened or created any documents before making the
instance of Microsoft Excel 97 visible.
<P>
<PRE>   The following Visual Basic macro demonstrates the sequence of actions
   that cause the problem:

      Sub CreateMSXLObject()

          Dim xlObj As Object
          Set xlObj = CreateObject("Excel.Application")     'Action 1
          xlObj.Workbooks.Open "C:\My Documents\Test.xls"   'Action 2
          xlObj.Visible = True                              'Action 3
          Set xlObj = Nothing                               'Action 4

      End Sub
