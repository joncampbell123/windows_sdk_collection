<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Open statement is part of the Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications
language. This command allows you to open a data file for reading,
modifying, or adding to the file.
<P>
NOTE: The Open statement does not open the file into the workspace, it
merely opens the file for manipulation by your macro.
<P>
NOTE: The Open statement should not be used to open a program's own file
types. For example, do not use Open to open a Word document, a Microsoft
Excel spreadsheet, or a Microsoft Access database. Doing so will cause loss
of file integrity and file corruption.
<P>

</PRE>The correct syntax for the Open statement is:
<P>
<PRE>   Open pathname For mode [access] [lock] As [#]filenumber [Len=reclength]

</PRE>The Open statement syntax has the following parts.
<P>
<PRE>Part            Description
</PRE> 
<P>
<PRE>pathname        Required. String expression that specifies a file name may
                include directory or folder, and drive.

    mode        Required. Keyword specifying the file mode: Append, Binary,
                Input, Output, or Random. If unspecified, the file is
                opened for Random access.

  access        Optional. Keyword specifying the operations permitted on
                the open file: Read, Write, or Read Write.

    lock        Optional. Keyword specifying the operations permitted on
                the open file by other processes: Shared, Lock Read, Lock
                Write, and Lock Read Write.

filenumber      Required. A valid file number in the range 1 to 511,
                inclusive. Use the FreeFile function to obtain the next
                available file number.

reclength       Optional. Number less than or equal to 32,767 (bytes). For
                files opened for random access, this value is the record
                length. For sequential files, this value is the number of
                characters buffered.

</PRE><h3>Sample Visual Basic Procedure</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   Sub OpenExample()

      Dim sFirst, sLast, sAddress, sCity, sState, sZip As String

      ' CREATE DATA FILE
      ' Open file for input.
      Open "TextDataFile" For Output As #1

      ' Write data to file.
      Write #1, "John", "Doe", "An Address", "A City", "A State", "A Zip"

      ' Close file.
      Close #1

      ' RETRIEVE DATA FROM FILE
      ' Open file for input.
      Open "TextDataFile" For Input As #1

      ' Loop until the end of file is reached.
      Do While Not EOF(1)

         ' Read data into variables.
         Input #1, sFirst,sLast,sAddress,sCity,sState,sZip

         ' Print data to Debug window.
         Debug.Print sFirst,sLast,sAddress,sCity,sState,sZip

      Loop

      ' Close file.
      Close #1

   End Sub

</PRE>This macro creates or opens a file called "TextDataFile" and puts the
comma and quotation mark delimited data into the file. The data can then
later be retrieved using the Input # Statement.
