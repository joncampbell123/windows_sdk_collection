<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In WordPerfect there is a macro command called PAUSE that suspends the
macro for user input until the user presses ENTER, at which point the macro
continues. There is no equivalent command in Microsoft Visual Basic for
Applications. You can simulate this behavior using a macro that calls a
second macro when you press a specific key, such as the ENTER key.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>

Microsoft provides examples of Visual Basic for Applications procedures for

but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and/or fitness
for a particular purpose. The Visual Basic procedures in this article are
provided 'as is' and Microsoft does not guarantee that they can be used in
all situations. While Microsoft support engineers can help explain the
functionality of a particular macro, they will not modify these examples to
provide added functionality, nor will they help you construct macros to
meet your specific needs. If you have limited programming experience, you
may want to consult one of the Microsoft Solution Providers. Solution
Providers offer a wide range of fee-based services, including creating
custom macros. For more information about Microsoft Solution Providers,

<P>
You can simulate a pause in Visual Basic for Applications, by using two
macros: one macro runs the commands up to the "pause" and includes a key
assignment that initiates the second macro, which runs all commands that
occur after the pause. In the first macro (BeforePause), the ENTER key is
reassigned to run the second macro (AfterPause).
<P>
<PRE>   Sub BeforePause()
      '&lt;code&gt;
      '&lt;exit point&gt; - These commands should be placed outside of any error
      'traps.
      'Sets the Normal.dot to hold keyboard changes.
      CustomizationContext = NormalTemplate

      'This sets the ENTER key to run the "AfterPause" macro.
      KeyBindings.Add KeyCode:=BuildKeyCode(wdKeyReturn), _
      KeyCategory:=wdKeyCategoryCommand, Command:="AfterPause"

   End Sub

</PRE>The second macro runs after you press ENTER and then restores the
functionality of the ENTER key.
<P>
<PRE>   Sub AfterPause()

      'Sets the Normal.dot to hold keyboard changes.
      CustomizationContext = NormalTemplate

      'Disables the command associated with the ENTER key in the
      'BeforePause macro.
      FindKey(BuildKeyCode(wdKeyReturn)).Disable

      'Displays a message box.
      MsgBox "Hello"

   End Sub
