</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article contains a sample Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications
macro (Sub procedure) that copies all slides, as PowerPoint objects, from
your active presentation to another presentation. If you have one
presentation open, the macro creates and then adds the slides to the new
presentation. If you have two presentations open, the macro appends the
slides to the end of the second presentation.
