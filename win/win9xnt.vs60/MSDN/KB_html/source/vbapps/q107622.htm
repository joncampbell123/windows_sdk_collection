<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In the versions of Microsoft Excel listed at the beginning of this article, 
it is not possible to add a new sheet after the last sheet in the workbook 
in a single action. For example, if you have a workbook that contains 
Sheet1 and Sheet2 (in left-to-right sheet tab order), you cannot add a new 
sheet to the right of Sheet2.
<P>
This applies whether you add the new sheet manually, by using Visual Basic
code, or by using XLM macro code.
<P>
It is possible to add a new sheet to a workbook and make the sheet become
the last sheet in the workbook, but at least two separate actions are 
required to do this.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If your application requires that a new sheet be added or inserted after
the last sheet in the workbook, there are two ways that you can achieve
this task:
<P>
- If you manually add the new sheet to the workbook (by choosing the
<PRE>  appropriate item on the Insert menu, for example), you can drag the new
  sheet's tab to the right of all of the other sheet tabs. This makes the
  new sheet also become the last sheet in the workbook.

  -or-

</PRE>- If you are using a Visual Basic procedure to add the new sheet to the
<PRE>  workbook, you can use the Move method to move the new sheet to the proper
  location. The following example demonstrates using this method.

</PRE><h3>Visual Basic Code Example</h3>

</PRE>This sample Visual Basic code inserts a new sheet into a workbook and makes 
the new sheet become the last sheet in the workbook by moving it to the 
right of the rightmost sheet. This example assumes you have a workbook that 
contains at least one Visual Basic module and any number of other sheets.
<P>
To run the example, position the cursor in the line that reads "Sub 
AddNewSheet()" and either press F5 or click Start on the Run menu.
<P>
<PRE>   Sub AddNewSheet()

      Application.ScreenUpdating = False    ' Prevents screen refreshing.

      ' This line adds a new worksheet to the workbook. Alternatively, use:
      '
      ' DialogSheets.Add                    Adds a dialog sheet.
      ' Charts.Add                          Adds a chart sheet.
      ' Modules.Add                         Adds a Visual Basic module.
      ' Sheets.Add Type:=xlExcel4MacroSheet Adds an MS Excel 4.0 macro
      '                                     sheet.
      Worksheets.Add

      ' This line makes the new sheet (which is also the active sheet) the
      ' last sheet in the workbook.
      ActiveSheet.Move After:=Sheets(ActiveWorkbook.Sheets.Count)
      Application.ScreenUpdating = True     ' Enables screen refreshing.

   End Sub

</PRE>When you run the AddNewSheet Sub procedure, it will add a new sheet to the
active workbook and make the new sheet become the last sheet in the 
workbook.
<P>
If you try to add a new sheet after the last sheet in the workbook, all in
a single action, you will receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Add method of Sheet class failed

</PRE>For example, the following command will return an error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Worksheets.Add After:=Sheets(ActiveWorkbook.Sheets.Count)

</PRE>because it attempts to add a new sheet after the last sheet in the
workbook.
