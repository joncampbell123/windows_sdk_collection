<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multi-user skills.
<P>
This article defines a sample user-defined Visual Basic for Applications
routine that you can use to count the occurrence of a specific field value
in a record or recordset.
<P>
This article assumes that you are familiar with Visual Basic for
Applications and with creating Microsoft Access applications using the
programming tools provided with Microsoft Access. For more information
about Visual Basic for Applications, please refer to your version of the
"Building Applications with Microsoft Access" manual.
<P>
NOTE: Visual Basic for Applications is called Access Basic in Microsoft
Access version 2.0. For more information about Access Basic, please refer
to the "Building Applications" manual.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following function is designed for text fields, but it can be
modified to work with any data type and assumes that all fields are
of the same data type. This function is designed to work on a single
table or query; it accepts two arguments:

<UL><LI>Strval, a string used to identify the value or text
<LI>Sourcename, the name of the table or query to search
<P>
</UL><h3>Examples</h3>
 
<P>
To create the function, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Open the sample database Northwind.mdb (or NWIND.MDB in version 2.0)
   and create a new module.

<P><LI>Type the following lines in the Declarations section:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Dim strval As String
      Dim sourcename As String
</PRE>
<P><LI>Type one of the following procedures:

   Microsoft Access Version 7.0 and 97:

   NOTE: In the following sample code, an underscore (_) at the end of a
   line is used as a line-continuation character. Remove the underscore
   from the end of the line when re-creating this code in Access Basic.

         ' In version 7.0, the OLE data type returns a data type error 13
         ' on a comparison. This is to exclude that field from the search.
               If rs.Fields(I).Value = strval Then
                  Strval_Count = Strval_Count + 1

   Microsoft Access Version 2.0:

   NOTE: In the following sample code, an underscore (_) at the end of a
   line is used as a line-continuation character. Remove the underscore
   from the end of the line when re-creating this code in Access Basic.

    Function CountOccurrenceRecordset (strval As String, sourcename As _
      String)
      Dim db As Database, rs As Recordset, Strval_Count As Integer

      Set db = dbengine(0)(0)
      Set rs = db.OpenRecordset(sourcename, DB_OPEN_DYNASET)

      'Display count of sting in message box.
      CountOccurrenceRecordset = Strval_Count
    End Function

</PRE><P><LI>On the View menu, click Debug window (or Immediate window in version
   2.0), type the following line, and then press ENTER:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ? CountOccurrenceRecordset("Robert","Employees")
</PRE><P>
   Note that the message box returns "Count of Robert found = 1."
<P>
</OL>To demonstrate that more than one record can be found, open the Employees
table and change another employee's first name to Robert, commit the
record, and close the table. Then rerun the function in the Debug window
(or Immediate window in version 2.0).
<P>
If you want to search all fields in only one record, use the following
sample code for your version of Microsoft Access. This example searches
all fields in the first record only.

      String)
