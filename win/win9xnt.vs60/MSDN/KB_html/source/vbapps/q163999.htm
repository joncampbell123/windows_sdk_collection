<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multiuser skills.
<P>
This article provides two examples using the Winsock ActiveX control
installed with the Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition Tools.
<P>
This article assumes that you are familiar with Visual Basic for
Applications and with creating Microsoft Access applications using the
programming tools provided with Microsoft Access. For more information
about Visual Basic for Applications, please refer to the "Building
Applications with Microsoft Access 97" manual.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Winsock control enables you to connect to a remote computer and
exchange data between both client and server computers. The Winsock
control supports two protocols: Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
and User Datagram Protocol (UDP).
<P>
TCP is a connection-based protocol. A common analogy used to describe TCP
is that of a telephone. In this analogy, callers must establish a
connection on both ends of the telephone line before they can exchange
information. A computer using TCP must get confirmation from the receiving
computer that a connection has been established before the two computers
can transfer data.
<P>
UDP is a connectionless protocol. A common analogy used to describe UDP is
that of a radio. In this analogy, a radio station simply broadcasts its
signal without knowing for sure if anyone is listening. A computer using
UDP sends data and does not require a connection with the computer on the
receiving end of the transmission.
<P>
<P><h3>Example 1 - Using the Winsock ActiveX Control with TCP</h3>
 
<P>
This example uses the same computer to both send and to receive data. You
create a form with three Winsock controls. One of the controls emulates
the client computer environment; it sends a connection request to a
server. The other two controls emulate the environment on a server
computer: one control listens for a connection request, and the other
accepts the request when it comes.

<OL><P><LI>Create a new blank database named WinsockDemo.mdb.

<P><LI>Create a new form not based on any table or query in Design view:
<P>
