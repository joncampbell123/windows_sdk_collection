                               OVERVIEW
                               ========

</PRE>This Application Note will help you learn some techniques for writing
Visual Basic for Applications code for use with custom dialog boxes. The
Dlogsmpl.xls file included with this Application Note contains code
examples you can run. These code examples can be used with the following
elements: labels, edit boxes, group boxes, buttons, check boxes, option
buttons, list boxes, drop-down boxes, combination list-edit boxes,
combination drop-down edit boxes, scroll bars, and spinners. The
Dlogsmpl.xls file also contains code that demonstrates how to do the
following: set the focus in a dialog box, create a "masked" password dialog
box, adjust the dialog box height, and use the .Caller property.
<P>
The text of this Application Note includes additional explanations for some
of these elements, and it also points you to other sources of information.
Each section of the text contains an introduction for a particular control,
followed by some sample Visual Basic code. Some sections also contain a
brief description of the commonly used properties and methods for that
control.
<P>
Note that although the examples in this Application Note are created to
illustrate the use of controls on a dialog sheet, many of these controls
can be used on a worksheet or a chart sheet if you make minor changes to
the code. For more information about using controls in other types of
sheets, see Chapter 13 of the Microsoft Excel 5.0 "User's Guide" or Chapter
11 of the "Visual Basic User's Guide"; or see Chapter 8 of the "Microsoft
Excel/Visual Basic for Windows 95 Programmer's Guide."
<P>
Microsoft provides examples of Visual Basic procedures for illustration
only, without warranty either expressed or implied, including but not
limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and/or fitness for a
particular purpose. These Visual Basic procedures are provided 'as is' and
Microsoft does not guarantee that they can be used in all situations.
Microsoft does not support modifications of these procedures to suit
customer requirements for a particular purpose.
<P>
<P>
<PRE>           HOW TO USE THE EXAMPLES IN THIS APPLICATION NOTE
           ================================================

</PRE><h2>USING THE DLOGSMPL.XLS FILE</h2>
 
<P>
To use the Dlogsmpl.xls file, copy it to a directory on your hard disk
drive, and open it in Microsoft Excel.
<P>
<P><h3>To install Dlogsmpl.xls on your hard disk</h3>
 
<P>
Copy the Dlogsmpl.xls file from the directory to which you downloaded and
extracted WE1162.EXE to the appropriate directory on your hard disk.
<P>
For more information about copying files, see your Windows User's Guide or
Windows online Help.
<P>
<P><h3>To use Dlogsmpl.xls</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start Microsoft Excel, and click Open on the File menu.

<P><LI>Select the folder to which you installed the Dlogsmpl.xls file, select
   Dlogsmpl.xls, and click the Open button.
<P>
</OL><h2>USING THE EXAMPLES IN THE TEXT OF THIS APPLICATION NOTE</h2>
 
<P>
The examples in the text portion of this Application Note demonstrate ways
you can use Visual Basic for Applications code to accomplish basic tasks
with dialog box controls.
<P>
To use this code, set up your workbook as follows:

<UL><LI>The module containing the code must be located in the same workbook as
   the dialog sheet that contains the controls.

<LI>The dialog sheet that contains the controls must be named "Dialog1" and
   must be the first dialog sheet in the workbook.
<P>
</UL>In some examples, to run the sample code, you can click Macro on the Tools
menu, select the name of the macro, and click the Run button. In other
examples, you will run the code by assigning it to a control (usually a
button) in the dialog box, running the dialog box, and then choosing the
control. To run a dialog box, select the dialog sheet that contains the
dialog box and click the Run Dialog button on the Forms toolbar. (Examples
that require you to run the code this way contain instructions about which
control to assign the code to.)
<P>
For more information about associating a macro with a button, see the
"Assigning Code to Controls and Dialog Boxes" section of the Microsoft
Excel 5.0 "Visual Basic User's Guide," or see the "Assigning Code to
Controls" section of the "Microsoft Excel/Visual Basic for Windows 95
Programmer's Guide."
<P>
For more information about running a macro, see pages 14–15 of the
Microsoft Excel 5.0 "Visual Basic User's Guide," or click the Search button
in Help and type:
<P>

</PRE></OL>If you are using Microsoft Excel 7.0, see page 193 in the "Microsoft
Excel/Visual Basic for Windows 95 Programmer's Guide," or click Microsoft
Excel Help Topics on the Help menu, click the Index tab, and type:
<P>
<PRE>   running macros

</PRE>Also, note that in the sample code, objects are referred to by their
ordinal numbers rather than by name. For example, in code referring to the
first button in a dialog box, the button is referred to as Buttons(1)
rather than as Buttons("Button 12").
<P>
<PRE>     EXAMPLES OF VISUAL BASIC CODE TO USE WITH DIALOG BOX CONTROLS
     =============================================================

</PRE><h2>LABELS</h2>
 
<P>
Labels are mainly used to add descriptive text to other controls on a
dialog box. The most commonly used properties of this control are the .Text
and the .Caption properties, which are interchangeable. Labels cannot be
edited by the user while the dialog box is running, although a macro can
make changes to the text at any time.
<P>
NOTE: The font size of the text in a label is fixed. If you want to have a
control that resembles a label but has a font size and background color
that can be changed, use a text box. The Text Box button is located on the
Drawing toolbar.
<P>
<P><h3>To use a With statement to change the text property of a label</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create a dialog box with at least three label controls.

<P><LI>Enter the following code in a Visual Basic module:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub LabelExample1()
      With ThisWorkbook.DialogSheets("Dialog1")
         .labels(1).Text = "Labels can be an empty string"
         .labels(2).Text = ""
         .labels(3).Text = "...such as Label 2 above."
      End With
   End Sub

</PRE></OL><h3>To change the .Text property of a label using a For Each...Next statement</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create a dialog box with at least one label control.

<P><LI>Enter the following code in a Visual Basic module:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub LabelExample2()
      Dim Label As Variant
      For Each Label In ThisWorkbook.DialogSheets(1).labels
         Label.Caption = "Example text for" &amp; Label.Name
      Next Label
   End Sub

</PRE></OL><h3>To cycle through (index) a collection of dialog box labels</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create a dialog box with at least three label controls.

<P><LI>Enter the following code in a Visual Basic module:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub LabelExample3()
      Dim MyDlgLbls As Object, x as Integer
      Set MyDlgLbls = DialogSheets(1).labels
      For x = 1 To 3
         MyDlgLbls(x).Text = Format(Now + x, "dddd - mmmm,yyyy _
         hh:mm AM/PM")
      Next
   End Sub

</PRE></OL><h2>EDIT BOXES</h2>
 
<P>
Edit boxes are framed boxes that accept user input when the dialog box
is running. The font size for text in an edit box is fixed (that is,
it cannot be customized).
<P>
If you want text to wrap in an edit box, set the .MultiLine property
to true. To restrict the type of information the edit box will accept
(its input type), use the .InputType property. To set these
properties, use macro code, or select the edit box and choose Object
from the Format menu. If you set the .InputType property with code,
you can use the constants xlFormula, xlInteger, xlNumber, xlReference,
and xlText. The default input type is text (or xlText).
<P>
<P><h3>To retrieve the text in an edit box that has restricted input type</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create a dialog box with at least one edit box control. The edit box
   control will need to contain some information in order for the macro to
   work.

<P><LI>Enter the following code in a Visual Basic module:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub EditExample1()
      Dim theText As String
      With ThisWorkbook.DialogSheets(1).EditBoxes(1)
         .InputType = xlInteger
         theText = .Text
      End With
      MsgBox theText,,"Edit Box Value"
   End Sub

</PRE></OL><h3>To display information in an edit box</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create a dialog box with at least one edit box.

<P><LI>Enter the following code in a Visual Basic module
<P>
<PRE>   Sub EditExample2()
      ThisWorkbook.DialogSheets(1).EditBoxes(1).Text = "123"
   End Sub

</PRE></OL><h2>GROUP BOXES</h2>
 
<P>
Group boxes allow you to group controls on a dialog sheet, worksheet, or
chart sheet. Group boxes are especially useful for grouping option buttons-
-when option buttons are in a group box, only one of the option buttons can
be selected at a time. The font size and background color of a group box
cannot be changed.
<P>
Although group boxes display a group of objects, changes to the group box
do not affect the objects within that group box (that is, the objects
within a group box do not become a collection).
<P>
To change the text that is displayed along the top edge of a group box
control, use the .Caption property.
<P>
<P><h3>To change the caption text of a group box</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create a dialog box with at least one group box control.

<P><LI>Enter the following code in a Visual Basic module:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub GroupBoxExample1()
      With DialogSheets(1).GroupBoxes(1)
         If .Caption = "Example Caption Text" Then
            .Caption = "Another Example Caption Text"
         Else
            .Caption = "Example Caption Text"
            End If
      End With
   End Sub

</PRE></OL><h3>To hide a group box or make a group box visible</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create a dialog box with a group box control.

<P><LI>Enter the following code in a Visual Basic module:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub GroupBoxExample2()
      With DialogSheets(1).GroupBoxes(1)
         If .Visible = True Then .Visible = False Else .Visible = True
      End With
   End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>Add a button control and assign the GroupBoxExample2 macro to the
   button.
<P>
</OL><h2>BUTTONS</h2>
 
<P>
Buttons are primarily used for triggering an event. Some commonly used
button properties include: .DefaultButton, .CancelButton, .DismissButton,
and .HelpButton. You can set these properties using code, or you can set
them by selecting the button, clicking Object on the Format menu, and
selecting the Default, Cancel, Dismiss, and Help check boxes. These
properties control what happens to the dialog box when the user chooses a
button in that dialog box. For example, if you set a .DefaultButton
property to true, that button will be activated when the user presses the
enter key (if no other button has the focus on that dialog box). Only one
button in a dialog box can have the .DefaultButton property. For additional
information, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:

   TITLE     : XL5: Static and Dynamic Default Buttons

</PRE></OL>You cannot change the font or color of a button. However, once you
place the control on a dialog sheet, you can paste a picture over the
button to accomplish a similar effect. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

</PRE><h3>To use the .OnAction property to assign a macro to a button</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create a dialog box with at least three button controls. Note that a
   dialog sheet, by default, contains two buttons (OK and Cancel).

<P><LI>Enter the following code in a Visual Basic module:

<PRE>   Sub ButtonExample1()
      DialogSheets(1).Buttons(3).OnAction = "ChangeText"
   End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>To run the ButtonExample1 macro, you must also create the following
   function macro (this macro is assigned to the third button on the dialog
   box by the ButtonExample1 macro with the .OnAction property):
<P>
<P><PRE>      Function ChangeText()
       With DialogSheets(1).Buttons(3)
<PRE></PRE>         If .Text = "Run" Then
            .Text = "Stop"
         Else
            .Text = "Run"
         End If
       End With
      End Function

<OL><P><LI>Create a dialog box with at least three button controls.

<P><LI>Enter the following code in a Visual Basic module:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub ButtonExample2()

      End With
   End Sub

   Sub GetHelp()
      Application.Help "C:\WINDOWS\CALC.HLP"
   End Sub

   NOTE: In the code example above, because the Help property for
   button 3 is set to True, if you run the dialog box and press F1
   (or choose Help), Windows Calculator Help is displayed.

<P><h2>CHECK BOXES</h2>
 
<P>
Check boxes enable the user to select an item. When you use check
boxes in a group box, the user can select one or more items in the
group. The font and color of a check box are fixed (that is, they
cannot be customized). A check box can be in one of three states: on,
off, or mixed. To indicate the state of a check box, set the .Value.
property with the xlOn, xlOff, or xlMixed constant.

<P>
List boxes present the user with a list of scrollable items that can
be selected. Commonly used list box methods are .RemoveItem and
.RemoveAllItems. Note that these methods do not work if the list box
is linked to a worksheet. If you use a macro to set the selected
property in a list box item to false, it will not be reflected in the
list box while the dialog box is running. The font in a list box is
fixed (that is, it cannot be customized).

separate subroutines, the spinners can all be assigned to the same
subroutine. The following code assumes this type of situation.
