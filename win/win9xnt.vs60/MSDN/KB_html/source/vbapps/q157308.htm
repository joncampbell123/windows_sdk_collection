The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 97, a macro that makes a call to the RunAutoMacros
method may fail.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
If you call the RunAutoMacros method more than once in the same macro, only
the first call to RunAutoMacros works. Subsequent calls to run other
automatic procedures ("Auto" macros) fail to execute.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft provides examples of Visual Basic for Applications procedures for
illustration only, without warranty either expressed or implied, including,
but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and/or fitness
for a particular purpose. The Visual Basic procedures in this article are
provided 'as is' and Microsoft does not guarantee that they can be used in
all situations. While Microsoft support engineers can help explain the
functionality of a particular macro, they will not modify these examples to
provide added functionality, nor will they help you construct macros to
meet your specific needs. If you have limited programming experience, you
may want to consult one of the Microsoft Solution Providers. Solution
Providers offer a wide range of fee-based services, including creating
custom macros. For more information about Microsoft Solution Providers,
call Microsoft Customer Information Service at (800) 426-9400.
<P>
If you need to run two or more automatic procedures from another macro, you
can use the OnTime method to run both procedures. The following example
demonstrates how to do this:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub RunTwoAutoMacros()
       Application.OnTime Now + TimeValue("00:00:01"), "RunAutoOpen"
       Application.OnTime Now + TimeValue("00:00:02"), "RunAutoClose"
   End Sub

   Sub RunAutoOpen()
       ThisWorkbook.RunAutoMacros which:=xlAutoOpen
   End Sub

   Sub RunAutoClose()
       ThisWorkbook.RunAutoMacros which:=xlAutoClose
   End Sub

</PRE>When you run the RunTwoAutoMacros macro, the macro instructs Microsoft
Excel to run (in order) the two macros RunAutoOpen and RunAutoClose.
Because a separate macro contains each RunAutoMacros method, each method
works correctly when you run the macro that contains it.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, you can use the RunAutoMacros method to run various
automatic procedures, such as Auto_Open and Auto_Close, that are contained
in your workbook.
<P>
In earlier versions of Microsoft Excel, you can call the RunAutoMacros
method multiple times in a single macro. In Microsoft Excel 97, however,
you can call RunAutoMacros only once inside a single macro; subsequent
calls to RunAutoMacros fail.
