<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Word 95 does not appear in the Windows running objects table and
does not use Visual Basic as its macro language. This makes Microsoft
Word 95 difficult to detect from a Visual Basic application. This article
illustrates a technique that involves looping through all Windows and
checking for the "Microsoft Word" sub-string at the beginning of the title
bar.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The recommended method for checking for an instance of a Microsoft Office
application is to execute GetObject and trap for error 429, which will be
returned if there is no running instance. Because Microsoft Word 95 has no
application object, this approach fails and the error 429 will always be
returned.
<P>
However, because Microsoft Word, exclusively, always begins its title bar
text with the "Microsoft Word" sub-string, the GetWindowText API function
can be applied to each running window to detect the presence of Microsoft
Word 95. The following code demonstrates this procedure and works whether
or not Microsoft Word is visible or has a document open. This technique can
also be applied to any application that uses a top-level window that starts
its title bar text with a known sub-string. The call syntax is demonstrated
below:
<P>
<PRE>   boolVariable = GetWordWindow(strTitleStart, hwnd)

</PRE>where:

<UL><LI>boolVariable is set to true for success and false for failure
  (no window found).

<LI>GetWordWindow is the Visual Basic function that wraps the API function
   GetWindowText.

<LI>strTitleStart is the sub-string sought. If the title of any top level
   window begins with this sub-string, the handle of the first such
   instance will be returned. An empty string will be converted by the
   function to "Microsoft Word." The function is not case-sensitive.

<LI>hwnd is the window handle. The handle of the last top-level window is
   returned in case of failure.
<P>
</UL><h3>Step-by-Step Example</h3>
 
<P>
The project in this example runs as a form containing no controls. Clicking
on the form itself results in the display of a message box either stating,
"I did not find MS Word," indicating that Microsoft Word is not running, or
"I found MS Word and its handle is," and displaying the window handle. This
example works for all versions of Word for Windows:

<OL><P><LI>Open a new Project. Form1 is created by default.

<P><LI>From the Project menu (Insert menu in Visual Basic 4), insert a new
   Module (Module1).

<P><LI>Copy the Form Code below to the General Declarations section of Form1.

<P><LI>Copy the Module Code below to the General Declarations section of
   Module1. Be sure each API Declare Function statement is entered
   on a separate line (line-continuation underscore not allowed by
   Visual Basic).

<P><LI>Take care to remove a duplicate entry of the 'Option Explicit' line for
   the case when your Tools/Option/Environment/Require Variable
   Declaration CheckBox has been selected.
