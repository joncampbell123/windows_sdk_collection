<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multiuser skills.
<P>
This article demonstrates how to use data access objects (DAO) in Visual
Basic for Applications code to read the relationships from an external
Microsoft Access database and import those relationships that can be
successfully appended to the current database.
<P>
This article assumes that you are familiar with Visual Basic for
Applications and with creating Microsoft Access applications using the
programming tools provided with Microsoft Access. For more information
about Visual Basic for Applications, please refer to your version of the
"Building Applications with Microsoft Access" manual.
<P>
NOTE: Visual Basic for Applications is called Access Basic in Microsoft
Access version 2.0. For more information about Access Basic, please refer
to the "Building Applications" manual.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you attempt to append relationships in the current database, you can
append only those relationships that have table names and field names that
match those in the current database.
<P>
The following example demonstrates how to use Relation objects in DAO to
import the appropriate relationships into the current database:

<OL><P><LI>Create a new database called ImpRel.mdb.

<P><LI>Import the following tables from the sample database Northwind.mdb (or
   NWIND.MDB in version 2.0) to the ImpRel database:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Products
    - Customers
    - Orders
    - Order Details
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: In Microsoft Access 7.0 and 97, click the Options button in the
   Import Objects dialog box and clear the Relationships option before you
   import the tables.

<P><LI>Create a new module and type the following line in the declarations
   section:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Option Explicit
</PRE>
<P><LI>Type the following procedure:
<P>
   NOTE: In the following sample code, an underscore (_) is used as a
   line-continuation character. Remove the underscore from the end of the
   line when re-creating this code in Access Basic.

   among the tables are drawn automatically.
