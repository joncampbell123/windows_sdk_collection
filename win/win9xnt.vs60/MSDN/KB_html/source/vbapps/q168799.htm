<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article provides a procedure for parsing a single variable containing
a person's name into up to 6 parts:
<P>
<PRE>   Title                (Mr., Ms., etc.)
   First Name
   Middle Initial(s)
   Last Name
   Pedigree             (Jr., Sr., III, etc.)
   Degree(s)            (B.S., PhD, etc.)

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
WARNING: ANY USE BY YOU OF THE CODE/MACRO PROVIDED IN THIS ARTICLE IS AT
YOUR OWN RISK. Microsoft provides this code/macro "as is" without warranty
of any kind, either express or implied, including but not limited to the
implied warranties of merchantability and/or fitness for a particular
purpose.
<P>
NOTE: In the following sample code, an underscore (_) at the end of a line
is used as a line-continuation character. For versions of BASIC that don't
support line-continuation characters, remove the underscore from the
end of the line and merge with the following line when re-creating this
code.
<P>
Fields are parsed and removed from the name in the following order:
<P>
<PRE>  Title - (if the first word matches the list of standard titles)
  Degree - (anything after the first comma)
  Pedigree - (if the last word matches the list of standard pedigrees)
  Last Name - (must not contain spaces, but can be hyphenated)
  First Name - (must not contain spaces)
  Middle Initial(s) - (the remainder)

</PRE><h3>Step-by-Step Example</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Enter the following code:

</PRE><P><LI>To test, create a form with seven text boxes (txtName, txtTitle,
   txtFirstName, txtMI, txtLastName, txtPedigree, txtDegree), and a command
   button. Add the following code:
<P>
<PRE>      Sub Command1_Click()
      Dim Title As String, FName As String, MI As String
      Dim LName As String, Pedigree As String, Degree As String
        ParseName txtName, Title, FName, MI, LName, Pedigree, Degree
        txtTitle = Title
        txtFirstName = FName
        txtMI = MI
        txtLastName = LName
        txtPedigree = Pedigree
        txtDegree = Degree
      End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>Display the form, type a name into txtName, and click the command
   button. The other six fields should contain the parsed values.
<P>
</OL><h3>Additional Information</h3>
 
<P>
Other notes, limitations, and suggestions for improvement (left to the
reader's devices):

<OL><P><LI>The parsing routine assumes a comma before the Degree but not before the
   Pedigree. If there is a comma before the Pedigree, it will be included
   as part of the Degree(s). If you want to allow the Pedigree to be
   preceded by a comma, you can add an additional check to see if the first
   word (comma separated) of the Degree is in the list of standard
   Pedigrees.

<P><LI>The first and last names are assumed to contain no spaces. If they do
   (e.g. Mary Beth Saint John), part of the name (e.g. Beth Saint) will end
   up in the Middle Initial/Middle Name return value. Unfortunately, due to
   the high variability of this case, there is no good workaround other
   than manual intervention.

<P><LI>The parsing routine is designed for English/American names. Other
   languages may have different conventions that may require adjustments to
   the parsing code.

<P><LI>The list of standard Titles and Pedigrees may be easily extended by
   adding entries to the two Const declarations in ParseName.

<P><LI>The check for Title can be made more generic by looking for a period at
   the end of the first word if it is not already in the list of standard
   Titles.
