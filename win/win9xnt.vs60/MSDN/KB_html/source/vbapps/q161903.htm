<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Visual Basic for Applications in Microsoft Excel 97 incorporates many more
events for activating macros. Some of the new events include MouseDown,
MouseUp, KeyDown, and KeyUp. One of the Arguments returned by these
particular events, Shift, denotes which Key (SHIFT, CTRL, or ALT) on your
keyboard is pressed when one of the aforementioned events is triggered.
<P>
This articles provides a sample macro that shows how to use the Shift
argument returned by the MouseDown event of a CommandButton.
