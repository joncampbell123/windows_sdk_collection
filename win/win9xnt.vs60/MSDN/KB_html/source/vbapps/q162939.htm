The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you click Cancel in the Bullets And Numbering dialog box that appears
when you run a WordBasic macro that has been converted to a Visual Basic
for Applications macro that uses the FormatHeadingNumbering commands to
display the Bullets And Numbering dialog box, the macro skips the check
for the action of pressing Cancel.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft WordBasic you can check for a user clicking Cancel in a dialog
box by testing for a return value of zero. When the WordBasic object is
used in conjunction with a converted WordBasic macro, the value returned is
-1 instead of 0 when you click Cancel.
<P>
For example, the following code sample was converted from WordBasic to
Visual Basic for Applications:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub Main()
      Dim dlg As Object
      Set dlg = WordBasic.DialogRecord.FormatHeadingNumbering(False)
      WordBasic.CurValues.FormatHeadingNumbering dlg
      x = WordBasic.Dialog.FormatHeadingNumbering(dlg)
      ' In WordBasic, if the Cancel button was pressed, x will equal zero.
      If x = 0 Then
         ' Because Visual Basic for Applications WordBasic object returns
         '  -1 for Cancel, any commands in this If...Then...Else statement
         ' will be skipped when Cancel is clicked.
         MsgBox "Cancel was pressed."
      End If
   End Sub

</PRE><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>

Microsoft provides programming examples for illustration only, without

purpose. This article assumes that you are familiar with the programming
language being demonstrated and the tools used to create and debug
procedures. Microsoft support engineers can help explain the functionality
of a particular procedure, but they will not modify these examples to
provide added functionality or construct procedures to meet your specific
needs. If you have limited programming experience, you may want to contact
the Microsoft fee-based consulting line at (800) 936-5200. For more

<PRE>   <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/support/supportnet/refguide/default.asp">http://www.microsoft.com/support/supportnet/refguide/default.asp</A></B>

</PRE>To work around this problem, check for the value of -1 instead of zero as
in the following example:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub Main()
      Dim dlg As Object
      Set dlg = WordBasic.DialogRecord.FormatHeadingNumbering(False)
      WordBasic.CurValues.FormatHeadingNumbering dlg
      x = WordBasic.Dialog.FormatHeadingNumbering(dlg)
      ' If the Cancel button was pressed, x will equal -1.
      If x = -1 Then
         ' Perform actions based on the Cancel button being clicked.
      End If
   End Sub

</PRE>NOTE: Using Visual Basic for Applications commands without the WordBasic
object returns zero for a Cancel button. For example, the following
procedure performs the same functionality as the converted WordBasic macro
examples described earlier in this article:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub ShowDlg()
      ' Display the Bullets and Numbering Dialog.
      With Dialogs(wdDialogFormatBulletsAndNumbering)
         .DefaultTab = wdDialogFormatBulletsAndNumberingTabOutlineNumbered
         x = .Show
      End With
      ' If x=zero then the Cancel button was clicked.
      If x = 0 Then
         MsgBox "Cancel was pressed."
      End If
   End Sub
