<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multiuser skills.
<P>
This article demonstrates two procedures that use the EnumPrinters API
function to retrieve a list of printers available locally and that your
computer is connected to on the network.
<P>
The procedures demonstrate returning data to both the PRINTER_INFO_1
structure and the PRINTER_INFO_4 structure, each of which provides slightly
different information about the printer. If you are using Microsoft
Windows 95, you can return data to the PRINTER_INFO_1 structure; if you
are using Microsoft Windows NT, you can return data to either structure.
<P>
This article assumes that you are familiar with Visual Basic for
Applications and with creating Microsoft Access applications using the
programming tools provided with Microsoft Access. For more information
about Visual Basic for Applications, please refer to your version of the
"Building Applications with Microsoft Access" manual.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
WARNING: ANY USE BY YOU OF THE CODE PROVIDED IN THIS ARTICLE IS AT YOUR OWN
RISK. Microsoft provides this code "as is" without warranty of any kind,
either express or implied, including but not limited to the implied
warranties of merchantability and/or fitness for a particular purpose.
<P>
Use the subroutine EnumeratePrinters1 if you are running Microsoft
Windows 95. You can use either subroutine if you are running Microsoft
Windows NT.
<P>
The code in each of the two examples performs these steps:

<UL><LI>Calls the EnumPrinters API, which returns a buffer of data, a success
   flag, and a flag indicating whether the buffer is too small.

<LI>If the buffer is too small, makes it the correct size and calls the API
   again.

<LI>For each entry in the buffer, extracts the data and prints it.
<P>
</UL>NOTE: When using these functions in your own applications, you may want to
return an array of data that can be displayed in a list box or grid rather
than print the values.
<P>
The buffer is in the following format:
<P>
<PRE>    |rec1|rec2|...|recn|...garbage...|strn|...|str2|str1|

</PRE>INFO records containing string pointers and numeric values are added from
the left, and the string text for each record is added from the right. The
area between the end of the last record and the start of the last string
text contains garbage.
<P>
The buffer is declared as type Long, which makes extracting data from the
records easier - all fields are either Long or pointers (pointers map to
Long).
<P>
The StrLen() and PtrToStr() functions are used to set up the receiving
string variable and to copy the text from the buffer to the variable.
