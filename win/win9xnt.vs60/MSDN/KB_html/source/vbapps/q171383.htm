The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft PowerPoint 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run a Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications macro or procedure
that loops through one or more Microsoft Graph 97 objects in Microsoft
PowerPoint, the Windows 95 Close Program dialog box (or the Windows NT Task 
Manager) shows that a separate process for each graph remains after the
procedure ends. For example, if you have a procedure that loops through all
three graphs in a presentation, three copies of Graph8.exe remain running
after the procedure ends.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When you activate a Graph 8 object, PowerPoint creates a persistent data
pointer (IDispatch interface pointer) to the Graph 97 object. The
persistent data pointer allows quick access to the Graph object in case it
is needed again. PowerPoint releases the pointer when the presentation is
closed, and Graph 8 unloads itself from memory.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, close and then reopen the presentation that
contains the Graph objects that were edited.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1: Manually Close the Presentation</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>On the File menu, click Close.
<P>
   This process removes any Graph objects from memory that are associated
   with the presentation.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Open.
<P>
   Open the presentation you just closed; no Graph objects are activated
   yet.
<P>
</OL><h3>Method 2: Use a Visual Basic Macro to Close the Presentation</h3>
 
<P>

provide added functionality or construct procedures to meet your specific
needs. If you have limited programming experience, you may want to contact

</PRE></OL>The sample code assumes the following:

<UL><LI>The presentation that contains the Graph objects is the active
   presentation.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>You are running this procedure from a presentation that is not the
   active presentation. For example, if you run this code from the
   presentation you are trying to close, the procedure ends after the
   ActivePresentation.Close statement, because you just closed the
   presentation that contains the code.
<P>
</UL><h3>Sample Visual Basic Procedure</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   Sub ReloadPresentation()

      Dim strPresPathName As String
      Dim lCurrentView As Long
      Dim lSlideNumber As Long

      ' Determine what view the presentation is in.
      lCurrentView = ActiveWindow.ViewType

      ' If the active view is slide view, get
      ' the slide number.
      If ActiveWindow.ViewType = ppViewSlide Then
         lSlideNumber = ActiveWindow.View.Slide.SlideNumber
      End If

      ' Save the presentation, if needed.
      If ActivePresentation.Saved = msoFalse Then
         ActivePresentation.Save
      End If

      ' Get the name and path to the active presentation.
      strPresPathName = ActivePresentation.FullName

      ' Close the presentation.
      ActivePresentation.Close

      ' Reopen the presentation.
      Presentations.Open strPresPathName

      ' Restore the view.
      ActiveWindow.ViewType = lCurrentView

      ' If in slide view, restore the slide number.
      If ActiveWindow.ViewType = ppViewSlide Then
         ActiveWindow.View.GotoSlide lSlideNumber
      End If

   End Sub
