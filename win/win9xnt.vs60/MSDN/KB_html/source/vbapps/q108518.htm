The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0c
<LI>Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, versions 5.0, 5.0a
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows NT, version 5.0

</UL>

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In the versions of Microsoft Excel listed at the beginning of this article, 
the Range.EntireRow method may return an incorrect result if the Range is a 
nonadjacent selection. For example, if the current Range is the nonadjacent 
selection $A$1:$A$3, $C$11:$C$13, the Range.EntireRow method will return 
$1:$13, not $1:$3,$11:$13 as would be expected. This also occurs when you 
use the Range.EntireColumn method to return entire columns when the Range 
is nonadjacent.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To return the correct rows or columns in a selection when the selection is
nonadjacent, you must separate the selection into Areas, where an Area is
defined as a single piece of a nonadjacent selection. This process is
illustrated in the Visual Basic code example below.
<P>
<P><h3>Visual Basic Code Example</h3>

language being demonstrated and the tools used to create and debug
procedures. Microsoft support engineers can help explain the functionality
of a particular procedure, but they will not modify these examples to
provide added functionality or construct procedures to meet your specific
needs. If you have limited programming experience, you may want to contact
the Microsoft fee-based consulting line at (800) 936-5200. For more
information about the support options available from Microsoft, please see
the following page on the World Wide Web:

<PRE>   <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/support/supportnet/refguide/default.asp">http://www.microsoft.com/support/supportnet/refguide/default.asp</A></B>

</PRE>NOTE: To convert this example to work with columns, use "Column" in place
of "Row".
<P>
To use the SelectRows Sub procedure, select any combination of cells on
Sheet1. (This example assumes the current selection is 
$A$1:$A$3,$C$11:$C$13 on Sheet1.) Then, click Macro on the Tools menu, 
select the name SelectRows from the list of macro names, and click Run.
<P>
<PRE>   Option Explicit

   Sub SelectRows()

      ' Dimension some variables.
      Dim Counter As Integer, X As Variant, Y As Variant

      Sheets("Sheet1").Activate          ' Ensure the worksheet is active.

      ' Sets range X equal to the current selection.
      Set X = Selection
      ' Initializes range Y equal to the first Area in X.
      Set Y = X.Areas(1)

      ' Iterate through the loop once for each Area (nonadjacent piece)
      ' of the range X.
      For Counter = 1 To X.Areas.Count
         ' Set Y equal to the union of its previous range and the range of
         ' the rows which encompass the current Area.
         Set Y = Application.Union(Y, X.Areas(Counter).EntireRow)
      Next                                ' Loop until done.

      Y.Select                            ' Select the range Y.

   End Sub

</PRE>For example, if you select the range $A$1:$A$3,$C$11:$C$13 on worksheet
Sheet1 and then run the SelectRows Sub procedure, the procedure determines
how many Areas there are in the selection (there are two: $A$1:$A$3 and
$C$11:$C$13), determines which combination of rows encompasses each Area
($1:$3, $11:$13), and selects the range $1:$3,$11:$13.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the versions of Microsoft 
Excel listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected 
in Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows and Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
You can create a nonadjacent selection by selecting a range and then
selecting another range while holding down the CTRL key on your keyboard or
by using Microsoft Excel version 4.0 or Visual Basic commands that select
two or more ranges at the same time.
