The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access versions 7.0, 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multiuser skills.
<P>
This article contains an example that shows you how to refresh linked
tables in your database using the Common Dialog control that is available
with the Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition Tools or the Microsoft
Access Developer's Toolkit version 7.0. The tables being linked may reside
in one or many back-end databases.
<P>
For an example of a different method to relink tables that uses Windows
application programming interface (API) functions, refer to the Developer
Solutions sample application (Solutions.mdb) included with Microsoft Access
7.0 and 97. Open the Solutions.mdb database, select "Use multiple
databases" in the "Select a Category of Examples" box, and then "Link
tables at startup" in the Select An Example box.
<P>
This article assumes that you are familiar with Visual Basic for
Applications and with creating Microsoft Access applications using the
programming tools provided with Microsoft Access. For more information
about Visual Basic for Applications, please refer to your version of the
"Building Applications with Microsoft Access" manual.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
An application that uses split database design has its tables in one
database in a shared network location (the back-end database), and all its
queries, forms, reports, macros, and modules in another database on each
client computer (the front-end database). The front-end database links all
of its tables to the back-end database. If the back-end database is moved,
errors occur in your application. You can build functionality into your
application to detect that the back-end database file is missing from its
expected location, and then prompt the user for the new location.
<P>
The following example demonstrates a method for relinking table data in
your application. This method creates a form that a user can open to relink
the back-end tables, and optionally uses a form to automatically verify the
back-end link behind the scenes.
<P>
This article assumes that you have the Microsoft Common Dialog control,
which is available with the Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition Tools and
the Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit version 7.0. If you do not have
this control, skip the Browse() function in the example.
<P>
NOTE: If you use the Common Dialog control and you plan to distribute your
database application, you must include the Common Dialog Control file,
Comdlg32.ocx, and its supporting DLLs with your setup files. For more
information about which supporting files to include with ActiveX controls
in Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition Tools applications, search the
Help Index for "ActiveX controls, files required for." For more information
about which supporting files to include with OLE Custom Controls in
Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit version 7.0 applications, click the
Help button on the "Add the files that you want your custom Setup program
to copy" screen of the Setup Wizard.

<P><h3>Method to Relink Back-End Database Tables</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>  1. Create a new blank database called FrontEnd.mdb.

  2. On the File menu, point to Get External Data, and then click Link
     Tables. Create a link to each of the tables in the sample database
     Northwind.mdb.

  3. Create the following new form not based on any table or query in
     Design view:

       Form: frmNewDataFile
       --------------------------

       Text box:
          Name: txtFileName
          Width: 3"
       Common Dialog control:
          Name: xDialog
       Command button:
          Name: cmdBrowse
          Caption: Browse...
          OnClick: =Browse()
       Command button:
          Name: cmdLinkNew
          Caption: Refresh Links
          OnClick: =Processtables()
       Command button:
          Name: cmdCancel
          Caption: Cancel
          Cancel: Yes

  4. On the View menu, click Code.

  5. Type or paste the following procedure:

       Private Sub cmdCancel_Click()
       On Error GoTo Err_cmdCancel_Click
       MsgBox "Link to new back-end cancelled", vbExclamation, _
       "Cancel Refresh Link"   ' Give a warning of cancellation.
       DoCmd.Close acForm, Me.Name   ' Close the form.
       Exit_cmdCancel_Click:
       Exit Sub
       Err_cmdCancel_Click:
       MsgBox Err.Description
       Resume Exit_cmdCancel_Click
       End Sub

  6. On the Debug menu, click "Compile and Save All Modules" (or in
     Microsoft Access 7.0, on the Run menu click "Compile All Modules";
     then on the File menu, click "Save All Modules").

  7. Save the frmNewDataFile form and close it.

  8. In the Database Window, click the Modules tab,

  9. Create a new module and type or paste the following code:

       Option Compare Database
       Dim UnProcessed As New Collection
       Option Explicit

       Public Function Browse()
       ' Prompts user for back-end database file name.
       On Error GoTo Err_Browse
       Dim strFilename As String
       Dim oDialog As Object
       Set oDialog = [Forms]![frmNewDatafile]!xDialog.Object
       With oDialog   ' Ask for new file location.
         .DialogTitle = "Please Select New Data File"
         .Filter = "Access Database(*.mdb;*.mda;*.mde;*.mdw)|" &amp; _
         "*.mdb; *.mda; *.mde; *.mdw|All(*.*)|*.*"
         .FilterIndex = 1

         ' If user responded, put selection into text box on form.
         If Len(.FileName) &gt; 0 Then _
         [Forms]![frmNewDatafile]![txtFileName] = .FileName
       End With

 10. On the Debug menu, click "Compile and Save All Modules" (in Microsoft
     Access 7.0, on the Run menu click "Compile All Modules"; then on the
     File menu, click "Save All Modules").

 11. Save the module as RelinkCode and close it.

 12. Move the Northwind.mdb sample database to another folder on your hard
     drive, so the linked tables in FrontEnd.mdb will need to be refreshed.

 13. Open the frmNewDataFile form, and click the Browse button.

 14. In the "Please Select New Data File" dialog box, locate Northwind.mdb
     in its new folder, and then click Open. Note that the path and file
     name of the database appears in the text box on your form.

 15. Click the Refresh Links button on the form. Note that you receive the
     following  message when the procedure is done:

       Linking to new back-end data file was successful.

</PRE><h3>Creating a Startup Form to Check Linked Tables</h3>
 
<P>
If you want to verify the linked tables automatically each time that you
open the FrontEnd.mdb database, you can follow these steps to create a
hidden form for that purpose:

<OL><P><LI>Create a new form not based on any table or query in Design view.
