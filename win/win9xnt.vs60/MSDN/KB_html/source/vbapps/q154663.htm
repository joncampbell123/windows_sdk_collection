<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
By default, page setup attributes, such as margins, sheet orientation, and 
print titles, are set individually (on a worksheet-by-worksheet basis). 
However, you can set some of these attributes globally by using any of the 
following methods:

<UL><LI>Use a template.
<LI>Select multiple worksheets and apply the attributes to that group of
   worksheets.
<LI>Use a macro to set attributes for all sheets in the workbook.
<P>
</UL>The "More Information" section of this article discusses these options in
more detail.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1: Use a Template</h3>
 
<P>
For information about using templates to set page orientation, click the 
Index tab in Help, and type:
<P>
<PRE>      page setup, storing settings in a template

</PRE><h3>Method 2: Change a Group of Worksheets</h3>
 
<P>
Select multiple worksheets and apply the attributes to that group of 
worksheets. To select multiple worksheets, press and hold the SHIFT key, 
and click the sheets you want to select.
<P>

</PRE>Modify the page setup attributes with a macro. The sample macros in this 
article demonstrate how to change page orientation in the active workbook 
and in an open workbook that is not the active workbook. 
<P>
NOTE: These macros use the Orientation property of the PageSetup object. To 
modify other page setup attributes, use other PageSetup properties, such as 
LeftMargin, RightMargin, and so on.
<P>
Macros to Change Page Orientation:
<P>
This macro sets page orientation for all sheets in the active workbook to 
be the same as the first sheet in the workbook.
<P>
<PRE>   Sub SetAttributes()
      For Each xWorksheet In ActiveWorkbook.Worksheets
         xWorksheet.PageSetup.Orientation = _
            Worksheets("Sheet1").PageSetup.Orientation
      Next xWorksheet
   End Sub

   ' The workbook containing the following macro also includes a
   ' worksheet called Sheet1, which is the source of the PageSetup
   ' information that you want to use to format the worksheets in
   ' another workbook.

   ' Before you run this macro, make sure that the second workbook
   ' is active.

   Sub SetWorkbookAttributes()
      For Each xWorksheet In ActiveWorkbook.Worksheets
         xWorksheet.PageSetup.Orientation = _
            ThisWorkbook.Worksheets("Sheet1").PageSetup.Orientation
      Next xWorksheet
   End Sub

</PRE>If you want to change additional page setup properties for worksheets, you 
can add additional lines within the For Each...Next statement in each Sub 
procedure. The lines should be identical to the example lines provided 
here, except that the property (Orientation) can be changed as appropriate 
(CenterFooter, PaperSize, and so on).
