<P>
<PRE>   ActiveCell.Offset(5, -4).Select

</PRE>To select a cell that is two rows above and three columns to the right of 
the active cell, you can use the following example:
<P>
<PRE>   ActiveCell.Offset(-2, 3).Select

</PRE>NOTE: An error will occur if you attempt to select a cell that is "off the
worksheet." The first example shown above will return an error if the
active cell is in columns A through D, since moving four columns to the
left would take the active cell to an invalid cell address.
<P>
<P><h3>11: How to Select a Cell Relative to Another (Not the Active) Cell</h3>
 
<P>
To select a cell that is five rows below and four columns to the right of 
cell C7, you can use either of the following examples:

but that is shifted four rows down and three columns to the right, you can 
use the following example:
<P>
<PRE>   ActiveSheet.Range("Test").Offset(4, 3).Select

</PRE>If the named range is on another (not the active) worksheet, activate that 
worksheet first, and then select the range using the following example:
<P>
<PRE>   Sheets("Sheet3").Activate
   ActiveSheet.Range("Test").Offset(4, 3).Select

</PRE><h3>13: How to Select a Specified Range and Resize the Selection</h3>
 
<P>
To select the named range "Database" and then extend the selection by five 
rows, you can use the following example:
<P>
<PRE>   Range("Database").Select
   Selection.Resize(Selection.Rows.Count + 5, _
      Selection.Columns.Count).Select

</PRE><h3>14: How to Select a Specified Range, Offset It, and Then Resize It</h3>
 
<P>
To select a range four rows below and three columns to the right of the 
named range "Database" and include two rows and one column more than the 
named range, you can use the following example:
<P>
<PRE>   Range("Database").Select
   Selection.Offset(4, 3).Resize(Selection.Rows.Count + 2, _
      Selection.Columns.Count + 1).Select

</PRE><h3>15: How to Select the Union of Two or More Specified Ranges</h3>
 
<P>
To select the union (that is, the combined area) of the two named ranges 
"Test" and "Sample," you can use the following example:
<P>
<PRE>   Application.Union(Range("Test"), Range("Sample")).Select

</PRE>Note that both ranges must be on the same worksheet for this example to
work. Note also that the Union method does not work across sheets. For
example, this line works fine:
<P>
<PRE>   Set y = Application.Union(Range("Sheet1!A1:B2"), Range("Sheet1!C3:D4"))

</PRE>but this line:
<P>
<PRE>   Set y = Application.Union(Range("Sheet1!A1:B2"), Range("Sheet2!C3:D4"))

</PRE>returns the error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Union method of application class failed

</PRE><h3>16: How to Select the Intersection of Two or More Specified Ranges</h3>
 
<P>
To select the intersection of the two named ranges "Test" and "Sample," you 
can use the following example:
<P>
<PRE>   Application.Intersect(Range("Test"), Range("Sample")).Select

</PRE>Note that both ranges must be on the same worksheet for this example to 
work.
<P>
Examples 17-21 in this article refer to the following example set of data.
Each example states the range of cells in the sample data that would be
selected.
<P>
<PRE>   A1: Name    B1: Sales    C1: Quantity
   A2: a       B2: $10      C2: 5
   A3: b       B3:          C3: 10
   A4: c       B4: $10      C4: 5
   A5:         B5:          C5:
   A6: Total   B6: $20      C6: 20

</PRE><h3>17: How to Select the Last Cell of a Column of Contiguous Data</h3>
 
<P>
To select the last cell in a contiguous column, use the following example:
<P>
<PRE>   ActiveSheet.Range("a1").End(xlDown).Select

</PRE>When this code is used with the sample table, cell A4 will be selected.
<P>
<P><h3>18: How to Select the Blank Cell at Bottom of Column of Contiguous Data</h3>
 
<P>
To select the cell below a range of contiguous cells, use the following
example:
<P>
<PRE>   ActiveSheet.Range("a1").End(xlDown).Offset(1,0).Select

</PRE>When this code is used with the sample table, cell A5 will be selected.
<P>
<P><h3>19: How to Select an Entire Range of Contiguous Cells in a Column</h3>
 
<P>
To select a range of contiguous cells in a column, use one of the following
examples:
<P>
<PRE>   ActiveSheet.Range("a1", ActiveSheet.Range("a1").End(xlDown)).Select

   -or-

   ActiveSheet.Range("a1:"&amp;ActiveSheet.Range("a1"). _
      End(xlDown).Address).Select

</PRE>When this code is used with the sample table, cells A1 through A4 will be
selected.
<P>
<P><h3>20: How to Select an Entire Range of Non-Contiguous Cells in a Column</h3>
 
<P>
To select a range of cells that are non-contiguous, use one of the
following examples:
<P>
<PRE>   ActiveSheet.Range("a1",ActiveSheet.Range("a16384").End(xlUp)).Select

   -or-

   ActiveSheet.Range("a1:" &amp; ActiveSheet.Range("a16384"). _
      End(xlUp).Address).Select

</PRE>When this code is used with the sample table, it will select cells A1
through A6.
<P>
<P><h3>21: How to Select a Rectangular Range of Cells</h3>
 
<P>
In order to select a rectangular range of cells around a cell, use the
CurrentRegion method. The range selected by the CurrentRegion method is an
area bounded by any combination of blank rows and blank columns. The
following is an example of how to use the CurrentRegion method:
<P>
<PRE>   ActiveSheet.Range("a1").CurrentRegion.Select

</PRE>This code will select cells A1 through C4. Other examples to select the
same range of cells are listed below:
<P>
<PRE>   ActiveSheet.Range("a1", _
      ActiveSheet.Range("a1").End(xlDown).End(xlToRight)).Select

   -or-

   ActiveSheet.Range("a1:" &amp; _
     ActiveSheet.Range("a1").End(xlDown).End(xlToRight).Address).Select

</PRE>In some instances, you may want to select cells A1 through C6. In this
example, the CurrentRegion method will not work because of the blank line
on Row 5. The following examples will select all of the cells:
<P>
<PRE>   lastCol = ActiveSheet.Range("a1").End(xlToRight).Column
   lastRow = ActiveSheet.Cells(16384, lastCol).End(xlUp).Row
   ActiveSheet.Range("a1", _
      ActiveSheet.Cells(lastRow, lastCol)).Select

    -or-

   lastCol = ActiveSheet.Range("a1").End(xlToRight).Column
   lastRow = ActiveSheet.Cells(16384, lastCol).End(xlUp).Row
   ActiveSheet.Range("a1:" &amp; _
      ActiveSheet.Cells(lastRow, lastCol).Address).Select

</PRE><P><LI>  How to Select Multiple Non-Contiguous Columns of Varying Length
</OL> 
<P>
To select multiple non-contiguous columns of varying length, use the
following sample table and macro example:
<P>
<PRE>   A1: 1 B1: 1 C1: 1 D1: 1
   A2: 2 B2: 2 C2: 2 D2: 2
   A3: 3 B3: 3 C3: 3 D3: 3
   A4:   B4: 4 C4: 4 D4: 4
   A5:   B5: 5 C5: 5 D5:
   A6:   B6:   C6: 6 D6:

   StartRange = "A1"
   EndRange = "C1"
   Set a = Range(StartRange, Range(StartRange).End(xlDown))
   Set b = Range(EndRange, Range(EndRange).End(xlDown))
   Union(a,b).Select

</PRE></OL>When this code is used with the sample table, cells A1:A3 and C1:C6 will be
selected.
<P>
<P><h2>NOTES ON THE EXAMPLES</h2>
 

<UL><LI>The ActiveSheet property can usually be omitted, because it is implied
   if a specific sheet is not named. For example, instead of
<P>
<P><PRE>      ActiveSheet.Range("D5").Select
</PRE><P>
   you can use:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Range("D5").Select
</PRE>
<LI>The ActiveWorkbook property can also usually be omitted. Unless a
   specific workbook is named, the active workbook is implied.

<LI>When you use the Application.Goto method, if you want to use two 
   Cells methods within the Range method when the specified range is on
   another (not the active) worksheet, you must include the Sheets 
   object each time. For example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Application.Goto _
<PRE></PRE>         (Sheets("Sheet1").Range(Sheets("Sheet1").Cells(2, 3), _
         Sheets("Sheet1").Cells(4, 5)))

</PRE><LI>You cannot use the Select method to select a range on any sheet
   other than the active sheet. Instead, you can either use the Activate
   method to activate the correct sheet and then use the Select method,
   or you can use the Application.Goto method to select the range.

<LI>For any item in quotation marks (for example, the named range "Test"),
   you can also use a variable whose value is a text string. For example,
   instead of:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ActiveWorkbook.Sheets("Sheet1").Activate
</PRE><P>
   you can use:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ActiveWorkbook.Sheets(myVar).Activate
</PRE><P>
   where the value of myVar is "Sheet1".
