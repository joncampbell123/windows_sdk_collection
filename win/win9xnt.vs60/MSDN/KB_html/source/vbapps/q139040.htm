The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access versions 2.0, 7.0, 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multiuser skills.
<P>
If the currently active control on the screen is in a subform,
Screen.ActiveControl will correctly reference this control.
Screen.ActiveForm, however, will reference the main form and not the
subform the control is contained on.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
A subform is not really a form, but a control (just like a text box or
command button) that appears on a form. Screen.ActiveForm will always
return the active form, not a subform control.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
You can use the Set_Screen_ActiveSubformControl function provided below to
determine what subform control contains the Screen.ActiveControl. This
function will set a global control variable Screen_ActiveSubformControl to
the currently active subform control on screen.
<P>
<PRE>   Syntax:

      Function Set_Screen_ActiveSubformControl()

   Return:

      True:  Screen_ActiveSubformControl was set to the subform control
             that contains Screen.ActiveControl.
      False: Screen.ActiveControl does not exist or is not in a subform.

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following information describes how to create a module with the
Set_Screen_ActiveSubformControl() function. Further, information is
provided demonstrating how to use this function using the sample database
Northwind.mdb (or NWIND.MDB in 2.0).
<P>
This article assumes that you are familiar with Visual Basic for
Applications and with creating Microsoft Access applications using the
programming tools provided with Microsoft Access. For more information
about Visual Basic for Applications, please refer to your version of the
"Building Applications with Microsoft Access" manual.
<P>
NOTE: Visual Basic for Applications is called Access Basic in Microsoft
Access version 2.0. For more information about Access Basic, please refer
to the "Building Applications" manual.
<P>
NOTE: In the following sample code, an underscore (_) at the end of a line
is used as a line-continuation character. Remove the underscore from the
end of the line when re-creating this code in Access Basic.

<P>
The following information demonstrates how to use the
Set_Screen_ActiveSubformControl() function using the sample database
Northwind.mdb (or NWIND.MDB in 2.0).

<OL><P><LI>Open the sample database Northwind.mdb and follow the steps above
   to create the module containing the Set_Screen_ActiveSubformControl
   procedure.

      --------------------------------------------
      RunCode
         Function Name: =DisplayActiveSubformName()

<P><LI>View the Customers form in Form view. Note that the Orders subform
   contains only orders for the current customer.

<P><LI>Set the focus to a control in the Customers form, the Orders form
   (subform), or the Orders Subform (sub-subform) and press the F2 key.
