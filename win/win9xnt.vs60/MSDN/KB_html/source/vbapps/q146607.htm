<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0
<LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In the versions of Microsoft Excel listed at the beginning of this
article, you can use data access objects (DAO) in Visual Basic for
Applications to retrieve the results of a Parameter QueryDef from
Microsoft Access. This article demonstrates how to do so.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
A Parameter QueryDef is created in Microsoft Access and saved with the
database file. It consists of a query, which waits for a parameter to be
passed to it, and may or may not include criteria.
<P>
Retrieving the results of a QueryDef from Microsoft Access involves the
following general process:

<UL><LI>Establish a Database object.

<LI>Establish a QueryDef object.

<LI>Establish a Recordset Object.

<LI>Pass a parameter to the QueryDef.

<LI>Retrieve the Headers (if desired).

<LI>Retrieve the data from the table.
<P>
</UL>After the data is retrieved, you should close all the objects you opened
by issuing .Close commands.
<P>
<P><h3>Example</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft provides examples of Visual Basic for Applications procedures
for illustration only, without warranty either expressed or implied,
including, but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability
and/or fitness for a particular purpose. The Visual Basic procedures in
this article are provided 'as is' and Microsoft does not guarantee that
they can be used in all situations. While Microsoft Product Support
Services (PSS) Engineers can help explain the functionality of a
particular macro, they will not modify these examples to provide added
functionality, nor will they help you construct macros to meet your
specific needs. If you have limited programming experience, you may want
to consult one of the Microsoft Solution Providers. Solution Providers
offer a wide range of fee-based services, including creating custom
macros. For more information about Microsoft Solution Providers, call
Microsoft Customer Information Service at (800) 426-9400.
<P>
NOTE: This macro utilizes the Northwind.mdb sample database that is
installed with Microsoft Office Professional, versions 7.0 and 97. If you
accepted the default options when you installed Office 7.0, the file is
located in the C:\MSOffice\Access\Samples folder. If you accepted the
default options when you installed Office 97, this file is located in the
C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\Samples folder. If your
Northwind database is located in a different folder, you must edit the
code provided before you attempt to run it.
<P>
To use DAO with a Visual Basic for Applications macro, you must reference
the DAO Object library. With a module sheet active, click References on
the Tools menu. If you are using Microsoft Excel 97, select the
"Microsoft DAO 3.5 Object Library" check box in the Available References
list and click OK. If you are using Microsoft Excel 7.0, select the
"Microsoft DAO 3.0 Object Library" check box in the Available References
list and click OK.
<P>

  'This sub will pass two parameters to QueryDef in the Northwind
  'database and place the results on Sheet1. The parameters are hard
  'coded in, but you can get the parameters set in any number of ways,
  'from an InputBox to placing the parameters in specific cells on a
  'worksheet.

  'row starting at "A1."

  'it into the Worksheet (Sheet1).
