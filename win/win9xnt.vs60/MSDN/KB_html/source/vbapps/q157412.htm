The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run a Visual Basic for Applications macro that uses the Select
method to select a specific range of cells in Microsoft Excel 97, the macro
may select a larger range of cells than you specified.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may occur when you run a macro that uses the Select method to
select a range of cells and performs an action on the selected cells.
<P>
If you programmatically select a merged cell in a range, the selection may
be enlarged such that it encompasses the columns and/or rows that are
occupied by the merged cell. For example, if the range A2:C2 is merged, the
following statement selects cells A1:C10 and not A1:A10 as you might
expect:
<P>
<PRE>   ActiveSheet.Range("A1:A10").Select

</PRE>The selection is expanded to include B1:C10 because range A1:A10 contains a
merged cell that extends into cells in columns B and C.
<P>
NOTE: In this scenario in Microsoft Excel 97, you cannot select only cells
A1:A10 with the mouse. Microsoft Excel automatically extends the selection
to include cells B1:C10 because the range A2:C2 is merged.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>

Microsoft provides examples of Visual Basic for Applications procedures for
illustration only, without warranty either expressed or implied, including,
but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and/or fitness
for a particular purpose. The Visual Basic procedures in this article are
provided 'as is' and Microsoft does not guarantee that they can be used in
all situations. While Microsoft support engineers can help explain the
functionality of a particular macro, they will not modify these examples to
provide added functionality, nor will they help you construct macros to
meet your specific needs. If you have limited programming experience, you
may want to consult one of the Microsoft Solution Providers. Solution
Providers offer a wide range of fee-based services, including creating
custom macros. For more information about Microsoft Solution Providers,
call Microsoft Customer Information Service at (800) 426-9400.
<P>
To work around this behavior, use one of the following methods.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1</h3>
 
<P>
Apply the property or method to specific a Range object rather than the
Selection object if the selection contains merged cells that span cells
outside of that specified range.
<P>
For example, the following macro selects cells A1:A10 and applies a bold
font format to the selection:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub FormatCells()

      ActiveSheet.Range("A1:A10").Select
      Selection.Font.Bold = True

   End Sub

</PRE>If cells A2:C2 are merged, this macro applies a bold font format to the
cells A1:C10. If you wish to limit the application of the bold font format
to cells A1:A10, use the following macro instead. The following example
applies a bold font format to the specific Range object:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub FormatCells()

       ActiveSheet.Range("A1:A10").Font.Bold = True

   End Sub

</PRE><h3>Method 2</h3>
 
<P>
Another alternative is to check whether merged cells exist in the range
prior to performing an action. The following macro determines if there are
any merged cells in the range A1:A10 prior to formatting the cells:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub FormatCells()

       ActiveSheet.Range("A1:A10").Select

       'Apply Bold to the selection if it does not contain merged cells.
       If Not(Selection.MergeCells = True) Then
           Selection.Font.Bold = True
       End If

   End Sub

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design in Microsoft Excel 97.
