<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multiuser skills.
<P>
Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition Tools does not provide a way to
create a shortcut outside of the application's program group. This article
demonstrates how to create a shortcut on the desktop using Visual Basic for
Applications and batch (*.bat) files.
<P>
This article assumes that you are familiar with Visual Basic for
Applications, the Microsoft Office Developers Edition Setup Wizard, and
with creating Microsoft Access applications using the programming tools
provided with Microsoft Access. For more information about Visual Basic for
Applications, please refer to the "Building Applications with Microsoft
Access 97" manual.
<P>

procedures. Microsoft support engineers can help explain the functionality
of a particular procedure, but they will not modify these examples to
provide added functionality or construct procedures to meet your specific
needs. If you have limited programming experience, you may want to contact

</PRE>This example uses or creates the following files:
<P>
<PRE>Script.bat         Script.bat is copied to the folder where Windows runs
                   and is started at the end of setup. Script.bat runs
                   Copyshortcut.mdb and waits until it has completed its
                   work before running Cleanup.bat.

CopyShortcut.mdb   CopyShortcut.mdb contains code that copies a shortcut
                   from its location in the application's program group
                   to the computer's desktop. It also creates Cleanup.bat
                   on the user's computer.

Cleanup.bat        Cleanup.bat first deletes Script.bat and
                   CopyShortcut.mdb, which are no longer needed after the
                   shortcut on the desktop has been created. Cleanup.bat
                   then deletes itself.

</PRE>NOTE: On Microsoft Windows NT, the Command window created by Script.bat
closes, while on Microsoft Windows 95 it remains open and must be closed by
the user.
<P>
The following steps demonstrate how to create the additional files
discussed above and how to distribute them with the sample Northwind
(Northwind.mdb) database using the Microsoft Office Developer Edition Tools
Setup Wizard:

<P>
</OL><h3>Creating a Run-Time Distribution</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>  1. Run the Microsoft Office 97 Developers Edition Tools Setup Wizard.

  2. Select "Create a new set of setup options for my application's
     custom Setup Program", and then click Next.

  3. Add the following files to the List Of Files window. Make sure to
     correctly set File Properties for each file you add.

       CopyShortcut.mdb
       ----------------
       Destination Folder: $(WinPath)

       Script.bat
       ----------
       Destination Folder: $(WinPath)

       Northwind.mdb
       -------------
       Destination Folder: $(AppPath)
       Set As Application's Main File: Checked

     After you've added these files, click Next.

  4. Click Add to include a shortcut to run Northwind.mdb:

       Shortcut for Northwind.mdb
       --------------------------
       General Shortcut Properties
            Description: Northwind
       Database Shortcut Properties
            Database Command-Line Options: Run-time

     Click Next twice to bypass the Registry Values screen, and respond
     to any prompts from the Setup Wizard.

  5. Make sure the following components are being included in your
     run-time distribution, and then click Next twice to bypass the next
     screen.

       Microsoft Access Run-Time Version
       Workgroup Administrator

  6. Name the application Northwind, and then click Next.

  7. In the "Run the following file after the custom Setup program is
     completed:" box, select Script.bat.

  8. In "Enter or edit the command line that will be used to run the
     executable file," type the following:

       "$(FilePath)\Script.bat"

  9. Select "Allow Setup to Complete Before the File Finishes Running,"
     then click Next.

 10. Follow instructions from the Setup Wizard and complete building your
     run-time distribution.

</PRE></OL>When you run setup from either Disk 1 of your disk set or the "Net"
Network/CD setup folder, a shortcut should be created on your desktop.
<P>
NOTE: The process described in this article only functions during the
initial setup of the application. Running setup in maintenance mode will
not cause a shortcut to be created. If it is necessary to do so, you should
uninstall and then reinstall the run-time application.
