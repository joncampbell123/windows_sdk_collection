<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0c
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, when you use the Fourier Analysis tool, provided
in the Analysis ToolPak add-in, to transform data in a worksheet, and
you then use the Fourier Analysis tool again and you use values previously
returned by this function as the new input range values, you receive
the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Fourier Analysis - All complex numbers must have the same suffix, either
   "i" or "j".

</PRE>This behavior does not occur in Microsoft Excel version 4.0.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs because any non-imaginary number that is
returned by the Fourier Analysis tool is formatted as a text value
instead of number value. Because the Input Range value used in the
Fourier Analysis tool must be formatted as a number, the error
message appears when you use this returned value as an input value in
the Fourier Analysis tool.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
To avoid receiving this error message, do either of the following before
using the Fourier Analysis tool using an input data range that has been
returned by the Fourier Analysis tool:

<UL><LI>Use the Paste Special dialog box to convert the values to numbers
   instead of text by doing the following:
<P>
   1. In a blank cell, type "1" (without the quotation marks).
<P>
   2. Select the cell containing the 1, and choose Copy from the Edit
<P><PRE>      menu.
</PRE><P>
   3. Select the range that contains the values that have been returned
<P><PRE>      by the Fourier Analysis tool.
</PRE><P>
   4. From the Edit menu, choose Paste Special.
<P>
   5. In the Paste Special dialog box, under Paste, select Values, and
<P><PRE>      under Operation, choose Multiply. Choose OK.
</PRE><P>
   -or-

<LI>Use the following macro to enter each of the numbers in the selection
   as a number value instead of a text value:
<P>
<PRE>      Sub Enter_Value()
      Dim xCell As Object
         For Each xCell In Selection
             xCell.Value = xCell.Value
         Next xCell
      End Sub
