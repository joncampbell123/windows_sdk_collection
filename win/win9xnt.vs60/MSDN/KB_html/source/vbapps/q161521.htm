<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you create a project with multiple UserForms, you can use
CommandButtons to move between the UserForms. This article explains how to
create two UserForms and includes a sample Visual Basic for Applications
macro that moves between the UserForms.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>

<P><h3>Creating the UserForms</h3>
 
<P>
To create the UserForms, use the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Save and close any open workbooks, and then create a new workbook.

<P><LI>Start the Visual Basic Editor (press ALT+F11).

<P><LI>On the Insert menu, click UserForm.
<P>
</OL>This step inserts UserForm1 into the project.

<OL><P><LI>Add a TextBox and a CommandButton control to the UserForm.

<P><LI>Change the Caption property of the CommandButton to "show UserForm2"
   (without the quotation marks).

<P><LI>On the Insert menu, click UserForm.
<P>
</OL>This step inserts UserForm2 into the project.

<OL><P><LI>Add a TextBox and a CommandButton control to the UserForm.

<P><LI>Change the Caption property of the CommandButton to "show UserForm1"
   (without the quotation marks).
<P>
</OL><h3>Sample Macro for Moving Between UserForms</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Double-click the CommandButton on UserForm1.

<P><LI>Type the following code for the CommandButton1 Click event:
<P>
       Private Sub CommandButton1_Click()
<P>
<PRE>           'Set the text for TextBox1 in UserForm2 with the text in
           'TextBox1 in UserForm1.
           UserForm2.TextBox1.Text = TextBox1.Text

           UserForm1.Hide
           UserForm2.Show
       End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>Double-click the CommandButton on UserForm2.

<P><LI>Type the following code for the CommandButton1 Click event:
<P>
       Private Sub CommandButton1_Click()
<P>
<PRE>           'Set the text for the TextBox in UserForm1.
           UserForm1.TextBox1.Text = TextBox1.Text

           UserForm2.Hide
           UserForm1.Show
       End Sub

</PRE></OL>NOTE: Because the CommandButton and TextBox controls are on different
UserForms, you can use the same name for the controls.

<OL><P><LI>On the Insert menu, click Module.

<P><LI>Type the following code in this module:
<P>
<PRE>       Sub Show_UserForms()
           UserForm1.Show
       End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>Run the Show_UserForms macro.

<P><LI>Type any text in the TextBox on UserForm1, and then click the
    CommandButton.
<P>
</OL>UserForm1 is hidden. UserForm2 is displayed with the text you typed in
the TextBox on UserForm1.

<OL><P><LI>Type new text in the TextBox on UserForm2, and then click the
    CommandButton.
<P>
</OL>UserForm2 is hidden. UserForm1 is displayed with the text you typed in
the TextBox on UserForm2.

<OL><P><LI>Close the UserForm.
