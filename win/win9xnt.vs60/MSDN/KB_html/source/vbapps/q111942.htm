<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, if you choose Replace from the Edit menu, and you leave
the Find What box blank and choose Find Next, Replace, or Replace All to
fill blank cells on a worksheet, you receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Search string must be specified

</PRE><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, use any of the following methods.
<P>
Method 1: The following method is presented on page 33 in "Microsoft Excel
<PRE>          Visual Basic for Applications Step by Step," a Microsoft Press
          book.

          1. Highlight the range

          2. From the Edit menu, choose Goto

          3. Choose Special

          4. Select the Blanks check box

          5. Choose OK

          All the blanks in the range are now highlighted. Enter the value
          that you want to replace the blanks with. Now press CTRL+ENTER.
          This places the data in all of the selected cells.

          Note that if the worksheet is completely blank, you will receive
          the error message "No Cells Found."

</PRE>Method 2: The following Visual Basic procedure prompts you for the text you
<PRE>          want to enter in blank cells, and replaces the contents of the
          blank cells in the selection with this text.

             Sub Replace_Blanks()
                ' Dimension variables
                Dim Blanks As Object
                Dim ReplaceWith As String
                Dim Cell As Object
                ' Prompt user for string to enter in blank cells
                ReplaceWith = _
                Application.InputBox("Replace blank cells with what?", _
                "Replace String")
                ' Select blank cells in selection
                Selection.SpecialCells(xlBlanks).Select
                ' Defined Blanks as selection
                Set Blanks = Application.Selection
                ' Fill each cell in selection with user input
                For Each cell In blanks
                   Cell.Activate
                   ActiveCell.Formula = replacewith
                Next cell
             End Sub

<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in
Microsoft Excel for Windows version 5.0c.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel versions earlier than version 5.0, you can replace blank
cells with a value by using the Replace dialog box and leaving the Find
What box blank. However, in Microsoft Excel version 5.0, you cannot use
this method to replace blank cells because you cannot leave the Find What
box in the Replace dialog box blank.
