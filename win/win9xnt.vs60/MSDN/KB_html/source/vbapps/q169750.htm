<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Outlook 97, if you programmatically set a Contact's e-mail
address, the e-mail address is not checked (or "resolved") against an
Address Book. Therefore, the Contact's e-mail address is not added to the
Outlook Address Book.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This is a limitation of Outlook 97.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
NOTE: This problem was fixed in Outlook 98. Outlook 98 will resolve the
e-mail address when the item is saved.
<P>
You can use the CommandBars object model to execute the Check Names menu
command and resolve the e-mail address. However, this workaround requires
that you display the Contact window.

</PRE>This example code is designed to run from another Microsoft Office 97
program using Visual Basic for Applications, or from a separate Visual
Basic (VB) application. In order to use this code you must reference the
"Microsoft Outlook 8.0 Object Library" from within the editor. Consult your
editor's documentation for how to reference available object libraries.
<P>
The following Outlook automation code is an example of how to workaround
this issue:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub ResolveContactAddressViaCheckNames()
      Dim ol As Outlook.Application
      Dim olns As NameSpace
      Dim myContact As Object
      Dim Menu as Object
      Dim Command As Object
      Set ol = New Outlook.Application
      Set olns = ol.GetNamespace("MAPI")
      ' Create a new Contact item
      Set myContact = olns.GetDefaultFolder(olFolderContacts).Items.Add
      With myContact
         ' Set the relevant fields for the contact
         .FullName = "John Smith"
         .Email1Address = "jsmith@msn.com"
         .Email1AddressType = "SMTP"
         ' Display the contact (required)
         .Display
      End With
      ' Set the Tools menu on the item's menu bar
      Set Menu = ol.ActiveInspector.CommandBars("Tools")
      ' Sets the command on the menu
      Set Command = Menu.Controls("Check Names")
      ' Actually executes the Check Names command
      Command.Execute
   End Sub
