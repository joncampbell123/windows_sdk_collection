The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access 1.0, 1.1, 2.0, 7.0, 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
When you save a table after you add a new field or change the properties
of an existing field, you receive the message "Too many fields defined,"
followed by the message "Errors were encountered during save. Data types
were not changed." You receive these messages even though you have 255 or
fewer fields defined in the table.
<P>
NOTE: You also receive this message if you add or modify fields in a report
that is based on a table that has too many fields.
<P>
NOTE: This error message generates the Microsoft Jet Database Engine 3.0
Reserved Error number 3190.
<P>
This article assumes that you are familiar with Visual Basic for
Applications and with creating Microsoft Access applications using the
programming tools provided with Microsoft Access. For more information
about Visual Basic for Applications, please refer to your version of the
"Building Applications with Microsoft Access" manual.
<P>
NOTE: Visual Basic for Applications is called Access Basic in Microsoft
Access versions 1.x and 2.0. For more information about Access Basic,
please refer to the "Introduction to Programming" manual in Microsoft
Access version 1.x or the "Building Applications" manual in Microsoft
Access version 2.0
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The internal column count Microsoft Access uses to track the number of
fields in the table has reached 255. Microsoft Access does not change the
internal column count when you delete a field. Microsoft Access also
creates a new field (increasing the internal column count by 1) for every
field whose properties you modify.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To free the internal column count for deleted fields or for fields whose
properties you modify do one of the following:
<P>
<PRE>    In Microsoft Access 7.0 or 97, click Save As/Export on the File
    menu and save the table under a different name. Rename the new table
    after you delete the original table.

    In Microsoft Access 1.x or 2.0, click Save As on the File menu
    and save the table under a different name. Rename the new table
    after you delete the original table.

</PRE>WARNING: Clicking Save As on the File menu in version 1.x or 2.0
copies only the structure of a table, not the records. Do not delete
the original table until you use an append query to populate the new
table.
<P>
You can also free the internal column count by compacting the database.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Access, you can define up to 255 fields in a table. If you
create 255 fields and then delete 10, Microsoft Access does not release
the fields from the internal column count. Also, for every field whose
properties you modify, Microsoft Access creates a new field and does not
release the original field from the internal column count.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 
<P>
NOTE: For Microsoft Access version 1.x, manually create a table with
255 fields, all with a data type of Text. The code below works only for
Microsoft Access 2.0 and later.

<OL><P><LI>Create the following Visual Basic for Applications code to
   create a new table with 255 fields:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ' ****************************************************************
      ' Declarations section of the module
      ' ****************************************************************
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      Option Compare Database
      Option Explicit
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      ' ****************************************************************
      ' The Fill_Table() function creates a table in the current database
      ' named Field Test with 255 fields, each of which has a Text data
      ' type and a size of one character.
      ' ****************************************************************
      Function Fill_Table ()
<PRE></PRE>         Dim mydb As Database
         Dim tbl As TableDef
         Dim fld As Field
         Dim i As Integer
         Set mydb = CurrentDb()
         Set tbl = mydb.CreateTableDef("Field Test")
         For i = 0 To 254
            Set fld = tbl.CreateField("Field" &amp; CStr(i + 1))
            fld.type = DB_TEXT
            fld.size = 1
            tbl.fields.Append fld
         Next i
         mydb.tabledefs.Append tbl
      End Function

</PRE><P><LI>Type the following line in the Debug window (or Immediate window in
   version 2.0) to run the function and create the table:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ? Fill_Table()
</PRE>
<P><LI>View the table Field Test in Design view, and delete the last field
   so that there are only 254 fields defined in the table.

<P><LI>Add the field again, and attempt to save the table.
<P>
   In Microsoft Access 97, you see the following error messages:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Too many fields defined.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      Errors were encountered during the save operation. Fields were
      not added. Properties were not updated.
</PRE><P>
   In Microsoft Access 7.0, you see the following error messages:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Too many fields defined
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      Fields were not added. Properties were not updated.
</PRE><P>
   In Microsoft Access versions 1.x and 2.0, you see the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Too many fields defined
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      Errors were encountered during save. Data types were not changed.
