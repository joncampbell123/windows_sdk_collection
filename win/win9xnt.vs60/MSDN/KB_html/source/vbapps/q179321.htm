<P>
Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multiuser skills.
<P>
This article demonstrates a sample user-defined Visual Basic for
Applications procedure you can use to set different paper tray sources for
the pages of a report using the PrtDevMode property.
<P>

language being demonstrated and the tools used to create and debug
procedures. Microsoft support engineers can help explain the functionality
of a particular procedure, but they will not modify these examples to
provide added functionality or construct procedures to meet your specific
needs. If you have limited programming experience, you may want to contact

</PRE>When you use the PrtDevMode property, keep the following printer driver
characteristics in mind:

<UL><LI>Set only those members that the printer driver supports. For example,
   if you set a custom page size for a driver that does not support a
   custom page size, you may encounter unexpected results.

<LI>Set the PrtDevMode property's Fields member if you change any other
   member to let the printer driver know which members you are changing.

<LI>Change only the first 68 bytes of the PrtDevMode property. Printer
   drivers are able to store driver-specific information after the first
   68 bytes; therefore, it is important not to overwrite this information.
<P>
</UL>This article assumes that you want to print the first page of your report
from one paper source and the second page of your report from another paper
source.

   and then press ENTER:
<P>
<P><PRE>      setPaperSource("Invoice")
</PRE><P>
   Note that the first two pages of the Invoice report prints. The first
   page prints from the lower tray and the second page prints from the
   upper tray.
