The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access versions 7.0, 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multiuser skills.
<P>
When you maximize a form, all other forms that are open are also
maximized. You cannot maximize one form independent of the other open
forms.
<P>
This article assumes that you are familiar with Visual Basic for
Applications and with creating Microsoft Access applications using the
programming tools provided with Microsoft Access. For more information
about Visual Basic for Applications, please refer to your version of
the "Building Applications with Microsoft Access" manual.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Access is a multiple document interface (MDI) application.
The default behavior for an MDI document is for all child windows to
be maximized when one is maximized. This behavior occurs in many
applications. For example, if you maximize one group window in Windows
Program Manager, any other group window that you select (using the Window
menu) will also be maximized. Or, if you maximize a document window in
Microsoft Word for Windows, all other document windows will be maximized
as well.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
There are several ways to work around this behavior:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access 97 introduces the MinMaxButtons Property. Setting
   this property in Microsoft Access 97 prevents users from Minimizing
   or Maximizing the form. This means the default state of the form is
   maintained when the focus is shifted to the form.
<P>
   The following suggestions work in both Microsoft Access 7.0 and 97

<LI>Set the form's PopUp property to Yes. Forms whose PopUp property is
   set to Yes are not MDI child windows. Pop-up forms float on top of
   other forms, and are not maximized when an MDI child window is
   maximized.

<LI>You can simulate maximizing a form by sizing it as large as possible
   in a restored state. The following example demonstrates how to create
   and use a sample Sub procedure called MaximizeRestoredForm to restore
   a form if it is maximized, and then to move the form to the upper-left
   corner of the Microsoft Access client area window and size it as large
   as possible.

</UL><OL><P><LI>Create a module and type the following lines in the Declarations
   section:

      End Type

      Const SW_SHOWNORMAL = 1

</PRE><P><LI>Type the following procedure:
<P>
<PRE>      Sub MaximizeRestoredForm(F As Form)
         Dim MDIRect As RECT
         Dim RetVal As Long

         ' If the form is maximized, restore it.
         If IsZoomed(F.Hwnd) &lt;&gt; 0 Then
            RetVal = ShowWindow(F.Hwnd, SW_SHOWNORMAL)
         End If

         ' Get the screen coordinates and window size of the
         ' MDIClient window.
         RetVal = GetWindowRect(GetParent(F.Hwnd), MDIRect)

         ' Move the form to the upper-left corner of the MDIClient
         ' window (0,0) and size it to the same size as the
         ' MDIClient window.
         RetVal = MoveWindow(F.Hwnd, 0, 0, MDIRect.Right - _
            MDIRect.Left - 4, MDIRect.Bottom - MDIRect.Top - 4, True)
      End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>To test this function, open the Customers form, type the following
   line in the Debug window, and then press ENTER.
<P>
<P><PRE>      MaximizeRestoredForm form_Customers
</PRE><P>
   Note that the Customers form is resized to cover the entire client
   area of the Microsoft Access Window.
