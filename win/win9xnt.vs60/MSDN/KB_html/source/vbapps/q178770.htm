<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition, if you run a Microsoft Visual 
Basic for Applications macro or procedure that checks the BottomRightCell 
property or TopLeftCell property of a drawing object, AutoShape, chart, or 
other object, the address of the cell may appear to be incorrect. 
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs if the BottomRightCell or TopLeftCell returns the
address of a merged cell.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft provides programming examples for illustration only, without
warranty either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the
implied warranties of merchantability and/or fitness for a particular
purpose. This article assumes that you are familiar with the programming
language being demonstrated and the tools used to create and debug
procedures. Microsoft support engineers can help explain the functionality
of a particular procedure, but they will not modify these examples to
provide added functionality or construct procedures to meet your specific
needs. If you have limited programming experience, you may want to contact
the Microsoft fee-based consulting line at (800) 936-5200. For more
information about the support options available from Microsoft, please see
the following page on the World Wide Web:
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/support/supportnet/refguide/default.asp">http://www.microsoft.com/support/supportnet/refguide/default.asp</A></B>

</PRE>If you want to return the address of the merged cell that lies beneath the
upper-left corner or the lower-right corner of an object, modify the code
so that it checks the address of the upper-leftmost cell of the MergeArea
that lies beneath the object. For example, instead of using the following
code:
<P>
<PRE>   X = ActiveSheet.Shapes(1).TopLeftCell.Address

</PRE>use this code:
<P>
<PRE>   X = ActiveSheet.Shapes(1).TopLeftCell.MergeArea.Resize(1, 1).Address

</PRE>The MergeArea property returns the entire range of cells that is merged
into a single cell. The Resize method returns the upper-leftmost cell of
the MergeArea. The Address property returns the address of the merged cell.
<P>
You can use the same process with the BottomRightCell property of objects.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you check the BottomRightCell property or the TopLeftCell property of
an object in Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition, the property does not 
recognize that the worksheet may contain merged cells. As a result, each 
property returns the address of the cell that would have been under the 
upper-left or lower-right corner of the object if the cells had not been 
merged.
