<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, when you run a macro that you recorded while you
inserted a map object on your worksheet, you may receive one of the
following error messages:
<P>
<PRE>   Run-time error '1004':

   DrawingObjects method of Worksheet class failed.

   -or-

   Run-time error '1000':

   Range does not have writeable Width property

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs because when you turn on the macro recorder and insert
a map object, the incorrect commands are recorded. If you do not record the
action of entering the data on the worksheet and then creating the map from
this data, you receive the run-time error '1004' when you run the macro
because the recorded macro contains a line similar to the following:
<P>
<PRE>   ActiveSheet.DrawingObjects("Marquee 0").Select

</PRE>This line causes the error message because the drawing object Marquee does
not exist when you run the macro.
<P>
If you do record the process of entering the data and then creating the
map, you receive the run-time error '1000' when you run the macro because
the recorded macro contains lines similar to the following:
<P>
<PRE>   Selection.Width = 184.5
   Selection.Height = 156

</PRE>When you run the macro, the first of these lines returns the error message
because the Width property of the Range object is a Read Only property, and
a range of cells is selected when this command runs.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, you can modify your recorded macro to appear
similar to the following example:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub Create_Map()
      ' Select the range on the worksheet that contains the
      ' data that you want to use to create the map
      Range("A1:B5").Select
      ActiveSheet.OLEObjects.Add(ClassType:="MSDataMap.1").Activate
   End Sub

</PRE>Note that this procedure creates a map object on top of the data on the
worksheet. If there are multiple maps available for the data that you use
to create the map, the Multiple Maps Available dialog box appears when you
run this macro, and you must select a map in order for the macro to
continue.
