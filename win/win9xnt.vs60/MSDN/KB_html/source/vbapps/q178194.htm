<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use a Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications macro (Sub
procedure) to transfer an array of dates to a worksheet, the day and month
may be transposed.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may occur when the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>The Short date style, set on the Date tab of the Regional Settings in
   Control Panel, is set to dd-MMM-yy.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -and-
</PRE>
<LI>You stored a date in a variant array.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -and-
</PRE>
<LI>You placed the array in a worksheet.
<P>
</UL><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>

</PRE>You can avoid this problem by using the CLng function to convert the date
to a long integer before placing it into a worksheet, as the following
sample macro demonstrates:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub EnterDate()

      Dim vDate() As Variant
      ReDim vDate(1) As Variant

      vDate(0) = DateSerial(1997, 1, 12)   ' This is January 12, 1997
      vDate(1) = DateSerial(1997, 10, 1)   ' This is October 1, 1997

      ' Loop through each element of the array vDate.
      For i = LBound(vDate) To UBound(vDate)
         ' The CLng function is used below to convert the date to long.
         vDate(i) = CLng(vDate(i))
      Next i

      ' Place the array contents into cells A1:B1.
      Range("A1:B1").Value = vDate

      ' Change the cell format so the date is easier to read.
      Range("A1:B1").NumberFormat = "mmmm d, yyyy"

   End Sub

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
