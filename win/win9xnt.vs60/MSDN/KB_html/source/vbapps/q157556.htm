<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 97, if you use a Visual Basic for Applications macro to
remove the border line from a drawing object or AutoShape, one of the
following problems may occur:

<UL><LI>The interior of the object may change color, switch to a different
   pattern, or turn completely transparent.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>You may receive the following error message
<P>
<P><PRE>      Run-time error '1004':
      Unable to set the LineStyle property of the Border class
</PRE><P>
   and your macro halts.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
These problems may occur if you try to use either of the following lines of
code to remove the border line from a drawing object, such as a rectangle
or an oval:
<P>
<PRE>   Selection.Border.LineStyle = xlNone

   -or-

   Selection.Border.LineStyle = xlLineStyleNone

</PRE><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft provides examples of Visual Basic for Applications procedures for

provided 'as is' and Microsoft does not guarantee that they can be used in
all situations. While Microsoft support engineers can help explain the
functionality of a particular macro, they will not modify these examples to
provide added functionality, nor will they help you construct macros to
meet your specific needs. If you have limited programming experience, you
may want to consult one of the Microsoft Solution Providers. Solution
Providers offer a wide range of fee-based services, including creating
custom macros. For more information about Microsoft Solution Providers,

<P>
In Microsoft Excel 97, use the following line of code if you want to remove
the border line from a drawing object:
<P>
<PRE>   Selection.ShapeRange.Line.Visible = msoFalse

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design of Microsoft Excel 97.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 97, drawing objects such as rectangles, ovals, and
freehand objects can be filled with a variety of effects, including solid
colors, gradient fills, patterns, textures, and pictures.
<P>
If you run either of the commands shown above, the commands may not work
correctly. The results you get depend on the type of fill applied to the
object whose line is being removed as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   Fill Type     Results
   ------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Solid Color   The line is removed correctly.

   Gradient      You receive the "Run-time error '1004'" error message
                 shown above, and the line is NOT removed.

   Pattern       The line is removed correctly, but the pattern may be
                 replaced by another, different pattern.

   Texture       The line is removed correctly, but the texture fill is
                 removed and replaced with a solid white fill.

   Picture       The line is removed correctly, but the picture fill is
                 removed completely, so that the object is now transparent.

</PRE>To avoid these problems, use the line of code shown in the Workaround
section whenever you want to remove the border line from a drawing object.
