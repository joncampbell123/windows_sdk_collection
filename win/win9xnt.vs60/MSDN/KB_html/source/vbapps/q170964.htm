<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When concatenating large strings on the order of 50kb or larger (for
example, building an HTML table from a database), the length of time to
complete can become quite long as the string gets larger. This article
demonstrates an alternative to normal concatenation that can improve
performance for large strings by 20 times or more.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When performing repeated concatenations of the type:
<P>
<PRE>   For I = 1 To N
     Dest = Dest &amp; Source
   Next N

</PRE>the length of time increases proportionally to N-squared. Thus, 1000
iterations will take about 100 times longer than 100 iterations. This is
because Visual Basic does not just add the Source characters to the end of
the Dest string; it also performs the following operations:

<OL><P><LI>Allocates temporary memory large enough to hold the result.

<P><LI>Copies Dest to the start of the temporary area.

<P><LI>Copies Source to the end of the temporary area.

<P><LI>De-allocates the old copy of Dest.

<P><LI>Allocates memory for Dest large enough to hold the result.

<P><LI>Copies the temporary data to Dest.
<P>
</OL>Steps 2 and 6 are very expensive and basically result in the entire
concatenated result being copied twice with additional overhead to allocate
and de-allocate memory.
<P>
This article details a method using the Mid$ statement and pre-allocating
memory in larger chunks to eliminate all but step 3 above for most of the
concatenation phase.

       1000 concatenations took 2348 ticks
       2000 concatenations took 8954 ticks
       3000 concatenations took 20271 ticks
       4000 concatenations took 35103 ticks
       5000 concatenations took 54453 ticks
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      Using pre-allocated storage and pseudo-concatenation
       1000 pseudo-concatenations took 82 ticks
       2000 pseudo-concatenations took 124 ticks
       3000 pseudo-concatenations took 165 ticks
       4000 pseudo-concatenations took 247 ticks
       5000 pseudo-concatenations took 289 ticks
</PRE><P>
</OL><h3>Additional Information</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>The code may take a couple of minutes to run.

<P><LI>GetTickCount returns the number of milliseconds since Windows
   was started. Thus, the output is in milliseconds.

<P><LI>Performance improvement ranges from almost 30 times for the
   1000-iteration case to almost 200 times for the 5000-iteration case.
   These times may vary depending on:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - The product used.
    - Your system configuration..
    - The size of ccIncrement (larger size favors MidConcat).
    - The number of iterations used (more iterations favors MidConcat).
    - The size of the resultant string (larger size favors MidConcat).
