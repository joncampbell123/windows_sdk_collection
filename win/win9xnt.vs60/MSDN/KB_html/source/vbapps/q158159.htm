The information in this article applies to:
<P>

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, version 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0
<LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows, version 8.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The most recently used file list located on the File menu is unavailable.
After you enable the Recently Used File List option in the Options dialog
box and restart Microsoft Excel, the recently used file list is still
unavailable.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Most Recently Used (MRU) list of files list located on the File menu
will be unavailable after installing the Microsoft Excel Virus Search 1.2
Add-In, Xlscan.xla. The Recent File List is unavailable to prevent the
spreading of viruses. After you install the Virus Search add-in, all
workbooks and workbook templates that you open by clicking Open on the File
menu or by clicking the Open button on the Standard toolbar are checked
automatically for macros.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To make the most recently used file list available on the File menu, do the
following:

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Options.

<P><LI>Click the General tab.

<P><LI>Select the Recently Used File List option.

<P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
</OL>This is a temporary solution, because the Recently Used File List is
unavailable when you restart Microsoft Excel. This setting can be
automatically turned on through a Visual Basic for Applications macro.
<P>
Microsoft provides examples of Visual Basic for Applications procedures for

but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and/or fitness
for a particular purpose. The Visual Basic procedures in this article are
provided 'as is' and Microsoft does not guarantee that they can be used in
all situations. While Microsoft support engineers can help explain the
functionality of a particular macro, they will not modify these examples to
provide added functionality, nor will they help you construct macros to
meet your specific needs. If you have limited programming experience, you
may want to consult one of the Microsoft Solution Providers. Solution
Providers offer a wide range of fee-based services, including creating
custom macros. For more information about Microsoft Solution Providers,
call Microsoft Customer Information Service at (800) 426-9400.
<P>
The following macro will turn on the Recently Used File List.
<P>
<PRE>   Sub Auto_Open()
       Application.DisplayRecentFiles = True
   End Sub

</PRE></OL>Enter the macro code on a module sheet. For the macro to open every time
you start Microsoft Excel, put this macro in the Personal.xls file which is
saved in the "C:\MSOffice\Excel\XLStart" folder. The location of the
XLStart folder may be different depending on what you chose during setup.
<P>
NOTE: If you open a workbook from the Microsoft Excel Recent File List,
Windows File Manager, Windows Explorer, an electronic mail message, or from
a Web browser (such as the Microsoft Internet Explorer), the workbook is
not checked automatically for macros that might contain viruses. If you
open workbooks in any of these ways, or if you decide to open a workbook
with macros, you can check these workbooks as follows and remove the Laroux
virus before you save the workbooks or pass the virus on to other
workbooks.
<P>
To clear the virus from open workbooks:

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Virus Search.

<P><LI>Click Yes when you are prompted to search for the virus.

<P><LI>Select Currently Open Workbooks and then click OK.

<P><LI>If the Virus Search add-in reports that the Laroux virus was found and
   removed from a workbook, it prompts you to save the workbook. Click Yes,
   so that the clean copy of the workbook replaces the infected copy on
   your disk.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Excel Virus Search 1.2 Add-In, Xlscan.xla, is a tool that
protects you against the ExcelMacro/Laroux macro virus and will help
identify other macro viruses.
<P>
The Microsoft Excel ExcelMacro/Laroux macro is a nonharmful, nondestructive
concept virus that appends a module sheet named "Laroux" to a workbook. It
does not harm data or files in any way. This is the first replicating macro
virus ever discovered in Microsoft Excel. The virus only affects workbooks
created in Microsoft Excel version 5.0 for Windows, Microsoft Excel version
5.0 for Windows NT, and Microsoft Excel 7.0 for Windows 95 and Windows NT,
including certain localized versions of Microsoft Excel (for example,
versions of Microsoft Excel translated to German). This virus does not
affect earlier versions of Microsoft Excel for Windows and it does not
affect any version of Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh.
