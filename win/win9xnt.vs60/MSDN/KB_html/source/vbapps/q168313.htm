The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multiuser skills.
<P>
When you use data access objects (DAO) to retrieve properties for linked
TableDef objects, the process is much slower than when you use DAO to
retrieve the properties  for local Tabledef objects.
<P>
This article assumes that you are familiar with Visual Basic for
Applications and with creating Microsoft Access applications using the
programming tools provided with Microsoft Access. For more information
about Visual Basic for Applications, please refer to the "Building
Applications with Microsoft Access 97" manual.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Jet database engine must create a temporary query for each
property retrieval of a linked TableDef object. The Jet database engine
does not need to do this when retrieving properties for local TableDef
objects.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Instead of retrieving the properties for the linked TableDef objects in
the current database, you can use DAO to open the database that the
TableDef objects actually reside in, and then retrieve the properties. To
accomplish this, follow steps 1 - 17 in the "Steps to Reproduce Behavior"
section later in this article and substitute the following procedure for
the procedure documented in step 15:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub EnumProperties(tDefName As String)
       Dim db As Database
       Dim tDef As TableDef
       Dim tDefSourceTableName As String
       Dim tDefProperty As Property
       Dim PropCount As Integer
       Dim dbPath As String
       Dim tDefField As Field
       Dim StartTime As Date, EndTime As Date

       StartTime = Now
       Set db = CurrentDb
       Set tDef = db.TableDefs(tDefName)

       If (tDef.Attributes And dbAttachedTable) &lt;&gt; 0 Then
           If InStr(tDef.Connect, ".mdb") &gt; 0 Then
               tDefSourceTableName = tDef.SourceTableName
               dbPath = Right$(tDef.Connect, _
                        Len(tDef.Connect) - _
                        InStr(tDef.Connect, "="))
               Set db = DBEngine(0).OpenDatabase(dbPath)
               Set tDef = db.TableDefs(tDefSourceTableName)
           End If
       End If

       For Each tDefProperty In tDef.Properties
       Next

       For Each tDefField In tDef.Fields
           For Each tDefProperty In tDefField.Properties
               PropCount = PropCount + 1
           Next
       Next

       EndTime = Now
       Debug.Print
       Debug.Print "Table: " &amp; tDef.Name
       Debug.Print "Number of Table and Field Properties: " &amp; _
          tDef.Properties.Count + PropCount
       Debug.Print "Total Time: " &amp; _
          DateDiff("s", StartTime, EndTime) &amp; " second(s)"
       db.Close
   End Sub

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>

<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 
<P>
CAUTION: Following the steps in this example will modify the sample
database Northwind.mdb. You may want to back up the Northwind.mdb file
and perform these steps on a copy of the database.

<OL><P><LI>Open the sample database Northwind.mdb.

<P><LI>Create a module and type the following line in the Declarations
    section if it is not already there:
<P>
       Option Explicit

<P><LI>Type the following procedure. This procedure adds 700 user-defined
    properties to the Employees table.
<P>
<PRE>       Sub CreateProperties()
          Dim db As Database
          Dim tDef As TableDef
          Dim prop As Property
          Dim i As Integer

          Set db = CurrentDb
          Set tDef = db.TableDefs!Employees
          For i = 1 To 700
             Set prop = tDef.CreateProperty("Prop" &amp; i, dbText, i)
             tDef.Properties.Append prop
          Next
          tDef.Properties.Refresh
          MsgBox "Number of Properties: " &amp; tDef.Properties.Count
          db.Close
       End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>To run this procedure, type the following line in the Debug window,
    and then press ENTER.
<P>
       CreateProperties
<P>
    Note that the message box indicates the number of properties that were
    added to the Employees table. This number will include any existing
    properties as well.

<P><LI>Create a new, blank database named PropTest.mdb.

<P><LI>On the File menu, point to Get External Data, and then click Import.

<P><LI>In the Import dialog box, select Microsoft Access (*.mdb) from the
    Files Of Type list.

<P><LI>Locate your Office97\Office\Samples folder, select Northwind.mdb,
    and then click Import.

<P><LI>In the Import Objects dialog box, select the Employees table, and then
    click OK.

<P><LI>Locate your Samples folder, select Northwind.mdb, and then click Link.

<P><LI>In the Link Tables dialog box, select the Employees table, and then
    click OK. Note that the linked table is named "Employees1."

<P><LI>Create a module and type the following line in the Declarations

           Next

              For Each tDefProperty In tDefField.Properties
                 PropCount = PropCount + 1
              Next
           Next

    amount of time it takes to enumerate its properties. To run this
    procedure, type the following line in the Debug window, and then
    press ENTER.
<P>
       EnumProperties "Employees"
<P>
    Note the number of seconds it takes to enumerate through all
    properties of the Employees table.

<P><LI>Test this procedure with the linked Employees1 table to determine the
    amount of time it takes to enumerate its properties. To run this
    procedure, type the following line in the Debug window, and then
    press ENTER.
<P>
       EnumProperties "Employees1"
<P>
    Note that the number of seconds it takes to enumerate the properties
    of the linked table is much higher.
