The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 5.x
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0
<LI>Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, versions 5.0, 5.0a
</UL>

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Once you open a workbook that sets particular event properties, such as
OnCalculate, all workbooks opened subsequently will run that same
subprocedure.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The event properties are properties of the Application object which means
that they are not workbook specific.
<P>
Once you set these properties, they will hold a reference to the
subprocedure referenced when the property was set. The reference includes
the full path and file name of the Microsoft Excel file, as well as the
subprocedure name.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>

Microsoft provides programming examples for illustration only, without

purpose. This article assumes that you are familiar with the programming 
language being demonstrated and the tools used to create and debug 
procedures. Microsoft support engineers can help explain the functionality 
of a particular procedure, but they will not modify these examples to 
provide added functionality or construct procedures to meet your specific 
needs. If you have limited programming experience, you may want to contact 
the Microsoft fee-based consulting line at (800) 936-5200. For more

<PRE>   <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/support/supportnet/refguide/default.asp">http://www.microsoft.com/support/supportnet/refguide/default.asp</A></B>

</PRE>When you close a workbook, set the event property to an empty string "", as
shown in the following example:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub Auto_Close()
      Application.OnCalculate = ""
   End Sub

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In the case where the workbook that set the event property is closed
but Microsoft Excel remains active, when the event property runs, Microsoft
Excel loads the workbook that contains the subprocedure and runs the
subprocedure.
