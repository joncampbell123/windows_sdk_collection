SUMMARY
 
<P>
In earlier versions of Microsoft Excel, you can use SQLBIND to specify
where the results of a query are placed. However, if you use Data Access
Objects (DAO), and you use the CopyFromRecordset method, data is always
returned to a contiguous section of the worksheet. SQLBIND is not
available with DAO; therefore, you must use alternate method of placing
data in specified columns when you use DAO. This article demonstrates how
to do this.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In order to specify into which columns the results of a data retrieval
are inserted, it is necessary to loop through the recordset, specifying
into which cells to place the data in each iteration of the loop.
<P>

The following subroutine will retrieve the Customers table in the
Northwind database. The subroutine will then place the CustomerID field
in Column A, the CompanyName field in Column C, and the ContactName field
in Column E of Sheet1. The data is placed in the worksheet starting on
the second row so that field headers can be placed in the first row.
<P>
NOTE: This subroutine is designed to run using the Northwind database
that is included with both Microsoft Office 97 for Windows, Professional
Edition and Microsoft Office version 7.0, Professional Edition.
<P>
In Microsoft Office 97 for Windows, Professional Edition, the default
location for the Northwind database is:
<P>
<PRE>   C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\Samples\Northwind.mdb

</PRE>In Microsoft Office version 7.0, Professional Edition, the default
location for the Northwind database is:
<P>
<PRE>   C:\MSOffice\Access\Samples\Northwind.mdb

</PRE>If you installed the Northwind database in a different location, modify
the OpenDatabase statement in the following subroutine. Change the line
to point to the location of the Northwind database.
<P>
<PRE>   Sub Test()
       Dim DB As Database, RS As Recordset
       Dim StartCell As Range

       ' Open the Northwind database.
       Set DB = OpenDatabase("c:\msoffice\access\samples\northwind.mdb")

       ' Open the Customers table as a recordset.
       Set RS = DB.OpenRecordset("Customers")

       ' Set StartCell as the first cell of the return range.
       Set StartCell = Worksheets(1).Range("A2")

       ' Move to the first row of the recordset.
       RS.MoveFirst

       For x = 0 To RS.RecordCount - 1
           With StartCell
               ' Place CustomerName field in column A.
               .Offset(x, 0).Value = RS.Fields("CustomerID").Value

               ' Place CompanyName field in column C.
               .Offset(x, 2).Value = RS.Fields("CompanyName").Value

               ' Place ContactName field in column E.
               .Offset(x, 4).Value = RS.Fields("ContactName").Value
           End With

           ' Move to the next record.
           RS.MoveNext
       Next

       ' Close the Recordset object.
       RS.Close

       ' Close the Database object.
       DB.Close
   End Sub

</PRE>NOTE: If an error appears when you run this subroutine, make sure that
you referenced the DAO Object Library. To reference the library in
Microsoft Excel 97, click References on the Tools menu in the Visual
Basic Editor, and select "Microsoft DAO 3.5 Object Library." To reference
the library in Microsoft Excel version 7.0, activate the module sheet,
click References on the Tools menu, and select "Microsoft DAO 3.0 Object
Library."
