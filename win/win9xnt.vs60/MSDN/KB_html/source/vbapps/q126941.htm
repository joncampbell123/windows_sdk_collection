The information in this article applies to:

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Project, you can use the FilterEdit method in a Visual Basic,
Applications Edition, macro to create a multi-line filter using the
NewFieldName argument in Microsoft Project.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To create this filter, follow the procedure below.
<P>
Microsoft provides examples of Visual Basic procedures for
illustration only, without warranty either expressed or implied,
including but not limited to the implied warranties of
merchantability and/or fitness for a particular purpose. This Visual
Basic procedure is provided 'as is' and Microsoft does not guarantee
that it can be used in all situations. Microsoft does not support
modifications of this procedure to suit customer requirements for a
particular purpose. Note that a line that is preceded by an
apostrophe introduces a comment in the code--comments are provided to
explain what the code is doing at a particular point in the
procedure. Note also that an underscore character (_) indicates that
code continues from one line to the next. You can type lines that
contain this character as one logical line or you can divide the
lines of code and include the line-continuation character.
<P>
<P><h3>Creating the Macro</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>From the Tools menu, choose Macro.

<P><LI>In the Macro Name field, type "MultiLineFilter" (without the quotation
   marks), and then choose OK.

<P><LI>In the Module Editor view, enter the code for the procedure that
   follows, (enter the code exactly as shown):
<P>
<PRE>   Sub MultiLineFilter()

   ' Creates the filter named "MyFilter" or overwrites it if it already
   ' exists. Also adds the first line of the filter. The first line will
   ' read: "ID - grt or equal - 5 - and"

     FilterEdit Name:="MyFilter", TaskFilter:=True, create:=True, _
              overwriteexisting:=True, FieldName:="id", _
              test:="gtr or equal", Value:="5", Operation:="and", _
              ShowInMenu:=True

   ' Creates the second line in the same filter and
   ' will read: "ID - less or equal - 5"

     FilterEdit Name:="MyFilter", TaskFilter:=True, create:=False, _
              overwriteexisting:=False, newfieldname:="id", _
              test:="less or equal", Value:="5"
   End Sub

   NOTE: The "create" and "overwriteexisting" arguments are False. The
   "NewFieldName" parameter specifies the field name of the next available
   line in the filter.

</PRE></OL>If "FieldName" was used instead of "NewFieldName," the first line is
overwritten with the new values since the same field name was used twice.
If a different field had been used along with the "FieldName" parameter,
the line would have been ignored because a line with the same name couldn't
be matched so that the new values could be applied to it.
<P>
By adding additional FilterEdit lines, you can create up to a 20-line
filter.
