<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, the Caller Property Help topic in Microsoft Visual 
Basic for Applications Help contains the following statement:
<P>
<PRE>   If you need to write a macro which behaves differently based on whether
   it is called from a button or a menu item, you should specify an
   argument for the macro in the Assign Macro To Object... dialog box.

</PRE>To help clarify this statement, follow the steps in the "Example" section
in the "More Information" section of this article. These steps show you how
to create a procedure that takes an argument. The steps also show you how
to specify a value for an argument when you assign the procedure to an
object.

<PRE>   <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/support/supportnet/refguide/default.asp">http://www.microsoft.com/support/supportnet/refguide/default.asp</A></B>

</PRE><h3>Example</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Enter the following code in a module sheet:
<P>
<PRE>      Sub MultiUse(fromMenu As Boolean)
         If fromMenu Then
            MsgBox "Called from a menu"
         Else
            MsgBox "Called from a button"
         End If
      End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>Switch to a worksheet and use the Forms toolbar to create an object on
   your sheet.

<P><LI>Select the object and click the right mouse button.

<P><LI>On the shortcut menu, click Assign Macro.

<P><LI>In the Macro Name/Reference box, type the appropriate command for the
   type of object.
<P>
<P><PRE>    - To assign the procedure to a menu bar, type:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>         'MultiUse true'

    - To assign the procedure to a button, type:

         'MultiUse false'

   NOTE: You must include the apostrophes around either statement. Note
   also that you can use other types of arguments; for example, you can use
   an integer rather than a Boolean argument. The following error message:

        Formula is too complex to be assigned to object.

   will be received if you try to pass an argument from within the Assign
   Macro dialog box using something like:

        test(1)

   where "test" is the name of your macro and you are trying to pass a
   value of 1 to the macro.

</PRE></OL>This method of determining how a macro was called can offer different
benefits than the Application.Caller method, which can return many
different data types such as a Range object, a string, an array of numbers,
an array of one number and a string, or an error.
<P>
You can use information functions such as IsObject or Isarray to check the
type of returned values to determine what called the macro.
<P>
When you use an argument to tell the procedure what called it (menu, tool,
or button), your code is designed such that it can tell what kind of result
it will get from Caller, and it can use that information to determine what
else to do.
