<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Visual Basic Programming System, Applications Edition, if you
declare a variable of Name type in your module, as in the following example
<P>
<PRE>   Dim MyVar as Name

</PRE>you receive a syntax error when you run the code.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Visual Basic in Microsoft Excel, Name is a reserved keyword
that conflicts with the Name object of the Names collection.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To declare a variable of Name type, explicitly reference the object, as in
the following example:
<P>
<PRE>   Dim MyVar as Excel.Name

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Dim statement in Visual Basic, Applications Edition, is used to declare
variables and allocate storage space. The syntax is as follows
<P>
<PRE>   Dim varname As &lt;type&gt;

</PRE>where &lt;type&gt; is the data type of the variable. This data type can be an
object type, such as Name. An object type is a type of object exposed by an
application through OLE Automation. An example of using the Dim statement
to declare a variable as Name type is as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub List_Names()
      ' Dimension variable MyName as Name type
      Dim MyName As Excel.Name
      ' Display reference for each name in the names collection
      For Each MyName In ActiveWorkbook.Names
        Count = Count + 1
        MsgBox ActiveWorkbook.Names(Count)
      Next MyName
   End Sub

logical line or you can divide the lines of code and include the line
continuation character. For more information about Visual Basic for
