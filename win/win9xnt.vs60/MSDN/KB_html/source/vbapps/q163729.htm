<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Visual Basic for Applications includes a WordBasic Automation object
(Word.Basic) that includes methods for all the WordBasic statements and
functions available in Word versions 6.x and 7.x.
<P>
When you use a programming language that cannot call a Visual Basic for
Applications or WordBasic instruction using named arguments, for example,
Microsoft Visual Basic 3.0, you must identify these arguments by position
using commas as placeholders.
<P>
To ensure the correct WordBasic command argument positioning when using
OLE Automation to interact with Visual Basic for Applications, use the
Position.hlp file for Word for Windows version 6.x.
<P>
The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Software
Library:

                  This file contains a Help file (POSITION.HLP). This file
                  is for Visual Basic version 3.0 programmers who want to
                  use OLE Automation to access WordBasic in versions of
                  Microsoft Word.

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
WordBasic statements or functions in Microsoft Word can take named
arguments. If your application does not support named arguments, and you
send WordBasic commands through OLE Automation, your application must
specify all the parameters to a WordBasic function in the proper order.
The same call in WordBasic may only require some of the parameters using
named arguments, and those parameters could be provided in any order.
<P>
For most WordBasic statements, the positioning of the arguments is
documented in the WordBasic Help topics or printed reference entries for
those statements. However, the arguments for some statements are not
listed in proper order, or the arguments are irrelevant or have no effect.
These arguments are not documented in WordBasic Help or in the printed
reference.
<P>
For example, the InsertIndex statement corresponds to the Index tab in the
Index and Tables dialog box. The InsertIndex statement takes a number of
arguments that have to do with other tabs in the dialog box, such as the
Table Of Contents tab. Because these arguments are irrelevant to inserting
an index, they are ignored, and are therefore not documented in WordBasic
Help or in the printed reference. But, as an OLE Automation programmer, you
need to be aware of these arguments so you can correctly specify arguments
by position.
<P>
NOTE: If your program was written to call WordBasic commands and you are
anticipating interacting with the Microsoft Word Visual Basic for
Applications language for all future development, it is recommended that
you convert your code from WordBasic to the Microsoft Word Visual Basic
for Applications commands.
<P>
For a listing of these statements and the correct order of the arguments,
look to the Position.txt text file. This file is included on the disk
included with the Word Developer's Kit (located in the Wrdbasic
directory).
