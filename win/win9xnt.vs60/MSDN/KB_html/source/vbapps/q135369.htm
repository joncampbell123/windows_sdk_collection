The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access versions 7.0, 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
This article describes how you can open multiple instances of a form using
Visual Basic for Applications. Opening multiple instances of a form gives
you the flexibility to work on more than one record at once. For example in
an Order Entry application, you can start taking an order, pause and take a
second order, and then return to the first order, without losing any data.
<P>
NOTE: This article explains a technique demonstrated in the sample
files, FrmSampl.exe (for Microsoft Access for Windows 95 version 7.0)
and FrmSmp97.exe (for Microsoft Access 97). For information about how
to obtain these sample files, please see the following articles in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../access/q150895.htm">Q150895</A></B>
   TITLE     : ACC95: Microsoft Access Sample Forms Available on MSL

   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../access/q175066.htm">Q175066</A></B>
   TITLE     : ACC97: Microsoft Access 97 Sample Forms Available on MSL

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This article assumes that you are familiar with Visual Basic for
Applications and with creating Microsoft Access applications using the
programming tools provided with Microsoft Access. For more information
about Visual Basic for Applications, please refer to your version of the
"Building Applications with Microsoft Access" manual.
<P>
The syntax for opening multiple instances of a form includes a Set
statement, the keyword "New" (without the quotation marks), and a form
reference, as in the following example:
<P>
<PRE>   Set x = New Form_Form1

</PRE>When you open multiple instances of a form, the original instance is the
only form object that is stored permanently in the database. The other
instances are temporary and are removed from memory once you close them.
<P>
NOTE: When you close the original instance of a form, all other instances
of the form are closed as well.
<P>
To open multiple instances of a form, follow these steps.
<P>
CAUTION: Following the steps in this example will modify the sample
database Northwind.mdb. You may want to back up the Northwind.mdb file and
perform these steps on a copy of the database.

<OL><P><LI>Open the sample database Northwind.mdb.

<P><LI>Open the Customers form in Design view.

<P><LI>On the View menu, click Code.

<P><LI>Type the following text in the module's Declarations section:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Option Compare Database
      Option Explicit
      Dim x as Form
</PRE>
<P><LI>Close the Module window.

<P><LI>Add a command button to the Customers form and set the following
   properties:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Command Button:
<PRE></PRE>         Name: OpenNewCust
         Caption: Open Customers
         OnClick: [Event Procedure]

</PRE><P><LI>Click the Build button to the right of [Event Procedure] in the OnClick
   property of the command button, and then type the following procedure:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Private Sub OpenNewCust_Click()
      Set x = New Form_Customers
      x.setfocus
      End Sub
</PRE>
<P><LI>Close and save the Customers form.

<P><LI>View the Customers form in Form view and click the command button.
   Note that a second instance of the Customers form opens.
<P>
