The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0c
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you run a Microsoft Visual Basic Programming System, Applications
Edition, sub procedure that has arguments when another Visual Basic
procedure is running, you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Can't perform requested operation

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
You cannot call a Visual Basic sub procedure that has arguments if a
Visual Basic procedure is running at the time. Take for example a
custom dialog box with a control button assigned to a Visual Basic
procedure with an argument. If you run the dialog box using the "Run
Dialog" toolbar button on the Forms toolbar, you can choose the button and
the procedure assigned to that button is run. However, if you show the
dialog box from another Visual Basic procedure, and you click the button
assigned to the procedure that has arguments, you receive the error message
above, because the first Visual Basic procedure is still running. When you
run the dialog box from the Visual Basic procedure, the calling procedure
is suspended while the dialog box is displayed.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Although you cannot call a Visual Basic sub procedure that has
arguments if a Visual Basic procedure is running, you can do either
of the following:

<UL><LI>Call a Visual Basic subroutine that does not have arguments while a
   Visual Basic procedure is running
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Model your macro code after the following example.
<P>
