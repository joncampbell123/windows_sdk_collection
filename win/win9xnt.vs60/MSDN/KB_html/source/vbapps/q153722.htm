The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, versions 7.0, 7.0a
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0c
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The Visual Basic for Applications GetOpenFilename method works differently
in Microsoft Excel for Windows 95 and later than in Microsoft Excel version 
5.0. Also, the Help file entry on GetOpenFilename in Microsoft Excel for Windows
95, version 7.0 and Microsoft Excel 97, is not complete on how the FileFilter 
argument affects the method.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The FileFilter argument for the GetOpenFilename method contains two parts.
In Microsoft Excel, version 5.0, the first part, which is before the comma,
appears in the "List Files of Type:" field in the File Open dialog box. The
second filter, which is after the comma, appears in the File Name field of
the dialog box and is the part that actually affects what files are shown.
If you leave out the second part, the function shows all files. The first
part has no effect on what files are shown. It can be anything. Therefore,
you must make sure the two parts match, because you could have a filter in
the "List Files of Type:" field that does not match the list of files
shown.
<P>
In Microsoft Excel for Windows 95 and Microsoft Excel 97, the Filefilter 
argument affects the GetOpenFilename differently. The entire Filefilter 
string appears in the Files Of Type field. The first part has the effect 
of determining what files will be listed. The first part will do this even 
if the second part is different. The second part of the Filefilter argument 
(the part after the comma) does not determine the list of files displayed 
unless it is used by itself. The first part takes precedence.
<P>
Additionally, characters before a wildcard ("*") are fully recognized in
Microsoft Excel, version 5.0. In Microsoft Excel for Windows 95 and 
Microsoft Excel 97, characters before a wildcard are only recognized in the 
file extension, not in the file name. Any filter with characters before a 
wildcard in the file name is ignored. This means something like "Test*.*" 
does not work as a Filefilter in Microsoft Excel for Windows 95 and Microsoft
Excel 97. It shows no file filter in the open dialog box and lists all files 
in the current folder (directory).
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
For simplification, in Microsoft Excel for Windows 95 and Microsoft Excel 97, 
you can use the first filter as if it were the only filter. However, you must 
include the comma to avoid a syntax error. Also, you should avoid characters 
before a wildcard in the file name.
<P>
For example, use the following format in the module code:
<P>
<PRE>     fileFilter:="Text Files (*.txt),"

The examples below depict the differences between the two versions when
running variations of GetOpenFilename. Each example contains a macro that
can either be run in Microsoft Excel 5.0, Microsoft Excel for Windows
95, or in Microsoft Excel 97. The comments before each macro describe the 
results you receive in each of the three versions.

provided 'as is' and Microsoft does not guarantee that they can be used in
all situations. While Microsoft support engineers can help explain the
functionality of a particular macro, they will not modify these examples to
provide added functionality, nor will they help you construct macros to
meet your specific needs. If you have limited programming experience, you
may want to consult one of the Microsoft Solution Providers. Solution
Providers offer a wide range of fee-based services, including creating
custom macros. For more information about Microsoft Solution Providers,

illustrate, the following are a few examples of the various differences
between the two versions.

         (fileFilter:="Text Files (bob*.txt),bob*.txt")
   End Sub

</PRE><h3>Example 5</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft Excel version 5.0 shows "Text Files (*.tx*)" in the "List Files
of Type:" field and displays files with ".tx" as part of the extension.
<P>

"Text Files (*.tx*)" in the "Files of Type" field and displays files with 
".tx" as part of the extension.
<P>
<PRE>   Sub Example5()
      x = Application.GetOpenFilename _
         (fileFilter:="Text Files (*.tx*),*.tx*")
