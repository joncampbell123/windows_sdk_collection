The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0c
<LI>Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, versions 5.0, 5.0a

<LI>Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL>

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run a Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications procedure to save a 
file using the Save method, if the file is opened as read-only, the file 
may be saved to the current directory or folder, instead of an error 
message appearing indicating that the file cannot be saved.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs when the file that you are saving is open, has a read-
only protection status, and the current directory or folder is not the
directory or folder that contains the file. In this case, the file is saved
to the current directory or folder without displaying an error message
explaining that the file is read-only.
<P>
This is incorrect behavior because the Save method normally saves the file
to the folder or directory that contains the file. A read-only file should
not be saved using the Save method because the Save method does not allow
you to specify where to save a file.
<P>
For example, when you run the following procedure in Microsoft Excel for
the Macintosh, if Macintosh HD:Temp is not the current folder, the file
BOOK1.XLS is created in both the Macintosh HD:Temp folder and in the
current folder:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub SaveFile()
      Workbooks.Add
      ActiveWorkbook.SaveAs FileName:="Macintosh HD:Temp:Book1.xls"
      ActiveWorkbook.Close
      Workbooks.Open FileName:="Macintosh HD:Temp:Book1.xls", _
         ReadOnly:=True
      ActiveWorkbook.Save
   End Sub

</PRE>When you use the Save method to save a file that is open as read-only, and
the current directory or folder IS the directory or folder that contains
the open file, then you receive a dialog box with the following message
<P>
<PRE>   Replace existing '&lt;filename&gt;'?

</PRE>where &lt;filename&gt; is the name of the file you are saving. You then receive
the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Run-time error '1004':

   Cannot save as that name. Document was opened as read-only.

</PRE><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>

</PRE>To avoid this behavior, use any of the following methods.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1: Use the SaveAs Method</h3>
 
<P>
Use the SaveAs method to save the file to another folder or directory as in 
the following examples:
<P>
Macintosh:
<P>
<PRE>   ActiveWorkbook.SaveAs FileName:="Macintosh HD:Excel:Book1.xls"

</PRE>Windows:
<P>
<PRE>   ActiveWorkbook.SaveAs FileName:="C:\Excel\Book1.xls"

</PRE><h3>Method 2: Close and Reopen the File</h3>
 
<P>
Close the file and open it again with read-write access in order to save 
the file to the same directory.
