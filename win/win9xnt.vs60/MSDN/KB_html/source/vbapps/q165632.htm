<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
There is no single method that you can use to remove all items from a
ListBox or ComboBox control on a UserForm. The method that you use to
remove an item depends on whether the ListBox or ComboBox control is bound
to a worksheet. This article contains examples that remove items from a
sample control that is bound to a worksheet and a sample control that is
not bound to a worksheet.
<P>

<P><h3>ListBox or ComboBox Control That Is Bound to a Worksheet</h3>
 
<P>
To build a sample UserForm that contains a ListBox control that is bound to
a worksheet and then remove items in the control, use the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Close and save any open workbooks, and then create a new workbook.

<P><LI>On Sheet1, type the following values:
<P>
       A1: Alpha
       A2: Bravo
       A3: Charlie
       A4: Delta
       A5: Echo

<P><LI>Start the Visual Basic Editor (press ALT+F11).

<P><LI>If the Properties window is not visible, click Properties on the
    View menu (or press F4).

<P><LI>If the Project Explorer window is not visible, click Project Explorer
    on the View menu.

<P><LI>On the Insert menu, click UserForm.

<P><LI>Draw a ListBox control on the UserForm.

<P><LI>Switch to the Properties window (press F4).

<P><LI>Change the RowSource property of the ListBox control to the
    following value:
<P>
       Sheet1!A1:A5

<P><LI>Draw a CommandButton control on the UserForm.

<P><LI>Double-click the CommandButton to open the code window for the
    CommandButton.

<P><LI>In the module, type the following code for the CommandButton
    Click event:
<P>
       Private Sub CommandButton1_Click()
<PRE>           ListBox1.RowSource = ""
       End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>Run the UserForm.
<P>
   The list box that you added to the UserForm is populated with the values
   that you entered on Sheet1.

<P><LI>Click the CommandButton.
<P>
</OL>All of the items are removed from ListBox1.
<P>
<P><h3>ListBox or ComboBox That Is Not Bound to a Worksheet</h3>
 
<P>
To build a sample UserForm that contains a ListBox control that is
populated with an array of values when the UserForm loads and then remove
items in the control, use the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Close and save any open workbooks, and then create a new workbook.

<P><LI>Start the Visual Basic Editor (press ALT+F11).

<P><LI>If the Properties window is not visible, click Properties on the
    View menu (or press F4).

<P><LI>On the Insert menu, click UserForm.

<P><LI>Double-click the UserForm to open the code window for the UserForm.

<P><LI>In the module, type the following code for the UserForm Initialize
    event:
<P>
       Private Sub UserForm_Initialize()
<PRE>           Dim MyArray As Variant
           Dim i As Integer

           'Initialize array with values to populate ListBox.
           MyArray = Array("Alpha", "Bravo", "Charlie", "Delta","Echo")

           For i = LBound(MyArray) To Ubound(MyArray)

               'Add a value from MyArray to ListBox1.
               UserForm1.ListBox1.AddItem MyArray(i)

           Next
       End Sub

    This procedure populates ListBox1 when the UserForm is loaded.

</PRE><P><LI>Draw a ListBox control on the UserForm.

<P><LI>Draw a CommandButton control on the UserForm.

<P><LI>Double-click the CommandButton to open the code window for the
    CommandButton.

<P><LI>In the module, type the following code for the CommandButton
    Click event:
<P>
       Private Sub CommandButton1_Click()
<PRE>           Dim i As Integer

           For i = 1 To ListBox1.ListCount

               'Remove an item from the ListBox.
               ListBox1.RemoveItem 0

           Next i
       End Sub

   This Visual Basic procedure removes all of the items from ListBox1.

</PRE><P><LI>Run the UserForm.

<P><LI>Click the CommandButton.
<P>
</OL>All of the items are removed from ListBox1.
