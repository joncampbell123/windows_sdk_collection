<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
This article describes a method for using a keystroke-plus-click
combination with a command button. For example, you might want click,
ALT+Click, and CTRL+Click to have different actions on the same command
button.
<P>
This article assumes that you are familiar with Visual Basic for
Applications and with creating Microsoft Access applications using the
programming tools provided with Microsoft Access. For more information
about Visual Basic for Applications, please refer to your version of the
"Building Applications with Microsoft Access" manual.
<P>
NOTE: Visual Basic for Applications is called Access Basic in version 2.0.
For more information about Access Basic, please refer to the "Building
Applications" manual.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The sample database Northwind.mdb (or NWIND.MDB in version 2.0) contains a
Main Switchboard form with several buttons, one of which reads "Exit
Microsoft Access." When you click this button, it closes Microsoft Access
completely. Sometimes, you may want to just close the Main Switchboard form
and keep Microsoft Access and the database open.
<P>
Instead of creating one command button to close Microsoft Access and
another button to close the Main Switchboard form, the following example
shows you how to create one button which is capable of doing both,
depending on whether you click the button or press CTRL and then click the
button.

<OL><P><LI>Open the sample database Northwind.mdb (or NWIND.MDB in version 2.0).

<P><LI>Open the Main Switchboard form in Design view.

<P><LI>Add the following event procedure to the OnMouseDown property of the
   Exit Microsoft Access command button:
<P>
   In Microsoft Access 7.0 and 97:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Private Sub ExitMicrosoftAccess_MouseDown(Button As Integer, Shift _
<PRE></PRE>            As Integer, X As Single, Y As Single)
      If Shift And acCtrlMask Then
         DoCmd.Close
      End If
      End Sub

   In Microsoft Access 2.0:

      NOTE: In the following sample code, an underscore (_) at the end of a
      line is used as a line-continuation character. Remove the underscore
      from the end of the line when re-creating this code in Access Basic.

      Sub Exit_Microsoft_Access_MouseDown (Button As Integer, Shift As _
            Integer, X As Single, Y As Single)
      If Shift And CTRL_MASK Then
         DoCmd Close
      End If
      End Sub

   Other constants available for Microsoft Access 7.0 and 97 are
   acShiftMask and acAltMask, representing the SHIFT and ALT keys
   respectively. In Microsoft Access 2.0, you can use SHIFT_MASK and
   ALT_MASK.

</PRE><P><LI>Save the form and open it in Form view.

<P><LI>Click the Exit Microsoft Access button. Note that Microsoft Access
   closes.

<P><LI>Restart Microsoft Access and open the Main Switchboard form in Form
   view.

<P><LI>Press CTRL and then click the Exit Microsoft Access button. Note that
   only the Main Switchboard form closes.
