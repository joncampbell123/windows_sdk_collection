<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, you can determine which items in a multi-selection list
box are selected by using the Selected property of the list box. This
article contains an example of how this can be done with a Microsoft Visual
Basic for Applications procedure.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In a custom dialog box, a multi-selection list box allows you to choose any
number of items from a list. For example, if a list contains Alpha, Bravo,
and Charlie, you can select any, none, or all of those items.
<P>
To determine which items are selected, you can use the Selected property of
the list box. The Selected property of a multi-selection list box is an
array of values: each value is either True, if the item is selected, or
False, if the item is not selected. For example, if the list contains 1, 2,
3, and 4, and 2 and 3 are selected, the Selected property would be the
following array
<P>
<PRE>   False, True, True, False

</PRE>because the first item (1) is not selected, the second and third items (2
and 3) are selected, and the fourth item (4) is not selected.
<P>
An example of how to read the Selected array in a Visual Basic procedure is
shown below.

<P>
<PRE>   <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/support/supportnet/refguide/default.asp">http://www.microsoft.com/support/supportnet/refguide/default.asp</A></B>

</PRE>To create the procedure, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>In a new workbook, insert a new worksheet (Sheet1), a dialog sheet
   (Dialog1), and a Visual Basic module (Module1).

<P><LI>On the worksheet, enter the following values:
<P>
<P><PRE>      A1: Alpha
      A2: Bravo
      A3: Charlie
      A4: Delta
      A5: Echo
      A6: Foxtrot
      A7: Golf
      A8: Hotel
</PRE>
<P><LI>On the dialog sheet, add an OK button that is set to dismiss the dialog
   box.

<P><LI>On the dialog sheet, do the following to add a multi selection list box
   ("List1") that is linked to Sheet1!$A$1:$A$8.
<P>
   a. On the Forms toolbar, choose the List Box button. Drag on the dialog
<P><PRE>      frame to create a list box.
</PRE><P>
   b. Select the list box.
<P>
   c. In the Name box, type "List1" (without the quotation marks) and
<P><PRE>      press the ENTER key.
</PRE><P>
   d. From the Format menu, choose Object.
<P>
   e. Select the Control tab.
<P>
   f. In the Input Range box, type "Sheet1!$A$1:$A$8" (without the
<P><PRE>      quotation marks).
</PRE><P>
   g. Under Selection Type, select the Multi option.
<P>
   h. Choose OK to accept the change.
<P>
   The list box is now linked to Sheet1!$A$1:$A$8 and is a multi selection
   list box.

<P><LI>In Module1, enter the following:
<P>
<PRE>   '----------------------------------------------------------------------
   Sub ShowSelectedItems()

      ' Dimension variables.
      Dim CurList As ListBox, Chosen As Integer
      Dim LTemp As Variant, LItem As Variant
      Dim Counter As Integer, MsgBoxText As String

      ' Set an object name for the list box to make it
      ' easier to reference.
      Set CurList = _
        DialogSheets("Dialog1").ListBoxes("List1")

      ' Initialize the list so that none of the items are
      ' selected.
      CurList.Selected = _
        Array(False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False)

      ' Show the dialog box and set variable 'chosen' to
      ' the value returned by the dialog box.
      chosen = DialogSheets("Dialog1").Show

      ' If cancel is chosen, exit the procedure.
      If chosen = 0 Then GoTo canceled

      ' Set the variable LTemp equal to the array of values
      ' indicating the selection state of the list box items.
      LTemp = CurList.Selected

      ' Initialize the Counter variable.
      Counter = 1

      ' Iterate through the loop once for each item in the
      ' array (which is the same as iterating once for each
      ' item in the list box).
      For Each LItem In LTemp

      ' If the value of the current item is True...
      If LItem = True Then

         ' Add text to the MsgBoxText variable indicating
         ' that the item is selected.
         ' CurList.List(Counter) returns the text of the selected item
         ' ("Alpha", "Bravo", and so on).
         MsgBoxText = MsgBoxText &amp; CurList.List(Counter) &amp; _
           " is selected. " &amp; Chr(13)

      ' Otherwise...
      Else

         ' Add text to the MsgBoxText variable indicating that
         ' the item is not selected.
         ' CurList.List(Counter) returns the text of the unselected item
         ' ("Alpha", "Bravo", and so on).
         MsgBoxText = MsgBoxText &amp; CurList.List(Counter) &amp; _
           " is NOT selected. " &amp; Chr(13)

      End If

      ' Increment the Counter so we can get the value of the
      ' next selected item.
      Counter = Counter + 1

      ' Repeat until all the items in the list have
      ' been checked.
      Next

      ' Display a dialog box indicating the selection state
      ' of each item in the list.
      MsgBox MsgBoxText

   ' If the Cancel button was chosen, exit procedure.
   canceled:

   End Sub
   '----------------------------------------------------------------------

</PRE><P><LI>To run the subroutine, position the insertion point anywhere in the
   procedure, and either press F5 or click Start on the Run menu.

<P><LI>When the dialog box is displayed, select one or more items in the list
   box, and choose the OK button.
<P>
</OL>A dialog box is displayed that indicates for each item in the list whether
it was selected or not.
<P>
Note that you can modify this example and substitute any functions that
perform a desired task using the selection state of the list items. For
example, you might want to insert the current list item into a cell on a
worksheet. To do this, you could use the following command
<P>
<PRE>   Sheets("Sheet1").Cells(10, 10).Value = CurList.List(Counter)

</PRE></OL>to put the current list item into cell J10 on Sheet1.
