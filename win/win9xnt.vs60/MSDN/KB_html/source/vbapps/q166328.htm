<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article provides a sample Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications
macro (Sub procedure) that searches a presentation for linked Excel OLE
objects and changes the linked source of these objects to a single source
workbook that you specify. This macro retains links to specific spreadsheet
ranges and objects, and allows you to change the source workbook.
<P>
This macro assumes that the linked objects are all Excel Spreadsheet
objects and that the links are to sections of spreadsheets, and not to
entire workbooks.
