The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Project for Windows, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Project, you may not be able to use the Change Working Time
dialog box to change the working and nonworking days on the calendar after
you run a macro that edits the base calendar.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs if you use the Working property in a Visual Basic,
Applications Edition, macro to set the working or nonworking days for a
date range on the base calendar. The problem occurs if the date range you
specify extends beyond one month. When this occurs, you cannot use the
Change Working Time dialog box to change the working time for the days in
the second and following months in that date range.
<P>
For example, if you run a macro that contains the following command
<P>
<PRE>    ActiveProject.BaseCalendars(1).Period("3/29/95", "5/5/95").Working = _
       False

</PRE>when you open the Change Working Time dialog box, and select the month of
April 1995, you cannot select the Working option for any of the days in
this month. The Nonworking option remains selected for each day in the
range 3/29/95 to 5/5/95.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, use any of the following methods.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1</h3>
 
<P>
Use the BaseCalendarEditDays Method to edit the base calendar as in
the following example:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub ChangeWorkDays
      ' Set all days in the range 3/29/95 to 5/5/95 as nonworking
      BaseCalendarEditDays Name:="Standard", startDate:="3/29/95", _
        endDate:="5/5/95", Working:=False
   End Sub

</PRE><h3>Method 2</h3>
 
<P>
Use the Working Property of the Period object with one month
intervals. For example, use the following three commands to set the
Working property to the value False for the entire range 3/29/95 to
5/5/95 instead of one command:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub ChangeWorkDays
     ActiveProject.BaseCalendars(1).Period("3/29/95","3/31/95").Working = _
       False
     ActiveProject.BaseCalendars(1).Period("4/1/95","4/30/95").Working = _
       False
     ActiveProject.BaseCalendars(1).Period("5/1/95","5/5/95").Working = _
       False
   End Sub
