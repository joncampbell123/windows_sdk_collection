The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Project for Windows, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Project, if you use the References dialog box in a module
stored in GLOBAL.MPT to remove a reference to an object library file (.OLB)
or a project file, and this is the only change you make to GLOBAL.MPT, then
the change you made is not saved when you exit Microsoft Project. That is,
the next time you run Microsoft Project, and open the module, the check box
for the file that you cleared in the References dialog box is still
selected.
<P>
This behavior occurs even if you have deleted the file that you cleared the
reference to before you ran Microsoft Project.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs because clearing a reference to a file in the
References dialog box is not recognized as a change to a file in Microsoft
Project. If you make changes to the GLOBAL.MPT file, the file is
automatically saved when you exit Microsoft Project. However, if the only
change you make to this file in Microsoft Project is to clear the reference
to an object library file (.OLB), or a project file in a module in
GLOBAL.MPT, this change is not saved.
<P>
Note that if the only change you make to a project file is to clear the
reference to a file in a module in the project file using the References
dialog box, you are not prompted to save the changes when you close the
file.
<P>
Similar behavior also occurs in Microsoft Excel.
<P>

Microsoft Knowledge Base:

<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../urjump.htm">Q114627</A></B>
   TITLE     : XL5: No Prompt to Save Changes After Tools Reference Change

</PRE>Note that when you ADD a reference to a file in a module in GLOBAL.MPT
using the References dialog box, this change is saved. Additionally, you
are prompted to save changes when you close a project after you add a
reference to a module stored in that project.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
To avoid losing the changes you make in the References dialog box,
make a change in the module in which you used the References dialog
box. The change can be simply adding a character to a macro in the
module, and then deleting the character. This causes the GLOBAL.MPT
file to be saved when you exit Microsoft Project (if the module is
contained in GLOBAL.MPT). If the module is stored in a project file,
you receive a dialog box prompting you to save the changes to the
file when you close the project file.
<P>
Note that for a module that is contained in a project file, you can
also Save the project file after you make the changes and before you
close the project file to avoid losing the changes.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft
products listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching
this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
