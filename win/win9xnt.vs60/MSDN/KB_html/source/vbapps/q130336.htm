The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access versions 2.0, 7.0, 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
This article demonstrates a user-defined function that you can use to set
the AllowZeroLength property to Yes for all the Text and Memo fields in
every table in a database.
<P>
This article assumes that you are familiar with Visual Basic for
Applications and with creating Microsoft Access applications using the
programming tools provided with Microsoft Access. For more information
about Visual Basic for Applications, please refer to your version of the
"Building Applications with Microsoft Access" manual.
<P>
NOTE: Visual Basic for Applications is called Access Basic in Microsoft
Access version 2.0. For more information about Access Basic, please refer
to the "Building Applications" manual.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
By setting the AllowZeroLength property, you can control whether a zero-
length string ("") is a valid entry for Text and Memo fields. The default
setting for the AllowZeroLength property is No, but you can set the
AllowZeroLength property to Yes for every table in a database by following
these steps.
<P>
CAUTION: Following the steps in this example will modify the sample
database Northwind.mdb (or NWIND.MDB in version 2.0). You may want to back
up the Northwind.mdb file or perform these steps on a copy of the
Northwind database.
<P>
NOTE: In the following sample code, an underscore (_) at the end of a line
is used as a line-continuation character. Remove the underscore from the
end of the line when re-creating this code in Access Basic.

<OL><P><LI>Create a module and type the following line in the Declarations section,
   if it is not already there:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Option Explicit
</PRE>
<P><LI>Type the following procedure:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Function SetAllowZeroLength ()
<PRE></PRE>          Dim I As Integer, J As Integer
          Dim db As Database, td As TableDef, fld As Field

          Set db = CurrentDB()
          'The following line prevents the code from stopping if you do not
          'have permissions to modify particular tables, such as system
          'tables.
          On Error Resume Next
          For I = 0 To db.TableDefs.Count - 1
             Set td = db(I)
             For J = 0 To td.Fields.Count - 1
                Set fld = td(J)
                If (fld.Type = DB_TEXT Or fld.Type = DB_MEMO) And Not _
                  fld.AllowZeroLength Then
                   fld.AllowZeroLength = True
                End If
             Next J
          Next I
          db.Close
      End Function

</PRE><P><LI>To test the function, type the following line in the Debug window (or
   Immediate window in version 2.0), and then press ENTER:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ? SetAllowZeroLength()
</PRE><P>
   Note that after a few seconds, the AllowZeroLength property is changed
   to Yes for all the Text and Memo fields in every table in the database.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: By changing the If...Then condition and the assignment that
immediately follows it in the code above, you can loop through the
tables to modify the following field properties also: Name, ValidationRule,
ValidationText, Required, and DefaultValue.
