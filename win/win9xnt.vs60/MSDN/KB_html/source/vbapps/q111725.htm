<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In the versions of Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications that ship with 
Microsoft Excel versions 5.0 and later, FOR loops behave differently than 
they do in the Microsoft Excel version 4.0 macro language.
<P>
The respective macro commands are as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   Visual Basic
   ------------

   For counter = startValue To endValue
   Next counter

   Microsoft Excel Version 4.0 Macro Commands
   ------------------------------------------

   =FOR("counter",startValue,endValue)
   =NEXT()

</PRE>In Visual Basic, the number of iterations for the loop cannot be changed by 
changing the value of the variable used to set the ending value for the 
loop while the loop is in progress (this behavior is standard for most 
programming languages that use FOR loops). However, you can change the 
value of the variable in a Microsoft Excel version 4.0 style macro using 
the equivalent functions, FOR() and NEXT().
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Excel Version 4.0 Macro Example</h3>
 
<P>
In the following Excel 4.0 style macro, the loop is originally set to run
ten times. However, it will only run 5 times because the ending value is
modified during the loop. To test this behavior, enter the following on a
Microsoft Excel 4.0 macro sheet:
<P>
<PRE>   A1: y=10
   A2: =FOR("x",1,y)
   A3: y=5
   A4: =NEXT()
   A5: =ALERT(x)
   A6: =RETURN()

</PRE>To run the macro, select cell A1, click Macro on the Tools menu, and then 
click Run.
<P>
The ALERT() statement in A5 will display the value 6, which means that the
loop only ran 5 times, as opposed to the 10 times that the original value
of "y" was set for.
<P>
<P><h3>Sample Visual Basic Procedure</h3>
 
<P>
In the following Visual Basic macro, the loop is originally set to run 10 
times and it will run 10 times, even though the macro changes the value of 
the variable that is used to set the ending value of the loop.
<P>
To test this macro:

<OL><P><LI>Enter the following in a new Visual Basic module:
<P>
<PRE>      Sub MyLoop()
          Dim x, y As Integer

          y = 10
          For x = 1 To y
              y = 5
          Next x
          MsgBox x
      End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>Position the insertion point in the line that reads "Sub MyLoop()" and
   either press F5 or click Start on the Run menu.
<P>
</OL>The MsgBox statement in the above macro displays the value 11, which means
the loop ran through 10 times, even though we changed the value of the
variable used to set the ending value of the loop.
