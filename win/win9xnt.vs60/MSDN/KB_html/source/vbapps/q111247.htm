The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0c
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows NT, version 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0
</UL>

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you use the GetObject function in a Microsoft Visual Basic version
3.0 procedure to open and save a Microsoft Excel workbook, the
workbook is saved as hidden and does not appear when you open the
workbook again.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To avoid saving a workbook as hidden when you use the GetObject
function in a Visual Basic procedure to open and save the workbook,
unhide the workbook before saving it, as in the following Visual Basic
procedure:
<P>
<PRE>   ' Dimension variable xl as Object type
   Dim xl As Object
   ' Set xl equal to Excel workbook as OLE Automation object
   ' and open file BOOK1.XLS located in c:\excel5
   Set xl = GetObject("C:\excel5\book1.xls")
   ' Make the hidden workbook visible
   xl.Parent.Windows("BOOK1.XLS").Visible = True
   ' Save the file BOOK1.XLS
   xl.Parent.Save
   ' Close the file BOOK1.XLS
   xl.Parent.[Close]
   ' Free the memory used for storing xl variable
   Set xl = Nothing

</PRE>Microsoft provides examples of Visual Basic procedures for
illustration only, without warranty either expressed or implied,
including but not limited to the implied warranties of
merchantability and/or fitness for a particular purpose. This Visual
Basic procedure is provided 'as is' and Microsoft does not guarantee
that it can be used in all situations. Microsoft does not support
modifications of this procedure to suit customer requirements for a
particular purpose. Note that a line that is preceded by an
apostrophe introduces a comment in the code--comments are provided to
explain what the code is doing at a particular point in the
procedure. Note also that an underscore character (_) indicates that
code continues from one line to the next. You can type lines that
contain this character as one logical line or you can divide the
lines of code and include the line continuation character. For more
information about Visual Basic for Applications programming style,
see the "Programming Style in This Manual" section in the "Document
Conventions" section of the "Visual Basic User's Guide.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Note that the above behavior also occurs when you use the CreateObject
function in a Visual Basic, Applications Edition, procedure to open and
save a Microsoft Excel workbook. However, because Microsoft Excel has an
object library, use the functions defined in that library rather than the
GetObject or CreateObject function when you access Microsoft Excel objects
in a Visual Basic, Applications Edition, procedure.
