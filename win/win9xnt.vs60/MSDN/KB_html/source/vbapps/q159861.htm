<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run a macro that sets the Caption property for a window, the
caption for the active window is set regardless of the window that you
specify in your macro. For example, the following line of code sets the
caption for the active window instead of setting the caption for Book1 as
specified:
<P>
<PRE>   Windows("Book1").Caption = "My Caption"

</PRE><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft provides examples of Visual Basic for Applications procedures for
illustration only, without warranty either expressed or implied, including,
but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and/or fitness
for a particular purpose. The Visual Basic procedures in this article are
provided 'as is' and Microsoft does not guarantee that they can be used in
all situations. While Microsoft support engineers can help explain the
functionality of a particular macro, they will not modify these examples to
provide added functionality, nor will they help you construct macros to
meet your specific needs. If you have limited programming experience, you
may want to consult one of the Microsoft Solution Providers. Solution
Providers offer a wide range of fee-based services, including creating
custom macros. For more information about Microsoft Solution Providers,
call Microsoft Customer Information Service at (800) 426-9400.
<P>
To workaround this problem, modify your macro so that the window for which
you wish to set the caption is active prior to setting that window's
caption. The following sample macro demonstrates this:
<P>
<PRE>Sub ChangeCaption()

   Dim w as Window

      'Set the active window to a variable
      Set w = ActiveWindow

      'Activate Book1 and change the caption of the
      'active window Book1 to "My Caption"
      Windows("Book1").Activate
      ActiveWindow.Caption = "My Caption"

      'Activate the window referred to by the variable w
      w.Activate

End Sub

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Excel 97 for
Windows. This problem was corrected in Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows,
Service Release 1.
