<P>
In Microsoft Excel, you can determine the country/region code that corresponds to
the version of Microsoft Excel you are running. These country/region codes can
be helpful in creating custom applications.

</PRE>The codes shown above are derived from the Country/Region Codes used by the
telephone system in the United States of America.
<P>
In a custom application, it may be necessary to determine which language
version of Microsoft Excel is running. For example, if you are writing a
custom application for your company, which has offices in two different
countries, the country/region code would make it possible to write a single
macro for both offices. You could display different dialog boxes based on
which language version of Microsoft Excel is being used. Below are
examples of returning and using the country/region code in a Microsoft Visual 
Basic for Applications macro and an XLM macro.
<P>
<P><h3>Sample Visual Basic Procedure</h3>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel versions 5.0 and later you can use the
Application.International function to return information about the
current country/region and international settings of Microsoft Excel. The built-
in constant "xlCountryCode" will return the country/region code of the version
of Microsoft Excel you are running.
<P>
Below is a macro example that will return the country/region code and will then,
based on that code, display "Hello" in the appropriate language:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub Code()
       Country_Code = Application.International(xlCountryCode)
       If Country_Code = 1 Then
           MsgBox ("Hello")
       ElseIf Country_Code = 34 Then
           MsgBox ("Hola")
       End If
   End Sub

</PRE><h3>XLM Macro Code Example</h3>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel version 4.0, the GET.WORKSPACE function can be used to
return information about the workspace. GET.WORKSPACE has one argument,
type_num. Type_Num is a number specifying the type of workspace
information you want.
<P>
To return the country/region code of the version of Microsoft Excel you are
running, use the type number of 37. Type 37 returns a 45-item horizontal
array of the items related to country/region versions and settings. You must
index this array to return a specific item. The country/region code is the first
item in this array.
<P>
Below is a macro example that will index the array of items returned by
GET.WORKSPACE(37) to get the country/region code and then, based on that code,
display "Hello" in the appropriate language:
<P>
<PRE>   A1: Code_Macro
   A2: =INDEX(GET.WORKSPACE(37),1)
   A3: =IF(A2=1)
   A4: =ALERT("Hello")
   A5: =ELSE.IF(A2=34)
   A6: =ALERT("Hola")
   A7: =END.IF()
   A8: =RETURN()
