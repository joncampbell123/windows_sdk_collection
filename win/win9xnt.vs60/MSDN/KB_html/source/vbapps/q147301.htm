<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel version 5.0, the mouse pointer is normally displayed as
an hourglass when you run a macro. The exception to this is when you run a
macro from a control in a custom dialog box. In this case, the mouse
pointer continues to be displayed as an arrow, and does not give you an
indication that the macro (event procedure) is running. This article
demonstrates how to change the mouse pointer in Microsoft Excel for Windows
version 5.0 while displaying a dialog box from a Visual Basic for
Applications macro in Microsoft Excel version 5.0.
<P>
NOTE: In Microsoft Excel version 7.0 you can change the mouse pointer to an
hourglass.
<P>

   TITLE     : XL: Controlling Appearance of Mouse Pointer Within Macro

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Excel version 5.0 does not have a Cursor object; therefore, you
cannot change the mouse pointer to an hourglass from a Visual Basic for
Applications statement in the macro.
<P>
The example below demonstrates how to change the mouse pointer in Microsoft
Excel for Windows version 5.0 while displaying a dialog box from a Visual
Basic for Applications macro in Microsoft Excel version 5.0.

<P><h3>Visual Basic Code Example</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>'This example requires two dialog sheets.
'Dialog #1: "Maindialog" (without the quotation marks)
'Dialog #2: "WaitDialog" (without the quotation marks)

'On Dialog #1, place a button and assign the procedure, "showWaitDialog,"
'(without quotation marks)to the button.
'Set the DismissButton property for the button.

'On Dialog #2, "WaitDialog," assign the frame to the procedure,
'"WaitDialog," (without the quotation marks).

'Run the procedure "main" from a worksheet.
'The procedure "main" will display a dialog box with a button that is
'assigned to the procedure "showWaitDialog" (without the quotation marks).
'Click the button. This will run the procedure "showWaitDialog." When
</PRE>"WaitDialog" shows, the procedure assigned to the frame will run. The
<PRE>'procedure "WaitDialog" will run and show the dialog box "WaitDialog." The
'macro assigned to its frame "showWaitDialog" will run, changing the mouse
'pointer and showing the dialog box "WaitDialog."
