<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you run a Visual Basic for Applications macro in Microsoft Excel 97,
and your macro code reads the Name property of an item in the Names
collection, the result may be slightly different than the result you 
receive in earlier versions of Microsoft Excel. This behavior occurs 
because defined names are case sensitive in Microsoft Excel 97.
<P>
This article explains the new behavior and the problems it may cause.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>

Microsoft provides programming examples for illustration only, without

language being demonstrated and the tools used to create and debug 
procedures. Microsoft support engineers can help explain the functionality 
of a particular procedure, but they will not modify these examples to 
provide added functionality or construct procedures to meet your specific 
needs. If you have limited programming experience, you may want to contact 
the Microsoft fee-based consulting line at (800) 936-5200. For more 
information about the support options available from Microsoft, please see 
the following page on the World Wide Web:
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/support/supportnet/refguide/default.asp">http://www.microsoft.com/support/supportnet/refguide/default.asp</A></B>

</PRE>When you define names in a workbook in Microsoft Excel, the workbook cannot
contain two or more defined names that differ from each by only the case of
some or all of their letters. For example, you cannot create the following
defined names in the same workbook:
<P>
<PRE>   Test
   test
   tEST
   TEST

</PRE>Although the names use different combinations of uppercase and lowercase
letters, the letters in each name are all the same. Therefore, Microsoft
Excel considers these four names to be identical. Defining a name in a
workbook when another identical name (except for the case) already exists
results in the elimination of the original name. For example, if you define
the name "test" (without the quotation marks), Microsoft Excel eliminates
the name "Test" (without the quotation marks) from the workbook.
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, you can check the name of a defined name by using
Visual Basic for Applications macro code similar to the following:
<P>
<PRE>   MsgBox ThisWorkbook.Names(5).Name

   MsgBox ThisWorkbook.Names("test").Name

</PRE>In Microsoft Excel 97, if you specify a name within the parentheses in the
sample code, the Name property returns a name that is identical (in terms
of case) to the name that is defined in the Define Name dialog box. In
earlier versions of Microsoft Excel, the Name property returns a name that
is identical (in terms of case) to the name that you specify in the
parentheses.
<P>
To demonstrate the difference in behavior, run the following subroutine:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub TestName()

       MyArray = Array("test", "Test", "tEST", "TEST")
       For Each xName In MyArray
           ThisWorkbook.Names.Add Name:=xName, RefersTo:="5"
           MsgBox ThisWorkbook.Names("test").Name
       Next xName

   End Sub

</PRE>The message boxes display different values, depending on the version of
Microsoft Excel that you are using.
<P>
<PRE>                  MsgBox Value in      MsgBox Value in
   Defined name   Microsoft Excel 97   Microsoft Excel 5.0, 7.0
   ------------------------------------------------------------

   test           test                 test
   Test           Test                 test
   tEST           tEST                 test
   TEST           TEST                 test

</PRE>This change in behavior may cause a problem if you compare the name that is
returned by a Name property to a string. For example, although the
following code always works in earlier versions of Microsoft Excel, it may
not work in Microsoft Excel 97:
<P>
<PRE>   MsgBox ThisWorkbook.Names("test").Name = "test"

</PRE>You can prevent problems from occurring by standardizing the case of the
name before you compare it. For example, the following code works correctly
in any version of Microsoft Excel:
<P>
<PRE>   MsgBox UCase(ThisWorkbook.Names("test").Name) = UCase("test")
</PRE>
