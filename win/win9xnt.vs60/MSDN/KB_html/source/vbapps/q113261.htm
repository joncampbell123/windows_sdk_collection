<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, when you create a lookup table, the lookup functions
may return the #N/A error value, or, if you are using the functions in a
Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications procedure or macro, you may receive 
a "type mismatch" error, even though the values in the lookup table are 
sorted in ascending order and the value being looked up appears to fall 
within the range of the lookup table values.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When you look up a text value, Microsoft Excel looks only at the text 
values in your table. Similarly, when you look up a numeric value, 
Microsoft looks only at the numeric values.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft provides programming examples for illustration only, without

implied warranties of merchantability and/or fitness for a particular
purpose. This article assumes that you are familiar with the programming
language being demonstrated and the tools used to create and debug
procedures. Microsoft support engineers can help explain the functionality
of a particular procedure, but they will not modify these examples to
provide added functionality or construct procedures to meet your specific
needs. If you have limited programming experience, you may want to contact
the Microsoft fee-based consulting line at (800) 936-5200. For more
information about the support options available from Microsoft, please see
the following page on the World Wide Web:
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/support/supportnet/refguide/default.asp">http://www.microsoft.com/support/supportnet/refguide/default.asp</A></B>

</PRE>If the first column (VLOOKUP) or row (HLOOKUP) of your lookup table 
contains both text and numeric values, you can use Microsoft Excel to sort 
your table in ascending order. In this case, the numeric values will appear 
at the beginning of the table and the text values will appear at the end of 
the table. Both text and numbers are then sorted as expected. 
For example, the following values:
<P>
<PRE>   A1: 3
   A2: 1
   A3: c
   A4: 2
   A5: d
   A6: b

</PRE>will be sorted as:
<P>
<PRE>   A1: 1
   A2: 2
   A3: 3
   A4: b
   A5: c
   A6: d

</PRE>However, if you attempt to use a lookup function to locate a text value
that is less than the first text value, the lookup the function returns the 
#N/A error value.
<P>
It may appear that =VLOOKUP("a",A1:A6,1) should return the value 3, which
is the largest value that is less than the lookup value a. However, the
formula returns the #N/A error value instead. This behavior also occurs
with HLOOKUP(), LOOKUP(), and MATCH() with Match Type arguments of 1 or
negative one -1.
<P>
The same behavior also holds true if you attempt to look up a numeric
value that is less than the first numeric value in your lookup table.
<P>
<P><h3>Sample Visual Basic Macro Using VLookup</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   Sub test()
      MsgBox Application. _
      VLookup("a", Workbooks("book1.xls"). _
      Worksheets("sheet1").Range("hi"), 1, False)
   End Sub

</PRE>Note that in order to test this sample macro, you must create a range on
sheet1 in book1 similar to the sample range above, and you must give the
range the defined name "hi" (without the quotation marks).
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1: Include Minimum and Maximum Values for Both Text and Numbers</h3>
 
<P>
If you want your lookup table to be split into separate tables for text and 
numbers (the default), you must include minimum values for both the text 
and the numeric values in your lookup table.
<P>
Zero is the lowest positive integer and the blank space character is the 
lowest printable text character.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 2: Format All Cells as Text</h3>
 
<P>
If you want the table to behave the way it appears after it is sorted by 
Microsoft Excel, such that it returns the highest numeric value if a text 
value is looked up, then you must treat your table as text only. The 
following are two ways to do this:

<UL><LI>Enter every cell in your table as text. Numeric values can be entered as
   text by typing an apostrophe before the value (versions of Microsoft 
   Excel earlier than 5.0) or by formatting the cells as text (Microsoft 
   Excel version 5.0).
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE>
<LI>Convert the lookup table and the value you are looking up to text by 
   entering your formula into an array formula. The following is an example 
   that assumes the value to be looked up is located in cell B1:
<P>
<P><PRE>      =VLOOKUP(TEXT(B1,"@"),TEXT(A1:A6,"@"),1)
</PRE><P>
<PRE>   NOTE: The above formula must be entered as an array formula. To enter a    
   formula as an array formula in Microsoft Excel for Windows, press 
   CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER. In Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, press 
   COMMAND+RETURN.
