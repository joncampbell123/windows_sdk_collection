<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Excel 97 includes many new built-in chart types, including cone
and pyramid charts. By default, these chart types contain cones or pyramids
that taper to a point for each data point in a series; the height of each
cone or pyramid is equal to the value of the data point.
<P>
You can change the shape of the cones or pyramids for a series so that it
tapers to the value of the largest data point in all the chart series. With
this shape, all cones or pyramids for the series are the same, but they are
truncated according to the values of the data points. Note that you cannot
manually change the cones or pyramids for all of the series in a chart at
one time. You must change the shape of the cones or pyramids for each
series separately (one series at a time). To change the cones or pyramids
for all the series at one time, you must use a Visual Basic for
Applications macro.
<P>
This article provides an example macro that modifies all the series in a
chart to the same shape.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>

Microsoft provides examples of Visual Basic for Applications procedures for

provided 'as is' and Microsoft does not guarantee that they can be used in
all situations. While Microsoft support engineers can help explain the
functionality of a particular macro, they will not modify these examples to
provide added functionality, nor will they help you construct macros to
meet your specific needs. If you have limited programming experience, you
may want to consult one of the Microsoft Solution Providers. Solution
Providers offer a wide range of fee-based services, including creating
custom macros. For more information about Microsoft Solution Providers,

<P>
<P><h3>Creating the Sample Chart</h3>
 
<P>
Before you use the sample macro, create a chart to modify. To do this, use
the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Save and close all open workbooks, and then create a new workbook.

<P><LI>In Sheet1 of the new workbook, type the following data:
<P>
<PRE>      A1: a   B1: 1   C1: 3   D1: 2
      A3: b   B2: 4   C2: 2   D2: 1
      A3: c   B3: 5   C3: 1   D3: 3

</PRE><P><LI>Select cell A1, and then click Chart on the Insert menu.

<P><LI>In step 1 of the Chart Wizard, click Cone in the Chart Type list.

<P><LI>Under Chart Sub-type, click the sample chart in the third row of types
   and click Finish.
<P>
</OL>An embedded 3-D Cone chart appears on Sheet1.
<P>
NOTE: The cones for each data point taper to a point.
<P>
<P><h3>Sample Macro for Changing Cone Shapes</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start the Visual Basic Editor (press ALT+F11).

<P><LI>On the Insert, menu click Module.

<P><LI>Type the following code in the module:
<P>
<PRE>      Sub Change_Chart_Shapes()

          Dim x As Chart
          Dim y As Series

          'x is the Chart object.
          Set x = ActiveSheet.ChartObjects(1).Chart

          'Loop through all the chart series.
          For Each y In x.SeriesCollection

              'Set the series chart subtype.
              y.BarShape = xlConeToMax

          Next
      End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>Run the Change_Chart_Shapes macro.

<P><LI>Switch to Microsoft Excel (press ALT+F11).
<P>
</OL>Each of the cones (except one) in the chart no longer tapers to a point.
The only cone that tapers to a point is the cone that represents the value
in cell B3, which is the greatest value in all of the chart series.
<P>

Microsoft Excel Help, type the following text

</PRE></OL>and then double-click the selected text to go to the "Examples of chart
types (cone, cylinder, and pyramid)" topic.

Assistant in the Visual Basic Editor, type "barshape", click Search, and
then click to view "BarShape Property".
