The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 97, if you run a Visual Basic for Applications macro
that attempts to add a comment to a cell in a worksheet, you may receive
the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Run-time error '1004':
   NoteText method of Range class failed

</PRE>The same macro works without error in earlier versions of Microsoft Excel.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs if the macro uses a line of code similar to the
following
<P>
<PRE>   ActiveCell.NoteText Text:="This is a comment."

</PRE>to add a comment to a cell when two or more worksheets are grouped or
selected.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft provides examples of Visual Basic for Applications procedures for
illustration only, without warranty either expressed or implied, including,
but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and/or fitness
for a particular purpose. The Visual Basic procedures in this article are
provided 'as is' and Microsoft does not guarantee that they can be used in
all situations. While Microsoft support engineers can help explain the
functionality of a particular macro, they will not modify these examples to
provide added functionality, nor will they help you construct macros to
meet your specific needs. If you have limited programming experience, you
may want to consult one of the Microsoft Solution Providers. Solution
Providers offer a wide range of fee-based services, including creating
custom macros. For more information about Microsoft Solution Providers,
call Microsoft Customer Information Service at (800) 426-9400.
<P>
There are two methods you can use to prevent this problem from occurring:
<P>
<P><h3>Method One</h3>
 
<P>
Do not use the NoteText method with the ActiveCell property directly.
Instead, use the ActiveCell property to determine what cell to comment, and
then apply the comment to that cell using the Range and NoteText methods.
The following code example demonstrates one way in which this may be done.
<P>
<PRE>   Sub Test1()

       'Use "Range(ActiveCell.Address)" in place of "ActiveCell".
       Range(ActiveCell.Address).NoteText Text:="This is a comment."

   End Sub

</PRE><h3>Method Two</h3>
 
<P>
If you want to apply the same comment to the active cell in all of the
grouped worksheets, you can use For Each and Next to loop through all of
the worksheets. The following code example demonstrates one way in which
this may be done.
<P>
<PRE>   Sub Test2()

       'For each currently selected worksheet...
       For Each xSheet In ActiveWindow.SelectedSheets

           '...add a comment to the active cell in that sheet.
           xSheet.Range(ActiveCell.Address).NoteText Text:="Hello!"

       'Repeat for all of the grouped worksheets.
       Next xSheet

   End Sub

</PRE>This code will apply the same comment to the active cell in all of the
grouped worksheets.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design of Microsoft Excel 97.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In earlier versions of Microsoft Excel, if you run a macro that contains
the following line of code
<P>
<PRE>   ActiveCell.NoteText Text:="This is a comment."

</PRE>the comment is only applied to the active cell in the active worksheet.
Even though other worksheets may be grouped, the comment is not applied to
them. When you do this, you do not receive an error message.
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 97, you receive the error message mentioned in the
"Symptoms" section if your macro uses the above line of code to apply a
comment to the active cell when multiple worksheets are grouped.
<P>
Note that you cannot manually comment a cell by clicking Comment or Note on
the Insert menu when multiple worksheets are grouped in any version of
Microsoft Excel.
