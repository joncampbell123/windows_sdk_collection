<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
If your Microsoft Access database contains a reference to multiple library
databases, type libraries, or object libraries, it is possible for the same
class name to exist in more than one referenced file. If you want to
declare a variable of that type, you must explicitly state which reference
contains the class you want to use. This article addresses how to specify
a particular reference file in code.
<P>
This article assumes that you are familiar with Visual Basic for
Applications and with creating Microsoft Access applications using the
programming tools provided with Microsoft Access. For more information
about Visual Basic for Applications, please refer to your version of the
"Building Applications with Microsoft Access" manual.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Suppose your Microsoft Access database contains two references: one
reference to a library database called MyDatabase, which contains a class
called RecordSet, and another reference to Microsoft DAO 3.5 Object
Library (or Microsoft DAO 3.0 Object Library in version 7.0), which also
contains a class called RecordSet. In order to dimension a variable of
type RecordSet from the MyDatabase reference, you must use the following
syntax:
<P>
<PRE>   Dim rs as MyDatabase.RecordSet

</PRE>If you do not explicitly declare the reference name when you dimension the
variable, then whichever reference appears first in the References dialog
box is automatically assumed. If the wrong reference is assumed, you may
encounter error messages when you try to use the properties and methods of
the declared object.
<P>
You can use the Microsoft Access Object Browser to determine the reference
name. To use the Object Browser, open any module in Design view, and then
click Object Browser on the View menu (or press the F2 key). The name that
appears in the Project/Library box (or in the Libraries/Databases box in
version 7.0) of the Object Browser is the name of that reference. In
Microsoft Access 7.0, if there is a dash (-) in the name of a reference,
use the characters to the left of the dash as the reference name. For
example, if you see "DAO - Microsoft DAO 3.0 Object Library" in the
Libraries/Databases box, use DAO as the name of the reference.
<P>

database, search the Help Index for "setting references."

For more information about using the Object Browser, search the Help Index
for "Object Browser."
