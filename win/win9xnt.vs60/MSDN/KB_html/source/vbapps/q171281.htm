The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 97, if you write a Visual Basic for Applications macro
that uses the PasteSpecial method, the macro may not work correctly if it
attempts to perform either of the following actions:

<UL><LI>Use Paste Special to paste validation
<LI>Use Paste Special to paste all information except borders
<P>
</UL>For example, when the macro attempts to paste information except borders,
nothing is pasted.
<P>
Note that the same macro works correctly in earlier versions of Microsoft
Excel.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs because the Paste argument used by the PasteSpecial
method uses the wrong value; it uses the value 6 instead of the value 7.
Because the value 6 is used, the xlPasteAllExceptBorders constant
incorrectly causes validation formatting to be pasted.
<P>
To paste information except borders, the xlPasteAllExceptBorders constant
should use a value of 7. When the value is 6, the xlPasteAllExceptBorders
constant causes the PasteSpecial method to paste validation formatting when
you run the macro.
<P>
There is no constant that causes all information except borders to be
pasted.
<P>
NOTE: There is no xlPasteValidation constant, either in Visual Basic or
mentioned in the Help topic for the PasteSpecial method.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft provides examples of Visual Basic for Applications procedures for
illustration only, without warranty either expressed or implied, including,
but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and/or fitness
for a particular purpose. The Visual Basic procedures in this article are
provided 'as is' and Microsoft does not guarantee that they can be used in
all situations. While Microsoft support engineers can help explain the
functionality of a particular macro, they will not modify these examples to
provide added functionality, nor will they help you construct macros to
meet your specific needs. If you have limited programming experience, you
may want to consult one of the Microsoft Solution Providers. Solution
Providers offer a wide range of fee-based services, including creating
custom macros. For more information about Microsoft Solution Providers,
call Microsoft Customer Information Service at (800) 426-9400.
<P>
To work around this problem, use the Paste argument and set it to the
correct value. To do this, modify the macro so that it resembles one of the
following examples.
<P>
<P><h3>Paste Validation Only</h3>
 
<P>
To paste only validation formatting, change the value of the Paste argument
to 6, as in the following example:
<P>
<PRE>   Selection.PasteSpecial Paste:=6, Operation:=xlNone

</PRE>To avoid confusion, Microsoft recommends that you use this method instead
of using the xlPasteAllExceptBorders constant because it does not perform
the correct operation.
<P>
<P><h3>To Paste All Information Except Borders</h3>
 
<P>
If you want to paste all copied information except borders, change the
value of the Paste argument to 7, as in the following example:
<P>
<PRE>   Selection.PasteSpecial Paste:=7, Operation:=xlNone

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If you click Paste Special on the Edit menu while recording a Visual Basic
macro in Microsoft Excel 97, the Paste argument recorded in the code may be
incorrect. For example, the action you record and the constant that is
recorded are listed in the following table.
<P>
<PRE>   Paste Special action   Recorded constant
   ----------------------------------------------

   Validation             xlPasteAllExceptBorders

   All Except Borders     7

</PRE>Note that if you run the recorded code, it works correctly even though it
does not appear to be correct.
<P>
If you write a macro or if you edit a recorded macro, the PasteSpecial
method may not work correctly if you use the constant noted in Help.
