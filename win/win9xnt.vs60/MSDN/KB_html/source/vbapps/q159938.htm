The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 97, when you run a Visual Basic for Applications
subroutine that protects a workbook, you may receive the following error
message:
<P>
<PRE>   Run-time error '5':
   Invalid procedure call or argument

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs if you attempt to set either the Structure argument
or the Windows argument (or both) of the Protect method to a value other
than True or False. Although you can do this in earlier versions of
Microsoft Excel, you cannot use a value other than True or False in
Microsoft Excel 97.
<P>
For example, this line of code does not work:
<P>
<PRE>   ActiveWorkbook.Protect Structure:=0, Windows:=1

</PRE><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft provides examples of Visual Basic for Applications procedures for
illustration only, without warranty either expressed or implied, including,
but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and/or fitness
for a particular purpose. The Visual Basic procedures in this article are
provided 'as is' and Microsoft does not guarantee that they can be used in
all situations. While Microsoft support engineers can help explain the
functionality of a particular macro, they will not modify these examples to
provide added functionality, nor will they help you construct macros to
meet your specific needs. If you have limited programming experience, you
may want to consult one of the Microsoft Solution Providers. Solution
Providers offer a wide range of fee-based services, including creating
custom macros. For more information about Microsoft Solution Providers,
call Microsoft Customer Information Service at (800) 426-9400.
<P>
If you use the Structure and Windows arguments of the Protect method, you
must set them to either True or False. For example, use the following line
of code:
<P>
<PRE>   ActiveWorkbook.Protect Structure:=False, Windows:=True

</PRE>This code works in Microsoft Excel 97 and in earlier versions of Microsoft
Excel.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design of Microsoft Excel 97.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Structure and Windows arguments of the Protect method allow you to
decide whether the structure of the workbook (the relative location of
sheet tabs, and whether sheets are hidden) and the workbook's window (size
and position on the screen) are protected.
<P>
In many programming languages, including Visual Basic for Applications, the
Boolean value "False" is often equal to 0, and you can sometimes substitute
the value 0 whenever False is required for the value of an argument.
Similarly, the Boolean value "True" is often equal to any nonzero value
(for example, 5), and you can sometimes substitute a nonzero value whenever
True is required for the value of an argument.
<P>
However, this convention does not apply to the Structure and Windows
arguments of the Protect method in Microsoft Excel 97. The only acceptable
values for these arguments are True and False.
