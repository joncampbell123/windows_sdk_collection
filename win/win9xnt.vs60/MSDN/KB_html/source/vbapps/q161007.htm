<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
This article demonstrates two methods of using the NotInList event to add
a new record to a combo box on a form.
<P>
This article assumes that you are familiar with Visual Basic for
Applications and with creating Microsoft Access applications using the
programming tools provided with Microsoft Access. For more information
about Visual Basic for Applications, please refer to your version of the
"Building Applications with Microsoft Access" manual.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following examples use the Orders form in the Northwind sample
database to demonstrate two methods of using the NotInList event to add a
record to a combo box. The NotInList event fires when you type a new
company in the CustomerID (labeled Bill To:) field on the Orders form.
<P>
The first method uses Visual Basic for Applications code to
programmatically add a new record to the Customers table. The second
method opens the Customers form and lets you add a new record yourself.
<P>
CAUTION: Following the steps in this example will modify the sample
database Northwind.mdb. You may want to back up the Northwind.mdb file or
perform these steps on a copy of the Northwind database.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1: Using Code to Add a Record to a Table</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Open the sample database Northwind.mdb.

<P><LI>Note that the LimitToList property of the CustomerID combo box is set
   to Yes.

   following event procedure:
