<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you click a menu command while recording a Visual Basic for
Applications macro, Microsoft Excel does not record the macro code for the
menu command you clicked. When you run the recorded macro, it may not
perform as expected.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs if while recording a macro, you click a menu command
that was added to a menu by an add-in file included with Microsoft
Excel 98 Macintosh Edition. For example, when you click Save As HTML on the
File menu while recording a macro, the recorded macro does not contain code
to run the macro assigned to the Save As HTML command. Microsoft Excel
does not record the code because the menu command was added by the Internet
Assistant Wizard add-in file.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
If you are creating a macro that executes code assigned to a menu
command, you must manually edit the macro and add the appropriate code.
Code assigned to a menu will be assigned using the OnAction property in
Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications.
<P>
Note that some of the affected menu commands use their own commands; for
example, the Solver add-in contains commands that you can add to your macro
when you want to set up and execute the Solver.
<P>
NOTE: Add-in macros cannot be edited as they are protected and hidden.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design in Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
