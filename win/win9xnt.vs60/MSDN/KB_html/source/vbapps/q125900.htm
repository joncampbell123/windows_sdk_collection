<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, when you run a Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications 
procedure that contains a mathematical calculation, you may receive the
following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Run-time error '6':
   Overflow

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This error message appears when the mathematical calculation involves
numbers or variables of one data type, such as Integer, and you assign the
result of the calculation to a variable of a different data type, such as
Double or Long, even if the result of the calculation is within the range
of the data type for the resulting variable. For example, you receive this
error message when you run the following procedure:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub Test()
       Dim MyVarInteger As Integer
       Dim MyVarDouble As Double
       MyVarInteger = 256
       MyVarDouble = 256 * MyVarInteger
   End Sub

</PRE>The error message occurs in this case because the number 256 is a constant
of Integer data type. Because the variable MyVarInteger is also a value of
Integer data type, the multiplication calculation is performed as an
Integer calculation. The error message occurs because the result of the
calculation, 65536, is larger than the range for an Integer data type
(which must be between -32768 and 32767).
<P>
By declaring the result, MyVarDouble, as Double data type, the calculation
multiplies the two Integer data types and then attempts to convert the
result to a Double data type. Because the result is not within the range
for an Integer data type, the error occurs before the result is converted
to the Double data type.
<P>
You also receive this error message when you run the following procedure:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub Test2()
       x = (3832908 * 1000) / (2 * 218706)
       MsgBox x
   End Sub

</PRE>In this example, because the values in the calculation are constants, you 
cannot dimension the resulting variable, x, as Double, because you cannot 
convert an Integer to a Double data type "internally" by assigning the 
result of a calculation that contains an Integer to a Double data type.
<P>

</PRE>To avoid this error message when you perform a mathematical calculation in 
a Visual Basic procedure, you must convert at least one of the operands to 
a data type with a range that is greater than the resulting value. This 
forces the calculation to be performed using the largest data type. To do 
this, you can use either of the following methods:
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1</h3>
 
<P>
Use a data type conversion function, such as CLng in the following example:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub Test()
      Dim MyVarInteger As Integer
      Dim MyVarDouble As Double
      MyVarInteger = 256
      ' Use CLng function to convert MyVarInteger to Long data type.
      MyVarDouble = 256 * CLng(MyVarInteger)
   End Sub

</PRE><h3>Method 2</h3>
 
<P>
Use a type-declaration character as in the following examples:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub Test()
      Dim MyVarInteger As Integer
      Dim MyVarDouble As Double
      MyVarInteger = 256
      ' Follow 256 with an ampersand to identify value as Long data type.
      MyVarDouble = 256&amp; * MyVarInteger
   End Sub

   Sub Test2()
      ' Follow 1000 with number sign to identify value as Double data type.
      x = (3832908 * 1000#) / (2 * 218706)
      MsgBox x
   End Sub

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Help topic for this error message indicates that a possible cause for 
this error message includes the following:
<P>
<PRE>   The result of an assignment, calculation, or data type conversion is too
   large to be represented within the range allowed for that type of
   variable.

</PRE>For example, the range allowed for a variable of data type Double is -
1.79769313486232E308 to -4.94065645841247E-324 (for negative values) and
4.94065645841247E-324 to 1.79769313486232E308 (for positive values). The
range allowed for a variable for data type Long is -2,147,483,648 to
2,147,483,647.
