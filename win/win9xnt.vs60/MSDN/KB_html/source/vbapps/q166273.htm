The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, versions 7.0, 7.0a
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0c
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 5.0 or 7.0, when you attempt to run a Visual Basic for
Applications macro to insert a Visual Basic module into a workbook or to
record a new macro, you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Can't find project or library

</PRE>When you click OK, the References dialog box appears. One or both of the
following items are listed in the Available References list box:
<P>
<PRE>   MISSING: Microsoft Office 8.0 Object Library

   MISSING: OLE Automation

</PRE>NOTE: When you record a new Visual Basic macro, you may also receive the
following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Unable to record.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when all of the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>The workbook contains a reference either to the Microsoft Office 8.0
   Object Library or to the OLE Automation library.
<P>
   NOTE: If you create the workbook in Microsoft Excel 97 or if you use the
   References dialog box in Microsoft Excel 97 to create the reference, the
   workbook may contain such a reference.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -and-
</PRE>
<LI>In Microsoft Excel 97, you saved the workbook in the Microsoft Excel
   5.0/95 Workbook format.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -and-
</PRE>
<LI>You opened the workbook in Microsoft Excel 5.0 or 7.0 and attempted to
   run a macro, to insert a Visual Basic module into the workbook, or to
   record a new macro.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -and-
</PRE>
<LI>No Microsoft Office 97 program is installed on the computer on which you
   are running Microsoft Excel 5.0 or 7.0.
<P>
</UL><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, use either of the following methods.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1: Disable Missing References in the References Dialog Box</h3>
 
<P>
If the References dialog box appears when you attempt to run a macro, to
insert a macro, or to record a new macro, use the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>In the list of Available References, clear any check boxes to the left
   of references that are labeled "MISSING."

<P><LI>After you clear all the missing references, click OK.

<P><LI>Run the macro, insert or record a new macro.
<P>
</OL>The References dialog box does not appear.
<P>
NOTE: Save the workbook before you close it. Otherwise, the change to the
References dialog box may not be saved. For more information, please see
the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

</PRE></OL><h3>Method 2: Remove References in Microsoft Excel 97</h3>

</PRE>You can prevent the References dialog box from appearing in Microsoft Excel
5.0 or 7.0 by removing references that are potentially missing from the
workbook while it is open in Microsoft Excel 97. The following sample macro
removes references:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub RemoveLibraryReferences()

       On Error Resume Next
       Dim xObject As Object

       Set xObject = ThisWorkbook.VBProject.References.Item("Office")
       ThisWorkbook.VBProject.References.Remove xObject

       Set xObject = ThisWorkbook.VBProject.References.Item("stdole")
       ThisWorkbook.VBProject.References.Remove xObject

   End Sub

</PRE>When you run the macro, it programmatically removes the reference to the
Microsoft Office 8.0 Object Library and OLE Automation from the workbook.
You can then save the workbook in the Microsoft Excel 5.0/95 Workbook
format. When you open the workbook in Microsoft Excel 5.0 or 7.0, and then
run a macro, insert a module, or record a new macro, the error message does
not appear.
<P>
NOTE: You cannot run this macro in Microsoft Excel 5.0 or 7.0. The macro
works ONLY in Microsoft Excel 97.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you use a workbook that is saved in the Microsoft Excel 5.0/95
Workbook format in Microsoft Excel 5.0 and 7.0, this problem may occur when
the Microsoft Office 8.0 Object Library (Mso97.dll) or OLE Automation
(Stdole2.tlb) is unavailable. If you install any of the Microsoft Office 97
programs on your computer, the Mso97.dll and Stdole2.tlb files should be
available.
<P>
Note that this problem occurs only if the workbook contains a reference to
the Microsoft Office 8.0 Object Library or to OLE Automation. In Microsoft
Excel 97, you can view references by clicking References on the Tools menu
in the Visual Basic Editor. In Microsoft Excel 5.0 or 7.0, you can view
references by clicking References on the Tools menu when a Visual Basic
module is the active sheet.
