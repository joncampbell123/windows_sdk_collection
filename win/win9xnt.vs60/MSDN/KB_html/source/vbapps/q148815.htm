<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In a Microsoft Excel worksheet, you can use TextBox objects to add text
that is not limited by the boundary of a cell. In Microsoft Excel, you can
also use text boxes on dialog sheets and chart sheets when specially
formatted text is required.
<P>
The text string that is copied to or from a TextBox object has a 255-
character restriction when you use the Characters method in Visual Basic
for Applications. In other words, although a text box is capable of holding
approximately 2,000 characters, the text must be added in strings that are
no more that 255 characters in length. You can use the Sub procedures in 
the "More Information" section of this article to work around this 
restriction.

</PRE>The first Sub procedure (that is, TextBox_To_TextBox) demonstrates how to 
copy text from one TextBox DrawingObject into another text box. The second
<PRE>Sub procedure Cell_Text_To_TextBox, demonstrates a method that you can use 
</PRE>to copy the value of a range of cells into a text box.
<P>
The following Sub procedure copies the text from one text box on the active
sheet to another text box on the active sheet.
<P>
<P><h3>Sample Visual Basic Procedures</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   Sub TextBox_To_TextBox()

      ' Dimension the variables.
      Dim x As Integer
      Dim txtBox1 As TextBox, txtBox2 As TextBox
      Dim theText As String

      ' Set txtBox1 and txtBox2 equal to the active sheet's TextBox
      ' objects. Replace the ordinal number with your TextBox names
      ' in quotes. For example: ActiveSheet.DrawingObjects("Text 1")
      Set txtBox1 = ActiveSheet.DrawingObjects(1)
      Set txtBox2 = ActiveSheet.DrawingObjects(2)

      ' Create a For-Next construct that loops until there is no more
      ' text in txtBox1.
      For x = 1 To txtBox1.Characters.Count Step 250

         ' Place the first text box text into a variable called theText.
         theText = txtBox1.Characters(start:=x, Length:=250).Text

         ' Place the value of theText variable into second text box.
         txtBox2.Characters(start:=x, Length:=250).Text = theText

      Next
   End Sub

</PRE>The following Sub procedure copies the values from a range of cells that 
you specify into a text box on the active sheet.
<P>
<PRE>   Sub Cell_Text_To_TextBox()

      ' Dimension the variables.
      Dim txtBox1 As TextBox
      Dim theRange As Range, cell As Range
      Dim startPos As Integer

      ' Set txtBox1 equal to the active sheet's TextBox object. You can
      ' replace the ordinal number with your text box name in quotes.
      ' For example: ActiveSheet.DrawingObjects("Text 1")
      Set txtBox1 = ActiveSheet.DrawingObjects(1)

      ' Set a range on the active sheet equal to the range object text
      ' that you are interested in copying to the text box.
      Set theRange = ActiveSheet.Range("A1:A10")

      'Set the starting position for the text.
      startPos = 1

      ' Create a For-Each construct to loop through the cells in the range.
      For Each cell In theRange

         ' Populate the textbox with the cell values using the Characters 
         ' method.
         ' Note: Chr(10) can be used to add a new line in the textbox for 
         ' each cell.
         txtBox1.Characters(start:=startPos, _
            length:=Len(cell.Value)).Text = cell.Value &amp; Chr(10)

         ' Update the startPos variable to keep track of where the next 
         ' string of text will begin in the textbox.
         startPos = startPos + Len(cell.Value) + 1

      Next cell
   End Sub
