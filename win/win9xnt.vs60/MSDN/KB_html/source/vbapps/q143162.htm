<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multiuser skills.
<P>
This article describes how to create and use a Visual Basic for
Applications Sub procedure called GetFormDimensions to obtain a form
window's right and down measurements for use in the MoveSize macro action.
This article also demonstrates how to position a form immediately below or
to the right of a second form.
<P>
This article assumes that you are familiar with Visual Basic for
Applications and with creating Microsoft Access applications using the
programming tools provided with Microsoft Access. For more information
about Visual Basic for Applications, please refer to your version of the
"Building Applications with Microsoft Access" manual.
<P>
NOTE: This article explains a technique demonstrated in the sample
files, FrmSampl.exe (for Microsoft Access for Windows 95 version 7.0)
and FrmSmp97.exe (for Microsoft Access 97). For information about how
to obtain these sample files, please see the following articles in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../access/q150895.htm">Q150895</A></B>
   TITLE     : ACC95: Microsoft Access Sample Forms Available on MSL

   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../access/q175066.htm">Q175066</A></B>
   TITLE     : ACC97: Microsoft Access 97 Sample Forms Available on MSL

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Access you can use the WindowWidth and WindowHeight form
properties to determine the current width and height of the window a form
is contained in. However, there are no properties to determine the
window's right and down measurements (these measurements are commonly
used in the MoveSize macro action to position a form window).
<P>
The right and down measurements, along with the width and height, are
useful if you want to position a form side-by-side with another form.
The following examples demonstrate how to create and use the
GetFormDimensions Sub procedure to obtain these measurements and use them
to position a form to the right of, and then below, another form using the
MoveSize macro action.
