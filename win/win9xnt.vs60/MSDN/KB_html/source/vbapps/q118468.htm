The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual Basic Programming System, Applications Edition,
   version 1.0
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0c
<LI>Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, versions 5.0, 5.0a

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The DoEvents function surrenders execution of the macro so that the
operating system can process other events. The DoEvents function passes
control from the application to the operating system. Some instances in
which DoEvents may be useful include the following:

<UL><LI>Hardware I/O
<LI>Delay Loops
<LI>Operating System Calls
<LI>DDE Deadlocking
<P>
</UL>This article also discusses potential problems associated with the DoEvents
function.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Hardware I/O</h3>
 
<P>
If your code waits for an input from any I/O device, the DoEvents function
speeds up the application by multitasking. As a result, the computer does
not seems to pause or stop responding (hang) while the code is executing.
<P>
Example:
<P>
<PRE>   Open "com1" For Input As #1
   Input #1, x
   Do Until x = Chr(13)
   DoEvents
   '...
   '...
   Input #1, x
   Loop

</PRE><h3>Delay Loops</h3>
 
<P>
In a delay loop, the DoEvents function can allow the CPU operating system
to continue with any pending jobs.
<P>
Example:
<P>
<PRE>   X = Timer()
   Do While X + 10 &gt; Timer()
       DoEvents
   Loop

</PRE><h3>Operating System Calls</h3>
 
<P>
When Visual Basic calls the operating system, the operating system may
return the control even before processing the command completely. Doing so
may prevent any macro code that depends on an object generated by the call
from running. In the example below, the Shell function starts the Microsoft
Word application. If Word is not yet open, any effort to establish a DDE
link to it will halt the code. By using DoEvents, your procedure makes sure
that an operation, such as Shell, is completely executed before the next
macro statement is processed.
<P>
Example:
<P>
<PRE>   z% = Shell("WinWord Source.Doc",1)
   DoEvents
   ...
   ...

</PRE><h3>DDE Deadlocking</h3>
 
<P>
Consider a situation in which a Visual Basic macro calls an application
that is waiting for a second application to get some data. If the macro
does not give control to the second application, the result is a deadlock.
In DDE conversations between multiple applications, using DoEvents removes
the possibility of this type of deadlocking.
<P>
<P><h3>Problems Associated with DoEvents</h3>
 

<UL><LI>Using too many nested DoEvents statements may deplete the stack space
   and therefore generate an "Out of Stack Space" error message. This error
   is referring to the application stack space allocated to the Microsoft
   Excel application.

<LI>Make sure the procedure that has given up control with DoEvents is not
   executed again from a different part of your code before the first
   DoEvents call returns; this can cause unpredictable results.

<LI>Once DoEvents relinquishes control to the operating system, it is not
   possible to determine when Microsoft Excel will resume the control.
   After the operating system obtains control of the processor, it will
   process all pending events that are currently in the message queue (such
   as mouse clicks and keystrokes). This may be unsuitable for some real-
   time data acquisition applications.
