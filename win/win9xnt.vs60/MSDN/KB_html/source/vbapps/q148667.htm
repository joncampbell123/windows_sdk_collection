<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Some Visual Basic for Applications procedures that run smoothly in
Microsoft Excel version 5.0 for Windows may run out of stack space when
you run them in Microsoft Excel version 5.0c.
<P>
This behavior occurs primarily with procedures that are run from buttons on
custom dialog sheets. (Not all stack space errors will produce the "out of
stack space" error message.)
<P>
For example, if a button from a custom dialog box currently calls a
secondary procedure, and if you run out of stack space under Microsoft
Excel 5.0c, your procedures may look something like this:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub Procedure1()
      DialogSheets(1).Show
   End Sub

   'This is being called by a button on DialogSheets(1)
   Sub Procedure2()
      msgbox "hello"
   End Sub

</PRE><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To avoid out of stack space errors, rewrite the procedures such that
buttons on custom dialogs do not directly start a secondary procedure;
instead, design the macro such that it toggles a Boolean variable (or
"flag"). Then, evaluate the flag with an If statement to decide whether or
not to call the next procedure.
<P>
<P><h3>Example</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft provides examples of Visual Basic for Applications procedures for
illustration only, without warranty either expressed or implied, including,
but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and/or fitness
for a particular purpose. The Visual Basic procedures in this article are
provided 'as is' and Microsoft does not guarantee that they can be used in
all situations. While Microsoft support engineers can help explain the
functionality of a particular macro, they will not modify these examples to
provide added functionality, nor will they help you construct macros to
meet your specific needs. If you have limited programming experience, you
may want to consult one of the Microsoft Solution Providers. Solution
Providers offer a wide range of fee-based services, including creating
custom macros. For more information about Microsoft Solution Providers,
call Microsoft Customer Information Service at (800) 426-9400.
<P>
You can rewrite the procedure in the following way: make sure the button on
the dialog previously called Procedure2 can be dismissed and have it call
the FlagFlipping procedure instead. To set the button to be dismissable:

<OL><P><LI>Select the button.

<P><LI>On the Format menu, click Object.

<P><LI>Click the Control tab and select (place a check mark in) the Dismiss
   check box .
<P>
</OL><h3>Revised Procedures</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   Dim SecondProcedure As Boolean

   Sub Procedure1()
      SecondProcedure = False
      DialogsSheets(1).Show
      If SecondProcedure = True then
         Procedure2
      End If
   End Sub

'this is being called by a button on DialogSheets(1)
   Sub FlagFlipping()
      SecondProcedure = True
   End Sub

   Sub Procedure2()
      msgbox "hello"
   End Sub

</PRE></OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Excel version
5.0c for Windows. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
