<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The Visual Basic for Applications GetSpellingSuggestions method does not
provide a means for checking for repeated words. However, after you run a
macro that use GetSpellingSuggestions, repeated words are flagged in Word.
<P>
The "Workaround" section of this article includes a macro you can use to
look for repeated words.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>

</PRE>The following sample macro checks a document for repeated words. If a
repeated word is found, the user is prompted to delete the repeated word or
to skip the deletion and continue checking the remainder of the document.
<P>
<PRE>   Sub CheckForRepeatedWords()
      Dim oSpErr As Object
      Dim spSugg As SpellingSuggestions
      Dim msg As String
      Dim response As Integer
      For Each oSpErr In ActiveDocument.SpellingErrors
         Set spSugg = oSpErr.GetSpellingSuggestions
         Select Case spSugg.SpellingErrorType
            Case wdSpellingNotInDictionary
            Case wdSpellingCapitalization
            Case Else
               'This case can be modified to perform a
               'different function dependent upon the need.
               oSpErr.Select
               msg = "Delete this repeated word?"
               response = MsgBox(msg, vbYesNoCancel, "Repeated Word")
               If response = vbYes Then
                  Selection.Expand (wdWord)
                  Selection.Delete
               End If
               If response = vbCancel Then Exit Sub
         End Select
      Next
   End Sub
