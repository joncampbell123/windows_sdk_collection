<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0c
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOM</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel versions 5.x and 7.0 for Windows, the Caption property
of a Menu or a MenuItem will contain an ampersand character (&amp;) if the Menu
or MenuItem has a quick key assigned to it. If an ampersand actually
appears in the name of the Menu or MenuItem, the Caption property for that
item will contain two ampersands right next to each other.
<P>
When you read the Caption property in a Visual Basic macro (for example, if
you display this property in a message box), this ampersand will appear as
part of the text for the caption.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs because, although ampersands are used to assign quick
keys to a Menu or MenuItem, they are interpreted as part of the caption
text.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you create the Menu or MenuItem, either in a macro or by using the
Menu Editor, an ampersand is used to indicate that the next character is
the designated quick key.
<P>
For example, if you want to add the command "Begin Process" to a menu, and
you want the P in "Process" to be a quick key, you would type "Begin
&amp;Process" in the Caption field in the Menu Editor. The "Begin Process" menu
item would then appear with an underline under the letter P.
<P>
If you want a Menu or MenuItem to actually contain an ampersand, you
must enter two ampersands directly adjacent to each other.
<P>
For example, to create a Menu called "Shipping &amp; Receiving", you
would enter "Shipping &amp;&amp; Receiving" in the Caption field. If you also
wanted to assign a quick key to the S in "Shipping", the Caption
field would contain "&amp;Shipping &amp;&amp; Receiving".

is provided 'as is' and Microsoft does not guarantee that it can be
used in all situations. Microsoft does not support modifications of
this procedure to suit customer requirements for a particular purpose.
Note that a line that is preceded by an apostrophe introduces a
comment in the code--comments are provided to explain what the code is
doing at a particular point in the procedure. Note also that an
underscore character (_) indicates that code continues from one line
to the next. You can type lines that contain this character as one
logical line or you can divide the lines of code and include the line
continuation character. For more information about Visual Basic for

Example 1--Results of reading the Caption property
<P><h3>of a Menu or MenuItem that has a quick key assigned to it</h3>
 
<P>
To run this first example, position the cursor in the line which reads "Sub
GetCaptions1()" and either press the F5 key or choose Start from the Run
menu.
<P>
<PRE>'----------------------------------------------------------------------
</PRE>Option Explicit
<P>
<PRE>Sub GetCaptions1()

   'Dimension variables.
   Dim Alpha As String

   'Put the Caption of the third menu item of the first menu of the
   'first menu bar into the variable Alpha.
   Alpha = MenuBars(xlWorksheet).Menus(1).MenuItems(3).Caption

   'Show the Caption. It should be "&amp;Close".
   MsgBox Alpha

   'Put the Caption of the first menu of the first menu bar into the
   'variable Alpha.
   Alpha = MenuBars(xlWorksheet).Menus(1).Caption

   'Show the Caption. It should be "&amp;File".
   MsgBox Alpha
End Sub
'----------------------------------------------------------------------

</PRE>Example 2--The results of reading the Caption property
<P><h3>of a Menu or MenuItem that actually contains an ampersand</h3>
 
<P>
To run the second example, position the cursor in the line which reads
"Sub GetCaptions2()" and either press the F5 key or choose Start from
the Run menu.
<P>
<PRE>'----------------------------------------------------------------------
</PRE>Option Explicit
<P>
<PRE>Sub GetCaptions2()

   'Dimension variables.
   Dim Bravo As String

   'Add a menu item "Shipping &amp; Receiving" to the first menu bar.
   'Enter the following two lines as a single line.
   MenuBars(xlWorksheet).Menus.Add Caption:="&amp;Shipping &amp;&amp; Receiving", _
      Before:="File"

   'Put the Caption of the first menu of the first menu bar into the
   'variable Bravo.
   Bravo = MenuBars(xlWorksheet).Menus(1).Caption

   'Show the Caption. It should be "&amp;Shipping &amp;&amp; Receiving".
   MsgBox Bravo
End Sub
