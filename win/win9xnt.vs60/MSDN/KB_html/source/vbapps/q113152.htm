<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Visual Basic Programming System, Applications Edition, when
you edit or run a procedure, command argument names in the procedure may
not be capitalized.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When you edit or run a procedure in a Visual Basic, Applications Edition
module, all built-in commands and some argument names are automatically
capitalized to make it easier to read your code. Built-in command argument
names and identifier names appear with the capitalization you used when you
typed them, unless they happen to be the same as a command name (in which
case, they are capitalized the same way as the command) or you typed them
with different capitalization previously in the same procedure (in which
case, the previous capitalization is used).
<P>
For example, if you enter the following line of code in a Visual Basic
module
<P>
<PRE>   filesaveas format:=2, name:="Test", backup:=true

</PRE>when you press ENTER with the insertion point at the end of this line, or
run the procedure that contains the command, the command appears as
follows:
<P>
<PRE>   FileSaveAs format:=2, Name:="Test", backup:=True

</PRE>FileSaveAs is capitalized because it is a built-in command. Because
"format" and "backup" are not built-commands, they are not capitalized.
Name is a built-in command, although it is an argument name in this
example, so it is capitalized. True is a built-in value so it is
capitalized.
<P>
If you then change the above line of code to the following
<P>
<PRE>   FileSaveAs format:=2, Name:="Test", BaCKup:=true

</PRE>when you press ENTER with the insertion point at the end of this line or
run the procedure that contains the command, the command appears as you
typed it. Because "backup" is not a built-in command, it retains the
capitalization you give it.
<P>
If you then enter a new line of code in the same procedure using the same
parameters as follows
<P>
<PRE>   filesaveas format:=2, name:="Test2", backup:=true

</PRE>when you press ENTER with the insertion point at the end of this line or
run the procedure that contains the command, the command appears as
follows:
<P>
<PRE>   FileSaveAs format:=2, Name:="Test2", BaCKup:=True

</PRE>Because you have previously used the "backup" argument in the procedure, it
is capitalized the same as the first instance you typed in the procedure
(BaCKup) even though "backup" is not a built-in command.
