<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you create a custom project in Microsoft Visual Basic for 
Applications, you may want to alter options in the user environment in such 
a way that when the user activates your project file, their environment is 
altered, but when the user activates another file, their environment is 
restored to the defaults you choose and the toolbars they had visible 
initially. This article contains an example of the type of code necessary 
to do this.
<P>

</PRE>This set of Sub procedures must work together to be effective. The
Run_Me_First procedure must be run first.
<P>
NOTE: The Run_Me_First procedure hides the sheet tabs in your workbook.
Therefore, after you run this code, you must press CTRL+PAGE UP or
CTRL+PAGE DOWN to move through the sheets in your workbook.
<P>
Note that the sample code in this article is a simple subset of the
possibilities available to you (you may want to enhance this set of
environment alterations).
