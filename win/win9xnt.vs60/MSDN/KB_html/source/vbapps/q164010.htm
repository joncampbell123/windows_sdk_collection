<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In Visual Basic for Applications, you cannot trap the following undefined
<PRE>Sub procedure or Function error:

   Compile Error: Sub or Function not defined

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft provides programming examples for illustration only, without
warranty either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the
implied warranties of merchantability and/or fitness for a particular
purpose. This article assumes that you are familiar with the programming
language being demonstrated and the tools used to create and debug
procedures. Microsoft support engineers can help explain the functionality
of a particular procedure, but they will not modify these examples to
provide added functionality or construct procedures to meet your specific
needs. If you have limited programming experience, you may want to contact
the Microsoft fee-based consulting line at (800) 936-5200. For more
information about the support options available from Microsoft, please see
the following page on the World Wide Web:
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/support/supportnet/refguide/default.asp">http://www.microsoft.com/support/supportnet/refguide/default.asp</A></B>

</PRE>An undefined Sub or Function is an attempt to call a Sub procedure or
Function that does not exist.
<P>
The following sample Visual Basic for Applications macro makes a call to
the non-existent function, "MyFunction". The error listed earlier in this
article will occur before the macro begins to run or compile.
<P>
<PRE>   Sub MyMacro()
      On Error Resume Next
      x = MyFunction()
   End Sub

</PRE>Error trapping does not work with undefined subroutines, functions, or
commands. To avoid these type errors, the macro must be designed so that
it does not call an undefined subroutine, function, or command.
Specifically, when you create your macro make sure that the following
conditions are satisfied:

<UL><LI>The Sub procedure or Function exists.

<LI>The Sub procedure or Function is not misspelled.

<LI>The Sub procedure or Function is not declared as Private.

<LI>If the Sub procedure or Function exists in a custom template
   or document project other than the project in which the calling
   routine exists, make sure that a reference has been added to the
   custom template project or document.
<P>
   NOTE: You cannot add a reference to a project within a document
   whose underlying template is the same template as the calling
   procedure.
<P>
</UL><h3>Adding a Project Reference</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   To add a project reference, follow these steps:

</PRE><P><LI>On the Tools menu, click References to display the References dialog
   box.

<P><LI>The References dialog box shows all object libraries and
   projects registered with the operating system. Scroll through
   the list for the project you want to reference. If the
   template or document project isn't listed, you can use the
   Browse button to search *.dot or *.doc files. References
   whose check boxes are selected are used by your project; those
   that aren't selected are not used, but can be added.

<P><LI>Select the Project reference in the Available References box
   in the References dialog box and click OK.
<P>
   NOTE: If a project has not been saved, it appears as "UNSAVED:
   &lt;Project Name&gt;" and you will be unable to make a reference to it.
<P>
</OL>For more information about adding references, click the Office Assistant,
while in the Visual Basic Editor, type "Adding References," click Search,
and then click to view "Check or Add an Object Library Reference."
<P>
NOTE: If the Assistant is hidden, click the Office Assistant button on the
Standard toolbar. If the Assistant is not able to answer your query, please
see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
