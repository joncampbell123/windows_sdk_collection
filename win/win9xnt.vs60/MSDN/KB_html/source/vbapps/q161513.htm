The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, versions 7.0, 7.0a

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, there is no built-in command that automatically
attaches text labels to data points in an xy (scatter) chart. However, you
can create a Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications macro that does this. 
This article contains a sample macro that performs this task.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>

language being demonstrated and the tools used to create and debug
procedures. Microsoft support engineers can help explain the functionality
of a particular procedure, but they will not modify these examples to
provide added functionality or construct procedures to meet your specific
needs. If you have limited programming experience, you may want to contact

<PRE>   <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/support/supportnet/refguide/default.asp">http://www.microsoft.com/support/supportnet/refguide/default.asp</A></B>

</PRE><h3>Sample Data</h3>
 
<P>
The code example in this article assumes that data and associated labels
are arranged on a worksheet in the following format:

<UL><LI>The first column contains the data labels.
<LI>The second column contains the x values for the xy (scatter) chart.
<LI>The third and subsequent columns contains the y values for the xy
   (scatter) chart.
<P>
</UL>NOTE: Although the example provided only contains one column of data for
y values, you can use more than one series of data.
<P>
To use the macros in this article, create a chart using the following data,
and then use the appropriate steps:
<P>
<PRE>   A1: Labels       B1: X Values   C1: Y Values
   A2: DataPoint1   B2: 2          C2: 5
   A3: DataPoint2   B3: 9          C3: 7
   A4: DataPoint3   B4: 5          C4: 3
   A5: DataPoint4   B5: 4          C5: 8
   A6: DataPoint5   B6: 1          C6: 4

</PRE>NOTE: The table should not contain empty columns, and the column that
contains the data labels should not be separated from the column that
contains the x values. The labels and values must be laid out EXACTLY in
the format described in this article. (The upper-left cell does not have to
be cell A1.)
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Excel 97 and Microsoft Excel 98</h3>
 
<P>
To attach text labels to data points in an xy (scatter) chart in Excel 97 
and Excel 98, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the worksheet that contains the sample data, select the cell range
    B1:C6, and then click Chart on the Insert menu.

<P><LI>In the "Chart Wizard - Step 1 of 4" dialog box, click the Standard 
    Types tab. Under Chart Type, click XY (Scatter), and then click Next.

<P><LI>In the "Chart Wizard - Step 2 of 4" dialog box, click the Data Range 
    tab. Under Series In, click Columns, and then click Next.

<P><LI>In the "Chart Wizard - Step 3 of 4" dialog box, click Next.

<P><LI>In the "Chart Wizard - Step 4 of 4" dialog box, click As New Sheet, and
    then click Finish.

<P><LI>Press ALT+F11 to start the Visual Basic Editor.

<P><LI>On the Insert menu, click Module. Type the sample code found in the     
    "Sample Visual Basic Code" section of this article.

<P><LI>Press ALT+Q to return to Microsoft Excel.

<P><LI>Switch to the chart sheet.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, point to Macro, and then click Macros. Click the
    AttachLabelsToPoints macro, and then click Run to run the macro.
<P>
    The macro attaches the labels in cells A2:A6 to the data points on the
    chart.
<P>
</OL><h3>Microsoft Excel 5.0 or 7.0</h3>
 
<P>
To attach text labels to data points in an xy (scatter) chart in Microsoft
Excel 5.0 or 7.0, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the worksheet that contains the sample data, select the cell range
   B1:C6. On the Insert menu, point to Chart, and then click As New Sheet.

<P><LI>In the "Chart Wizard - Step 1 of 5" dialog box, click Next.

<P><LI>In the "Chart Wizard - Step 2 of 5" dialog box, click XY (Scatter), and
   then click Next.

<P><LI>In the "Chart Wizard - Step 3 of 5" dialog box, click Next.

<P><LI>In the "Chart Wizard - Step 4 of 5" dialog box, select the following
   options:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Data Series in: Columns
      Use First 1 Column(s) for X Data
      Use First 1 Row(s) for Legend Text
</PRE><P>
   and then click Finish.

<P><LI>On the Insert menu, point to Macro, and then click Module. In the 
   module, type the macro in the "Sample Visual Basic Code" section of this 
   article.

<P><LI>Switch to the chart sheet.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Macro. Click the AttachLabelsToPoints macro, 
   and then click Run to run the macro.
<P>
   The macro attaches the labels in cells A2:A6 to the data points on the
   chart.
