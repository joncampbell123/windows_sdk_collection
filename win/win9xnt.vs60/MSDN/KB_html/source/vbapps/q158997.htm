The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run a Visual Basic for Applications macro in Microsoft Excel 97,
you may receive one of the following error messages:
<P>
<PRE>   Run-time error '-2147221080 (800401a8)':
   Automation error

   -or-

   Run-time error '-2147221080 (800401a8)':
   Method 'Name' of object '_Worksheet' failed

   -or-

   Run-time error '424':
   Object required

</PRE>If you click Debug to check the value of a variable in the Immediate 
window, you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down.
   If the problem persists, contact the program vendor.

</PRE>If you click Details, you receive an error message similar to the 
following:
<P>
<PRE>   EXCEL caused an invalid page fault in module VBA332.DLL at
   014f:651b5717.

</PRE>and Microsoft Excel 97 stops responding.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when all of the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>In a Visual Basic macro, you create a variable of type Worksheet or
   Object that refers to a worksheet within a workbook.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>The sheet to which the variable refers is deleted or moved to another
   workbook.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>You attempt to check any property of the variable.
<P>
</UL>NOTE: If you click the Debug button in the error message dialog box, click
the Immediate window in the Visual Basic Editor, and then attempt to use
the variable in question, an invalid page fault occurs. Or, a page fault
occurs when you position the pointer over any section of code that refers
to the variable in question in the Code window.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft provides examples of Visual Basic for Applications procedures for

but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and/or fitness
for a particular purpose. The Visual Basic procedures in this article are
provided 'as is' and Microsoft does not guarantee that they can be used in
all situations. While Microsoft support engineers can help explain the
functionality of a particular macro, they will not modify these examples to
provide added functionality, nor will they help you construct macros to
meet your specific needs. If you have limited programming experience, you
may want to consult one of the Microsoft Solution Providers. Solution
Providers offer a wide range of fee-based services, including creating
custom macros. For more information about Microsoft Solution Providers,

<P>
The following macro moves Sheet1 from the active workbook into a new
workbook:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub Test()

       Dim xSheet As Worksheet, newWorkbook As Workbook
       Set xSheet = ThisWorkbook.Sheets("Sheet1")
       Set newWorkbook = Workbooks.Add
       xSheet.Move Before:=newWorkbook.Sheets(1)
       MsgBox xSheet.Name

   End Sub

</PRE>If you attempt to check the value of xSheet after moving the sheet to the
new workbook, the error appears. For example, the following line of code
fails because xSheet refers to a worksheet that no longer exists in the
same workbook:
<P>
<PRE>   MsgBox xSheet.Name

</PRE>To work around this problem, redefine the variable to point to the new
location of the sheet. Or, set the value of the variable equal to Nothing.
To do this, use either of the following methods:
<P>
Method 1: Set the Variable to Point to the New Location of the Worksheet
<P>
<PRE>             'Because xSheet is now the first sheet in the new workbook,
             'redefine the variable appropriately.
             Set xSheet = newWorkbook.Sheets(1)

             'This line of code now works correctly.
             MsgBox xSheet.Name

</PRE>Method 2: Set XSheet Equal to Nothing
<P>
<PRE>             Set xSheet = Nothing

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In earlier versions of Microsoft Excel, if you create a variable that
refers to a sheet, and then move that sheet to another workbook, the
variable continues to find to the sheet in its new location. For example if
you run the following subroutine in Microsoft Excel 5.0 or 7.0, the MsgBox
displays the name of the moved sheet ("Sheet1 (2)") even when you move the
worksheet to a different workbook:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub MoveSheet()

       Dim xSheet As Object, newWorkbook As Object
       Set xSheet = ThisWorkbook.Sheets(1)
       Set newWorkbook = Workbooks.Add
       xSheet.Move Before:=newWorkbook.Sheets(1)
       MsgBox xSheet.Name

   End Sub

</PRE>In Microsoft Excel 97, this macro does not work correctly, because the
variable xSheet cannot find the moved sheet in its new location. This
change in behavior may cause problems if your code assumes that the
variable continues to refer to the sheet even if it is moved. In this case,
use the first method to redefine the variable to refer to the sheet in the
new location.
