<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In Visual Basic for Applications, an object represents an element of an
application, such as a document, a paragraph, a sentence, a word, or a
field.
<P>
A collection is an object that contains several other objects, usually,
but not always, of the same type. In Microsoft Word, for example, the
Documents Collection object contains all the open Document objects.
<P>
At times it may be necessary when you write Visual Basic for Applications
macros to return the number of objects within a particular collection of
objects.
<P>
This article discusses methods that can be used to return the count of a
collection of objects for part or all of a document including but not
limited to objects located in headers, footers, and different sections of a
document.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>

<P><h3>Method 1: To Return a Count of Objects for an Entire Document</h3>
 
<P>
To return a count of objects for an entire document including those
contained in headers, footers, comments, endnotes, footnotes and text
frames use the StoryRanges Collection object.
<P>
A Story object is contained within the Story Collection. Members of the
Story collection are
<P>
- The Main Text or Body of a Document
<P>
- First Page Header
<P>
- First Page Footer
<P>
- Primary Header
<P>
- Primary Footer
<P>
- Even Pages Headers
<P>
- Even Pages Footers
<P>
- Comments
<P>
- EndNotes
<P>
- Footnotes
<P>
- Text Frames
<P>
For example, to count the number of fields in all stories of a document,
use the following example:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub CountAllFields()
      Dim iCount As Integer
      Dim aStory As Object
      For Each aStory In ActiveDocument.StoryRanges
         iCount = iCount + aStory.Fields.Count
      Next
      MsgBox iCount
   End Sub

</PRE>To count the number of Shapes(Drawing Objects) in all stories of a
document, use the following example:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub CountAllShapes()
      Dim iCount As Integer
      Dim aStory As Object
      For Each aStory In ActiveDocument.StoryRanges
         iCount = iCount + aStory.Application.ActiveDocument.Shapes.Count
      Next
      MsgBox iCount
   End Sub

</PRE>To count the number of Hyperlinks in all stories of a document, use the
following example:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub CountAllHyperLinks()
      Dim iCount As Integer
      Dim aStory As Object
      For Each aStory In ActiveDocument.StoryRanges
         iCount = iCount + _
         aStory.Application.ActiveDocument.Hyperlinks.Count
      Next
      MsgBox iCount
   End Sub

</PRE><h3>Method 2: To Return a Count of Objects for Part of a Document</h3>
 
<P>
To return a count of items for a single member of the StoryRange, specify a
member of the story range with a wdStoryType constant.
<P>
In this example, the wdMainTextStory constant is used in conjunction with
the Paragraphs collection to return the count of paragraphs in the main
text or body of a document:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub CountParagraphs()
      MsgBox ActiveDocument.StoryRanges(wdMainTextStory).Paragraphs.Count
   End Sub

</PRE>In this example, the wdMainTextStory constant is used in conjunction with
the Sentences Collection to return the count of sentences in the main body
of a document:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub CountSentencesInMainDocBody()
      Dim MyStory As Object
      Set MyStory = ActiveDocument.StoryRanges(wdMainTextStory)
      MsgBox MyStory.Sentences.Count
   End Sub

</PRE>For more information about StoryRanges, from the Visual Basic for
Applications Editor, click the Office Assistant, type "story," click
Search, and then click to view "StoryRanges Collection Object."
