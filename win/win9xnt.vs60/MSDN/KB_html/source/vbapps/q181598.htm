<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multi-user skills.
<P>
The colors of a chart can be changed dynamically to correspond with the
data in the current record of the form or report or to reflect special
conditions of the data. During the OnCurrent, OnFormat, and OnPrint events,
the data displayed in a chart is not normally synchronized with the data in
the current record of the form or report. Because you must use a Visual
Basic for Applications procedure to clear and reload the data of a chart
every time one of these events occurs, you can use the same procedure to
change the colors of each data point on the graph.

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following example demonstrates how to create a chart whose colors are
dynamic.
<P>
CAUTION: Following the steps in this example will modify the sample
database Northwind.mdb. You may want to back up the Northwind.mdb file
and perform these steps on a copy of the database.
<P>
<P><h3>Modify the Query Product Sales for 1995</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start Microsoft Access and open the query "Product Sales for 1995" in
   the sample database Northwind.mdb.

<P><LI>Add the Shippers table to the query. Microsoft Access automatically
   creates a join between the ShipVia field in the Orders table and the
   ShipperID field in the Shippers table.

<P><LI>Drag the CompanyName field from the Shippers table to the first empty
   column on the query design grid. Leave the Total row for this field set
   to the default value of Group By.

<P><LI>Save and close the query.
<P>
</OL><h3>Create the Chart</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create a new form based on the Categories table. Include only the
    CategoryID and CategoryName fields in the detail section of the form.

<P><LI>On the Insert menu, click Chart to create a chart in the detail
    section of the form.

<P><LI>In the first screen of the Chart Wizard, click Queries and select
    Product Sales for 1995. Click Next.

<P><LI>Move the CompanyName field from the Available Fields list to the Fields
    for Chart list. Then move the ProductSales field from the Available
    Fields list to the Fields for Chart list. Click Next.

<P><LI>Click Next in the chart type screen to select the default type of
    Column Chart.

<P><LI>In the layout screen of the Chart Wizard, click Next.

<P><LI>Click OK if you receive the following message
<P>
       You must add field CategoryID if you want to use this link.

<P><LI>In the Form Fields list, click CategoryName; in the Chart Fields list,
    click CategoryName, and then click Finish.

<P><LI>On the View menu, click Properties and change the Name property of the
    chart to "chtColorChart" (without the quotation marks).

<P><LI>Save the form as frmChartColors and switch to Form view. Notice that
    the columns corresponding to each of the three shippers are all the
    same color.
<P>
</OL><h3>Create the Event Procedure</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Open frmChartColors in Design view, and on the View menu, click Code.

<P><LI>Type the following lines in the Declarations section of the class
   module:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Option Compare Database
      Option Explicit
      Option Base 1
</PRE><P>
   Note that the first two lines may already be present in the
   Declarations section.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, click References.

<P><LI>In the References dialog box, scroll down the Available References list
   and select the Microsoft Graph 8.0 Object Library. Click OK, and then
   close the module.

<P><LI>On the Edit menu, click Select Form; then, Click Properties on the View
   menu to open the property sheet of the form.

<P><LI>Click the OnCurrent property box, and then click the Build (...)
   button. In the Choose Builder dialog box, click Code Builder, and then
   click OK.

<P><LI>Set the form's OnCurrent property to the following event procedure:
<P>
<P><PRE>       Private Sub Form_Current()
