<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you open a Microsoft Excel workbook in Microsoft Internet Explorer,
you may receive one or more of the following error messages:
<P>
<PRE>   Run-time error '-2147467259 (80004005)':
   Operation cannot be performed when the application is inactive.

   -or-

   Microsoft Excel is waiting for another application to complete an OLE
   action.

   -or-

   EXCEL caused an invalid page fault in module KERNEL32.DLL at
   014f:bff9a141.

   -or-

   EXCEL caused an invalid page fault in module VBA332.DLL at
   014f:65155893.

</PRE>and Microsoft Internet Explorer stops responding.
<P>
Or, when you click "Add From File" on the Section menu in Microsoft Office
Binder 97 and add a Microsoft Excel workbook to a binder, Microsoft Office
Binder 97 stops responding.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This will occur if the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>The workbook contains a Workbook_Open macro.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -and-
</PRE>
<LI>The Workbook_Open macro contains a command to make the Office
   Assistant window visible.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -and-
</PRE>
<LI>Microsoft Excel 97 is not currently running.
<P>
</UL><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>

<P>
If this problem occurs, you can use the OnTime method to delay making the
Office Assistant visible. By delaying the process, you can prevent the
problem from occurring.
<P>
To do this, follow the steps below:

<OL><P><LI>In the Visual Basic Editor, activate the ThisWorkbook (Code) window.
   (In the Project Explorer window, click ThisWorkbook and then click
   Code on the View menu.)

<P><LI>In the ThisWorkbook (Code) window, enter the following code:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub Workbook_Open()
      Application.OnTime Now + TimeValue("00:00:15"), "ShowAssistant"
   End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>Click Module on the Insert menu.

<P><LI>In this module sheet, enter the following code:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub ShowAssistant()
      Application.Assistant.Visible = True
   End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>Save and close your file.
<P>
</OL>The next time you open this file from Microsoft Internet Explorer or
Microsoft Binder, the Assistant will display correctly.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 97, workbooks can contain a "Workbook_Open" macro. This
macro is stored in the ThisWorkbook (Code) window for a workbook and runs
automatically when the workbook is opened.
<P>
If a Workbook_Open macro contains a command to display the Office Assistant
window:
<P>
<PRE>   Application.Assistant.Visible = True

</PRE></OL>the workbook will not open correctly in either Microsoft Internet Explorer
or Microsoft Office Binder 97, if Microsoft Excel 97 is not already
running.
