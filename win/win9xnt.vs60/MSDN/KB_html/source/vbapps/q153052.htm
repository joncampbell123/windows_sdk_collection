The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access versions 2.0, 7.0
</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
When you print a column report, it is sometimes necessary to display a
label for each row of detail being printed within the column. However, when
the report is a multicolumn report, this will cause each new column in the
multicolumn report to redisplay these labels.
<P>
Microsoft Access does not contain a report option which enables the
printing of labels only along the left margin of a report. A report which
requires this type of output would require modifications by the user of the
report.
<P>
This article describes how to modify a report so that when a multicolumn
report is printed, the labels for each row of information in the columns
will be printed only down the left margin of the report.
<P>
This article assumes that you are familiar with Visual Basic for
Applications and with creating Microsoft Access applications using the
programming tools provided with Microsoft Access. For more information
about Visual Basic for Applications, please refer to the "Building
Applications with Microsoft Access for Windows 95" manual.
<P>
NOTE: Visual Basic for Applications (used in Microsoft Access version 7.0)
is called Access Basic in version 2.0. For more information about Access
Basic, please refer to the "Building Applications" manual.

To display labels on the left margin of a multicolumn report, follow these
steps:

<OL><P><LI>Open the sample database Northwind.mdb (or NWIND.MDB in version 2.0).

<P><LI>Create a new Report based on the Customers table in Design View.

<P><LI>Add 11 text boxes without labels to the left margin of the Detail
    section, beginning with the first text box in the upper-left corner. As
    you add each new text box, place it directly under the last text box.
<P>
    NOTE: To avoid the automatic creation of labels with each new text box,
    click the Text Box button on the toolbox. On the View menu, click
    Properties, and set the AutoLabel property to No.

<P><LI>Set the Width property for each text box to 2".

<P><LI>Set the Name property of the first text box to txt1, the Name property
    of the second text box to txt2, and so on.

<P><LI>Click the ControlSource property for the txt1 text box and set the
    property to the first field name in the list. Click the ControlSource
    property for the txt2 text box and set the property to the second field
    name in the list. Continue this process for all 11 text boxes.

<P><LI>To the right of each text box, create a label. As each new label is
    created, in the label, type the name of the field which appears in the
    text box that is to the left of the new label.

<P><LI>Set the Name property of the first label to lbl1, the Name property of
    the second label to lbl2, and so on.

<P><LI>Set the Width property of each label to 2".

<P><LI>Drag the lbl1 label directly over top of the txt1 text box, and the
    lbl2 label directly over top of the txt2 text box, and so on.

<P><LI>Set the Width property of the report to 2" and the Height property of
    the Detail Section to 3".

<P><LI>Click Page Setup (for Microsoft Access 2.0, click Print Setup) on the
    File menu and set all margins to 0.5".

<P><LI>Set Orientation to Landscape (for Microsoft Access 7.0, first click the
    Page tab).

<P><LI>Click the Layout tab (for Microsoft Access 2.0, click More) and set
    Items Across to 4, set Layout Items to "Across, then Down" (for
    Microsoft Access 2.0, set Item Layout to Horizontal), and then click
    OK.

<P><LI>Add the following code to the Detail section's OnFormat Event property:
<P>
       Dim i As Integer
       If Me.Left &lt;Me.Width Then
<PRE>           Me.NextRecord = False
           For i = 1 To 11
               Me("txt" &amp; i).Visible = False
               Me("lbl" &amp; i).Visible = True
           Next i
       Else
           For i = 1 To 11
               Me("txt" &amp; i).Visible = True
               Me("lbl" &amp; i).Visible = False
           Next i
      End If

</PRE><P><LI>After closing the Module window, on the File menu, click Save, save the
    report as Report1, and then click Print Preview.
<P>
    NOTE: The Width and Height property values used throughout this example
    can and will vary from report to report.
