<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
With PowerPoint 97 you can create macros to automate tasks you perform
repeatedly. A macro is basically a list of commands for PowerPoint to
perform.
<P>
One method to create a macro is to record the commands using the PowerPoint
built-in macro recorder. This introductory article includes the steps to
record, run, and delete macros.
<P>
This article also contains some information on where macros are stored and
some limitations of macros created using the macro recorder.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Record a Macro</h3>
 
<P>
Follow these steps to record a macro with PowerPoint 97:

<OL><P><LI>Open or create a PowerPoint Presentation. You cannot record a macro
   unless a presentation is open.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, point to Macro, and then click Record New Macro.
   This opens the Record Macro dialog box.
<P>
   NOTE: If you are currently recording a macro, you see the Stop
   Recording menu choice instead of the Record New Macro option.

<P><LI>In the Macro name box, enter a name for your macro. The default macro
   name is the word Macro followed by a number. The name must begin with
   a letter and can contain up to 80 letters. The name cannot contain
   any spaces. Visual Basic for Applications keywords are invalid names
   for macros.
<P>
   Don't worry about trying to remember all the rules for naming macros.
   If you enter an invalid macro name, PowerPoint 97 displays a dialog
   box with a message similar to the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      &lt;macro name&gt; is not a valid name for a macro
</PRE>
<P><LI>Use the Store Macro In drop down list to select the location in which
   to save your macro. The default location is the active presentation.
   Normally, you would save macros within presentations.

<P><LI>Use the Description box to type a description of what your macro does.
   The description is important. Once you build up a collection of macros
   without descriptions, it may be very difficult to determine what any
   particular macro does.

<P><LI>Once you have the Record Macro settings configured, click OK. This
   brings up the Stop Recording command bar. The command bar contains one
   square button. This button is used to stop the macro from recording.

<P><LI>Carry out the actions you want to record.
<P>
   NOTE: Some actions may not be recorded by the macro recorder.
   PowerPoint records a command only when an equivalent Visual Basic for
   Applications command exists within PowerPoint's object model. The
   object model is a set of commands that you can use to control
   PowerPoint.

<P><LI>When done with the actions, stop recording the macro. You can do this
   in two ways:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Click the square button located on the Stop Recording command bar.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      -or-
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - On the Tools menu, point to Macro, and then click Stop Recording.
</PRE><P>
</OL><h3>Run a Macro</h3>
 
<P>
After you have created a macro, you'll want to run it. Use the following
steps to run a macro within PowerPoint 97:

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, point to Macro, and then click Macros. The Macro
   dialog box appears.

<P><LI>Click a macro from the list of available macros. If you do not see your
   macro listed, one of two things may be happening:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - The presentation where the macro resides is not open. Open the
      presentation that contains your macro and try again.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - A presentation that does not contain your macro is selected on
      the Macro In drop down list. Click the drop down menu to view a
      list of open presentations. Select the presentation that contains
      your macro and try again.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      NOTE: You can select the All open presentations option to view all
      the macros currently available.
</PRE>
<P><LI>With the macro you wish to run highlighted, click the run button.
<P>
</OL><h3>Where Macros Are Stored</h3>
 
<P>
Macros created within PowerPoint 97 are typically stored within
PowerPoint presentations. When you save your file as a PowerPoint 97
presentation, your macro is saved along with it.
<P>
When you open a presentation that contains macros, if Macro Virus
Protection is enabled, a warning dialog box is displayed. This dialog
gives you the option to enable or disable the macros that reside within
the presentation you are about to open.
<P>
For more information about macro viruses, search the Help Index for
"virus protection," or ask the Microsoft PowerPoint 97 Office Assistant.
<P>
<P><h3>How to Delete a Macro</h3>
 
<P>
Follow these steps to delete a macro from a PowerPoint presentation:

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, point to Macro, and then click Macros. This brings
   up the Macro dialog box.

<P><LI>Click the macro you wish to delete.

<P><LI>Click the Delete button.

<P><LI>PowerPoint displays a dialog box similar to the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Are you sure you want to delete the macro &lt;macro name&gt;?
</PRE><P>
   Click Yes to delete the macro.
<P>
</OL><h3>Limitations of Recorded Macros</h3>
 
<P>
Not all features in PowerPoint can be recorded. PowerPoint records a
command only when an equivalent Visual Basic for Applications command
exists within PowerPoint's object model. The object model is basically
a set of commands that you can use to control PowerPoint.
<P>
PowerPoint suspends its recording of commands when you switch to a
different application. When you return, PowerPoint picks up where it
left off and continues to record commands.
<P>
For more information about the limitations of recorded macros, please see
