<P>
In the products listed at the beginning of this article, the spinner 
control that is on the Forms toolbar has a minimum value of zero. This
article includes a Microsoft Excel Visual Basic for Applications macro
example that demonstrates how you can use a spinner control that appears to
allow negative numbers.

</PRE>In the following example, you create a spinner control that appears to have
a minimum value of -10 and a maximum value of 10. The spinner control 
stores its result in cell A1.

<OL><P><LI>Create a new workbook.

<P><LI>Right-click (or CONTROL-click) the toolbar area in Microsoft Excel.
   Click Forms on the menu to display the Forms toolbar.

<P><LI>Click the spinner control on the Forms toolbar and draw the spinner
   control next to cell A1 on your worksheet.

<P><LI>Double-click the spinner control to display the Format Object dialog
   box. Click the Control tab. Type a Minimum Value of "0" (without the
   quotation marks) and a Maximum Value of "20" (without the quotation
   marks), and click OK.
<P>
   NOTE: You set the Maximum to 20 because the difference between the
   minimum and the maximum values that you want to use is 20 (that is,
   10-(-10)=20).

<P><LI>Right-click (or CONTROL-click) the spinner control and click Assign
   Macro.

<P><LI>Click New in the Assign Macro dialog box.

<P><LI>Type the following macro in the module:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Const Diff = 10
</PRE><P>
<PRE>      Sub Spinner1_Change()
          Range("A1").Value = _
              ActiveSheet.Spinners("Spinner 1").Value - Diff
      End Sub

   NOTE: The constant Diff is equal to the difference between 0 and the
   minimum value that you want to use (that is, 0-(-10) = 10).

</PRE><P><LI>Activate the worksheet that contains the spinner control. Select cell
   A1. Test the spinner control by clicking it. You should see values in
   cell A1 that range between -10 and 10.
