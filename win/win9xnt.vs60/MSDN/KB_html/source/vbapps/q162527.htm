The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the Visual Basic for Applications StoryRanges collection to
return a word count for comments, as in the following example
<P>
<PRE>   x = ActiveDocument.StoryRanges(wdCommentsStory).Words.Count

</PRE>you may not receive the results you expect.
<P>
For example, if the author name for a comment is two words long and the
comment contains four words, the total word count returned is 6 (instead
of 4 as expected).
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The number of words returned includes the names of the commenting authors.
<P>
In addition, this count is cumulative. That is, if there are two comments
in a document, the number of words in the comment author's name will be
counted for each comment. For example, if each comment contains 4 words
and
John Doe is the author of both comments, the total word count returned is
12 instead of 8 as expected.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
The following example will return the number of words found in all
comments in a document, but will exclude the number of words in the
comment author's name:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub CountWordsInAllComments()
      Dim oComment As Object
      Dim iWordCount As Long
      For Each oComment In ActiveDocument.Comments
         iWordCount = iWordCount + oComment.Range.Words.Count
      Next
      MsgBox iWordCount
   End Sub
