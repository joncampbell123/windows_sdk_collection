The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, version 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, the results you get when you use the STDEV() function
may vary depending on the order in which you enter the values. This
behavior is incorrect: the results of this function should not depend on
the order in which you enter the values.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The process used to calculate the standard deviation involves the
subtraction of two values that may be very similar to each other. The
numbers may be calculated incorrectly because the two numbers may be
rounded incorrectly. This incorrect rounding occurs because of the way a
computer stores and manipulates numbers.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, round the data when you calculate the
standard deviation.
<P>
The following is a sample Visual Basic function that you can use to round
the data as you calculate the standard deviation.
<P>

<P><h3>Visual Basic Example</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>In a new Visual Basic module, enter the following macro code:
<P>
<PRE>   'Rounded_Stdev function to calculate the rounded standard deviation

   ' Define the Rounded_StDev function with a data type of Double.
   ' This data type is consistent with type that Microsoft Excel uses.

   Function Rounded_Stdev(x_values As Variant) As Double

     'Dimension memory for variables
     Dim n As Integer
     Dim sum_of_x As Double, sum_of_x_squared As Double

     'Initialize variables before For Each loop
     sum_of_x = 0
     sum_of_x_squared = 0

     'calculates count of x_values
     n = x_values.Count

     For Each cell In x_values
        sum_of_x = sum_of_x + cell.Value
        sum_of_x_squared = sum_of_x_squared + cell.Value ^ 2
     Next

     'Perform math necessary to calculate standard deviation.
     Rounded_Stdev = n * sum_of_x_squared - sum_of_x ^ 2

     'Round at this step to remove any possible mathematical discrepancies.
     Rounded_Stdev = Application.Round(Rounded_Stdev, 14)

     'Continue to perform math necessary to calculate standard deviation.
     Rounded_Stdev = Rounded_Stdev / (n * (n - 1))
     Rounded_Stdev = Rounded_Stdev ^ 0.5

   End Function

</PRE><P><LI>Select a cell in the worksheet on which you want the results of the
   STDEV() function to appear, and choose the Function Wizard button.

<P><LI>In the Function Wizard dialog box, under Function Category, select the
   User Defined category. Under function name, select Rounded_Stdev, and
   then choose the Next button.

<P><LI>In the Function Wizard--Step 2 of 2 dialog box, in the x_values box,
   enter the range that contains the values for which you want to calculate
   the standard deviation (you can enter these values by selecting them in
   the worksheet).

<P><LI>Choose the Finish button.
