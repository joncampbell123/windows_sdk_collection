<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Query, to use concatenated variables, and to know where and
how to break a line of code for Line Continuation, you need to know how
dynamic data exchange (DDE) to Microsoft Query statements are formatted.
This article provides an understanding of the rules governing manipulation 
of the DDE to Microsoft Query statements.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>

the following page on the World Wide Web:
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/support/supportnet/refguide/default.asp">http://www.microsoft.com/support/supportnet/refguide/default.asp</A></B>

</PRE>For example, consider the following line of DDE to Microsoft Query code:
<P>
<PRE>   DDEExecute Chan, "[UserControl('&amp;Return to Excel',3)]"

</PRE>In this example, note the following:

<UL><LI>Everything within the outer quotation marks is a Visual Basic for
   Applications text string to be passed to the DDE Channel.

<LI>Everything within the square brackets is passed across the DDE
   channel to Microsoft Query.

<LI>Everything within the parentheses is a Microsoft Query function
   argument and must match the Query function's requirements.

<LI>Everything within the apostrophes is a string to Microsoft Query.
<P>
</UL>When you "break" a DDE to Microsoft Query statement for Concatenation, it 
is critical to preserve any apostrophes that are present. The following are 
two methods you can use to do this:
<P>
<P><h3>Concatenation Method 1: Leave the Apostrophes Within the Quotation Marks</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Before you can break a line inside a Visual Basic for Applications
   text string (within the outer quotation marks), you must "wrap" each
   section of the text string in quotation marks, removing the text that
   will be replaced by the concatenated variable.
<P>
   In the following example, the apostrophes are preserved within the
   string text:
<P>
<P><PRE>      DDEExecute Chan, "[UserControl('" &lt;break&gt; "',3)]"
</PRE>
<P><LI>Load the variable with the data to be concatenated, as illustrated
   below:
<P>
<P><PRE>      X = "&amp;Return to Excel"
</PRE>
<P><LI>At the point in the string where you need to insert the concatenation
   variable, use a concatenation character sequence (&lt;space&gt;&amp;&lt;space&gt;) on
   both sides of the inserted variable, as in the following example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      DDEExecute Chan, "[UserControl('" &amp; X &amp; "',3)]"
</PRE><P>
</OL><h3>Concatenation Method 2: Preserve the Apostrophes Within the Variable</h3>
 
<P>
To do this, perform the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Before you can break a line inside a Visual Basic for Applications
   text string (within the outer quotation marks), you must "wrap" each
   section of the text string in quotation marks, and remove the text
   that will be replaced by the concatenated variable.
<P>
   If this option is used, the example would look like the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      DDEExecute Chan, "[UserControl(" &lt;break&gt; ",3)]"
</PRE>
<P><LI>Load the variable with the data to be concatenated. Note that in this
   case the apostrophes are included in the variable. See the following
   example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      X = "'&amp;Return to Excel'"
</PRE>
<P><LI>At the point in the string where you need to insert the concatenation
   variable, use a concatenation character sequence (&lt;space&gt;&amp;&lt;space&gt;) on
   both sides of the inserted variable. Note that the apostrophes are
   NOT included in the statement, as illustrated below:
<P>
<P><PRE>      DDEExecute Chan, "[UserControl(" &amp; X &amp; ",3)]"
</PRE><P>
</OL><h3>Line Continuation Example</h3>
 
<P>
When you "break" a DDE to Microsoft Query statement for Line Continuation, 
use the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Before you can break a line inside a Visual Basic for Applications
   text string (within the outer  quotation marks), you must "wrap" both
   sections of the text string in quotation marks. See the following
   example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      DDEExecute Chan, "[UserControl('&amp;Re" &lt;break&gt; "turn to Excel',3)]"
</PRE>
<P><LI>At the point in the string where the break is to occur, use a
   concatenation character sequence (&lt;space&gt;&amp;&lt;space&gt;) between each text
   string, as in this example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      DDEExecute Chan, "[UserControl('&amp;Re" &amp; "turn to Excel',3)]"
</PRE>
<P><LI>Add the line continuation character &lt;_&gt;, as in the following example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      DDEExecute Chan, "[UserControl('&amp;Re" &amp; _
<PRE></PRE>          "turn to Excel',3)]"

</PRE></OL><h3>Statement Formatting Example</h3>
 
<P>
When you concatenate variables, the format of the data used must match that 
which is required by Microsoft Query.
<P>
For example, when you return data to Microsoft Excel from Microsoft Query 
using DDE, you must address the worksheet range in which you want to place 
the requested data in the R1C1 reference style.
<P>
This example shows how to format the variable "FetchLoc" in the R1C1
reference style, as required by Microsoft Query:
<P>
<PRE>   FetchLoc = fetchdata.Address(referenceStyle:=xlR1C1) _
       &amp; ":" &amp; fetchdata.Offset(NumRows(1), _
       NumCols(1)).Address(referenceStyle:=xlR1C1)

</PRE>The variable "FetchLoc" can now be concatenated in the DDE to Microsoft
Query statement, as in the following example:
<P>
NOTE: Remember to retain the apostrophes.
<P>
<PRE>   DDEExecute Chan, ("[Fetch('Excel','Sheet1','" &amp; _
       FetchLoc &amp; "','All/Headers')]")
</PRE>
