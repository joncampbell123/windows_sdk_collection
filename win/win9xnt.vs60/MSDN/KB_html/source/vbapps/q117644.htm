<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, if you are using the Visual Basic, Applications Edition 
SQLRetrieve command, and you want each column of results to be declared as 
a named range on the worksheet, you can set the "NamedRngLogical" argument 
to TRUE.
<P>
The name of each range is the field name of a column's result set. The
syntax for the SQLRetrieve statement is as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   SQLRetrieve(ConnectionNum, DestinationRef, MaxColumns, MaxRows,
     ColNamesLogical, RowNumsLogical, NamedRngLogical,
     FetchFirstLogical)

</PRE>When you execute the SQLRetrieve command with the argument 
"NamedRngLogical" set to TRUE, the column names in the result set will
always be defined on the active workbook regardless of what the
"DestinationRef" argument is set to. If no workbooks are active when you
run the SQLRetrieve command, and if "NamedRngLogical" is set to TRUE, you
will receive the #N/A error value; however, the records will still be
retrieved to the range specified by destination.
<P>
NOTE: The information in this article also applies to the Microsoft
Excel 4.0 command SQL.EXEC.QUERY.

</PRE>Note that a line that is preceded by an apostrophe introduces a comment in 
the code--comments are provided to explain what the code is doing at a 
particular point in the procedure. Note also that an underscore character 
(_) indicates that code continues from one line to the next. You can type 
lines that contain this character as one logical line or you can divide the 
lines of code and include the line continuation character. For more

"Programming Style in This Manual" section in the "Document Conventions" 
section of the "Visual Basic User's Guide."
<P>
The following sample Visual Basic code uses the CUSTOMER.DBF file included
with the sample data source NWind and assumes that:

<OL><P><LI>The NWind ODBC driver is installed and points to the Windows or a shared
   MSAPPS\MSQUERY directory.

<P><LI>The module sheet has references to XLODBC.XLA found in the
   EXCEL\LIBRARY\MSQUERY directory, under the TOOLS-REFERENCES menu.
<P>
</OL>To run the example, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>In a new module sheet, enter in the following code:
<P>
<PRE>      Sub GetData()

         ' To define the ranges for the column names in the workbook to 
         ' which the data is returned, use the following macro:

         Dim DestRange As Object
         Dim Chan, NumCols, NumRows As Variant
         Dim i As Integer

         Set DestRange = ThisWorkbook.Sheets("Sheet1").Range("A1")

         Chan = SQLOpen("DSN=NWind;FIL=dBase4;")

         ' Enter the following statement on a single line.
         NumCols = SQLExecQuery(Chan, "SELECT customer.CONTACT, " &amp; _
           "customer.COMPANY FROM customer.dbf")

         NumRows = SQLRetrieve(Chan, DestRange, , , True)

         SQLClose(Chan)

         DestRange.Resize(NumRows + 1, NumCols).CreateNames Top:=True, _
            Left:=False

      End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>Switch to a worksheet.

<P><LI>From the Tools menu, choose Macros, and then select the GetData macro.
