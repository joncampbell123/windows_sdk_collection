</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run a macro in a Microsoft Excel workbook that is part of a
Microsoft Binder file or that is embedded in a document in another 
program, you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Run-time error '91':
   Object variable or With block variable not set

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when both of the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>The macro line that causes the error uses ActiveCell or ActiveSheet.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>You run the macro from the Visual Basic Editor.
<P>
</UL>NOTE: If you run the macro when the Office Binder window or the other 
program's window is active, you do not receive the error message.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft provides examples of Visual Basic for Applications procedures for
illustration only, without warranty either expressed or implied, including,
but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and/or fitness
for a particular purpose. The Visual Basic procedures in this article are
provided 'as is' and Microsoft does not guarantee that they can be used in
all situations. While Microsoft support engineers can help explain the
functionality of a particular macro, they will not modify these examples to
provide added functionality, nor will they help you construct macros to
meet your specific needs. If you have limited programming experience, you
may want to consult one of the Microsoft Solution Providers. Solution
Providers offer a wide range of fee-based services, including creating
custom macros. For more information about Microsoft Solution Providers,
call Microsoft Customer Information Service at (800) 426-9400.
<P>
To run the macro in the Visual Basic Editor, modify the macro by specifying
the worksheet in which you want to use the ActiveCell or ActiveSheet
property. For example, if the macro contains the following code:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub Test()
       ActiveCell.Value = "my value"
   End Sub

</PRE>modify the macro as shown in the following example:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub Test()
       Thisworkbook.Sheets("Sheet1").Activate
       ActiveCell.Value = "it works"
   End Sub

</PRE>NOTE: You must specify the sheet in which you want to use the ActiveCell
property.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This problem is likely to occur when you record a macro that contains the
ActiveCell property, and you then run the recorded macro from the Visual
Basic Editor.
<P>
When you type text or a number in a cell, the macro recorder uses the
ActiveCell property. The following macro is recorded when you select cell
B1 and type "hello" in the cell:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub Macro1()
       Range("B1").Select
       ActiveCell.FormulaR1C1 = "hello"
       Range("B2").Select
   End Sub
</PRE>
