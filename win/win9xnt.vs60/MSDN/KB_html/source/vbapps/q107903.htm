<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The default value property of an object or an element in an array cannot be 
set with a For Each loop if the loop control variable is a Variant data 
type.
<P>

<PRE>   <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/support/supportnet/refguide/default.asp">http://www.microsoft.com/support/supportnet/refguide/default.asp</A></B>

</PRE>The following macro example uses a For Each loop to concatenate the letter
"A" to the values in a range and then displays the results in a message 
box. The loop counter in this macro is defined with a Variant data type.
When the loop attempts to change the value of the cells in the range by
concatenating the variant loop counter, the routine appears to run properly
and the new value appears in a message box as expected. However, when a
second For Each loop redisplays the values in the range by calling the
variant loop counter, the range values have reverted back to their original
state (the range values no longer have the "A" concatenated to them).
<P>
<P><h3>Macro Example</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   ' In this macro, cellRange is an Object variable
   ' and cellItem is a Variant variable.

   Sub loopTest()

      Set cellRange = ActiveSheet.Range(Selection.Address)

      ' The following Concatenates an "A" to the default value of each 
      ' cell.
      For Each cellItem In cellRange
         cellItem = cellItem &amp; "A"
         MsgBox cellItem
      Next

      ' The cellRange will return the default value (not value&amp;"A"), even 
      ' though the loop above changed the value of the object.
      For Each cellItem In cellRange
         MsgBox "n = " &amp; cellItem
      Next

   End Sub

</PRE>The connection between the object and the variant is broken when the loop
attempts to write to the value property of the object. The result of this
break is that the new value is assigned to the Variant variable, but the
object is not updated. When the first loop references the variant, the
Variant variable passes the value that it is holding (instead of getting
the object's value property) and the loop appears to work. However, when
the second loop references the Variant variable, it is passed the value
that the variable is reading from the object--which was never changed.
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
If you are working with a collection of objects, use an explicit value
property (cellItem.value=cellItem &amp; "A") or use the Dim statement to
declare the control variable as an Object rather than a Variant data type.
<P>
If you are working with an array, there is no workaround: when you use a
For Each loop with an array, you have read-only access. Although you do not
receive an error message if you attempt to write to an array, the array
element will not be written to.
