<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications requires external libraries
to use BSTR values in string-related functions. Therefore, 32-bit Word
add-in libraries (WLLs) or dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) that use LPSTR
values in string-related functions need to be modified and recompiled to
work in Microsoft Word 97.
<P>
The string functions in the ODBC add-in (Wbodbc.wll) have been updated so
that the new version of the add-in contains string-related functions that
do not cause errors when the functions are called from Visual Basic. There
have been no other changes or additions to the functionality of the ODBC
add-in. However, if you've written Word 7.0 solutions that use the ODBC
functions in Wbodbc.wll, you must install the updated version of the WLL to
run your solution in Word 97.
<P>
The template of sample macros that use Wbodbc.wll (WbODBC97.dot) is a Word
97 template. All the macros in this template have been updated to Visual
Basic. You can refer to the sample macros (all of which use data in the
Test.mdb database) as examples for using the functions in Wbodbc.wll.
<P>
For complete information about using the functions in this add-in, running
the macros in the sample template, and handling ODBC data sources in
general, see Appendix B in the Microsoft Word Developer's Kit
(ISBN 1-55615-880-7). Note that this WLL is an update to the 32-bit version
of the ODBC add-in only; the updated WLL cannot be used by 16-bit Word
solutions.
<P>
If you're writing a new Word 97 solution that needs to programmatically
access data in a database, you can use Microsoft(R) Data Access Objects
(DAO) instead of the Wbodbc.wll functions. DAO 3.5, which is included with
Microsoft Office 97, is the newest version of DAO. There are two paths to
data within one DAO interface: ODBCDirect and Microsoft Jet. One of the two
paths will be more appropriate, depending on what the solution is doing.
<P>
For example, if your solution is accessing a Microsoft Jet .mdb file or any
other file share database, you should use the Microsoft Jet path.
ODBCDirect was created specifically for accessing remote data. For more
information about ODBCDirect, see to "Data Access Objects (DAO) 3.5 and
ODBCDirect," a paper on the Microsoft Access Developer Forum
(<B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/accessdev/)">http://www.microsoft.com/accessdev/).</A></B> For more information about accessing
the Microsoft Jet database engine, see "Using DAO from Microsoft Word" in
Microsoft Word Visual Basic Help (Vbawrd8.hlp).
