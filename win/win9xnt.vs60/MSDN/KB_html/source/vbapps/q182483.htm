The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition

<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Visual Basic for Applications macros in Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh
Edition, when you use the Text property to read text from a cell, not all
of the text contained in the object is returned.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs if you use the Text property to read text from a cell
that contains more than 255 characters; the Text property can read only 255
characters from a cell.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft provides programming examples for illustration only, without
warranty either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the
implied warranties of merchantability and/or fitness for a particular
purpose. This article assumes that you are familiar with the programming
language being demonstrated and the tools used to create and debug
procedures. Microsoft support engineers can help explain the functionality
of a particular procedure, but they will not modify these examples to
provide added functionality or construct procedures to meet your specific
needs. If you have limited programming experience, you may want to contact
the Microsoft fee-based consulting line at (800) 936-5200. For more
information about the support options available from Microsoft, please see
the following page on the World Wide Web:
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/supportnet/refguide/">http://www.microsoft.com/supportnet/refguide/</A></B>

</PRE>If there is a chance that a cell will contain more than 255 characters,
use the Value property to read the text from the cell. The Value property
can read up to 32,767 characters from a cell.
<P>
For example, if you want to read the text from cell A1, when cell A1
contains more than 255 characters, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Enter the following Visual Basic for Applications code into a module
   sheet:
<P>
<PRE>      Sub Read_Text()

          MyVar = Range("A1").Value
          MsgBox MyVar

      End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>Run the Read_Text macro.
<P>
</OL>A message box with the text from cell A1 is displayed.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design of Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
You can use the Text property in Microsoft Excel to read text from cells:
<P>
<PRE>   MyVar = Range("A1").Text

</PRE></OL>In earlier versions of Microsoft Excel, the problem described in this
article does not occur because cells can only contain up to 256 characters.
<P>
However, Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition allows up to 32,767
characters per cell. Because of this, the Text property may not work as
expected when you use it to read a cell that contains more than 255
characters.
