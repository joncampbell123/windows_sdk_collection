The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, version 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The APPLICATION.SOUND.PLAY() or SOUNDNOTE.PLAY functions allow a
macro to execute and play wave(.WAV) files. When you use these
functions in a macro, Microsoft Excel must wait for the entire sound
file to play before it can run the rest of the macro.
<P>
You can use the following

<UL><LI>The Declare Functions,
<P>
   -and-

<LI>Microsoft Windows version 3.1(which includes MultiMedia Extensions),
<P>
   -and-

<LI>A sound card (such as the Windows Sound System or MediaVision's Pro
   Audio Spectrum),
<P>
</UL>to play the sound file with a macro. When you play the sound file in
this manner, the macro will not have to wait for the wave file to
finish playing. As soon as MultiMedia Extensions takes over playing
the sound file, Microsoft Excel continues to execute the rest of the
macro.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you play the .WAV file this way, the sound file continues to play
while the macro finishes executing, and it appears as if Microsoft
Excel is performing two tasks at once. To demonstrate this behavior,
play a .WAV file describing the contents of a dialog box and then
display the dialog box. The following sample macro can be used in
Microsoft Excel, version 5.0, for this purpose.

logical line or you can divide the lines of code and include the line
continuation character. For more information about Visual Basic for

Basic User's Guide."
<P>
WARNING: The Declare Function statements listed in the following
macro are very sensitive. If used incorrectly, these functions may
cause a general protection (GP) fault in Windows or cause serious
software problems.
<P>
<PRE>'The following two lines should be entered as a single line on a 'module
</PRE>sheet
<PRE>Declare Function sndPlaySound Lib "MMSYSTEM.DLL" (ByVal lpszSoundName
</PRE>As String,_ ByVal wFlags As Integer) As Integer
<P>
<PRE>Sub main()
   'Calls the sndPlaySound function and passes it the name of
   'the sound file to play
   Call sndPlaySound("c:\bat\wave\close.wav", 0)
End Sub

</PRE>You can replace c:\bat\wave\close.wav with the path to any valid .wav
file. This macro assumes the that you are using Microsoft Windows 3.1
and have a compatible sound card installed. Software sound drivers
such as SPEAK.EXE will not give the desired results (these drivers
must play the entire sound file before allowing Microsoft Excel to
continue execution of the macro).
<P>
For more complete information about the sndPlaySound function of the
MMSYSTEM.DLL, refer to the "Multimedia Programmer's Reference." This
manual is part of the Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1,
Software Development Kit (SDK).
