<UL><LI>Close Word and rename your Normal.dot file

<LI>For a wrong version of the VBE.dll file, do the following steps:
<P>
<P><PRE>     1. Exit all currently open applications.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>     2. Start a MS-DOS Prompt in a Window by doing the following:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>         a. Click Start, point to Programs, click the mouse
            on MS-DOS Prompt, and then click Properties.

         b. Click the Screen tab, under Usage, click Window, and then

         c. Cick Start, point to Programs, and then click MS-DOS
            Prompt. You may have to enlarge the window.

     2. Change the directory to the location of the VBE.dll file
        by typing the following and then pressing Enter:

           CD C:\progra~1\common~1\micros~1\vba
 
        Note: This is the default directory for the VBE.dll file.
        If you have installed Microsoft Office into another
        Drive or Directory, you will need to type its path.

     3. Unregister the VBE.dll by typing the following:

           C:\Windows\System\REGSVR32 /U VBE.DLL

        Note: This is the default directory for the Windows System
        directory. If you have installed Windows into another
        Directory, you will need to type its path.

     4. Minimize the MS-DOS Prompt window.

     5. Start Microsoft Explorer and rename VBE.dll to VBE.old
        
        Note: The default installation folder for VBE.dll is:

           C:\Program Files\Common files\Microsoft Shared\VBA

     6. In Microsoft Explorer copy the file, VBE.dll, from the
        Microsoft Office CD, found in the folder of:

           &lt;CDROM drive:&gt;\OS\System\VBE.dll

        to the following folder on your hard drive:

           C:\Program Files\Common files\Microsoft Shared\VBA

        Note: This is the default directory for the VBE.dll file.
        If you have installed Microsoft Office into another
        Drive or Directory, you will need to copy to that path.

     7. Maximize the MS-DOS Prompt window.

     8. In the MS-DOS Prompt window, make sure the current
        directory is

           C:\Program Files\Common files\Microsoft Shared\VBA

        or change the directory to the location of the VBE.dll
        file by typing the following and then pressing Enter:

           CD C:\progra~1\common~1\micros~1\vba

           Note: This is the default directory for the VBE.dll
           file. If you have installed Microsoft Office into
           another Drive or Directory, you will need to type
           its path.

        then re-register the VBE.DLL by typing the following
        and then pressing Enter:

          C:\Windows\System\REGSVR32 VBE.DLL

     9. Exit the MS-DOS Prompt window.


</PRE><LI>Network permissions of Create is necessary; 
   the Visual Basic Editor(VBE) creates a folder in the Temp directory  
   to store files.

<LI>Add more RAM to your computer

<LI>Acquire more hard disk space (either by adding a larger disk drive
   or by using a disk compression utility).

<LI>As a short term solution, you can free RAM by shutting down unneeded
   programs or you can free disk space by deleting unneeded files.

<LI>Restart Windows.

<LI>Uninstall and Reinstall Microsoft Office 97.
