The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft PowerPoint 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Binder 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Office 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, when you type or edit a formula in a worksheet, you
may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down.
   If the problem persists, contact the program vendor.

</PRE>If you click Details, you receive an error message similar to one or more 
of the following:
<P>
<PRE>   EXCEL caused an invalid page fault in module EXCEL.EXE at
   014f:300960ef.

   BINDER caused an exception 6bfH in module KERNEL32.DLL at
   014f:bff9a080.

</PRE>When these messages appear, the Microsoft Office 97 programs may close or
stop responding.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may occur when all of the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>You edit or type a formula in a Microsoft Excel worksheet that is
   stored in Microsoft Office Binder 97 or an embedded worksheet in
   Microsoft Word 97 or Microsoft PowerPoint 97. For example, you type
   the following formula:
<P>
<P><PRE>      =Test()
</PRE><P>
   -and-

<LI>The formula refers to a custom Visual Basic for Applications function.
   For example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Function Test()
<PRE></PRE>          A = 1
          B = 2
          Test = A + B
      End Function

   -and-

</PRE><LI>The workbook was saved with a breakpoint set within the custom function.
<P>
</UL>NOTE: A breakpoint may be set manually by using the Toggle Breakpoint
command on the Debug menu or programmatically by using the Stop statement.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To prevent this problem from occurring, do not set a breakpoint in the
custom function. If you need to pause or break your macro at run-time, use
the MsgBox function or the End statement instead.
<P>
For more information about the MsgBox function, click the Index tab in
Help, type the following text
<P>
<PRE>   msgbox

</PRE>and then double-click the selected text to go to the "MsgBox function"
topic.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you set a breakpoint in a custom function, and then type a formula
that refers to that function, Microsoft Excel displays the Visual Basic
Editor in break mode. You can then step through the macro code by pressing
F8, or you can press F5 to continue running the code. You can also set
watches and perform other tasks.
<P>
In Visual Basic for Applications, use the following steps to set a
breakpoint in a custom function or subroutine:

<OL><P><LI>Move the insertion point to line of code where you want to set the
   breakpoint.

<P><LI>Press F9, or click Toggle Breakpoint on the Debug menu.
<P>
</OL>The line of code turns a maroon color and a maroon colored dot appears to 
the left of the code.
<P>
NOTE: You can also remove a breakpoint by following the same steps.
<P>
When you use a Microsoft Office 97 program that contains an embedded
Microsoft Excel 97 workbook, and you type or edit a formula that refers
to a custom function containing a breakpoint, Microsoft Excel 97 and
the Microsoft Office 97 program may stop responding. Microsoft recommends
that you do not set a breakpoint in a custom function when you are working
in Microsoft Office Binder 97 or your workbook is embedded in another
Microsoft Office 97 program.
