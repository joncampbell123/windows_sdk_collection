The information in this article applies to:

<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0
<LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, there are no Visual Basic for Applications functions to
determine either your \Windows or your \Windows\System directories.
<P>
NOTE: It may be possible to work around this situation by creating a macro
that makes calls to the Windows application programming interface (API).
This type of programming is supported by the Windows Software Development
Kit (SDK) and the Visual Basic, Professional Edition, support groups. The
level of support you can receive from these groups depends on the
individual support policies of the group. (Microsoft support engineers may
not be able to assist in specific construction of macros that use API
programming.) If you have limited programming experience, you may want to
consult one of the Microsoft Solution Providers. Solution Providers offer a
wide range of fee-based services, including creating custom macros. For
more information about Microsoft Solution Providers, call Microsoft
Customer Information Service at (800) 426-9400.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft provides examples of Visual Basic for Applications procedures for
illustration only, without warranty either expressed or implied, including,
but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and/or fitness
for a particular purpose. The Visual Basic procedures in this article are
provided 'as is' and Microsoft does not guarantee that they can be used in
all situations. While Microsoft support engineers can help explain the
functionality of a particular macro, they will not modify these examples to
provide added functionality, nor will they help you construct macros to
meet your specific needs. If you have limited programming experience, you
may want to consult one of the Microsoft Solution Providers. Solution
Providers offer a wide range of fee-based services, including creating
custom macros. For more information about Microsoft Solution Providers,
call Microsoft Customer Information Service at (800) 426-9400.
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, you can create a macro to return the path to the
\Windows or \Windows\System directory by using the Declare Functions to
access built-in functions in Microsoft Windows version 3.1, Windows 95, and
Windows NT versions 3.51 and 4.0. The following macros use the
GetWindowsDirectory and GetSystemDirectory function calls to retrieve the
desired directory information.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Excel versions 7.0 and 97</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>'The following two declare statements need to be entered each on a single
'line in the module sheet.

Declare Function GetSystemDirectory Lib "kernel32" Alias _
    "GetSystemDirectoryA" (ByVal lpBuffer As _
    String, ByVal nSize As Long) As Long

Declare Function GetWindowsDirectory Lib "kernel32" Alias _
    "GetWindowsDirectoryA" (ByVal lpBuffer As _
    String, ByVal nSize As Long) As Long

Sub Get_Windows_Directory()
    'sets the buffer length for both variables to 144
    Dim Win_Dir As String * 144
    Dim Sys_Dir As String * 144
    y = GetWindowsDirectory(Win_Dir, 144)
    'returns the \Windows directory
    wd = Left(Win_Dir, y)
    'Displays the windows directory in a Message box
    MsgBox wd
    'Returns the Windows\System directory
    x = GetSystemDirectory(Sys_Dir, 144)
    sd = Left(Sys_Dir, x)
    'Displays the \Windows\System directory in a Message box
    MsgBox sd
End Sub


</PRE><h3>Microsoft Excel version 5.0</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>'The following two declare statements need to be entered each on a single
'line in the module sheet.

Declare Function GetSystemDirectory Lib "KERNEL" (ByVal lpBuffer As _
    String, ByVal nSize As Integer) As Integer

Declare Function GetWindowsDirectory Lib "KERNEL" (ByVal lpBuffer As _
    String, ByVal nSize As Integer) As Integer

Sub GetDir()
    'sets the buffer length for both variables to 144
    Dim Win_Dir As String * 144
    Dim Sys_Dir As String * 144
    'returns the \Windows directory
    y = GetWindowsDirectory(Win_Dir, Len(Win_Dir))
    'Displays the windows directory in a Message box
    MsgBox Win_Dir
    'Returns the Windows\System directory
    x = GetSystemDirectory(Sys_Dir, Len(Win_Dir))
    'Displays the \Windows\System directory in a Message box
    MsgBox Sys_Dir
End Sub
