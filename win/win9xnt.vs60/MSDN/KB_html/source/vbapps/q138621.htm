</PRE><h3>Sample Visual Basic Procedures</h3>
 
<P>
This example checks to see if Book2.xls in the root directory of drive C is
already open. If the file is not already open, the macro will open it.
<P>
<PRE>   Sub TestFileOpened()

       ' Test to see if the file is open.
       If IsFileOpen("c:\Book2.xls") Then
           ' Display a message stating the file in use.
           MsgBox "File already in use!"
           '
           ' Add code here to handle case where file is open by another 
           ' user.
           '
       Else
           ' Display a message stating the file is not in use.
           MsgBox "File not in use!"
           ' Open the file in Microsoft Excel.

           ' user.

       End If
   End Sub

   ' This function checks to see if a file is open or not. If the file is
   ' already open, it returns True. If the file is not open, it returns
   ' False. Otherwise, a run-time error will occur because there is
   ' some other problem accessing the file.

   Function IsFileOpen(filename As String)
       Dim filenum As Integer, errnum As Integer

       filenum = FreeFile()   ' Get a free file number.
       ' Attempt to open the file and lock it.
       Open filename For Input Lock Read As #filenum
       Close filenum          ' Close the file.
       errnum = Err           ' Save the error number that occurred.
       On Error GoTo 0        ' Turn error checking back on.
