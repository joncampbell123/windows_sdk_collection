The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run a Visual Basic for Applications macro in Microsoft Excel 97,
the following problems may occur:

<UL><LI>You cannot stop the execution of the macro by pressing ESC or
   CTRL+BREAK.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>The screen in Microsoft Excel 97 is not updated until the macro is
   finished running. As a result, Microsoft Excel 97 appears to stop
   responding.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may occur when the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>The Visual Basic macro requires a long time to finish running.
<P>
   This may be true if your macro contains loops that iterate many times.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>While the macro is running, you switch to any other program, such
   as Microsoft Notepad or Microsoft Word 97.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>You then attempt to switch back to Microsoft Excel 97.
<P>
</UL><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, wait for the macro to finish running. After
the macro is finished, Microsoft Excel 97 updates the screen. If you wait
for a long time and the macro does not finish running, It may be necessary
to end the instance of Microsoft Excel 97 by pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL.
<P>

this article are provided 'as is' and Microsoft does not guarantee that

these examples to provide added functionality, nor will they help you
construct macros to meet your specific needs. If you have limited
programming experience, you may want to consult one of the Microsoft
Solution Providers. Solution Providers offer a wide range of fee-based
services, including creating custom macros. For more information about

<P>
Although it is not possible to prevent this problem from ever occurring,
you can lessen its affects by adding MsgBox commands to the Visual Basic
macro. For example, assume you are running the following Visual Basic
macro:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub Test()
       For X = 1 To 4000
           ThisWorkbook.Worksheets(1).Cells(1, 1).Value = X
       Next X
       For Y = 1 To 4000
           ThisWorkbook.Worksheets(1).Cells(1, 2).Value = Y
       Next Y
       For Z = 1 To 4000
           ThisWorkbook.Worksheets(1).Cells(1, 3).Value = Z
       Next Z
   End Sub

</PRE>When you run this macro, switch to another program, and then switch back
to Microsoft Excel 97, you may not be able to halt the macro by pressing
ESC. Also, the screen may not be updated properly until the macro is
finished. However, you can add message boxes that allow the screen to be
updated. For example, type the following subroutine:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub Test()
       For X = 1 To 4000
           ThisWorkbook.Worksheets(1).Cells(1, 1).Value = X
       Next X
       MsgBox "Stage one complete!"     'new line of code
       For Y = 1 To 4000
           ThisWorkbook.Worksheets(1).Cells(1, 2).Value = Y
       Next Y
       MsgBox "Stage two complete!"     'new line of code
       For Z = 1 To 4000
           ThisWorkbook.Worksheets(1).Cells(1, 3).Value = Z
       Next Z
       MsgBox "Stage three complete!"   'new line of code
   End Sub

</PRE>When each loop is completed, the macro displays a message box. When you
click OK, the screen is updated properly, and you can halt the macro by
pressing ESC.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs even if the Visual Basic macro contains one of the
following lines of code:
<P>
<PRE>   Application.EnableCancelKey = xlInterrupt

   -or-

   Application.EnableCancelKey = xlErrorHandler
</PRE>
