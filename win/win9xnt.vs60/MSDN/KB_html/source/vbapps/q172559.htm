The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In a Visual Basic for Applications subroutine in Microsoft Excel 97, the
Offset property does not return the correct range for a range object that
refers to nonadjacent cells. It returns one range of adjacent cells. This
behavior is different in earlier versions of Microsoft Excel.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs when you run a Visual Basic subroutine and the
following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>You reference a range object for a range of nonadjacent cells.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>You use the Offset property of the range object for the range of
   nonadjacent cells.
<P>
</UL><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft provides examples of Visual Basic for Applications procedures for
illustration only, without warranty either expressed or implied, including,
but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and/or fitness
for a particular purpose. The Visual Basic procedures in this article are
provided 'as is' and Microsoft does not guarantee that they can be used in
all situations. While Microsoft support engineers can help explain the
functionality of a particular macro, they will not modify these examples to
provide added functionality, nor will they help you construct macros to
meet your specific needs. If you have limited programming experience, you
may want to consult one of the Microsoft Solution Providers. Solution
Providers offer a wide range of fee-based services, including creating
custom macros. For more information about Microsoft Solution Providers,
call Microsoft Customer Information Service at (800) 426-9400.
<P>
To work around this problem, reference each range of adjacent cells
separately and then apply the Offset property. The following sample
subprocedure uses this method:
<P>
<PRE>   ' The following subroutine takes the selection and moves it over by one
   ' column to the right. The subroutine checks to see if the selected
   ' cells are adjacent or nonadjacent and handles the two situations
   ' differently.

   Sub Range_Offset_Select()

       ' Dimensions variables to be used.
       Dim NewRange As Range, singleArea As Range

       'Check to see if the selection is an adjacent selection.
       If Selection.Areas.Count = 1 Then

           ' Move the selection by one column to the right.
           Selection.Offset(0, 1).Select

       ' Else, if the selection is a nonadjacent selection...
       Else

           ' Sets the range object, Newrange to the offset by one column
           ' from the first adjacent area of the selection
           Set NewRange = Selection.Areas(1).Offset(0, 1)

           ' Starts a For/Each loop for each adjacent area of the
           ' selection.
           For Each singleArea In Selection.Areas
               Set NewRange = Union(NewRange, singleArea.Offset(0, 1))
           Next
           NewRange.Select

       End If

   End Sub

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Offset property in Visual Basic for Applications for Microsoft Excel
returns a Range object that represents a range that is offset from the
specified range.
