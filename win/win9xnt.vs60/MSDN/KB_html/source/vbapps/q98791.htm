The information in this article applies to:

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multiuser skills.
<P>
This article explains how to use Microsoft Visual Basic to request
data from Microsoft Access using dynamic data exchange (DDE).
<P>
For information that goes into greater detail and demonstrates how to
parse the requested data in a Visual Basic array and then populate a
grid control with the data, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Access Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../vbapps/q99405.htm">Q99405</A></B>
   TITLE:      ACC: Part 2 DDE in Visual Basic to Request MS Access Data

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This article provides a code example demonstrating how to request
information from the Employees table in the sample database Northwind.mdb
(or NWIND.MDB in versions 1.x and 2.0).
<P>
The following code example demonstrates how to fill a Visual Basic text
box with the entire contents of a Microsoft Access table, including field
names.
<P>
This article assumes that you are familiar with Visual Basic for
Applications and with creating Microsoft Access applications using the
programming tools provided with Microsoft Access. For more information
about Visual Basic for Applications, please refer to your version of the
"Building Applications with Microsoft Access" manual.
<P>
NOTE: Visual Basic for Applications is called Access Basic in Microsoft
Access versions 1.x and 2.0. For more information about Access Basic,
please refer to the "Introduction to Programming" manual in Microsoft
Access version 1.x or the "Building Applications" manual in Microsoft
Access version 2.0
<P>
In Visual Basic, create a new form, add the following controls, and
set the appropriate properties for each control:
<P>
<PRE>   Text Box
   -------------------------------------------------
      Name: Text1
      Multiline: True
      Scrollbars: 3 - Both (vertical and horizontal)

   Command Button
   -----------------
      Name: Command1

</PRE>NOTE: Size the text box large so that data can be seen and scrolled
easily following the DDE request.
<P>
Double click the command button and enter the following code between
the "Sub Command1_Click ()" and "End Sub" lines:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub Command1_Click()
      Text1.LinkTopic = "MSACCESS|NORTHWIND;TABLE Employees"
      (or NWIND in Microsoft Access versions 1.x and 2.0.)
      Text1.LinkMode = 2     ' Establish a manual DDE link to Access
      Text1.LinkItem = "All" ' Setup the DDE request item to get ALL the
                             ' .. data from the Employees table,
                             ' .. including field names.
      Text1.LinkRequest      ' Request the data into the Text1 text box
      Text1.LinkMode = 0     ' Terminate the DDE link to Access
   End Sub

</PRE>In this example, the first line specifies "MSACCESS" as the
application to communicate with and "NORTHWIND;TABLE Employees" (or NWIND
in Microsoft Access versions 1.x and 2.0) as the topic of the DDE
conversation. We could also specify an SQL statement as the topic of the
conversation. The following line of code is functionally equivalent to the
first line above:
<P>
<PRE>   Text1.LinkTopic = "MSACCESS|NORTHWIND;SQL Select * From Employees;"
   (or NWIND in Microsoft Access versions 1.x and 2.0)

</PRE>In this example, the item "All" tells Microsoft Access to supply
Visual Basic with the entire contents of the Topic, including field
names. Microsoft Access supports a rich set of other items and topics.
For a list of supported topics and items, please see the following article
in the Microsoft Access Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../access/q89586.htm">Q89586</A></B>
   TITLE:      ACC: Microsoft Access as a DDE Server

</PRE>When you run this example, be sure that Microsoft Access is running
and has the Northwind.mdb database opened (or NWIND in Microsoft Access
versions 1.x and 2.0). When you run this code, the text box will be filled
with the entire contents of the Employees table. Each field will be
delimited by a tab character, Chr$(9), and each record row will end with a
newline character (a carriage return followed by a linefeed character).
