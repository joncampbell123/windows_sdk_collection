The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, version 5.0

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When multiple instances of Microsoft Excel are simultaneously serving as
dynamic data exchange (DDE) clients to a single DDE server, only one
instance of Microsoft Excel will be updated.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This is a problem with the current implementation of the DDE management
library (DDEML). The problem will only occur when all of the following
conditions are met:

<UL><LI>There are two or more instances of the same application serving as DDE
   clients.

<LI>The applications all have objects with the same name (such as "Sheet1")

<LI>The applications are all trying to use FETCH.ADVISE
<P>
</UL><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft provides examples of Visual Basic for Applications procedures for

provided 'as is' and Microsoft does not guarantee that they can be used in
all situations. While Microsoft support engineers can help explain the
functionality of a particular macro, they will not modify these examples to
provide added functionality, nor will they help you construct macros to
meet your specific needs. If you have limited programming experience, you
may want to consult one of the Microsoft Solution Providers. Solution
Providers offer a wide range of fee-based services, including creating
custom macros. For more information about Microsoft Solution Providers,

<OL><P><LI>Start Microsoft Query.

<P><LI>Open two instances of Microsoft Excel and run the following Visual Basic
   macro from each instance:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub dde()

      chanNum = DDEInitiate("msquery", "system")
      ' Use the path for your query file for the following:
      ' Note: query files in Excel 97 contains a dqy extension.
      DDEExecute chanNum, "[open('c:\excel\query1.qry')]"
      nRows = DDERequest(chanNum, "NumRows")
      nCols = DDERequest(chanNum, "NumCols")
      DDEExecute chanNum, "[fetch.advise('Excel','sheet1','r1c1:r" &amp; _
      nRows(LBound(nRows)) &amp; "c" &amp; nCols(LBound(nCols)) &amp; "','all')]"

   End Sub

   NOTE: You will need to create a query file to run this macro if you
   don't already have one. Use the path for this file in line 2 of the
   macro.)

</PRE><P><LI>Check Sheet1 on both instances of Excel; they should display a copy of
   the query.

<P><LI>Switch to Query Tool and from the Records menu, choose Allow Editing.

<P><LI>Change some of the records in the query.
<P>
</OL>Check Sheet1 on both instances of Microsoft Excel; the records should have
been updated on one but not the other.
