<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Because some macros and add-ins create hidden names on a sheet, links may
exist even after you attempt to remove all known references (including
objects and formulas) from a worksheet. In this situation, when you open a
worksheet containing the hidden links, you may receive the following error
message:
<P>
<PRE>   Update References to Unopened Documents

</PRE>The macro in the "More Information" section of this article provides a
macro to remove all the hidden names in a workbook.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The macro displays a message box listing three items: (1) whether the
defined name is visible or hidden, (2) the defined name, and (3) what that
name refers to (the workbook cell reference). You may choose Yes or No to
delete or keep each defined name.
<P>
CAUTION: Removing names that contain links can eliminate errant links,
however doing so could affect the integrity of your data and return
unexpected results. Microsoft recommends that you create a backup of your
workbook before running this macro which may make changes to your data.

</PRE><h3>Visual Basic Code Example</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   'Module to remove all hidden names on active workbook
   Sub Remove_Hidden_Names()

       'Dimension variables.
       Dim xName As Variant
       Dim Result As Variant
       Dim Vis As Variant

       'Loop once for each name in the workbook.
       For Each xName In ActiveWorkbook.Names

           'If a name is not visible (it is hidden)...
           If xName.Visible = True Then
               Vis = "Visible"
           Else
               Vis = "Hidden"
           End If

           '...ask whether or not to delete the name.
           Result = MsgBox(prompt:="Delete " &amp; Vis &amp; " Name " &amp; _
               Chr(10) &amp; xName.Name &amp; "?" &amp; Chr(10) &amp; _
               "Which refers to: " &amp; Chr(10) &amp; xName.RefersTo, _
               Buttons:=vbYesNo)

           'If the result is true, then delete the name.
           If Result = vbYes Then xName.Delete

           'Loop to the next name.
       Next xName

   End Sub

</PRE>NOTE: If your sheet names contain spaces, you may receive an error when you
attempt to delete the defined name.
