<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 97, if a macro closes a workbook (even its own workbook)
that contains running macros, the macros stop running immediately.
Depending on how your macros are written, this may cause problems.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This occurs in Microsoft Excel 97 because macros in the workbook
immediately halt execution when a workbook is closed.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
This new behavior should only cause problems if a macro closes a workbook
(even its own workbook) that contains a running macro. Look for the
following commands in your macros:
<P>
<PRE>   ThisWorkbook.Close

   -and-

   ActiveWorkbook.Close

</PRE>If your macros contain either of these commands, you may be closing
workbooks that contain running macros. You should examine your macros to
make sure you are not trying to run macro commands in a workbook after it
is closed.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design of Microsoft Excel 97.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>

<P>
In earlier versions of Microsoft Excel, if you close a workbook that
contains running macros, the workbook is not actually closed until the
macros complete execution.
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 97, the behavior is somewhat different. When the command
to close a workbook executes, the workbook referenced in the macro closes
immediately, and any macros it contains halt execution.
