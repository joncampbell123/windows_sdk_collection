<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article demonstrates how to call various LanMan services from 32-bit
Visual Basic 4.0 applications. The sample code also applies to applications
which use the 32-bit VBA engine. An example of such an application is
Microsoft Excel 97.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Windows NT exposes LanMan 32-bit Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)
to provide network services. These APIs are called only from 32-bit
programs running on a Windows NT workstation or server and are used to
control both the local and remote Windows NT machines that you have
permission to access.
<P>
This article contains code examples of using the following LanMan APIs:
<P>
<PRE>   NetGetDCName
   NetUserDel
   NetGroupAddUser
   NetGroupDelUser
   NetUserAdd        (using Level 1 structure)
   NetUserEnum       (using Level 0 structure)
   NetGroupEnumUsers (using Level 0 structure)
   NetGroupEnum      (using Level 0 structure)
   NetUserGetGroups  (using Level 0 structure)
   NetAPIBufferFree
   NetAPIBufferAllocate

</PRE>Although, Visual Basic stores strings internally as UNICODE, it converts
them to ANSI when it calls APIs. Normally this isn't a problem because most
32-bit APIs have both an ANSI and a UNICODE version. However, LanMan APIs
only support UNICODE. The code snippet below demonstrates how to use Byte
arrays to pass UNICODE parameters.
<P>
Instead of using strings, for example:
<P>
<PRE>   "X = My_ANSI_API("Some String")"

</PRE>use Byte arrays, such the one below, because they aren't converted to ANSI:
<P>
<PRE>   Dim Temp() As Byte, Message As String
   Message = "Some String"
   Temp = Message &amp; vbNullChar     '
   MyUnicodeAPI Temp(0)
   Message = Temp                  ' modified message
