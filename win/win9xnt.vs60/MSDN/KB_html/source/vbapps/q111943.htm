<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, version 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, when you open a workbook that contains worksheets with
different page setup orientations, and you print the entire workbook, some
of the worksheets may be printed with the wrong page orientation.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in
Microsoft Excel for Windows version 5.0c.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, you must re-establish the orientation for each
sheet; you can do this manually, or you can use a macro to do it
automatically.
<P>
<P><h3>To re-establish the orientation manually</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>From the File menu, choose Print. Under Print What, select the Entire
   Workbook option and choose Print Preview.

<P><LI>For each worksheet in the workbook that is displayed in the wrong
   orientation, choose the Setup button.
<P>
   Note that on the Page tab in the Page Setup dialog box, the correct
   option under Orientation is selected. Choose OK.

<P><LI>Choose the Next button to view the next worksheet in the workbook.
   Repeat steps 2 and 3 for the each sheet in the workbook.
<P>
</OL>The entire workbook will be printed correctly as long as the workbook
remains open (you will have to repeat this procedure if you close and
reopen the workbook).
<P>
<P><h3>To re-establish the orientation automatically</h3>
 
<P>
The following macro adjusts the page orientation and prints the entire
workbook correctly. To use the macro:

<OL><P><LI>Enter the following code on a macro sheet:
<P>
<PRE>      Sub PrintOutWorkbook()
      Dim Page As Object
      'Loop through each Worksheet in the active workbook
      'using "Page" as a loop variable.
      For Each Page In ActiveWorkbook.Worksheets
          'Reset page orientation to itself
          Page.PageSetup.Orientation = Page.PageSetup.Orientation
      'End of loop
      Next Page
          'Print the Entire Workbook
          ActiveWorkbook.PrintOut
      End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>To run the macro, use the Menu Editor to assign it to a toolbar button
   or menu command, run it directly from the macro dialog box.
