<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In earlier versions of Microsoft Excel, if you use the Hide method to hide
a custom dialog box, Microsoft Excel does not hide the dialog box until the
macro that contains the Hide method is finished running.
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 97, if you use the Hide method to hide a UserForm, the
UserForm is hidden immediately. You can redisplayed the UserForm later by
using the Show method in the macro (or in another macro). You can also use
the Unload statement to hide a UserForm; however, any settings in the
UserForm are lost. Note that you may want to use the Unload statement if
you want to reset the UserForm.
<P>
This article explains how to create a UserForm and contains a sample Visual
Basic for Applications macro that temporarily hides the UserForm (using the
Hide method and the Unload statement).
<P>
