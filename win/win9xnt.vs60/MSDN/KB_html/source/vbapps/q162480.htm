The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In earlier versions of Word, WordBasic macro code could be hidden with the
MacroCopy command. This command makes a macro "execute-only." In this
state, the macro code cannot be viewed, but the macro can be run.
<P>
This technique is useful if you are distributing macro solutions to
customers or to coworkers, and you do not want the customers or coworkers
to be able to modify the macros. This design means that some macros in the
template can be "execute-only" while others remain viewable.
<P>
In the versions of Word listed at the beginning of this article, you can
protect only an entire project (that is, all of the code within a template
or document must be either locked or unlocked). When a project is locked,
any Visual Basic for Applications code within the template cannot be
viewed.
<P>
The "More Information" section of this article discusses how templates
containing "execute-only" macros that were created in earlier versions
of Word are converted.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Templates containing execute-only macros are converted differently
depending on whether these execute-only macros are in the Normal template
(Normal.dot) or a custom template.
<P>
<P><h3>Execute-Only Macros in Normal.dot</h3>
 
<P>
Word will convert the Normal template (typically the first time Word is 
started after you upgrade to versions of Word 97 or later) and will not
convert any of the execute-only macros. A backup copy of the original
Normal.dot will be saved with a default file name of "Backup of
Normal.wbk" in the same directory or folder where Normal.dot is
located. This allows Word 97 and later versions of the Normal template
to be unprotected; you can record new macros and have all the typical
programming functionality that Word allows.
<P>
NOTE: The "Backup of Normal.wbk" file is only created the very first time 
Word is run. If, after starting Word, you replace the Normal.dot file with 
an earlier version of the Word Normal.dot file, the backup file will not be 
created. 
<P>
<P><h3>Execute-Only Macros in a Custom Template</h3>
 
<P>
When any template other than Normal.dot is converted, all execute-only 
macros remain in the template, and the entire template or project is locked 
(you cannot edit code in it). This design means that custom solutions will 
still work and the code will still be protected. A disadvantage is that 
formerly accessible macros may no longer be accessible. 
<P>
When you attempt to do any of the following:

<UL><LI>Edit a converted execute-only macro.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE>
<LI>View the project contents in the Visual Basic Editor Project Explorer.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE>
<LI>View the project properties in the Visual Basic Editor Project
   Explorer.
<P>
</UL>the following alert is displayed:
<P>
<PRE>   Project is unviewable

</PRE>To gain access to these macros, use either of the following methods:

<UL><LI>Access the original template in the earlier version of Word.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE>
<LI>In the earlier version of Word, remove all of the execute-only macros
   so Word will not protect the project during the conversion process.
<PRE>                   Earlier Version
