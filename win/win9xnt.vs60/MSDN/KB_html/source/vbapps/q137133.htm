<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Application Note "Customizing Menu Bars, Menus, and Menu Items"
(WE1182) is now available from Microsoft Product Support Services. This
Application Note can help you learn some techniques for writing
Visual Basic, Applications Edition, code for use with custom menus.
This Application Note is meant to be used as a supplement to Chapter
12 ("Menus and Toolbars") of the "Visual Basic User's Guide." The
Vba_mnu.xls file included with this Application Note contains code
examples you can run. These code examples can be used with the
following elements: menu bars, menu items, submenus, and shortcut
menus.

                               =========

</PRE>While many of the common tasks associated with customizing menu bars
and menus can be accomplished with the Menu Editor (with a module
sheet active, click Menu Editor on the Options menu), in order to get
further functionality from menu bars and menus, or to tailor them for
a custom-built application, you may want to create Visual Basic(R),
Applications Edition, procedures.
<P>
For more information about the Menu Editor, see pages 242-248 of the
"Visual Basic User's Guide."
<P>
This Application Note can help you learn some techniques for writing
Visual Basic, Applications Edition, code for use with custom menus.
This Application Note is meant to be used as a supplement to Chapter
12 ("Menus and Toolbars") of the "Visual Basic User's Guide." The
Vba_mnu.xls file included with this Application Note contains code
examples you can run. These code examples can be used with the
following elements: menu bars, menu items, submenus, and shortcut
menus.

<P>
Menu bars are the objects on which menus, menu items, and submenus are
built.

</PRE>For a list of the built-in menu bars included in Microsoft Excel 5.0, see
page 244 of the "Visual Basic User's Guide." The following table lists the
menu bars that are included in Microsoft Excel 5.0 to maintain
compatibility with earlier versions of Microsoft Excel. These menu bars are
not listed in the "User's Guide." (To display these menus, click Options on
the Tools menu, and select Microsoft Excel version 4.0 menus on the General

pages 249-250 of the "Visual Basic User's Guide." Constants that are
not included in the "User's Guide" are listed in the following table.

</PRE><h3>To save the active menu bar state (either built-in or customized)</h3>
 
<P>
You may want to declare "oldMenuBar" as a public variable so that
another subroutine can use it in an Auto_Close subroutine. Declaring
and using the variable this way will reset the user's previous menu
bar to its original state.
<P>
<PRE>   Public oldMenuBar

</PRE><h2>MENUS</h2>
 
<P>
Menus are added to either a custom or built-in menu bar.

</PRE><h2>MENU ITEMS</h2>
 
<P>
Menu items can be added to or removed from either built-in or custom
menus. They usually have an access key, and many of the built-in menu
items contain a shortcut key. Menu items that have an ellipsis (...)
following the caption denote a menu item that opens a dialog box. Menu
items that have a small black arrow after the caption will display one
or more submenu items.

</PRE><h3>To add a separator bar menu item</h3>
 
<P>
To add a separator bar to a menu, use a hyphen in place of the caption
text of a menu item.
<P>
<PRE>   Sub menuitem_Ex4()
      MenuBars(xlWorksheet).Menus("&amp;Edit").MenuItems.Add _
         Caption:="-", Before:="Delete Sheet"
   End Sub

</PRE><h3>To add a shortcut key to a menu item</h3>
 
<P>
This macro adds a menu item called "Command1" with a CTRL+K shortcut
key to the Edit menu on the worksheet menu bar. It also specifies that
the "myShortCutExample" procedure is run when you press CTRL+K.
<P>
<PRE>   Sub menuItem_Ex5()
      With Application.MenuBars(xlWorksheet).Menus("&amp;Edit")

      End With
   End Sub

</PRE><h3>To assign a Help file to a menu item</h3>
 
<P>
The following macro adds a menu item called "Visual Basic Help" to the
Help menu on the module sheet menu bar. The OnAction property runs the
Open_VisualBasic_Help macro, which opens the Help file.
<P>
Note: The StatusBar property is only available on Excel 5.0c and later.
<P>
<PRE>   Sub menuItem_Ex7()
     With Application.MenuBars(xlModule).Menus("&amp;Help")
       .MenuItems.Add _
         Caption:="Visual Basic Help", _
         OnAction:="Open_VisualBasic_Help", _
         Before:=1, _
         StatusBar:="Opens Excel Visual Basic Help"
     End With
   End Sub

</PRE>This macro opens the Contents topic of the Visual Basic Help file when
you select the "Visual Basic Help" menu item.
<P>
<PRE>   Sub Open_VisualBasic_Help()
      Application.Help Application.Path &amp; "\vba_xl.hlp", 65535
   End Sub

</PRE><h2>SUBMENUS</h2>
 
<P>
Submenus appear off to the side when a menu item is selected. A menu
item that has a submenu has a small black arrow located at the right
end of the menu item.
<P>
<P><h3>To add a submenu</h3>
 
<P>
This macro adds a menu item called "Command1" to the Edit menu (on the
worksheet menu bar). It then adds two submenu items to the Command1
menu item; both of these submenu items run a procedure called
"subMenuMacro."
<P>
<PRE>   Sub SubMenu_Ex1()
      With Application.MenuBars(xlWorksheet).Menus("&amp;Edit")
         .MenuItems.AddMenu Caption:="Command1"
         .MenuItems("Command1").MenuItems.Add _
            Caption:="Added SubMenu 1", _
            OnAction:="subMenuMacro"
         .MenuItems("Command1").MenuItems.Add _
            Caption:="Added SubMenu 2", _
            OnAction:="subMenuMacro"
      End With
   End Sub

</PRE>The subMenuMacro macro returns the caption text of the submenu when
either "Added SubMenu 1" or "Added SubMenu 2" is selected.
<P>
<PRE>   Sub subMenuMacro()
   Dim theSubMenu As String
   theSubMenu = Application.Caller
   With Application.MenuBars(xlWorksheet).Menus("Edit")
         MsgBox .MenuItems("Command1").MenuItems(theSubMenu).Caption
      End With
   End Sub

</PRE><h3>To delete a submenu</h3>
 
<P>
This macro deletes all of the submenus from the Fill menu item on the
Edit menu (on the worksheet menu bar).
<P>
<PRE>   Sub SubMenu_Ex2()

   Dim subMnuItm As Object

      For Each subMnuItm In
   Application.MenuBars(xlWorksheet).Menus("&amp;Edit"). _
         MenuItems("&amp;Fill").MenuItems
         subMnuItm.Delete
      Next subMnuItm

   End Sub

</PRE><h2>SHORTCUT MENU BARS</h2>
 
<P>
Shortcut menu bars appear when you use the right mouse button to click
a specific Microsoft Excel object. Microsoft Excel has three shortcut
menu bars that each have a variety of menus available. You cannot
create custom shortcut menu bars, although the built-in menu bars are
fully customizable. The following table lists all of the associated
menus that are available for each shortcut menu bar.
