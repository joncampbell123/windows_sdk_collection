<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual Basic Programming System, Applications Edition,
   version 1.0
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, version 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you use the Is operator in a Microsoft Visual Basic Programming System,
Applications Edition module to compare Microsoft Excel objects, the
comparison may return the value FALSE even if you are comparing an object
to itself.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Is operator compares two object reference variables. However, in some
cases, a different object is returned each time you use a property to
return an object. For example, when you use the Selection property to
return a selected Microsoft Excel object, a different object is returned by
each call to the Selection property.
<P>
<P><h2>EXAMPLE 1</h2>
 
<P>
If you use the Is operator to compare the Microsoft Excel object returned
by the Selection property to the same object returned by the Selection
property as in the following lines of code
<P>
<P><h3>In a Visual Basic Module in Microsoft Excel</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   If Selection Is Selection Then Beep

</PRE><h3>In a Visual Basic, Applications Edition Module</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   If Application.Selection Is _
      ActiveSheet.Range(Application.Selection.Address) Then Beep

</PRE>the comparison returns the value FALSE, and neither of these lines of code
causes the system to beep. In this case, the object does not know that a
reference has already been made to it and returns another reference.
<P>
<P><h2>EXAMPLE 2</h2>
 
<P>
The same issue occurs if you use the ActiveSheet property to return an
object such as a button, check box, or group box. In the following example,
the comparison also returns the value FALSE even though you are comparing a
button to itself.
<P>
<P><h3>In a Visual Basic Module in Microsoft Excel</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   If ActiveSheet.Buttons(1) Is ActiveSheet.Buttons("Button 1") _
      Then Beep

</PRE>and you do not receive a beep.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
To use the Is operator to compare two Microsoft Excel objects that are the
same as in the above examples, use following examples:
<P>
<P><h2>EXAMPLE 1</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>In a Visual Basic Module in Microsoft Excel</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   ' Use the Address method and the equal sign (=) operator to
   ' compare range references
   If Selection.Address = Selection.Address Then Beep

</PRE><h3>In a Visual Basic, Applications Edition Module</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   ' Use the value of a unique property of an object for
   ' comparison as a workaround.
   If Application.Selection.Address = _
      ActiveSheet.Range(Application.Selection.Address).Address Then Beep

</PRE><h2>EXAMPLE 2</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>In a Visual Basic Module in Microsoft Excel</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   ' Use Name method and the equal sign (=) operator to
   ' compare button objects
   If ActiveSheet.Buttons(1).Name = ActiveSheet.Buttons("Button 1").Name _
      Then Beep
