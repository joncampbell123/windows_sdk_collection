<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
On a UserForm, you can designate only one CommandButton object as the
default command button. Because only one CommandButton can be the default
CommandButton, if you set the Default property for any CommandButton to
True, the Default properties for all other CommandButtons on the UserForm
are automatically set to False.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Behavior When the Default Property Is True</h3>
 
<P>
If you set the Default property of a CommandButton to True, the following
events occur, depending on which control has focus when you press ENTER
during run time.
<P>
<PRE> Control with focus             Event
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------

 CommandButton (default=False)  Click and KeyDown (KeyDown has higher
                                precedence) events for this CommandButton
                                occur. (The default CommandButton is NOT
                                activated.)

 CommandButton (default=True)   Click, KeyDown or KeyUp (KeyDown has
                                highest precedence) events for this
                                CommandButton occur.

 Any control other than a       The default CommandButton is given the
 CommandButton                  focus and the Click or KeyUp (Click has
                                higher precedence) events for this
                                CommandButton occur.

</PRE>NOTE: The KeyDown event occurs when you press a key while the UserForm or
control on the UserForm has the focus. The KeyUp event occurs after any
event (KeyDown) for a control is started by pressing a key.
<P>
If you want a specific control on the UserForm to have the focus when you
display the UserForm, set the TabIndex property for the control to zero (0)
or use the SetFocus method.
<P>
<P><h3>Setting the TabIndex Property</h3>
 
<P>
If you set the TabIndex property of a control to a value of zero (0), the
control is given the focus when you display the UserForm. The TabIndex
property specifies the position of the object in the tab order (the order
in which the focus moves from one object to another when you press TAB or
SHIFT+TAB).
<P>
<P><h3>Using the SetFocus Method</h3>

</PRE>If you do not want to change the tab order of the controls on the UserForm,
use the SetFocus method to specify which object has focus when you display
the UserForm. For example, if you want a ComboBox named "ComboBox1"
(without the quotation marks) to have the focus when you display the
UserForm, use the following sample code for the Initialize event of the
UserForm:
<P>
<PRE>   Private Sub UserForm_Initialize()

       ComboBox1.SetFocus

   End Sub

</PRE>When you display the UserForm, the insertion point appears inside the
ComboBox, regardless of the tab order on the UserForm.
