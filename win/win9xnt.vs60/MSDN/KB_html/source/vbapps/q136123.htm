<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
This article demonstrates how to use a single bound control for both
finding records and for entering data in a form. You can use this technique
to find whether the value entered in a field already exists in another
record. If the value does exist in another record, the record containing
that value is displayed. If the value does not exist in another record, you
can continue entering data for the current record.
<P>
This article assumes that you are familiar with Visual Basic for
Applications and with creating Microsoft Access applications using the
programming tools provided with Microsoft Access. For more information
about Visual Basic for Applications, please refer to your version of the
"Building Applications with Microsoft Access" manual.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Access online Help system demonstrates how to use the Combo
Box Wizard to find records in your database by selecting a key value from a
list. (See "Value List," and then "Finding a Record by Selecting a Value
from a List" in the Microsoft Access Help system.) This method is limited
in that it is designed to be used with a control not based on any table or
query (unbound control). The following example demonstrates how to use a
single, bound control to achieve the same functionality.
<P>
NOTE: The field to which the control is bound cannot be a required field,
and it cannot have a validation rule that allows Null values. Make sure
that the field's Required property is set to No and that its ValidationRule
property does not allow Null values.
<P>
To use a single bound control for both finding records and for entering
data in a form, follow these steps:

</PRE><P><LI>Open the Customers form in Design view, and set the properties for the

</PRE>
<P><LI>View the Customers form in Form view. In the CustomerID field, type
   "AROUT" (without the quotation marks), and then press ENTER. Note that
   Microsoft Access finds and displays the Around The Horn customer.

<P><LI>In the CustomerID field, type "POPSI" (without the quotation marks),
   and then press ENTER. Because this key value does not exist, you can
   continue entering data for the record.
<P>
</OL><h3>How the Sample Functions Work</h3>
 
<P>
The Find_BeforeUpdate() function uses the FindFirst method to search the
recordset the form is based on to see if the value entered in the control
exists in the table.
<P>
If the value does not exist, the global variable Found is set to NULL and
the function exits. If the value does exist, the global variable Found is
set to the bookmark of the found record to be used by the Find_OnExit()
function.
<P>
Before the found record can be presented, the BeforeUpdate event must be
canceled, and a SendKeys action must send two ESC keys to undo changes to
the current record.
<P>
Next, the SendKeys action sends a TAB key to exit the field. This event
triggers the Find_OnExit() function, which checks to see if the find was
successful. If it was, the CancelEvent action is run to prevent exiting the
control, and then the form record is synchronized with the found record by
setting its bookmark equal to the bookmark of the found record. Found is
then reset back to NULL.
