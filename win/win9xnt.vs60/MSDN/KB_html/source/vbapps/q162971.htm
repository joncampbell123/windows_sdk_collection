<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you declare a public variable on a Visual Basic for Applications code
module that is associated with an object, such as a UserForm or a Worksheet
object, only the procedures in the code module in which you declare the
variable can access the value the variable stores.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
A variable that you declare with the Public statement in code modules that
are associated with an object, such as a UserForm and Worksheet object, is
available only to the module in which you declare it.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
If you want to access a public variable in all procedures in all modules of
a project, declare the variable on a general module. To insert a general
module in a project, click Module on the Insert menu.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design of Microsoft Excel 97.
<P>

<P>
The following examples demonstrate the difference between declaring a
public variable in a general module and declaring a public variable in a
code module that is associated with an object.
<P>
<P><h3>Declaring a Public Variable in a Code Module Associated with an Object</h3>
 
<P>
The following example declares a public variable in a code module that is
associated with an object:

<OL><P><LI>Save and close any open workbooks, and then create a new workbook.

<P><LI>Start the Visual Basic Editor (press ALT+F11).

<P><LI>In the Project Explorer window, double-click Sheet1.
<P>
    This step displays the code module associated with Sheet1.

<P><LI>Type the following code in this module:
<P>
       Public gMyVar As Integer
<P>
       Private Sub Worksheet_SelectionChange(ByVal Target As Excel.Range)
<P>
<PRE>          gMyVar = gMyVar + 1
          MsgBox gMyVar

       End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>On the Insert menu, click Module.
<P>
    This step inserts a general module into your project.

<P><LI>Type the following code in this module:
<P>
<PRE>        Sub General_Module()

           gMyVar = gMyVar + 1
           MsgBox gMyVar

        End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>Press ALT+F11 to switch to Microsoft Excel, and then click Sheet1.

<P><LI>Click any cell other than the current cell in Sheet1.
<P>
    A message box appears with the current value of the variable "gMyVar."

<P><LI>Click OK to dismiss the message box.

<P><LI>Repeat steps 8 and 9 several times until the value that is displayed in
    the message box is incremented to 5.

<P><LI>Run the General_Module macro.
<P>
    A message box that displays the value 1 appears. This is the value
    of gMyVar in the general module. The value is 1 because the
    General_Module macro can not access the public variable gMyVar that you
    declared in the code module associated with Sheet1.

<P><LI>Select a different cell in Sheet1.
<P>
    A message box that displays the current value of gMyVar from the code
    module associated with Sheet1 appears.
<P>
</OL><h3>Declaring a Public Variable in the General Module</h3>
 
<P>
The following example declares a public variable in the general module:

<OL><P><LI>Start the Visual Basic Editor.

<P><LI>Cut the following line
<P>
<P><PRE>      Public gMyVar As Integer
</PRE><P>
   from the module associated with Sheet1 and paste it into the general
   declarations section of the general module.

<P><LI>Switch to Microsoft Excel and click any cell other than the current
   cell in Sheet1.
<P>
   A message box that displays the current value of the variable gMyVar
   appears.

<P><LI>Click OK to dismiss the message box.

<P><LI>Repeat steps 3 and 4 several times until the value that is displayed in
   the message box is incremented to 5.

<P><LI>Run the General_Module macro.
<P>
   A message box that displays a value that is one more than the value
   that appears in step 5 appears. Because the variable gMyVar is a public
   variable that is declared on a general module, any module in the project
   can access its value.
