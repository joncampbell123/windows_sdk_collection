<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use a macro to open a template, you may receive one of the
following errors:
<P>
<PRE>   - Run-time error '-2147467259(80004005):
     Method 'Visible' of object 'CommandBar failed

     -or-

   - Run-time error '7':
     Out of memory

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs if an AutoNew or AutoOpen macro is attempting to make a
toolbar visible that has the same name of a toolbar that is currently
displayed.
<P>
For example,
<P>
<PRE>   If you have a template named Template1 that contains a toolbar named
   "Custom 1" and an AutoOpen macro that makes this toolbar visible when a
   document that is based on this template is opened.

   -and-

   You also have a template named Template2 which contains a toolbar also
   named "Custom 1," and an AutoOpen macro that displays this toolbar.

</PRE>When you open "Template1" or a document based on "Template1", the AutoOpen
macro runs and displays the "Custom 1" toolbar. If you then open
"Template2" or a document based on "Template2", you receive one of the
error messages listed in the "Symptoms" section of this article.
<P>

language being demonstrated and the tools used to create and debug
procedures. Microsoft support engineers can help explain the functionality

provide added functionality or construct procedures to meet your specific
needs. If you have limited programming experience, you may want to contact
the Microsoft fee-based consulting line at (800) 936-5200. For more
information about the support options available from Microsoft, please see

   <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/support/supportnet/refguide/default.asp">http://www.microsoft.com/support/supportnet/refguide/default.asp</A></B>

</PRE>To prevent these errors from occurring, use one of the following methods.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1: Remove or Disable the Command That Displays the Toolbar</h3>
 
<P>
Edit the auto macro in one or both of the templates to remove or disable
the command that displays the toolbar.
<P>
For example, the command line that may be causing the error may be either
of the following.
<P>
<PRE>   Macro converted from WordBasic:

      WordBasic.ViewToolBars Toolbar:="Custom 1", Show:=1


   Visual Basic for Applications macro:

      CommandBars("Custom 1").Visible = True

</PRE>Adding an apostrophe at the beginning of either line will disable the
command.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 2: Rename One ToolBar to a Unique Name</h3>
 
<P>
Rename one of the toolbars to a unique name and edit the macro of the same
template to reference the changed toolbar name.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 3: Add an Error Trap for the Error</h3>
 
<P>
Adding an error trap will prevent the error if Word attempts to display
both toolbars at the same time.
<P>
NOTE: Using an error trap will skip the command to display the second
toolbar. As a workaround, you can choose Toolbars on the View menu to
display the toolbar without receiving an error.
<P>
The following is an example of an error trap that can be used in this case:
<P>
<PRE>   On Error Resume Next
   CommandBars("Custom 1").Visible = True

</PRE>For more information about error trapping, click the Office Assistant while
in the Visual Basic Editor, type "error trap," click Search, and then click
to view "On Error Statement."
<P>
NOTE: If the Assistant is hidden, click the Office Assistant button on the
Standard toolbar. If the Assistant is not able to answer your query, please
see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../vbapps/q176476.htm">Q176476</A></B>
   TITLE     : OFF: Office Assistant Not Answering Visual Basic Questions

</PRE><h3>Method 4: Check the Visible state of the toolbar</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   ' If the Custom toolbar is not visible then...
   If CommandBars("Custom 1").Visible = False Then
      ' ...make the Custom toolbar visible.
      CommandBars("Custom 1").Visible = True
   End If

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
