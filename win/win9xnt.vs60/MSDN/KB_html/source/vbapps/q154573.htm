The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access version 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multiuser skills.
<P>
The order of report event procedures change when you open an "instance" of
a report.
<P>
When opening an "instance" of a report, the OnOpen event of the report
occurs after the report has already bound to the data or recordset
for the report. Typically, the OnOpen event for reports occurs before the
report has bound to the data or record source, allowing the option of
changing the RecordSource property for the report from this event.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Access 7.0. This
problem no longer occurs in Microsoft Access 97.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When a report is opened from the Database window, the OnOpen event changes
the record source to another table . When an additional report instance is
called from a function, like the one below, an error occurs:
<P>
<PRE>    Run-time error '2191'
    You can't set the RecordSource property after printing has started.

    Solution
    Try setting this property from the OnOpen event.

</PRE>This article assumes that you are familiar with Visual Basic for
Applications and with creating Microsoft Access applications using the
programming tools provided with Microsoft Access. For more information
about Visual Basic for Applications, please refer to the "Building
Applications with Microsoft Access for Windows 95" manual.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Open the sample database Northwind.mdb

<P><LI>Create a copy of the Employees table, and then save it as 2ndEmployees.

<P><LI>Edit the data for the 2ndEmployees table (to distinguish it from the
   first copy).

<P><LI>Using the AutoReport Wizard, create a new report based on the Employees
   table, and save it as MyReport.

<P><LI>Open the report, MyReport, in Design view and from the OnOpen event,
   change the report's RecordSource property as follows:
<P>
<P><PRE>       Private Sub Report_Open(Cancel As Integer)
<PRE></PRE>           Me.RecordSource = "2ndEmployees"
       End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>Close and save the report.

<P><LI>In a new module create the following function to open a new instance
   of the report:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Public Function CreateNewReportInstance()
<PRE></PRE>         Static r As Report
         Set r = New Report_MyReport
         r.Visible = True
      End Function

</PRE><P><LI>Run the function from the Debug Window and note that the error message
   occurs.
