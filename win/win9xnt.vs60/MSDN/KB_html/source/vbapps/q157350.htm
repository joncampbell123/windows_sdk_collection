The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Visual Basic for Applications macros in Microsoft Excel 97, when you use
the Text property to read text from a cell, not all of the text contained
in the object is returned.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This will occur if you use the Text property to read text from a cell that
contains more than 1024 characters; the Text property can only read 1024
characters from a cell.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft provides examples of Visual Basic for Applications procedures for
illustration only, without warranty either expressed or implied, including,
but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and/or fitness
for a particular purpose. The Visual Basic procedures in this article are
provided 'as is' and Microsoft does not guarantee that they can be used in
all situations. While Microsoft support engineers can help explain the
functionality of a particular macro, they will not modify these examples to
provide added functionality, nor will they help you construct macros to
meet your specific needs. If you have limited programming experience, you
may want to consult one of the Microsoft Solution Providers. Solution
Providers offer a wide range of fee-based services, including creating
custom macros. For more information about Microsoft Solution Providers,
call Microsoft Customer Information Service at (800) 426-9400.
<P>
If there is a chance that a cell will contain more than 1024 characters,
use the Value property to read the text from the cell. The Value property
can read up to 32767 characters from a cell.
<P>
For example, if you want to read the text from cell A1, when cell A1
contains more than 1024 characters, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Enter the following macro code into a module sheet:
<P>
<PRE>      Sub Read_Text()

          MyVar = Range("A1").Value
          MsgBox MyVar

      End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>Run the Read_Text macro.
<P>
</OL>A message box with the text from cell A1 will be displayed.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design of Microsoft Excel 97.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
You can use the Text property in Microsoft Excel to read text from cells:
<P>
<PRE>   MyVar = Range("A1").Text

</PRE></OL>In earlier versions of Microsoft Excel, the problem described above does
not occur, since cells can only contain up to 256 characters.
<P>
However, Microsoft Excel 97 allows up to 32767 characters per cell. Because
of this, the Text property may not work as expected when you use it to read
a cell that contains more than 1024 characters.
