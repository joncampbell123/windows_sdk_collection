<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run a Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications procedure or macro
that was converted from a WordBasic procedure or macro that contained error
trapping, the error trap is ignored though it worked as expected when run
in WordBasic.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft provides programming examples for illustration only, without

language being demonstrated and the tools used to create and debug
procedures. Microsoft support engineers can help explain the functionality
of a particular procedure, but they will not modify these examples to
provide added functionality or construct procedures to meet your specific
needs. If you have limited programming experience, you may want to contact
the Microsoft fee-based consulting line at (800) 936-5200. For more
information about the support options available from Microsoft, please see

</PRE>By design, the On Error statement in Visual Basic works differently from
WordBasic. In Visual Basic, On Error is not cleared when an error occurs,
while in WordBasic, the On Error statement is cleared, the error trap is
reset, and your code continues to run.
<P>
Therefore, the following sample converted WordBasic code fails when an
error occurs the second time.
<P>
<PRE>   Sub Main()

      ' Clear error trap. Set error trap.
      On Error GoTo -1: On Error GoTo ErrorTrap

      ' Loop 10 times.
      For i = 1 To 10

         ' Artificially raise an error.
         Err.Raise 5

   ErrorTrap:

        ' Decision tree based on error returned.
        If Err.Number = 0 Then

            ' If no error occurred, do this...
            count_ = count_ + 1

        Else

            ' Else, if error occurred, do this...
            Err.Number = 0

        End If
      Next

   End Sub

</PRE><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this issue, make the On Error statement the first statement
inside the loop.
<P>
<PRE>   Sub Main()

      ' Loop 10 times.
      For i = 1 To 10

      ' Clear error trap. Set error trap.
      On Error GoTo -1: On Error GoTo ErrorTrap

         ' Artificially raise an error.
         Err.Raise 5

   ErrorTrap:

        ' Decision tree based on error returned.
        If Err.Number = 0 Then

            ' If no error occurred, do this...
            count_ = count_ + 1

        Else

            ' Else if error occurred, do this...
            Err.Number = 0

        End If
      Next

   End Sub

</PRE>In this example, the Err.Raise statement artificially raises an error for
demonstration purposes. When the error occurs and the next iteration of the
loop occurs, the "On Error GoTo -1" statement clears the error trap and the
"On Error GoTo ErrorTrap" statement resets the error trap. The loop
continues to process without interruption until it completes the designated
number of iterations (10).

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
