<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When timing code to identify performance bottlenecks, you want to use the
highest resolution timer the system has to offer. This article describes
how to use the QueryPerformanceCounter function to time application code.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Several timers of differing accuracy are offered by the operating system:

TimeGetTime              milliseconds               approx. 10 ms
</PRE>QueryPerformanceCounter  QueryPerformanceFrequency  same
<P>
If your system supports a high-resolution counter, you can use
QueryPerformanceCounter and QueryPerformanceFrequency to do high-resolution
timings.
<P>
The following sample code compares the various counters:

<P><PRE>      timeGetTime minimum resolution:  10 ms
      Took 1565 loops

</OL>Multiple statements execute before either GetTickCount or timeGetTime
record a change. The actual number of loops will vary depending on the
background tasks the operating system is executing.
<P>
On the other hand, QueryPerformanceCounter changes value between successive
API calls, indicating its usefulness in high-resolution timing. The
resolution in this case is on the order of a microsecond. Because the
resolution is system-dependent, there are no standard units that it
measures. You have to divide the difference by the
QueryPerformanceFrequency to determine the number of seconds elapsed. In
the case above, the overhead for just calling the API is about 19
microseconds. This would have to be subtracted when timing other code as
follows:
<P>
<PRE>   Private Sub Time_Addition()
   Dim Ctr1 As Currency, Ctr2 As Currency, Freq As Currency
   Dim Overhead As Currency, A As Long, I As Long
     QueryPerformanceFrequency Freq
     QueryPerformanceCounter Ctr1
     QueryPerformanceCounter Ctr2
     Overhead = Ctr2 - Ctr1        ' determine API overhead
     QueryPerformanceCounter Ctr1  ' time loop
     For I = 1 To 100
       A = A + I
     Next I
     QueryPerformanceCounter Ctr2
     Debug.Print "("; Ctr1; "-"; Ctr2; "-"; Overhead; ") /"; Freq
     Debug.Print "100 additions took";
     Debug.Print (Ctr2 - Ctr1 - Overhead) / Freq; "seconds"
   End Sub

</PRE></OL>Sample output:
<P>
<PRE>   ( 3630876.6256 - 3630876.6388 - 0.0013 ) / 119.3182
   100 additions took 9.97333181358753E-05 seconds

</PRE>NOTE: Because currency variables are used, the values returned are 10000
times smaller than the actual counters. Because the calculation of seconds
involves a division operation, this factor is cancelled out.
