<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you refer to the UserForms collection in a Visual Basic for
Applications macro, you may receive one of the following error messages:
<P>
<PRE>   Run-time error '13':
   Type mismatch

   -or-

   Run-time error '9':
   Subscript out of range

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The UserForms collection is a collection of currently loaded UserForms;
however, it does not provide its list as a property of the collection.
Therefore, a statement such as UserForms(1).Show returns run-time error 9.
In order to refer to an item in the UserForms collection, you must first
add the UserForm list element to the UserForms collection.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft provides examples of Visual Basic for Applications procedures for
illustration only, without warranty either expressed or implied, including,
but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and/or fitness
for a particular purpose. The Visual Basic procedures in this article are
provided 'as is' and Microsoft does not guarantee that they can be used in
all situations. While Microsoft support engineers can help explain the
functionality of a particular macro, they will not modify these examples to
provide added functionality, nor will they help you construct macros to
meet your specific needs. If you have limited programming experience, you
may want to consult one of the Microsoft Solution Providers. Solution
Providers offer a wide range of fee-based services, including creating
custom macros. For more information about Microsoft Solution Providers,

<P>
To refer to a UserForm within a UserForms collection and return a property
or method for the UserForm, use either of the following methods.
<P>
Method 1: Create a UserForm Object
<P>
<PRE>          The following subroutine displays a UserForm that already is
          created.

          Sub ShowForm()
              'Create an object called "x" to refer to UserForm1.
              set x = VBA.UserForms.Add("UserForm1")
              'Display the name of UserForm1.
              MsgBox x.Name
              'Show UserForm1.
              x.Show
          End Sub

</PRE>Method 2: Refer Directly to the UserForm
<P>
<PRE>          The following two statements dispaly a UserForm that already is
          created.

          UserForm1.Show

          -or-

          VBA.UserForms.Add("UserForm1").Show

</PRE>Method 3: Reference the Item Property (index) of the UserForm
<P>
<PRE>          The following subroutine displays a UserForm that already is
          created.

          Sub ShowForm()

              'Open UserForm1 into memory.
              Load UserForm1
              'Count the loaded UserForms and subtract one
              'because UserForm indexes start at zero.
              x = UserForms.Count - 1
              'Show UserForm1.
              UserForms.Items(x).Show

          End Sub

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
