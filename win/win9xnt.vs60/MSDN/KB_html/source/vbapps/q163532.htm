<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use a For Each...Next statement to loop through and remove all
shapes on a specified slide, some shapes are not deleted. For example, the
following code does not delete all the shapes on a slide.
<P>
<PRE>   For Each shapeObject In ActivePresentation.Slides(1).Shapes
      shapeObject.Delete
   Next shapeObject

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When you use a For Each...Next statement in a Microsoft Visual Basic for
Applications procedure, the procedure keeps track of each shape that it
finds. When it finds the first shape, it knows that the next shape is the
second shape on the slide. However, when it finds the first shape and then
deletes it, the next shape becomes the first shape on the slide.
Consequently, each subsequent shape on the slide is assigned a new
position.

</PRE>As the following sample Visual Basic procedure demonstrates, you can
replace the For Each...Next statement with a Do...Loop statement (including
the While keyword) to remove all the shapes on a slide.
<P>
<PRE>   Sub DeleteAllShapes()

      ' Delete every shape on slide 1.
      With ActivePresentation.Slides(1)
         While (.Shapes.Count &gt; 0)
            .Shapes(1).Delete
         Wend
      End With

   End Sub
