<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition, it is possible for a Visual Basic
for Applications macro to display a UserForm with a name that is stored in
a variable. This article explains how to do this.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft provides programming examples for illustration only, without
warranty either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the
implied warranties of merchantability and/or fitness for a particular
purpose. This article assumes that you are familiar with the programming
language being demonstrated and the tools used to create and debug
procedures. Microsoft support engineers can help explain the functionality
of a particular procedure, but they will not modify these examples to
provide added functionality or construct procedures to meet your specific
needs. If you have limited programming experience, you may want to contact
the Microsoft fee-based consulting line at (800) 936-5200. For more
information about the support options available from Microsoft, please see
the following page on the World Wide Web:
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/supportnet/refguide/">http://www.microsoft.com/supportnet/refguide/</A></B>

</PRE>In all following examples, the UserForm being used is called "UserForm1"
(without the quotation marks).
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition, if you want a Visual Basic macro
to display UserForm1, the line of code to use is the following:
<P>
<PRE>   UserForm1.Show

</PRE>Although this syntax is very simple, it can cause problems if you want to
show a UserForm with a name that is stored in a variable. For example, if
the variable "x" contains the name of the UserForm, you cannot simply use
the following procedure
<P>
<PRE>   Sub Test()
       x = "UserForm1"
       x.Show
   End Sub

</PRE>to display UserForm1.
<P>
If you run this macro, you receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Run-time error '424'
   Object Required

</PRE><h3>UserForm Name Stored in a Variable</h3>
 
<P>
If you want to show a UserForm with a name that is stored in a variable,
use the following code:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub ShowUserForm1()
       X = "UserForm1"
       VBA.UserForms.Add(X).Show
   End Sub

</PRE><h3>User Prompted for UserForm Name</h3>
 
<P>
To ask a user what UserForm to display, use the InputBox method as in the
following procedure:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub ShowUserForm2()
       X = InputBox("Show which UserForm?: ")
       VBA.UserForms.Add(X).Show
   End Sub

</PRE><h3>UserForm Name Retrieved from Worksheet Cell</h3>
 
<P>
You can read a value from a cell in a worksheet by using the following
procedure:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub ShowUserForm3()

       'Cell A1 of Sheet1 contains the name of the UserForm
       X = ActiveWorkbook.Sheets("Sheet1").Cells(1, 1).Value

       VBA.UserForms.Add(X).Show
   End Sub

</PRE><h3>Prompt for Index Number to Display UserForm</h3>
 
<P>
You can include a list of UserForm names in your macro and set the value of
"X" to the UserForm that corresponds to an index number.
<P>
NOTE: The following example assumes that there are three UserForms in the
project: UserForm1, UserForm2, and UserForm3. You may want to insert some
macro code to make sure the value entered is between 1 and 3, inclusive.
<P>
<PRE>   Sub ShowUserForm4()

       'Display an input box asking for a number between 1 and 3
       '(inclusive).
       Y = Application.InputBox (Prompt:="enter 1, 2, or 3", Type:=1)

       'Based on the number entered in the input box, X will be set to
       'the appropriate string.

       Select Case Y
           Case 1
               X = "UserForm1"
           Case 2
               X = "UserForm2"
           Case Else
               X = "UserForm3"
       End Select

       VBA.UserForms.Add(X).Show
   End Sub

</PRE>In each case above, the UserForm you want to show must exist. If it does
not exist in the project, you receive the following error message
<P>
<PRE>   Run-time error '424'

</PRE>and the macro halts.
