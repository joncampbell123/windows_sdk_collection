<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run a Visual Basic for Applications macro in Microsoft Excel 97,
if the macro contains a command that unhides a row in a worksheet, you may
receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down.
   If the problem persists, contact the program vendor.

</PRE>If you click Details, you receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   EXCEL caused an invalid page fault in module EXCEL.EXE at
   014f:30111ca6.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may occur when the worksheet contains a very large number of
hidden rows (usually, greater than 32768 rows) and you attempt to unhide a
row by setting the Hidden property of the row to False. The following is an
example of code that may cause the macro to fail:
<P>
<PRE>   Selection.EntireRow.Hidden = False

</PRE><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft provides examples of Visual Basic for Applications procedures for
illustration only, without warranty either expressed or implied, including,
but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and/or fitness
for a particular purpose. The Visual Basic procedures in this article are
provided 'as is' and Microsoft does not guarantee that they can be used in
all situations. While Microsoft support engineers can help explain the
functionality of a particular macro, they will not modify these examples to
provide added functionality, nor will they help you construct macros to
meet your specific needs. If you have limited programming experience, you
may want to consult one of the Microsoft Solution Providers. Solution
Providers offer a wide range of fee-based services, including creating
custom macros. For more information about Microsoft Solution Providers,
call Microsoft Customer Information Service at (800) 426-9400.
<P>
To prevent this problem from occurring, do not set the Hidden property of
an entire row to False if a very large number of rows are hidden in the
worksheet. Instead, set the RowHeight property of the row equal to an
appropriate value. For example, to set the height of a hidden row to 12,
use the following line of code:
<P>
<PRE>   Selection.EntireRow.RowHeight = 12

</PRE>Alternatively, use the following line of code:
<P>
<PRE>   Selection.EntireRow.RowHeight = Selection.Offset(-1, 0).RowHeight

</PRE>This code sets the height of the hidden row equal to the height of the row
immediately above it.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
You can use the Hidden property whenever you want to hide or unhide an
entire row or column in a worksheet. For example, to hide the row that
contains the active cell, use the following line of code:
<P>
<PRE>   ActiveCell.EntireRow.Hidden = True

</PRE>To unhide a hidden row, set the Hidden property for that row to False. To
do this, use the following line of code:
<P>
<PRE>   ActiveCell.EntireRow.Hidden = False

</PRE>This line of code may fail if more than half of the rows in the worksheet
are hidden.
