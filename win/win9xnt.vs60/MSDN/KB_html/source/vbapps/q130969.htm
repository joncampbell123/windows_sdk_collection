The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Project for Windows, version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Project for Macintosh, version 4.0
</UL>

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Project will generate an application error when you run a macro
that is designed to merge a file into an active, combined project. This
situation applies to combined windows and projects that have been
consolidated and attached to source files.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
When you use a macro to import a file, load the file without merging it.
This will create a new "project" with the imported information. In
Visual Basic for Applications, the command would be similar to the
following example:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub import()
       FileOpen Name:="Filename.txt", Merge:=pjDoNotMerge, _
       TaskInformation:=true
   End Sub

</PRE>The constant pjDoNotMerge will force the imported information (either
Text, .CSV, and so on) into a new project.
<P>
NOTE: When this procedure is done manually, Microsoft Project does
not allow merging at all. When you do it via a macro, however, any file
type other than MPX or MPP will cause this problem.
<P>
Microsoft provides examples of Visual Basic procedures for illustration
only, without warranty either expressed or implied, including but not
limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and/or fitness for a
particular purpose. This Visual Basic procedure is provided 'as is' and
Microsoft does not guarantee that it can be used in all situations.
Microsoft does not support modifications of this procedure to suit customer
requirements for a particular purpose.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post
new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
A combined window of projects, in Microsoft Project is not a project in
itself, but it is an image of selected projects combined in a separate
window pane. Importing and merging a file requires the active window to be
a true "project."
<P>
You cannot merge information into a consolidated project file (that is, a
file that attaches itself to source project).
