<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, you can create a macro that will be called only when a 
value is entered into a cell in a particular sheet or in any sheet that is 
currently open.
<P>
Note, however, that you should not call macros unnecessarily because they 
will slow down the performance of Microsoft Excel.
<P>

<P>
<PRE>   <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/support/supportnet/refguide/default.asp">http://www.microsoft.com/support/supportnet/refguide/default.asp</A></B>

</PRE>In many instances, a macro should run only when a certain number of cells 
have values entered into them (referred to as the "key cells" in this 
document). In order to prevent a large macro from running every time a 
value is entered into a cell of a sheet, you must check to see if the 
ActiveCell is one of the key cells. This can be accomplished by using the 
Intersect method on the ActiveCell and the range containing the key cells 
to verify the ActiveCell is one of the key cells. If the ActiveCell is in 
the range containing the key cells, you can call the macro.
<P>
To run this sample macro, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Open a new workbook.

<P><LI>On Sheet1 in cell A11, type the following formula:
<P>
<P><PRE>      =SUM(A1:A10)
</PRE>
<P><LI>Copy this formula to cells B11, C11, and D11.
<P>
   In the example used here, the macro will cause the background color
   of cells A11, B11, and C11 to change to red (or ColorIndex 3) if that
   cell's value is larger than 50; otherwise, the cell's background color
   will be normal. This is accomplished by checking for entries in
   cells A1:A10, B1:B10, and C1:C10. Each time an entry is made in
   any cell on Sheet1, the DidKeyCellsChange macro will run. This macro
   decides if the ActiveCell is in the range of key cells (A1:C10). If
   it is, the KeyCellsChanged macro is called to re-evaluate cells
   A11:C11.
<P>
   The following macros work together to perform this functionality.
   The "Auto_Open" macro must be run once in order for the other macros
   to be called.

<P><LI>Insert a new module sheet. In Microsoft Excel 97, on the Tools menu,
   point to Macro, and then click Visual Basic Editor. In the Editor, click 
   Module on the Insert menu. In Microsoft Excel versions 5.0 and 7.0,
   point to Macro on the Insert menu, and then click Module.

<P><LI>Type the following macro code into the module sheet:
<P>
<PRE>      Sub auto_open()

         ' Run the macro DidCellsChange any time a entry is made in a
         ' cell in Sheet1.
         ThisWorkbook.Worksheets("Sheet1").OnEntry = "DidCellsChange"

      End Sub


      Sub DidCellsChange()
        Dim KeyCells as String
         ' Define which cells should trigger the KeyCellsChanged macro.
         KeyCells = "A1:A10, B1:B10, C1:C10"

         ' If the Activecell is one of the key cells, call the
         ' KeyCellsChanged macro.
         If Not Application.Intersect(ActiveCell, Range(KeyCells)) _
         Is Nothing Then KeyCellsChanged

      End Sub

      Sub KeyCellsChanged()
         Dim Cell as Object
         ' If the values in A11:C11 are greater than 50...
         For Each Cell In Range("A11:C11")
         If Cell &gt; 50 Then

         ' Make the background color of the cell the 3rd color on the
         ' current palette.
         Cell.Interior.ColorIndex = 3

         Else
         ' Otherwise, set the background to none (default).
         Cell.Interior.ColorIndex = xlNone

         End If
         Next Cell

      End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>Save the workbook, and then close it.

<P><LI>Open the workbook.
<P>
   This will cause the Auto_Open macro to run.

<P><LI>In cell A1, type "60" (without the quotation marks).
<P>
   Cell A11 should change to a Red background color because you changed
   a cell in the KeyCells range and the value of cell A11 became greater
   than 50.

<P><LI>In cell D1, type "60" (without the quotation marks).
<P>
   Nothing will happen to the color of D11, even though the value in D11
   is now greater than 50. Nothing happens because cell D1 is not in the
   KeyCells range.
