<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, if you use the SaveAs method of the Workbook object to
save a file, and you save the file with the same name and location as an
existing file, you cannot determine whether the No or the Cancel button is
chosen in the "Replace Existing" dialog box that appears when you save the
file.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the SaveAs method of the Workbook object to save a file, and
the file already exists, both the No and the Cancel button in the "Replace
Existing" dialog box cause the following error message to appear:
<P>
<PRE>   Run-time error '1004':

   SaveAs method of Workbook class failed

</PRE>Because of this behavior, you cannot trap this error, and you cannot
determine in your macro whether the Cancel button was chosen, or the No
button was chosen.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this behavior, you can use the Dir function to determine
whether the file already exists, and then use the MsgBox function to trap
the response to either replace the existing file, or not. The following
macro is an example of this method.

<PRE>   Sub Save_File()
      ' Dimension variables
      Dim FileToSave, ExistFile, Msg As String
      Msg = "File already exists. Save on top of existing file?"
      ' Define name and directory to save active workbook to
      FileToSave = "C:\TEST.XLS"
      ' Check for existing file
      ExistFile = Dir(FileToSave)
      If ExistFile &lt;&gt; "" Then
         If MsgBox(Msg, vbExclamation + vbOKCancel) = vbOK Then
            ' OK chosen, replace following line with desired code
            MsgBox "Save over existing file"
         Else
            ' Cancel chosen, replace following line with desired code
            MsgBox "Cancel save"
         End If
      ' If file does not exist, save file
      Else
         ThisWorkbook.SaveAs ("C:\TEST.XLS")
      End If
