The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Standard, Professional, and Enterprise Editions of Microsoft

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article documents the behavior of top-level Microsoft OLE Automation
objects in Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and Microsoft Project when
manipulated by the Visual Basic CreateObject() and GetObject() functions.
<P>
Because only the products and versions listed at the beginning of this
article support OLE 2.0 Automation, the version-dependent top-level OLE
Automation objects, such as Excel.Application.5, function the same way as
the version-independent top-level OLE automation objects such as
Excel.Application. Therefore, only the version-independent top-level OLE
Automation objects are discussed in this article.
<P>
In addition, this article does not discuss the possibility of other
applications referencing the same objects or the possibility of running
out of resources or memory.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Each Microsoft application that currently supports OLE Automation behaves
differently with respect to how its top-level OLE Automation objects
function. The following sections list the behaviors of each application and
each possible syntax used with each top-level OLE Automation objects within
that application.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Excel Versions 5.0 &amp; 7.0</h3>
 

<UL><LI>Excel exposes three top-level OLE Automation objects (Application,
   Sheet, and Chart).
<LI>Excel supports multiple instances.
<LI>New instances of Excel created through top-level OLE Automation objects
   are invisible. They can be made visible by setting the visible property
   of the application object to True (...Application.Visible = True).
<LI>In some cases, Excel creates invisible Workbooks. They can be made
   visible by setting the visible property of the window to true
   (...Window(n).Visible = True).
<LI>In some cases, Excel does not create a workbook. To create one, use the
   add method of the Workbooks collection (...Workbooks.Add).
<LI>To remove an instance of Excel from memory, you must use the quit method
   of the application object (...Application.Quit).
<P>
</UL><h3>Syntax Statements for Microsoft Excel Versions 5.0 &amp; 7.0 Application Object</h3>
 
<P>
Set Obj = CreateObject("Excel.Application")

<UL><LI>Creates a new invisible instance of Excel.
<LI>No workbooks are loaded.
<P>
</UL>Set Obj = GetObject("", "Excel.Application")

<UL><LI>Creates a new invisible instance of Excel.
<LI>No workbooks are loaded.
<P>
</UL>Set Obj = GetObject(, "Excel.Application")

<UL><LI>Tries to get an existing instance of Excel at random. If an instance
   is found, Obj points to it.
<LI>Fails if there is not an existing instance.
<P>
</UL><h3>Syntax Statements for Microsoft Excel Versions 5.0 &amp; 7.0 Sheet Object</h3>
 
<P>
Set Obj = CreateObject("Excel.Sheet")

<UL><LI>If there are no instances of Excel, a new invisible instance of Excel
   is created with a workbook named "Object" containing one worksheet
   named "Sheet1."
<LI>If one instance of Excel exists, a new visible workbook is added
   named "Object" containing one worksheet named "Sheet1."
<LI>If multiple instances of Excel exist, a new workbook is added to one
   instance chosen at random. The workbook name is "Object" and it
   contains one worksheet named "Sheet1."
<LI>If Obj goes out of scope, the workbook is removed. However, the
   instance of Excel remains in memory.
<P>
</UL>Set Obj = GetObject("", "Excel.Sheet")

<UL><LI>If there are no instances of Excel, a new invisible instance of Excel
   is created with a workbook named "Object" containing one worksheet
   named "Sheet1."
<LI>If one instance of Excel exists, a new workbook is added named
   "Object" containing one worksheet named "Sheet1."
<LI>If multiple instances of Excel exist, a new workbook is added to one
   instance chosen at random. The workbook name is "Object," and it
   contains one worksheet named "Sheet1."
<LI>If Obj goes out of scope, the workbook is removed. However, the
   instance of Excel remains in memory.

</UL>Set Obj = GetObject(, "Excel.Sheet")

<UL><LI>Always fails.
<P>
</UL>Set Obj = GetObject("C:\BOOK.XLS", "Excel.Sheet")

<UL><LI>If no instances of Excel exists, a new invisible instance is created
   with an invisible workbook.
<LI>If one instance of Excel exists, a new invisible workbook is loaded.
   If the loaded instance already has the specified workbook loaded,
   that workbook is used.
<LI>If more than one instance of Excel is loaded, a new invisible
   workbook is loaded into one at random. If one of the instances
   already has the specified workbook open, an error occurs unless
   the random instance chosen is the one using the specified workbook.
<LI>Obj points to the first worksheet in the specified workbook.
<LI>Fails if workbook does not exist.
<LI>When Obj goes out of scope, the instance of Excel stays loaded in
   memory. However, the specified workbook will be unloaded unless the
   invisible workbook was made visible.

   is created with a workbook named "Object" containing one chart named
   "Chart1" and one worksheet named "Sheet1."
<LI>If one instance of Excel exists, a new workbook is added named
   "Object" containing one chart named "Chart1" and one worksheet named
   "Sheet1" by default.
<LI>If multiple instances of Excel exist, a new Workbook is added to one
   instance chosen at random. The workbook's default name is "Object,"
   and it contains one chart named "Chart1" and one worksheet named
   "Sheet1."

   with an invisible workbook.
<LI>If one instance of Excel exists, an invisible workbook is loaded. If
   the loaded instance already has the specified workbook loaded, that
   workbook is used.
<LI>If more than one instance of Excel is loaded, an invisible workbook
   is loaded into one at random. If one of the instances already running
   has the specified workbook open an error occurs unless the random
   instance chosen is the one using the specified workbook.
<LI>Obj points to the first chart in the workbook.
<LI>Fails if workbook does not exist.
<LI>When Obj goes out of scope, the instance of Excel stays loaded in
   memory. However, the specified workbook will be unloaded unless the
   invisible workbook was made visible.

<UL><LI>Word exposes one top level OLE Automation object (Basic).
<LI>Word supports multiple instances.
<LI>Instances of Word created with its top level OLE Automation object are
   visible.

   If the specific project was already loaded, the statement will fail.
<LI>Fails if project file does not exist.
<P>
</UL>NOTE: When an object variable goes out of scope, it is de-referenced. The
object reference count is de-cremented, and if it reaches zero, the object
can be removed from memory. You can explicitly de-reference an object by
setting it to nothing (Set Obj = Nothing). This should have the same effect
as the object variable going out of scope.
