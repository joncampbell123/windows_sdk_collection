<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, version 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Schedule+ 7.0 accounts can be created as Resource Accounts, for example
Conference Rooms, Overhead Projectors, Company Vehicles, etc. These
Resources can also be configured to automatically accept meeting requests
and clear canceled meetings from their appointment book.
<P>
NOTE: Auto-booking of appointments does not work when you send meeting
requests between Microsoft Mail for PC Networks postoffices and Microsoft
Exchange Server version 4.0 environments. Mail for PC Networks does not
support Bcc: recipients.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
By placing the Resource account into the RESOURCE address box of the
Meeting Attendees dialog box, it will place the ResourceID in the Bcc: line
of the meeting request message. The ResourceID will also be displayed in
the Where: field of the meeting request message. Schedule+ will only search
for users listed in the Bcc: box to perform the auto-booking of
appointments. This eliminates overhead of parsing addresses, locating the
appointment book, determining the Account-type (Resource or not) and
accessing permissions to all users; therefore, it improves performance.
<P>
NOTE: Entering ResourceIDs into any address box other than that of a
Resource Attendee (for example, Required or Optional) will disable the Auto-
booking features.
<P>
<P><h3>Setting Up the Resource Account</h3>
