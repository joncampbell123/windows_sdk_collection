The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Open Database Connectivity, version 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If you use the ODBC 3.0 Driver Manager trace facility with the Odbctrac.dll
file that comes with ODBC 3.0, user names and passwords used for
connections may be logged without encryption in the trace log.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
You can prevent an ODBC 3.0 Driver Manager trace on computers either by
removing the Odbctrac.dll file or by replacing it with a zero-length file
of the same name. If tracing is attempted afterwards, the following message
may appear:
<P>
<PRE>   General Error: either odbctrac.dll is not an ODBC tracing dll
   or it is obsolete.

</PRE>With ODBC version 3.0 Service Pack 1, the user names and passwords are
displayed as "******" in the trace log. Also, the trace DLL must be in the
System directory on computers running Windows 95 or the System32 directory
on computers running Windows NT. If the trace DLL is located elsewhere,
tracing will not occur, and the message described above may appear.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The ODBC 3.0 Driver Manager trace facility is provided as a debugging tool
for diagnosing a wide range of ODBC issues, including database
connectivity. In many debugging instances, it is necessary to determine
what user name and password were used to establish the connection to the
database. The ODBC 3.0 Driver Manager trace logs the user name and password
to allow for comprehensive debugging of ODBC issues, and is the ODBC 3.0
replacement for the Driver Manager trace facility and ODBC SPY trace
program for ODBC 2.x. The ODBC SPY trace program also logs the user name
and password used in a connection.
<P>
The proper use of the ODBC 3.0 tracing facility is documented in the ODBC
3.0 Programmer's Reference Guide in Chapter 17, "Programming
Considerations," under the section for Tracing.
