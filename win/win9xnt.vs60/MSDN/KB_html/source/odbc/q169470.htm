<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article covers some of the most frequently asked questions about ODBC
connection pooling.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 

<PRE>1. Q. What is ODBC connection pooling?

   A. Connection pooling is one the new features introduced in ODBC 3.0.
      Connection pooling enables an ODBC application to reuse a connection
      from a pool of connections. Once a connection has been created and
      placed in the pool, an ODBC application can reuse the same driver and
      the connection within the same shared environment (henv) without
      performing the complete connection process. However, a connection can
      never be reused between different henv or different drivers.

2. Q. Can I use connection pooling with 2.x ODBC drivers?

   A. Connection pooling is implemented in the ODBC driver manager version
      3.0 or later. The driver version does not matter.

3. Q. Can I enable connection pooling with the Microsoft Access driver
      because the connection pooling is implemented in the driver manager?

   A. You cannot enable connection pooling with the Microsoft Access
      driver. The Microsoft Access driver internally uses Jet, which
      supports the apartment threaded model. In other words, Jet requires
      the connect/disconnect procedure to be handled by the same thread.
      For connection pooling to work, the connect/disconnect procedure
      needs to be handled by different threads. This applies to all the
      Microsoft Desktop drivers that use Jet.

4. Q. How do I enable connection pooling in an ODBC application?

   A. An ODBC application can call SQLSetEnvAttr with the
      SQL_ATTR_CONNECTION_POOLING attribute to enable connection pooling.
      For more information about how to enable connection pooling in an
      ODBC application, please see the following article in the Microsoft
      Knowledge Base:

      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../odbc/q164221.htm">Q164221</A></B>
      TITLE     : How to Enable Connection Pooling in an ODBC Application

5. Q. How do I enable connection pooling if the application is written in
      Visual Basic?

   A. A Visual Basic or ODBC application can call the SQLSetEnvAttr
      function to enable connection pooling. Connection pooling is a
      process-level attribute, so any subsequent connection made through
      the ODBC driver manager in the Visual Basic application will use
      connection pooling. A Visual Basic application can use the function
      declaration and code to enable connection pooling.

      Declare Function SQLSetEnvAttr Lib "odbc32.dll" (ByVal henv As Long,
      ByVal Attribute As Long, ByVal Value As Long, ByVal StringLength As
      Long) As Integer

      ' env attribute
      Public Const SQL_ATTR_CONNECTION_POOLING = 201
      Public Const SQL_ATTR_CP_MATCH = 202

      ' values for SQL_ATTR_CONNECTION_POOLING
      Public Const SQL_CP_ONE_PER_DRIVER = 1
      Public Const SQL_IS_UINTEGER = -5

      nstatus = SQLSetEnvAttr(0, SQL_ATTR_CONNECTION_POOLING,
      SQL_CP_ONE_PER_DRIVER, SQL_IS_UINTEGER)
      SQLAllocEnv...
      SQLAllocConnect...
      SQLConnect...
      SQLDisConnect...
      SQLFreeConnect...
      SQLFreeEnv...

6. Q. How do I enable connection pooling in an OLE DB application?

   A. An OLE DB application can call SQLSetEnvAttr to enable connection
      pooling.


      For more information about how to enable connection pooling in an OLE
      DB application, please see the following article in the Microsoft
      Knowledge Base:

      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../odbc/q166083.htm">Q166083</A></B>

7. Q. How do I enable connection pooling for Active Server Pages (ASP) or
      ActiveX Data Objects (ADO)?

   A. Microsoft Internet Information server (IIS) version 3.0 with Active
      Server Pages takes advantage of connection pooling. You can enable
      connection pooling for IIS users by changing the value of
      StartConnectionPool to 1. The StartConnectionPool is located under
      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\W3SVC\ASP
      \Parameters.

8. Q. How do I limit the number of connections in the pool?

   A. The number of connections in the pool is controlled by the ODBC
      driver manager. ODBC applications cannot control it.

9. Q. How do I monitor how many connections are in the pool?

   A. There is no way to monitor how many connections are in the pool.

10. Q. How do I clear out the connections in the pool?

   A. How long a connection remains in the pool depends on the CPTimeout
      property of the ODBC driver. When the timeout expires, the connection
      will be closed and removed from the pool. The ODBC application can
      use SQLConfigDriver to change the value of CPTimeout, and this value
      applies to all the ODBC applications that are using the specified
      ODBC driver. The default value for the CPTimeout is 60 seconds.

11. Q. Do I have to explicitly enable connection pooling if my application
      is running in Microsoft Transaction Server?

   A. If you are going through an ODBC driver to an ODBC data source,
      Microsoft Transaction Server will enable connection pooling; you do
      not have to explicitly enable connection pooling.

12. Q. What if a connection in the pool goes bad? Will the ODBC driver
      manager be able to detect it ?

   A. ODBC 3.0 hands over a bad connection without checking whether the
      connection is bad or not. With Service Pack 1, the driver manager
      will detect a bad connection. If a connection in the pool is bad, the
      driver manager will detect it and return a good connection. If the
      driver manager is not able to create a good connection, it will
      return an error message.

13. Q. With ODBC 3.0 Service Pack 1, will the ODBC driver manager try to
      connect to the database server repeatedly when the server is not
      available?

   A. ODBC 3.0 Service Pack 1 introduced a new API, ODBCSetTryWaitValue, to
      prevent the ODBC driver manager from connecting to an unavailable
      server repeatedly. ODBCSetTryWaitValue takes a DWORD parameter and
      saves the information in the registry at the following location:

      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Odbc\Odbcinst.ini
      \ODBC Connection Pooling\Retry Wait

      Once the diver manager detects a bad database server, it returns an
      error message and marks the connection with the time. From that point
      until the RetryWait value expires, the driver manager returns a
      failure without trying to reconnect to the database server.

      For more information about how to use the ODBCSetTryWaitValue ODBC
      API, see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
