<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The Access ODBC driver ignores the Pagetimeout parameter specified in
ODBC datasources.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem:
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them.
Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of
Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

<OL><P><LI>Run Registry Editor (REGEDT32.EXE).

<P><LI>   From the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following key:
<P>
<P><PRE>      \SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Jet\3.0\Engines
</PRE>
<P><LI>From the Edit menu, select Add Key and enter the following key: Jet

<P><LI>   Select the Jet key.

<P><LI>   From the Edit menu, select Add Value.

<P><LI>Add the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Value: PageTimeout
      Data Type: REG_DWORD
      Data: &lt;Decimal value in milliseconds&gt;
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: If this value is set too low, performance may degrade due to
   Jet increasing its reading of the mdb file. Do not set the value lower
   than the Jet 2.0 default of 0.5 second. The PageTimeout parameter is
   expressed in 100 millisecond units. So, a value of 5 stands for 500
   milliseconds or .5 seconds.
<P>

<P><LI>   Click OK.

<P><LI>   Quit Registry Editor.

<P><LI>Shut down and restart Windows NT.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the ODBC Access 3.40.2829
Driver. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Access ODBC driver is built on the Jet Database Engine. Jet buffers
the pages read from a mdb file. The interval at which Jet reads pages
from the mdb file to refresh the buffer is controlled by a Pagetimeout
parameter. Jet does not refresh its internal buffer from the mdb file
until the Pagetimeout interval has expired (even if you issue a Select
against the table whose data is in those pages). If you do Select Jet
provides the information from the buffer. It does not actually read pages
in from the mdb file until the Pagetimeout interval has expired.
<P>
If multiple instances of Jet (such as separate connections through the
Access driver or separate instances of Access) are working with the same
mdb file, updates made by one task is not visible to a second task until
after the second task's Pagetimeout interval has expired. For example, if
the second task s Pagetimeout interval is set to 20 seconds, the updates
made by the first task is not visible to the second task for 20 seconds.
<P>
In Jet 2.0, which is the version used in the ODBC Desktop Drivers version
2.0, the Jet Pagetimeout interval defaults to 0.5 second. In Jet 3.0, which
is the version used in the ODBC Desktop Drivers 3.0, the default has been
raised to 5 seconds. Therefore, users have noticed that updates, inserts,
and deletes made in one Jet task (either the ODBC Access driver or Access
itself) does not appear in another Jet task for 5 seconds.
<P>
The Pagetimeout interval can be specified in two places. The default for
all instances of Jet on a computer is stored in the following Windows NT
Registry subkey:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Jet\3.0\Engines\Jet

</PRE></OL>In addition, the Access ODBC driver supports a distinct Pagetimeout value
for each ODBC datasource. This can be specified in Advanced options when
you configure a data source manually in the ODBC Administrator. The value
specified in the datasource is ignored. The ODBC driver always uses the
Pagetimeout value from the registry location mentioned above. If the Jet
key does not exist or does not include a specified Pagetimeout value, the
driver always uses the Jet default of 5 seconds.
