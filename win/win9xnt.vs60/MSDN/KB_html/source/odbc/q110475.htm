<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When a Windows DLL is written such that it acts as an intermediary
between several applications and ODBC drivers, it may be necessary to
share connections among the applications. This article discusses the
architectural blocks to sharing ODBC environment, connection, and
statement handles among several applications through a user Windows
DLL. It also discusses how a service provider DLL can be written so
that it can access ODBC drivers and provide an interface to
applications without sharing handles between applications.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
ODBC Environment, connection, and statement handles are unique to tasks and
cannot be shared among different tasks because the ODBC Driver Manager and
ODBC drivers, when allocating memory for the connection, do not use the
DDE_SHARE option on the GlobalAlloc(). For instance, in response to a call
from an application, when a user DLL calls SQLAllocConnect() in the driver
DLL, the memory is being allocated by the driver DLL in the context of the
calling task, for example, the task that called the user DLL. In this
scenario, another task that calls this same user DLL cannot then use this
recently allocated connection handle to call ODBC functions.
<P>
If an ODBC connection needs to be shared among several applications, the
following equivalent approach may be used. Instead of writing a DLL that
shares various ODBC handles among applications, write an application that
provides the same services as the user DLL would. Such an application would
contain the calls to SQLAllocEnv(), SQLAllocConnect(), SQLAllocStmt(), and
various other ODBC calls, and the other applications that need ODBC access
can communicate via DDE with this DDE Server application. All ODBC function
calls would then be encapsulated in the DDE Server application.
<P>
When writing a user DLL (without sharing ODBC handles among applications),
it is important to have a separate ODBC environment for every
task/application. Therefore, each application must make its own calls to
SQLAllocEnv(), or have an initialization routine in the user DLL call
SQLAllocEnv() in the ODBC driver in the context of the calling
application/task.
