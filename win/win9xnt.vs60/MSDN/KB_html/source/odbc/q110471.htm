</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
As is typical in network installations of software, the ODBC setup program
cannot be used to install the ODBC components on a file server with just
the .INI files being installed on the client computers. The ODBC Setup
program, however, can be used by administrators to simplify the
installation of ODBC components on client computers.
<P>
This article explains how to use a setup option to make multi-client ODBC
installations simple. Note that all the ODBC components will be installed
on every client workstation.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Setup program that ships with ODBC drivers in Microsoft products,
such as Microsoft Access and Visual Basic, has an option called 'auto,'
which, given a valid ODBC installation on a client workstation, makes it
simple to duplicate the same ODBC setup on other client computers.
<P>
Follow the steps below to install the ODBC components on multiple client
computers:

<OL><P><LI>Install the ODBC drivers and add the required data sources on a client
   computer.

<P><LI>Create a directory on a network file server and copy all the files
   on the ODBC setup disk into this directory.

<P><LI>Copy the ODBC.INI and ODBCINST.INI files created by Setup in step 1 to
   this new directory.

<P><LI>Modify the SETUP.LST file on the file server so that the following two
   lines are added to the [Files] section:
<P>
<P><PRE>      odbc.ini = odbc.ini
      odbcinst.ini = odbcinst.ini
</PRE>
<P><LI>From the client computers, connect to this network share and run
   Setup with the Auto option from the share.
<P>
</OL>All the drivers and data source entries will be copied to the client s
workstation. Note that any data sources that exist on the client
workstation before running setup/auto will remain in the client s ODBC.INI
file. If the client workstation did not have any ODBC components or .INI
files, setup/auto will create the new .INI files and copy all the drivers
from the network drive to the client computer.
