BUG# ODBCDBASE: 1915 (1.01.1928)
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Under certain multi-user situations, applications using the Microsoft
ODBC Access driver versions 1.01.1928 and 1.01.2115 may encounter the
following two problems:

<OL><P><LI>Read locks are retained longer than necessary. As a result of this,
   when an application that executes a SELECT statement on a table such
   that the WHERE clause contains a column with a unique index on it, other
   applications will not be able to insert, delete, or update that table.
   Attempts to do so will cause the following error:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Commit Lock failed due to outstanding read lock
</PRE><P>
   Locks will not be released until the application that did the SELECT
   calls SQLDisconnect.

<P><LI>Applications may be unable to "see" updates (row insertions,
   deletions, and updates) made by other applications. This occurs under
   the following circumstances:
<P>
   Application A executes a SELECT statement on a table and fetches all
   the rows; then, application B updates (insert, delete or update) the
   same table. Now if A re-executes the same SELECT statement and fetches
   all the rows, it will see the exact same rows that it saw before; it
   does not see the updates made by B. For A to be able to see the
   updates, it needs to call SQLDisconnect on the hdbc on which the
   original SELECT was performed.
<P>
   The ODBC Access driver is based on a sub component of the Access
   database engine. This Access database engine implements a performance
   enhancing caching scheme, as rows are retrieved from the database or
   updated by an application they are cached. In most cases, this permits
   rows to be re-retrieved without having to re-read from the actual
   database file, thereby, enhancing performance.
<P>
   Locks held on the actual rows of the database from which they were
   retrieved are not released until the corresponding cached rows are
   flushed from the cache. Since locked rows are not updated due to reasons
   of integrity, it follows that updates are not initiated until the
   cache is flushed. The database engine caching scheme relies on the
   application that is using the engine to initiate the process of flushing
   the cache. This permits the application to "time" the flushing of the
   cache to correspond with the operations the application is performing at
   the time.
<P>
   For example, the Access product initiates the flushing process during
   user "think time" to maximize the responsiveness of the user
   interface. In the Access ODBC driver, the driver itself initiates the
   flushing process, since relying on the application to do this would
   reduce the interoperability of applications. If the driver relied on the
   application to initiate this process, it would require applications to
   write special code to use the Access ODBC driver. This is contrary to
   the goal of ODBC.
<P>
</OL>In Access ODBC driver versions 1.01.1928 and 1.01.2115, this flushing
process was initiated when SQLDisconnect was called by the application.
This proved to be inadequate for some multi-user scenarios and caused the
problems described above. A recent "hotfix" version of the driver
(version 1.02.1403) initiates the flushing process at the following
times:

<OL><P><LI>SQLFreeStmt with the SQL_DROP option

<P><LI>SQLFreeStmt with the SQL_CLOSE option

<P><LI>SQLDisconnect
<P>
</OL>This causes cached rows to be flushed more often. It also means that the
database file will be read more frequently, with the possibility of some
performance degradation. However, it solves the problem of locks being
held for longer than is necessary. It also solves the problem of
visibility of updates in many multi-user scenarios.
<P>
In a few scenarios, it is possible that locking conflicts will still be
encountered and updates will not be visible across applications, unless
it is dropped and re-establish the connection. In particular, an
application that executes a SELECT statement on a table such that the
WHERE clause contains a column with a unique index on it, will not be
able to see updates made to the table by other applications, until it
drops and re-establishes the connection.
<P>
For the hotfix to work properly, the following entries should be
inserted in the [Red ISAM] section of ODBCISAM.INI file:
<P>
IdleFrequency=1
PageTimeout=1
LockedPageTimeout=1
<P>
This minimizes the chance of encountering the "updates-not-visible"
problem. The ODBCISAM.INI file is usually located in the \WINDOWS
directory.
<P>
You will also note that the Access product does not, in general, exhibit
this same behavior. The reason is the mechanism used to flush cached
rows is somewhat different in the Access product which includes the
complete Access database engine, than in the Access ODBC driver which
uses a sub component of that engine. The complete Access database engine,
enables an application to detect when it has successfully flushed all
rows from the cache. Therefore, to ensure concurrency and the visibility
of updates, Access flushes the cache until all rows have been forced
out. The Access ODBC driver, using the sub component of the Access
engine, can flush rows from the cache, but is unable to tell when all
rows have been forced out. Therefore, it cannot guarantee that locking
conflicts and the visibility of updates is resolved for every scenario.
<P>
Version 2.0 of the ODBC Driver Pack will be based on the complete
Access database engine and will exhibit the same capability in this
area as the Access product. Driver Pack version 2.0 is currently
scheduled for release 2H 1994.
<P>
It should also be noted that even in the Access product, applications
written in Access BASIC, can encounter substantially the same lock
conflict scenario as outlined above. The way that locking conflicts are
dealt with in this case, for example in Access BASIC applications, is for
the application to retry the retrieval when such a conflict is encountered.
Applications written to the ODBC Access driver can employ the same strategy
to resolve such conflicts.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Access Driver versions
1.01.1928 and 1.01.2115. This problem has been fixed in Access driver
version 1.02.1403. For more information, please contact your primary
support provider.
