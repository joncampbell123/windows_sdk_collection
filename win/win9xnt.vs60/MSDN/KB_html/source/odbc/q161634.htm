<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes the relationships of connection pooling,
environments, and drivers.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Connection pooling is one the new features introduced in ODBC 3.0.
Connection pooling enables an ODBC application to reuse a connection from a
pool of connections. Once a connection has been created and placed in the
pool, an ODBC application can reuse the same driver and the connection
within the same environment (henv) without performing the complete
connection process. Connection can never be reused between different henv
or different drivers.
<P>
You can use the SQLSetEnvAttr function call to enable connection pooling.
There are two attributes available for connection pooling under the
SQLSetEnvAttr function: SQL_CP_ONE_PER_HENV and SQL_CP_ONE_PER_DRIVER. The
difference between these two attributes is a performance/comparison
consideration, and the use of any one of these options does not change
which connection is reused.
<P>
With the SQL_CP_ONE_PER_HENV attribute, a comparison pool is created for
each henv. The pool may include connections from different drivers within
the same environment. The ODBC driver manager searches this pool for the
driver that matches the requested connection. You normally use this option
if there are many henvs but few drivers, because it saves you the number of
comparisons (with the cost of memory for the pools).
<P>
With the SQL_CP_ONE_PER_DRIVER attribute, a comparison pool is created for
each driver. The pool may include different henvs that use the same driver.
The ODBC driver manager searches this pool for the henv that matches the
requested connection. You normally use this option if there are many
drivers but few henvs, for the same reason in the previous paragraph.
<P>
The ODBC 3.0 API online Help version 4.00.950 mistakenly states that you
can share connections between different environments with the
SQL_CP_ONE_PER_HENV attribute. Connections can only be reused within the
same henv and the same driver. Connections can never be reused between
different henvs or different drivers.
