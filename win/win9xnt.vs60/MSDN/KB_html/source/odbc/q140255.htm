      available from Visigenic, which is necessary for those customers with
      Excel 5.0x who encounter bugs in the 16-bit Oracle 7 driver (from the

      driver. Visigenic can be reached at (800)632-2864.]
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - Text
</PRE><P>
</UL>These ODBC drivers are 32-bit only and are designed for use by ODBC-
compliant, 32-bit programs running under Microsoft Windows 95 or Microsoft
Windows NT(R) 3.51. Note that the ORACLE 7.0 and 7.1 ODBC drivers are
designed only for Windows NT 3.51 and not Microsoft Windows 95.
<P>
<P><h3>Installation Requirements</h3>
 
<P>
To set up the ODBC drivers, you must have one of the following 32-bit
ODBC-compliant programs installed on your computer:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access for Windows 95

<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95

<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows 95

<LI>Microsoft Office for Windows 95

<LI>Microsoft Project for Windows 95

<LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro(TM) version 3.0

<LI>Microsoft Visual Basic(R) version 4.0

<LI>Microsoft Visual C++ version 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, or 4.0
<P>
</UL>To use the ORACLE 7.0 ODBC drivers, you must have a 32-bit version of
SQL*Net(R) installed on your computer. For information about obtaining
the 32-bit version of SQL*Net, please contact Oracle Corporation at
(800) 345-DBMS.
<P>
<P><h3>Installation</h3>
 
<P>
To install the Microsoft ODBC drivers, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>If you received the disks with this Application Note, run Windows
   Explorer in Windows 95 (or File Manager in Windows NT) and create a
   new folder on drive C called Ge1263.
<P>
   If you downloaded this Application Note from an online service,
   skip to step 5. This procedure assumes that you have already
   downloaded and extracted the compressed file to a folder on drive C
   named Ge1263.

<P><LI>Insert Disk 1 in drive A, copy the contents of Disk 1 to the Ge1263
   folder, and double-click Disk1.exe to extract the files it
   contains.

<P><LI>Insert Disk 2 in drive A, copy the contents of Disk 2 to the Ge1263
   folder, and double-click Disk2.exe to extract the files it
   contains.

<P><LI>If you are running Windows 95, click the Start button, and then
   click Run. (If you are running Windows NT, choose Run from the File
   menu in Program Manager or File Manager.)

<P><LI>In the Open box (or in the Command Line box in Windows NT), type
   the following command, and then click OK:
<P>
<P><PRE>      c:\ge1263\setup
</PRE>
<P><LI>Follow the setup instructions on the screen. Note that the Setup
   program also runs the ODBC Administrator (Odbcad32.exe), which
   enables you to set up data sources for the Microsoft ODBC drivers.
<P>
</OL><h3>Help Files for ODBC Drivers</h3>
 
<P>
This Application Note includes the following three driver-specific
help files:

<UL><LI>The ODBC SQL Server help file (Drvssrvr.hlp) contains information
   about adding, modifying, and connecting to Microsoft SQL Server
   data sources, connection string attributes, and ODBC conformance
   levels.

<LI>The ODBC Desktop Database Drivers Help file (Odbcjet.hlp)
   contains information about adding and modifying Microsoft Jet
   database engine data sources, connecting to and deleting data
   sources, and levels of ODBC conformance. The Odbcjet.hlp file
   contains a "Product Support" topic with details about ODBC
   support offerings from Microsoft. The Odbcjtnw.hlp file is a
   subset of the Odbcjet.hlp file and describes new features of the
   ODBC drivers.

<LI>The Visigenic ODBC ORACLE Driver Help file (Oracle.hlp) contains
   information about adding, modifying, and connecting to ORACLE
   version 7.0 data sources, connection string attributes, and
   levels of ODBC conformance.

include associated media, printed materials, and "online" or
electronic documentation ("SOFTWARE PRODUCT" or "SOFTWARE"). By
exercising your rights to make and use copies of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT,
you agree to be bound by the terms of this EULA. If you do not agree
to the terms of this EULA, you may not use the SOFTWARE PRODUCT.

The SOFTWARE PRODUCT is protected by copyright laws and international
copyright treaties, as well as other intellectual property laws and
treaties. The SOFTWARE PRODUCT is licensed, not sold.

<OL><P><LI>GRANT OF LICENSE. This EULA grants you the following rights:
<P>
<P><PRE>       Use with Microsoft Excel, Project, Word, FoxPro, Microsoft
</PRE>  Access, and/or Office for Windows (individually, "MS Application").
  If you license the SOFTWARE for use in conjunction with one or more
  MS Application(s), the terms and conditions of the end user license
  agreement you received with such MS Application(s) apply to the
  SOFTWARE, except that you have the additional right to make and use
  up to that number of copies of the SOFTWARE equal to the number of
  copies of such MS Application(s) that you have licensed. Note: you
  may make only one copy of the SOFTWARE for each unit of Microsoft
  Office for Windows that you have licensed.
<P>
<P><PRE>       Developing applications using the Visual Basic for
</PRE>  Applications component of MS Applications. In addition to
  the rights set forth in Section 1(a) above, Microsoft grants you
  the nonexclusive, royalty-free right to reproduce and distribute
  the object code version of the SOFTWARE, provided you comply with
  Section 5 herein.
<P>
<P><PRE>       Developing applications using Microsoft Access Developer's
</PRE>  Toolkit, Visual C++, Microsoft FoxPro, or Visual Basic
  (individually, "MS Development Tool").
<P>
<P><PRE>       (i) If you license the SOFTWARE for use in conjunction with an
</PRE>  MS Development Tool, you may make and use up to the number of
  copies of the SOFTWARE equal to the number of copies of MS
  Development Tools that you have licensed. Each copy of the SOFTWARE
  must be used on a single computer. The SOFTWARE is "in use" on a
  computer when it is loaded into temporary memory (i.e., RAM) or
  installed into permanent memory (e.g., hard disk, CD-ROM, or other
  storage device) of that computer. However, installation on a
  network server for the sole purpose of internal distribution to one
  or more other computer(s) shall not constitute "use" for which a
  separate license is required, provided you have a separate license
  for each computer to which the SOFTWARE is distributed. You may
  make an unlimited number of copies (either in hard copy or
  electronic form) of any electronic documents included with the
  SOFTWARE, provided that such copies shall be used for internal
  purposes and are not republished or distributed beyond the user's
  premises. In addition, Microsoft grants you the nonexclusive,
  royalty-free right to reproduce and distribute the object code
  version of the SOFTWARE provided you comply with Section 5 herein,
  and subject to Section 1(c)(ii) herein.
<P>
<P><PRE>       (ii) The following additional restrictions apply if you use
</PRE>  the SOFTWARE other than solely for internal business purposes. (For
  applicable licensing terms for all such uses of the SOFTWARE,
  please contact Microsoft Corporation at (425) 703-4515.) (1) You
  may commercially distribute the SOFTWARE only in conjunction with
  and as part of your software product to which you have added
  significant and primary functionality and value. (2) Unless your
  software product requires your customer to license Microsoft Office
  for Windows, or a component of it, in order to operate, you may not
  reproduce or use the SOFTWARE for commercial distribution in
  conjunction with a general purpose word processing, spreadsheet, or
  database software product, or an integrated work or product suite
  whose components include a general purpose word processing,
  spreadsheet, or database management software product except for the
  exclusive purpose of importing or exporting data to the various
  formats supported by the SOFTWARE and included in your application
  (e.g., reading data from and writing data to a single data source
  at one time). Note: a product which includes limited word
  processing, spreadsheet, or database components along with other
  components that provide significant and primary value, such as an
  accounting product with limited spreadsheet capability, is not
  considered to be a "general purpose" product.
<P>
