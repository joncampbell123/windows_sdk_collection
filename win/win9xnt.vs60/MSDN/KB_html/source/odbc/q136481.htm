The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Open Database Connectivity, version 2.5
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
ODBC applications running as Windows NT services may encounter the
following error when attempting to connect to an ODBC data source:
<P>
<PRE>   szSqlState = "IM002"
   pfNativeError = 0
   szErrorMsg = "[Microsoft][ODBC Driver Manager] Data source name
                 not found and no default driver specified"

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When a standard ODBC data source is defined, it is specific to the Windows
NT account under which the ODBC Administrator process is running. This is
because the data source definition is stored in the HKEY_CURRENT_USER hive
in the Windows NT registry. Applications running in environments which do
not have that specific user's hive set up as HKEY_CURRENT_USER will not
have access to that data source.
<P>
Applications running as Windows NT services can be made to run under a
Windows NT account using the control panel, but may be running at times
when that user's hive is not the one set up as HKEY_CURRENT_USER. For
example, if the NT account is not logged on, their hive will not be set as
HKEY_CURRENT_USER, and the NT service will not be able to access the ODBC
data source. This also applies to DLLs running as SQL Server version 6.0
Extended Stored Procedures because they run as part of the SQL Server
process, which always runs as a Windows NT service. This same problem also
affects applications running under the Windows NT Scheduler service, which
covers applications started with the Windows NT AT command.
<P>
Microsoft ODBC version 2.5 addresses this problem by introducing the
concept of a system data source. The definitions of system data sources are
stored in the registry HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE hive under SOFTWARE/ODBC/ODBC.INI
where they will always be accessible to Windows NT services.
<P>
ODBC 2.5 started shipping with Microsoft SQL Server version 6.0 and
Microosft Office 95, and will ship with future releases of other ODBC-
capable products.
<P>
Users who do not already have an ODBC 2.5 driver installed can obtain the
ODBC 2.5 ODBC Administrator and Driver Manager by downloading the file
ODBC25.EXE from the Microsoft Software Library (MSL).
