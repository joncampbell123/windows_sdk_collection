$10.25 to cover the cost of materials and shipping. To get this kit, call
the Microsoft Supplemental Parts Desk at (800) 360-7561.
<P>
What's new in this kit?
<P>
<PRE>   - Support for these additional data sources:
     Oracle 7, Microsoft Excel version 5, Access 2, FoxPro 2.6, Paradox
     4.x, and 32-bit support for SQL Server 4.2.
   - Compliant with ODBC version 2.01 specification.
   - Users can call stored queries in Access in the same manner they would
     use tables.
   - Users can attach to named ranges in a Microsoft Excel worksheet.
   - Support for scrollable cursors.
   - Transactions are supported against Access, SQL Server, and Oracle
     data.
   - Support for updateable joins.
   - Based on a 32-bit version of the Jet engine (version 2.5).
   - Improved performance.
   - Support for stored queries or stored procedures.
   - The desktop drivers support positioned cursor operations natively
    (via SQLSetPos)

</PRE>What are the changes in functionality between the version 1 drivers and
these?
<P>
<PRE>   In addition to the new features outlined above, please see the
   helpfile (ODBCJTNW.HLP) for a list of differences.

</PRE>My company has lots of workstations that need this software. Do I
need to purchase lots of copies of the fulfillment kit?
<P>
<PRE>   The license in the fulfillment kit allows you to install the drivers
   onto any workstation that has a valid license for Word, Microsoft Excel,
   Access, FoxPro, Visual Basic, Visual C or the single-user ODBC
   Desktop Driver Pack version 1.0. You need to purchase only one copy
   of the fulfillment kit to install it on any of these machines.

</PRE>I developed an application using Visual Basic for Applications in Microsoft
Excel and the pre-release Microsoft Access 2.0 driver. I understand that
this driver did not ship with the early releases of Microsoft Excel 5.0.
May I ship the driver with my Visual Basic for Applications application?
<P>
<PRE>   The early ODBC Driver for Microsoft Access shipped with only Microsoft
   Excel 5.0c. The license in this kit allows you to ship the Microsoft
   Access 2.0 ODBC driver with your Visual Basic for Applications
   application as long as the target workstation has a valid license for
   Word or Microsoft Excel.

</PRE>Can I use the new Microsoft Access 2.0 driver with 1.0 or 1.1 data?
<P>
<PRE>   Yes. This new driver supports all versions of Microsoft Access data.

</PRE>Is this the same version of Jet that ships with Microsoft Access 2.0?
<P>
<PRE>   No. This product includes version 2.5 of Microsoft's Jet database
   engine. However, this engine will work seamlessly with Microsoft
   Access 2.0 and Visual Basic 3.0 using the Visual Basic Compatibility
   Layer.

</PRE>Can I use the 16-bit drivers from 32-bit applications?
<P>
<PRE>   Under Windows for Workgroups, 32-bit Win32s-based applications can use
   16-bit drivers. Under Windows NT, 16-bit applications can use 16- or
   32-bit drivers and 32-bit applications can only use 32-bit drivers.

</PRE>What version of Windows NT do I need to run the desktop drivers?
<P>
<PRE>   You must use Windows/NT version 3.5 for the desktop drivers. The
   SQL Server and Oracle drivers can run on Windows NT 3.1 or 3.5.

</PRE>Can I use the desktop drivers with Windows 95?
<P>
<PRE>   Since Windows 95 is not a released operating system, the drivers are
   not guaranteed to work with it. Future versions of the drivers will
   be Windows 95-compliant.

      NOTE: For updated information on drivers since the release of Windows
            95, please see Knowledge Base article <B><A href="../odbc/q139487.htm">Q139487</A></B>, "WX1220: ODBC
            Drivers Appnote" in the CROSSPRD database.

</PRE>Does the Oracle 7 driver work with Oracle 6?
<P>
<PRE>   The Oracle 7 driver only works with Oracle 7.

</PRE>Does the Oracle 6 driver work with Oracle 7?
<P>
<PRE>   Yes, but you cannot take advantage of the new features in Oracle 7.

</PRE>What's the conformance levels for these drivers?
<P>
<PRE>   API = Level 1 with lots of level 2 implemented.
   SQL = Minimum.

</PRE>Does the ODBC Driver Pack support "SQL extended fetch"?
<P>
<PRE>   The desktop drivers support the level 2 ODBC API call
   SQLExtendedFetch. The other drivers support SQLExtendedFetch
   through use of the cursor library.

</PRE>What languages will the drivers be available in?
<P>
<PRE>   - German
   - French
   - Italian
   - Swedish
   - Dutch
   - Spanish
   - Danish
   - Norwegian
   - Portuguese
   - Finnish

</PRE>NOTE WITH REFERENCE TO ODBC AND THE MACINTOSH PLATFORM: The ODBC 2.0
Fulfillment Kit will only run on a Windows platform, not the Macintosh. All
drivers that work with Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh are included with
Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh. To obtain additional ODBC drivers, you
should check with the third party manufacturers.
