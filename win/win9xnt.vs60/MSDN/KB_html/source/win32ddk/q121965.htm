<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When using MmProbeAndLockPages, you need to remember that there is a limit
to the amount of memory that can be locked down by MmProbeAndLockPages. The
amount of memory is normally determined by the computer system at boot
time. However, if you need to probe and lock more memory than is being
allowed, there is a registry parameter that you can configure to allow you
to determine the amount of memory available to probe and lock.
<P>
A key named IoPageLockLimit is located in
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Memory
Management. By default, this limit is 0, which indicates to the system that
it should use a built-in algorithm to determine the amount of memory. You
can change this value to indicate the number of bytes that can be used for
MmProbeAndLockPages.
<P>
NOTE: Be careful when changing this value. The default value computed by
the system when IoPageLockLimit is 0 is tuned specifically for system
performance. Allowing the system to lock down more memory can have a
detrimental effect on system performance.
