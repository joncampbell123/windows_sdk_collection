<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This articles discusses three caveats to keep in mind if you create custom
IOCTL code for use with a driver so that the driver accesses memory
allocated by an application.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
First, in order for this operation to succeed, the driver may only get
access to the memory if it is a highest level driver whose
DispatchDeviceControl routine is run in the context of the thread
manufactured to request this operation. A driver's StartIo, DPC, ISR, or
APC routine cannot be guaranteed of this as these routines are run in an
arbitrary thread context.
<P>
Second, any access to this buffer must be wrapped in an appropriate
exception handler. The buffer must be probed by calling
MmProbeAndLockPages. Be careful when performing operations on this buffer.
Access could also be obtained by wrapping access to the buffer in an
appropriate exception handler, locking the pages, and then mapping the
locked pages. With this alternative method, caution must still be used when
performing operations on the buffer. Problems can occur when the
application that owns this buffer changes the access mode for the memory or
attempts to deallocate the memory while the driver attempts to read or
write to it.
<P>
Third, caution must be exercised as there is no way to synchronize access
to this memory between the driver and the application. Applications should
NEVER attempt to share memory by using a DeviceIoControl call. As well, an
application should NEVER attempt to read or write to the buffer
simultaneous with a driver.
<P>
In conclusion, while it is possible to share memory between an application
and a driver, the aforementioned precautions must be observed. Setting up
sharing of memory should be done using a DeviceIoControl (for example, by
mapping a region of memory into the applications address space), and
alternatives should be exercised if feasible.
