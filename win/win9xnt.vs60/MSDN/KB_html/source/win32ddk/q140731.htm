<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Windows 95 DDK contains a generic Plug and Play VxD sample for
developers who want to support a device that does not fit into any of
Windows 95's predefined device classes (COMM, SCSI, MOUSE, and so on). The
sample does not, however, document how to load this generic Plug and Play
VxD driver. This article explains how to load it.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Windows 95 supports the dynamic arrival and removal of devices (PCMCIA
cards, and so on). Therefore it also supports the dynamic loading and
unloading of drivers for these devices. Initial Installation of these
drivers is accomplished by using a Device Information File (.inf), as
documented in Pnp.doc in the Windows 95 DDK. One of the registry entries
defined in an .inf file is the DevLoader for the device.
<P>
A DevLoader is a VxD that is responsible for loading a driver that fits
into a specific Windows 95 device class. For example, VCOMM acts as the
DevLoader for VCOMM port drivers, IOS is the DevLoader for IOS port drivers
and SCSI miniports, and VMOUSE is the DevLoader for mouse mini-drivers. In
most cases, however, developers have no reason to develop a DevLoader just
to load their generic Plug and Play VxD. In this case, a developer can
specify that Configuration Manager act as the DevLoader for the device.
This can be accomplished by adding the following two entries to the AddReg
section of the device's .inf file (where Mydevice.vxd is the name of the
VxD to be loaded):
<P>
<PRE>    HKR,,DevLoader,,*CONFIGMG
    HKR,,DeviceDriver,,MYDEVICE.VXD

</PRE>Once Configuration Manager loads the VxD, it will send a PNP_NEW_DEVNODE
message to the VxD's control procedure with EBX containing the handle to
the device's devnode. The VxD can then register with Configuration Manager
using CONFIGMG_Register_Device_Driver to receive CONFIG_xxx notifications.
