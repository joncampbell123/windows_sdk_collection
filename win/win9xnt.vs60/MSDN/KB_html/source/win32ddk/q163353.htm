<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you write an Inf for a joystick device you commonly have an AddReg
section such as:
<P>
<PRE>    [Demo.AddReg]
    HKLM,%KEY_OEM%\Demo,OEMCallout,0,demo.vxd
    HKLM,%KEY_OEM%\demo,OEMData,1,20,0,0,0,8,0,0,0
    HKLM,%KEY_OEM%\demo,OEMName,0,%demo.DeviceDesc%

</PRE>OEMDATA is binary data that is detailed below.
<P>
There are two DWORDs, the first contains a set of flags, the second is the
number of buttons the device has. The flags specify what kind of device it
is, and which axes are present and how they should be interpreted. They are
all defined in mmddk.h, except the two new flags added in DirectX 3 which
are defined in dinput.h. The following flags are only used to remap the
axes of an OEM defined analog joystick that is polled directly by VJoyD.
They change the default behavior of VJoyD during analog polling but have no
effect on the data returned by mini-drivers.
<P>
<PRE>JOY_HWS_XISJ1Y    X is on the J1 Y axis
JOY_HWS_XISJ2X    X is on the J2 X axis
JOY_HWS_XISJ2Y    X is on the J2 Y axis
JOY_HWS_YISJ1X    Y is on the J1 X axis
JOY_HWS_YISJ2X    Y is on the J2 X axis
JOY_HWS_YISJ2Y    Y is on the J2 Y axis
JOY_HWS_RISJ1X    R is on the J1 X axis
JOY_HWS_RISJ1Y    R is on the J1 Y axis
JOY_HWS_RISJ2Y    R is on the J2 Y axis
JOY_HWS_ZISJ1X    Z is on the J1 X axis
JOY_HWS_ZISJ1Y    Z is on the J1 Y axis
JOY_HWS_ZISJ2X    Z is on the J2 X axis
</PRE>JOY_HWS_POVISJ1X  Polled POV is on the J1 X axis
JOY_HWS_POVISJ1Y  Polled POV is on the J1 Y axis
JOY_HWS_POVISJ2X  Polled POV is on the J2 X axis
<P>
The default behavior is:
<P>
X defaults to the J1 X axis.
Y defaults to the J1 Y axis.
R (rudder) defaults to the J2 X axis.
Z defaults to the J2 Y axis.
POV hat (if implemented as polling) defaults to the J2 Y axis.
<P>
Flags are also defined to determine whether POV data comes from an axis or
from a button combination. If the described device is being polled by
VJoyD, JOY_HWS_POVISBUTTONCOMBOS causes VJoyD to interpret button
combinations to produce the POV, otherwise an axis is used to find it. If
the described device is polled through a mini-driver, then a value in dwPOV
other than POV_UNDEFINED causes an override of any other POV calculation.
If JOY_HWS_POVISBUTTONCOMBOS is set, VJoyD interprets the buttons as it
would for an analog joystick. If JOY_HWS_POVISBUTTONCOMBOS is not set then
the POV is taken from the Z axis value if JOY_HWS_HASZ is not set, from R
otherwise. Mini-drivers should avoid having the generic VJoyD interpret POV
information when possible because a mini-driver usually knows more about
the hardware implementation.
