<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how to create a PCI Device driver for Windows NT. A
device driver must perform many functions, such as creating a device
object, etc. In addition, there are many more functions that a driver must
perform during driver initialization to support a PCI device. Note that
some of the functions mentioned below are also used in non-PCI drivers.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Following are the steps necessary to accomplish this task:

<OL><P><LI>Find the PCI device with HalGetBusData:
<P>
   Scan all the buses and slots to find the location of your PCI device. In
   the buffer returned by HalGetBusData, look for a match to your device's
   PCI VendorId and DeviceId.
<P>
   If your device driver requires additional information from the PCI
   configuration space, use HalGetBusData or HalGetBusDataByOffset. Fields
   in the PCI configuration space can be set with HalSetBusData or
   HalSetBusDataByOffset.
<P>
   IMPORTANT: Do not set the base address registers (BARs) or the interrupt
   information in the PCI configuration space. Also, do not expect the BARs
   original settings to be those that will be used for your device. Since
   PCI is dynamically configurable, the operating system reserves the right
   to move the BARs as it sees fit.
<P>
   Find the PCI device with 3 FOR loops: one for the bus, one for the
   device number, and one for the function number. Note that the structure
   PCI_SLOT_NUMBER contains the device number and function number
   information.

<P><LI>Claim the device resources with HalAssignSlotResources:
<P>
   Once the PCI device is located, pass the bus and slot information to
   HalAssignSlotResources. This API will ensure that there are no conflicts
   with the resources specified in the configuration space. Note that the
   HAL may move your memory or port ranges, so don't use the values
   directly from the configuration space. Instead, use the values returned
   in the resource list and translate them as indicated below.

<P><LI>Parse the resource list for the device resources:
<P>
   HalAssignSlotResources will claim the PCI device resources and return
   the claimed resources in a CM_RESOURCE_LIST structure. The driver will
   have to parse this resource list to get the interrupt, memory range, and
   I/O range information. Note that a single PCI device can have multiple
   memory and I/O ranges. If necessary, save this information in the
   driver's device extension for later translation. Do not use the raw
   resource information to access the I/O or memory spaces.
<P>
   At this point, if the driver were to examine the PCI configuration
   space, the BARs should be the same as those returned in the
   CM_RESOURCE_LIST structure. However, use the information returned in the
   resource list.

<P><LI>For each memory range claimed, call HalTranslateBusAddress and
   MmMapIoSpace:
<P>
   HalTranslateBusAddress translates a bus-specific address into the
   corresponding system-logical address. After the call to this API, check
   the fourth parameter. On entry to the API, zero indicates memory space.
   On exit from the API, if the value is still zero, as is the normal case
   for memory translation, the driver must also call MmMapIoSpace.
<P>
   Save the translated memory range information in a driver-accessible area
   like the device extension. Use the translated range to access the memory
   space.

<P><LI>For each I/O range claimed, call HalTranslateBusAddress, and if needed,
   MmMapIoSpace:
<P>
   Mapping is similar to that for memory space. However, on entry to
   HalTranslateBusAddress, the fourth parameter is one, which indicates I/O
   space. On exit, the API may have changed this parameter to zero, in
   which case the driver must also call MmMapIoSpace.
<P>
   Save the translated I/O range information in a driver-accessible area
   like the device extension. Use the translated range to access the I/O
   space.
<P>
   On some RISC-based systems, there is no I/O space: I/O space is mapped
   to memory space. In this situation, the fourth parameter will change to
   indicate that the I/O space has been mapped to memory space. On an x86-
   based system, translating an I/O space will use HalTranslateBusAddress,
   but not MmMapIoSpace. On some RISC-based systems, both
   HalTranslateBusAddress and MmMapIoSpace might be called. It is important
   to check the fourth parameter of HalTranslateBusAddress after the call
   to this API.
<P>
   This is a common problem when porting from x86-based machines to RISC
   platforms. Driver writers sometimes assume that if they are translating
   I/O ranges, they will never need to call MmMapIoSpace. This is an
   incorrect assumption.

<P><LI>If the device supports interrupts, call HalGetInterruptVector and
   IoConnectInterrupt:
<P>
   Once IoConnectInterrupt has been called, the driver's interrupt service
   routine (ISR) might be called if the PCI device is interrupting. For
   this reason, it is best to connect the interrupt after translating all
   the device registers. If the previous translation has not occurred or
   the information is not available to the ISR (if, for example, the
   translated memory and I/O ranges are not saved in the device extension),
   the ISR will not be able to check the PCI device registers and clear the
   interrupt. If the interrupt is not cleared, the system will hang.
