<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article is written mainly in the context of Windows NT printer
drivers, but applies to all Windows NT user-mode drivers, as the debugging
process is exactly the same.
<P>
It describes the prerequisites and steps to do source-level debugging of
Windows NT user-mode drivers using the WinDbg debugger and the WinDbgRm
remote debugger utilities, which are included with the Microsoft Win32
Software Development Kit (SDK). This information is to be used in addition
to WinDbg's online help, the "Programmer's Guide" from the Microsoft Win32
DDK, and the "Tools User's Guide" from the Microsoft Win32 SDK.
<P>
The Windows NT DDK includes sample source code for an assortment of Windows
NT printer drivers, display drivers, multimedia drivers, and the Build
utility.
<P>
The Microsoft Visual C++ compiler (version 2.0 or greater) is required to
build Windows NT drivers.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Requirements for Remote Debugging</h3>
 
<P>
Two computers are required to perform debugging of user-mode drivers. This
is because WinDbg must attach to, and occasionally halt, the Client-server
run-time server subsystem (CSRSS.EXE) that owns Win32 user-mode drivers.
CSRSS.EXE also handles local procedure calls (LPCs), and when halted it
cannot handle LPCs or input, which effectively freezes the machine being
debugged. However, the target computer running WinDbgRm can communicate to
the Host (running WinDbg) via network or null-modem serial communications
to resume operation.
<P>
You may use either the Free or Checked build of Windows NT on the target
computer, where the free build gives much faster response, and the checked
build helps to locate those really nasty bugs. You should use the Free
build of Windows NT on the host computer.
<P>
<P><h3>Configuring the Target for Remote Debugging</h3>
 
<P>
To allow WinDbg (on the host) to attach and debug via CSRSS.EXE on the
target computer, you must run REGEDT32.EXE and modify the following flag in
the registry of the target computer:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SessionManager

</PRE>Double-click the GlobalFlag, and change it as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   NT 3.5  -- from 0x211a0000 to 0x21120000  (clear bit 0x80000)
   NT 3.51 -- from 0x00000000 to 0x00030000

</PRE>This flag enables the ability to debug the affected computer's CSRSS.EXE
file. Do not modify this flag on the host to prevent accidentally attaching
WinDbg to the host's CSRSS.EXE file, which will cause the host computer to
hang. You must shut down and reboot the target computer for this setting to
take effect.
<P>
Use Print Manager in Control Panel to configure the target computer for the
printer you will be using. Be sure to connect the printer to a local (not a
network) port or FILE:, so that your printer driver will be used during
later debugging.
<P>
Before initiating remote debugging, save any open files and exit any
nonessential applications.
<P>
<P><h3>Debugger Configuration</h3>
 
<P>
Perform the following steps in the order listed to verify that both
computers are configured properly for remote debugging:
<P>
On the Target:

<OL><P><LI>Start WinDbgRm on the target computer.

<P><LI>On the Options menu, choose Transport DLL. Select the appropriate
   transport layer in the Known Transport Layers window. Select the
   Default Transport Layer check box to retain this setting for future
   sessions.
<P>
</OL>On the Host:

<OL><P><LI>Start WinDbg on the host computer.

<P><LI>On the Options menu, choose Debugger DLLs, and configure the matching
   communications settings in the Transport Layer list.
<P>
   NOTE: If you use TLPIPES you do not need the "\\" prefix for the host or
   target computer name.

<P><LI>On the Options menu, choose User DLLs. To inform WinDbg where the .DBG
   symbol files can be found for host system components, specify the path
   in the Symbol Search Path field of the User DLLs dialog box.

<P><LI>On the Program menu, choose Save As to save a workspace that will
   include your communications configuration so that you can retrieve it
   later by choosing Open from the Program menu.

<P><LI>On the Window menu, choose Command to pop up a Command window.

<P><LI>At the Command window prompt, enter ".attach -1" to attach to the
   CSRSS.EXE process on the target. If connecting to the target computer is
   successful, "Module load: CSRSS.DBG (symbols loaded)" will be displayed
   on the host computer's WinDbg Command window.
<P>
   As an alternative, on the Run menu, choose Attach. Select "-1 csrss.exe"
   in the Process Selection Dialog box that appears. Then click the Select
   button. When the WinDbg Process Attach message box appears, click Yes.

<P><LI>After the system DLLs are loaded, the WinDbg Command window on the host
   reports "Process attached -- stopped" and provides a prompt. Be sure
   that the above connection and other steps work before proceeding.
<P>
   NOTE: WinDbg and WinDbgRm cannot detach from an attached process, and
   therefore there is no convenient way to end a debugging session. No
   matter what you do to end the session, you will probably cause the
   target computer to hang and have to turn off the computer. On the host,
   you may be able to close WinDbg; if not, you should be able to terminate
   WinDbg by choosing End Task from the Windows NT's Task List. (Press
   CTRL+ESC or double-click in unused screen space to bring up the Task
   List.) Ordinarily, you should not have to reboot the host. WinDbg for
   future versions of Windows NT should be able to detach from attached
   processes.
<P>
   Further information on the configuration of the two computers can be
   found in WinDbg's Help menu, the "Programmer's Guide," and the "Tools
   User's Guide."
<P>
</OL><h3>Loading a Checked Driver</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Follow the "Programmer's Guide" for building a checked version of your
   driver.

<P><LI>On both the host and target, change to the directory containing the
   existing driver such as \%SystemRoot%\SYSTEM32\SPOOL\DRIVERS\W32X86\1
   for the x86 PostScript driver PSCRIPT.DLL.

<P><LI>Save the original driver.

<P><LI>Copy the newly built checked driver from %DDK%\lib\*\checked into the
   appropriate directory on both the target and host. The copy on the
   target will be run during debugging; the copy on the host will be used
   by WinDbg for getting debugging information. (A future version of WinDbg
   may allow communicating symbolic information from the target to the
   host.) More sophisticated methods of installing the driver are possible,
   but are not covered in this article.
<P>
   NOTE: If you have not printed since booting up, you can move, delete, or
   rename the printer driver; otherwise, you can use "net stop spooler"
   from the command line to unload the spooler and your driver. Then remove
   the original printer driver. Use "net start spooler" to reload the
   spooler and your new driver.
<P>
   NOTE: When testing and replacing your printer driver via the "net
   stop/start" commands, if your driver fails to unload properly this
   command may not work. This is because there may still be a handle to
   your (now corrupt) driver in memory, which can be seen with the PVIEW
   utility (included with the Win32 SDK) for the CSRSS.EXE process on the
   target. You should then shut down and reboot the machine.
<P>
</OL><h3>Debugging</h3>
 
<P>
Keep in mind that you will be running a checked driver and a test
application on the target computer running WinDbgRm. The host computer,
running WinDbg, is for debugging purposes.

<OL><P><LI>Attach the host to the target as noted above if not already connected.

<P><LI>On the host, choose Debug from the Options menu, and fill in your Source
   Search Paths in the Debugger Options dialog box to inform WinDbg where
   the source code is located.
<P>
   NOTE: the source code should not be located on the target machine.

<P><LI>On the host, choose Open from the File menu to open your source code in
   a window. Scroll to the desired line(s) in your code and choose
   Breakpoints from the Debug menu, or select the Breakpoint icon (stop
   hand) on the toolbar. The line will then be selected.
<P>
   NOTE: breakpoints can be set or cleared only when the target is halted.
   If the target is running, click the Halt (square) icon on the toolbar.
   If the target is not running, the Halt icon will be disabled.
<P>
   NOTE: There is currently no way to step into the DrvEnableDriver
   function for user-mode drivers such as display drivers and some
   multimedia drivers that are started at boot-time. This is because the
   driver is already loaded in the system before you can run WinDbgRm. You
   cannot break into this function using kernel-mode debugging either. The
   current method is to use debug print statements in this function while
   starting up the target in kernel-debugger mode. See the "Programmer's
   Guide" for enabling kernel debugging on the target.

<P><LI>Save your workspace as noted above.

<P><LI>Enter "g" in WinDbg's Command window on the host, or click the Go icon
   (arrow) on the toolbar to continue.

<P><LI>On the target, run a test application such as Notepad and print. This
   assumes the correct printer driver is already installed, selected, and
   connected to a local port or to FILE:. Before printing starts, WinDbg's
   Command window on the host should show that the driver and its symbols
   are loaded.
<P>
   NOTE: if you get an Unresolved Breakpoint dialog box in WinDbg on the
   host, choose the Quiet Defer button.

<P><LI>WinDbg on the host may break several times for exceptions; to continue,
   enter "gn" in the Command window to ignore the (typically harmless)
   exceptions.
<P>
   To automate this, choose Exceptions from the Options menu. Add the
   exception number and name in the appropriate fields. Choose Enable from
   the Action list. Enter "gn" in the First and Second Chance Command
   entries. Windows NT exceptions are defined in %DDK%\src\inc\ntstatus.h.
<P>
   NOTE: An exception commonly found in the sample PostScript printer
   driver is 0xC0000037, STATUS_PORT_DISCONNECTED. This is because the
   PostScript sample uses kernel-mode debug print statements. When you are
   debugging in user-mode, the kernel-mode print statements (to the debug
   port) cause this (harmless) exception. However, if the checked build
   PostScript driver is run without the debugger attached, the test
   application will generate the exception and terminate. The kernel-mode
   debug print statements are stripped out in a free build.
<P>
   The choice of kernel-mode debug print statements in combination with (or
   instead of) user-mode debug print statements is clearly a personal
   choice, as long as you understand their use. Debug print statements are
   detailed in the "Programmer's Guide."

<P><LI>When a breakpoint is hit, source level debugging of your user-mode
   driver proceeds in a manner similar to that used in local source code
   debugging of applications or DLLs, but interacts with the debuggee on
   the target instead of on the host.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: if you missed the breakpoint, check to ensure that your Source Search
Paths and your Symbol Search Paths are correct, and that your symbols match
on the target and host.
