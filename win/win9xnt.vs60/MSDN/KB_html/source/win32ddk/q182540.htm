The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 on the following platform:
<P>
   - x86
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Under very specific circumstances, Windows NT might fail to assign a system-
relative Interrupt Request Level (IRQL) to a Peripheral Component
Interconnect (PCI) device.
<P>
A driver first calls HalAssignSlotResources to retrieve the bus-relative
IRQL for the PCI device. When the driver calls HalGetInterruptVector to map
the bus-relative IRQL, the call might fail.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem is caused when a multiprocessor hardware-abstraction layer
(HAL) is used on a specific PCI configuration. For any non-zero bus, if a
PCI device is at Device #0 and it is the only PCI device on that bus, the
interrupt assignment fails. If there is more than one PCI device on the
bus, this problem does not occur.
<P>
This problem has occurred on systems with PCI Accelerated Graphics Port
(AGP) video devices because they are typically the only devices on the bus
and they are not on bus zero. Also, systems with multiple PCI buses might
have this problem.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0.
<P>
Hardware developers writing device drivers under multiple PCI bus systems
might experience this problem. If your PCI device drivers are configured as
described above and you experience this failure when calling
HalGetInterruptVector, contact Microsoft Technical Support to obtain a
hotfix.
<P>
A supported hotfix is now available, but has not been fully regression
tested and should be applied only to systems that have this specific
problem. Unless you are severely affected by this problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix.
Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
