<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Joyflt.exe is a driver that is actually two filter drivers in one. The
first driver is set on top of the joystick driver and examines the data
returned by the joystick driver. The second filter is set on top of the
keyboard class driver. It adds raw keystrokes to the keyboard buffer.
<P>
If the joystick filter detects that a button has been pressed, the keyboard
filter driver adds the appropriate raw keystroke to the keyboard buffer.
For example, pressing button two on the joystick causes the letter "g" to
be put in the keyboard buffer. In a flight simulation, the letter "g" is
often used to raise and lower the landing gear. Now a user does not have to
remove his or her hand from the joystick to press the letter "g." Instead,
you can accomplish this by pressing button two on the joystick. The
joystick filter detects this and the keyboard filter pushes the "g" onto
the keyboard buffer.
