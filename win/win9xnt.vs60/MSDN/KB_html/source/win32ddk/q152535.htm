<UL><LI>Microsoft Win32 Device Driver Kit (DDK) for Windows 95, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
A number of revisions of the Windows 95 Device Driver Kit (DDK) have
included Compatibility Tests (CTs) for various device classes. Past DDKs
included CTs for audio, block, display, modem, network, printer, plug and
play, systems, tape, and other devices.
<P>
The Windows 95 DDK CTs are outdated and should not be used. The Microsoft
Windows Hardware Quality Labs (WHQL) maintains current CTs that should be
used instead. You can find the location of current WHQL testing material by
sending e-mail to whqlinfo@microsoft.com. You will receive an autoreply
message listing Internet ftp and worldwide web (WWW) sites where you can
download current test tools and procedures.
<P>
CTs on international Windows 95 DDKs, such as the Japanese Windows 95 DDK,
are also outdated and should not be used. WHQL uses the current CTs on
their ftp and WWW sites for testing hardware submissions worldwide.
Localization of CTs is done primarily for ease of use. The functionality of
localized CTs does not change except for DBCS devices, such as printers,
that require Japanese Windows. In the case of DBCS devices, WHQL uses a
Japanese version of the printer test tool that adds DBCS functionality
testing.
