The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Internet Explorer (Programming), versions 4.0, 4.01
<LI>Internet Client SDK, versions 4.0, 4.01
</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Using the Internet Client SDK, an application can take advantage of the
features of Internet Explorer 4.0 by hosting either the WebBrowser control
or MSHTML. Both of these provide many features. However, the WebBrowser
control offers a lot more functionality and is more appropriate for the
vast majority of applications, where browsing or rich content viewing are
the primary objectives. The purpose of this article is to show the
advantages of hosting the WebBrowser control as opposed to hosting MSHTML.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
There is currently only one scenario where it is recommended that an
application host Mshtml.dll rather than the WebBrowser control: Parsing
HTML. The WalkAll sample in the Internet Client SDK demonstrates how to
host MSHTML. The WalkAll sample also shows how to host MSHTML without the
UI.
<P>
By hosting the WebBrowser control rather than MSHTML, you get the following
functionality for free:

<UL><LI>Inplace Hyperlinking. If you click a hyperlink, you navigate to the new
   document inplace rather than launch a new instance of Internet Explorer.

<LI>The ability to control viewing of rated sites.

<LI>Full support for security zoning.

<LI>Navigation. Simple Navigation methods rather than IPersist* interfaces
   for loading a Web document.

<LI>Full support of the window object from Dynamic HTML scripting.
<P>
</UL>For more information on hosting the WebBrowser control or reusing MSHTML,
please refer to Internet Client SDK Help. The topic "Reusing the WebBrowser
Control and MSHTML" discusses in detail how to host the WebBrowser Control
and MSHTML.
