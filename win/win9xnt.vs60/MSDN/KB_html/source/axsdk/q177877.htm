   TITLE     : How to Obtain Microsoft Support Files from Online Services

</PRE><h3>Prerequisites of this Release of the SDK</h3>
 
<P>
Before you can download the Internet Client SDK 4.01 refresh, you must have
the following installed on your computer:

<UL><LI>Internet Explorer 4.01.

<LI>Internet Client SDK 4.0 installed.

<LI>If you are developing software, the latest Win32 development files. You
   might already have installed these from the latest Platform SDK at
   <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/msdn/sdk/">http://www.microsoft.com/msdn/sdk/.</A></B> Otherwise, the subset you need is
   available as a download from the Internet Client SDK download page under
   "Win32 SDK Libraries &amp; Headers."

<LI>Windows 95 or Windows NT 4.0 SUR (final version).

<LI>Development tools, if you are building software. This product has been
   tested primarily on Visual C++ 5.0. (See "Configuration Issues" below
   for more information.)

<LI>Web authors and ISVs, please be sure to read the IE401Readme.txt file
   after installing this SDK refresh. It has the latest-breaking
   information and last-minute problems.
<P>
</UL><h3>Installation Issues - Internet Installs</h3>
 

<UL><LI>Download the Internet Client SDK for Internet Explorer 4.01. When
   prompted, run the executable from the Internet site or save the
   file to an alternative location to be run later.

<LI>The self-extracting file will prompt you for the location of the
   Internet Client SDK 4.0 directory. Verify that the directory is correct
   and then click the "UnZip" button.

<LI>To use the Alpha Headers &amp; Libraries, you need to download and install
   the Internet Client SDK 4.01 refresh using an Intel machine. Then copy
   the Headers &amp; Libraries to the Alpha platform.

<LI>If, in the future, you return to the Internet Client SDK download site
   and add (download) either the components "ActiveX Component Technology"
   or "Other Web Technology," you will need to refresh the Headers &amp;
   Libraries files for IE 4.01 by re-running the IESDK401.exe self-
   extracting zip file.

<LI>Note that the documentation in the Internet Client SDK 4.0 has not been
   updated in this download. To view the most recent documentation, please
   see the Internet Client SDK on SiteBuilder at:
