<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
There are some limitations to the WinInet FTP functions that developers
should be aware of. Before deciding to rely on WinInet for an application’s
FTP functionality, a developer should verify that the APIs function as
desired with all required FTP servers.
<P>
First, WinInet does not implement all of the functionality available
through the FTP protocol. While an interactive FTP client gives the user
the ability to do just about anything that a server supports, WinInet is
limited to the available API functions; there is no way to send a specific
FTP command through WinInet.
<P>
In addition, WinInet may not work with every FTP server. The FTP protocol
is designed with the presumption that the output is viewed by a human user,
who can interpret the reply code and text. WinInet FTP attempts to parse
and interpret the reply; if a server returns a nonstandard reply to the
WinInet client, WinInet may not be able to function properly. In addition,
the lack of the ability to send a particular FTP command may cause problems
with some servers.
<P>
There are Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) that wrap the base WinInet
functions. If any of the above problems are encountered in a non-MFC
application, it is extremely likely that the problem will be inherited by
the MFC WinInet classes; these classes don’t provide a workaround to a
problem inherent in the base API function. Conversely, if a problem is
experienced using the MFC WinInet classes, in some instances it may be
useful to try the base API calls for a possible workaround.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Below is a list of instances where problems are known to occur. This list
is not exhaustive, and developers may encounter additional limitations not
listed here.
<P>
VMS FTP servers: WinInet FTP functions may not work with some FTP servers
running on the VMS operating system. In particular, the FTP functions may
fail with an error, or the data structure that returns file information may
be blank or contain invalid data.
<P>

Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : PRB: FTP WinInet APIs Report Error 12003

</PRE>This problem occurs when text returned by the FTP server is in a format
that WinInet cannot parse correctly.
<P>
Firewalls: Authenticating with a particular firewall may not be possible,
depending on the particular method the firewall requires. If the usernames
and passwords for both the firewall and the destination FTP server cannot
be specified in the single username and password accepted by the
InternetConnect function, it is unlikely that WinInet will operate through
the firewall. If this is the case, the only options are to reconfigure the
firewall to accept authentication in the format that can be provided by
WinInet, remove the firewall, or do not use the WinInet FTP functions.
Limited FTP functionality may be achieved over a CERN proxy with the
InternetOpenUrl function.
