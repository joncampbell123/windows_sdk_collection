The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Internet Client SDK, versions 4.0, 4.01
<LI>Microsoft Visual Basic Professional and Enterprise Editions for
   Windows, version 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, versions 4.2, 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Active Document objects (also known as docobjs, .vbd files, and Active
Documents) are not released upon navigating to a different URL using
Internet Explorer. The server continues running even through several pages
of navigation. This can cause problems for Active Document servers that
expect the last reference to the Active Document object to be released upon
navigating away from the URL that points to the structured storage file.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Internet Explorer 4.0 uses an unexpected way to keep Active Document
servers in memory even after you have navigated away from the URL for the
structured storage file (such as .vbd files). Immediately prior to
releasing the reference to the displayed document, Internet Explorer will
create another (hidden) instance of the Active Document object and hold the
reference to that object for approximately 10 minutes, or when Internet
Explorer exits, whichever comes first.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Here is some information for Visual Basic developers:

<UL><LI>Do not use the Terminate event as a notification to shut down your
   Active Document server. The Terminate event will be fired once for each
   instance of the Active Document objects.

<LI>You will need to exit Internet Explorer  while testing your Active
   Document server project, rather than simply navigating away from the URL
   for the .vbd file.

<LI>Avoid placing code in the UserDocument's Initialize or Terminate event
   handlers that should be placed in other event handlers (see MORE
   INFORMATION, below).
<P>
</UL>Here is some information for Visual C++ developers:

<UL><LI>Do not expect the reference count for your docobj server to drop to 0
   (zero) when the user navigates away from the structured storage file
   associated with your docobj server.

<LI>This behavior mimics the intended behavior of the method
   IClassFactory::LockServer(). You should continue to rely upon that
   method to keep your server running even if there are no references held
   against your objects.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
NOTE: You should not make software design decisions that rely upon this
behavior. Microsoft reserves the right to change this behavior without
notice at any time.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
There is no specification that requires an Active Document container, such
as Internet Explorer 4.0, to maintain one and only one reference to an
Active Document for each displayed instance. It can create as many
instances as it likes.
<P>
Internet Explorer 4.0 uses this additional reference to keep the Active
Document server running. Many Active Document servers, such as the
Microsoft Office suite of applications, take a significant amount of time
to get started. By using this additional reference to the Active Document
object, Internet Explorer 4.0 can keep the server running, thus reducing
the time it takes to display a page that has recently been viewed by the
user.
<P>
Internet Explorer 3.x had a four-page "cache," which would hold references
to the current page as well as the last three visited pages. Although
Internet Explorer 4.0 does not have this four-page cache, the latent
reference to the Active Document certainly acts like a cache.
<P>
<P><h3>For Visual Basic Developers</h3>
 
<P>
Many Visual Basic developers have a tendency to place application startup
and shutdown code in the Initialize and Terminate event handlers,
respectively, of their UserDocument objects. It is extremely likely that
Initialize and Terminate events will overlap each other. In other words,
you cannot rely on a single Terminate event to follow each Initialize event
without other Initialize events in between. This makes the Initialize event
handler a poor place to put code that expects to be fired only once during
the lifetime of the Active Document server.
<P>
For instance, the following scenario can be expected to happen most times
while using Internet Explorer 4.0 to view an Active Document:
<P>
<PRE>   (... the user navigates to the URL of the VBD file ...)
   Sub Main executes (if applicable)
   UserDocument1_Initialize event fires (Instance #1)
   UserDocument1_InitProperties

    -or-

   UserDocument1_ReadProperties event fires (Instance #1)
   UserDocument1_Show event fires (Instance #1)
   (... other events ...)

   (... the user navigates to a different URL ...)
   UserDocument1_Hide event fires (Instance #1)
   UserDocument1_WriteProperties event fires (Instance #1; assumes the
      UserDocument.PropertyChanged method is called first)
   UserDocument1_Initialize event fires (Instance #2)
   UserDocument1_Terminate event fires (Instance #1)

   (... 10 minutes elapse, or the user exits IE4 ...)
   UserDocument1_Terminate event fires (Instance #2)
   (... the application terminates ...)
