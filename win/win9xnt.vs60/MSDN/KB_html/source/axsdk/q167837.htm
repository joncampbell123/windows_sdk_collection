Release notes for the Internet Client Software Development Kit
<P>
Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation, 1997
 
<P>
<P>
NOTE: If you did not access this document from &lt;your SDK
folder&gt;\help\default.htm, go to that location because it is a better
place to begin reading documentation.
<P>
This Readme.txt is the second URL in that document's left-hand frame. If
you are unfamiliar with the Internet Client SDK, you might want to look at
the Overview section. There is a great deal of new material and
technologies available through that section.
<P>
 
WELCOME TO THE INTERNET CLIENT SDK
 
<P>
These are the release notes for the Internet Explorer 4.0 version of the
SDK. This release has been tested primarily on Visual C++ 5.0, Windows 95
and Windows NT, and Internet Explorer 4.0 releases.
<P>
Here's a brief description of the contents of this folder, followed by
release notes:
<P>
<PRE>   BIN       SDK tools, DLLs, and self-extracting .exe files
   HELP      HTML documentation (Default.htm) for Web content and software
             development
   INCLUDE   Include files for Internet development
   LIB       Libraries for Internet development
   SAMPLES   Samples for Web content developers and software developers
   COMPLIB   Internet components (ActiveX Controls, Java applets, and so
             on)

</PRE> 
PREREQUISITES OF THIS RELEASE OF THE SDK
 
<P>
To do development with this SDK, you need to have installed on your
computer:

<UL><LI>Internet Explorer 4.0.

<LI>If you are developing software, the latest Win32 development files. You
   might already have installed these from the latest Platform SDK at
   <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/msdn/sdk/">http://www.microsoft.com/msdn/sdk/.</A></B> Otherwise, the
   subset you need is available as a download from the Internet Client SDK
   download page under "Win32 SDK Libraries &amp; Headers."

<LI>Windows 95 or Windows NT 4.0 SUR (final version).

<LI>Development tools, if you are building software. This product
   has been tested primarily on Visual C++ 5.0. (See "Configuration Issues"
   below for more information.)
<P>
</UL>Installing the SDK on Memphis Beta 1 hasn't been fully tested. If you try
this, you must upgrade the Memphis release with the latest Internet
Explorer 4.0 release.
<P>
 
INSTALLATION ISSUES -- CD AND INTERNET INSTALLS
 
<P>
ActiveSetup from the Internet:
<P>
Essentially the ActiveSetup from a CD is identical to the ActiveSetup from
the Web. One difference is that the CD will have an image of a fully
installed SDK. If for some reason you are unable to use ActiveSetup, this
should not prevent you from being able to use the documentation and seeing
the samples. Copying those files from the CD to your hard drive (without
using ActiveSetup) is not a supported method of installation.
<P>
The new Web site for installing the SDK is:
<B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/msdn/sdk/inetsdk/asetup/">http://www.microsoft.com/msdn/sdk/inetsdk/ASetup/</A></B>
<P>
The download site is designed to allow you to download the bits that you're
interested in, while ignoring the others for another day. You can return to
the site for incremental downloads that nicely integrate into your
installation. The downloads are targeted at three major development
tasks/audiences: Web and Desktop Content Providers, ActiveX Component
Developers, and Internet Application Developers. There is also a Component
Library with helpful Internet components such as the Microsoft Chat and
NetShow controls. A useful feature of the documentation is that it
integrates well on the client computer. If you make a jump from the
documentation to a set that you have not yet installed, the documentation
will invite you back to the download site to install that documentation
set. When you do this, the links will be resolved to the new pages.
<P>
 
GETTING STARTED ON DOCUMENTATION
 
<P>
The documentation has lots of great new content. The entry point is &lt;your
sdk dir.&gt;\help\default.htm. All documentation should be accessed through
this file. Accessing other HTML files directly will cause scripting errors
and break navigation links.
<P>
 
CONFIGURATION ISSUES
 
<P>
If you have Visual C++ 5.0 and the latest release of the Platform SDK, you
should set your environment variables by executing the following commands
on your command line (note: make exceptions to make sure you go to the
correct directories):
<P>
<PRE>   cd \vc\bin
   vcvars32 x86
   cd c:\mstools
   setenv c:\mstools
   cd c:\inetsdk
   setenv c:\inetsdk

</PRE>If you have Visual C++ 5.0 and installed the Win32 development files from
the Internet Client SDK, you should set your environment variables by
executing the following commands on your command line (again note: make
exceptions to make sure you use the correct directories):
<P>
<PRE>   cd \vc\bin
   vcvars32 x86
   cd c:\inetsdk
   setenv c:\inetsdk

</PRE>If a set of Win32 development files wasn't found in either case, you will
be warned not to pursue development.
<P>
If you are developing on a Windows 95 computer, you will want to increase
your environment space. You can do this by changing "Initial environment"
on the "Memory" tab of the "Properties" menu, which is accessible by
clicking in the extreme upper-left corner of your MS-DOS prompt window.
<P>
 
BUILDING/USING SAMPLES
 
<P>
For both software and content developers, the samples are located in the
\samples directory, and are often referenced in the documentation as
examples. The Samples.htm file (accessible from Default.htm) provides more
detailed information about each sample.
<P>
You will find several new samples targeted at content development. These
are not the traditional type of samples that use compilers or linkers--
these are HTML and CDF samples, and others, that show you how to use or
develop content on Web pages.
<P>
For software developers, each sample that produces a binary has a makefile
in its directory. You can execute all of these recursively by executing
...\samples\makeall.bat. All samples should build on Visual C++ 5.0.
<P>
Several of the ChatOCX samples are Visual Basic samples. You will need to
have Visual Basic installed to build and execute these samples.
<P>
 
WHAT'S IN THE \BIN DIRECTORY
 
<P>
Lots of new, good stuff!
<P>
Many of the following are self-extracting CAB files; you can read more
about them in the documentation or in the .txt files in the \bin directory.
Upon download, these file are installed in either the \bin directory of
the \complib directory.

<P>
</UL> 
KNOWN ISSUES OR BUGS
 
<P>
MSTASK.H:
<P>
The Task Scheduler interface introduced during beta as ISchedulingAgent has
been renamed to ITaskScheduler in the final release of the product. This is
FYI only, no recompile is necessary.
<P>
BLEND TRANSITION - CSS:
<P>
Attempting to assign a shape value (for example, Box-In, Wipe-Left) in a
script to a Blend transition causes Internet Explorer to GPF. Don't do
this. Setting a shape value to a Blend Transition in CSS is ignored.
<P>
This will most likely happen when authors are editing code that changes a
Reveal Transition to a Blend Transition without taking out any code that
sets the transition shape.
<P>
BINDINFO and ATL:
<P>
The BINDINFO structure has changed size between Internet Explorer 3.x and
Internet Explorer 4.0. There are more details in the documentation for
BINDINFO that tells how to check this structure and how it applies to your
code.
<P>
Some of the ATL samples in this SDK--Glass, IEMime, and TDC for example--
use classes based on the ATL CBindStatusCallback class, which implements
asynchronous moniker downloads. The version of ATL shipping with Visual C++
5.0 fails to release some interfaces and handles the size of the BINDINFO
structure incorrectly inside CBindStatusCallback. The Glass IEMime and TDC
samples are not affected because they provide their own revised
CBindStatusCallback implementations. However, any customers who create
projects based on these SDK samples but use CBindStatusCallback directly
should be aware of these issues. ATL users should also be aware. Microsoft
is currently planning to resolve these problems in a future Service Pack
for Visual Studio.
<P>
OBJBASE.H
<P>
CoCreateStandardMalloc is defined in the Objbase.h header file, however
this function is obsolete and will be removed in a future release.
Attempting to use this in your code will generate unresolved symbol errors
during linking. CoGetMalloc should be used instead.
<P>
 
LATE BREAKING DOCUMENTATION UPDATES
 
<P>
AUTHENTICODE RELEASE NOTES:
<P>
The following functionality has been added to the CertMgr program.
<P>
Putting Certificates, CTLs, and CRLs with CertMgr
<P>
The following syntax can be used to invoke CertMgr to put an X509 encoded
certificate, CTL, or CRL into a file:
<P>
<PRE>   CertMgr -put [options] [-s [-r registryLocation]] SourceStore FileName

</PRE>SourceStore is the source certificate store that contains the existing
certificates, CTLs, and CRLs. FileName is the file to which an X509 encoded
certificate, CTL, and CRL will be saved. If the -7 option is used, the file
will be saved as a PKCS#7.
<P>
CertMgr can put either certificates, CTLs, or CRLs. If there is more than
one item in one of these categories, the user has two options:

<OL><P><LI>Use the -n and -sha1 options to uniquely identify the item.

<P><LI>Do not specify any options, and CertMgr will prompt the user with a list
   of items to put. The user responds by entering the index of the item to
   add.
<P>
   The options are:
<P>
<PRE>      -c     Put certificates.

      -CTL   Put CTLs.

      -CRL   Put CRLs.

      -7     Save the certificate, CRL, or CTL as a PKCS#7.

      -e encodingType      Certificate encoding type.

      -y storeProviderType Store provider type.

      -f dwFlags           Store open flag. This is the dwFlags parameter
                           passed to CertOpenStore. The default value is
                           CERT_SYSTEM_STORE_CURRENT_USER. Meaningful only
                           if -y is set. For more information see the
                           CryptoAPI 2.0 documentation.

      -n commonNameString  The common name of the certificate to
                           put. Can be used only with certificates.

      -s                   Indicates the SourceStore is a system store. If
                           this option is not set, the store is a
                           StoreFile.

      -sha1 sha1Hash       The SHA1 hash of the certificate, CTL, or CRL to
                           add.

      -r registryLocation  Identifies the registry location of the system
                           certificate store. Meaningful only when -s is
                           set. Must be set to either currentUser or
                           localMachine. CurrentUser is the default.

                           currentUser means that the certificate store is
                           under the registry key HKEY_CURRENT_USER,
                           localMachine means HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE.

      -?                   Displays all the options.


   The following example puts an X509 encoded certificate, that is located
   in the Root certificate store, to a file called newCert.cer. The
   certificate's common name is "myCert".

      certmgr -put -c -n myCert -s root newCert.cer

</PRE></OL>UPDATE/CORRECTIONS TO DHTML FILTERS AND TRANSITIONS DOCUMENTATION:

<UL><LI>When chaining together filters and transitions, it is advised that
   transitions be specified at the end of the list.

<LI>Under the section titled, "Properties, Methods, and Events" it lists
   Duration and Status as transition properties. There should also be
   listed the Enabled property, which is present on all visual filters and
   transitions. A value of FALSE will disable the visual filter or
   transition. A value of TRUE means the visual filter or transition is
   active. The default value is TRUE. This value can be set both in the
   style sheet and through script.

<LI>The Enabled link on the Filters and Transitions page mistakenly jumps
   to the Enabled property for the Active Move control

<LI>In the overview for Transitions, the Play  and Stop links mistakenly
   jump to the Play and Stop properties for the NetShow Player Audio
   control. Jumping to the link will also install the control if it hasn't
   already been installed.

<LI>In the Creating Multimedia Effect With Visual Filters and Transitions
   section, the Duration link mistakenly jumps to the Duration property
   for the NetShow Player Audio control.  Jumping to the link will also
   install the control if it hasn't already been installed.

<LI>The first "Show Me" example uses improper syntax:
<P>
<P><PRE>      &lt;img id=sample src="sample.jpg" style="filter:blur(amount=2)
<PRE></PRE>        flipv()"&gt;

   should be:

      &lt;img id=sample src="sample.jpg" style="filter:blur(strength=2)
       flipv()"&gt;

</PRE><LI>The Glow filter's Strength property has a range from 1 to 255, not 0 to
   100.

<LI>The example for the sentence, "Timers create cyclical effects, as in
   the following interactive demonstration." is not a good example. It
   does not work as intended.

<LI>The Transition Wizard may produce a scripting error when trying to
   demonstrate the code generated. This is only a problem when showing how
   the code works within the Wizard. The code it generates will work
   normally when cut-and-copied to an HTML document.

<LI>Disregard the explanatory text after the list of filter names under the
   Visual Filters subheader under Visual Transition Filters Reference.
