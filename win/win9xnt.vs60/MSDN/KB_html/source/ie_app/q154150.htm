<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you choose to disconnect from the news server after downloading 
messages by clicking Post And Download on the Offline menu in Internet 
News, you may remain connected to your Internet service provider (ISP) 
after the messages are downloaded.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior can occur if you established your Internet connection with
a program other than Internet News.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Quit the program that you used to connect to the Internet.
<PRE> 
</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When a program loads Dial-Up Networking and sends a dial command to
establish a connection to an Internet server, the connection between the 
client computer and the server is essentially the same as being connected 
to a local area network (LAN) with a network cable. It can be helpful to 
consider your modem as a second network adapter in your computer, as it is 
available as a network connection to any program on the computer.
<P>
Any program that tries to make a network connection transparently uses the
Dial-Up Networking connection first (the Dial-Up Networking connection
becomes the primary connection, and any available LAN connections are 
secondary connections). Dial-Up Networking is not aware of which (if any) 
programs are passing data across the connection. Dial-Up Networking also 
does not record which program originally sent the dial command to 
establish a connection.
