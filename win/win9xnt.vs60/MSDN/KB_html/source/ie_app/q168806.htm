<P><h3>Determining the Scope of the Java Problem</h3>
 
<P>
To determine the scope of the Java problem, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Access either of the following Microsoft Java Web sites at the
   following Web page addresses:
<P>
<P><PRE>      <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/ie/most/howto/java.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/ie/most/howto/java.htm</A></B>
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/ie/ie40/features/">http://www.microsoft.com/ie/ie40/features/</A></B> (click Java on the right-
      hand menu)
</PRE>
<P><LI>If the Java program operates correctly, the problem is probably
   specific to one Web site. Follow the steps in the "Java Problems on One
   Web Site" section in this article. If neither of the Java programs
   operate correctly, the problem is most likely specific to all Web
   sites. Follow the steps in the "Java Problems on All Web Sites" section
   in this article.
<P>
</OL><h3>Java Problems on One Web Site</h3>
 
<P>
If you are unable to view a Web site that contains Java programs, but are
able to view other Web sites that contain Java programs, follow these
steps to resolve the issue:

<OL><P><LI>Access the following Web site:

   link. Click I Accept, and then click Build &lt;XXXX&gt; For Windows95/NT
   (x86), where &lt;XXXX&gt; is a build number equal to or greater than 1517.
   This installs the Microsoft Virtual Machine for Java update.

<P><LI>Access the Web site that exhibited the problem, and test to determine
   if the issue has been resolved. If the issue has not been resolved,
   continue with step 4.

<P><LI>Right-click the Internet Explorer icon on the desktop, and then click
   Properties on the menu that appears.

<P><LI>On the Advanced tab, click the Enable Java JIT Compiler check box to
   clear it, and then click OK.

<P><LI>Access the Web site that exhibited the problem, and test to determine
   if the issue has been resolved.

       files, choose No. When you are prompted to load all Windows
       drivers, choose Yes, and then hold down the SHIFT key while Windows
       starts to prevent items in the Startup group from being processed.

    g. Follow the steps in the "Determining the Scope of the Java Problem"
       section in this article to determine if the issue has been
       resolved. If the issue has been resolved, continue with step 15. If
       the issue has not been resolved, skip to step 17.

</PRE><P><LI>Remove each of the programs from the Startup group individually to
<P><PRE>    isolate the problem program, restarting Windows after each program
    you move. To do so, drag a program from the Windows\Start
    Menu\Programs\StartUp folder to another folder, and then restart
    Windows. Follow the steps in the "Determining the Scope of the Java
    Problem" section in this article to determine if the issue has been
    resolved. If the issue has not been resolved, drag another program
    from the Startup group, and so on. If the issue still has not been
    resolved after all programs are removed from the Startup group,
    continue with step 16.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Isolate any conflicts with terminate-and-stay-resident program (TSR)
<P><PRE>    or real-mode device drivers. To do so, restart your computer by
    clicking Start, clicking Shut Down, clicking Shut Down the Computer,
    and then clicking Yes. When you see the "Starting Windows 95" message,
    press the F8 key, and then choose Step By Step Confirmation from the
    Startup menu. Press the N key (for No) for every TSR or real-mode
    device driver. When Windows restarts, follow the steps in the
    "Determining the Scope of the Java Problem" section in this article to
    determine if the issue has been resolved. If the issue has not been
    resolved, skip to step 18.
</PRE>
<P><LI>If you connect to the Internet using a modem, skip to step 18. If you
<P><PRE>    connect to the Internet using a local area network (LAN), contact your
    network system administrator and verify that you have access to Java
    programs through the network firewall. If you have access to Java
    programs through the network firewall, continue with step 18.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Please contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information and
