The information in this article applies to:

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes the purpose of cookies, where they are stored by
Internet Explorer, and how you can remove them from your hard disk.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Cookies are bits of information written to your computer about you and
your visits to Web pages. Cookies can include the following types of
information:
<P>
<P><h3>Custom Pages</h3>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Network custom page (The MSN) is an example of a large
cookie. After you select the options you want for your Web page, the
server writes that information to your cookie to retrieve when you visit
the page at a later time.
<P>
<P><h3>Shopping</h3>
 
<P>
If you visit a site that features a "shopping cart" of items you want to
purchase, a cookie can keep track of what you put in your cart. If you
need to leave the Web page, the items your shopping cart will be exactly
as you left it when you return. This keeps you from having to fill the
"shopping cart" again.
<P>
<P><h3>Tracking Visits</h3>
 
<P>
A webmaster can give you a cookie to track repeat visits to a Web page.
<P>
<P><h3>Cookies Locations</h3>
 
<P>
Cookies are stored in different locations depending on the version of
Internet Explorer you are running.
<P>
Internet Explorer Versions 2.0 and 2.1:
<P>
Cookies are stored in the System Folder:Preferences:Explorer:Cookies.txt
file. To remove any unwanted cookies, you can either delete the
Cookies.txt file, or you can edit the file with a text editor and remove
any cookies you do not want. Note that you may want to make a backup
copy of the Cookies.txt file before you delete it.
<P>
Internet Explorer Version 3.0:
<P>
Cookies are stored in the System Folder:Preferences:Internet Preferences
file. To remove any unwanted cookies, delete the Preferences file. This
file is also used by Internet Config and may contain preferences used by
other Internet-based programs (mail programs, news readers, ftp programs,
and so on). Do not delete this file unless you are sure you have written
down all of the settings.
<P>

Cookies are stored in the System Folder:Preferences:Internet Preferences
file. To remove any unwanted cookies, follow these steps:

   to delete under Cookies Settings.

<P>
<PRE>   Setting               Description
   --------------------------------------------------------------------
   Never Ask             Cookies are always accepted and you are never
                         prompted before a cookie is saved to your hard
                         disk.
   Ask For Each Site     You are asked for each site whether you want
                         to accept or decline cookies from the site.
   Ask For Each Cookie   As each cookie arrives, you are asked if you
                         want to accept it.
   Never Accept          Cookies are never accepted and you are never
                         prompted.
