Microsoft(r) Internet Explorer 3.0 for Macintosh(r)
<P>
Welcome
<P>
Microsoft(r) Internet Explorer is a World Wide Web (WWW) browser for the
Macintosh. The WWW is the fastest growing component of the Internet today
and the first to display styled text and graphics. In order to use a WWW
browser, you will need a modem or network access, access to the Internet,
and software that enables your computer to communicate with the Internet.
<P>
<P><h3>Requirements</h3>
 
<P>
System Requirements

<UL><LI>Power Macintosh
<LI>System 7.1 and above
<LI>8 MB of RAM
<LI>2-5 MB of hard disk space
<P>
</UL>Attention 68k Users:
This version of Internet Explorer doesn't run on 68000 Macintoshes. For
68000 builds and updates visit <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/ie/mac">http://www.microsoft.com/ie/mac.</A></B>
<P>
<P><h3>Access to the Internet</h3>
 
<P>
You must have access to the Internet through an Internet Service Provider
or the network to which your computer is connected.
<P>
Internet software

<UL><LI>Open Transport 1.0.8 or greater (Extension) &amp; TCP/IP (Control Panel)
<LI>If you are a dial-up user, Config PPP or similar PPP connection
   software (Control Panel) with PPP (Extension)
<P>
</UL><h3>New and Improved Features in version 3.0</h3>
 
<P>
Java(r)
<P>
Java is one of the most important new technologies appearing on the Web.
Java applets are actual downloadable software components that can bring new
and powerful functionality to Internet Explorer. Java applets can be as
rich and varied as any Macintosh application but with the size and variety
of the Internet behind them. With the power of downloadable software
components come new concerns for the privacy and security of your system.
Internet Explorer gives you peace-of-mind by providing you with complete
control over what a Java applet can do and cannot do. At the highest
security level, you can prevent Java applets from accessing your local hard
disk and sending and receiving information over the Internet, thus
guaranteeing the integrity and privacy of your personal data.
Alternatively, you can choose to lower the security on applets you trust.
<P>
For more information on Java, visit
<B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/workshop/java/java.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/workshop/java/java.htm.</A></B>
<P>
Note: Java is turned off by default, to turn it on:
<PRE>   1. Choose Preferences from the Edit Menu.
   2. Click the Web Content tab.
   3. Enable the Java check box.

</PRE>Cascading Style Sheets
<P>
Style sheets make Web pages come alive through their support of fonts,
spacing and margin control, color, and image backgrounds. This new
specification from the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) gives Web page
designers greater design flexibility by describing a whole new set of tags
for adding visual features to HTML. Most importantly, you can control the
entire appearance of a Web site from a single file, thereby allowing you to
update the look of every page on your site simultaneously. It eliminates
the need of GIF/JPEG images to show styles and reduces download time and
memory requirements significantly.
<P>
For more information on style sheets, visit
<B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/workshop/author/howto/css-f.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/workshop/author/howto/css-f.htm.</A></B>
<P>
Internet Ratings Support
<P>
Internet ratings support allows users/parents to filter out Web sites that
could be inappropriate for minors. Parents can use password protected
categories and rating levels assigned by the Recreational Software Advisory
Council (RSAC). For example, parents can specify whether their child may
view sites that contain profane language, nudity, or violence.
<P>
Customizable Toolbar
<P>
A new customizable toolbar lets you control the size and placement of the
Favorites Bar, Button Bar, and Address Bar. The Favorites Bar is a new
addition to the toolbar. You can drag items from your desktop or the
Favorites window and drop them onto the Favorites Bar for quick and easy
access to frequently used sites.
<P>
ActiveX
<P>
ActiveX native support provides a rich environment for Macintosh developers
to create content-rich, interactive Web pages. You can use the Preferences
dialog box to turn ActiveX support on and off and to determine whether to
show an alert before downloading an ActiveX control.
<P>
For more information on ActiveX, visit
<B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/intdev/sdk/mac">http://www.microsoft.com/intdev/sdk/mac.</A></B>
<P>
Internet Config Support
<P>
If Internet Config is not already installed on your machine, Internet
Explorer 3.0 will install it and store Internet Config preferences in the
Internet Preferences file. This allows you to share your preferences with
other Internet applications such as Internet Mail &amp; News and Personal Web
Server. You can change your Internet Preferences using Internet Explorer or
Internet Config.
<P>
Other Improvements
<P>
URL Expansion: You can now type browserwatch in the Address bar and it will
expand it to <B><A href="http://www.browserwatch.com">http://www.browserwatch.com.</A></B>
<P>
<P><h3>Known Issues</h3>
 
<P>
Java
<P>
You may experience problems running a Java applet when Java is enabled. If
this happens, then the applet is most likely failing byte code
verification.
<P>
If you would still like to run the applet:
<PRE>   1. Choose Preferences from the Edit Menu
   2. Click the Web Content tab.
   3. In the Enhancements section, change the Byte Code verification to
      Don't Check Code.

</PRE>Note:  Please remember that you are running unverified Java applets, which
means that neither the byte code on your local drive nor on the network is
inspected.
<P>
You may not be able to view large Java applets on 8MB machines when there
is not enough system memory free. This occurs because the Java Virtual
Machine is loaded and unloaded dynamically in the System memory. Memory is
used only when you view pages with Java applications.
<P>
ActiveX
<P>
Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0 for Macintosh has native ActiveX support,
and does not require the use of a plug-in. The Microsoft ActiveX Plug-in
included with this installer is for use with older versions of Internet
Explorer or other browsers that use plug-ins and do not have native support
for ActiveX.
<P>
Note: Please be aware that in this release, Internet Explorer cannot verify
the integrity of ActiveX controls. Download and use ActiveX controls from
trusted servers only.
<P>
QuickTime and PowerPlug
<P>
If you have QuickTime installed, Internet Explorer requires that the
QuickTime PowerPlug be installed in your Extensions folder in your System
folder. QuickTime extensions are available for download from
<B>http://quicktime.apple.com.</B>
<P>
Internet Config File Mappings table
<P>
Internet Explorer maintains an internal list of viewers that tell it how to
handle different types of documents. In this release, this list is exported
and merged with the Internet Config File Mappings table. As a result,
please consider the following:

<UL><LI>Internet Explorer's list of viewers is indexed by the MIME types
   (Multimedia Internet Mail Extensions) of incoming documents. Since
   Internet Explorer cannot use a viewer without a MIME type, it will
   ignore them, but not delete or alter file mappings in Internet Config
   that do not contain a MIME type.

<LI>Internet Explorer maintains only one table entry per MIME type. If you
   have multiple file mappings in Internet Config with the same MIME type,
   Internet Explorer will use only the last setting in the table.

<LI>Internet Explorer adds a small amount of information to each file
   mapping in Internet Config to store its "How to Handle" setting. When
   you choose "Use Explorer as a Viewer," Internet Explorer always
   attempts to handle the document type, regardless of the settings in
   Internet Config. Most file formats use the viewer specified in Internet
   Config, however, certain file formats like GIF and JPEG are handled by
   Internet Explorer regardless of your Internet Config setting.
