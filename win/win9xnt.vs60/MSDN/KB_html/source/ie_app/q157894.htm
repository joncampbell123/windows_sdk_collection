<P>
If the method described in this article does not function properly,

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how to use Microsoft Internet Explorer version 2.1
for Windows 3.1 with America Online (AOL) as your Internet service
provider.
<P>
NOTE: This procedure can be used when you are running Internet Explorer
2.1 for Windows 3.1 with Windows or Windows for Workgroups version 3.x,
Windows 95, or Windows NT Workstation or Windows NT Server version 3.x or
later. However, it cannot be used when you are running any version of
Internet Explorer for Windows 95 or Internet Explorer for Windows NT.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To use Internet Explorer 2.1 with AOL as your Internet service provider,
follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Download the Dlmini21.exe file from an online service (such as the
   Microsoft <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/ie/">http://www.microsoft.com/ie/</A></B> Web site) to an empty folder and
   then double-click the file to install Internet Explorer 2.1. For
   additional information about obtaining the Dlmini21.exe file or
   installing Internet Explorer 2.1 for Windows 3.1, please see the
   following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../ie_app/q148875.htm">Q148875</A></B>
<PRE></PRE>      TITLE     : Microsoft Internet Explorer 2.1 for Windows 3.1
                  Available

   NOTE: If you have already installed Internet Explorer 2.1 using the
   Dlfull21.exe or Dlbase21.exe file, uninstall Internet Explorer 2.1. To
   do this, follow these steps:

   a. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

   b. Double-click Add/Remove Programs.

   c. On the Install/Uninstall tab, click Internet Explorer 2.1 in the
      list of installed programs, and then click Add/Remove.


   Then, reinstall Internet Explorer 2.1 using the Dlmini21.exe file
   instead. You can also install Internet Explorer 2.1 using the
   Dlfull21.exe or Dlbase21.exe file; but if you do so, you must perform a
   Custom installation and choose not to install the dialer tool.

</PRE><P><LI>Download the Winsock.dll file version 2.5 that is available from AOL
   and use Windows Explorer to copy it to the Microsoft Internet folder
   (the folder in which you installed Internet Explorer).
<P>
   The Winsock.dll file version 2.5 is not included with the America
   Online software. For information about obtaining this file, please
   contact America OnLine.

<P><LI>Connect to AOL and then run Internet Explorer.
<P>
   NOTE: Internet Explorer cannot be configured to automatically dial AOL
   when AOL is used as your Internet service provider.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: America Online has released a version of America Online for Windows
95. This software installs an America Online adapter in Network properties
that lets you make a 32-bit Transmission Control Protocol/Internet
Protocol (TCP/IP) connection to America Online. If you use this software,
you can use the 32-bit version of Internet Explorer and no other
configuration is necessary.
