Windows 95 Driver Library
<P>
<P>
If you are an individual Windows 95 user
<P>
If you are an individual user and just want to update your version of
Windows 95 to version 950a, see  Servpack.doc in the root directory on the
Windows 95 Service Pack 1 CD.
<P>
Update to Windows 95
<P>
Microsoft Windows 95 Service Pack 1 includes an update for Windows 95.
Installing this updates your version of Windows 95 to version 4.00.950a.
This section explains how to install the update and describes the contents
of the update.
<P>
<P>
Note
The update is designed to solve specific issues. If these issues do not
apply to your configuration(s), you might not need to install the update.
For more information about the Update, see the section "What does the
Windows 95 Service Pack 1 Update do?" later in this document.
<P>
<P>
Updating a Single Computer
<P>
This section explains how to install the Service Pack 1 Update on a single
computer running Windows 95.
<P>
To install the update on a single computer

<OL><P><LI>Quit any applications that are currently running. If you use
   the Microsoft Plus! System Agent, right-click the System Agent
   icon on the toolbar, and then click Suspend System Agent.
<P>
   2. Insert the Windows 95 Service Pack 1 CD.

<P><LI>  Double-click the Setup.exe file, and then follow the
   instructions on your screen.
<P>
<P>
</OL>Note
Do not click Cancel during Setup. Doing so may cause Setup to fail. This
may be true even though a message is displayed stating that your system was
updated successfully. If you do click Cancel during Setup by mistake, run
Setup again. If Windows asks "Do you want to overwrite the file:" click Yes
To All.
<P>
When the Setup.exe program completes, your version of Windows 95 will be
updated to version 4.00.950a.
<P>
To remove the update from your computer

<OL><P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click
   Control Panel.

<P><LI>Double-click Add/Remove Programs.

<P><LI>Click the Install/Uninstall tab, click Windows 95 Service Pack 1,
   then click Add/Remove.

<P><LI>Follow the instructions on your screen.
<P>
</OL>Notes
Removing the update from your computer will remove all updates except the
Password List Update and your system version will remain 4.00.950a. The
original Password List version cannot read the new password list. If you
would like to uninstall the service pack completely, you should reinstall
Windows 95 from your original upgrade disks over the existing Windows 95
installation.
<P>
During the update the  Service Pack version of Net.exe is also copied to
Netpwl.exe.  This file can be used if Net.exe is overwritten.  Net.exe may
be overwritten by network setup while adding or removing network
components.
<P>
The Service Pack includes an update to Microsoft Exchange that enables
users to use shared (public) folders on the post office with Microsoft
Mail. If you use Microsoft Mail, then after installing the Service Pack
updates, you need to carry out the following procedure in order to use
shared folders. (You do not need to carry out this procedure if you do not
use the Microsoft Mail service in Microsoft Exchange.)
<P>
To reconfigure Microsoft Exchange to use shared folders (if you use
Microsoft Mail)

<OL><P><LI>In the \Admin\Componts\Updates\Exchupd folder, run Exchupd.exe.

<P><LI>In Control Panel, double-click the Mail And Fax icon.

<P><LI>Click the Microsoft Mail information service, and then click
   Remove.

<P><LI>Click Add, and then select Microsoft Mail from the list of
   services.

<P><LI>In the Microsoft Mail configuration dialog box , click the
   Connection tab.

<P><LI>In the Edit box, type the path to your Microsoft Mail post
   office.

<P><LI>On the Logon tab, type your mailbox and password.

<P><LI>To add the service, click OK, and then click OK again to save
   the changes to your profile.
<P>
</OL>What Does the Windows 95 Service Pack 1 Update Do?
<P>
This section explains what each Service Pack update does. Most updates
address a specific problem or a specific configuration. These updates have
previously been available to download from various electronic locations
such as the Microsoft Web site and MSN - The Microsoft Network.
<P>
OLE32 Update
<P>
The Windows 95 OLE 32 update addresses file-management behavior in
Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95.
Because of the way these applications use OLE for file storage, files
created by these applications might contain extraneous data from previously
deleted files. This data is not visible while you use the applications.
However, when such a document file is viewed by using Windows Notepad (for
example), it might be possible to see pieces of information from the
previously deleted files. This could pose information security or privacy
concerns if you distribute electronic versions of files created using these
<P>
applications.
<P>
Notes
If you use Microsoft Office with Windows NT , this problem does not affect
you, because the operating system initializes (clears) any disk space used
by deleted files. If you use Microsoft Word 6.0, Microsoft Excel 5.0, or
Microsoft PowerPoint 4.0 with Windows version 3.1 or on an Apple Macintosh
computer, contact Microsoft Customer Services to obtain the "C" maintenance
releases of these products. Early releases of these versions are known to
have a similar extraneous-data problem, which is fixed in the "C" releases.
<P>
Microsoft Windows 95 Shell Update
<P>
This update to the Windows 95 Shell32.dll file fixes a problem in which
files copied onto themselves can be truncated to a zero-byte file size.
This occurs only in the following circumstances:
<P>
- When you copy a file onto itself using two different views of the
<PRE>  same network resource (these can be different mapped drive letters
  or UNC connections to a network resource)

</PRE></OL>- When you copy a file onto itself using a drive that was created by
<PRE>  the SUBST command

</PRE>This update to Shell32.dll also makes it possible to browse NetWare
Directory Service printers from the Add Printer wizard.  The Add Printer
Wizard is found in the Printers folder.  This change is applicable to you
if you have installed Service for NetWare Directory Services.
<P>
Windows 95 Common Dialog Update for Windows 3.1 Legacy Printer Drivers
<P>
In Windows 95, when 32-bit applications print using Windows 3.1 monolithic
drivers or the Windows 3.1 Pscript.drv / Unidrv.dll driver, the
applications sometimes fail. This update addresses that problem.
<P>
Vserver Update: File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks
<P>
Microsoft is issuing an update for a known problem with File and Printer
Sharing for Microsoft Networks and a certain UNIX shareware network client
(Samba's SMBCLIENT). The update corrects a problem with share-level
security documented in the Microsoft Knowledge Base on October 9th, 1995.
The update also includes a correction for a similar problem with user-level
security that Microsoft recently discovered as part of its internal testing
of the new driver.
<P>
Note
The phrase "Microsoft Networks" refers to Microsoft's networking software,
not MSN (The Microsoft Network online service).
<P>
Windows 95 enables users of the Samba SMBCLIENT to access the drive on
which sharing is enabled by accepting certain specific networking commands.
<P>
The Samba client is the only known SMB client that sends such networking
commands. SMBCLIENT users do not automatically have access to the Windows
95 drive, and must know the exact steps to send these commands.
<P>
The updated driver prevents Windows 95 from accepting these commands,
preventing SMBCLIENT users from accessing the drive on which sharing is
enabled. With the updated driver, an SMBCLIENT user will only have access
to those shared folders that a Windows 95 user has designated.
<P>
NWServer Update: File and Printer Sharing for NetWare Networks
<P>
Microsoft was recently made aware of an issue with File and Printer sharing
for NetWare Networks which might affect data security for corporate users.
If your computer is configured for file and printer sharing and Remote
Administration is enabled, another user on the network might gain read-only
access to your computer after the administrator has logged off the computer
and before you have restarted your computer. To correct this problem,
Microsoft has issued an updated driver for File and Printer Sharing for
NetWare Networks. The updated driver ensures that only valid administrators
have access to the computer's drive.
<P>
Vredir Update
<P>
The Vredir Update fixes a problem that affects only Windows 95 users who
use Samba servers. The problem arises from the basic Windows 95 and UNIX
filename formats. UNIX allows filenames that include the \ and *
characters, but in Windows 95, these are wildcard characters. Suppose that
a Samba server contains a file named \\server\share\*.*, a legal UNIX
filename. If a Windows 95 user connects to that server and tries to delete
the *.* file by using Windows Explorer, all the files on \\server\share are
deleted instead. This updated version of Vredir prevents this from
happening by rejecting filenames that contain the \ or * characters.
<P>
Windows 95 Password List Update
<P>
The Windows 95 Password List Update protects your password file against
potential security violations.
<P>
When you connect to a password-protected resource, such as a network drive,
you can choose to save that password. Windows then stores the password in
an encrypted file on your hard disk. Recently, an algorithm was posted on
the Internet for decrypting this file. If someone has access to your
password file and knows the decryption algorithm, they might be able to
decrypt it and the passwords it contains and then gain access to the
password-protected resources. The Password List Update provides vastly
improved encryption that is 2^96 (2 to the 96th power) harder to decrypt
than the previous encryption method.
<P>
Microsoft Plus! Update (System Agent Update)
<P>
The Microsoft Plus! Update provides an updated version of Sage.dll to fix a
minor problem with System Agent: When version 1.0 System Agent is running,
programs that perform floating-point calculations might be slightly off in
precision. This problem does not occur if System Agent is turned off.
<P>
Note
If you do not have Microsoft Plus! installed on your computer, this update
will have no effect on your system. If you install Microsoft Plus! at a
later date (after the Microsoft Plus! Update has been installed), Microsoft
Plus! Setup will leave the updated version of Sage.dll file on your system.
<P>
Microsoft Exchange Update
<P>
This update provides a version of Microsoft Exchange that supersedes the
version of Exchange included with Windows 95. The updated version enables
users running Microsoft Exchange with Windows 95 to access their Microsoft
Mail shared folders. (The Microsoft Mail information service included with
Windows 95 does not provide access to shared folders.)
<P>
Important
To use shared folders with Microsoft Mail, you must reconfigure Microsoft
Exchange after installing the Service Pack updates. To reconfigure
Microsoft Exchange, follow the second procedure in "Updating a Single
Computer" earlier in this document.
<P>
Printer Port (Lpt.vxd) Update
<P>
This Lpt.vxd Update adds support for ECP (Enhanced Communication Parallel)
port bi-directional communications used with certain printers (such as the
Hewlett-Packard LaserJet Series 4 and 5 printers, some Lexmark
LaserPrinters, and possibly others). It may prevent timeout errors when
printing.
<P>
Notes
The Lpt.vxd Update was included in the Drivers\Printer\LPT folder on the
Windows 95 CD-ROM; however, it was not installed by default during setup.
<P>
The file dates on the updates have been adjusted to "12-31-95  9:50AM."
Setup uses internal version information when updating files, so the date
change will not affect adding the same components again from an electronic
site or if you have previously installed them.
<P>
