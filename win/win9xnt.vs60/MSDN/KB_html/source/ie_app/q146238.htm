SLIP standard. (For more information about SLIP, see the Microsoft Windows
95 Resource Kit.)
<P>
Scripting support makes it possible for you to use scripts with Dial-Up
Networking. Many online service providers require you to enter information
such as your user name and password in order to establish a connection.
With Dial-Up Scripting, you can write a script to automate this process.
For more information, see "Creating Dial-Up Networking Scripts" later in
this document.
<P>
Who Should Install SLIP and Scripting Support?
<P>
You should install SLIP and scripting support if:
<P>
<PRE>   You use Dial-Up Networking and want to create scripts to automate the
   connection process.

   -or-

Microsoft 32-Bit DLC Protocol for Windows 95
<P>
The Data Link Control (DLC) protocol is used primarily to access IBM
mainframe and IBM(r) AS/400 computers. The 32-bit DLC protocol software for
Windows 95 enables a network administrator to add support for 32-bit and
16-bit DLC programs. Host terminal-emulation programs use this protocol to
communicate directly with mainframe computers. The DLC protocol is not used
<P>
for general networking with Windows 95.
<P>
Who Should Install the 32-Bit DLC Protocol?
<P>
You should install the 32-Bit DLC protocol if you are a network
administrator and want to provide access to IBM mainframe and/or IBM AS/400
<P>
computers by using 32-bit and 16-bit DLC programs (for example, host
terminal-emulation programs).
<P>
Installing and Configuring the 32-Bit DLC Protocol
<P>
It's easy to install the 32-Bit DLC Protocol files.
<P>
To install the 32-Bit DLC Protocol files on a single machine
<P>
<PRE>   1. In Control Panel, double-click Network.

   2. Click Add, and then click Protocol.

</PRE><P><LI>Click Have Disk, and then open the \Admin\Componts\Msdlc32
   folder.

<P><LI>   Select Microsoft 32-bit DLC, and then click OK. Setup will copy
   the DLC files.

<P><LI>To select DLC options, click Advanced in the properties for the
   protocol.
<P>
</OL>To configure the 32-Bit DLC protocol
<P>
For more information about configuring the 32-bit DLC protocol, see the
Readme.doc document located in the folder that contains your 32-Bit DLC
Protocol files.
<P>
To install the 32 Bit DLC protocol on more than one machine or add to an
automated Windows 95 Setup
<P>
For specific instructions about installing the 32-Bit DLC Protocol on
single and multiple desktops, double-click the Dlc32.hlp file in that
folder.
<P>
Dlc32.hlp will be copied to the \Windows\Help directory during a server-
based install setup (Netdlc32.sbs), but will not be copied if installed
using the Have Disk method (Netdlc32.inf).  If  you want Dlc32.hlp in the
\Windows\Help directory, you will need to copy it manually.
<P>
Important
Some corrections and additions to the DLC32.HLP information:
<P>
"Copy the following line to the [Network] section of the Msbatch.inf file:
protocols=32dlc"
<P>
This line should actually be protocols=MSDLC32.
<P>
Batch 2.0 included in the Service Pack will add the correct entry.
<P>
When installing the 32-bit DLC protocol into a server-based setup
installation, you will need to use  Netdlc32.sbs. Change to the directory
or network drive where you have copied the 32-bit DLC component, and then
delete or rename Netdlc32.inf. Then rename Netdlc32.sbs to Netdlc32.inf.
This is the INF you should then use with INFINST.
<P>
INFINST might ask for the location of Dlc.vxd during the installation. Just
<P>
accept the source path INFINST asks for and INFINST will continue to update
<P>
the Netsetup directory on the server.
<P>
Note
If you are using MSDLC32 in an environment where Windows 95 is running from
<P>
a network server, you might need to update Autoexec.bat. This will only
affect you if you are running 16-bit applications that need DLC.
<P>
To update Autoexec.bat

<OL><P><LI>Edit the Autoexec.bat file to ensure that Net.exe is loaded
   before Dlchlp.exe.

<P><LI>Check to see that the path for Dlchlp.exe is set for the shared
   directory on the network server you run Windows 95 from.
<P>
</OL>Example of correct Autoexec.bat text:
<P>
NET.EXE
G:\Netsetup\dlchlp.exe
<P>
<P>
If Setup fails during an installation of 32-bit DLC
<P>
After you install Windows 95 to a local hard disk from a server-based
installation of Windows 95, your computer may stop responding ("hang") when
<P>
Setup tries to restart the computer.
<P>
Possible Cause:
<P>
The Msbatch.inf file has Dial-Up Networking chosen, and MSDLC32 has been
added using Infinst.exe. The dial-up adapter does not bind to MSDLC32.
<P>
Resolution:
<P>
Add the following line to the [Network] section of the Msbatch.inf file:
<P>
RemoveBindings=msdlc32,*PNP8387
<P>
