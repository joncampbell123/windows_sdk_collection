The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 2.0, 2.1, 3.0, 3.01a for
   Macintosh
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article lists steps you can use to troubleshoot Microsoft Internet
Explorer for Macintosh.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Before You Start</h3>
 
<P>
Before you begin troubleshooting, ask yourself the following questions:

<UL><LI>Did Internet Explorer for Macintosh work before? If so, what has
   changed recently? For example, have you added new hardware or software?

<LI>What model is your Macintosh? Does it meet the requirements outlined
   in the release notes for your version of Internet Explorer?

<LI>What version of the operating system is installed?
<P>
</UL><h3>"Cold Boot" Your Computer</h3>
 
<P>
To "cold boot" your Macintosh, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI> Quit all running programs.

<P><LI> On the Special menu click Shut Down.
 
<P><PRE>    NOTE: Some Macintosh computers require you to turn off a switch,
    others will completely power down without further user intervention.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Wait for 30 seconds. 

<P><LI> Restart your Macintosh.
<P>
</OL><h3>Delete Cache Folder Files</h3>
 
<P>
If Internet Explorer will not start, but started correctly in the past,
one or more files in the cache folder may be damaged. When Internet
Explorer starts, it attempts to load the History.html file and initialize
the cache folder. If one or more of the files in the cache folder is
damaged, Internet Explorer may not start. To resolve this issue, delete all
of the files in the cache folder. With Internet Explorer 2.0 or 2.1, delete
the files in the System Folder:Preferences:Explorer:Cache folder.
With Internet Explorer 3.0, delete the files in the System
Folder:Preferences:Explorer:Explorer Cache folder. If a file cannot be
deleted, it may indicate that the file is in use or there is a system
problem. Try running Disk First Aid, or restart the computer with
extensions disabled (see the "Disable Control Panels, Extensions, and
Startup Items" section in this aritcle).
<P>
<P><h3>Disable Control Panels, Extensions, and Startup Items</h3>
 
<P>
Control Panels, extensions, and items in the Startup Items folder (such
as anti-virus software) may cause problems with Internet Explorer for
Macintosh. To disable these items, press and hold down SHIFT while the
computer starts. You should receive a message stating that the extensions
are disabled or off.
<P>
NOTE: This procedure disables network support. To perform a clean start
with networking, you must move extra Control Panels and extensions out of
the appropriate folders and restart.
<P>
<P><h3>Remove Items in the Plug-Ins Folder</h3>
 
<P>
Items in the Plug-Ins folder may prevent Internet Explorer for Macintosh
from functioning properly. With Internet Explorer 2.0 or 2.1, this folder
is located in the Internet Explorer 2.0 Folder. With Internet Explorer
3.0, the Plug-Ins folder is located in the Microsoft Internet
Applications:Internet Explorer 3.0 Folder. To test whether a plug-in is
causing the problem, move the items in the Plug-Ins folder to a temporary
folder. If the problem is resolved, move each item back into the Plug-
Ins folder one at a time and restart Internet Explorer each time until you
find the one causing the problem.
<P>
<P><h3>Reduce Screen Resolution and Color Depth</h3>
 
<P>
If your computer supports changing the video resolution and color depth,
reduce them by using the appropriate Control Panel.
<P>
<P><h3>Disable Features of Internet Explorer 2.0 or 2.1 for Macintosh</h3>
 
<P>
To disable specific features of Internet Explorer 2.0 or 2.1 for
troubleshooting purposes, click Options on the Edit menu and then disable
the features on the following tabs:

<UL><LI>Page&amp;Link: Disable the Media settings (Show Pictures, Play Sounds, and
   Show Video). These settings are resource intensive and may destabilize
   slower systems.

<LI>Display: Disable Show Tool Bar and Show Icon Animation. Animation
   depends on Apple's thread manager, which may not function smoothly on
   older computers.

<LI>Home/Search Page: Click Use None to set the Home Page to none.

<LI>Proxy: Make sure the proxy settings, which are usually in the form of
   Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, are correct.

<LI>Advanced: Empty the History cache, empty the Disk cache, and clear the
   Support Multiple Connections check box.

<LI>In the main Options window, clear the Use Internet Config Settings
   check box.
<P>
</UL><h3>Disable Features of Internet Explorer 3.0 for Macintosh</h3>
 
<P>
To disable specific features of Internet Explorer 3.0 for troubleshooting
purposes, click Preferences on the Edit menu, and then disable the features
on the following tabs:

<UL><LI>Browser Display: Disable Show Button Bar and Show Icon Animation in the
   Toolbar Settings section.

<LI>Web Content: Disable the Multimedia settings (Show Pictures, Play
   Sounds, Show Video) and Enhancements settings (Show Frames, Use Plug-
   Ins, Java, ActiveX Objects).

<LI>Home/Search Page: Click Use None to set the home page to None.

<LI>Proxy: If you are accessing the Internet through a proxy server (a
   server on a local area network that lets you connect to the Internet
   without using a modem), make sure that proxy is enabled and that the
   proxy settings (usually in the form of IP addresses) are correct.

<LI>Advanced: Click the Empty button in the Cache section to empty the disk
   cache.
<P>
</UL>If you are having problems running Java programs in Internet Explorer 3.0,
see the following articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../ie_app/q164388.htm">Q164388</A></B>
   TITLE     : Err Msg: There Is Not Enough Memory to Run the Java VM

   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../ie_app/q162743.htm">Q162743</A></B>
   TITLE     : Cannot Run Java Programs in Internet Explorer for Macintosh

</PRE></OL><h3>Remove the Preferences File</h3>
 
<P>
If you receive an error message when you start your computer, move the
Preferences folder from the System Folder to a temporary folder. A new
Preferences folder will be created when you restart the computer. If this
eliminates the error message, there was one or more corrupt files in the
Preferences folder. You may want to selectively restore preference files
for other programs from the original Preferences folder to the new
Preferences folder. You will have to move the PPP and TCP/IP preferences
files back into the new Preferences folder. Point to Point protocol
(PPP) and Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) function
only when the old Preferences file has been restored, or when a new file is
created by reconfiguring the settings. Unlike Internet Explorer 2.0 or 2.1,
Internet Explorer 3.0 stores its settings in the Internet Preferences
file in the System Folder:Preferences folder. This file is also used by
Internet Config, and may contain preferences used by other Internet-based
programs (mail programs, news readers, ftp programs, and so on). Do not
delete this file unless you are sure you have written down all of the
settings.
<P>
NOTE: If Netscape Navigator is installed, Internet Explorer for Macintosh
attempts to import Netscape's settings into its Preferences file. If those
settings are incorrect or damaged, they may prevent Internet Explorer from
functioning correctly.
<P>
<P><h3>Rebuild the Desktop File</h3>
 
<P>
A damaged Desktop file may be indicated by generic icons in the Finder
(desktop) and the inability to start programs. In addition, error messages
stating that a program has insufficient memory, or that the amount of
memory allocated to the program should be increased, may occur. You can
rebuild the Desktop file by pressing and holding down COMMAND+OPTION keys
while restarting the computer. Note that rebuilding the file may purge
inactive files and links but leave the damaged set of files. Tools are
available from online sources that force the Macintosh to re-create a
Desktop file series by deleting them entirely.
<P>
<P><h3>Switch to Open Transport or Classic Networking</h3>
 
<P>
If the problem seems to be related to connectivity, use the Network
Software Selector in the Apple Extras folder to enable Open Transport or
classic networking using MacTCP.
<P>
NOTE: MacTCP does not work on PCI PowerMacintosh computers.
<P>
<P><h3>Check for Viruses and Hard Disk Integrity</h3>
 
<P>
File system damage and viruses can prevent the installation and normal
operation of Internet Explorer for Macintosh. Use Disk First Aid (or a
similar disk maintenance tool such as Norton Disk Doctor or MacTools) to
verify the integrity of your hard disk. In addition, scan your hard disk
with an anti-virus tool to make sure your computer is not infected with a
virus.
<P>
<P><h3>Virtual Memory</h3>
 
<P>
In some cases, virtual memory can stabilize your computer. Use the Memory
icon in Control Panel to turn virtual memory on if it is off or to turn
virtual memory off if it is on.
<P>
<P><h3>Move Fonts from the Fonts Folder</h3>
 
<P>
Damaged fonts can cause problems in Internet Explorer. To see if this is
the case, move the fonts from the Fonts folder to a temporary folder.
<P>
<P><h3>Turn Off or Unplug External SCSI Devices</h3>
 
<P>
An incorrectly terminated small computer system interface (SCSI) chain may
cause programs to stop responding (hang), random error messages to appear,
or the system to indiscriminately crashes and restart. Turn off or unplug
external devices that are connected to the SCSI chain on the Macintosh.
<P>
Other reasons SCSI devices may not work or the chain may be unstable
include:

<UL><LI>One or more of the devices in the chain is not turned on.

<LI>Two or more of the devices have the same ID number.

<LI>The chain is improperly terminated.

<LI>The total chain (cable length) is too long (over 20 feet).

<LI>A driver is incompatible with the current operating system.

<LI>A device or another part of the chain is damaged in some way.
<P>
</UL>Because SCSI device drivers are loaded into memory when the Macintosh is
turned on, they can generate conflicts similar to extension conflicts. When
you are using a non-Apple formatting tool, contact the tool's manufacturer
for compatibility information. Removing internal SCSI devices is best
performed by an Apple-authorized service provider.
<P>
<P><h3>Update the Hard Disk Driver</h3>
 
<P>
If you have an Apple hard disk, update its driver to the most recent
version using Apple's HDSC program. This is valid for Apple drives only;
third-party drives may require their own drivers.
<P>
<P><h3>Reinstall the System Software</h3>
 
<P>
Reinstall the system software only if you continue to have problems
installing Internet Explorer for Macintosh. When you are prompted
whether to update the current system folder or to perform a clean install
into a new folder, choose to perform a clean install. If this procedure is
not followed, the Setup program simply updates the currently active system
folder, keeping the damaged files or settings.
<P>
For information about reinstalling the system software, see the Macintosh
system documentation or other printed information included with your
computer.
<P>
<P><h3>Zap the Parameter RAM (PRAM)</h3>
 
<P>
Zapping the Parameter RAM (PRAM) is one technique for solving various
system and program problems on a Macintosh. In some cases, the PRAM may
need to be zapped several times. Please note that performing this
procedure resets only the first 64 bytes of 256 bytes in the PRAM. Tools
are available from online sources that completely reset the PRAM.
<P>
For more information on how to zap the PRAM, please see the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>    ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../zmiscellaneous/q52156.htm">Q52156</A></B>
    TITLE     : How to "Zap" the Parameters (PRAM) of a Macintosh

</PRE><h3>Problems Printing</h3>
 
<P>
If you are experiencing a printing problem, try to print from an Apple text
editor (TeachText or SimpleText). If these programs print, the problem is
specific to Internet Explorer for Macintosh. If these programs do not
print, contact Apple or your printer manufacturer for further assistance.
<P>
<P><h3>Upgrade to the Latest Version of the Macintosh Operating System</h3>
 
<P>
If you are using Internet Explorer version 3.01a, some of the advanced
features of Internet Explorer may not be supported with earlier versions of
the Macintosh operating system. Even though Internet Explorer may install
additional components for earlier versions of the operating system (for
example, Drag Manager), the operating system itself may not contain
code necessary for Internet Explorer to run successfully. If this is the
case, a newer version of the operating system may be necessary.
<P>
<P><h3>Disable Caching</h3>
 
<P>
If you are using Internet Explorer version 3.01a on a Macintosh with a
68040 processor, try disabling the built-in processor cache. If the cache
becomes damaged, you may experience problems.
