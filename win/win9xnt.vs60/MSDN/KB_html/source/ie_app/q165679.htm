The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 3.0, 3.01, 3.02a for
   Windows 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After adding what appears to be a universal naming convention (UNC) path to
an .htm file in the list of favorites, you may not be able to access that
file using the Favorites menu after restarting Internet Explorer.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Windows 3.1 and Windows for Workgroups are not UNC-aware. The UNC
path name in the Favorites.htm file causes Internet Explorer to attempt to
resolve the UNC path name as a file name on the local computer.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Map a drive letter to a network resource prior to adding a file located
on that resource to the Favorites menu.
<P>
For information about mapping a drive, click Start, click Help, click the
Index tab, type "mapping network" (without quotation marks), and then
double-click the "mapping network drives" topic.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft is aware of this situation and will post more information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base when it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Internet Explorer locates a file initially (despite the fact that Windows
3.1 and Windows for Workgroups are not UNC-aware) by using the following
syntax:
<P>
<PRE>   file:\\&lt;server_name&gt;\&lt;file_name.htm&gt;

</PRE>If you then save the file as a favorite, restart Internet Explorer, and
attempt to access the file from the Favorites menu, you may receive the
following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   'file:c:\&lt;installation_directory&gt;\\\&lt;server_name&gt;\&lt;file_name.htm&gt;'
   could not be found.
   The attempt to load
   'file:c:\&lt;installation_directory&gt;\\\&lt;server_name&gt;\&lt;file_name.htm&gt;'
   failed.

</PRE>When Internet Explorer checks the Favorites.htm file in its installation
folder, it finds the entry that begins with "file:" and assumes that the
backslashes ("\\") are the first two characters in the file name. In
addition, it assumes that the file is located on the local drive.
<P>
When the file is not found, Internet Explorer modifies the entry to
include its installation folder followed by a backslash. It then adds what
it believes to be the file name, beginning with the two backslashes.
Because this is not an actual path, the error message is generated.
