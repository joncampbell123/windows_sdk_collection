<P>
DOWNLOAD INSTRUCTIONS FOR SERVICE PACK 1
 
The Microsoft Window 95 Service Pack 1 downloadable version is shipped in
compressed format. To extract you must run Admin.bat.  Admin.bat is
extracted in Step 3 below.
<P>
NOTE
<PRE>   - Do not run the individual "Diskx.exe" files, use the Admin.bat
     file.
   - Admin.doc, the Windows 95 Service Pack 1 Administrator Guide, is
     located in the \Admin folder on Disk 2.

   1. Create a new folder on your computer.
   2.  Click the file that you want to download. You must download all
      of the disks (Disks 1-13) to a folder on your computer. Save
      each to the same folder on your computer.
   3. Double-click Start.exe to extract the initial files.
   4.  Double-click Admin.bat (extracted in step 3 above) to extract
      Windows 95 Service Pack 1 to your computer.  By default
      Admin.bat will create a folder named C:\SP1 and extract Service
      Pack 1 to this folder. Optionally you may specify the name of
      the folder that you would like to extract Service Pack 1.

   To change the default installation folder from c:\Sp1 to another
   folder, start a MS-DOS prompt and type Admin.bat with the name of
   the folder that you downloaded the Service Pack 1 disks to and the
   folder you wish to use.

   Command line to change the default source and/or destination folder:

          Admin [x:\Srcdir y:\Destdir]

      examples:
          Admin a: c:\Temp\Sp1         ;from floppy to c: drive
          Admin c:\Destdir             ;from current dir to c:\Destdir
          Admin g:\User\Mydir          ;from g: to current dir
          Admin g:\User\Mydir          ;from g: to c:\Sp1

   If the source folder is not specified, it will first look in the
   current folder.  If the files are not found, Admin.bat will then
   ask which floppy disk drive to try.

   If you want to use the current folder for the source, but specify a
   custom destination directory, use "." for the source directory.

</PRE><h2>INSTALLING THE SERVICE PACK 1 UPDATE</h2>
 
NOTE: Do not install the Service Pack 1 Update English version on the
English Pan European version of Windows 95 or any other International
version of Windows 95.
<P>
<PRE>   1. Quit any applications that are currently running. If you use the
      Microsoft Plus! System Agent, right-click the System Agent icon
      on the toolbar, and then click Suspend System Agent.

   2. Insert the Windows 95 Service Pack 1 CD or Disk 1.

   3. Double-click Setup.exe, and then follow the instructions on your
      screen.

</PRE>NOTE
<PRE>   - Do not click Cancel during Setup; doing so might cause Setup to
     fail. This may be true even though a message is displayed stating
     that your system was updated successfully.
   - If you cancel Setup by mistake, run Setup again. If you are asked
     "Do you want to overwrite the file:" click Yes To All.

</PRE>When the Setup.exe program completes, your version of Windows 95
will be updated to version 4.00.950a.
