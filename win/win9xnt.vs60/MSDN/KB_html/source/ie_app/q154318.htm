The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Internet Mail and News version 1.0 for Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you receive a message with an attachment in WinCIM that was sent with
Internet Mail, you may receive an error message stating that the message
size is too large and that the message and attachment will be included in
one file (possibly named Mail.txt).
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is caused by the way CompuServe receives mail. The headers,
text, Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), attachments, and so on are all in
the text area of the message, resulting in a file size that may be too
large for WinCIM to handle.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This issue relates to how CompuServe and WinCIM handle mail with
attachments and not to the manner in which they are sent with Internet
Mail.
