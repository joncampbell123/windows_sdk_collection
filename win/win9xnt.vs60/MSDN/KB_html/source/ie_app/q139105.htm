The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 2.0, 3.0, 3.01, 3.02 for Windows
   95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you have the AutoDial (Internet Explorer 2.0) or "Connect to the 
Internet as needed" (Internet Explorer 3.x) feature enabled and you start 
Microsoft Internet Explorer, Internet Explorer may not automatically dial 
your Internet service provider. Because you are not connected to your 
service provider, the following error message may be displayed:
<P>
<PRE>   Unable to find &lt;Web site&gt;. The address may be incorrect.

</PRE>where &lt;Web site&gt; is the Internet address of your Start page.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior can occur when you switch from using a proxy server (a 
server on a local area network that lets you connect to the Internet 
without using a modem) or other local area network (LAN)-based connection, 
to having Internet Explorer automatically dial your Internet service 
provider (ISP). After you configure Internet Explorer to use the AutoDial 
or "Connect to the Internet as needed" feature, your current Start page 
may still be the Start page that you were using with a proxy server or 
other LAN-based connection. If Internet Explorer does not need to connect 
to your Internet service provider to access your Start page, it does not 
automatically dial. Your Internet service provider is automatically dialed 
only when you attempt to access a Web site that Internet Explorer cannot 
access without first dialing your provider.
<P>
The error message may be displayed when your Start page is one that is 
normally accessed using a proxy server or other LAN-based connection, but 
is currently not available.
<P>
NOTE: It is possible for the behavior described in this article to occur
even if you have never configured Internet Explorer to connect to the
Internet using a proxy server or other LAN-based connection. This
behavior can also occur when your current Start page is a Web site that
Internet Explorer cannot access without first dialing your Internet 
service provider. The resolution described in this article resolves this 
behavior in these cases.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To cause Internet Explorer to automatically dial your Internet service 
provider, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click Start, point to Programs, point to Accessories, and then click
   Dial-Up Networking.

<P><LI>Double-click the connection you use to dial the Internet, and then
   log on as you normally do. If you do not know which connection to
   use, then use the right mouse button to click The Internet icon on
   the desktop, click Properties, and then see which connection is listed
   in the Dial-Up Networking box (this information is on the Connection
   tab in Internet Explorer 3.x)

<P><LI>After you start the Dial-Up Networking connection, start Internet
   Explorer.

<P><LI>Empty the temporary file cache. To do so, click Options on the View
   menu, click the Advanced tab, click Settings, click Empty Folder, click
   Yes, click OK, and then click OK again.

<P><LI>Type the Internet address of the Web site you want to use as your Start
   page in the Address box, and then press the ENTER key. Perform this
   step even if the site you want to use is already listed in the Address
   box.

<P><LI>If the address you want to use did not appear in the Address box when
   you started Internet Explorer, click Options on the View menu, click
   the Start And Search Pages tab, and then click Use Current (this
   information is on the Navigation tab in Internet Explorer 3.x).

<P><LI>Quit Internet Explorer and the Dial-Up Networking connection, and
   then restart Internet Explorer.
<P></OL>
