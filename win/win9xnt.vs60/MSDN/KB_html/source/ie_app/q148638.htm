<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how to configure Dial-Up Networking to redial the
specified phone number if a connection is not established (such as when
the line is busy or there is no answer) or if a connection is established,
but then disrupted.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To configure Dial-Up Networking to redial a phone number if no connection
is established or the connection is disrupted, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Programs, point to Accessories,
   and then click Dial-Up Networking.

<P><LI>On the Connections menu, click Settings.

<P><LI>Click the Redial check box to select it.

<P><LI>In the Before Giving Up Retry box, select the number of times you
   want Dial-Up Networking to redial the phone number before giving up.
   The default value is 1 and the maximum value is 100.

<P><LI>In the Between Tries Wait boxes, select the number of minutes and
   seconds you want Dial-Up Networking to wait between attempts to
   connect. The default values are 0 minutes and 0 seconds, and the
   maximum values are 119 minutes and 59 seconds.

<P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
</OL>Note that the Redial feature does not function in conjunction with the
AutoDial feature in Microsoft Internet Explorer. If you enable both
features and then attempt to connect to your Internet service provider by
double-clicking the Internet icon on the desktop, Dial-Up Networking does
not redial your Internet service provider if the connection is not
established. To use the Redial feature of Dial-Up Networking with Internet
Explorer, use the appropriate Dial-Up Networking connectoid to establish
the connection to your Internet service provider before starting Internet
Explorer. To do so, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Programs, point to Accessories, and
   then click Dial-Up Networking.

<P><LI>Double-click the connectoid used to connect to your Internet service
   provider, enter your user name and password, and then click Connect.

<P><LI>After the connection to your Internet service provider has been
   established, start Internet Explorer by double-clicking the Internet
   icon on the desktop.
<P></OL>
