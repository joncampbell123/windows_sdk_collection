<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article contains a copy of the information in the Read Me (MSPWS 4.0)
file included with Personal Web Server 4.0 for Macintosh.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft(r) Personal Web Server for Macintosh(r) 4.0
<P>
 
<P><h3>Welcome</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft Personal Web Server is a full-featured Web server designed to
run in the background on your desktop Macintosh. Best of all, it's easy to
use! Everything you need to monitor your Web site and personalize your
home page is available from the Microsoft Personal Web Manager. In
addition, as owner of the Web server, you can use the site administration
tools available when you view your home page from Internet Explorer. These
tools let you do things such as read messages, and browse and retrieve
files from your disk. If you don't know HTML, don't worry. Microsoft
Personal Web Server will automatically convert SimpleText documents.
<P>
 
<P><h3>What's New</h3>
 
<P>
- Improved Web Site: The new documents in the "My Personal Web Site"
folder provide a more attractive Web site and add extra links, including
a link to a shared documents folder.
- Easier to Use: The user interface has had a major overhaul to make it
more powerful and easier to use. 
- More Powerful Active Server Pages (ASP): Looping constructs have been
added to ASP to give it a broader range of capabilities. You can also now
include entire scripts within a single set of delimiters. Complete
documentation of ASP is included in the Personal Web Server Help.
<P>
 
<P><h3>Requirements</h3>
 
<P>
System Requirements
- 68030 processor or better 
- System 7.1 and above 
- 1400K of available RAM
- 7.1 MB of hard disk space to install
- 4.6 MB of hard disk space to run, including the contents of the My
Personal Web Site folder as initially installed
<P>
Access to the Internet
You must have access to the Internet through an Internet service provider
or the network to which your computer is connected. To take full advantage
of Personal Web Server, you must also have a static IP address or domain
name.
<P>
Internet Software
- MacTCP (control panel) or Open Transport 1.08 or greater (extension)
with TCP/IP (control panel)
- If you are a dial-up user, Config PPP or similar PPP connection software
(control panel) with PPP (extension) 
<P>
 
<P><h3>Help</h3>
 
<P>
For help with Microsoft Personal Web Server for Macintosh, open the
Personal Web Manager control panel and choose Personal Web Server Help
from the Help menu. 
<P>
 
<P><h3>Installation Note: The My Personal Web Site Folder</h3>
 
<P>
The Personal Web Server Installer places documents in the My Personal Web
Site folder that make it easy to get your first Web site up and running.
This folder is normally installed in the top-level directory of your
startup disk. If there is already a folder named "My Personal Web Site" in
that location, you may want to remove or rename it before running the
installer. Otherwise, the installer will not automatically update it, but
will instead create a Personal Web Site Files 4.0 folder in the Personal
Web Server folder inside the Microsoft Internet Applications folder.
<P>
 
<P><h3>Technical Support</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft offers technical support and services ranging from self-help
tools to direct assistance with a Microsoft technical engineer. For more
information on options in your area, read the file Support.txt in the Help
folder (located in the Personal Web Server folder inside the Microsoft
Internet Applications folder).
<P>
 
<P><h3>Reporting Problems/Suggestions</h3>
 
<P>
To report problems, send mail to PWSMBugs@microsoft.com.
<P>
Please include: 
- The version of Personal Web Server you are using
- What version you upgraded from
- System configuration information
- Version of operating system 
- Type of Macintosh 
- Type of connection to the Internet 
- Steps that lead to the problem. For example:
<PRE>      1. Open the Microsoft Personal Web Manager.
      2. Click the Links button.
      3. Add links to your home page.
      4. View your home page and no links appear.
</PRE>- Any other information that will help us reproduce the problem
successfully.
<P>
 
<P><h3>Accessing Your Web Site</h3>
 
<P>
Your Web site can be accessed with any browser. However, when you, and
visitors to your Web site, use Internet Explorer, your Web pages will look
their best.  Internet Explorer lets you take advantage of some of the
latest HTML features such as style sheets and frames. For more information
on HTML, visit <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/workshop/author/newhtml">http://www.microsoft.com/workshop/author/newhtml,</A></B> or to
download a free copy of Internet Explorer for the Macintosh, visit
<B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/ie/mac">http://www.microsoft.com/ie/mac.</A></B>
<P>
 
<P><h3>Known Limitations</h3>
 
<P>
Due to changes in Active Server Pages, many of the files in the 1.0
version of My Personal Web Site will not work properly with Personal Web
Server 4.0. 
<P>
Slash ("/") not permitted in hard disk, file, or folder names: The slash
character is used in URLs to separate folders in a path. If this character
is included within a published disk, file, or folder name, Personal Web
Server will misinterpret the name and will be unable to serve up the item
or any files or folders it contains.
<P>
Under MacTCP, dial-up PPP connections may not be initiated: With some PPP
programs under MacTCP, Personal Web Server may fail to initiate a dial-up
connection. If you experience this problem, you must manually establish
the dial-up PPP connection before turning Web publishing on. Once the
connection is established, Personal Web Server should function properly
<P>
JIS encoding in HTML documents: HTML documents encoded with the JIS
character set may not display properly when served up by Personal Web
Server because Personal Web Server removes all occurrences of "&lt;%" when
processing HTML for Active Server Pages tags. To prevent Personal Web
Server from processing JIS encoded HTML documents, use the ".jis" file
extension instead of ".html".
<P>
FTP Plug-in may be slow on 68K computers: On 68K computers, the FTP Plug-
in may be slow to respond when the client does not have permission to
access the requested item. When this happens the 68K computer running
Personal Web Server may not respond to user input for up to 15 seconds
<P>
Personal Web Server supports fewer connections on a 68K Macintosh: Because
of memory limitations, Personal Web Server supports fewer connections on
68K computers.
<P>
When using the W*API Adapter Plug-in and certain W*API plug-ins on 68K
Macintosh computers, stopping the server may cause a crash. The W*API
version of CountWWWebula is known to exhibit this problem. A MOS plug-in
version of CountWWWeblua is available and will not cause this crash.
<P>
 
<P><h3>Access Control for Files on Remote Volumes</h3>
 
<P>
You can use Microsoft Personal Web Server to publish files on remote
volumes. However, Personal Web Server does not use the file sharing
privileges that apply to the remote volume. 
<P>
To restrict access to files on a remote volume:
1. Turn on "Restrict access to Web site" in the the Advanced panel of the
Microsoft Personal Web Manager.
2. Set the file sharing privileges for a local folder on your site.
3. Mount the remote volume and select a file or folder on that volume that
you want to publish.
4. Make sure that the file sharing privileges for the selected file or
folder have the "See Files" option checked for "Everyone."
5. Create an alias to the file or folder and copy the alias into the local
folder whose file sharing privileges you set previously.
This will restrict access to the remote file for folder to users who have
permission to access to the local folder that contains the alias.
<P>
Note: If you do not want to restrict access to the items on the remote
volume, turn "Restrict access to Web site" off or make sure that "See
Files" option is checked for "Everyone."
