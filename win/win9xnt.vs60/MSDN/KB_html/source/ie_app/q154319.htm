The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Internet Mail and News version 1.0 for Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you receive partial messages that were sent from Internet Mail, you
may experience any of the following symptoms:

<UL><LI>When you download mail in Microsoft Exchange, all the parts are
   received but not combined into the original message. In addition, the
   contents of each mail message, marked as "[1 of 2]" and so on, are
   attachments with the extension .att.

<LI>When you download mail in CompuServe, all parts of the message may be
   received but not combined or labeled.

<LI>When you download mail in EudoraPro 32, the following error message is
   generated:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Cannot display message:  Copy (read) error.
</PRE><P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Some Internet service providers are not equipped to handle partial
messages.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Do not send partial messages to recipients who use one of the service
providers or mail clients listed above.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Some gateways or Simple Mail Transport Protocol (SMTP) servers reject
messages that are too large. Therefore, options to break apart messages
over a certain size are needed. Internet Mail can send large messages as
separate messages to be reassembled, rather than as one large message.
