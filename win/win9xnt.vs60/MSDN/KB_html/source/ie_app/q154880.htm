The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Internet Mail and News version 1.0 for Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes the Setup process and lists steps to troubleshoot
problems you may encounter when you set up Internet Mail and News.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
You can set up Internet Mail and News by double-clicking the Mailnews.exe
file, or by installing the typical (Msie301r.exe) or full (Msie301mnt.exe)
release of Microsoft Internet Explorer version 3.01. This extracts the
Setup files to a temporary folder in your TEMP folder and runs the
installation program. The temporary folder is named Mse&lt;xxxx&gt;.tmp, where
&lt;xxxx&gt; is a randomly generated number. This folder is deleted when the
installation is finished, along with any files that are used only for the
installation process.
<P>
The following files are added during installation:
<P>
<PRE>   Windows\Help folder:

      Mailnews.cnt    6,675
      Mailnews.hlp    129,243
      Wab.cnt         309
      Wab.hlp         25,558

   Windows\Inf folder:

      Mailnews.inf    16,633

   Windows\System folder:

      Cp_20866.nls    6,824
      Cp_28592.nls    5,416
      Cp_28593.nls    5,448
      Cp_28594.nls    5,448
      Cp_28597.nls    5,320
      Gapia32.dll     83,552
      Htmledit.dll    228,624
      Imnimp.dll      43,152
      Mailnews.dll    1,148,176
      Mailnews.txt    12,929
      Wab32.dll       205,072
      Wabmig.exe      18,944

</PRE>The W95inf16.dll, W95inf32.dll, Advpack.dll, and _isetup.exe files are
used only during installation and are deleted along with the temporary
folder when installation is finished.
<P>
NOTE: In the updated version of Internet Mail and News, the following
files are also installed:
<P>
<PRE>   Windows folder:

      Wab.exe         14,768

   Windows\System folder:

      Wldap32.dll     48,208
      Wabfind.dll     10,368
      Wabimp.dll      35,760

   The following files are updated:

      Wabmig.exe      38,864
      Mailnews.txt    12,177
      Mailnews.inf    21,417
      Mailnews.dll    1,190,912
      Imnimp.dll      41,984
      Htmledit.dll    226,816
      Wab32.dll       357,648
      Wab.cnt         1,180
      Wab.hlp         49,167
      Mailnews.cnt    6,542

</PRE>When the file copy process is finished, you may be prompted to restart the
computer. During the restart process, the Wininit.ini file is processed to
replace files that were in use at the time of installation. The RunOnce
registry key is also processed and Grpconv.exe is run to update the
shortcuts in the Start menu.
