INSTALLING PC CARD (PCMCIA) MODEMS
USING A LOCAL AREA NETWORK PROXY OR FIREWALL
USING PROGRESSIVE NETWORKS' REALAUDIO SUPPORT
USING INTERNET EXPLORER WITH VIRTUAL MEMORY
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>INSTALLING PC CARD (PCMCIA) MODEMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you are using a PC card (PCMCIA) modem for your Dial-up Networking
connection to the Internet and have not yet installed the modem,
you may have to enable Windows 95 PC card socket support before
running the Internet Setup wizard.
<P>
To enable PCMCIA socket support:

<OL><P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click
   Control Panel.

<P><LI>Double-click the PC Card (PCMCIA) icon to start the PC Card
   Wizard, and then follow the instructions on your screen.
<P>
   NOTE: If you can't find the PC Card icon, you may need to install
<PRE>         the PC card (PCMCIA) drivers. To do this, double-click the
         Add New Hardware icon, click No, click PCMCIA Support from
         the list of hardware items, and then follow the instructions
         on your screen.


</PRE></OL><h2>USING A LOCAL AREA NETWORK PROXY OR FIREWALL</h2>
 
<P>
If you want to use a proxy or firewall to protect your Local Area
Network from being accessed by other on the Internet, follow these
steps:

<OL><P><LI>Run the Internet Setup Wizard.
<P>
   You can run the wizard after by clicking the Start button,
   pointing to Programs, then pointing to Accessories, then
   pointing to Internet Tools, and then double-clicking
   Internet Setup Wizard.

<P><LI>Configure your computer to connect to the Internet by using TCP/IP
   on on your local area network.

<P><LI>When asked for the gateway address, type the address supplied by
   your network administrator only if your organization uses gateways
   for routing information over the network.
<P>
   NOTE: The gateway computer is not the same as the proxy or firewall
   computer which protects your local area network from the Internet,
   so do not type your proxy or firewall address here.

<P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Control
   Panel.

<P><LI>Click the Internet icon, and then click the Advanced tab.

<P><LI>Make sure the Use Proxy Server box is checked.

<P><LI>Type the http server address and the port number for the computer
   you want to use as the proxy server in the Proxy Server box. The
   following is an example of a proxy server address and port number:
<P>
<P><PRE>      <B>http://myproxy.mycompany.com:80</B>
</PRE><P>
   In the Bypass Proxy On box, type the names of the computers,
   domains, and ports on the Internet that, when accessed, will
   not go through the proxy server. Separate each item you type
   with a comma.
<P>
   If you do not know what to type in the Proxy Server, or Bypass
   Proxy On boxes, see your network administrator. For Help on these
   items, click the ? in the title bar, and then click the item.
<P>
<P>
</OL><h2>USING PROGRESSIVE NETWORKS' REALAUDIO SUPPORT</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Internet Explorer includes support for Progressive Networks'
RealAudio. This enables you to listen to audio files in real time over
a dial-up modem or direct-network Internet connection. To use
RealAudio, you must have a Windows 95-supported sound card installed
in your computer. RealAudio works best on 486/33 or faster processors.
<P>
To try RealAudio, connect to <B><A href="http://www.realaudio.com">http://www.realaudio.com.</A></B>
<P>
NOTE: RealAudio will not work if your connection is routed through
<PRE>      a local area network proxy or firewall.


</PRE></OL><h2>USING INTERNET EXPLORER WITH VIRTUAL MEMORY</h2>
 
<P>
Internet Explorer requires you to use virtual memory. Otherwise,
Internet Explorer will not run properly. To make sure you are using
virtual memory:

<OL><P><LI>Click the Start button, then point to Settings, and then click
   Control Panel.

<P><LI>Double-click the System icon, and then click the Performance tab.

<P><LI>Click the Virtual Memory button.

<P><LI>If you are specifying your own virtual memory settings, make
   sure the Disable Virtual Memory box is unchecked. If this box
   is checked, then you are not using virtual memory and Internet
   Explorer won't run.
<P>
   TIP: You can let Windows manage virtual memory for you by
<PRE>        selecting the Let Windows Manage My Virtual Memory
        Settings option.
