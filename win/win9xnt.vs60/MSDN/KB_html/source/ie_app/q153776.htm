The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 2.0, 3.0, 3.01, 3.02 for
   Windows 95
<LI>Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 3.0, 3.01, 3.02a for
   Windows 3.1
</UL>

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you save a Web page from its original location to your hard disk,
pictures that appeared on the original page may not appear when you open
the copy of the page on your hard disk. In addition, sounds and videos
that were played when you opened the original page may not be played when
you open the copy of the page on your hard disk.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When you save a Web page to your hard disk, Internet Explorer saves the
Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) file associated with the page, but it does
Not save supplementary files such as pictures, sounds, and videos.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this behavior, manually save any pictures or videos that
you want to appear when you open the Web page on your hard disk. You should
store the pictures and videos in the same folder that contains the
HTML file associated with the Web page. To save a picture or video that
appears on a Web page to your hard disk, use the right mouse button to
click (right-click) the picture or video, and then click Save Picture As on
the shortcut menu that appears.
<P>
NOTE: Sounds that are played automatically when you open a Web page cannot
be saved to your hard disk manually. However, the file associated with a
sound is usually saved in your Internet cache automatically. If you want
the sound to be played when you open the copy of the Web page on your hard
disk, copy the sound file from the cache to the folder that contains the
HTML file associated with the Web page. To do this, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click Start, point to Find, and then click Files or Folders.

<P><LI>In the Named box, type the name of the sound file you want, and then
   click Find Now.

<P><LI>In the list of found files, right-click the sound file, and then
   click Copy.

<P><LI>In Windows Explorer, right-click the folder that contains the HTML file
   associated with the Web page, and then click Paste on the shortcut menu.
<P>
</OL>In addition to pictures or videos that appear when you open the Web page,
you may want to save pictures, sounds, or videos that appear or are played
when you click an object on the Web page. To do so, right-click the object
associated with the picture, sound, or video, and then click Save Target As
on the shortcut menu.
