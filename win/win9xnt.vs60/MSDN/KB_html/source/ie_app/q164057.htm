<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article contains a copy of the information in the Read Me (MSPWS 1.0)
file included with Microsoft Personal Web Server 1.0 for Macintosh. Setup
copies this file to the folder in which you install Personal Web Server.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft(r) Personal Web Server for Macintosh(r)
<P>
Welcome!
<P>
Microsoft Personal Web Server is a full-featured Web server designed to run
in the background on your desktop Macintosh. Best of all, it's easy to use!
Everything you need to monitor your Web site and personalize your home page
is available from the Microsoft Personal Web Server control panel. In
addition, as owner of the Web server, you can use the site administration
tools available when you view your home page from Internet Explorer. These
tools let you do things such as read messages, and browse and retrieve
files from your disk. If you don't know HTML, don't worry. Microsoft
Personal Web Server will automatically convert SimpleText documents.
<P>
<P><h3>Requirements</h3>
 
<P>
- Macintosh (68030 or 68040), Power Macintosh, or comparable MacOS
compatible computer with at least 8 megabytes of memory (RAM) installed.
- 1.2 MB of available memory (RAM).
- MacOS System 7.1 or later.
- 2 MB of hard disk space.
<P>
If you have a 68k Macintosh:
<P>
- If you are running less than System 7.5 on a 68k machine, you'll need
Thread Manager 2.0 (the installer will automatically place this in the
Extensions folder in your System folder)
<P>
Access to the Internet:
<P>
You must have access to the Internet through an Internet service provider
or the network to which your computer is connected. To take full advantage
of Personal Web Server, you must also have a static IP address or domain
name.
<P>
Internet Software:
<P>
- MacTCP (Control Panel)
If you are a dial-up user, Config PPP connection software (Control Panel)
with PPP (Extension)
or
- OpenTransport 1.08 (we strongly recommend OpenTransport 1.1.1)
(Extension)
If you are a dial-up user, OT/PPP
<P>

<P><h3>Help</h3>
 
<P>
For help with Microsoft Personal Web Server for Macintosh, open the
Microsoft Personal Web Server control panel and choose Personal Web Server
Help... from the "?" menu. (To see the "?" menu, click the "?" icon in the
menu bar at the top of the Macintosh screen.)
<P>
<P><h3>Technical Support</h3>
 
<P>

(905) 568-4494 in Canada. This support is free of charge, except for the
cost of the telephone call.
<P>
<P><h3>Registering Microsoft Personal Web Server 1.0 for Macintosh</h3>
 
<P>
Register Microsoft Personal Web Server 1.0 free of charge at
<B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/ie/ie_reg.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/ie/ie_reg.htm.</A></B> If you still have beta copies of
Microsoft Personal Web Server for Macintosh, discontinue using them at this
time.
<P>
For more information, see the License Agreement document in the Personal
Web Server folder.
<P>
<P><h3>Using Internet Explorer to Access Microsoft Personal Web Server Locally</h3>
 
<P>
Even when your Macintosh is not actively connected to a network, you can
use Internet Explorer to access Personal Web Server. To do this, make sure
Web publishing is turned on in the Personal Web Server control panel and
use Internet Explorer to access your site using the same URLs you use when
you are actively connected to the network.
<P>
Note: Personal Web Server is designed for use with Internet Explorer.
Accessing Personal Web Server locally has not been tested with other
browsers.
<P>
<P><h3>Active Server Pages</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft Personal Web Server for Macintosh supports a subset of the Active
Server Pages functionality available with Internet Information Server.
Personal Web Server treats all files with ".asp", ".html", and ".htm"
extensions as Active Server Pages. In most cases, this will not have any
effect on documents that do not contain Active Server Pages tags. However,
you can prevent Personal Web Server from processing an HTML document by
using the ".np" ("not processed") file extension instead of ".html". For
more information on using Active Server Pages with Microsoft Personal Web
Server for Macintosh, open the Microsoft Personal Web Server control panel
and then choose Microsoft Personal Web Server Help from the "?" menu. (To
see the "?" menu, click the "?" icon in the menu bar at the top of the
Macintosh screen.)
<P>
Note: The ASP syntax has been modified and finalized since the beta release
of PWS. Some of the tags used in the default documents in the beta version
of the My Personal Web Site folder may continue to work with Personal Web
Server 1.0. However, this syntax may not be supported in future versions.
<P>
<P><h3>Internet Config</h3>
 
<P>
If Internet Config is available, Microsoft Personal Web Server for
Macintosh will use Internet Config MIME mappings. To ensure that PWS serves
documents properly, a few basic mappings do not rely on the settings in
Internet Config.
<P>
W*API(tm) Support
 
<P>
Microsoft Personal Web Server for Macintosh includes a beta version of the
W*API(tm) Adapter Plug-in. With this plug-in installed, PWS will support
W*API(tm) plug-ins, as well as MOSAPI plug-ins. The W*API(tm) Adapter Plug-
in supports W*API(tm) 1.1.
<P>
To use the W*API(tm) Adapter Plug-in:
1. Drag the W*API(tm) Adapter Plug-in icon into the Server Plug-ins folder.
(Server Plug-ins is located in the PWS folder in MS Internet inside your
System Folder. There should also be an alias to Server Plug-ins in the
Personal Web Server folder.)
2. Drag any W*API(tm) plug-in icon into the Server Plug-ins folder.
3. Stop and restart publishing in the Microsoft Personal Web Server control
panel.
4. To configure a W*API(tm) plug-in, follow the instructions accompanying
it.
<P>
Note: Because of differences between Microsoft Personal Web Server and
WebStar(r), some W*API(tm) plug-ins may not work properly with Microsoft
Personal Web Server.
<P>
<P><h3>My Personal Web Site</h3>
 
<P>
The documents that Personal Web Server Installer places in the My Personal
Web Site folder make it easy to get your first Web site up and running.
These documents use Active Server Pages to create a dynamic home page,
including a simple message area and guestbook. To learn more about Active
Server Pages, refer to Personal Web Server Help.
<P>
Note: If you already have a beta version of the My Personal Web Site folder
when you run the 1.0 version of Personal Web Server Installer, the
installer places updated versions of these documents in a Personal Web Site
Files 1.0 folder in the Personal Web Server subfolder in the Microsoft
Internet Applications folder.
<P>
<P><h3>CGI and AppleEvent Support</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft Personal Web Server for Macintosh 1.0 has improved support for
AppleEvents and CGIs.
- PWS now supports AppleEvents to control the server from a remote
application.
- CGIs can now register themselves as action CGIs. The supported actions
are Preprocessor, Postprocessor, and Normal.
- Remote applications can now register themselves with the server to
receive request logging information and server status information.
<P>
<P><h3>Common Questions and Answers about URLs</h3>
 
<P>
Why is my URL a number rather than a name? Domain names are provided by
special servers known as Domain Name Servers (DNS). When Personal Web
Server starts up, it checks a DNS server to see if your computer has a
name. If the DNS server provides a valid name for your computer, the
Microsoft Personal Web Server control panel displays this name in your URL.
Otherwise, your URL contains your computer's IP address. Personal Web
Server may also show your IP address if your domain name is too long to be
displayed in its control panel.
<P>
Note: Sometimes a DNS will provide inaccurate information, preventing
Personal Web Server from displaying your computer's domain name, even
though one exists. In these cases, typing the domain name into a browser
will still work, even though the control panel shows only the IP address.
<P>
Why does my URL change every time I start Personal Web Server? Some
networks are configured to give your Macintosh a new IP address every time
you connect to the network. Since your URL is based on your computer's
address, your URL changes too. Your Internet provider may be able to
provide you with a static IP address or domain name to remedy this problem.
<P>
<P><h3>Controlling Access to Your Web Site</h3>
 
<P>
Personal Web Server only allows users to access the folder selected in the
Microsoft Personal Web Server control panel. (Unless you select a different
folder, this is My Personal Web Site.)
<P>
Owner privileges: As the owner of the Macintosh, you can access files
outside of the selected folder, by checking "Allow owner to browse disks"
in the control panel. With this option on, the owner name and password in
the Sharing Setup control panel will allow you to access all the files on
your computer. The owner name and password also give you access to the
"Site Administration" link in the default home page.
<P>
Restricting access: To restrict access to your Web site, you must assign
MacOS Personal File Sharing privileges to your Web site folder, turn file
sharing on, and check the "Use Access Control" option in the Microsoft
Personal Web Server control panel. Once access control is enabled, you can
restrict access to any folder on your site using the See Files checkboxes
in the file sharing privileges window for that folder.
<P>
Notes:
- To open the sharing privileges window for a given folder, select the
folder in the Finder and choose Sharing... from the File menu.
- To change the privileges in the sharing privileges window, you have to
check the "Share this item and its contents" option near the top of that
window. Once you have set the privileges you may turn this option off. This
option does not affect access to your Web site.
- The See Folders and Make Changes checkboxes in the sharing privileges
window do not affect access to your Web site.
<P>
Guest access: Even if you restrict access to your site, you may still allow
guests to access specific folders on your site. To allow guests access to a
folder, check the See Files checkbox for Everyone in the folder's sharing
privileges window.
<P>
<P><h3>Known Problems with Microsoft Personal Web Server 1.0</h3>
 
<P>
Slash ("/") not permitted in hard disk, file, or folder names: The slash
character is used in URLs to separate folders in a path. If this character
is included within a published disk, file, or folder name, Personal Web
Server will misinterpret the name and will be unable to serve up the item
or any files or folders it contains.
<P>
Under MacTCP, dial-up PPP connections may not be initiated: With some PPP
programs under MacTCP, Personal Web Server may fail to initiate a dial-up
connection. If you experience this problem, manually establish the dial-up
PPP connection before turning Web publishing on. Once the connection is
established, Personal Web Server should function properly.
<P>
JIS encoding in HTML documents: HTML documents encoded with the JIS
character set may not display properly when served up by Personal Web
Server because Personal Web Server removes all occurrences of "&lt;%" when
processing HTML for Active Server Pages tags. To prevent Personal Web
Server from processing JIS encoded HTML documents, use the ".jis" file
extension instead of ".html".
<P>
FTP Plug-in may be slow on 68K computers: On 68K computers, the FTP Plug-in
may be slow to respond when the client does not have permission to access
the requested item. When this happens the 68K computer running Personal Web
Server may not respond to user input for up to 15 seconds.
<P>
Personal Web Server may not have enough memory for certain plug-ins:
Because Personal Web Server uses very little memory (RAM), it may not have
enough memory available to run certain plug-ins. Every plug-in you place in
the Server Plug-ins folder uses some of the memory available to Personal
Web Server.
<P>
My Personal Web Site from Microsoft Personal Web Server 1.0b1: Due to
changes in the Active Server Pages syntax, the message and guestbook links
on the home page included with Personal Web Server 1.0b1 no longer work
with Personal Web Server 1.0 and the home page may display extra content.
<P>
Personal Web Server supports fewer connections on a 68K Macintosh: Because
of memory limitations, Personal Web Server supports fewer connections on
68K computers.
<P>
<P><h3>Upgrading from Microsoft Personal Web Server 1.0b1</h3>
 
<P>
The documents in the My Personal Web Site folder have been updated. If you
have the beta version of this folder, the Personal Web Server Installer
does not automatically update it, but it places the updated versions in a
Personal Web Site Files 1.0 folder in the Personal Web Server subfolder in
the Microsoft Internet Applications folder. You can either replace or
manually update the older versions of these documents. Note that the Active
Server Pages tags are significantly different in the new version. Note that
the names of several of these documents have been modified by replacing the
".htm" extension with ".asp".
<P>
Major Changes since 1.0b1
<P>
FTP Plug-in fixes: The FTP Plug-in now works on 68K and PPC Macintosh
computers. Other problems have also been resolved, including access control
and FTP client compatibility issues.
<P>
Active Server Pages: The syntax of the Personal Web Server Active Server
Pages implementation has been changed to make it more compatible with
Internet Information Server. Active Server Pages are now documented in
Personal Web Server Help.
<P>
CGI, AppleEvent, and MOS Plug-in support: Personal Web Server CGI and MOS
plug-in support has been enhanced to support a broader range of third party
server extensions.
<P>
W*API(tm) plug-in support: Personal Web Server now ships with a beta
version of the W*API(tm) Adapter Plug-in that allows Personal Web Server to
use W*API(tm) plug-ins.
<P>
Log format: The Personal Web Server Log format now places the date and time
in separate fields.
<P>
My Personal Web Site: The contents of the My Personal Web Site folder have
been updated to use the new Active Server Pages syntax. Files that use
Active Server Pages are now identified by the ".asp" file extension.
(Because of these changes, several tags supported in Personal Web Server
1.0b1 may not work properly in 1.0.)
<P>
<P><h3>Attention Web for One(tm) users!</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft Personal Web Server is similar to Web for One, but has some
important differences. Because of these differences, Web for One users will
have to manually switch to Microsoft Personal Web Server. This document
explains the differences between the two servers and provides instructions
for switching from Web for One to Microsoft Personal Web Server.
<P>
Changes:
- Improved Performance: Microsoft Personal Web Server has notable speed
improvements over Web for One. (This performance enhancement was achieved
with a small increase in the memory used by the Web server-it still uses
close to one megabyte of RAM.)
<P>
- MOS Plug-in Support: Personal Web Server supports MOS plug-ins. To
install a MOS plug-in, drop the plug-in into the Server Plug-ins folder.
This folder is located in the PWS folder in MS Internet inside your
System folder. To make installing plug-ins easy, the installer places an
alias to the Server Plug-ins folder in the Personal Web Server folder.
<P>
- Active Server Pages: Active Server Pages (ASP) allows you to create
dynamic Web pages and forms using a scripting language based on VBScript.
The ASP syntax replaces the syntax used by Web for One for server
includes and form processing. Because Microsoft Personal Web Server does
not support the Web for One server include or form processing syntax, all
pages using that syntax will have to be updated. (This version of
Microsoft Personal Web Server for Macintosh does not support the full ASP
scripting language, but does provide equivalent functionality to the
server includes and form processing syntax used in Web for One.)
<P>
- The default pages installed by Web for One contain old versions of the
<PRE>'server include' and 'form processing' syntax. The Microsoft Personal Web
</PRE>Server installer places updated versions of these documents in a new Web
site folder, called My Personal Web Site. If you made changes to the
original default pages, you will have to manually update these pages
again.
<P>
- Preferences: Microsoft Personal Web Server will not retain your previous
Web for One settings. Please use the Microsoft Personal Web Server control
panel to configure your Web server again.
<P>
Switching from Web for One to Microsoft Personal Web Server:
<P>
If you have been using Web for One, you will have to make a number of
changes to begin using Microsoft Personal Web Server.
<P>
To switch from Web for One to Microsoft Personal Web Server:
1. Install Microsoft Personal Web Server.
This installation will not affect Web for One. Web for One will continue to
publish your Web site, until you manually switch to Microsoft Personal Web
Server, as described in this section.
2. Open the Microsoft Personal Web Server control panel.
3. Configure the server options, and re-enter information in the About Me
and Links panels. Do not click the Start button yet.
The Microsoft Personal Web Server installer places a new default Web site
on your hard disk. If you want to continue to use your original Web site
folder, click Set Folder... and select that folder.
4. Update your Web site folder.
Personal Web Server does not support the server include and form processing
syntax used by Web for One. The "My Personal Web Site" folder installed
with Personal Web Server contains updated versions of the default pages
installed with Web for One.
If you continue to publish the folder you published with Web for One,
replace the default pages installed with Web for One with those from the
"My Personal Web Site" folder. (Do not replace the "$messages" folder or
its contents.) If you modified these default pages or have other pages on
your site that use the old syntax, you must update those pages to use the
ASP syntax.
If you elect to publish the new "My Personal Web Site" folder, make sure to
copy over any files from your original Web site folder that you want to
publish. If you want to keep existing messages left by visitors to your
site, replace the "$messages" folder in "My Personal Web Site" with the
"$messages" folder from your original site. Do not replace the other
default files unless you manually update the server include and form
processing syntax in the older versions.
5. Turn off and remove Web for One.
To do this, open the Web for One control panel, and if Web publishing is
on, click Stop. Then, close the control panel and remove Web for One from
the Control Panels folder. Finally, open the Extensions folder, located
inside your System Folder, and remove the Web for One Extension. (You may
save the control panel and extension outside the System folder, or drag
them into the Trash.)
6. Click Start in the Microsoft Personal Web Server control panel to begin
publishing your Web site again.
