<P>
<P><h3>Starting the HTTP and FTP Services</h3>
 
<P>
Personal Web Server supports the following two types of services:

<UL><LI>The HTTP (Hypertext Transport Protocol) service allows people to access
   Web pages on your computer.

<LI>The FTP (File Transfer Protocol) service allows people to view files on
   your computer and copy files to and from your computer using the FTP
   protocol.
<P>
</UL>Personal Web Server can be configured so that one or both of the HTTP and
FTP services start automatically when you start Windows 95. If the services
are not configured to start automatically, you can start them manually at
any time. The HTTP service is configured to start automatically by default,
but the FTP service is not.
<P>
To configure the HTTP or FTP service to start automatically when you start
Windows 95, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

<P><LI>In Control Panel, double-click Personal Web Server.

<P><LI>Click the Services tab, click the service that you want to start
   automatically in the Services area, and then click Properties.

<P><LI>In the Startup Options area, click Automatic.
<P>
</OL>To manually start a service that is not configured to start automatically,
follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

<P><LI>In Control Panel, double-click Personal Web Server.

<P><LI>Click the Services tab, click the service that you want to start in the
   Services area, and then click Start.
<P>
</OL><h3>Configuring the HTTP and FTP Services</h3>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Configuring the HTTP Service</h3>
 
<P>
After you start the HTTP service, people can access Web pages on your
computer using the following Internet address
<P>
<PRE>   <B>http://&lt;computer&gt;</B>

</PRE></OL>where &lt;computer&gt; is your computer name. To verify the Internet address that
people should use to access Web pages on your computer, double-click
Personal Web Server in Control Panel and then view the address at the top
of the General tab. To change the address that people use to access your
computer, you must change your computer name.
<P>
To modify the Web page that appears by default when people use the above
address to access your computer, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

<P><LI>In Control Panel, double-click Personal Web Server.

<P><LI>Click the Services tab, click HTTP in the Services area, and then click
   Properties.

<P><LI>Click Change Home Page and then type the file name associated with the
   Web page that you want to appear in the Default Document box. Note that
   the Web page must be located in the home root folder for the HTTP
   service.
<P>
</OL>Web pages other than the default Web page can be accessed using the
following address syntax
<P>
<PRE>   <B>http://&lt;computer&gt;/&lt;folder&gt;/&lt;page&gt;</B>

</PRE></OL>where &lt;computer&gt; is your computer name, &lt;folder&gt; is the alias for the
folder in which the Web page is located, and &lt;page&gt; is file name associated
with the Web page. To allow people to access Web pages on your computer,
you must share the folder that contains the Web page in Personal Web Server
and assign an alias to the folder. The alias for the folder must be used to
access Web pages in the folder instead of the actual folder name. For
additional information about sharing folders in Personal Web Server, see
the "Sharing Folders" section in this article.
<P>
If the Web page you want to access is located in the home root folder, you
do not need to specify a folder alias in the address. Note that the alias
for the home root folder should not be changed. Doing so can cause problems
that may require you to reinstall Personal Web Server.
<P>
<P><h3>Configuring the FTP Service</h3>
 
<P>
After you start the FTP service, people can view files on your computer and
copy files to and from your computer using the following Internet address
<P>
<PRE>   <B>ftp://&lt;computer&gt;</B>

</PRE>where &lt;computer&gt; is your computer name. To verify the Internet address that
people should use when using FTP to access files on your computer, double-
click Personal Web Server in Control Panel, click the Services tab, click
FTP in the Services area, click Properties, and then view the address in
the FTP Home Root Settings area. To change the address that people use to
access files on your computer, you must change your computer name.
<P>
When people use the above address to access your computer, the contents of
the home root folder for the FTP service are displayed. To change the
folder whose contents are displayed when people use the above address to
access your computer, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

<P><LI>In Control Panel, double-click Personal Web Server.

<P><LI>Click the Administration tab, click Administration, and then click FTP
   Administration.

<P><LI>Click the Directories tab and then click Edit on line for the current
   home root folder.

<P><LI>Click Virtual Directory, and then click OK.

<P><LI>Click Edit on the line for the folder that you want to be the home root
   folder, click Home Directory, and then click OK.
<P>
</OL>To modify other settings for the FTP service, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

<P><LI>Click the Administration tab, click Administration, and then click FTP
   Administration.

<P><LI>Modify one or more settings on the Services tab.
<P>
   NOTE: Personal Web Server should not be configured so that the Allow
   Anonymous Connections check box is cleared and the Allow Only Anonymous
   Connections check box is selected. If Personal Web Server is configured
   in this manner, no FTP connections are allowed.
<P>
</OL><h3>Sharing Folders</h3>
 
<P>
To share a folder on your computer so that people can access Web pages in
the folder, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

<P><LI>In Control Panel, double-click Personal Web Server.

<P><LI>Click the Administration tab, click Administration, and then click WWW
   Administration.

<P><LI>Click the Directories tab and then click Add.

<P><LI>Type the full path to the folder in the Directory box, type an alias
   for the folder in the Directory Alias box, click one or both of the
   Read and Execute check boxes to select them, and then click OK. Note
   that you can click Browse to locate the folder instead of typing the
   name of the folder manually.
<P>

<P>
</OL><h3>Configuring Security</h3>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Specifying an Access Control Type</h3>
 
<P>
Personal Web Server uses the same type of access control as the computer on
which it is running. If the "File and printer sharing for Microsoft
Networks" network service is installed, the computer can use share-level
security or user-level security with pass-through validation provided by a
Windows NT domain or Windows NT-based computer. If the "File and printer
sharing for NetWare Networks" network service is installed, the computer
can use user-level security with pass-through validation provided by a
Novell NetWare server. If neither network service is installed, Personal
Web Server must use local security.
<P>
To use share-level or user-level security in Personal Web Server, the
appropriate network service must be installed and configured properly. To
add a network service in Windows 95, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

<P><LI>In Control Panel, double-click Network.

<P><LI>Click Add, click Network Service, and then click Add.

<P><LI>In the Manufacturers box, click Microsoft. In the Network Services box,
   click "File and printer sharing for Microsoft Networks" or "File and
   printer sharing for NetWare Networks."

<P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
</OL>To configure Windows 95 to use a particular type of access control, double-
click Network in Control Panel, click the Access Control tab, and then
click Share-Level Access Control or User-Level Access Control. If you click
User-Level Access Control, you must also type the name of the Windows NT
domain, Windows NT-based computer, or Novell NetWare server used to provide
pass-through validation in the "Obtain list of users and groups from" box.
<P>
NOTE: After you change the type of access control a computer is using, any
resources that were shared on that computer are no longer shared. You must
share the resources again to allow other people to access them. In
addition, note that remote administration of Personal Web Server is not
supported when share-level security is used.
<P>
To use local security in Personal Web Server, double-click Network in
Control Panel, click File And Printer Sharing, and then click the "I want
to be able to give others access to my files" and "I want to be able to
allow others to print to my printer(s)" check boxes to clear them.
<P>
NOTE: When Personal Web Server is configured for local security, Dial-Up
Networking Server does not function properly.
<P>
<P><h3>Specifying a Method of Password Authentication</h3>
 
<P>
Personal Web Server can be configured to use basic password authentication
or Windows NT Challenge/Response password authentication. In addition, it
can be configured to allow anonymous connections.
<P>
When basic password authentication is used, the user name and password that
people enter when they access your computer are not encrypted before they
are passed across the network. This method of password authentication makes
it very easy for other people to decode the user name and password. When
Windows NT Challenge/Response password authentication is used, the user
name and password are encrypted before they are passed across the network.
This method provides additional security by making it very difficult for
other people to decode the user name and password.
<P>
NOTE: To use Windows NT Challenge/Response password authentication in
Personal Web Server, the computer on which Personal Web Server is running
must be using user-level security with pass-through validation provided by
a Windows NT domain.
<P>
To configure Personal Web Server to use a particular method of password
authentication, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

<P><LI>In Control Panel, double-click Personal Web Server.

<P><LI>Click the Administration tab, click Administration, and then click WWW
   Administration.

<P><LI>Click the Basic or Windows NT Challenge/Response check box to select it.
<P>
</OL><h3>Adding Users and Groups to the Local User List</h3>
 
<P>
If you configure Personal Web Server to use local security, you must add
people to the local user list to allow them to access Web pages and files
on your computer. You can also add groups to the local user list and add
people to the groups.
<P>
To add a person to the local user list, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

<P><LI>In Control Panel, double-click Personal Web Server.

<P><LI>Click the Administration tab, click Administration, and then click Local
   User Administration.

<P><LI>On the Users tab, click New User, type a user name in the "User Name"
   box, type a password in the "User Password" and "Confirm Password"
   boxes, and then click Add.
<P>
   NOTE: Each person in the local user list must have a password. Personal
   Web Server does not support null passwords.
<P>
</OL>To add a group to the local user list, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

<P><LI>In Control Panel, double-click Personal Web Server.

<P><LI>Click the Administration tab, click Administration, and then click Local
   User Administration.

<P><LI>Click the Groups tab, click New Group, type a name for the group in the
   "Group Name" box, and then click Add.
<P>
</OL>To add a person to a particular group, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

<P><LI>In Control Panel, double-click Personal Web Server.

<P><LI>Click the Administration tab, click Administration, and then click Local
   User Administration.

<P><LI>Click the User/Group tab, click the person that you want to add to a
   group in the User List box, click the group to which you want to add the
   person in the Group List box, and then click Add User To Group.
<P>
</OL><h3>Administering Personal Web Server Remotely</h3>
 
<P>
Personal Web Server can be configured so that you can administer it from
another computer. To administer Personal Web Server from another computer,
the computer on which Personal Web Server is installed and the computer
from which you want to administer Personal Web Server must be on the same
network, or the computer on which Personal Web Server is installed must be
able to be accessed over the Internet.
<P>
To configure Personal Web Server and Windows 95 so that Personal Web Server
can be administered from another computer, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>If Personal Web Server is configured for local security, add any people
   that you want to be able to administer Personal Web Server remotely to
   the local user list. For information about how to do so, see the "Adding
   Users and Groups to the Local User List" section in this article. If
   Personal Web Server is not configured for local security, proceed to
   step 2.

<P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

<P><LI>In Control Panel, double-click Passwords.

<P><LI>Click the Remote Administration tab, click the Enable Remote
   Administration Of This Server check box to select it, and then click
   Add.

<P><LI>Click the person that you want to be able to administer Personal Web
   Server remotely in the list of names and then click Add. Repeat this
   step for each person that you want to be able to administer Personal Web
   Server remotely.
<P>
</OL>To administer Personal Web Server from another computer, access the
following Web page from the other computer
<P>
<PRE>   <B>http://&lt;computer&gt;/htmla/htmla.htm</B>

</PRE></OL>where &lt;computer&gt; is the computer name of the computer on which Personal Web
Server is installed. If you want to access the computer over the Internet
instead of a network, you must establish a connection to the Internet
before accessing the above address. For additional information about
connecting to the Internet in Windows 95, please see the following article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
