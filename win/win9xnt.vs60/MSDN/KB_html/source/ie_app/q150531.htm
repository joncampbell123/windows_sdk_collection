The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Internet Explorer version 2.01 for Windows 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes the following known issues with Internet Explorer
2.01 for Windows 3.1:

<UL><LI>Graphic .xbm images cannot be independently viewed in the browser
   window
<LI>Graphic .xbm images displayed in an Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)
   document disappear
<LI>ALT tag is not displayed unless a WIDTH &amp; HEIGHT setting are specified
<LI>Pressing F5 to refresh page does not work if address field is selected
<LI>Starting an .exe file by using a link creates two cache files
<LI>Resources are lost after closing Internet Explorer
<LI>No options for setting security level preferences
<LI>Colored links are not printed on dot-matrix printers
<LI>Large graphics may be printed on more than one page
<LI>Previous installation directory is left in path after upgrade
<LI>.htm files are not associated with Iexplore.exe during installation
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Graphic .xbm Images Cannot Be Independently Viewed in the Browser Window</h3>
 
<P>
When you click a hypertext link to an .xbm image, the image is not
displayed in the browser window.
<P>
You can view .xbm graphic files only when they are referenced in an
HTML document.
<P>
<P><h3>Graphic .xbm Images Displayed in an HTML Document Disappear</h3>
 
<P>
After you attempt to load an .xbm image independently, the previously
displayed image may disappear from the HTML document.
<P>
The HTML document must be refreshed to display the original .xbm graphic.
<P>
<P><h3>ALT Tag Is Not Displayed Unless a WIDTH &amp; HEIGHT Setting Are Specified</h3>
 
<P>
When you view an HTML document that contains graphics, the ALT text
information for a graphic is not visible in place of the graphic if the
Show Pictures option is disabled.
<P>
<P><h3>Pressing F5 to Refresh Page Does Not Work If Address Field Is Selected</h3>
 
<P>
Pressing F5 does not refresh the current HTML document if the Address is
currently selected.
<P>
<P><h3>Starting an .Exe File by Using a Link Creates Two Cache Files</h3>
 
<P>
When you open an executable file, a temporary .exe file and the actual
.exe file are created. The temporary file can be removed by emptying the
cache, but the actual .exe file must be removed manually.
<P>
<P><h3>Resources Lost After Closing Internet Explorer 2.01</h3>
 
<P>
Not all system resources may be recovered after you quit Internet Explorer.
<P>
<P><h3>No Options for Setting Security Level Preferences</h3>
 
<P>
There is no Security tab in the Options dialog box as there is in Internet
Explorer 2.0 for Microsoft Windows 95. By default, the security level is
set too low for sending and viewing data over the Internet and cannot be
changed.
<P>
<P><h3>Colored Links Are Not Printed on Dot-Matrix Printers</h3>
 
<P>
Colored hypertext shortcut links in an HTML document may not be printed
correctly to some dot-matrix printers. Setting the color of the Already
Viewed and Not Yet Viewed shortcuts to black on the Appearance tab in the
Options dialog box allows the links to be printed correctly.
<P>
<P><h3>Large Graphics May Be Printed on More Than One Page</h3>
 
<P>
When you print an HTML document that has many large graphic images, the
graphics may be printed on separate pages even if they could fit on one.
<P>
<P><h3>Previous Installation Directory Is Left in Path After Upgrade</h3>
 
<P>
If you install Internet Explorer 2.01 to a different folder than your
earlier version of Internet Explorer, the path to the earlier version
remains in the Path statement in the Autoexec.bat file.
<P>
The reference to the previous version must be manually removed from the
Path statement.
<P>
<P><h3>.htm Files Are Not Associated with Iexplore.exe During Installation</h3>
 
<P>
Iexplore.exe is not associated with .htm and .html files until the first
time it is run. You are then prompted to make Internet Explorer the
default browser. This is true even if there is no other browser installed
on your computer.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed these to be problems in Microsoft Internet
Explorer version 2.01. We are researching these problems and will post
new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
