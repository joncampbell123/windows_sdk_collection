The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Internet Mail and News version 1.0 for Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes troubleshooting steps you can use to help you
diagnose problems that may occur when you connect to your Simple Mail
Transport Protocol (SMTP) or POP3 mail server with Internet Mail.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>SMTP and POP3 Server Settings</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft supports configuring Internet Mail to connect to one SMTP and
one POP3 mail server. The default port addresses for SMTP and POP3
connections in Internet Mail are 25 and 110, respectively.
<P>
If you experience problems connecting to your mail servers, make sure that
your SMTP and POP3 server port settings are correct. You can check your
current port address settings or configure Internet Mail to use different
port addresses using the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click Options on the Mail menu in Internet Mail, click the Server tab,
   and then click Advanced Settings.

<P><LI>Change the Outgoing Mail (SMTP) Server and Incoming Mail (POP3) Server
   settings as needed, click OK, and then click OK again.

<P><LI>Close and restart Internet Mail.
<P>
</OL><h3>TCP/IP Settings</h3>
 
<P>
Use ALL of the following troubleshooting methods to ensure that your
configuration settings are correct and that your dial-up connection is
functioning properly.
<P>
Method 1:
<P>
Test the integrity of your local Transmission Control Protocol/Internet
Protocol (TCP/IP) stack integrity, by pinging the appropriate (loopback)
<PRE>Internet Protocol (IP) address.   To do this, follow these steps:

</PRE><P><LI>Click Start, point to Programs, and then click MS-DOS Prompt.

<P><LI>Type the following command at the command prompt:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ping 127.0.0.1
</PRE><P>
   If you cannot ping this address, remove and reinstall the TCP/IP
   protocol.
<P>
   For information about TCP/IP, click Start, click Help, click the Index
   tab, type "TCP/IP" (without quotation marks), and then double-click the
   TCP/IP topic you want to view.
<P>
</OL>Method 2:
<P>
Test your TCP/IP settings by pinging the Microsoft File Transfer Protocol
(FTP) server. To do this, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click Start, point to Programs, and then click MS-DOS Prompt.

<P><LI>Type the following command at the command prompt:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ping 198.105.232.1
</PRE><P>
   If you can successfully ping the IP address in Method 1, but you cannot
   ping this address, check your TCP/IP settings to ensure that TCP/IP
   is properly configured.
<P>
   For information about TCP/IP, click Start, click Help, click the Index
   tab, type "TCP/IP" (without quotation marks), and then double-click the
   TCP/IP topic you want to view.
<P>
</OL>Method 3:
<P>
Make sure that Domain Name Service (DNS) resolution is functioning by
pinging the Microsoft FTP server. To do this, use the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click Start, point to Programs, and then click MS-DOS Prompt.

<P><LI>Type the following command at the command prompt:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ping ftp.microsoft.com
</PRE><P>
   If you can successfully ping the IP addresses in methods 1 and 2, but
   you cannot ping this address, check your DNS settings to ensure that
   DNS is properly configured.
<P>
   For information about DNS, click Start, click Help, click the Index tab,
   type "DNS" (without quotation marks), and then double-click the DNS
   topic you want to view.
<P>
</OL>Method 4:
<P>
Verify that mailer daemons are responding on their specified ports by using
Telnet commands. To do this, use the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click Start, point to Programs, and then click MS-DOS Prompt.

<P><LI>Type each of the following command and press ENTER after each one:
<P>
<P><PRE>      telnet &lt;smtp_name&gt; &lt;port_number&gt;
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      telnet &lt;pop3_name) &lt;port_number&gt;
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;smtp_name&gt; and &lt;pop3_name&gt; are the names of your SMTP and POP3
   servers, and &lt;port_number&gt; is the port address used by your SMTP
   and POP3 servers.
<P>
   If you do not receive a "ready" response from these Telnet commands,
   try to ping the host names of the SMTP and POP3 servers individually.
   If you cannot ping the host names of the SMTP or POP3 server, try using
   the numeric equivalents, if you know them.
<P>
   If you cannot ping the numeric addresses, but methods 1 through 3 are
   successful, contact your Internet service provider to verify that
   the mail servers are available and that your mail server information is
   correct.
