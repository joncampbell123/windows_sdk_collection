</PRE><h3>Troubleshooting Importing Messages</h3>
 
<P>
To troubleshoot problems when you attempt to import messages, perform the
following steps. After performing each step, check to see if the problem
has been resolved.

<OL><P><LI>Obtain the latest update for Microsoft Internet Mail and News.

<P><LI>Verify that the Imnimp.dll file in the Windows\System folder is not
   missing or damaged. To do so, reinstall Microsoft Internet Mail and
   News from the online source from which you originally installed it.

<P><LI>Verify that the set of personal folders from which you are attempting
   to import messages is functioning properly. To do so, follow these
   steps:
<P>
<P><PRE>    a. Create a new Microsoft Exchange profile that contains only the
       Personal Address Book and Personal Folders information services. You
       should create a new personal address book (.pab file) and new set of
       personal folders (.pst file), instead of using the .pab and .pst
       files already on your hard disk. If you require assistance creating
       a new Microsoft Exchange profile, please consult the Microsoft
       Exchange documentation.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    b. Start Microsoft Exchange using the new profile, create a new
       message, and then save the message to the Inbox.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    c. In Internet Mail, attempt to import the Inbox from the new set of
       personal folders.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Verify that your mail client's message store is functioning properly.
   To do so, follow these steps:
<P>
<P><PRE>    a. Create a new message store using your mail client.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    b. Start your mail client using the new message store, create a new
       message, and then save the message to the Inbox.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    c. In Internet Mail, attempt to import the Inbox from the new message
       store.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Refer to troubleshooting steps for your mail client.
<P>
</OL><h3>Troubleshooting Importing Address Book Entries</h3>
 
<P>
To troubleshoot problems attempting to import entries from an address
book, perform the following steps. After performing each step, check to
see if the problem has been resolved.

<OL><P><LI>Obtain the latest update for Microsoft Internet Mail and News.

<P><LI>Verify that the Wab32.dll file in the Windows\System folder and the
   Wabmig.exe file in the Windows folder is not missing or damaged. To do
   so, reinstall Microsoft Internet Mail and News from the online source
   from which you originally installed it.

<P><LI>Verify that the personal address book from which you are attempting to
   import entries is functioning properly. To do so, follow these steps:
<P>
   NOTE: Although Internet Mail imports all the entries in a personal
   address book, only the Internet Mail (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
   (SMTP)) entries can be used in Internet Mail. Therefore, SMTP entries
   should be used when you are testing whether the personal address book is
   functioning properly. Because SMTP entries are associated with the
   Internet Mail information service, that service must be installed in
   addition to the Personal Address Book and Personal Folders information
   services.
<P>
<P><PRE>    a. Create a new address book for your mail client. If you require
       assistance creating an address book for your mail client, please
       consult the client's documentation or manufacturer.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    b. Start the mail client using the new address book, and then create
       one or more Internet Mail personal address book entries.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    c. In Internet Mail, attempt to import the new personal address book.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Refer to troubleshooting steps for your mail client.
