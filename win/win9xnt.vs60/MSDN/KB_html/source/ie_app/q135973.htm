The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 2.0, 3.0 for Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you click a link to a binary file in Microsoft Internet Explorer
version 2.0 or 3.0 for Windows 95, Internet Explorer may display the
contents of the file as if the file were a text file, instead of
displaying the file itself. In addition, if you have installed the VRML Add-
In and you attempt to load a Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML) page
(or virtual world) in Internet Explorer 3.0, the following message may be
displayed:
<P>
<PRE>   Opening:
   <B>http://&lt;site&gt;/&lt;page&gt;.wrl.gz</B>

   Some files can contain viruses or otherwise be harmful to your
   computer. It is important to be certain that this file is from a
   trustworthy source.

   What would you like to do with this file?

</PRE>If you click Open It and then click OK, the VRML page is not displayed.
Note that the above message is not normally displayed when you have
installed the VRML Add-In and you attempt to load a VRML page in Internet
Explorer 3.0.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs when the binary file or VRML page has an incorrect
MIME content type (hint) of "text/html." When Internet Explorer attempts
to access a file on the Internet, it receives a hint from the Hypertext
Transfer Protocol (HTTP) server that it uses to determine whether the file
is binary or text. If the server sends Internet Explorer the wrong hint,
Internet Explorer is unable to correctly identify the file and may display
the contents of the file instead of displaying the file itself. This
problem typically occurs as the result of an improperly configured server.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
If you are attempting to access a binary file, you may be able to work
around this problem by using the FTP tool (Ftp.exe) included with Windows
95 to access the file instead.
<P>
If you are unable to access a binary file even after using the above
workaround, or if you are unable to access a VRML page, you should contact
the administrator of the Web site to report the problem and inquire about
additional workarounds that will allow you to access the file or VRML page.
