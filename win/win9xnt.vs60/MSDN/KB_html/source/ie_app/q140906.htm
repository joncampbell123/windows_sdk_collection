   you receive a BINHEX-encoded attachment, you may be unable to open it.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>

<P>
BINHEX file encoding converts a binary file into a hexadecimal text
representation. This allows the file to be transmitted as the text of an
e-mail message across a variety of mail servers and network types. BINHEX
encoding and decoding is frequently used to transmit files between the
Macintosh and PC platforms. BINHEX-encoded files commonly have an .hqx
file extension.
