</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article contains a copy of the information in the "Read Me --
Important!" file included on the Microsoft Empowerment Pack for the Mac CD-
ROM.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Welcome!
<P>
This CD contains a number of software tools and updates for your Macintosh,
including:

<UL><LI>System 7.5 Update 2.0 -- bug fixes and performance enhancements for
   Apple's System 7.5
<LI>Microsoft Internet Explorer 2.0 -- this fast, powerful Internet browser
   was designed specifically for your Macintosh
<LI>Internet Assistant for Microsoft Word -- this add-in for Microsoft Word
   6.0.1 makes it easy to create and edit great-looking documents for the
   World Wide Web.
<LI>Internet Assistant for Microsoft Excel -- this add-in for Microsoft
   Excel 5.0 lets you convert your spreadsheets to Hypertext Markup
   Language (HTML) tables, while maintaining all the rich formatting of
   your original spreadsheet document
<LI>Microsoft Word 6.0.1a Update -- this update offers Word 6.0 users
   improved performance and stability, including faster boot and word count
   times, better font handling, resolved extension conflicts, and more.
<P>
</UL>We've prepared a guided tour to introduce you to all of the programs and
updates included on the CD. To start the tour, just double-click on the
"Microsoft Empowerment Pack" icon at the root level of the CD. Before you
do, though, please read the notes below. They contain important information
about how the tour works, and on what system configurations it will run
best.
<P>
System Requirements
<P>
The guided tour is presented using the Microsoft Internet Explorer. To run
the Internet Explorer, your system must have:

<UL><LI>a 68030 processor or better
<LI>System 7.0.1 or above*
<LI>8 MB of RAM
<LI>2 - 4 MB of hard disk space
<P>
</UL>*Note: if you have a 68k Macintosh and are running a System version earlier
than 7.5, you will need to install Thread Manager 2.0. You can do this by
running the Internet Explorer installation program, located in the
"Internet Explorer" folder of this CD.
<P>
Access to the Internet
<P>
The guided tour will run fine even if you aren't connect to the Internet.
Some features of the Internet Explorer won't be available to you without an
Internet connection, though. For example,

<UL><LI>You will not be able to read newsgroups or send mail using Internet
   Explorer
<LI>You may not be able to change Internet Explorer's Options settings
<LI>The "Home" and "Search" buttons on the Internet Explorer toolbar may
   result in "File not Found" errors.  This is because the Internet
   Explorer is looking for documents located on the Web, and can't find
   them without an Internet connection.
<P>
</UL>Installing Updates for Microsoft Word
<P>
In order to install the Internet Assistant for Microsoft Word or the Word
6.0.1a Update from within the guided tour, you will need at least 2700
bytes of additional RAM free. Because the System typically takes at least
two megabytes of RAM, users with 8 Mb systems will need to enable Virtual
Memory from the Memory Control Panel in order to install these programs
from within the guided tour (see the Virtual Memory Tips in the "Tips &amp;
Tricks" folder of this CD for more information about using virtual memory
on your Macintosh). You can also launch the setup applications for these
programs directly from the CD without going through the guided tour.
