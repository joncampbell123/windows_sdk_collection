<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when the Internet Explorer Installer program does not
properly remove all the files that were copied to your hard disk during
the installation of Internet Explorer.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To completely remove all the files that were copied to your hard disk
during the installation of Internet Explorer, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Run the Internet Explorer Installer program to remove Internet 
   Explorer, if you have not already done so. Note that you may want 
   to make a backup copy of the Favorites.htm file in the System 
   Folder:Preferences:Explorer folder before removing Internet 
   Explorer. To make a backup copy of the file, copy it to a floppy disk 
   or another folder on your hard disk.

<P><LI>Delete the following folders, if they exist. To delete a folder, 
   double-click your hard disk, locate the folder, and then drag the 
   folder to the Trash.
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Microsoft Internet Applications
    - My Personal Web Site
    - System Folder:Java
    - System Folder:MS Internet
    - System Folder:Preferences:Explorer
</PRE>
<P><LI>Delete the following files, if they exist. To delete a file, double-
   click your hard disk, locate the file, and then drag the file to the 
   Trash.
<P>
<P><PRE>    - System Folder:Control Panels:Microsoft Personal Web Server

   saved by this program. You may want to keep Internet Config. To remove 
   Internet Config 1.3, delete the following folder and file:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Internet Config 1.3
    - System Folder:Preferences:Internet Preferences
</PRE><P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>

in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Internet Explorer Installer program is used to install and remove
Internet Explorer, Microsoft Internet Mail and News, Microsoft Personal
Web Server, and Internet Config. When you remove a program, the Installer 
program normally removes all the files that were copied to your hard disk
during the installation of that program. However, when you remove Internet
Explorer 3.0 for Macintosh, all the files are not removed.
