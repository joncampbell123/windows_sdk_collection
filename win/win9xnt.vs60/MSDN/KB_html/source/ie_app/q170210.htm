<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how to configure third-party programs for use as
file helpers with Internet Explorer 3.01a and 4.0 for Macintosh.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
File helpers are programs that are used by Internet Explorer to open file
types that Internet Explorer does not know how to handle.
<P>
<P><h3>Adding File Helpers</h3>
 
<P>
To add a file helper, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Edit menu, click Preferences, and then click File Helpers in
   the Receiving Files list.

<P><LI>Click Add to open the Edit File Helper dialog box, and then type a
   description, extension, and Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions
   (MIME) type in the Representation section.
<P>
   NOTE: You can find a list of common MIME types in the "File Helpers
   Directory" topic in Internet Explorer Help.

<P><LI>In the File Type section, type the file Type and Creator for the
   type of file the file helper will open.
<P>
   A file's Creator and Type attributes identify the parent program of a
   file and its specific kind. The Type attribute is used by other
   programs in order to determine whether a file is a valid document that
   can be opened. To determine a file's Creator and Type attributes, use a
   utility designed for this purpose, for example, ResEdit.

<P><LI>In the Handling section, click Browse to locate the program to be used
   to open the file type, and then click Open.

<P><LI>Click OK, and then click OK again.
<P>
</OL><h3>Changing File Helper Properties</h3>
 
<P>
To change the properties of a file helper, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Edit menu, click Preferences, and then click File Helpers in
   the Receiving Files list.

<P><LI>Click the file helper whose properties you want to change, and then
   click Change.

<P><LI>In the Edit File Helper dialog box, make the necessary changes to the
   file helper, click OK, and then click OK again.
<P>
</OL><h3>Deleting Helpers</h3>
 
<P>
To delete a file helper, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Edit menu, click Preferences, and then click File Helpers in
   the Receiving Files list.

<P><LI>Click the file helper you want to delete, and then click Delete.

<P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: File helper settings are stored in Internet Config, and may be
used by other Internet-based programs. Do not delete or change file
helpers unless you are sure you have written down all of the file
settings.
