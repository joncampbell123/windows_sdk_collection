<P>
<P><h3>Internet Explorer 2.1</h3>
 
<P>
Version 2.1 of Internet Explorer for Macintosh includes the following
features:

<UL><LI>Cross-platform dynamics: Support for new scrolling marquees and
   background sounds make Web pages more interactive and interesting.
   Internet Explorer supports QuickTime and AVI digital video formats, GIF 
   animation, and AU, AIFF, MIDI, and Wave sound formats for transparent 
   cross-platform playback. Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML) is 
   also supported via QuickDraw 3D.

<LI>Customizable home pages: The new Microsoft Network home page allows you
   to create your own customized home page. Add your favorite stocks,

   to even the most complex Web pages. This, coupled with a persistent
   page cache using standard Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Last-
   Modified-Since and Expires attributes, greatly improves browsing speed.

<LI>Placeholder Mode: Instead of waiting for large graphics to download
   before displaying text that follows, Internet Explorer automatically 
   puts in a placeholder for slow loading graphics and loads the text 
   first. This allows you to get the real information on the Web page much
   faster than other browsers.

<LI>Fast Connect: HTTP-KeepAlive is a protocol enhancement that allows
   Internet Explorer to open and download multiple items over the same 
   HTTP connection when used in conjunction with a KeepAlive-enabled 
   server.

<LI>Easy to Use: Internet Explorer for Macintosh's feature and interface
   compatibility with its Windows counterpart and integration with the 
   Macintosh make it ideal for cross-platform users

<LI>Open Transport/MacTCP: Both Open Transport (version 1.1+) and MacTCP
   (2.06+) are supported natively. You can use Internet Explorer 
   immediately with your existing Internet connection.

<LI>Integration with Macintosh: Developed specifically for use with Apple's
   System 7.1 operating system, Internet Explorer is completely integrated 
   with the Macintosh user interface and underlying architectures, 
   including support for AppleScript and Drag Manager.

<LI>PowerPC and 680x0: Internet Explorer is supported on both PowerPC and 
   Motorola 680x0 systems running system 7.1 and above.

<LI>Favorites: Support for importing and exporting Internet shortcuts and
   Bookmarks for complete compatibility with Microsoft Internet Explorer 
   for Windows and other browsers.

<LI>Search Button: A Search button on the toolbar provides instant access
   to powerful search engines like Yahoo, Lycos, and Infoseek.

<LI>Compatible: Internet Explorer extends compatibility to include all
   major Internet standards.

   tags, such as right align, centering, tables, client pull, server push,
   and much more.

   newsgroup reading with in-line graphics (GIF and JPEG) and news 
   posting.

<LI>HTTP Cookies: Support for Internet shopping tokens ("cookies") that
   allows you to shop on the Internet.

<LI>FTP and Gopher: Support for access to File Transfer Protocol (FTP) and 
   Gopher servers.

   controls.

   Internet preferences.

<LI>Mail: Support for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) mail allows 
   sending simple mail from within the browser.

<LI>Safe: Internet Explorer lets you shop with confidence.

<LI>SSL: Support for standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) 2.0 and 3.0 allows
   integration with secure sites.
<P>
</UL><h3>Internet Explorer 3.0</h3>
 
<P>
Version 3.0 of Internet Explorer for Macintosh includes the following
features, in addition to the features listed above:

<UL><LI>HTML enhancements: Internet Explorer provides the broadest support for
   HTML standards, including HTML 3.2. Internet Explorer includes support 
   for borderless and floating frames, animated GIFs, tables, and more. 
   Support for style sheets enable corporations to have a consistent 
   appearance throughout their Intranets and make it possible for 
   developers to create rich images without using large bitmaps.

<LI>Java tools: Microsoft has adopted Apple's JAM/JManager API that lets
   Internet Explorer use both the Microsoft Java VM, developed jointly by
   Microsoft and Metrowerks, as well as Apple's Java VM and provides the
   fastest and most extensive way to run Java programs. By including
   appropriate hooks for Java tools, Internet Explorer lets you use 
   scripting languages to link them to ActiveX controls, or other Java 
   tools, giving them even more power and functionality. Internet 
   Explorer's ability to dynamically load and unload the Java VM when
   needed both maximizes performance and effectively uses the system
   resources of the Macintosh.

<LI>ActiveX controls: ActiveX controls turn today's Web pages into
   animated, interactive Web environments in Internet Explorer. ActiveX 
   controls are software components that have been designed to be small, 
   lightweight, and fast on the Internet.

<LI>Multimedia enhancements: Web pages come alive with Internet Explorer
   through built-in multimedia support and ActiveX/Java multimedia 
   controls. Support for scrolling marquees and background sounds make 
   World Wide Web (WWW) pages more interactive and interesting. Internet 
   Explorer for Macintosh supports QuickTime, QuickTime VR, and AVI 
   digital video formats natively with or without a Plug-in, GIF 
   animation, and AU, AIFF, MIDI and Wave sound formats for transparent 
   cross-platform playback.

<LI>3-D with VRML: Viewing three-dimensional (3-D) sites and elements based 
   on the Virtual Reality Markup Language (VRML) is supported using 
   QuickDraw 3D. (NOTE: This limits VRML to PowerMacintoshes only)

<LI>Fast and small: Internet Explorer provides the best browser performance 
   for Apple Macintosh computers while using less system resources than 
   other browsers.

<LI>Performance: Support for Apple's Thread Manager and Progressive
   Rendering greatly increase the responsiveness of the user interface to
   even the most complex Web pages. This, coupled with a persistent page
   cache using standard HTTP Last-Modified-Since and Expires attributes,
   greatly improves browsing speed.

<LI>Fast text: Instead of waiting for large graphics to download before
   displaying text that follows, Internet Explorer automatically puts in a 
   place-holder for slow-loading graphics and loads the text first. This 
   allows you to get the real information on the Web page much faster than 
   other browsers.

<LI>Fast connect: HTTP-KeepAlive is a protocol enhancement that allows
   Internet Explorer to open and download multiple items over the same 
   HTTP connection when used in conjunction with a KeepAlive-enabled 
   server.

<LI>Personalized exploring and easy to use: Full integration with the
   Macintosh, enabling you to simplify and personalize your Internet
   experience in an easy to use way!  Personalize your browser--customize
   your toolbar, Favorites folder, and your home page to suit your
   preferences. In addition, customizable built-in links to important
   sites let you quickly connect and start exploring.

<LI>Administration Kit: Customize Internet Explorer to match the look and
   needs of your organization with this free Administration Kit. While
   Internet service providers (ISPs) and organizations can customize the 
   browser's look and feel, corporate customers can also configure user 
   options including security and proxy settings.

<LI>Open Transport/MacTCP: Both Open Transport (version 1.1+) and MacTCP
   (2.06+) are supported natively. You can use Internet Explorer
   immediately with your existing Internet connection.

<LI>Integration with Macintosh: Developed specifically for use with Apple's
   System 7.1 operating system, Internet Explorer is completely integrated 
   with the Macintosh user interface and underlying architectures,
   including support for AppleScript and Drag Manager.

<LI>Favorites: Support for importing and exporting Internet shortcuts and
   bookmarks for complete compatibility with Microsoft Internet Explorer
   for Windows and other browsers.

<LI>Search button: A Search button on the toolbar provides instant access
   to powerful search engines such as Yahoo, Lycos, and Infoseek.

<LI>Open and secure: Provides comprehensive, private, and secure commerce
   and communications.

<LI>Secure communications: Put your security concerns to rest with
   Internet Explorer, which lets you communicate securely on the Internet 
   with support for Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) 2.0.

<LI>Java tool security: Safely download software programs with Internet
   Explorer's support for different levels of code verification.

<LI>Communication and collaboration: Use the latest in computer and
   Internet technology to communicate and collaborate with other people

   e-mail through their Internet service provider's mail servers. All of 
   the options needed to send, receive, and reply to e-mail messages, even 
   in HTML, are easily accessible.

<LI>Microsoft Internet News: Anyone can subscribe, post, and read news on
   Internet USENET newsgroups with this new simple, integrated Internet
   newsreader. Features, such as a preview pane and folders, enable users
   to read articles quickly and filter out unwanted information.

<LI>Multilanguage support: Read pages authored in other languages with
   Internet Explorer's support for international character sets using
   Apple Language Pack. Also, Internet Explorer is available in nine 
   languages, helping you share information with people worldwide.
