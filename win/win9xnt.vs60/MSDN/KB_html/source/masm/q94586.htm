The following table of EXE2BIN errors is adapted from "The MS-DOS
Encyclopedia" (Microsoft Press). Even though EXE2BIN is provided with
MS-DOS, it is often used during the process of building an application with
the Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM).
<P>
Error: File cannot be converted
Cause: The program to be converted has one of the following problems:
<PRE>        - The program has an origin of 0100h but a different entry point.
        - The program requires segment fixups.
        - The program code and data are larger than 64 KB.
        - The program has more than one declared segment
        - The file is not a valid .EXE-format file.

</PRE>Error: File creation error
Cause: EXE2BIN cannot create the output file for one of the following
<PRE>       reasons:
        - A read-only file with the same name already exists
        - The specified directory is full
        - The specified disk is full, write-protected, or unreadable.

</PRE>Error: File not found
Cause: The file does not exist or the incorrect path was given.
<P>
Error: Fixups needed - base segment (hex):
Cause: The .EXE-format file contains segment references that would
<PRE>       ordinarily be relocated by the .EXE file loader. Specify the
       absolute segment address at which the converted module will be
       executed.

</PRE>Error: Incorrect DOS version
Cause: The version of EXE2BIN is not compatible with the version of MS-DOS
<PRE>       that is running.

</PRE>Error: Insufficient disk space
Cause: The destination disk has insufficient space to create the memory-
<PRE>       image output file.

</PRE>Error: Insufficient memory
Cause: Not enough memory is available to run EXE2BIN.
<P>
Error: WARNING - Read error in EXE file. Amount read less than size in
<PRE>       header.
</PRE>Cause: The file size given in the .EXE header is inconsistent with the
<PRE>       actual size of the file.
