The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Macro Assembler for MS-DOS, versions 1.25, 1.27, 3.0x,
   4.0, 5.0, and 5.1
</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Phase errors indicate that a relative address of a label changed
between pass 1 and pass 2 of the assembly process. They usually are
caused by improper forward references to labels. During pass 1, the
assembler will have to make assumptions (e.g. it might assume a near
jump during pass 1 if the location of a label is not known). During
pass 2, the assembler may have to change those assumptions (e.g. now
it knows that the jump is to a far label). If this involves changing
the size of an instruction, that difference can cause a phase error.
<P>
To examine the assumptions made by the assembler on pass 1, use the
/D option to get a pass 1 listing.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Phase errors can usually be prevented by using segment overrides or
explicit type specification, as shown in the following examples:
<P>
<PRE>   jmp dword ptr far_label         ;jump to far label

   mov ax, word ptr label
</PRE>
