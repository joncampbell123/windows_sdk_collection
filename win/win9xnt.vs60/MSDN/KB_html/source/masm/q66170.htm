<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
On Page 368 of the "Microsoft Macro Assembler Programmer's Guide," the last
sentence in the second paragraph from the bottom states the following:
<P>
<PRE>   Segment overrides can be used safely when interrupts are turned
   off, when a string instruction is used without a segment override,
   or when a 80386 processor is used.

</PRE>It should read as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   Segment overrides can be used safely when interrupts are turned
   off, when a string instruction is used without a repeat prefix, or
   when a 80386 processor is used.

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The repeat prefix may be used safely with segment overrides if a CLI
instruction is performed before the REP instruction and a STI
instruction is performed after it. This process shuts off interrupts
during the REP instruction that contains a segment override. Clearing
interrupts in this manner is only needed for instructions with segment
overrides that are preceded with REP.
<P>
Please note that the execution of a repeated instruction can take a
considerable amount of time; you may not want to have interrupts shut
off for that much time. It is the programmer's responsibility to
ensure that interrupts are not missed while interrupts are off.
<P>
A better alternative if you are moving a large amount of data is to
change the DS register for the duration of the repeated instruction
(so that the segment override is not needed) and restore it
afterwards.
<P>
The following is an example of using the CLI instruction to disable
interrupts and using the STI instruction to re-enable them:
<P>
<PRE>    ;   set SI and DI

    MOV CX, 20   ; relatively small number of bytes--won't take long
    CLI
    REP MOVS dest,ES:source
    STI

    ;   ...

</PRE>The following is an example of temporarily using the DS register to
avoid the segment override:
<P>
<PRE>    ;   set SI and DI

    MOV  CX, 4000h ; lots to move -- this will take some time
    PUSH DS        ; save for later
    PUSH ES        ; same as ES: override -- change for other overrides
    POP  DS        ; load into DS
    REP  MOVS dest, source
    POP  DS        ; restore DS
</PRE>
