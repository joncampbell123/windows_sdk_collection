The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Macro Assembler for MS-DOS, versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0b,
   6.1, 6.1a, and 6.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
A STRUCT declaration containing an ORG directive will change the current
segment size when the -Sf switch is used and a listing file is produced
with MASM 6.x.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When adding a first-pass listing (the -Sf switch) to the listing file,
MASM's internal location counter is affected when the ORG directive is
encountered within a STRUCT declaration. This location counter is
ultimately used to determine segment size.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
When declaring a STRUCT that contains an ORG directive, place the
declaration outside of any open segments. Because this is a structure
declaration rather than an actual instance, the structure does not have to
be within a segment and can be placed outside all open segments where the
location counter will not be adversely affected.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft Macro
Assembler (MASM) versions 6.x. We are researching this problem and will
post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following sample code illustrates this problem. When the structure is
declared within the open data segment, the size of the data segment is
increased. This can be viewed in the map file for the sample, as well as in
the listing file. Move the structure declaration before the .DATA and
.STACK directives to obtain the expected behavior.
<P>
An ORG directive is permitted in a structure declaration beginning with
MASM version 6.0. This enables the generation of a template that can ease
references to the internals of data structures that are predefined, for
instance by the operating system, the operating platform, or a high-level
language compiler.
<P>
For additional information about this MASM construct as well as sample code
demonstrating its use, please see the following article(s) in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:
