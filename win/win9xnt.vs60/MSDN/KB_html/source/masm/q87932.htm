The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Macro Assembler for MS-DOS, versions 6.0, 6.0a, and 6.0b
<LI>Microsoft Macro Assembler for OS/2, versions 6.0, 6.0a, and 6.0b

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In the online Help and on page 618 of the "Microsoft Macro Assembler
Programmer's Guide" for MASM versions 6.0, 6.0a, and 6.0b, the ALIAS
keyword is listed as a word that is reserved for future use. While the
feature was actually implemented in the assembler, it was not
documented as such.
<P>
The ALIAS directive was not documented because Microsoft recommends
using LINK 5.3 or later and LIB 3.2 or later when producing .EXEs,
.DLLs, or library modules that use this directive. These utilities did
not ship until Microsoft C/C++ 7.0; therefore, because the tools were
not available at the time that MASM 6.0 shipped, the directive was not
documented.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This feature is useful to map names used in one version of a product
to names used in another version of that product when they have
changed. The library OLDNAMES.LIB that ships with Microsoft C/C++
version 7.0 was created to map C 6.0 names to C/C++ 7.0 names and uses
this technology.
<P>
The syntax for the ALIAS directive is as follows
<P>
<PRE>   ALIAS  &lt;alias&gt; = &lt;actual-name&gt;

</PRE>where the angle brackets are required, alias is the alternate or alias
name, and actual-name is the actual name of the function or procedure.
Note that the new utilities, LINK 5.3 and LIB 3.2, should be used.
