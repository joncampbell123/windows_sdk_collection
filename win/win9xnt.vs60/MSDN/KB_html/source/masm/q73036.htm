The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Macro Assembler for MS-DOS, versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0b,
   6.1, 6.1a, and 6.11
<LI>Microsoft Macro Assembler for OS/2, versions 6.0, 6.0a, and 6.0b
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
With the Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), if the .NOLIST directive is
the first statement in a file and it is later followed by a .LISTALL
directive, then the macro expansion in the listing file will occur
before the macro call instead of after it.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
This problem can be eliminated by placing either a blank line or a
comment before the .NOLIST directive, so that .NOLIST is not on the
first line of the file.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in MASM version 6.0,
6.0a, 6.0b, 6.1, 6.1a, and 6.11. We are researching this problem and
will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The .NOLIST directive prevents the macro expansion of all macro calls
in the listing file. This option shows the macro call, but it does not
display the corresponding code. The .NOLIST directive also prevents a
complete listing of every macro in each file that is included with the
.INCLUDE directive. The .LISTALL directive lists all source lines,
including false conditionals and generated code for each macro.
<P>
In the sample code below, the placement of the .NOLIST directive
before the .INCLUDE directive prevents a general listing of every
macro in that include file. Placing the .LISTALL after the .INCLUDE
directive should cause the corresponding code for each macro to be
listed after that macro appears in the source code. For example, the
correct listing for TEST_MACRO should appear as follows:
<P>
<PRE>                  TEST_MACRO
   0000  55              1       PUSH  BP
   0001  8B EC           1       MOV   BP, SP

</PRE>However, if .NOLIST is the first statement on the first line in the
file, then this order is reversed and the macro expansion appears
before the macro call. The incorrect macro expansion actually appears
as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   0000  55              1       PUSH  BP
   0001  8B EC           1       MOV   BP, SP
                  TEST_MACRO

</PRE><h3>Sample Code</h3>
