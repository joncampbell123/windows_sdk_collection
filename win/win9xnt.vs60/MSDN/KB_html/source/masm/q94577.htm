The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Macro Assembler for MS-DOS and OS/2, versions 6.0, 6.0a,
   6.0b
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Versions 6.0, 6.0a, and 6.0b of the Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM)
provide the .MODEL flat directive to support generating 32-bit flat memory
model applications. When combined with the LINK386 utility and DOSCALLS.LIB
library provided with OS/2 version 2.0, you can generate a 32-bit flat
memory model application for the OS/2 version 2.0 environment.
<P>
To build a 32-bit flat memory model application for OS/2 2.0, perform the
following four steps:

<OL><P><LI>Place the INCLUDELIB DOSCALLS.LIB directive in each source module that
   contains a call into the OS/2 2.0 application programming interface
   (API). DOSCALLS.LIB is the OS/2 2.0 import library that supports
   application calls to the operating system.

<P><LI>Place the .386 or .486 directive before the .MODEL flat, syscall
   directive to ensure that your code and data segments are set up
   correctly for a 32-bit flat memory model application. The order in which
   these two directives appear in the source code is important.

<P><LI>Specify the /c assembler option flag on the assembler command line to
   prevent MASM from invoking its 16-bit linker.

<P><LI>Link the object files using LINK386 distributed with OS/2 2.0. If
   LINK386 cannot find the DOSCALLS.LIB file, specify the path to the
   library.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The LINK386 utility and DOSCALLS.LIB library are provided by IBM with OS/2
version 2.0. MASM versions 6.0, 6.0a, and 6.0b does not include either the
required library support for OS/2 operating system calls or a linker
capable of producing flat memory model applications. For more information
on LINK386, DOSCALLS.LIB, or the functions of the OS/2 2.0 API, please
contact IBM.
<P>
LINK386 may generate two warnings that can be safely ignored:
<P>
<PRE>   LINK386: warning L4071: application type not specified:
      assuming WINDOWCOMPAT
   LINK386: warning L4071: no automatic data segment

</PRE></OL>MASM version 6.1 does not run with any version of OS/2 including a DOS
window under OS/2. Microsoft does not support using MASM 6.1 for OS/2. Even
though code generated by MASM 6.1 running with MS-DOS may link with
LINK386, Microsoft does not support generating code in this manner.
