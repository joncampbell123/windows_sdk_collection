<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Macro Assembler for MS-DOS, version 6.11, 6.11c, 6.11d
<LI>Microsoft Macro Assembler for Windows NT, version 6.11, 6.11c, 6.11d
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you build the MASM WINDLL sample DLL project, SYSINFO generates this
linker error:
<P>
<PRE>   SYSINFO.OBJ(SYSINFO.ASM) : fatal error L1101: invalid object module

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This is due to a problem in the EXPDEF record in the .obj file created when
the EXPORT keyword is used to modify the attributes of a PROC.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
This problem can be avoided in these MASM versions in one of several ways:

<UL><LI>Do not use the EXPORT keyword. Remove the EXPORT keyword from the
   SYSINFO.ASM source file (four places). In this sample, the DLL's
   functions are exported in the .def file, so the EXPORT keyword is not
   necessary. This is the preferred solution.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Use a linker newer than LINK version 5.31.009, such as a linker that
   ships with a 16-bit Visual C++. The WINDLL sample, which contains the
   SYSINFO DLL, also contains the SYSDATA application used to call this
   DLL. To build the application, some portion of the Windows 3.1 SDK is
   required (the resource compiler) in addition to MASM. The most common
   place to get this additional requirement is from Visual C++ version 1.0
   Professional edition or Visual C++ version 1.5x. By placing the Visual
   C++ Bin directory in the path before the MASM BIN directory, the
   resource compiler will be found. In addition, the newer linker will be
   used instead of MASM's linker.
<P>
   In this solution, the .obj file still has a problem, but the linker does
   not stop the build. Instead it gives an L4059 warning that can be
   ignored. Because the .obj file has the problem in one of the EXPDEF
   records, the functions still need to be exported via the .def file. That
   is why the first solution is the preferred method.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Run MASM in a MS-DOS box under Windows version 3.1x (16-bit Windows).
   The problem seems to be sensitive to the environment in which MASM is
   run. In pure MS-DOS and under Windows NT, MASM version 6.11 always
   displays this problem, but when it is run in an MS-DOS box under Windows
   version 3.1x, no error occurs. In the latter case, the .obj file does
   not contain the error.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this bug
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as
it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This problem does not appear in MASM version 6.11a with this sample.
However it is likely that a problem still exists creating an EXPDEF
record using the EXPORT keyword in version 6.11a and the above resolutions
will apply.
