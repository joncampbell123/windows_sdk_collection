The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Macro Assembler for MS-DOS, version 6.0
<LI>Microsoft Macro Assembler for OS/2, version 6.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If one of the source files assembled by the Microsoft Macro Assembler
(MASM) version 6.0 contains a CTRL+Z character, the listing file generated
by the assembler may appear to be truncated immediately following the
position of that source file in the listing.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The CTRL+Z character is considered to be the end-of-file (EOF) character
for text files in DOS and OS/2. Many editors support this and use the
CTRL+Z as a file termination character. Unfortunately, when MASM 6.0 adds
files to the listing file, it reads the entire file including the CTRL+Z at
the end, if there is one, and places it in the listing. If you use the DOS
or OS/2 operating system commands, such as Type or Copy, to display the
resultant file, it will seem to end at the first occurrence of a CTRL+Z
(EOF) character.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
If your editor supports saving a file without a CTRL+Z as the termination
character, this is the easiest way to work around this problem. If there is
no CTRL+Z in the source file, it cannot be transferred to the list file.
<P>
If you cannot eliminate the CTRL+Z characters, you can load the list file
into the Programmer's WorkBench (PWB) and remove the CTRL+Z character(s)
from the file. Because PWB does not rely on CTRL+Z characters for EOFs, the
CTRL+Z characters will be displayed as right arrow characters (-&gt;). You can
delete these characters just as you can delete any other character. After
removing the CTRL+Z characters, the DOS or OS/2 commands will operate on
the listing file as expected.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in MASM version 6.0. This
problem was corrected in MASM version 6.0a.
