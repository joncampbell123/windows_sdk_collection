<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In MASM 6.1 there are four new distance specifiers: near16, near32,
far16, and far32.
<P>
A near pointer consists of an offset. A near16 pointer is a near pointer
that consists of a 16 bit offset. A near32 pointer is a near pointer
consisting of a 32 bit offset. A far pointer is a pointer that consists of
both a segment and an offset. A far16 pointer is a far pointer that
consists of a segment and a 16 bit offset. A far32 pointer is a far pointer
consisting of a segment and a 32 bit offset. Segments are always 16 bits.
Note: near32 and far32 pointers are only available on 386 and successive
processors.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The properties of the new distance specifiers are summarized by the
following table:

  -------    ------------    -----------------    -----------
  near16       16 bits           offset_16            IP

  far16        32 bits       segment:offset_16       CS:IP
  far32        48 bits       segment:offset_32       CS:EIP
