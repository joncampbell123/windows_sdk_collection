The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Macro Assembler for MS-DOS, version 6.0
<LI>Microsoft Macro Assembler for OS/2, version 6.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM) version 6.0 will incorrectly parse a
comment as if it were a conditional-assembly directive if the following
conditions are met:

<OL><P><LI>There is a conditional-assembly directive (or word that is the
   same as a conditional directive) inside a comment block that
   does not directly follow the delimiter character and is the
   first thing on the line.

<P><LI>The comment block itself is contained in a conditional-assembly
   block, which will NOT be evaluated by the assembler.
<P>
</OL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When both of these conditions are true, the conditional-assembly directive
is given precedence over the comment block. The conditional directive is
treated as a keyword although it was not meant to be treated as such.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around the problem, make sure that the first word on the line
inside the comment block is not the same as a conditional directive. For
example, in the sample code, one solution is to change the line "If should
be ignored in a comment" to "An if should be ignored in a comment."
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in MASM version 6.0. This
problem was corrected in MASM version 6.0a.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If the conditional-assembly directive is either IF, IFE, IFB, IFNB,
IFDEF, IFNDEF, IFIDN, or IFDIF and there is no associated ENDIF at the
beginning of another line, then the following errors will be
generated:
<P>
<PRE>   error A2088 : END directive required at end of file
   fatal error : A1010 : unmatched block nesting : if-else

</PRE></OL>If the conditional-assembly directive is ELSE, then the following
error is generated:
<P>
<PRE>   error A2008 : syntax error : &lt;the text following the ELSE&gt;

</PRE>If the conditional-assembly directive is ELSEIF, then the following
errors are generated:
<P>
<PRE>   error A2008 : syntax error
   error A2081 : missing operand after unary operator

</PRE>If the conditional-assembly directive is ENDIF, then the following
errors are generated
<P>
<PRE>   error A2008 : syntax error
   error A2044 : invalid character in file

</PRE>where the invalid character referred to is the closing delimiter.
<P>
The sample code below illustrates this problem. It meets the above
conditions, so it is parsed incorrectly and the following errors are
generated:
<P>
<PRE>   error A2088 : END directive required at end of file
   fatal error : A1010 : unmatched block nesting : if-else
