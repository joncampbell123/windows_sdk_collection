<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM) versions 5.0, 5.1, 5.1a, 6.0,
6.0a, and 6.0b allow you to specify the huge memory model by using
the ".model huge" directive. However, this is essentially the same as
specifying the large memory model with ".model large". The actual
handling of huge arrays must be performed by the programmer.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Huge model is provided for code documentation and consistency with
high-level languages. The symbol @DataSize is defined as 1 under the
large model and as 2 under the huge model. Also, under MASM 6.0,
@Model is defined as 5 under large model and as 6 under huge model.
<P>
Pages 84 and 85 of the "Microsoft Macro Assembler Programmer's Guide"
for MASM versions 5.0 and 5.1 describes the memory models that are
used by Microsoft high-level languages. Huge model is described as a
model where:
<P>
<PRE>   Both code and data may be greater than 64K. In addition, data
   arrays may be larger than 64K. Both code and data are far, and
   pointers to elements within an array must also be far. Segments are
   the same for large and huge models.

</PRE>Page 41 of the "Microsoft Macro Assembler Programmer's Guide" shipped
with MASM version 6.0 discusses the limitations of huge model in
assembly language:
<P>
<PRE>   Huge model implies individual data items larger than a single
   segment, but the implementation of huge data items must be coded by
   the programmer. Since the assembler provides no direct support for
   this feature, huge model is essentially the same as large model.

</PRE>The two sample programs below demonstrate the creation of a huge array
and how to handle incrementing a pointer to the array under MS-DOS and
OS/2. The MS-DOS program allocates a huge data item of 100000 bytes and
loads every 10000th (ten-thousandth) element into the DL register. The
OS/2 program allocates a huge data item and sets every 10000th element
to 1. Viewing the execution in CodeView provides the best
understanding of the process.
<P>
The following are the basic steps used in the sample programs:

<OL><P><LI>MS-DOS: Statically declare multiple, adjacent segments using full
   segment declarations. This example needs one full 64K segment and
   another segment for the remainder of the 10000 bytes. The huge
   array has been declared in two portions. These portions can be
   treated as a single array. (To do dynamic allocation instead, use
<PRE>   int 21h function 48h to request a block the desired size and
   receive a pointer to the beginning of the allocated area).

   OS/2: Use the function DosAllocHuge() to dynamically allocate a
   huge array. (To do static allocation instead, use multiple,
   adjacent segments using full segment declarations as in the DOS
   example).

</PRE><P><LI>The segment and offset of the first element are placed in ES and
   BX, respectively.

<P><LI>When the offset is incremented to advance to another element, the
   program must handle the case where it wraps at the end of a
   segment. That is, when the offset value exceeds FFFFh.
<P>
   MS-DOS: The segment must be incremented by 4096 when addition to the
   offset sets the carry flag. The 16-bit segment is shifted 4 bits
   and added to the 16-bit offset to produce a 20-bit address. The
   maximum value that the 16-bit offset can hold is FFFFh. When the
   offset wraps, the carry should be added to the bit of the segment
   that would line up with the 17th bit of the true 20-bit address.
   This is bit 12 of the segment. Since 2 to the power of 12 is
   4096, you add 4096 to the segment when the offset wraps.
<P>
   OS/2: The segment register is actually a selector into a descriptor
   table. The descriptor contains segment access rights, the segment
   base address, and the segment limit. The physical address is
   computed from the segment base address and the offset. Since you do
   not have access to the actual address, you cannot modify bit 17
   when the offset overflows. Therefore, OS/2 provides a mechanism to
   get a new selector to the next segment: the DosGetHugeShift() API
   function. You shift the number 1 left by the value returned from
   DosGetHugeShift() in order to get the amount of the increment for
   subsequent selectors. That increment amount added to the original
   selector value will give you the selector for the segment that
   contains the rest of the array. (For further details, see page 128
   of the Microsoft Press book "Inside OS/2" by Gordon Letwin.)
