  I. IMPORTANT ERGONOMIC SAFETY INFORMATION

  *******************************************************************
  * Some studies suggest that long periods of repetitive motion,    *
  * coupled with an improper work environment and incorrect work    *
  * habits, may be linked to certain types of physical discomfort   *
  * or injury. These include carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS),          *
  * tendinitis, and tenosynovitis. It is important to follow all    *
  * instructions carefully. Failure to do so may result in CTS,     *
  * tendinitis, or tenosynovitis. These instructions may not only   *
  * help minimize your chances of experiencing one of these         *
  * conditions, but will also help you to work more comfortably     *
  * and effectively. Ensuring that your chair, work surface, and    *
  * the placement of the mouse are in the correct positions is      *
  * important. In addition, you should take frequent breaks to      *
  * avoid sitting in the same position for extended periods of      *
  * time. See the end of this README for more important ergonomic   *
  * information.                                                    *

  II. THE MICROSOFT INTELLIPOINT SETUP PROGRAM

  1. Modifications to Your System

  The following changes are made to your system if you set up the
  software using all the default conditions during the IntelliPoint
  Setup program (default directory is c:\msinput). Future installations
  of Microsoft input devices will be installed to the msinput directory.

  A. For the mouse driver in MS-DOS, Setup makes the following changes:

     1. Installs or modifies lines similar to the following in
        AUTOEXEC.BAT:

        SET MSINPUT=C:\MSINPUT
        C:\MSINPUT\MOUSE\MOUSE.EXE /Q


     2. Removes the following line (if it exists) from CONFIG.SYS:

        device=c:\mouse.sys

  B. For the mouse driver in Windows, Setup makes the following changes:

     1. Adds the following line to the load line in WIN.INI:

        [windows] section     load=c:\msinput\pointer.exe

     2. Modifies the following lines in SYSTEM.INI:

        [boot] section               mouse.drv=c:\msinput\msinput.drv
        [boot.description] section   mouse.drv=Microsoft IntelliPoint
                                     version 1.0
        [386enh] section             keyboard=c:\msinput\msinput.386

     3. Adds a group to PROGMAN.INI:

        groupN=c:\windows\MicrosoX.grp
        (where N = next available group number, and where
        X = next available letter or number)

     4. Setup updates to the latest CTL3DV2.DLL file to the
        Windows System directory (if it's not already there).



  2. Returning Your System to Pre-Setup Condition

  To return your system to its previous condition before you
  ran the mouse Setup program, make the following modifications:

  A. If there are no other Microsoft input devices installed, then
     remove the following information from the load= line in the
     WIN.INI:

     c:\msinput\pointer.exe

  Do not remove this value or any other values for this setting if
  there are other Microsoft input devices installed (such as the
  Microsoft Natural Keyboard).

  B. Change the following lines in SYSTEM.INI to read:

     [boot] section               mouse.drv=mouse.drv
     [boot.description] section   mouse.drv=Microsoft, or IBM PS/2

  C. If there are no other Microsoft input devices installed, edit
     the following value in the SYSTEM.INI file so it reads:

     [386enh] section             keyboard=*vkd



  3. Setting up with a Floppy Disk System

  IntelliPoint windows Setup supports only hard disk systems.
  MS-DOS setup supports both hard disk systems and floppy disk
  systems with two drives. If you are installing files onto a
  floppy disk system that has only one drive, you must decompress
  and copy the files manually. EXPAND.EXE, a file-decompression
  program, is provided on the Setup disk for this purpose.

  To install using a single-drive floppy disk system:

  A. Insert the Setup disk into drive A: and type:

     expand mouse.ex_ b:mouse.exe

  B. When prompted by MS-DOS, remove the Setup disk and insert
     your destination disk.

  C. Reinsert the Setup disk in the drive and type:

     expand mbpcpl.ex_ b:mousecpl.exe

  D. When prompted by MS-DOS, remove the Setup disk and
     insert your destination disk.

  To load your mouse driver, type:

      mouse

  Run IntelliPoint Tools &amp; Controls to set pointer options, if desired.
  To run IntelliPoint Tools &amp; Controls, type:

      mousecpl

  If you install the MS-DOS software using a dual floppy disk system,
  set up from drive B: to drive A:.



  4. If you boot from a Floppy Disk

  When you install IntelliPoint software, Setup modifies the
  AUTOEXEC.BAT file located on your default hard drive (normally C:).
  If you boot Microsoft Windows from a floppy disk, you will have to
  copy the two lines of information that were added to the AUTOEXEC.BAT
  file located on your boot disk manually. The two lines are:

     SET MSINPUT=C:\MSINPUT
     C:\MSINPUT\MOUSE\MOUSE.EXE /Q

  (The target directory will be different if you installed
  IntelliPoint software in a different directory.)


  5. Loading MOUSE.EXE into Upper Memory

  The MS-DOS mouse driver automatically loads itself into
  upper memory, if available. Using the MS-DOS loadhigh command
  may cause your mouse software to load into low memory.


</PRE>_________________________________________________________________
<P>
<PRE>  III. THE MOUSEPWR FEATURE

  Some laptop computers have the capability to go into a sleep mode
  to conserve power when not being used.  Choose the MOUSEPWR feature in
  Custom Setup if your mouse becomes erratic after you resume from sleep
  mode. MOUSEPWR restores pre-sleep mode settings of the mouse when you
  resume work on the laptop.

  It's not necessary to use MOUSEPWR if your system has Advanced
  Power Management (APM). However, this feature requires very
  little memory (928 bytes) and won't conflict with APM if both
  are loaded on your system.


</PRE>____________________________________________________________________
<P>
<PRE>  IV. USING COMMAND-LINE SWITCHES IN MS-DOS

  If you are using the MS-DOS version of the software, you can type

  mouse.exe /?

  at the prompt to see a list of available switches.

</PRE>____________________________________________________________________
<P>
<PRE>  V. MICROSOFT WINDOWS NT SUPPORT FOR YOUR MOUSE

  Microsoft Windows NT has Microsoft mouse drivers included.
  For additional mouse support for Microsoft Windows NT, contact
  Microsoft Customer Service. Inside the U.S.A., call 1-800-426-9400.
  Outside the U.S.A., please contact your subsidiary.

</PRE>____________________________________________________________________
<P>
<P>
<PRE>  VI. NOTES ON INTELLIPOINT TOOLS &amp; CONTROLS FEATURES

  1. MS-DOS and Windows Features

  When you choose Set Buttons, Pointer Speed, Acceleration,
  and Orientation from IntelliPoint Tools &amp; Controls in Windows, the
  changes do not affect the MS-DOS driver until you reboot your computer.
  However, if you set these features from the IntelliPoint Tools &amp;
  Controls in MS-DOS, the changes affect both MS-DOS and Windows.

  2. Pointer Wrap

  Pointer Wrap cannot move off the edge of the screen while
  Microsoft Windows is busy (for example, while the pointer
  is an hour glass).

  3. Snap-to

  If you encounter a dialog box in which the focus returns to the
  default button after each individual action (such as, selecting
  custom options during Setup), disable the Snap-to feature on the
  Activity tab until you finish the current operation.

  If Snap-to does not work in some dialog boxes, it is because
  the default buttons in these dialog boxes do not adhere to the
  standard Microsoft Windows user interface specifications for
  default buttons.

  4. Trails

  You can not adjust the length of Pointer Trails for Paletized
  video drivers through IntelliPoint Tools &amp; Controls.

  5.  Magnify

  If the Magnify with Cursor Position does not work in some applications,
  it is because the application is not using the default Windows system
  Insertion Point (such as in Microsoft Word for Windows).

  6.  Vanish

  If Vanish does not cause the cursor to disappear, it is because
  some video drivers may not support this feature.

</PRE>_____________________________________________________________________
<P>
<PRE>  VII.  Using IntelliPoint software with a Portable Pointing Device

  If an external pointing device is connected to your computer,
  the mouse driver will not work with the integrated pointing device.

  You should disconnect the external pointing device before using
  the mouse driver with the integrated pointing device.

  Changing Integrated Pointing Device Port Configuration

  If your computer provides a configuration utility to change system
  settings such as settings for the internal clock and for port
  assignments, you can use this program to change the serial port
  assigned for your portable pointing device. If you change the port
  assignment with this utility, you must also add or modify the
  EmbeddedType= line in MOUSE.INI.

  The default setting for EmbeddedType= is as follows, showing that you
  are using the Mouse Port (PS\2) for your portable pointing device:

  EmbeddedType=PS2

  So, for example, if you change the port for your portable pointing
  device to COM1, you would change this line as follows:

  EmbeddedType=SERIAL1

  Note: The Microsoft IntelliPoint software does not support
  non-standard interrupt (IRQ) settings. Standard IRQ settings are
  as follows:

  For use with COM1 (SERIAL1) -- IRQ4
  For use with COM2 (SERIAL2) -- IRQ3

  Note IntelliPoint software supports only 100% Microsoft Mouse
  compatible pointing devices.
  _____________________________________________________________________

  VIII. OTHER ISSUES

  1. Hot Keys on LCD Screens

  On some LCD screens, some of the hot keys may not appear or are
  not highlighted.


  2. Large and Medium Pointers

  When using a large or medium sized pointer, some MS-DOS
  applications may not redraw the pointer correctly, resulting
  in "mouse droppings."

  When using a large or medium sized pointer, pointers in some
  applications may be distorted.  This is due to the method
  used to enlarge the pointer.


  3. Using the IntelliPoint Toolbar with Central Point PC Tools
  for Windows

  If you run any version of Central Point PC Tools for Windows, you
  may find that the Hide Title Bar feature in IntelliPoint Toolbar is
  not available.

  4. Using the Sound feature in Special Effects

  If an IntelliPoint sound continues after you've finished your
  task you may be experiencing an interrupt conflict. You can
  disable IntelliPoint sound or change your sound card interrupt
  setting to resolve this problem.

  5. Using MS-DOS Disk Caching software during Setup

  If you use an MS-DOS disk caching software other than Microsoft
  SMARTDrive, don't choose Reboot after completing Setup. Choose Exit,
  then exit Windows and reboot your machine manually.

  Some DOS disk caching programs use a write behind caching technique.
  If the cache isn't flushed before rebooting, disk errors may occur.


  ___________________________________________________________________

  VIII. MORE ERGONOMIC INFORMATION

  Personalizing your environment so that it is comfortable for your work
  situation promotes a healthy physical and mental lifestyle. Studies
  show that a carefully planned work environment can actually increase
  productivity. Of course, only you can judge what's best for you, so
  we encourage you to adapt these tips to your own needs.

  Exercises

  Exercise and frequent breaks play an important part in staying alert
  and comfortable on the job. Take periodic breaks to rest your eyes,
  move your body, and get your circulation flowing. Try some of the
  following exercises several times during the day.

  Gently press your hands against a table, stretch, and hold for five
  seconds. Stretch and massage your fingers, hands, wrists, and forearms
  throughout the day. Gently shake your hands and fingers to relieve
  tension and help blood flow. Rotate your shoulders in a full forward
  circle four times. Then roll them backward four times. Then rotate
  each shoulder separately four times. Do this at least twice daily.
  Organize your work so that you alternate using your computer with
  other activities. Try to use different muscle groups throughout the
  day. Get up and walk around several times a day.

  Note:  If you experience pain while using your computer, consult a
  qualified health professional.

  Chair and Desk

  A chair that is adjustable in height is a good place to start. It
  should be comfortable and provide firm support to the lower back
  (lumbar region). Adjust the chair so that your forearms form
  approximate right angles with your upper arms and so that your
  feet rest flat on the floor. If your feet don't rest flat on the
  floor, use a footrest that is high enough so that your thighs
  are about parallel to the floor while you're seated.

  If at all possible, place your system on a desk designed for a
  computer. Traditional writing desks are sometimes too high for
  computer use. A proper height between your chair and your desk
  is essential. And don't forget good posture -- slouching puts
  unnecessary strain on your back and weakens muscles.

  Display and Lighting

  Place the display screen directly in front of you at a comfortable
  viewing distance. Sit in your chair and make sure that the top of
  the display is no higher than eye level. Make sure you can't see
  glare and bright reflections on the screen (anti-glare filters help)
  or on your mouse, and keep your screen clean and dust free.

  It's important to look away from your display frequently. Several
  times every hour, focus on an object about 20 feet away and slowly
  inhale through your nose and exhale through your mouth.

  Keyboard and Mouse

  Position the keyboard directly in front of you on the desk. While
  you're typing and using the mouse, keep your shoulders relaxed and
  let your upper arms hang freely at your sides. Let your elbows hang
  loosely near your body and allow enough room on your desk for
  unhindered movement of the mouse. Your forearms should be nearly
  parallel to the floor as you type
  and use the mouse.

  Position the mouse at the same height as your keyboard. If you can,
  try to avoid light sources that can reflect on the surfaces of your
  mouse and keyboard. Use your entire arm to move the mouse around
  on your desktop whenever possible. The Microsoft Mouse is designed
  so that you can rest your hand on it whenever possible, and so that
  you don't have to grip it unusually hard when using it. Avoid
  excessive tension in your hand by relaxing -- don't pinch the
  mouse too hard.

  The high-performance level of the Microsoft Mouse makes it
  unnecessary to use a mouse pad. However, if you do use a mouse
  pad, make sure it is not so thick that it raises your arm and
  the mouse. Your arm should maintain an approximate right angle
  to the horizontal table top. The mouse pad should provide smooth
  friction for ease of use -- it should not be too slippery. It
  should also be lint free so the mouse ball doesn't get dirty.

  The design of the Microsoft Mouse accommodates a wide variety
  of grips and lets you use the mouse in either hand. The mouse
  allows for several possible work positions, which can help you
  avoid unnecessary strain on your arms and hands. By periodically
  varying the way you hold the mouse, you don't repeat the same
  motion over a long period of time. The software that comes with
  the Microsoft Mouse (IntelliPoint Tools &amp; Controls) supports the
  mouse design by letting you customize the software for variable
  work positions. It's a good idea to periodically readjust your
  software as you get better acquainted with your mouse.
