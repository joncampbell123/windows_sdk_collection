The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft BallPoint Mouse version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft BallPoint mouse does not work on a Grid 1660 Notebook
computer when connected to the mouse port. Grid has confirmed the
design of its model 1660 uses a proprietary controller chip for the
PS/2-style port and that the BallPoint mouse does not function
correctly on this port.
<P>
To work around this problem, connect the BallPoint mouse to a serial
port or use a serial mouse on the serial port.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the BallPoint mouse connected to the mouse port, the
driver loads but the pointer does not move. It remains frozen on the
screen, however, the computer does not stop responding (hang). This
problem happens in both MS-DOS and Windows 3.1.
<P>
Grid has also confirmed that you may experience some erratic behavior
if you use the standard Serial-PS/2 Microsoft Mouse on the PS/2-style
port on a system that has up to 2 megabytes (MB) of RAM installed. If
more than 2 MB are installed on your machine, none of the Microsoft
mice work on the PS/2-style port.
<P>
Grid has confirmed this to be a problem with the 1660. For more
information, call Grid Technical Support at (800) 654-4743.
