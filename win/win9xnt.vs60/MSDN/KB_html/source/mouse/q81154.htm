The Puzzle Pad is a wrist-support pad and a mouse pad that connect in
a puzzle-like fashion, hence the name Puzzle Pad. The pad comes in
different colors and is about 3/4 of an inch high.
<P>
Due to the height of the Puzzle Pad, you may tend to pick up your
Microsoft Mouse while you are rolling it. This causes the Microsoft
Mouse to get "stuck" on the screen even though you are rolling it on
the Puzzle Pad. This is not a problem with your Microsoft Mouse.
<P>
To prevent this behavior, make sure you hold the Microsoft Mouse flat
on the Puzzle Pad; if you lift up or tilt the Microsoft Mouse while
you are moving it, the ball loses contact with the Puzzle Pad, making
the mouse appear to be stuck. This information applies to all mouse
pads.
<P>
The Puzzle Pad is manufactured by a vendor independent of Microsoft; we
make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
performance or reliability.
