The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mouse driver for MS-DOS, versions 6.x, 7.x, 8.x, and 9.0
<LI>Microsoft Mouse driver for Windows, versions 8.x and 9.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When the Microsoft Mouse driver is loaded, it looks for an attached
mouse in a certain order. This order differs in MS-DOS and Microsoft
Windows and also may differ depending on the version of the mouse
software you are using.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes the search order used in both MS-DOS-based and
Windows-based systems. The information is arranged as follows:

<UL><LI>MS-DOS-based systems using mouse driver version 8.2 or earlier

<LI>MS-DOS-based systems using mouse driver version 9.0

<LI>Windows-based systems using mouse driver version 8.2 or earlier

<LI>Windows-based systems using mouse driver version 9.0
<P>
</UL>More Information:
<P>
<P><h3>MS-DOS-Based Systems Using Mouse Driver Version 8.2 or Earlier</h3>
 
<P>
If you are using version 8.2 or earlier, the Microsoft Mouse software
searches in MS-DOS-based systems as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   MOUSE.INI (DeviceType= line)
   InPort1
   InPort2
   Bus
   PS/2
   Serial COM1
   Serial COM2

</PRE>Note: If you force the Microsoft Mouse software to install to a
certain port, it looks only at that port UNLESS it is the PS/2 port.
If you force the Microsoft Mouse software to install to the PS/2 port
by typing the following or putting it in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file
<P>
<PRE>   c:\mouse&gt; mouse /z

</PRE>the software starts the search at the PS/2 port but then looks at COM1
and then COM2 if it does not find the Microsoft Mouse on the PS/2
port.
<P>
<P><h3>MS-DOS-Based Systems Using Mouse Driver Version 9.0</h3>
 
<P>
If you are using version 9.0, the Microsoft Mouse software searches in
MS-DOS-based systems as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   MOUSE.INI (DeviceType= line)
   PS/2
   Serial COM1
   Serial COM2
   InPort1
   InPort2
   Bus

</PRE><h3>Windows-Based Systems Using Mouse Driver Version 8.2 or Earlier</h3>
 
<P>
If you are using version 8.2 or earlier, the Microsoft Mouse software
searches in Windows-based systems as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   MOUSE.INI (DeviceType= line)
   MS-DOS driver function 36
   InPort1
   InPort2
   Bus
   PS/2
   Serial COM2
   Serial COM1

</PRE>Note: If you force Windows to find the Microsoft Mouse through the
MOUSE.INI file, it looks only at the port specified UNLESS you specify
the following in the MOUSE.INI file:
<P>
<PRE>   MouseType=PS2

</PRE>In this case, the Microsoft Mouse software searches the PS/2 port,
then COM2, then COM1 if no Microsoft Mouse is found on the PS/2 port.
<P>
Because of the different search sequences, the Microsoft Mouse may
work in MS-DOS but not in Windows. If this is the case, use the
MOUSE.INI file to force Windows to find the Microsoft Mouse. If that
option is not available, put the Microsoft Mouse on the port that
Windows finds it on and then force the Microsoft Mouse to be found in
MS-DOS by using command-line switches.
<P>
<P><h3>Windows-Based Systems Using Mouse Driver Version 9.0</h3>
 
<P>
If you are using version 9.0, the Microsoft Mouse software searches in
Windows-based systems as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   MOUSE.INI (DeviceType= line)
   PS/2
   Serial COM2
   Serial COM1
   InPort1
   InPort2
   Bus
</PRE>
