The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mouse Driver for MS-DOS, versions 7.x, 8.x, and 9.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The buttons for the Microsoft Mouse cannot be swapped using MOUSE.COM
versions earlier than 8.20 in either the MOUSE.INI settings or the
command line switches for Button Selection. The capability to reassign
the mouse buttons is supported by the BallPoint Mouse in all versions
of the BallPoint Mouse software. Driver versions 8.20a and later allow
both the Microsoft Mouse and the BallPoint Mouse to swap the mouse
buttons.
<P>
This information applies to Microsoft Mouse driver version 8.20a and
later, and to all versions of the Microsoft BallPoint Mouse for MS-DOS
systems.
<P>
This does not apply to Windows. All version of the Windows mouse driver
have the capability to swap the mouse buttons via the Control Panel.
This only affects Windows applications, not MS-DOS applications.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The "Microsoft Mouse User's Guide" (Appendix A) refers to command line
switches and MOUSE.INI settings for Button Selection. This section of
the manual is incorrect, because the "Primary" and "Secondary" lines
may be partially printed in black. The whole section describing Button
Selection should be printed in blue, indicating that this feature only
applies to the BallPoint Mouse. Also, the sections titled "Rotation
Angle" and "Button Selection" in Appendix A of the "Microsoft Mouse
User's Guide" only apply to the BallPoint Mouse.
<P>
The command line switch /KP3S1 for MOUSE.COM does not change the
button functionality of the Microsoft Mouse, but does change the
button functionality of the Microsoft BallPoint.
<P>
Similarly, the PrimaryButton=3 and SecondaryButton=1 settings in the
MOUSE.INI do not switch the Microsoft Mouse buttons, but do switch the
Microsoft BallPoint buttons.
