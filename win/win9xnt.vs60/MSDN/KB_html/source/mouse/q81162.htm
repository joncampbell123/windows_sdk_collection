The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mouse Driver for MS-DOS, versions 6.x, 7.x, 8.x,
   and 9.0
<LI>Microsoft Mouse Driver for Windows, version 9.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If the primary button on your Microsoft Mouse won't double-click in
Windows, try changing the double-click speed or swapping the primary and
secondary buttons.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If your Microsoft Mouse primary button does not seem to be
functioning, open the Mouse Control Panel and move the double-click
speed bar so that it is on the slowest double-click speed possible.
<P>
If that does not help, switch the mouse buttons in the Windows Control
Panel to see if the same symptoms occur with the other mouse button
set as the primary button. When the buttons are switched, the right
button behaves as the left button does normally.
<P>
If the problem is severe enough that you cannot open the Windows
Control Panel with the mouse, you can use the keyboard to open it. To
do this, use the following steps (if you have driver version 8.0 or
later, similar steps should be used to open the Mouse Control Panel):

<OL><P><LI>Press ALT+W to open the Program Manager Window menu.

<P><LI>Using the arrow keys, select Main from the list of groups and press
   ENTER. (Note that Control Panel is in the Main group by default.)

<P><LI>Use the arrow keys to select the Control Panel icon and press ENTER
   to open it.

<P><LI>With the arrow keys, move to the Mouse icon and press ENTER to
   start the Mouse Control Panel.

<P><LI>Press TAB to switch the setting of the Swap Left/Right Buttons
   check box and press the SPACEBAR to activate it, or press ALT+S to
   activate the Swap option.
<P>
</OL>If driver version 8.0 or later is being used, from the Mouse Control
Panel, choose the Buttons button. You will be prompted to press and
release the primary mouse button. Press and release the right mouse
button instead of the left button.
<P>
With this option activated, try to use the Microsoft Mouse with the
buttons swapped (that is, double-click the right button on an icon).
If the right button works properly, the left button is probably
defective and you should call Microsoft Sales Information Center (MSIC) at
(800) 426-9400 to get it repaired. However, if the right button also does
not work, take your Microsoft Mouse to another machine that has a working
Microsoft Mouse on it (if one is available). Turn off the machine, unplug
the working mouse and plug in the suspect Microsoft Mouse. Turn the machine
on to see if the suspect Microsoft Mouse now works. The left button should
be the primary button and you should be able to use it for double-clicking
icons in Windows. If it does work, there may be a software conflict or a
port problem on the other machine. If it does not work,  call Microsoft
Sales Information Center (MSIC) for information on how to return your
Microsoft Mouse for repair.
<P>
NOTE: Depending on which version of the Microsoft Mouse driver you are
using, you may have two separate Mouse Control Panels. One called the
"Windows Control Panel" is found by default under the Main group. The
other one is the "Mouse" or "BallPoint Mouse" control panel; these are
put into their own groups. If you have two control panels, try adjusting
the double-click speed in both to make sure they are consistent.
