The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mouse Driver for Windows, version 8.20a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you install the Microsoft Mouse driver version 8.20a for Windows,
the mouse option in the Control Panel is reconfigured.
<P>
This information applies to all versions of the Microsoft Mouse using
Microsoft Mouse driver version 8.20a with Microsoft Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Windows comes with a mouse option in the Control Panel that
allows adjustments to be made for the mouse.
<P>
When you install the Microsoft Mouse 8.2a software, the Setup program
creates a Microsoft Mouse group and reconfigures the mouse option in
the Control Panel so that it includes additional features.
<P>
The file that is reconfiguring the mouse option in the Control Panel
is POINTLIB.DLL. By simply renaming or deleting this file, the mouse
option in the Control Panel reverts back to its original configuration.
This will also prevent you from accessing the new Microsoft Mouse
Control Panel found in the Microsoft Mouse group.
<P>
Depending on how you run Setup, the POINTLIB.DLL file is found in one of
two places: the \MOUSE directory or the \WINDOWS directory. If you
installed for MS-DOS and Windows, the POINTLIB.DLL file is in the \MOUSE
directory. If you installed only for Windows, the POINTLIB.DLL file is
in the \WINDOWS directory.
<P>
If you delete or rename the POINTLIB.DLL file and find that the mouse
option in the Control Panel still contains the additional 8.2a
features, then there is likely a PATH or SET statement pointing to a
directory that also contains the POINTLIB.DLL file. Simply remove the
reference, or rename or remove POINTLIB.DLL.
