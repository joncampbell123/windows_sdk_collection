</UL> 
<P>
Microsoft has an Application Note titled "Programming the Microsoft Mouse
under MS-DOS" (HD1008) that provides instructions and background
information you can use when programming the Microsoft Mouse. This
Application Note defines all mouse functions and covers basic requirements
of all mouse aware applications and supported video modes.
<P>
You can access Microsoft Mouse functions through software Interrupt 33h. To
program the mouse, your program must directly manipulate the hardware
registers AX, BX, CX, and DX. You can do this with assembly language, C,
Pascal, Basic, or FORTRAN. Each language has its own method of interfacing
with the hardware registers; check your compiler's directions for
instructions when you are manipulating registers in these languages.
