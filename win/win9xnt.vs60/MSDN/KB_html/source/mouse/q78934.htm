The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mouse Driver for MS-DOS, versions 8.x
<LI>Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Mouse driver Setup program has an option for installing for both MS-
DOS and Windows. You must have Windows 3.0 properly installed before you
can install the Mouse Setup for MS-DOS and Windows 3.0.
<P>
This information applies to all versions of the Microsoft Mouse and
Microsoft Mouse driver versions 8.0 and 8.1 for MS-DOS based systems.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Mouse driver Setup gives you a choice of installing for MS-DOS, or for
both MS-DOS and Windows 3.0. If you choose to install for both, you
will be prompted for the drive and directory where Windows 3.0 is
installed.
<P>
The Mouse driver Setup program will then check the directory you
specified as the Windows directory for the presence of the following
files:
<P>
<PRE>   SYSTEM.INI
   PROGMAN.INI
   WINVER.EXE

</PRE>If any of the above files are not in the specified Windows 3.0
directory, the following error message will be displayed:
<P>
<PRE>   Setup could not locate Windows 3.0 in the directory you
   specified.

</PRE>You will then be given two choices:
<P>
<PRE>   Re-enter the Windows 3.0 drive and directory.
   Install for DOS only.

</PRE>Choose to install for MS-DOS only. Once you are done with the Mouse
driver Setup program, verify that you have the directory for Windows
3.0 you specified. If the directory is there, verify that it is not
empty. If you do not have a Windows directory, or it is empty, you
must run the Windows 3.0 Setup. After you set up Windows, run the
Mouse driver Setup for both MS-DOS and Windows 3.0.
<P>
If the directory is there, and it is not empty, check for the presence
of the three files listed above. If one of these files is missing, you
should contact Microsoft Product Support Services at (425) 637-7098 to
determine the extent of your Windows problems.
