<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.0
<LI>Microsoft Mouse Driver for MS-DOS, versions 7.x and 8.x
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Serial Mouse may not work after you exit Microsoft
Windows version 3.0 if the mouse is connected to a dedicated mouse
port. This information applies to all versions of the Microsoft Serial
Mouse and versions 7.0 through 8.2 of the Microsoft Mouse driver for
MS-DOS.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
If the customer is using PC Tools, try to initialize PCSHELL with a
/PS2 switch as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   pcshell /ps2

</PRE>If this doesn't work, continue with the troubleshooting steps in this
article.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may occur even if the MS-DOS version of the mouse driver
(MOUSE.COM or MOUSE.SYS) is correctly loaded into memory on the
machine. A designated mouse port is reset upon entering a MS-DOS
application. Upon exit, Windows performs a "soft reset," but some
MS-DOS applications require a "hard reset" of the port. Consequently,
the mouse isn't active in such an application even though the mouse
driver software was installed in memory.
<P>
Possible solutions to this problem are as follows:

<OL><P><LI>If you are using the Windows mouse driver version 7.04 (MOUSE.DRV,
   file size 3699 bytes) with PC Tools, call Central Point Software at
   (503) 690-8080 and request the files FIXWIN.BAT and FIXMOUSE.COM.
   These files will generate a hard reset on the mouse port.
<P>
   Note: PC Tools is manufactured by a vendor independent of
   Microsoft. We make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding
   this product's performance or reliability.

<P><LI>If you plug the mouse into the COM1 or COM2 serial port and the
   problem disappears, there may be a problem with the mouse port
   other than specifically the need for a hard reset. If you plug
   the mouse into the COM1 or COM2 serial port and the problem
   persists, continue with the steps below.

<P><LI>In the subdirectory that contains the mouse driver, type "mouse"
   (without quotation marks). The message "Existing mouse driver
   enabled" is displayed. This causes a hard reset of the mouse
   port, and the mouse should then work.

<P><LI>Update your Windows MOUSE.DRV file to version 8.0 (file size 9216
   bytes). This reportedly corrects the problem in most cases, but
   there are known to be exceptions. This file comes on the Microsoft
   Mouse version 8.0 driver update disk. To obtain this disk, call
   Microsoft Sales Information Center (MSIC) at (800) 426-9400.
