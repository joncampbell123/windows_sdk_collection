</PRE><h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
 
<P>
When you start a Win32-based application using Win32s(TM) under
Windows(TM) 3.1 or 3.11 or Windows for Workgroups, you may receive a
general protection (GP) fault in POINTER.DLL caused by the Microsoft
Mouse driver 9.01 GROWSTUB component.
<P>
<P><h2>CORRECTING THE PROBLEM</h2>
 
<P>
To correct this problem, do one of the following:

<UL><LI>Remove POINTER.EXE from the load= line in the WIN.INI file and then
   restart Windows.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Upgrade to the Microsoft Mouse IntelliPoint software version 1.0.
   For information about obtaining this upgrade, call the Microsoft
   Sales Information Center at (800) 426-9400. There is a charge for
   this upgrade.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Install the Microsoft Mouse driver version 9.01b POINTER.DLL file
   included with this Application Note.
<P>
</UL>The 9.01b POINTER.DLL file does not include any new functionality. It
prevents the GP fault by removing some of the software functionality
of the 9.01 driver (such as large pointer size and the Snap-to
feature) when you are using the mouse in a Win32 application. This
version of POINTER.DLL works with the 9.01 driver only; it generates
various error messages when used with other versions.
<P>
<P><h3>To install the 9.01b POINTER.DLL</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Quit Windows or Windows for Workgroups.

<P><LI>Make a backup copy of the currently installed POINTER.DLL file by
   typing the following at the MS-DOS command prompt and then pressing
   ENTER
<P>
<P><PRE>      ren &lt;drive&gt;:&lt;path&gt;\pointer.dll pointer.old
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;drive&gt;:&lt;path&gt; is the location of your Microsoft Mouse files.
<P>
   For example, if your Microsoft Mouse files are installed in your
   C:\WINDOWS directory, type the following at the MS-DOS command
   prompt and then press ENTER:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ren c:\windows\pointer.dll pointer.old
</PRE>
<P><LI>Insert the enclosed HD1061 disk in the appropriate floppy disk
   drive.

<P><LI>To copy the file to the directory containing your Microsoft Mouse
   files, type the following at the MS-DOS command prompt and then
   press ENTER
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy &lt;drive&gt;:\pointer.dll &lt;destination&gt;
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;drive&gt; is the floppy disk drive containing the HD1061 disk
   and &lt;destination&gt; is the drive and directory containing your
   Microsoft Mouse files.
<P>
   For example, if the HD1061 disk is in drive A and your Microsoft
   Mouse files are in C:\WINDOWS, type the following at the MS-DOS
   command prompt and then press ENTER:
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy a:\pointer.dll c:\windows
