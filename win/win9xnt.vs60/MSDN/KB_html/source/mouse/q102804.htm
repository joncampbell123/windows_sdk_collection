The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mouse Driver for MS-DOS, versions 6.x, 7.x, 8.x, and 9.0
<LI>Microsoft InPort Mouse, version 1.x, 2.x
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft no longer sells an extension cable for the InPort (bus)
Microsoft Mouse. The cable for the 2.0 version of the bus version of
the Microsoft Mouse is approximately 1.5 feet shorter than the cable
for the 1.0 version of the Microsoft Mouse.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
There are two methods for extending the length of the mouse cable:

<UL><LI>You can purchase a manufactured extension cable from a cable
   manufacturer or reseller.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>You can build the extension cable.
<P>
</UL>There are resellers who sell extension cables for most types of
cables, including cables for bus mice.
<P>
NOTE: The InPort or bus mouse connector is called a 9-pin Hosiden
connection. The connector may also be called a 9-pin mini-din
connection.
<P>
The vendor below confirmed it offers bus extension cables that work
with bus versions of the Microsoft Mouse:
<P>
<PRE>   Precision Cable and Connector Company
   2983 NW Raleigh St.
   Portland, OR 97210
   Telephone: (503) 222-4323
   Fax:       (503) 223-0656

</PRE>Microsoft is not aware of any special considerations for special
installation, such as alignment to compensate for cable
characteristics, special cable termination (R, RC, and so forth),
needed for line drivers, or noise-immunity considerations.
<P>
WARNING: Changing the mouse cabling may cause the computer to violate
FCC Electromagnetic Interference regulations. The computer may
interfere with nearby television or radio reception. Operation in a
residential environment is especially ill-advised, and such a
configuration CANNOT be offered for sale without extensive testing and
FCC certification.

when modified or used in a manner other than that intended and advised
in the manual. Microsoft assumes the customer complies with all
applicable laws and regulations and offers the above advice only on
that basis.

The products included here are manufactured by vendors independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these
products' performance or reliability.
