The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mouse Driver for MS-DOS, versions 7.x and 8.x
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Using the Microsoft Mouse driver MOUSE.COM versions 7.0 through 8.2
may cause problems with Novell NetWare network software.
<P>
To work around the problem, use MOUSE.SYS, or change the order that
MOUSE.COM is loaded relative to the network software.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Some symptoms of a mouse-network conflict include problems logging on
to the network, no mouse response even after a "Mouse Driver
installed" message, and intermittent machine hangs.
<P>
If the MOUSE.COM file is being loaded before the network software, try
loading it after the network software is loaded. If the network
software is being loaded first, try loading it last. In every case,
make sure that the mouse driver is on the local workstation and not on
a network drive.
<P>
Microsoft does not support using a Microsoft Mouse with Novell
NetWare.  If the above suggestions do not solve the problem, call
Novell NetWare technical support.
<P>
The Novell product included here is manufactured by a vendor independent
of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this
product's performance or reliability.
