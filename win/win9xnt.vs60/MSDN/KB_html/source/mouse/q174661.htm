The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft IntelliMouse version 1.0
<LI>Microsoft IntelliPoint software version 2.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After you install the IntelliPoint software, you may experience any of the
following symptoms:

<UL><LI>The mouse pointer may not respond correct when you move the
   IntelliMouse.

<LI>The mouse pointer may respond, but the wheel may not. Additionally, the
   Wheel options in the Mouse tool in Control Panel may be unavailable.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The PS/2 port on your computer may not be compatible with the
IntelliMouse.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Check Installed Mouse Driver</h3>
 
<P>
There are other possible causes of these symptoms. If the PS/2 port is not
compatible, Windows cannot successfully detect the IntelliMouse. Check
Device Manager to see if the Microsoft Mouse With Wheel device is listed.
To do so, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Press CTRL+ESC to open the Start menu.

<P><LI>Use the ARROW keys to select Settings, and then press ENTER.

<P><LI>Use the ARROW keys to select Control Panel, and then press ENTER.

<P><LI>Use the ARROW keys to select System, and then press ENTER.

<P><LI>Press CTRL+TAB to select the Device Manager tab.

<P><LI>Press TAB twice to get to the device list (Computer should be
   selected).

<P><LI>Use the DOWN ARROW key to select Mouse. If there is a plus sign (+)
   next to Mouse, press the RIGHT ARROW key to expand the Mouse branch.

<P><LI>Check for the Microsoft Mouse With Wheel device.
<P>
</OL>If the Microsoft Mouse With Wheel device is listed, it is likely that the
PS/2 port is compatible with the IntelliMouse. This indicates that you may
have a conflict with software or earlier mouse drivers. For additional
information about a software or driver issue, please see the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : IntelliMouse Wheel Does Not Work Properly

</PRE></OL>If Microsoft Mouse With Wheel is not listed, the most likely cause of the
problem is an incompatible PS/2 port. Follow these steps to correct the
problem:

<OL><P><LI>Shut down Windows, and then turn off your computer.

<P><LI>Unplug your mouse from the PS/2 port.

<P><LI>Use the IntelliMouse serial adapter to connect the mouse to an
   available serial (COM) port. (This adapter is included with the
   IntelliMouse Serial or PS/2 Compatible mouse.)

<P><LI>When you have connected the mouse to the serial port, turn the computer
   back on and start Windows. When Windows starts, you should see the
   following message:
<P>
<P><PRE>      New Hardware Found...mouse with wheel.
</PRE><P>
   This message indicates that the IntelliMouse was successfully detected
   on the serial port.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The adapter included with the IntelliMouse Serial or PS/2 Compatible mouse
is part number 68666. Other mouse adapters may not work correctly with the
IntelliMouse.
