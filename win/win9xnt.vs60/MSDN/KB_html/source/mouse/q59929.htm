The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mouse Driver for MS-DOS, versions 7.x and 8.x
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Msetup and Setup programs that are supplied with the 400 ppi Mouse
(Mouse driver version 7.0 or later) delete any reference to MOUSE.SYS
in the CONFIG.SYS file and changes any reference to MOUSE.COM in the
AUTOEXEC.BAT file.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When Msetup or Setup is used to install a newer version of the
Microsoft Mouse driver, the CONFIG.SYS and the AUTOEXEC.BAT files are
scanned for references to MOUSE.SYS or MOUSE.COM mouse drivers. If any
references are found in the CONFIG.SYS file, they are deleted. Any
that are found in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file are deleted and replaced with
a reference to the new driver. This is done to prevent the loading of
older versions of the mouse driver when the machine is booted.
<P>
In the "Microsoft Mouse User's Guide," in the section titled
"Installing the Mouse Software," it is recommended that you delete the
old version of the mouse driver by installing the new driver in the
same directory where the old driver resides. This will ensure that
only the current mouse driver is in use.
