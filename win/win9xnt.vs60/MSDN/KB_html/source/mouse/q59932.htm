The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mouse Driver for MS-DOS, versions 6.x, 7.x, and 8.x
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Mouse drivers come with mouse menus that provide
simulated mouse support in applications that do not have built-in
mouse support. The names of the menus to use with Lotus 1-2-3 are as
follows:
<P>
<PRE>    1-2-3 Version   Mouse Menu
    -------------   ----------

    1a              MS123.COM
    2.01            MS123-1.COM
    2.2             MS123-2.COM
    3.0             MS123-3.COM

</PRE>To use a mouse menu with Lotus 1-2-3, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>At the command prompt, type "mouse" (without the quotation marks)
   to load the Microsoft Mouse driver.

<P><LI>Load the appropriate mouse menu by typing the name of the menu
   (for example, "MS123").

<P><LI>At the command prompt, type "123" (without the quotation marks) to
   start Lotus 1-2-3.
<P>
</OL>Note: Each of the above steps might require you to change to the
directory that the relative files are in.
<P>
This information applies to the Microsoft Mouse Driver for MS-DOS,
versions 6.24b and later.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Testing of the various versions of Lotus 1-2-3 with each of the
available MS123 mouse menus and with either the version 6.24b or
version 7.0 mouse driver yield the following results:
<P>
<PRE>   1-2-3     | MS123       MS123-1     MS123-2     MS123-3
   Version   | 6.24b/later 6.24b/later 6.24b/later 6.24b/later
   ----------|-----------------------------------------------
     1A      |   yes/yes     yes/yes     yes/yes     yes/yes
             |     */*                                  /**
             |
     2.01    |   yes/yes     yes/yes     yes/yes     yes/yes
             |     */                       /**       **/**
             |
     2.2     |   yes/yes     yes/yes     yes/yes     yes/yes
             |     */*                                 */*
             |
     3.0     |    no/no       no/no       no/no      yes/yes
             |               ***/***     ***/***      **/**

Notes: *   No mouse action on Master screen.
       **  No side bar menu.
       *** Cursor moves with mouse but no menu action.

</PRE></OL><h3>Summary of Normal Mouse Action (Yes in Above Chart)</h3>
 
<P>
Usually, the mouse works in one of two ways: either the selected block
moves around with the mouse movements, or a separate mouse cursor is
on the screen and the selected block moves to the mouse cursor
position upon clicking the left mouse button.
<P>
In most cases, clicking the left mouse button activates a side bar
menu with options such as PAGE UP, PAGE DOWN, PAGE LEFT, PAGE RIGHT,
HOME, END, and ARROW key functions, and sometimes more (depending on
the version of the menu).
<P>
Also, in most cases, clicking the right mouse menu does the same as
pressing the forward slash (/) key to bring up the standard 1-2-3
menu. Moving the mouse changes the highlighted command. The right
mouse button acts as an ENTER key. Clicking both buttons will return
the mouse to the spreadsheet.
