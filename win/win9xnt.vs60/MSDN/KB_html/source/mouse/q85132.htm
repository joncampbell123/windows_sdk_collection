</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If you are using MOUSE.SYS version 8.2 or 8.2a as the Microsoft mouse
driver, the MOUSE.INI file must reside in the same directory for
settings to be retrieved. If you are using MOUSE.SYS version 8.0 or 8.1
as the mouse driver, then MOUSE.INI isn't read regardless of its
location.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
MOUSE.INI is a file designed to save mouse settings, beginning with
mouse driver 8.0. If make a change to your mouse settings (for example,
increase the pointer size), the change is saved in the MOUSE.INI file.
The next time you start the computer, the change is retrieved. The
Microsoft mouse driver MOUSE.COM looks to an environment variable to
find the location of MOUSE.INI.
<P>
If you are using MOUSE.SYS instead of MOUSE.COM, the environment
variable is set up after the CONFIG.SYS file is processed. Because of
this, MOUSE.SYS 8.2 or 8.2a doesn't know where to find MOUSE.INI, so it
assumes that it is in the same directory where MOUSE.SYS resides. If you
are running MOUSE.SYS version 8.0 or 8.1, MOUSE.INI is never read, so
permanent changes cannot be made.
<P>
To avoid this situation, MOUSE.INI should be in the same directory as
MOUSE.SYS, or you should use MOUSE.COM instead. If you use MOUSE.COM,
invoke it in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file after the SET MOUSE= environment
variable. If you want to use MOUSE.SYS in conjunction with MOUSE.INI,
you must obtain Microsoft Mouse driver 8.2 or later and follow the
above instructions.
<P>
To obtain the current Microsoft Mouse driver, contact Microsoft End
User Sales at (800) 426-9400.
