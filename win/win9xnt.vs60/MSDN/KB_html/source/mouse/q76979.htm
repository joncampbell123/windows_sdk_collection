<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When using the Microsoft Mouse driver version 7.0 and Microsoft
Windows version 3.0, some MS-DOS applications may generate an error
message indicating that they cannot be run in a window, even though it
is possible to do so.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following message may appear when an MS-DOS application is run
from Microsoft Windows 3.0 in windowed mode and the Microsoft Mouse
driver version 7.0 has been loaded:
<P>
<PRE>   You cannot run this application in a window or in
   the background. You can display it in a window,
   but it will be suspended until you run it full
   screen. Check the PIF setting to ensure they are correct.

</PRE>The above message may appear when you try to run a program that uses
graphics modes or the mouse in a window.
<P>
However, if the application does not use graphics modes or a mouse,
the application may be switched into full screen mode by pressing
ALT+ENTER, then switched back into window mode by pressing ALT+ENTER
again. The application can then be run normally in a window.
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem with Microsoft Mouse
driver version 7.0. This problem does not occur in later versions of
the Microsoft Mouse driver.
<P>
The Microsoft Mouse driver version 7.04 is included in compressed form
on the distribution disks for Microsoft Windows 3.0. For information
on expanding the compressed mouse driver files, query on the following
words:
