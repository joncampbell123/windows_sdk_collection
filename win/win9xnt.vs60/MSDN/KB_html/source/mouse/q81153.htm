The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mouse Driver for MS-DOS, versions 7.x, 8.x, and 9.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If your Microsoft Mouse is on the PS/2 port of your machine and it
functions erratically, it may be out of sync with the CPU. This
information applies to PS/2-style versions of the Microsoft Mouse for
MS-DOS systems.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If your Microsoft Mouse is plugged into the PS/2 port of your machine
and it behaves erractically, for example, it opens boxes in Windows by
itself, moves around the screen when you aren't touching it, is
uncontrollable when you move it, and so on, the mouse may be out of
sync with the CPU. To see if this is the problem, plug the Microsoft
Mouse into the serial port of the machine or plug it into another
machine. If it behaves correctly on the serial port, then there is
either some conflict with the PS/2 port or the mouse is out of sync
with the CPU.
<P>
The PS/2 port runs off the machine's BIOS. As a result, the system
clock does not keep this port in sync with the CPU as it does the
serial ports. Because of this, the information that the Microsoft
Mouse sends through the PS/2 port may get disrupted, or out of sync.
Since there is no clock interrupt to get the Microsoft Mouse back into
sync, you must close the application and reinitialize the mouse.
<P>
If the above symptoms apply and the mouse works correctly through the
serial port, then the PS/2 port may be out of sync. Microsoft Mouse
version 8.1 or later is recommended for trying to correct this
problem.
<P>
If there is another PS/2 machine available and it has a working
Microsoft PS/2 style mouse on it, test the suspect Microsoft Mouse on
this machine by turning off the machine, plugging in the suspect mouse
and restarting the machine. If the Microsoft Mouse now behaves
correctly, Microsoft Mouse driver version 8.1 or later may solve the
problem. If it does not, then there may be a software conflict or a PS/2
port problem. If the Microsoft Mouse is still uncontrollable on this
second machine but it works fine on the serial port, there may be a
problem with the PS/2 adapter cable.
