<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article explains how to install a Microsoft Mouse in OS/2 1.3 AFTER
OS/2 is already fully installed on the machine. If OS/2 1.3 is not yet
on the machine, then query on the following words:
<P>
<PRE>   mouse and OS/2 and 1.3 and choices and install

</PRE>This information applies to all versions of the Microsoft Mouse and
Microsoft BallPoint Mouse.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Note: If MS Paintbrush version 4.0 will be run in the DOS
compatibility box of OS/2, then proceed to the section "Installing the
Microsoft OS/2 Mouse Driver." In all other cases, proceed with the
next section, "Installing the OS/2 supplied Mouse Drivers."
<P>
<P><h3>Installing the OS/2-Supplied Mouse Drivers</h3>
 
<P>
The mouse device drivers that accompany OS/2 version 1.3 are divided
into two categories: device dependent and device independent. To
install a Microsoft Mouse using the OS/2-supplied drivers, you must
determine what the appropriate device-dependent driver is for this
configuration. To do this, you must determine the exact type of
machine, the exact type of Microsoft Mouse, and how the mouse will be
attached. For more information on determining the exact type of
Microsoft Mouse, query on the following words:
<P>
<PRE>   mouse FCC ID

</PRE>Choose the appropriate device-dependent mouse driver from the
following table according to the type of machine being used and type
of Mouse.
<P>
<PRE>   IBM PS/2 Machines           AT-Style Machines
   -----------------           -----------------

   IBM PS/2 Model 30/286

   On PS/2 port   = MSPS201    On PS/2 port   = MSPS201
   On Serial port = MSSER01    On serial port = MSSER01
   Bus card       = MSBUS01    Bus card       = MSBUS01
   InPort card    = MSINP01    InPort card    = MSINP01

   IBM PS/2 Model 50 or above

   On PS/2 port   = MSPS202
   On serial port = MSSER02
   Bus/InPort cards are not
   compatible with these
   machines.

</PRE><h3>Setting Up the CONFIG.SYS File</h3>
 
<P>
Loading a Microsoft Mouse in OS/2 1.3 requires three lines in the
CONFIG.SYS File. The first line is the same for all Microsoft mice and
all types of machines, and should resemble the following:
<P>
<PRE>   device=c:\os2\pointdd.sys

</PRE>The second line loads the device-dependent mouse driver determined
from the table above. Note: The specific serial port (COM1 or COM2),
and the specific points-per-inch (ppi) of the Microsoft Mouse are
parameters for this line and must be known. The second line should
resemble the following:
<P>
<PRE>   device=c:\os2\msxxxxx.sys model=yyy serial=com2

</PRE>Note: SERIAL= Must be specified only for COM2, default is to COM1.
<PRE>      MODEL = Must be specified only for the BUS and SER versions.

      xxxxx = The device-dependent mouse driver from table above.
      yyy   = 099 for a 100 ppi, 199 for a 200 ppi; for a 400 ppi,
              first try 199, if that doesn't work, try 099.

</PRE>The third line is also based on the device-dependent mouse driver
determined in the table above, and should resemble the following:
<P>
<PRE>   device=c:\os2\mouse.sys type=msxxx$

</PRE>Note: xxx  = The middle letters in the device-dependent mouse
<PRE>             driver (BUS, SER, INP, or PS2).

</PRE>If a choice of any Microsoft Mouse was made during the installation of
OS/2 1.3, then ONLY the OS/2-supplied mouse drivers for that specific
choice were unpacked into the directory, C:\OS2, and three lines were
added to the CONFIG.SYS file. If during OS/2 1.2x installation, "None
of the above" was chosen for the type of Mouse, then NO mouse device
drivers were unpacked, and no lines were added to the CONFIG.SYS file
for the mouse.
<P>
Verify that these drivers are all in the C:\OS2 directory. If they are
not, they must be unpacked into this directory from disk 2 of the OS/2
disk set. For more information on unpacking files, query on these
words:
<P>
<PRE>   mouse and OS/2 and unpack

</PRE>Note: The MOUSE.SYS driver here is a mouse device-independent driver
from the OS/2 disks, not the MOUSE.SYS file supplied with the
Microsoft Mouse; that is a DOS Mouse device driver.
<P>
Shutdown OS/2, and reboot the machine.
<P>
<P><h3>Installing the Microsoft OS/2 Mouse Driver</h3>
 
<P>
Unlike the OS/2-supplied mouse drivers, the Microsoft OS/2 Mouse
driver is device independent. As long as you have a Microsoft Mouse
attached to either a Microsoft bus card, InPort card, or a Microsoft
serial Mouse attached to either COM1, COM2, or a PS/2 port, you will
load the same mouse driver in the same way.
<P>
<P><h3>Setting Up the CONFIG.SYS File</h3>
 
<P>
There should be only two lines in the CONFIG.SYS file referencing the
mouse when using the Microsoft-supplied mouse driver:
<P>
<PRE>   device=c:\os2\pointdd.sys
   device=c:\os2\os2mouse.v13

</PRE>Verify that both these files are in the C:\OS2 directory. If the
POINTDD.SYS driver is not, it must be unpacked from disk 2 of the OS/2
disk set. For more information on unpacking drivers, query on the
following words:
<P>
<PRE>   Mouse and OS/2 and unpack

</PRE>If the OS2MOUSE.V13 driver is not in the C:OS2 directory, it must be
copied from the Microsoft Mouse disk. To obtain the Microsoft OS/2
Mouse driver, OS2MOUSE.V13, call Microsoft Product Support at (425)
637-7096.
<P>
Shutdown OS/2 and reboot the machine.
