<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If you have problems using the Microsoft Mouse with Chronologic's Instant
Recall version 1.1, try loading the Mouse driver with the /Y switch.
<P>
This information applies to Microsoft Mouse driver versions 7.04 and later.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Instant Recall is a memory-resident information manager that comes with
mouse support. The mouse cursor appears as a dot in Instant Recall, even
though the program is a text-based application. The Microsoft Mouse driver
command line switch /Y disables hardware cursor support provided by some
video graphics adapter cards, which may cause conflicts. Using the /Y mouse
driver command line switch does not change the shape of the mouse cursor in
Instant Recall, but does eliminate a conflict if there is one occurring.
<P>
NOTE: The Microsoft Mouse driver command line switch /Y was introduced with
Mouse driver version 7.04. If you have an earlier version of the Microsoft
Mouse driver, contact Microsoft End User Sales at (800) 426-9400 to obtain
an update.
<P>
The Instant Recall product included here is manufactured by a vendor
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise,
regarding this product's performance or reliability.
