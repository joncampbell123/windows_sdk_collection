The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mouse Driver for MS-DOS, versions 7.x and 8.x
<LI>Microsoft Serial-PS/2 Mouse, version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When the 400 PPI PS/2 serial mouse is installed on the 9-pin serial
port of the Hyundai 386 SX, the mouse may not install.
<P>
This information applies to the Microsoft Serial-PS/2 Mouse for MS-DOS
systems.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When the 400 PPI PS/2 serial mouse is installed on the 9-pin serial
port as a serial mouse, it uses pins 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7 to communicate
with the serial port.
<P>
The other pins in the 9-pin connector are used when the PS/2 adapter
is connected to the mouse. Pin 8 of the built-in serial port, when set
to a logic zero, is 1 to 2 volts higher than the voltage that would be
present on an IBM-compatible serial port. When a logic 1 is present on
pin 8 and the mouse is connected to a 9-pin serial port, the mouse
cannot reset. This prevents the mouse from installing.
<P>
<P><h3>Workaround</h3>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, do the following:
<P>
<PRE>   Use a 9- to 25-pin serial adapter to eliminate the signal
   from pin 8. To do this, you need to purchase the adapter
   from a local electronics store. This adapter has a 9-pin
   female connector on one end and a 25-pin male connector
   on the other end.

</PRE>Once you have the adapter, perform the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Attach the adapter you purchased to the built-in serial port of
   your computer.

<P><LI>Attach the mouse to the 25- to 9-pin serial adapter that was
   supplied with your mouse.

<P><LI>Attach this adapter to the 9- to 25-pin adapter that you have
   already attached to your computer.
<P></OL>
