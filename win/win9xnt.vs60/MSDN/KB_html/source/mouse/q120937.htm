</PRE>_________________________________________________________________
<P>
<PRE>  I. THE MICROSOFT INTELLIPOINT SETUP PROGRAM

  1. Modifications to Your System

  The following changes are made to your system if you set up the
  software using all the default conditions during the IntelliPoint
  Setup program (default directory is c:\msinput). Future installations
  of Microsoft input devices will be installed to the msinput directory.

  a. For the mouse driver in MS-DOS, Setup makes the following changes:

     1. Installs or modifies lines similar to the following in
        AUTOEXEC.BAT:

        SET MSINPUT=C:\MSINPUT
        C:\MSINPUT\MOUSE\MOUSE.EXE /Q

     2. Removes the following line (if it exists) from CONFIG.SYS:

        device=c:\mouse.sys

  b. For the mouse driver in Windows, Setup makes the following changes:

     1. Adds the following line to the load line in WIN.INI:

        [windows] section             load=c:\msinput\pointer.exe

     2. Modifies the following lines in SYSTEM.INI:

        [boot] section               mouse.drv=c:\msinput\msinput.drv
        [boot.description] section   mouse.drv=Microsoft IntelliPoint
                                     version 1.0
        [386enh] section             keyboard=c:\msinput\msinput.386

     3. Adds a group to PROGMAN.INI:

        groupN=c:\windows\MicrosoX.grp
        (where N = next available group number, and where X = next
        available letter or number)

     4. Setup updates to the latest CTL3DV2.DLL file to the Windows
        System directory (if it's not already there).


  2. Returning Your System to Pre-Setup Condition

  To return your system to its previous condition before you
  ran the mouse Setup program, make the following modifications:

  a. If there are no other Microsoft input devices installed,
     then remove the following information from the load= line in
     the WIN.INI:

     c:\msinput\pointer.exe

     Do not remove this value or any other values for this setting if
     there are other Microsoft input devices installed (such as the
     Microsoft Natural Keyboard).

  b. Change the following lines in SYSTEM.INI to read:

     [boot] section               mouse.drv=mouse.drv
     [boot.description] section   mouse.drv=Microsoft, or IBM PS/2

  c. If there are no other Microsoft input devices installed, edit
     the following value in the SYSTEM.INI file so it reads:

     [386enh] section   keyboard=*vkd


  3. Setting up with a Floppy Disk System

  IntelliPoint windows Setup supports only hard disk systems. MS-DOS
  setup supports both hard disk systems and floppy disk systems with
  two drives. If you are installing files onto a floppy disk system that
  has only one drive, you must decompress and copy the files manually.
  EXPAND.EXE, a file-decompression program, is provided on the Setup disk
  for this purpose.

  To install using a single-drive floppy disk system:

  a. Insert the Setup disk into drive A: and type:

     expand mouse.ex_ b:mouse.exe

  b. When prompted by MS-DOS, remove the Setup disk and insert
     your destination disk.

  c. Reinsert the Setup disk in the drive and type:

     expand mousecpl.ex_ b:mousecpl.exe

  d. When prompted by MS-DOS, remove the Setup disk and
     insert your destination disk.

  To load your mouse driver, type:

     mouse

  Run IntelliPoint Tools &amp; Controls to set pointer options, if desired.
  To run IntelliPoint Tools &amp; Controls, type:

     mousecpl

  If you install the MS-DOS software using a dual floppy disk system,
  set up from drive B: to drive A:.


  4. If you boot from a Floppy Disk

  When you install IntelliPoint software, Setup modifies the AUTOEXEC.BAT
  file located on your default hard drive (normally C:). If you boot
  Microsoft Windows from a floppy disk, you will have to copy the two
  lines of information that were added to the AUTOEXEC.BAT file located
  on your boot disk manually. The two lines are:

     SET MSINPUT=C:\MSINPUT
     C:\MSINPUT\MOUSE\MOUSE.EXE /Q

  (The target directory will be different if you installed IntelliPoint
  software in a different directory.)


  5. Loading MOUSE.EXE into Upper Memory

  The MS-DOS mouse driver automatically loads itself into
  upper memory, if available. Using the MS-DOS loadhigh command
  may cause your mouse software to load into low memory.


</PRE>_________________________________________________________________
<P>
<PRE>  II. THE MOUSEPWR FEATURE

  Some laptop computers have the capability to go into a sleep mode
  to conserve power when not being used.  Choose the MOUSEPWR feature in
  Custom Setup if your mouse becomes erratic after you resume from sleep
  mode. MOUSEPWR restores pre-sleep mode settings of the mouse when you
  resume work on the laptop.

  It's not necessary to use MOUSEPWR if your system has Advanced
  Power Management (APM). However, this feature requires very
  little memory (928 bytes) and won't conflict with APM if both
  are loaded on your system.



</PRE>____________________________________________________________________
<P>
<PRE>  III. USING COMMAND-LINE SWITCHES IN MS-DOS

  If you are using the MS-DOS version of the software, you can type

     mouse.exe /?

  at the prompt to see a list of available switches.

</PRE>____________________________________________________________________
<P>
<P>
<PRE>  IV. NOTES ON INTELLIPOINT TOOLS &amp; CONTROLS FEATURES

  1. MS-DOS and Windows Features

  When you choose Set Buttons, Pointer Speed, Acceleration,
  and Orientation from IntelliPoint Tools &amp; Controls in Windows, the
  changes do not affect the MS-DOS driver until you reboot your computer.
  However, if you set these features from the IntelliPoint Tools &amp;
  Controls in MS-DOS, the changes affect both MS-DOS and Windows.


  2. Trails

  You can not adjust the length of Pointer Trails for Paletized
  video drivers through IntelliPoint Tools &amp; Controls.


</PRE>_____________________________________________________________________
<P>
<PRE>  V. OTHER ISSUES

  1. Hot Keys on LCD Screens

  On some LCD screens, some of the hot keys may not appear or are
  not highlighted.


  2. Large and Medium Pointers

  When using a large or medium sized pointer, some MS-DOS
  applications may not redraw the pointer correctly, resulting
  in "mouse droppings."

  When using a large or medium sized pointer, pointers in some
  applications may be distorted.  This is due to the method
  used to enlarge the pointer.

  3. Using the Sound feature in Special Effects

  If an IntelliPoint sound continues after you've finished your task
  you may be experiencing an interrupt conflict. You can disable
  IntelliPoint sound or change your sound card interrupt setting to
  resolve this problem.

  4. Using MS-DOS Disk Caching software during Setup

  If you use an MS-DOS disk cache software other than Microsoft
  SMARTDrive, don't choose Reboot after completing Setup. Choose Exit,
  then exit Windows and reboot your machine manually.

  Some DOS disk caching programs use a write behind caching technique.
  If the cache isn't flushed before rebooting, disk errors could occur.
