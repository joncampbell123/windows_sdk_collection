<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article discusses changes between the setup programs for the
Microsoft Mouse driver versions 8.2 and 9.0.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>New Functionality Provided with Version 8.2 Setup</h3>
 
<P>
The setup program included with version 8.2 of the Microsoft Mouse
Driver provides the following new functions:
<P>
<PRE>Windows Setup   Setup allows you to set up the mouse from either
                MS-DOS or Windows. (Previous versions of Setup did not
                provide the Windows option.) The Windows Setup option
                requires an additional device load library (DLL) file,
                WCOMMON.DLL, which provides file copy, import help file,
                and other drawing functions.

Copyright/      Version 8.2 includes a function that displays
Registration    copyright warning messages and allows you to register
                as the owner of the software.

BallPoint       Version 8.2 provides the Orientation program, which
Orientation     allows you to set the direction for the pointer to
                travel on the screen when you move the mouse.

</PRE><h3>New Functionality Provided with Version 9.0 Setup</h3>
 
<P>
The setup program included with version 9.0 includes the functionality
of 8.2 and the following additions:
<P>
<PRE>Mouse           The BallPoint Orientation program included in version
Orientation     8.2 is replaced by functions in Mouse Manager. In
                version 9.0, you orient your Mouse or BallPoint Mouse
                from the Mouse Manager dialog box in Control Panel. You
                can start this program from the MS-DOS version of the
                Setup program or from the RUN= line in Windows that Setup
                modifies.

Tutorial        Version 9.0 includes a tutorial utility called
                ERGODEMO.DLL, which you can run from the Windows
                version of Setup or from Mouse Manager.

Mouse Manager   The Mouse Control Panel for Windows (POINT.EXE) and for
                MS-DOS (CPANEL) are combined and renamed MOUSEMGR.EXE.
