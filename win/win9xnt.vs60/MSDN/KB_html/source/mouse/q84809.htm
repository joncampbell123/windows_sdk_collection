The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mouse Driver for MS-DOS, versions 6.x, 7.x, 8.x, 9.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.00a, 3.1, 3.11
</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Plus Hard Card conflicts with a Microsoft Mouse connected to a PS/2
style port if the card is set to IRQ 12. The cards do not come set to
IRQ 12 from the factory, but some of the Hard Cards are user-
configurable. If this is the case, the Hard Card should be changed to
another IRQ setting.
<P>
If the Hard Card is set to IRQ 12 and the Microsoft Mouse is connected
to the PS/2 port, IRQ conflicts occur in Windows 3.0 and 3.1, as well as
MS-DOS based applications that support the Microsoft Mouse. This is not
a problem with the Microsoft Mouse, but rather a hardware configuration
issue
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
PS/2 mouse ports use IRQ 12 to communicate with the central processor
unit (CPU). The following Plus Hard Cards have the capability of using
IRQ 12, which conflicts with a Microsoft Mouse using the PS/2 port.
<P>
<PRE>   Hard Card II    (40 MB, 80 MB)
   Hard Card IIxl  (50 MB, 105 MB)

</PRE>These drives are not set to IRQ 12 by default. If you set it to IRQ
12, and you subsequently purchase a Microsoft PS/2 style mouse, the
Microsoft Mouse cannot work. The only workaround is to use the mouse
on a serial port, or to change the IRQ settings on the card.
<P>
The product included here, Plus Hard Card, is manufactured by a vendor
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise,
regarding this product's performance or reliability.
