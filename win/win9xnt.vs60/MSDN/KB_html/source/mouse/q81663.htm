<P>
I. NOTES ON SETUP FOR DOS AND WINDOWS
<P>
<P><h3>The APPEND Command</h3>
 
<P>
SETUP may not work properly if you have used the MS-DOS APPEND
command.If APPEND is in effect, then remove it before running Setup by
typing
<P>
<PRE>     APPEND;

</PRE>at the DOS command line (include the semicolon).
<P>
<P><h3>PATH Modifications</h3>
 
<P>
If you have a long PATH statement in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file, you may
want to tell Setup not to add the Mouse files to your PATH. If you
exceed the DOS limit of 127 characters, you will have to switch to (or
specify) the directory containing the mouse file you want to load or
run.
<P>
Note that some systems may not start properly if the AUTOEXEC.BAT file
being used contains a PATH statement that is too long. If this occurs
with your system, restart the computer using a floppy system disk (DOS
boot disk) and edit the PATH statement so that it contains fewer than
127 characters.
<P>
If you have an older version of the mouse software on your system and
the directory that includes the older version is included in your
PATH, you should delete this directory from the PATH statement.
Leaving the directory in the PATH may cause the older files to be
found when you enter mouse commands at the DOS command line.
<P>
Older versions of the mouse software do not include all the features
of version 8.0+, including BallPoint Mouse support. Delete older
versions of the mouse software from your system and use a text editor
to remove the older directory from the PATH statement in your
AUTOEXEC.BAT file.
<P>
<P><h3>Single-drive PCs</h3>
 
<P>
If you have a single-drive PC without a hard disk, you will not be
able to use the Setup program to install the MS mouse software.  For
more information, see "Installing the Mouse for Additional
Configurations" in the Mouse User's Guide.
<P>
<P><h3>Network Installations</h3>
 
<P>
If you have a network, the Setup program should install the mouse
software correctly. If you experience problems getting the mouse to
work with network software on your computer, you may need to make sure
that the network software loads before the mouse software. After
running the Mouse Setup program, check the order in which the files
load in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file and change it if necessary.
<P>
<P><h3>Loading the DOS Mouse Driver under Windows</h3>
 
<P>
You cannot load the DOS mouse driver from the DOS Prompt in Windows.
To load the DOS mouse driver so that it is available when you go to
the DOS Prompt from Windows:
<P>
<PRE>     1. Exit Windows
     2. Type MOUSE at the command line
     3. Restart Windows
</PRE>_________________________________________________________
<P>
II. NEW LCD SCREEN POINTER OPTIONS
<P>
To improve mouse pointer visibility on computers with liquid-crystal
(LCD) displays, version 8.10 of the mouse software introduces several
features.  Pointer visibility can be improved by altering the size and
color of the pointer. The pointer can also be made to grow in size
when the mouse is moved, returning to its normal size when mouse
movement slows. This "growth" capability helps you keep track of the
pointer when it is in motion, yet still do detail work with the
pointer at its normal size--without obstructing vision of an object or
control on the screen. Pointer settings are kept in the MOUSE.INI
file.
<P>
<P><h3>Improving pointer visibility in DOS</h3>
 
<P>
For non-Windows applications, pointer visibility options must be set
from the DOS command line. The new POINTER command is provided for
this purpose and uses the following format:
<P>
<PRE>     POINTER [size,color,growth,threshold,delay]

where     size = 1, 1.5, or 2  (normal/small, medium, large)
          color = normal, reverse, or transparent
          growth = 1 or 0  (on or off)
          threshold = 1-100
          delay = 1-100

</PRE>In DOS text mode, the normal pointer, often referred to as a cursor,
has the shape of a square box. To improve visibility on LCD screens in
text mode, the medium pointer takes the shape of a cross, while the
large pointer is shaped like a large box with a hole in the middle.
<P>
Text mode pointer shapes:
<P>
<PRE>                              X                XXX
       Normal  X     Medium  XXX        Large  X X
                              X                XXX

</PRE>Note that in DOS graphics mode, specifying medium or large does not
change the arrow pointer size. Instead, the pointer is surrounded by a
rounded box to improve visibility.
<P>
The normal (white) pointer can be made reverse (black) in color. The
actual colors may differ depending on the type of screen you are
using.  A third color choice is transparent," which makes the pointer
opposite in color to whatever is beneath it at any given time. This
gives it a transparent effect as it is moved over text and objects on
the screen.
<P>
The growth option is specified as either 1 or 0 (on or off). When
growth is on, the setting for threshold is used to determine the speed
at which the mouse must be moving before the pointer will be "grown"
to either medium or large (depending on which was specified with the
size parameter). Both threshold speed and delay are relative numbers
in the range 1 to 100, representing minimum to maximum settings. A
maximum delay of 100 corresponds to a delay of approximately ten
seconds before the pointer returns to small size on the screen. Note
that threshold and delay settings have no visible effect when the
growth parameter is off.
<P>
Pointer parameters must be entered in the order shown above, separated
by commas. However, parameters may be skipped by leaving out their
numeric values.Spaces are ignored. Values that are not being changed,
but follow those you are changing, may be omitted. Parameters that are
skipped or omitted result in no change to those settings in mouse-
driver memory.
<P>
Example DOS pointer commands:
<P>
<PRE>     POINTER 2
     POINTER 2,reverse
     POINTER 2,reverse,1,30,10
     POINTER 1.5,,0
     POINTER,transparent,1
     POINTER,,,30,10

     POINTER         (displays brief command-line help)


</PRE><h3>Improving pointer visibility in Windows</h3>
 
<P>
Pointer settings are now available using the Pointer option button in
the Windows Mouse Control Panel version 8.10. You can customize your
Windows pointer by selecting the Size and Color icons that make it
easiest to view on your LCD screen. Note that your choices take effect
immediately, so that you can quickly determine which combination of
settings is best for you.
<P>
The pointer growth feature is available when you choose either a
Medium or Large pointer size. To turn on growth, click the On button.
When you move the mouse quickly, and with growth on, the pointer will
"grow" to the pointer size you have selected. Once mouse movement
slows, the pointer will return to its Normal (or smallest) size again.
You can set the mouse speed required to cause the pointer to grow by
moving the Threshold slider bar. The amount of time that the pointer
remains larger, before it returns to Normal size, is set using the
Delay control.
<P>
Note that the growth feature works only with the normal system
pointers used in Windows. Many Windows applications include additional
pointers for specific tasks. These additional, or
application-specific, pointers are not affected by the growth option.
The size and color options do, however, take effect with
application-specific pointers.
<P>
The Restore button at the bottom of the Pointer Options dialog box
allows you to return all pointer settings to their default values for
Windows.  When you choose Restore, the Size and Color options will
indicate that nothing is currently selected, and the Growth feature is
turned off. You may notice that the shapes of some of the Small
pointers differ slightly from the default (restored) Windows shapes.
The Small pointer shapes have been adjusted to improve visibility on
LCD screens.
<P>
You keep pointer settings in effect in Windows and in your Windows
applications, by choosing the OK button. To discard the changes you
have made, choose Cancel. When you choose OK, the Pointer Options
dialog closes and you are returned to the Mouse Control Panel where
you can choose other mouse settings. Note that settings changes are
recorded permanently from the Control Panel only when you choose OK.
In order to keep the growth feature running when you choose OK, the
following filename is added to your WIN.INI file:
<P>
<PRE>     load=c:\mouse\pointer.exe

</PRE>Please note that help is available from the Pointer Options dialog box
by choosing the Help button or simply pressing F1.
<P>
<P><h3>Pointer settings in MOUSE.INI</h3>
 
<P>
Pointer settings are stored in two new sections in the MOUSE.INI file.
This file is located in the directory you specify when you run the
Setup program. Following are the settings in MOUSE.INI that are
installed when you tell Setup you want to improve pointer visibility
for your LCD screen. These are the default settings, which will change
when you use either the POINTER command from DOS or the Pointer
Options button in Windows.
<P>
<PRE>  [DOSPointer]              [WindowsPointer]
  PointerSize=Large         PointerSize=Large
  PointerColor=Normal       PointerColor=Normal
  Growth=OFF                Growth=OFF
  Threshold=20              Threshold=20
  Delay=3                   Delay=3

</PRE>Note: Pointer settings can be made different in DOS than in Windows.
This is so that you can optimize pointer visibility to account for the
different color schemes used in the two operating environments.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Using Pointer Options with Included Menu Software</h3>
 
<P>
Pointer visibility options are not compatible with the menu programs
that are included with the mouse software. Loading a DOS-application
mouse menu will disable any pointer options which may have been in
effect.  The mouse menu will load and function properly, however.
Similarly, if you have a mouse menu loaded and attempt to also load
pointer options (using POINTER.EXE from the command line), the menu
will cease to function, and the pointer options will take effect.
<P>

III. USING THE MS MOUSE WITH OS/2
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Installing an OS/2 Mouse Driver</h3>
 
<P>
This release includes two Microsoft OS/2 Mouse drivers:
<P>
<PRE>     OS2MOUSE.V11     for OS/2 version 1.1
     OS2MOUSE.V13     for OS/2 versions 1.2 and 1.3

</PRE>These drivers work with the following pointing devices:
<P>
<PRE>     MS Serial-PS/2 Mouse
     MS Bus(Inport) Mouse
     MS BallPoint Mouse

</PRE>You do not need a separate driver for each type of mouse. Installation
of the OS/2 mouse drivers must be done manually.
<P>
To install an OS/2 mouse driver:
<P>
<PRE>  (Assume your device drivers are in the directory C:\OS2.)

     1. Copy OS2MOUSE.V11 (or OS2MOUSE.V13) to C:\OS2.
     2. Edit your CONFIG.SYS file to remove the line that
        points to your current mouse driver. This line will
        vary according to the type of mouse installed.
        Example line to be removed:

        DEVICE=C:\OS2\IBMMOU1.SYS      (remove this line)

     3. If you are using OS/2 version 1.2, you must also
        remove the line that includes MOUSE.SYS. Example
        line to be removed:

        DEVICE=C:\OS2\MOUSE.SYS TYPE=MSSER$
                                    (remove this line)

     4. Insert one of the following lines in the CONFIG.SYS
        file:

        DEVICE=C:\OS2\OS2MOUSE.V11 (insert for OS/2 ver.1.1)
           or
        DEVICE=C:\OS2\OS2MOUSE.V13 (for OS/2 1.2 or 1.3)

     5. Save these changes and restart your computer.


</PRE>____________________________________________________________
V. MISCELLANEOUS ITEMS
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Loading MOUSE.INI settings</h3>
 
<P>
The settings in MOUSE.INI are read by both the DOS and Windows mouse
drivers only when they load. Similarly, the Windows Mouse Control
Panel reads the settings in MOUSE.INI only when it is started. The DOS
mouse utilities Compass and Control Panel get their initial settings
from those resident in mouse-driver memory.
<P>
Saving changes permanently from any of the mouse utilities updates
both the settings in driver memory and the settings in the MOUSE.INI
file.  However, if you edit the MOUSE.INI file manually, your new
settings will not be recognized by either mouse driver until it is
reloaded.
<P>
To make your edits to settings take effect in DOS:
<P>
<PRE>     1. Save the edited MOUSE.INI.
     2. Restart your computer.
        or,
        Remove the mouse driver from memory by typing MOUSE
             OFF;
        then reload the mouse driver by typing MOUSE.

</PRE>To make your edits to settings take effect in Windows:
<P>
<PRE>     1. Save the edited MOUSE.INI.
     2. Exit Windows.
     3. Restart Windows.

</PRE>For more information on editing the settings in MOUSE.INI,
see Appendix A in the Microsoft Mouse User's Guide.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Using High or Expanded Memory with DOS 5.0</h3>
 
<P>
You may use the loadhigh or devicehigh commands in DOS 5.0 to load the
mouse driver into high or expanded memory. To load the mouse driver
into one of these memory areas, use the /U or /E mouse command-line
switches provided. For more information on mouse driver memory
management, see Appendix A in the Mouse User's Guide.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Using the MS Mouse with Desqview</h3>
 
<P>
When run as a TSR, or pop-up program, the DOS mouse control panel
CPANEL.COM is not fully compatible with DesqView. The non-TSR mode of
CPANEL works correctly under DesqView. To use CPANEL with DesqView,
use the /t command-line option, select Directed Text Output, Don't
Virtualize, and Uses Serial Ports. In Advanced Setup (F1), select
Close on Exit.
