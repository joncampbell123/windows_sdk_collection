The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mouse, versions 1.0 and 2.0
<LI>Microsoft BallPoint Mouse, versions 1.0 and 2.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft currently manufactures two types of mice: the Microsoft Mouse and
the Microsoft BallPoint Mouse.
<P>
The Microsoft Mouse is a standard desktop pointing device. The Microsoft
BallPoint Mouse is designed to be attached to a notebook or laptop
computer, but it can also be attached to a standard desktop keyboard.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Mouse</h3>
 
<P>
The information below applies to both versions of the Microsoft Mouse.
<P>
The Microsoft Mouse is a two-button desktop pointing device. There are four
different types of the Microsoft Mouse. The type of mouse defines how it
can be connected to your computer and is clearly marked on the front of the
retail package.
<P>
The four different types of the Microsoft Mouse are as follows:

<UL><LI>Serial Mouse (marked "Serial Version" on front of package).
<P>
   This mouse works on a 9- or 25-pin serial port only and ships with a
   9-to-25 pin serial adapter.
<P>
   NOTE: A serial-to-mouse port adapter is not shipped with this package
   since this mouse does not work on a mouse port (PS/2 port).

<LI>Mouse Port Compatible Mouse (marked "Round Mouse Port PS/2
   Version" on front of package).
<P>
   This mouse works on a PS/2-style mouse port only. Connecting this mouse
   to a serial port with an adapter does not work.

<LI>Serial-Mouse Port Compatible Mouse (marked "Round Mouse Port PS/2 and
   Serial Version" on front of package).
<P>
   The circuitry of this mouse allows it to work on both serial and mouse
   ports (PS/2 ports).
<P>
   It ships with a serial-to-mouse port adapter as well as a 9-to-25 pin
   serial adapter. This mouse is often referred to as a "combination
   mouse."

<LI>Bus or Inport Mouse (marked "Bus Version" on front of package).
<P>
   The bus mouse ships with its own interface card, which plugs into any
   available expansion slot on an ISA or EISA machine. It is not compatible
   with MCA expansion slots. The bus mouse is "interrupt selectable" (you
   can choose from interrupts 2 through 5) and can save serial ports for
   other uses.
<P>
</UL>NOTES:
<P>
Adapting the bus mouse to work on a serial or mouse port is not supported.
<P>
You should decide which mouse to use based on the available resources of
your computer system (for example, available expansion slots, serial ports,
or a mouse port).
<P>
<P><h3>BallPoint Mouse</h3>
 
<P>
The Microsoft BallPoint Mouse is a pointing device designed to be attached
to a notebook or laptop computer. It can also be attached to a standard
desktop keyboard. The BallPoint Mouse is available in versions 1.0 and 2.0,
but unlike the desktop Microsoft Mouse, there are substantial differences
in type depending on the version.

<UL><LI>Version 1.0
<P>
   This mouse is sold in two types; mouse port only and serial-mouse port
   compatible. Compatibility, limitations, and provided adapters are the
   same as the desktop varieties noted above.

<LI>Version 2.0
<P>
   The version 2.0 BallPoint is sold in a mouse port version only. It
   cannot be adapted to work on any other port.
