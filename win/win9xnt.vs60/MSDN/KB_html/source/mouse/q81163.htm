<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If you run the Microsoft Windows Setup program from MS-DOS and choose
the Other option when selecting the Windows mouse driver, the Microsoft
Mouse may behave strangely in non-Windows applications that are running
from Windows. To solve this problem, use the Microsoft, IBM PS/2 option
as the mouse driver for the Microsoft Mouse.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Windows Setup program allows you to use device drivers that are
provided by hardware manufacturers. To use these drivers, you select
the Other option, which requires a disk provided by the hardware
manufacturer. Setup then prompts you for the disk or directory where
the drivers are located. After finding the drivers in the specified
path, Setup offers you a choice of the drivers that are available.
When you choose an option, Setup makes the necessary changes to the
SYSTEM.INI file.
<P>
If you follow the above procedure when installing a Microsoft Mouse,
unpredictable results can occur. If, for example, you choose Other for
the mouse and specify a directory where a MOUSE.DRV file is located,
Setup presents the name of the driver for you to select. The name will
be something like "Microsoft Mouse" or "Microsoft Mouse version 8.0."
Selecting one of these options seems logical, but doing so can cause
problems.
<P>
Some of the symptoms of this problem include Windows returning to the
MS-DOS prompt after displaying the Windows logo, erratic or sluggish
mouse movement in non-Windows applications that are run from Windows,
or system hangs when returning to Windows from a non-Windows
application that uses the mouse.
<P>
To eliminate this problem, choose a driver that Setup lists rather
than the Other option. When using a Microsoft Mouse, you should choose
the Microsoft, IBM PS/2 option.
