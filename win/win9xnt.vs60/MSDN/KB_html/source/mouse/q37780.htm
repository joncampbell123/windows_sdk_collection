<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Serial Mouse may not work properly with the IBM Token
Ring network adapter because the adapter may take control of both COM1
and COM2. For example, one customer tried the serial mouse on the
mouse port of a PS/2 model 55x that was configured as a workstation in
an IBM Token Ring, but the mouse failed to work properly.
<P>
Customers should contact IBM as to whether or not the COM ports can be
made available.
<P>
One possible workaround is to use a bus mouse instead of a serial
mouse.
<P>
Note that for a serial mouse, you must keep the interrupt level used
by the COM port as 4 or 3, or else the mouse won't work.
<P>
The product included here is manufactured by a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this
product's performance or reliability.
