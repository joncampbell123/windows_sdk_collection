The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mouse Driver for MS-DOS, versions 7.x, 8.x, and 9.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If you receive the message "Drive not installed; Microsoft Mouse not
found" each time you start your computer, and your Microsoft Mouse
does not work in any MS-DOS application, this indicates that when the
Microsoft Mouse Driver searched your computer system for a Microsoft
Mouse, it could not detect a Microsoft Mouse.
<P>
This problem could be caused by incorrect serial port configuration,
interrupt conflicts or a defective mouse.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following is a brief description of the configurations the
Microsoft Mouse Driver requires to install. This information applies
to all versions of the Microsoft Mouse for MS-DOS systems.
<P>
The industry standards for the configuration of serial ports are as
follows:
<P>
<PRE>   Port    Address    Interrupt
   ----    -------    ---------

   COM1    03F8h      IRQ4
   COM2    02F8h      IRQ3
   COM3    03E8h      IRQ4
   COM4    02E8h      IRQ3

</PRE>Notice that COM1 and COM3 share an interrupt, as do COM2 and COM4.
Because of this, if there are two devices on COM ports that share an
interrupt, there will be a conflict between the two. A typical example
of this is having a modem on COM3 and trying to install a Microsoft
Mouse on COM1. To resolve such a situation, keep the modem on COM1,
IRQ4 and put the Microsoft Mouse on COM2, IRQ3, or vice versa.
<P>
The addresses of the COM ports are important to the Microsoft Mouse
driver. For more information about finding these addresses, query on
the following words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   mouse and com and port and address and debug

</PRE>To verify the interrupt used by each port, check the documentation
for the computer (if the port is on the motherboard), the I/O card
documentation (if the port is on a card), or run a diagnostic
program. Most I/O cards will have jumpers or switches that allow
you to change the configuration of the card. You will need to
contact your machine manufacturer or your vendor for further
information on how to change your port switch settings.
<P>
If your ports are configured correctly, take your Microsoft Mouse to
another machine that has a working Microsoft Mouse on it. Turn off the
machine, plug the first Microsoft Mouse in, turn the machine on, and see if
the suspect Microsoft Mouse works. If it does, then there may be something
wrong with the port on your machine. If it does not work, then there is
probably something wrong with your Microsoft Mouse. If this is the case,
you should call Microsoft Sales Information Center (MSIC) at (800) 426-9400
for information about how to get your Microsoft Mouse repaired.
<P>
NOTE: COM3 and COM4 are not supported by the Microsoft Mouse.
