The following information applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft BallPoint Mouse version 2.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft BallPoint Mouse version 2.0 includes a size 1 keyboard
clip. This clip is too small to fit many desktop and some laptop
keyboards. Three other keyboard clip sizes are available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft BallPoint Mouse version 2.0 hardware includes the
pointing device itself and a size 1 keyboard clip. The keyboard clip
is designed to attach to the side of a laptop or desktop keyboard by
using adjustable extensions; the BallPoint Mouse is then attached to
the keyboard clip. This design permits the clip to remain attached,
while allowing for easy removal of the BallPoint Mouse.
<P>
If the size 1 clip does not fit your keyboard, you can determine the
correct clip size by using the ruler in the upper-right corner on the
last page of the Microsoft BallPoint Mouse "User's Guide." (This page
is titled "Microsoft BallPoint Mouse Disk and Keyboard Clip Offer.")
Turn the page counterclockwise and measure the keyboard as indicated
by the photograph on the page. Place the arrow on the outer-edge of
the numeric keypad; the edge of the keyboard should fall within one of
three numbered areas: 2, 3, or 4. This number is the clip size that
fits your keyboard.
<P>
You can order the keyboard clip through the mail by completing the
order page in the manual (no photocopies or facsimiles will be
accepted) and enclosing the dated sales receipt for the BallPoint
Mouse, or by calling the Microsoft Sales Information Center (MSIC) at
(800) 426-9400.
