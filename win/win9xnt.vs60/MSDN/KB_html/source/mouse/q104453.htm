<UL><LI>Microsoft Mouse driver for Windows, version 9.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After you install the Microsoft Mouse driver version 9.0 to a network
installation of Windows, the following error occurs when you try to run the
Mouse Manager:
<P>
<PRE>   FILE ERROR: Cannot find CTL3D.DLL

   Application Execution Error: Cannot find file MOUSEMGR.EXE (or one
   of its components). Check to ensure the path and filename are correct
   and that all required libraries are available.

</PRE>Or, if you install the Microsoft Mouse driver version 9.0 to a network
shared installation of Windows, you receive the following error:
<P>
<PRE>   CANNOT COPY FILE CTL3D.DLL

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The file CTL3D.DLL is designed to install to the Windows SYSTEM
subdirectory. When the 9.0 Setup program does not find a SYSTEM
subdirectory under Windows, it does not install the file CTL3D.DLL, which
is required to run Mouse Manager.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Mouse driver
version 9.00. This problem was corrected in Microsoft Mouse driver version
9.01.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Copy CTL3D.DLL from the Mouse Setup disks to your Windows directory by
using the following syntax:
<P>
<PRE>   copy a:ctl3d.dll c:\&lt;your directory&gt;\ctl3d.dll

   -or-

   If you cannot complete the mouse setup, do the following:

   1. Create a SYSTEM subdirectory in your local Windows directory.

   2. After a successful installation, copy the CTL3D.DLL from the SYSTEM
      subdirectory to the local Windows directory.

   3. Delete the CTL3D.DLL file from the SYSTEM subdirectory and then
      remove the SYSTEM subdirectory.
