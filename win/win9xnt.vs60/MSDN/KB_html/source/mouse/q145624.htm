The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft IntelliPoint software versions 1.0, 1.0a, 1.1
<LI>Microsoft IntelliType software versions 1.0, 1.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.1, 3.11
<LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you search for a file using File Manager in Windows or Windows for
Workgroups version 3.1 or 3.11, the mouse pointer may disappear. When you
move the mouse after the search is completed, the mouse pointer may not
reappear.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem can occur when the following conditions are met:

<UL><LI>The IntelliPoint or IntelliType Vanish feature is enabled.

<LI>The mouse pointer is located in the Search For or Start From box
   when you start the search.

<LI>You press ENTER to start the search instead of clicking OK.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To cause the mouse pointer to reappear, you must restart Windows. To
prevent the problem from occurring again, disable the Vanish feature, make
sure the mouse pointer is not located in the Search For or Start From box
when you start the search, or click OK instead of pressing ENTER to start
the search.
<P>
To disable the IntelliPoint Vanish feature, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>In Control Panel, double-click the Mouse icon.

<P><LI>Click the Visibility tab.

<P><LI>Click the "Make the pointer disappear when you begin typing" check box
   to clear it.

<P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
</OL>To disable the IntelliType Vanish feature, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>In Control Panel, double-click the Keyboard icon.

<P><LI>Click the Pointer Activity tab.

<P><LI>Click the "Make the pointer disappear when you begin typing" check box
   to clear it.

<P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Vanish feature causes the mouse pointer to disappear when you begin
typing in a Windows-based program. When you move the mouse after typing
text in a Windows-based program, the pointer reappears. This feature is
useful if you frequently move the mouse pointer out of the way before you
begin typing.
