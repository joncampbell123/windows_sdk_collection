The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FORTRAN Compiler for MS-DOS, version 5.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article shows by example how to use Windows API calls to switch
focus between windows.
<P>
There are 2 concerns with adding functionality to a QuickWin application
with the Windows API.

<UL><LI>A large portion of the functionality in a Windows-based application is
   provided outside the API (by message handling, and so forth). For this
   reason, much of this functionality can't be provided under QuickWin.
   To get a full GUI interface, you'll need to use Visual C++ or Visual
   Basic.

<LI>Many APIs will not behave as expected. In this example, GetFocus() works
   well at first, but if the user changes focus to a different window while
   the command setvideomode() is executing, the call to GetFocus() gets the
   handle of the wrong window. In a Windows-based application, the program
   would keep track of each window's handle as the window is created,
   rather than trying to determine the handle of a window by assuming that
   it currently has the focus.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following QuickWin program creates a text window and a graphics window,
sets focus to the text window, waits for the user response, and then
returns focus to the graphics window.
<P>
This example assumes that the QuickWin Graphics Library update has been
made.
<P>
To install the graphics update, follow the instructions in the README.TXT
file on the installation disk labelled "Microsoft FORTRAN, QuickWin
Graphics Library" (NOTE: The "QuickWin Graphics Library" is in fine print.)
<P>
<P><h3>Sample Code</h3>
 
<P>
C Compile options needed: /MW
C Link with modified library LLIBFEW.LIB
<P>
<PRE>      interface to integer*2 function getfocus
     +  [PASCAL,alias:'GetFocus']()
      end
      interface to integer*2 function setfocus
     +  [PASCAL,alias:'SetFocus'](i)
      integer*2 i
      end

      include'fgraph.fi'
      include'fgraph.fd'

      integer*2 i, texthandle, graphicshandle, getfocus, setfocus

</PRE>C     Get handle for the current window (assumed to be the text window)
<PRE>      texthandle = getfocus()
</PRE>C     Create graphics window and get it's handle
<PRE>      i=setvideomode($sres256color)
</PRE>C     This is NOT the same handle as returned from WGGETACTIVEQQ
<PRE>      graphicshandle=getfocus()

</PRE>C     Set focus to text window
<PRE>      i = setfocus(texthandle)
      write(*,*) "Hit &lt;Enter&gt; to continue"
      read(*,*)

</PRE>C     Set focus to graphics window
<PRE>      i=setfocus(graphicshandle)
      end
