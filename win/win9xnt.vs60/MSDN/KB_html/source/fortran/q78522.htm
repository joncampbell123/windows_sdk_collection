<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This application note corrects the unresolved externals that may occur
when linking a mixed-language Windows program using FORTRAN and C. If
the FORTRAN code uses the ALLOCATE statement, LINK may generate the
following errors:
<P>
<PRE>   LINK : error L2029:  Unresolved external: _hfree
   LINK : error L2029:  Unresolved external: _hmalloc

</PRE>To obtain the application note "PATCH: Allocate in Mixed-Language
Windows Programming," call Microsoft Product Support Services.
<P>
This application note is also available in the Microsoft Software Library.

</PRE>This application note corrects a problem that occurs when you link a
mixed-language Windows program using FORTRAN and C. If the FORTRAN
code uses the ALLOCATE statement, LINK generates two errors:
<P>
<PRE>   LINK : error L2029:  Unresolved external: _hfree
   LINK : error L2029:  Unresolved external: _hmalloc

</PRE>The errors are caused by the absence of several routines in the C-
compatible FORTRAN run-time library. To correct this problem, you must
add to the C-compatible FORTRAN run-time library the three object
modules that are included on the enclosed HF0484 disk.
<P>
<P><h3>Modifying the C-Compatible FORTRAN Run-Time Library</h3>
 
<P>
To make the correction to the C-compatible FORTRAN run-time library,
copy the following three object modules from the enclosed HF0484 disk
to the directory where your FORTRAN library is located:
<P>
<PRE>   WHALLOC.OBJ
   WHSEG.OBJ
   HMAP.OBJ

</PRE>Then, enter the following command
<P>
<PRE>   LIB &lt;LIBNAME.LIB&gt; + WHALLOC.OBJ + WHSEG.OBJ + HMAP.OBJ;

</PRE>where &lt;LIBNAME.LIB&gt; represents the name of the C-compatible FORTRAN
run-time library you want to modify. You can then delete the three
object modules from the library directory. The library manager will
make a backup file named &lt;LIBNAME.BAK&gt;. When the new library has been
tested successfully, you can also delete this backup file.
