The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FORTRAN PowerStation for MS-DOS, version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The following information is from parts 6 and 7 of the Microsoft
FORTRAN PowerStation README.TXT file located in the \F32\README
directory.
<P>
<PRE>   Part 6: Using the Debugger
   Part 7: Miscellaneous

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Part 6: Using the Debugger</h3>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Optimizing Debugging Speed</h3>
 
<P>
Because a program being debugged runs as a separate task under Windows,
the speed at which the debugger operates depends upon how many other
programs are being executed at the same time. If screen-swapping is
disabled, FORTRAN Visual Workbench must yield control back to Windows,
and any other program waiting for cycles is serviced along with the
program being debugged in the remote monitor window. To improve the
speed of the debugger, don't run other applications at the same time.
<P>
<P><h3>Watching Complex Variables in Commons</h3>
 
<P>
Debugging code that has complex variables in common blocks causes the
watch window to display them as characters. This affects common record
variables. They are shown in the locals window as a single space rather
than as a structure.
<P>
<P><h3>Using Mixed Source/Asm during Debugging</h3>
 
<P>
You can only view Mixed Source/Asm (selected from the View menu)
during a debugging session if you have not built the target with the
/Ox option (optimize for time). (The release version will disable
Mixed Source/Asm if the /Ox option is enabled in the Compiler Options
dialog box.) If you attempt to view Mixed Source/Asm for a target
built with the /Ox option, the debugger will not be able to show all
of the assembly instructions. Unexpected results may occur.
<P>
<P><h3>Viewing Strings and Arrays in the Locals Window</h3>
 
<P>
When you first step into a program or routine, you will not be able to
see the values or variable-length strings or allocatable arrays until
you step at least once inside the subprogram. This is because the
lengths are not computed until after the debugger has begun executing
subprogram code. Once you have stepped into the subprogram, you can
view the values of single dimensional allocatable arrays.
<P>
<P><h3>Debugging Very Large Programs</h3>
 
<P>
Although it is possible to debug a program that has an executable file
and symbol table that are close to (or larger than) the amount of
physical memory in your PC, the debugger will take longer to load the
symbols. This is because the Windows memory manager must swap portions
of memory during loading.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Part 7: Miscellaneous</h3>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Running Programs</h3>
 
<P>
FORTRAN programs can be executed from the FORTRAN Visual Workbench
either in a window or in full-screen mode. You select which to use in
the Execute/Debug Options dialog box. FORTRAN programs can be run from
an MS-DOS session within Windows either in a window or in full-screen
mode. You can switch between these modes from within the MS-DOS
session by pressing ALT+ENTER. You can also select the mode for a
minimized MS-DOS session from the Settings dialog box.
<P>
Programs that use graphics may not run properly within a window. In
most cases, Microsoft Windows will ask you to switch to full-screen mode
if the graphics mode is not supported by the graphics driver. Some
graphics modes are only partially supported in a window. In this case,
the results will depend upon which graphics routines are used by the
program.
<P>
For best results, we recommend that graphics programs are always
executed in full-screen mode.
<P>
<P><h3>Redistribution Rights</h3>
 
<P>
You have the right to distribute the MS-DOS extender files DOSXMSF.EXE
and DOSXNT.386 with programs that you create with FORTRAN
PowerStation. There is no royalty required.
<P>
The font files COURB.FON, HELVB.FON, and TMSRB.FON are owned by
BitStream, Inc. If you want to distribute these files with a program,
you will need get permission from BitStream.
<P>
If you have any questions about redistribution rights, please contact
Microsoft Product Support Services.
<P>
<P><h3>About Other Text Files</h3>
 
<P>
There are four other text files with information about Microsoft
FORTRAN PowerStation.
