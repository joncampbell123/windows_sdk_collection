<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The following are the sections titled "Installing QuickWin Graphics"
and "Supplemental Notes for the QuickWin Graphics User's Guide" from
the QuickWin Graphics 3.0 README.TXT file that ships with Microsoft
FORTRAN version 5.1.

<P>
Installation instructions for Microsoft QuickWin Ver. 3.0 (FORTRAN)
Copyright (C) Microsoft Corp. 1992. All rights reserved.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>INSTALLING QUICKWIN GRAPHICS</h3>
 
<P>
It is strongly recommended that you read this section fully before
running the QuickWin Graphics setup program.
<P>
You will need approximately 750K of free space on your hard disk drive
to successfully install QuickWin Graphics for Microsoft FORTRAN.
<P>
To set up QuickWin Graphics, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Insert the Program Disk into your floppy disk drive.

<P><LI>Run the SETUP program.
<P>
   NOTE: If you chose to install Microsoft FORTRAN with directory
   names other than the default names, you should substitute the
   directories which you specified when installing Microsoft FORTRAN
   for those given here.
<P>
   To run SETUP, type the following at the MS-DOS prompt:
<P>
<P><PRE>      a:setup &lt;Bin dir&gt; &lt;Lib dir&gt; &lt;Include dir&gt; &lt;Samples dir&gt;
</PRE><P>
   where "a" is the letter representing your floppy disk drive. Also,
   replace each of the four directory parameters (shown above in angle
   brackets) with the fully qualified path name (including the hard
   disk drive letter) of the corresponding FORTRAN directory on your
   hard disk drive, as shown below:
<P>
<PRE>      Directory        FORTRAN Default       Directory Which
      Parameter        Directory Name        Represents the Location of
      ---------        ---------------       --------------------------

      &lt;Bin dir&gt;        c:\fortran\binb       MS-DOS executable files
      &lt;Lib dir&gt;        c:\fortran\lib        QuickWin combined library
      &lt;Include dir&gt;    c:\fortran\include    Include files
      &lt;Samples dir&gt;    c:\fortran\source\    Sample programs
                          samples

   If for the &lt;Samples dir&gt; parameter you specify the directory where
   your existing FORTRAN sample code is located, some of the new
   sample programs will overwrite previous versions of the programs.
   If you want to preserve the original versions of the sample code,
   you can create a new directory for the QuickWin Graphics sample
   programs, and specify that directory in place of your original
   samples directory.

   NOTE: It is required that you specify a drive letter before the
   "setup" command and each of the four directory parameters, and that
   you use fully qualified path names.

</PRE><P><LI>You do NOT need to restart your system for the update to take
   effect. Simply recompile your MS-DOS graphics applications as
   described in the QuickWin Graphics User's Guide.
<P>
   NOTE: SETUP will automatically back up your current QuickWin
   combined library LLIBFEW.LIB to LLIBFEW.BAK. If the new, updated
   library is working properly after SETUP is complete, you may delete
   the backup file to save space on your hard disk drive.
<P>

<P>
</OL><h3>SUPPLEMENTAL NOTES FOR THE QUICKWIN GRAPHICS USER'S GUIDE</h3>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Input Command From Window Menu Available for Graphics Child Windows</h3>
 
<P>
The QuickWin Graphics User's Guide states that the Input command (from
the Window menu) is unavailable to the user in QuickWin graphics
windows. The Input command is in fact available; when a Graphics Child
Window is waiting for input (upon a call to INCHARQQ), the Input
command gives focus to that window.
<P>
<P><h3>Drawing Rectangles 1 Pixel by 1 Pixel in Size Allowed</h3>
 
<P>
The QuickWin Graphics User's Guide states that it is not possible to
draw any graphics elements of only one pixel in size, except with the
setpixel routines. It is in fact possible to draw a 1x1 rectangle (as
is the case with MS-DOS programs using GRAPHICS.LIB).
<P>
<P><h3>Setting Out-of-Range Text Colors</h3>
 
<P>
Under GRAPHICS.LIB, if an out-of-range text color is requested in a
call to the settextcolor routine, the text color is set to the maximum
nonblinking color index. Under QuickWin Graphics, if an out of range
text color is requested, the text color is left unchanged.
<P>
<P><h3>Setting Text Colors on 256-Color Machines</h3>
 
<P>
The following applies only to computers capable of displaying 256
colors. Under GRAPHICS.LIB in a 256-color mode, the text color can be
set to any value from 0 to 255. Under QuickWin Graphics, values
greater than 31 are not allowed for text colors.
<P>
<P><h3>Drawing Lines with Lineto (or Lineto_w)</h3>
 
<P>
Under QuickWin Graphics, the final pixel specified by a lineto call is
not drawn. For example, assume the current position is (1,1). Then
the call: status = LINETO(4,4) will only set pixels (1,1), (2,2), and
(3,3). The new current position after the lineto call will be (4,4);
however, that pixel is not set by the lineto call.
<P>
<P><h3>Calling Rectangle (or Rectangle_w) with $Gfillinterior and a Fill Mask</h3>
 
<P>
If a call is made to one of the rectangle functions with the fill flag
set to $GFILLINTERIOR and a fill mask other than the default solid
mask, then the rectangle produced will be one pixel smaller than the
dimensions specified in the call. For example, a call which requests
a filled rectangle (using a non-solid fill mask) from (10,10) to
(20,20) produces a rectangle from (10,10) to (19,19).
<P>
<P><h3>Calling Floodfill (or Floodfill_w) Under Windows 3.1</h3>
 
<P>
If an area being floodfilled has part of its border lying along the
far-right border of the Logical Graphics Screen, the floodfill call
may not recognize that section of the border, allowing the fill
pattern to escape from its intended boundaries.
<P>
<P><h3>Calling Floodfill (or Floodfill_w) Under Windows 3.0</h3>
 
<P>
The floodfill routines work much slower under Windows 3.0 than under
Windows 3.1. Further, under Windows 3.0, neither of the floodfill
routines apply fill masks (i.e.: areas filled are always filled with
solid colors).
<P>
On systems with EGA adapters, graphics color #7 (white) is actually a
combination of two other colors (gray and bright white). Because of
this, any floodfill call (under Windows 3.0 and an EGA adapter) which
uses color #7 as either its boundary color or fill color produces
improper results. This also applies to any other such composite colors
which might be produced by non-standard graphics adapters.
<P>
<P><h3>EGA Text Color #7 Is the Same As Text Color #8</h3>
 
<P>
On systems with EGA adapters, text color #7 (white) actually appears
the same as text color #8 (gray).
<P>
<P><h3>Setting Text Colors on Machines with Monochrome Adapters</h3>
 
<P>
The following applies only to computers with monochrome graphics
adapters. Under GRAPHICS.LIB, calling settextcolor with the index of
any color other than black sets the text color to white. Under
QuickWin Graphics, only the following text color indices set the text
color to white: 7, 11, 13, 14, 15, 23, 27, 29, 30, 31.
<P>
<P><h3>Drawing Graphics Outside a Viewport Does Not Return 0</h3>
 
<P>
Under GRAPHICS.LIB, attempting to draw graphics elements which are
entirely outside a viewport yields a return code of 0 from the
graphics call. Under QuickWin Graphics, such calls return 1 (as if the
element had been successfully drawn).
<P>
Drawing Lines and Rectangles Past a GCW's Clipping Region with Monochrome
Adapters
 
<P>
The following applies only to computers with monochrome graphics
adapters. Drawing a line or rectangle which cannot be completely
contained in the current clipping region of the GCW when the call is
made causes incomplete results.
<P>
Returning from an Iconized GCW Being Viewed in Full Screen Mode After
Program Termination
 
<P>
If a program's active GCW is both iconized and being viewed in Full
Screen mode when the program terminates, the Escape key will not
revert back to the QuickWin Graphics application. Instead, a mouse
click must be used. The CTRL+ESC key sequence will also still bring up
the Windows Task List, allowing the program to be terminated from
there.
<P>
This is only applicable if a 'No' response is given to the 'Program
Terminated... Close Window?' message box which appears at the end of a
QuickWin Graphics application.
<P>
<P><h3>Linking NOIGNORECASE</h3>
 
<P>
You cannot link a QuickWin Graphics program with the NOIGNORECASE link
option (i.e.: /link /NOI). Doing so causes an Unresolved External
Linker error.
<P>
<P><h3>Calling YIELDQQ</h3>
 
<P>
If you make any calls to YIELDQQ within a loop, it is necessary to
compile your program with the /MW0 switch.
