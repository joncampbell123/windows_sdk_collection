The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft CodeView for MS-DOS, versions 2.3, 3.0, and 3.11
<LI>Microsoft CodeView for OS/2, versions 2.3, 3.0, and 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft CodeView versions 2.30, 3.00, and 3.11 erroneously calculate
the addresses of variables in FORTRAN COMMON blocks when these
variables are preceded in the COMMON block by 65,535 or more bytes of
data. The segment values of the addresses of these variables are
calculated incorrectly, generating incorrect results for any CodeView
function that uses symbolic names to display information. In
particular, watch-expressions will show incorrect values for the
contents of these variables.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
If viewing a specific data item is necessary, it should be moved to
the beginning of the COMMON block or placed in a separate COMMON
block. If this is not possible, the LOCFAR intrinsic function can be
used with FORTRAN versions 4.0, 4.01, 4.1, and 5.0 to print out the
correct memory address of the data item, which can then be used with a
CodeView dump command, a watchpoint, or a breakpoint to view the
required information.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in CodeView versions 2.3, 3.0, and
3.11 for MS-DOS and OS/2.
<P>
This is not an issue with FORTRAN PowerStation.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following program example illustrates the problem:
<P>
<P><h3>Sample Code</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>      parameter(n=65535)               ! 64K less one byte

      integer*1 arr1, arr2

      common /test/ arr1(n), arr2(10)

      arr1(1) = 1
      arr2(1) = 2

      write(*,'(a,z)') ' locfar(arr1) = ',locfar(arr1)
      write(*,'(a,z)') ' locfar(arr2) = ',locfar(arr2)

      end

</PRE>When running the above program under CodeView, the addresses displayed
for arr1 and arr2 are identical. This is because the offsets are
correctly calculated as zero, but the segment of arr2 is incorrectly
calculated as being the same as the segment of arr1. Consequently,
watch-expressions for the two variables display identical values.
<P>
Within CodeView, the offset of a variable preceded by 65,535 bytes in
a COMMON block is always correctly determined, but the segment address
is not. In the example above, if arr1 is increased in size, the memory
locations of the two arrays are no longer mapped directly on top of
each other by CodeView because the offsets will no longer be
identical.
<P>
CodeView does not appear to have a general problem with huge data
items or items in COMMON blocks. The problem only occurs with data
items in COMMON blocks when the starting address of the data item
begins on or beyond the boundary of the second segment of the COMMON
block. If a huge (greater than 64K bytes) data item has a starting
address in the first segment of the COMMON block, all the elements of
that data item are correctly displayed by CodeView.
