<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FORTRAN PowerStation for MS-DOS, version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The debugger does not highlight the current point of execution of an
include file containing executable statements.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The debugger does not recognize that the include file is in a
different source window. All lines in the include file are interpreted
by the debugger as being in the same window as the main source.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in FORTRAN PowerStation
version 1.0 for MS-DOS.  This problem has been resolved with FORTRAN
PowerStation maintenance release version 1.0a for MS-DOS.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
FORTRAN PowerStation version 1.0 can be differentiated from the
maintenance release version 1.0a by invoking the linker. Typing
"Link32 | more " from \F32\BIN directory will show version 2.8 for
FORTRAN PowerStation  version 1.0, and it will show version  1.0f
for the maintenance release version 1.0a.
<P>
To demonstrate the problem:

<OL><P><LI>Build the sample code with the project in debug mode.

<P><LI>Open a source window for both sample code files (note that the
   include file will not show up in the list of files associated with
   the project because the include statement has a label).

<P><LI>Single step; the current point will be line 1 of TEST.FOR.

<P><LI>Single step; the highlight showing the current point will be at
   line 2 of TEST.FOR, but the actual current point is line 12 of
   TEST.INC. The following will be printed to the F32 Debug window:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Main Line 1
</PRE>
<P><LI>Single step; the highlight showing the current point will be at
   line 3 of TEST.FOR, but the actual current point is line 13 of
   TEST.INC. The following will be printed:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Inc Line 2
</PRE>
<P><LI>Single step; line 4 of TEST.FOR is shown, but it actually is line
   14 of TEST.INC. The following will be printed:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Inc Line 3
</PRE>
<P><LI>Single step; line 5 of TEST.FOR is shown, and it actually is line 5
   of TEST.FOR! Both lines 4 of both TEST.INC and TEST.FOR were
   executed. The following will be printed:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Inc Line 4
      Main Line 4
</PRE><P>
</OL><h3>Sample Code (TEST.FOR)</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>  1   print *, 'Main Line 1'
</PRE></OL>c 2
<PRE>  3   include 'test.inc'
  4   print *, 'Main Line 4'
  5   end

</PRE><h3>Sample Code (TEST.INC)</h3>
 
<P>
c 11
<PRE>  12  print *, 'Inc Line 2'
  13  print *, 'Inc Line 3'
  14  print *, 'Inc Line 4'
</PRE>
