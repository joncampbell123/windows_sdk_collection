</PRE><h2>FORTRAN AND VISUAL BASIC FOR WINDOWS(TM)</h2>
 
<P>
There are several points to consider when using FORTRAN from Visual
Basic:

<UL><LI>Calling FORTRAN routines from Visual Basic for Windows requires
   that the FORTRAN routines be made into a DLL.

<LI>When passing data:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Both FORTRAN and Visual Basic pass data by reference.
    - Visual Basic strings are different from FORTRAN strings. They
      include a string structure, and require a special declaration
      ("ByVal") to force Visual Basic to pass the string pointer.
    - In Visual Basic, array indices start at 0. In FORTRAN, they
      start at 1.
</PRE>
<LI>There must be a declaration statement in Visual Basic for each
   FORTRAN routine that will be called.

<LI>FORTRAN DLLs have two significant problems in file I/O:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Unformatted or Binary files can't be accessed with FORTRAN
      commands.
    - ASCII files that are opened in FORTRAN will not be readable
      until you exit from Visual Basic.
</PRE><P>
   The solution to both problems is to use Windows API calls to do
   file I/O.
<P>
   NOTE: For additional information on file I/O, please see the
   following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../fortran/q102698.htm">Q102698</A></B>
<PRE>        TITLE: Performing File I/O from a FORTRAN Dynamic-Link Library

</PRE></UL><h2>CREATING A FORTRAN DLL CALLED FROM A VISUAL BASIC PROGRAM</h2>
 
<P>
This lab presents the steps required to build a FORTRAN DLL and shows how
to create a Visual Basic application that uses this DLL. This lab also
shows the syntax required to pass various types of data between FORTRAN and
Visual Basic.
<P>
<P><h3>Preparation</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Install FORTRAN version 5.1 to target 'MS-DOS and Windows' and
   include the Windows DLL library. When this is completed
   successfully, the files \FORTRAN\BINB\FL.DEF and
   \FORTRAN\LIB\LDLLFEW.LIB will be on your computer
<P>
   NOTE: If there are problems with any of this, please use the
   additional information provided in the following article in the
   Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../fortran/q112006.htm">Q112006</A></B>
<PRE>        TITLE: FORTRAN 5.1 Setup Procedure for Typical Installations

</PRE><P><LI>Install Visual Basic version 3.0.

<P><LI>Read chapters 1 and 2 of the "Visual Basic Programmers Guide," and do
   the "Hello World" example.
<P>
</OL><h3>Procedure</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start Visual Basic, and begin a new project.

<P><LI>Add the following items to the Form by dragging them from the Tool
   Box to the Form:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Four command buttons
    - One text box
</PRE>
<P><LI>In the Properties Window, modify the properties of the following items:
<P>
<PRE>   Object               Properties      Setting
