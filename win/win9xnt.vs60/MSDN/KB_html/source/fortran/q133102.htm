WINDOWS NT

<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FORTRAN PowerStation 32 for Windows NT, version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The following information is from the Microsoft FORTRAN PowerStation 32
README.TXT file located in the \FPSNT\README directory.
<P>
This file has four parts:
<P>
<PRE>     Part     Contents
     ----     --------
      1       Installation
      2       Debugging
      3       Building and Running Programs
      4       Miscellaneous

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
=======================&lt; Part 1: Installation &gt;========================
<P>
<P><h3>Installation and Windows NT User Accounts</h3>
 
Each user account in Windows NT has a key stored in the Registry.
This key contains the user profile and privilege level set by the
system administrator. If your user account group membership
(privileges) is changed after installation, the following two
messages may appear when starting FORTRAN Visual Workbench. After
these messages appear, FORTRAN Visual Workbench starts running.
However, when you exit you will receive the second message again.
<P>
<PRE> "The options Registry Key 'FORTRAN PowerStation' is missing. A new
  Registry Key will be created using the default settings."

 "Unable to write to the NT Registry. Option settings will not be
  saved."

</PRE>The FORTRAN Visual Workbench profile information, contained in the
Microsoft FORTRAN Visual Workbench key in the Windows NT registry,
contains both program-specific information such as environment
variables and user-specific information such as Editor options.
Each user on a Windows NT computer has a unique key for the
development environment, and that key cannot be shared on the same
machine.
<P>
Since the key cannot be shared, FORTRAN Visual Workbench must be
installed at the user level. If your user account belongs to more
than one group (Administrators, Backup Operators, Power Users,
Users, Guests, Replicators), and you install FORTRAN Visual
Workbench by running Setup as a member of Administrators, then you
only have access to FORTRAN Visual Workbench via your FORTRAN Visual
Workbench key when you are logged in the Admin group. If you intend
to work with FORTRAN Visual Workbench as a Power User, you must
install FORTRAN Visual Workbench as a Power User, and then use
FORTRAN PowerStation as a Power User. FORTRAN Visual Workbench
functionality cannot be spanned across user groups.
<P>
To correct this situation, a user with Administrator privileges on
your machine can perform the following steps to rebuild the Registry
Key for your user account:

<OL><P><LI>Log in as Administrator and give the User of FORTRAN PowerStation
   administrative privileges to delete the FORTRAN PowerStation entry,
   with RegEdit32 located in \winnt\system32 directory. The FORTRAN
   PowerStation entry is under HKEY_CURRENT_USER, Software, Microsoft,
   FORTRAN PowerStation. Be sure not to delete any entries other than
   FORTRAN PowerStation.

<P><LI>Remove the administrative privileges for the FORTRAN PowerStation
   User.

<P><LI>Log in as the User and start FORTRAN PowerStation again. This time
   you will only receive the first message from above and a new
   registry entry will be created.
<P>
<P>
</OL><h3>Installation over a Network</h3>
 
You can set up FORTRAN PowerStation for installation across a network:
<P>
1) Copy all of the disks to a directory tree on the network with the
<PRE>   directory names: ...\disk1, ...\disk2, and so on.

</PRE></OL>2) From the root of this directory tree, type: COPY DISK1\SETUP.*
<P>
3) You can now run Setup from the directory tree on the network.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Numerical Recipes and AUTOEXEC.BAT</h3>
 
The Numerical Recipes Setup program uses the directory ...\F32\BIN as
the default location for installing the NR files. (This is the directory
used for NR in FORTRAN PowerStation 32 for MS-DOS.) If you want to
install the NR files with the rest of FORTRAN PowerStation 32 for
Windows NT, change the destination directory to ...\FPSNT\BIN.
<P>
At the end of the installation process, the NR Setup program asks if you
want it to modify the AUTOEXEC.BAT file. (This is because it is the same
program that is used to install NR under MS-DOS.) Unless you intend to
run your programs in the MS-DOS environment, you should select the
option of not updating the AUTOEXEC.BAT file.
