program. The error message will reappear when opening more than 50 or
120 files at a time, depending on which object module the program is
linked with.

</PRE>The original versions of CRT0DAT.ASM and UNIT.ASM are located on the
distribution disks for Microsoft FORTRAN versions 5.0 and 5.1. The
exact locations of these files are shown in the PACKING.LST file
located on Disk 1, Setup. Page 405 of the "Microsoft FORTRAN
Reference" manual for both versions 5.0 and 5.1 describes the
modifications made to CRT0DAT.ASM and UNIT.ASM to increase the number
of file handles. The assembled versions of these two files,
CRT0DAT.OBJ and UNIT.OBJ, are included on the enclosed HF0304 disk for
use with large memory model FORTRAN 5.0 libraries. The files CRT0DATL
.OBJ and CRT0DATD.OBJ are included on the enclosed disk for use with
large memory model FORTRAN 5.1 Windows or Windows DLL libraries.

<P>
<P><h3>Increasing the Number of File Handles to 64 -- DOS or OS/2</h3>
 
<P>
The document FILEHAND.DOC, contained on the Microsoft FORTRAN version
5.1 distribution Disk 5, describes where to find the object modules on
the distribution disks to increase the number of file handles to 64
for both DOS and OS/2. The document also describes the process of
linking these object modules with the executable file.
<P>
<P><h3>Increasing the Number of File Handles to 64 -- Windows</h3>
 
<P>
The files CRT0DATD.OBJ and CRT0DATL.OBJ, shipped with Microsoft
FORTRAN version 5.1, may generate an L2029, L2044, or L2025 error
during link time when attempting to increase the number of file
handles to 64 for a Windows executable file. The files CRT0DATD.OBJ
and CRT0DATL.OBJ on the enclosed HF0304 disk are corrections for the
object modules shipped with Microsoft FORTRAN 5.1.

<OL><P><LI>Add the files CRT0DATL.OBJ and CRT0DATD.OBJ to your current
   directory. These files are located on the enclosed HF0304 disk in
   the \FORT510 directory.

<P><LI>Add the file UNIT.OBJ to your current directory. This file is
   located on the enclosed HF0304 disk in the \FORT510 directory.

<P><LI>Change the FILES=&lt;number&gt; line in your CONFIG.SYS file to read as
   follows:
<P>
<P><PRE>      FILES=64
</PRE><P>
   Add this line to your  CONFIG.SYS file if the line does not exist.
   Reboot the machine so the new FILES= statement takes effect.

<P><LI>Link the .OBJ files with the FORTRAN object code file to create a
   Windows executable file using the following statement
<P>
<P><PRE>      LINK /NOE &lt;QUUX.OBJ&gt; + UNIT.OBJ + CRT0DATL.OBJ;
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;QUUX.OBJ&gt; is the FORTRAN object code. Use CRT0DATD.OBJ in
   place of CRT0DATL.OBJ to create a Windows DLL.

<P><LI>Alternatively, for a more permanent change, you can replace these
   object modules in the run-time library as follows:
<P>
   a. To change the Windows run-time library, rename CRT0DATL.OBJ to
<P><PRE>      CRT0DAT.OBJ and type:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>         LIB LLIBFEW.LIB -+UNIT.OBJ -+CRT0DAT.OBJ;

   b. To change the Windows dynamic-linked library, rename
      CRT0DATD.OBJ to CRT0DAT.OBJ and type:

         LIB LDLLFEW.LIB -+UNIT.OBJ -+CRT0DAT.OBJ;
