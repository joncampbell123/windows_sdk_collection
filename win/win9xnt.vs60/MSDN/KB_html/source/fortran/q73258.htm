<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The following is the "Windows Programming" section from the FORTRAN
version 5.10 README.DOC:
<P>
<PRE>                            README.DOC File
              Release notes for the Microsoft(R) FORTRAN
             Professional Development System, Version 5.1

</PRE>This document contains release notes for version 5.1 of the Microsoft
FORTRAN Professional Development System for MS-DOS(R) and the
Microsoft Operating System/2 (MS(R) OS/2). The information in this
document is more up-to-date than that in the manuals and the Microsoft
Advisor (online help).
<P>
Microsoft improves its languages documentation at the time of
reprinting, so some of the information in this file may already be in
your manuals.
<P>
===========&lt; FORTRAN Programming with Microsoft Windows &gt;============
<P>
<P><h3>Requirement for Windows Dynamic-Link Libraries</h3>
 
<P>
All FORTRAN 5.1 dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) must explicitly export
the symbol WEP. To do this, the statement
<P>
<PRE>     EXPORTS
         WEP

</PRE>should be added to the DLL's module definition file. The WEP routine
is included in the FORTRAN 5.1 startup code. If a DLL already has a
user-defined WEP routine (for example, in a mixed-language DLL with
existing C code), the WEP routine should be renamed _WEP. The FORTRAN
5.1 startup code will call _WEP, if present, during DLL termination.
For additional information concerning the WEP function, see the
Windows 3.0 SDK documentation.
<P>
<P><h3>Close All Files Before Exiting a Windows DLL</h3>
 
<P>
When a Windows DLL written in FORTRAN terminates, any information
left in a file output buffer will be lost. This is a result of how
DLLs are terminated in Windows. To ensure that all data is written to
a file, explicitly CLOSE any open files in a DLL before the DLL is
terminated. One way of doing this is by adding a function to the DLL
code that closes all files, and calling this function just before the
application terminates.
<P>
MessageBox Support
 
<P>
FORTRAN supports two modes of MessageBox for QuickWin applications,
TASKMODAL and SYSTEMMODAL.  TASKMODAL requires that you respond to
the message box before the application will perform any further
calculations; however, all other applications currently running will
not be affected. SYSTEMMODAL requires you to respond before any
application may run.
<P>
<P><h3>Maximizing Windows</h3>
 
<P>
To maximize the frame window of a QuickWin application, place the
following statement in the WIN.INI file:
<P>
<PRE>     [&lt;appname&gt;]
     QWINMaximized=1

</PRE>where &lt;appname&gt; is the base name of your executable file. For
example, if the executable file is called PROGRAM.EXE, the value for
&lt;appname&gt; would be PROGRAM.
<P>
<P><h3>Windows DLLs and Subprograms with String Arguments</h3>
 
<P>
Don't pass char*(*) arguments to a subprogram residing in a Windows
DLL. This is because the runtime in the calling DLL or EXE cannot
communicate the length of the string with the runtime in the called
DLL.
<P>
*****************  NOTE: *****************
<P>
The above paragraph in the README.DOC contains an error. char*(*)
should be replaced by character*(*).
