The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FORTRAN PowerStation 32 for Windows NT, version 1.0 and
   4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Fortran PowerStation 32 was not designed to build applications that target
Win32s, nor has this capability been tested. Therefore, developing
Win32-based applications with Fortran PowerStation 32 that target Win32s
is not supported.
<P>
However, it is possible to create a Win32-based application that runs on
Win32s if you follow the guidelines for all applications that target
Win32s.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
There are many Win32 APIs that are not supported under Win32s. They will
return ERROR_CALL_NOT_IMPLEMENTED. The Win32 Programmer's Reference
identifies whether or not each Win32 API is supported under Win32s. As
long as you use only the Win32 APIs that are supported on Win32s, your
application should run on Win32s.
<P>
Fortran PowerStation 32 can create two kinds of applications: Console and
QuickWin (Standard Graphics is a disguised QuickWin). Win32s does not
support the Console API, so console applications are not an option under
Win32s. In addition, Fortran PowerStation 32 QuickWin libraries were not
restricted to the subset of Win32 APIs that are supported under Win32s.
Therefore, some functions and statements in a QuickWin application will
fail under Win32s.
<P>
We do not have a list of the things in a QuickWin application that will
fail under Win32s, so when you use QuickWin under Win32s, you use it at
your own risk.
<P>
The "Sample Code" in this article is an example of a program that does not
work as expected under Win32s. If the sample code is compiled with Fortran
PowerStation 32 using the /MW compile option (create QuickWin app) and run
under Windows NT, the following is displayed in a child window:
<P>
<PRE>   character * 20

</PRE>When the application is run under Win32s, this string is not displayed.
<P>
<P><h3>Sample Code</h3>
 
<P>
C Compile options needed: /MW
<P>
<PRE>      character * 20  ch20

      open (1,file='test.for')
      read (1,' (a)') ch20
      write(*,' (1x,a)') ch20
      close(1)
      stop
      end
