   version 4.0

<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
There is a problem in the Video Poker Game sample included with Microsoft
Fortran PowerStation 4.0. If you change a value of one of the scoring hands
payoff values in the Poker Paytable dialog box and press the ENTER key
while the changed payoff value edit box has the focus, the OK button
callback routine isn't called. Consequently, the changed payoff values are
not saved. This problem also occurs if you press the OK button's shortcut
keys (Alt+O).
<P>
The OK button's callback routine is called and the payoff values saved only
when the user clicks the OK button with the mouse or presses the TAB key to
move to the OK button and then presses the ENTER key.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The IDD_POKERPAY dialog box has two different OK buttons, one directly on
top of the other, and both are selected as the default button. The dialog
box manager is picking the IDOK2 (not visible) OK button when you exit the
dialog, but the callback function is expecting the other button IDCHECKOK
(visible) to be the default.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Remove the IDOK2 button from the IDD_POKERPAY dialog box. In Developer
Studio, with the Video Poker Game project open in the active workspace
select the Poker.rc file from the file viewer and open the IDD_POKERPAY
dialog. Once the dialog is open, highlight and drag the visible OK button
to one side (IDCHECKOK). This should reveal a second OK button hiding
directly underneath the first one (IDOK2). This is the button that must be
removed from the dialog. Select it, and delete it. After deleting the IDOK2
button, move the correct button (IDCHECKOK) back to its original location,
and rebuild the Video Poker Game project.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed
at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will
post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
