<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft provides a replacement for the MSRMT.DLL that is included with
version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows.
<P>
For complete information about obtaining and installing the MSRMT.DLL file,
see the following sections:

<UL><LI>To download the updated file
<LI>To update your MSRMT.DLL file
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This update contains MSRMT.DLL, a replacement for the MSRMT.DLL file that
is included with version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows. This
replacement file provides additional enhancements to the original MSRMT.DLL
file, correcting the following problems:

<UL><LI>External postoffices, SNADS DGNs, and nodes for PROFS and OfficeVision
   are not displayed in alphabetic order because Remote Mail for Windows
   reads them in one at a time and adds them to the address list
   hierarchy. With the updated version of MSRMT.DLL, Remote Mail for
   Windows reads in the external postoffices, SNADS DGNs, and PROFS nodes
   all at once, sorts them, and then adds them to the address list
   hierarchy.

<LI>The Windows Remote client may receive general-protection (GP) faults
   when it reads in a new message whose header within the .MAI file is
   greater than a certain length. The message is successfully downloaded
   from the postoffice to the Inbox .MBG file; however, it fails when it
   is read into the Mail message file (MMF). This problem has been fixed
   with version 3.2.4010 of MSRMT.DLL.

<LI>A message remaining in the Outbox could be misdirected if the remote
   address book was updated without uploading messages. The client will
   now check for the outbound messages prior to updating the address book.
   To ensure this fix works correctly, the following DLLs must be upgraded
   in conjunction with this DLL:
<P>
<P><PRE>      MSRMTCN.DLL  version 3.2.4013
      MSRMTSU.DLL  version 3.2.4013
      MSRMTTR.DLL  version 3.2.4013
      MSRMTUI.DLL  version 3.2.4013

   TITLE     : How to Obtain Microsoft Support Files from Online
               Services

</PRE>After you download MSRMT.EXE to a clean directory, run it (by typing
"msrmt" at the MS-DOS prompt) to extract the contents of the file.
You should receive the following files:
<P>
<PRE>   MSRMT.DLL    (234,544 bytes, dated 6-15-95, 6:21 P.M.)
   README.TXT

</PRE><h3>To update your MSRMT.DLL file</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Verify that the Microsoft Mail Remote driver (MSRMT.DLL) is the
   current driver in the Mail System Selector (MAILDRV.EXE) by running
   the Mail System Selector from the Windows Program Manager,
   selecting Microsoft Mail Remote, then choosing Set As Current Mail
   Driver.

<P><LI>At the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following and press ENTER
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy &lt;path&gt;:\msrmt.dll &lt;destination&gt;
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;path&gt; is the drive and directory where you ran the self-
   extracting MSRMT.EXE file and &lt;destination&gt; is the drive and
   directory where your MSRMT.DLL file currently resides. For example,
   if you ran the self-extracting file from the TEST directory on
   drive D, and your MSRMT.DLL file is located in the Windows SYSTEM
   subdirectory on drive C, type the following command:
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy d:\test\msrmt.dll c:\windows\system
