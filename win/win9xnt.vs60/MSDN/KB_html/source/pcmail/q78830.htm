The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 2.1e, 3.0, 3.0b, 3.2, 3.2a,
   and 3.5
</UL> 
<P>
Voice/Modem switches are used to detect incoming modem calls and direct
them to a modem while allowing voice calls to go to a telephone. By
default, the Microsoft Mail for PC Networks External Mail program
(EXTERNAL.EXE) uses reverse carrier to call all Call/Request users. Reverse
carrier causes the dialing modem to call out its carrier, rather than
waiting for the answering modem to speak first. This is necessary for
Voice/Data or Voice/Modem switches to work properly.
<P>
This is a feature of the External program; there is no way to turn it off.
However, some modems have a setting for how long to wait after the dial,
before calling out their handshake carrier. For example, a Microcom 2400
baud modem has an F7 setting. By setting that register to 30 in the modem
script, the carrier will sound immediately after the phone number is
dialed; increasing the register to 60 will delay the carrier several
seconds.
<P>
For more information about reverse carrier, see the owner's manual for your
modem.
<P>
For more information about changing script files, see Appendix N of the
Microsoft Mail "Administrator's Guide."
<P>
Microcom modems are manufactured by Microcom Systems, Inc., a vendor
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise,
regarding this product's performance or reliability.
