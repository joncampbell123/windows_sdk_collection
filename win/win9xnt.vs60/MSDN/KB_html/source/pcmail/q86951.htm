<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes the most common problems encountered when
installing the Microsoft Mail Gateway to 3Com 3+Mail.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Not Accepting Mail Service</h3>
 
<P>
If the installation program does not accept the three-part name of the
mail service, it could be the wrong name, an incorrect Ethernet
address, or a slow mail service.
<P>
Make sure the name entered is the full three-part name of the mail
service currently running. To find out the name of the mail service,
type "3m server=" at the MS-DOS prompt.
<P>
There may also be a problem with the 3+Mail service's Ethernet
address, if the Ethernet address of the mail service is different than
that of the server it is running on.
<P>
Check the Ethernet address of the server machine by doing one of the
following:

<UL><LI>Type "3n stat" on the server machine to display the Ethernet
   address of the server.

<LI>If the server is a dedicated 3Com server machine, open the panel on
   the front. There should be a sticker there with the address.

<LI>As a last resort, look on the network interface card.
<P>
</UL>Check the Ethernet address of the mail service by typing "3n mod
server" at a workstation. At the prompt, enter the full three-part
name of the mail service. Press ENTER to accept the first two
parameters. If the Ethernet address is different from that of the
server, change this address so that it matches the server.
<P>
Another situation where the installation program will not accept the
Mail Service is when the service is running very slow. The
installation program makes a call to the mail service APIs, with a
time limit. If the service is too slow, it will not respond in time,
and the installation will fail. You can try speeding up the mail
service by running the installation when there is nobody on the mail
system.
<P>
<P><h3>Re-Installing</h3>
 
<P>
Before re-installing the gateway, make sure to delete both the
_GATEWAY user ID and the domain:organization entered during the
installation. If the installation does not work, try deleting the
_GATEWAY user again, and also edit the MBXX file, which is in the
3MAIL directory in the 3Com database. You can edit this file using any
text editor. Delete the entry for the _GATEWAY user. Then delete the
domain:organization for the gateway. You now can try the install
again.
<P>
<P><h3>Installing from Floppy Disks</h3>
 
<P>
You must install the gateway from floppy disks; you cannot copy the
files to a hard drive and install them from there.
<P>
<P><h3>Gateway Directory</h3>
 
<P>
The directory where the gateway files will be installed must be
created before the installation; otherwise, the installation will
fail.
<P>
<P><h3>Domain:Organization for Gateway</h3>
 
<P>
The domain:organization for the _GATEWAY user must be unique.
