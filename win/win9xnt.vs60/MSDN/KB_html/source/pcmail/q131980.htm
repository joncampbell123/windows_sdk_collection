The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.2 and 3.2a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you create a message in versions 3.2 and 3.2a of Microsoft Mail for
Windows with over 350 addresses in the To: line or enough addresses to span
a printed page, and one or more addresses in the Cc: line with information
in the Subject: field, and text typed in the body of the message, the
following may occur:

<UL><LI>The addresses that would span the printed page are missing on the
   printed page.

<LI>The addresses on the Cc: line are missing.

<LI>The text that was typed in the Subject: line is missing.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The To: address line will not except carriage return control characters. It
will see them as an invalid address.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
You can create a Personal Group of individual addresses and print that
group for record keeping.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions 3.2 and 3.2a of
Microsoft Mail for Windows. We are researching this problem and will post
new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
