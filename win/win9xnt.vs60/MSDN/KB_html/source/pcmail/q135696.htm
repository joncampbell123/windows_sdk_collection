<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail Gateway to FAX, version 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article contains information on how to configure PureData SatisFAXtion
Modem 400i or 200i with Microsoft Mail Gateway to FAX running on a MS-DOS
gateway computer.
<P>
The steps required to properly set up the SatisFAXtion Modem 400i and 200i
fax devices and an installation overview of the Mail Gateway to FAX have
been included.
<P>
NOTE: This article assumes that version 3.x of Microsoft Mail for PC
Networks has been installed.
<P>
PUREDATA SATISFAXTION MODEM 400I AND 200I BOARDS
<P>
The PureData SatisFAXtion Modem 400i and 200i boards are internal facsimile
modems; they function as both a fax and a data modem. These devices can be
operated in the following modes:

<UL><LI>Command mode (+++). This is also called terminal mode. This mode
   interprets any data sent to it as one or more modem commands.

<LI>Data mode (AT0). This is also called on-line mode. After a connection
   is made to the remote computer, this mode will relay the data you
   send it.
<P>
</UL>The SatisFAXtion Modems interface with the gateway computer system to
function as independent computer-based facsimile sub-systems equipped with
the ability to invoke background operations and broadcasting (group sends
of one to many faxes).
<P>
The differences between the two models of SatisFAXtion cards are reflected
by their transmission rates: SatisFAXtion Modem 400i transfers at a rate of
14400 bits per second (bps) and the SatisFAXtion Modem 200i transfers at
the rate of 9600 bps and has a slight variance in the extended fax
protocols supported.
<P>
<P><h3>To get the PureDATA SatisFAXtion hardware</h3>
 
<P>
PureData fax boards are available from computer dealers and distributors in
several countries. You can get product availability and additional
information from PureData at (800) 661-8210.
<P>
SATISFAXTION MODEM 400i/200i HARDWARE
<P>
<P><h3>To install SatisFAXtion modem boards</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Turn off the power to the gateway computer. Remove the cover, and
   touch the power supply to dissipate built-up static charge. Install
   the card into an available (preferably 16-bit) slot.

<P><LI>With the board level in hand, guide it into the add-in slot. The
   metal bracket on the board fits into the area formerly occupied by
   a blank plate. Ensure that the phone connector on the board is not
   obstructed. It may be necessary to loosen the fax card's mounting
   screw and reposition it if the telephone jack cannot be easily inserted.
<P>
</OL><h3>To check the telephone line</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Locate an available telephone. Remove the cord from the wall and
   insert it into the jack you intend to use for the Fax Gateway. Pick up
   the receiver, and after you check for normal dial-tone, dial the number
   of another fax device. If the remote device answers the telephone, you
   should hear the standard modem handshake. After you receive the
   handshake tone, hang up the telephone.

<P><LI>With the telephone still connected to the Fax Gateway's telephone
   jack, call the fax number from another telephone; if it rings, the
   number for the board is correct.
<P>
</OL>SATISFAXTION SOFTWARE
<P>
When the SatisFAXtion board and telephone connections are properly
installed, you are ready to install the SatisFAXtion software.
<P>
<P><h3>To install the SatisFAXtion software</h3>
 
<P>
NOTE: The Setup program copies files you need to fax. When you are
prompted, direct these files to a subdirectory called PUREDATA of your
postoffice located on the server. Create this directory prior to beginning
the Setup program.

<OL><P><LI>Turn on your computer. Make a net connection to the network server
   where the Microsoft Mail for PC Networks postoffice is located. This
   subdirectory is commonly named \MAILDATA. Your command prompt should be
   at the root of this share or subdirectory.

<P><LI>From the \MAILDATA directory create a subdirectory called PUREDATA.
   This directory will be used to copy the SatisFAXtion installation
   files to as part of the initial stage of the SatisFAXtion board
   setup process.

<P><LI>Insert the PureData SatisFAXtion software Disk 1 into the appropriate
   disk drive. At the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following and
   press ENTER:
<P>
<P><PRE>      *:setup
</PRE>
<P><LI>Press any key to leave the title screen, then select Continue.
   Questions about specific field definitions can be addressed by using
   Help.

<P><LI>From the Options menu, choose Copy SatisFAXtion software. Press ENTER.
<P>
   NOTE: The Setup program will assume a local destination PATH that
   you may need to override to point to the correct subdirectory on
   the Mail server, (for example, M:\MAILDATA\ PUREDATA). On screen
   instructions will prompt you through the installation process.

<P><LI>Press the F10 key to accept the user preferences. When all the files
   have been copied from the disks, the Options menu will be displayed
   once again.
<P>
</OL>First-time Setup:
<P>
Set the COM port and interrupt (IRQ) setting using the First-time Setup
option. If the installation program is unable to select a COM port and an
IRQ setting, the selection of an invalid I/O and IRQ will cause the machine
to hang.
<P>
If you experience conflicts, consult the SatisFAXtion "Installation and
Setup Guide."

<OL><P><LI>From the Options menu, choose First-time Setup. As prompted, fill in
   the requested information.

<P><LI>Press the F10 key to accept the First-time Setup options when you
   are done. If there are any problems during the Setup process, consult
   the SatisFAXtion "Installation and Setup Guide."
<P>
</OL>Notes:

<UL><LI>To view the available options, highlight Set up Standard Software
   Options and press ENTER. This option will configure the COM and IRQ
   settings of the board. If you experience conflicts when you accept
   the settings, consult the "Installation Guide."

<LI>After you have installed the software, refer to the "To set up the
   hardware" section below to manually set the COM ports and IRQs for the
   modem and fax.

<LI>After you exit the Set Up Hardware option, do not re-select the First-
   time Setup option because the Setup program will try to reassign the
   same invalid I/O settings you are trying to change.
<P>
</UL><h3>To complete the registration form</h3>
 
<P>
The Setup program gives you the option to register your hardware.

<OL><P><LI>From the Options menu, choose Register Your SatisFAXtion FaxModem.

<P><LI>Complete the registration form as prompted, and press the F10 key
   to accept it.
<P>
</OL>Advanced Setup:

   option when you want to ensure that original settings allow proper
   FaxModem operations or to change the settings that conflict when
   they were auto assigned when you exited First-time Setup.

<P><LI>From the Options for Incoming Calls option, designate whether your
   FaxModem will share its telephone line. Next, determine the number of
   rings before pick-up, and set the Fax Auto Answer option to On.
<P>
   NOTE: It is recommended that the telephone line be dedicated.

<P><LI>From the Set Up Standard Software option, select No for Cover Page,
   and set the Fax Resolution to Standard.

<P><LI>From the Set Up Pop-up Options option, set the Fax Capture Pop-up
   Port to Off.

<P><LI>From Set Up Technical Software Options option, set the Number (#) of
   Redial Retries to three (3). Set the Line Compensation to zero (0) and
   the Default Dial Mode to Tone.
<P>
   Notes:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - The default Number of Redial Retries is three.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - When you optimize performance of gateway machine, set the option
      CASMGR EMS Usage to use EMS, if available.
</PRE><P>
</OL><h3>To update the gateway computer and exit</h3>

      M:\MAILDTAT\PUREDATA\CASMGR.CFG
      M:\MAILDATA\PUREDATA\FAXTSR.EXE
</PRE><P>
   It will also suggest the following lines be added to the CONFIG.SYS
   file:
<P>
<P><PRE>      DEVICE= M:\MAILDATA\ PUREDATA\SATISFAX.SYS IOADDR=0350
      BUFFERS=15 and FILES=20.
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: The modifications to these files are detailed in the next
   section and need to be made prior to testing the operation state of
   the SatisFAXtion board.

<P><LI>Underneath the suggested file modifications, you will be prompted
   to choose Update to update the files automatically or Quit to exit
   without updating. Select the Quit option to return to the command
   prompt.
<P>
</OL><h3>To modify the startup files</h3>
 
<P>
After you install the SatisFAXtion software, you will need to modify the
startup files of the gateway computer. The following steps will allow you
to load CASMGR when the gateway computer is turned on or rebooted.

<OL><P><LI>At the MS-DOS command prompt, change to the root of the local drive
   of the gateway computer, and create a subdirectory called FAX. Change
   to this directory, which should appear as C:\FAX.

<P><LI>Copy the following files from the M:\..\MAILDATA\SATISFAX suddirectory:
<P>

PUREDATA MAINTENANCE AND TROUBLESHOOTING
<P>
To ensure that disk space is available and to optimize overall performance,
you will need to periodically do file maintenance on the gateway computer.
<P>
The PureDATA CAS drivers will generate concurrent log file entries to track
activity for each send or receive fax transmission. These files are created
in the \..\PUREDATA directory, and you can view the log files by running
the fax from the directory.
<P>
You can also delete the entries by selecting the Events Status option, then
select the Logged Events and delete a single entry or Purge All.
<P>
MICROSOFT MAIL GATEWAY TO FAX (VERSION 3.X)
<P>
After you have completed the steps above, you can install the Microsoft
Mail Gateway to FAX and Gateway Access components. The gateway postoffice
requires both the Gateway and Gateway Access component of the Mail Gateway
to FAX. A postoffice forwarding and receiving faxes from a gateway
postoffice is considered to be a downstream; thus, it only requires the
Mail Gateway Access to FAX component.
<P>
<P><h3>To install the Mail Gateway to FAX and Access Component</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Insert the Gateway Component disk into the disk drive, and run
   the INSTALL.EXE program. Follow the screen prompts to complete
   the installation.

<P><LI>Insert the Gateway Access Component disk into the disk drive, and
   run the INSTALL.EXE program. Follow the screen prompts to complete
   the installation.
<P>
</OL><h3>To configure Mail Gateway to FAX with PROFILE.EXE</h3>
 
<P>
NOTE: It is crucial to run PROFILE.EXE, and edit a file named PROFILE.GLB
in order to match your network environment.

<OL><P><LI>Type the following command and press ENTER to run the PROFILE.EXE
   from the \MAILEXE directory:
<P>
<P><PRE>      profile -d&lt;m&gt;
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;m&gt; represents the network drive of the postoffice.
<P>
</OL>You will need to select the following options that correspond directly to
previous configuration choices you made when you installed the SatisFAXtion
software earlier:

<UL><LI>Set the Redial Times to 3. The default value is 3.

<LI>For the Logo File option, ensure the physical location of
   FAXLOGO3.PCX (the default name) is correct, or enter an alternative
   path to a different logo, PCX image, or file of your choice.

<LI>Ensure that the physical Printer Path is present and correct. This entry
   should point to the drive or directory location of PPB.EXE, a spooler
   program associated with the Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, MS-DOS
   workstation. It spools incoming faxes to a local or redirected printer
   when FAXin Mode is set to spool or view and spool
<P>
   NOTE: At this time, you may need to install the Mail for PC Networks,
   MS-DOS workstation.

<LI>Set the Printer Port option to point to the correct local or redirected
   printer port, for example, LPT1: or LPT2:.

<LI>Set the Fax Resolution to normal, not fine.

<LI>Set the Attachment Check to Yes.

<LI>Select Intel as the Fax Board type.
<P>
   NOTE: This setting is towards the bottom of the configuration
   file, PROFILE.GLB.
<P>
</UL>All remaining options in this Setup screen are optional, and you should
proceed to complete the installation.
<P>
For additional information on installing the Microsoft Mail Gateway and
Gateway Access to Fax and configuring PROFILE.GLB using PROFILE.EXE, please
