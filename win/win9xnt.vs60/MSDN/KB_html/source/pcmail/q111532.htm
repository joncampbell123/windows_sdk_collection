</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft provides a replacement for the SETUP.EXE, CMDKINST.EX_, and
USERINST.EX_ files that are included on Disk 1 of version 1.0 of Microsoft
Electronic Forms Designer.
<P>
For complete information about obtaining and installing the SETUP.EXE,
CMDKINST.EX_, and USERINST.EX_ files, see the following sections:

<UL><LI>To download the updated files
<LI>To replace your E-Forms setup files
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This update contains SETUP.EXE, CMDKINST.EX_, and USERINST.EX_, which
replace the files included on Disk 1 of version 1.0 of Microsoft Electronic
Forms Designer. The replacement files provide additional enhancements to
the original setup files.
<P>
These replacement files resolve the following problems that can occur
when you use version 1.0 of Electronic Forms Designer:

<UL><LI>When you are using Server Setup or User Setup to install to a
   shared Windows environment, the Setup program may generate errors
   when it is attempting to copy files.

<LI>When you are using User Setup to install to a shared Windows
   environment, the Setup program may copy unnecessary files to the
   user's private Windows directory.

<LI>When you are installing on a Novell(R) network where the Map Root
   command was used to attach a drive, the Server Setup and User Setup
   programs may generate errors indicating that various files could
   not be found.

</PRE><h3>To replace your E-Forms setup files</h3>
 
<P>
To replace the E-Forms setup files, you will need to copy the files
included with this update to Disk 1 of the Electronic Forms
Designer.
<P>
Two of the files included with this update are compressed to
match their original format on the disk. After the files have been
replaced on the floppy disk, you can run the Server Setup program to
reinstall the Electronic Forms Designer. It is not recommended that
these files be manually decompressed and copied to existing
installations. See page 123 of the Electronic Forms Designer
"Developer's Guide" for more information on using the Server Setup and
User Setup programs.
<P>
At the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following and press ENTER
<P>
<PRE>   copy &lt;drive1&gt;:\*.* &lt;drive2&gt;

</PRE>where &lt;drive1&gt; is the drive and directory where you ran the self-
extracting EFSETUP.EXE file and &lt;drive2&gt; is the drive containing
the Electronic Forms Designer Disk 1. For example, if you ran the
self-extracting file from the TEST directory on drive D, and the
Electronic Forms Designer Disk 1 is in drive B, type the following
command:
<P>
<PRE>   copy d:\test\*.* b:\

</PRE><h3>Additional Notes on Installing to Shared Windows Environments</h3>
 
<P>
Before running Server Setup in a shared Windows environment, the
administrator must have read/write access to the Windows SYSTEM
subdirectory. (Normally, this is a read-only directory.) Once the
files have been installed by Server Setup, the users can install
Electronic Forms Designer to their private Windows directories using
the User Setup program.
<P>
In addition, if a new version of a support file is placed in the
shared Windows directory, and not in the E-Forms Server Setup
directory, the User Setup program will fail due to inconsistent
versions. To avoid errors, it is important for the versions of the
support files in the E-Forms Server Setup directory (the default is
ADDONS\EFORMS) to be the same as those in the shared Windows
directory.
