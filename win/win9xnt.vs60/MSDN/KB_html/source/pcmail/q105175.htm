The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, when a
user tries to move the Mail message file (MMF) from the postoffice to
the local computer (or vice versa), the following error message may be
displayed:
<P>
<PRE>   Mail failed to relocate your message file

</PRE>This error message may occur if there is insufficient free disk space
on the target drive or if the MSMAIL.INI file is marked as Read Only.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
If there is insufficient disk space, you can resolve the problem by
freeing disk space on the target drive.
<P>
If the MSMAIL.INI file is marked as Read Only, simply changing the
properties of the MSMAIL.INI file will not resolve the problem. After
changing the properties of the MSMAIL.INI file, another error message
will be displayed the next time the user logs into the Windows client:
<P>
<PRE>   Your message file could not be found

</PRE>The user is then prompted for the location of an .MMF file.
<P>
Mail for Windows uses the MSMAIL.INI file to write intermediate
information while the .MMF file is being transferred. Because the
MSMAIL.INI file is marked Read Only, this information cannot be
written and hence the error occurs. Even though the .MMF file was not
relocated, the ACCESS3.GLB file was changed to reflect the intended
new location.
<P>
If the .MMF file is on the postoffice, perform the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Determine the user's 8-digit ID number. You can determine this
   number in one of two ways:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Use USRDUMP.EXE or LISTUSER.EXE.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - Log in to the MS-DOS client and move the user's folders to
      Private-Storage. This creates an .IDX file with the same
      filename as the user's 8-digit ID. After the user's ID has been
      determined, the user's private folders should be moved back to
      the server.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Copy the user's .MMF file (&lt;user's 8 digit ID&gt;.MMF) from the MMF
   directory on the postoffice to the user's local computer.
<P>
   The exact location of the .MMF file is now known.

<P><LI>Start Microsoft Mail. After the user signs in, the following error
   message is displayed:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Your Message file could not be found
</PRE><P>
   The Open Message File dialog box will then be displayed.

<P><LI>Select the correct .MMF file.
<P>
</OL>The user should now be able to move the .MMF file to or from local
storage.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The LISTUSER utility is included with Application Note WA0641, "Database
Maintenance Utilities." You can have this Application Note mailed or faxed
to you by contacting Microsoft Product Support Services.
