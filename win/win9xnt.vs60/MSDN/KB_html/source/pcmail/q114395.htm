The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2
</UL> 
<P>
You may receive Notice 40 error messages while performing a variety of
Microsoft Mail administrative tasks, most commonly when adding or removing
users. The Notice 40 message is difficult to troubleshoot because it can be
caused by several different problems ranging from corrupted files to
network incompatibility issues. In the section below, "Troubleshooting
Notice 40 Error Messages," many possible causes and workarounds are listed.
<P>
<P><h2>TROUBLESHOOTING NOTICE 40 ERROR MESSAGES</h2>
 
<P>
You may receive a Notice 40 error message when you import or export address
lists. The actual text of the Notice 40 message may be different, depending
on what administrative task has failed. For example, when you add a new
user, this text follows the Notice 40 error:
<P>
<PRE>   Error in sending updated users and groups

</PRE>If you get a Notice 40 error after attempting to delete a user, this text
follows:
<P>
<PRE>   Deletion failed, messages queued to MTA

</PRE>The following list contains possible causes and resolutions for Notice 40
error messages. The list is organized roughly by probability: the most
common causes of this error are listed first.
<P>
<P><h3>Problems Accessing the REQTRANS.GLB File</h3>
 
<P>
Problems accessing the REQTRANS.GLB file occur only if the user you are
adding or removing, or the postoffice you are working with, are taking part
in directory synchronization (Dir-Sync). Before troubleshooting any
further, try adding a new mail account without choosing to include the user
in Dir-Sync. If the Notice 40 error still occurs, troubleshoot the problem
further, using one of the sections below.
<P>
If the Notice 40 error seems to be related to Dir-Synch, the Mail
Administrator program is likely having problems opening and modifying the
REQTRANS.GLB file. This file stores the changes to the Postoffice Address
List.
<P>
Because of a network issue, the Mail Administrator program may not be able
to access the REQTRANS.GLB file. In general, network rights problems
anywhere in the postoffice can cause Notice 40 errors. (See the Postoffice
Directory or File Problems section below.) One specific case involves LAN
Manager for UNIX. This problem has been attributed to version 2.1a of NCR's
LAN Manager for UNIX. There is a patch available from NCR called "Microsoft
Mail Notice-40 Patch." If you are running LAN Manager for UNIX, regardless
of the hardware platform, it may be helpful to contact your hardware vendor
to see if they are aware of this problem.
<P>
NOTE: As a temporary resolution to this problem, you can disable all Dir-
Sync. You can update Postoffice Address Lists manually until you solve the
problem by using the External Mail program. However, the External Mail
program does not respect the Dir-Sync flag, so groups and users who are not
set up for Dir-Sync will be sent to other postoffices.
<P>
<P><h3>Low Conventional Memory</h3>
 
<P>
You may be able to avoid Notice 40 errors by increasing the amount of
conventional memory available to the Mail Administrator program. Try
loading fewer terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) programs and drivers in
your AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS files. If you are running the Mail
Administrator program from an MS-DOS command prompt under the Microsoft
Windows operating system, try running it before starting Windows.
<P>
<P><h3>Postoffice Directory or File Problems</h3>
 
<P>
Notice 40 errors can be caused if any of the following are true about your
postoffice files and directory structure:

<UL><LI>There are not enough network rights or permissions on the directory
   structure or its files. You should have full access to all the
   directories and files in the postoffice. If it is feasible, you can test
   for network rights problems by moving the postoffice directory structure
   to a local hard disk drive. If the problem recurs, you'll know it had
   nothing to do with network rights.
<P>
   NOTE: If you do move the postoffice, make sure you use the XCOPY command
   (with the /S, /V, and /E parameters) because many of the directories and
   files are empty but still need to exit for the postoffice to function
   correctly.

<LI>There are missing postoffice directories. There are 19 subdirectories in
   the postoffice; they all need to exist even if they are empty. You can
   re-create the full postoffice directory structure by running Setup and
   choosing the Update an Existing Postoffice option. When asked if you
   want to update the database, choose Yes.

<LI>There are missing MAI postoffice directories. When you create a new
   user in Admin, one of the processes is to send that new user a welcome
   message. This welcome message is created as a .MAI file and put into
   the appropriate directory under the MAI directory. The MAI directory
   contains 16 subdirectories. If the Notice 40 is occurring with EVERY
   new user being created, then it is possible that none of these
   directories exist. If the Notice 40 occurs randomly, then it is possible
   that only one of the MAI subdirectories is missing.

<LI>The Access files are corrupted. To check this, divide each Access file
   size by its associated record size:
<P>
<PRE>      File          Record Size
      -------------------------
      ACCESS.GLB       586
      ACCESS2.GLB       69
      ACCESS3.GLB      512

</PRE></UL><h3>Software Version Incongruities</h3>
 
<P>
Notice 40 error messages can be caused by running different versions of the
Mail software (for example, if you are running version 3.0 of the Mail
Administrator program on a version 2.1 postoffice).
<P>
<P><h3>Corrupted NME Files</h3>
 
<P>
Notice 40 error messages may appear if either the ADMIN.NME or ADMINSHD.NME
file is corrupted. If you suspect this to be true, make a backup copy of
each of these files and then copy ADMIN.NME over ADMINSHD.NME.
