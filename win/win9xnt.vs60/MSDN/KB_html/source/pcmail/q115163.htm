The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.2
</UL> 
<P>
You can set up Microsoft Mail for PC Networks on a Novell 3.11 file server
in such a way that any valid Mail user can automatically log in to his or
her own Mail and Schedule+ accounts from any configured PC workstation,
based on his or her Novell login.
<P>
<P><h2>BASIC REQUIREMENTS</h2>
 

<UL><LI>Each user's Novell login name must match his or her mailbox name.

<LI>Each user's Mail message file (MMF) must be stored on the file server.

<LI>The ServerPath= line in the [Microsoft Mail] section of the MSMAIL.INI
   file must be the same on each workstation. It must be based on
   consistent default drive mappings to each user's Mail database,
   regardless of the Novell home server or which postoffice a user resides
   on.

<LI>Each user must have his or her own home directory on the server, with a
   consistent drive and path that is identical for every user.
<P>
   NOTE: This requirement is only needed for Schedule+.
<P>
</UL><h2>SETUP</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>File Server(s)</h3>
 
<P>
Add a routine similar to the following to your system login script so that
an MS-DOS environmental variable containing the user's Novell Login
Name/Microsoft Mail Mailbox Name gets set when each user first logs in to
his or her home server. This variable will be used to pass the user's name
to MAIL.EXE, MSMAIL.EXE, or SCHDPLUS.EXE when you start the executable
file.
<P>
NOTE: You will need to adjust the following routine to match your own
system.
<P>
<PRE>    IF MEMBER OF "pcmail" THEN
       DOS SET Mailbox="%LOGIN_NAME"
       MAP ROOT R:=Server15/SYS:apps\mail
    END

</PRE><h3>Workstations</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Each workstation must have sufficient MS-DOS environment space available
   to store up to a 10-digit variable and its name. Modify each
   workstation's CONFIG.SYS file if you need to do so to increase the
   command processor's environmental block. In most cases, 1024 (as shown
   below) is adequate; however, specific values will depend on your own
   configuration.
<P>
<P><PRE>      SHELL=C:\DOS\COMMAND.COM C:\DOS\ /e:1024 /p
</PRE>
<P><LI>Log a workstation back into the Novell server and verify that step 1
   is working properly. After you log in, type SET from an MS-DOS prompt.
   If your Novell login name was JohnDoe, you should see the following
   line:
<P>
<P><PRE>      MAILBOX=JohnDoe
</PRE><P>
</OL><h3>MS-DOS Clients</h3>
 
<P>
Create an MSMAIL.BAT file similar to the following, but adjust it for your
own configuration.
<P>
<PRE>   @Echo Off
   cd r:\data
   r:\exe\mail %mailbox% -dr

</PRE></OL><h3>Windows Clients</h3>
 
<P>
Modify the Command Line field in the Microsoft Mail icon's Program Item
Properties box (by selecting the icon and then pressing ALT+ENTER) to be
similar to the following example:
<P>
<PRE>   c:\msmail\msmail.exe %mailbox%

</PRE><h3>Schedule+ Clients</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Modify the Command Line field in the Microsoft Schedule+ icon's Program
   Item Properties box to be similar to the following example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      c:\schdplus\schdplus.exe %mailbox%
</PRE>
<P><LI>Assuming all users' home directories are at the root of drive H, move
   and rename all users' local calendar files (*.CAL) to the H:\LOCAL.CAL
   subdirectory.

<P><LI>Modify the LocalPath= line in the [Microsoft Schedule+] section of each
   workstation's SCHDPLUS.INI file to read as follows:
<P>
<P><PRE>      LocalPath= h:\local.cal
