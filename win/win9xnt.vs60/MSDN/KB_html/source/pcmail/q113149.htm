The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you access shared or group folders and you select or double-click a
shared folder, the following error message may appear:
<P>
<PRE>   A folder could not be accessed

</PRE>In addition, when you try to delete a shared folder, the following error
message may appear:
<P>
<PRE>   The folder could not be completely deleted.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When a private, shared, or group folder is created, it is given a unique ID
number. This unique number is generated from the SERIALNO.IDX file. The
Microsoft Mail MS-DOS workstation can access folder names from 00000000.FLD
through FFFFFFFF.FLD. Microsoft Mail for Windows should be able to access
the same range of shared and group folders; however, it can only access
folder names from 00000000.FLD through 00FFFFFF.FLD. When a shared or group
folder has an ID number of 01000000 or greater, the Windows client displays
the above error message.
<P>
The MS-DOS client has no problem with folder names in this range.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
The following is a temporary workaround that allows you to access shared
and group folders that can't be accessed by the Windows client:
<P>
<P><h3>Reset SERIALNO.IDX to 00 00 00 00</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create a backup copy of and run DEBUG on a backup of the SERIALNO.IDX
   file. For example, type:
<P>
<P><PRE>      debug serialno.idx
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: Perform this operation on the backup only.

<P><LI>At the hyphen (-) prompt, type the following and then press ENTER to
   display the value of the counter:
<P>
<P><PRE>      d100 103
</PRE><P>
   The following is an example of a bad counter value:
<P>
<P><PRE>      xxxx:0100 3C 56 4F 4D
</PRE><P>
   This is equivalent to a folder name of 4D4F563C.FLD, which is out of the
   Windows client range.

<P><LI>To correct the bad counter value, reset the count back to 00000000 by
   typing the following and then pressing ENTER:
<P>
<P><PRE>      f 100,103,0
</PRE>
<P><LI>To verify that the values are reset to zeros, type the following at the
   hyphen prompt:
<P>
<P><PRE>      d100 103
</PRE>
<P><LI>To save the corrections, type W at the hyphen prompt. The following
   message will appear:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Writing 00004 bytes
</PRE><P>
   This message indicates that the data was written to the file.

<P><LI>At the hyphen prompt, type Q to quit DEBUG.
<P>
</OL>These steps will fix the out-of-range folder counter generator. If a folder
already exists with the value in the SERIALNO.IDX file, the Mail program
will not reuse the number.

<OL><P><LI>Copy the newly modified SERIALNO.BAK over the original SERIALNO.IDX.
<P>
</OL><h3>Recover the Problem Folder</h3>
 
<P>
The owner or creator of the shared and group folders should perform the
following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Use the Microsoft Mail MS-DOS client to create a temporary working
   folder. Move the mail message from the problem folder to the temporary
   folder.

<P><LI>Delete the problem folder and then re-create it. Because the
   SERIALNO.IDX file has been reset to zero, a new folder will have the
   folder-name number within the range the Windows client can handle.

<P><LI>Move the mail message back to the original folder.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2
of Microsoft Mail for Windows. We are researching this problem and will
post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
