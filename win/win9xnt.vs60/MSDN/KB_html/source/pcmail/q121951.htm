The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0 and 3.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
A user's Personal Address Book (PAB) does not get updated if one of the
users in the PAB moves to a different postoffice.
<P>
For example, suppose user A has user X in his or her PAB. User X then moves
to a different postoffice, directory synchronization (Dir-Sync) runs, and
the Global Address List (GAL) is rebuilt. User A still has user X's old
address in his or her PAB and needs to re-add user X from the GAL.
<P>
If user A creates a group (without re-adding X in his PAB) and adds user X
from the GAL to this group; the group still gets the old address from the
PAB even though user X's name was selected from the GAL.
<P>
It does not matter whether User X was moved by using the MOVEUSER utility
or by importing his or her Mail message file (MMF) in the new postoffice.
<P>
This applies problem occurs with both the MS-DOS and the Windows Mail
clients.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2
of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks. We are researching this problem and will
post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base when it becomes
available.
