The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0 and 3.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
With versions 3.0 and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, directory
synchronization (Dir-Sync) provides a "run window" that allows the Dir-Sync
process to begin, even though the start time has already passed. For
example, it is possible for the run window entries to be both 4 hours and 8
hours.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The scheduling information for Dir-Sync is contained in the PROCESS.GLB
file. This file contains the time and date of the next scheduled activity
for each day. If this PROCESS.GLB file was originally created for version
3.0 of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks and modified with version 3.0 of the
Mail Administrator program (ADMIN.EXE), the run window will be 4 hours. If
the PROCESS.GLB file was later modified with version 3.2 of the ADMIN.EXE
program (after the postoffice was upgraded), the modified entries will have
a run window of 8 hours.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
One method to resolve this problem is to create a brand new PROCESS.GLB
file by installing a version 3.2 postoffice in a temporary location on a
local hard disk drive. First, make a backup copy of the existing
PROCESS.GLB file on the production postoffice and then copy this newly
created PROCESS.GLB file to the working postoffice. Run version 3.2 of the
ADMIN.EXE program and re-create the entries. This will set the run window
to 8 hours for all of the entries.
<P>
Another method to resolve this problem is to create a brand new PROCESS.GLB
file as described above and then use the DSSCHED.EXE utility included with
Application Note WA0725, "Directory Synchronization (Dir-Sync)" (text dated
8/94) to import a text file containing the schedule times. The following is
a sample text file:

</PRE><h3>Notes</h3>
 

<UL><LI>The T1, T2, and T3 times are described in Application Note WA0725.

<LI>DSSCHED.EXE will ignore the T2 times on a newly created PROCESS.GLB file
   because, by default, the postoffice installed to the temporary location
   is a requestor postoffice. To include T2, run the ADMIN.EXE program
   against this postoffice and make it a Dir-Sync server. A Dir-Sync server
   PROCESS.GLB file (including the T2 times) should not be used on a
   requestor postoffice.

<LI>If all the requestor postoffices use the same Dir-Sync times and if
   there are no time-zone issues, the administrator can create one
   requestor PROCESS.GLB file and copy it to each requestor postoffice.
