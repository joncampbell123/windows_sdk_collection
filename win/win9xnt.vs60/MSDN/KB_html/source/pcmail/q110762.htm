The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail Serializer Utility, version 3.2
</UL> 
<P>
Version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail Serializer utility is only available from
the Microsoft Select CD. The following is the text of the README.TXT file
included with the Serializer utility.
<P>
README
<P><h3>Microsoft Mail Version 3.2 Serializer Utility</h3>
 
<P>
This README describes the Microsoft Mail version 3.2 Serializer utility and
how you use it. This entire file must be read prior to using the
Serializer.
<P>
<P><h3>Installation Notes</h3>
 
<P>
The Serializer should NOT be installed to ANY network drive or path.
Installation is supported only on local drives on the machine in which the
Serializer diskette is placed and run from. Attempting to install the
Serializer to a network drive or path will result in incorrect Serializer
operation and loss of serial number range.
<P>
The Serializer should not be installed on a RAM drive or virtual drive.
<P>
<P><h3>What is the Serializer?</h3>
 
<P>
The Serializer utility allows you to create unique Microsoft Mail version
3.2 Setup disks from the disks created by the Select CD process.
Serialization ensures that each postoffice has a unique serial number,
which is required for proper operation of Microsoft. Each Serializer
contains a unique set of serial numbers that it uses to validate the disks
you create. Each serial number in the set is used only once. When all
serial numbers have been used, the Serializer expires.
<P>
<P><h3>When Should You Use the Serializer?</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft Mail version 3.2 Setup disks created from Select CDs dated August
1993 and later will not install without prior serialization. Only copies of
Server Disk 1 (the Mail Setup disk) require serialization; no other
Microsoft Mail disks require serialization.
<P>
<P><h3>Supplied Files</h3>
 
<P>
SERIAL.EXE is the MS-DOS based Serializer program that allows creation of
unique Mail Setup disks. It is the only file supplied.
<P>
<P><h3>Using the Serializer</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Before you use the Serializer, first create the Mail Setup disk(s) you
   will need by copying the Server Disk 1 files from the Select CD to a
   floppy disk using the Select CD disk creation utility, SELECT.EXE.

<P><LI>Run SERIAL.EXE.
<P>
   SERIAL.EXE displays three options:
<P>
<P><PRE>    *  Serialize Setup Diskette
    *  View Next Serial Number to Be Used
    *  Install/Uninstall Serializer to Another Location
</PRE><P>
   The three options are described in the following section.
<P>
   Serialize Setup Diskette prompts you for the drive that contains the
   Mail Setup disk to be serialized, and then serializes the disk. If the
   disk has already been serialized, you have the option to reserialize the
   disk with a new serial number.
<P>
   View Next Serial Number to Be Used displays the next unique serial
   number that will be used by the Serializer the next time a serialization
   is performed. It also displays the last serial number available in the
   set.
<P>
   Install/Uninstall Serializer to Another Location allows you to move the
   Serializer to a specified location. With this option, the Serializer
   will copy itself to the specified location and delete the old copy. The
   first time you run the Serializer, you must run it from the floppy disk.
   The only option available will be to move the Serializer to another
   location. Once this is done, the Serializer may be run from the new
   location and all options will be available.
<P>
   * See Installation Notes above.

<P><LI>To exit the Serializer utility, from the main menu, press the ESC key.
<P>
</OL><h3>Maintaining a Unique Copy of the Serializer</h3>
 
<P>
 
CAUTION: If the Serializer is copied or modified by any means other than
the menu option described in the preceding section, Microsoft cannot ensure
that the serial numbers are unique. This includes copies for backup
purposes. To assist in maintaining uniqueness, the Serializer will run only
from the directory in which it is installed, and copied versions will not
run from different directories.
 
<P>
Each Serializer is unique, since the set of serial numbers it contains is
unique. You must make sure that there is only one valid copy of the
Serializer and that this copy is not accidentally deleted. After the
Serializer has used each of its serial numbers, it will expire and will no
longer be able to run. At that time, you can delete the Serializer.
<P>
<P><h3>Backing up the Serializer and Mail Setup Disk</h3>
 
<P>
You should install the single valid copy of the Serializer on a secure
drive that is backed up daily to ensure ease of recovery in the event of
hardware failure and subsequent data loss.
<P>
You should store each serialized Mail Setup disk in a secure location with
a clearly marked serial number to ensure ease of recovery from hardware
failure.
