The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail Gateway to IBM PROFS and OfficeVision, version 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
When troubleshooting problems with the LAN side of the Microsoft
Gateway to IBM PROFS, Microsoft Product Support Services (PSS) needs
as much information as possible about the problem and your site's
gateway configuration:

<UL><LI>Please supply the versions of both the Gateway and Host Access code,
   and possibly the release of the postoffice that is installed on the
   local-area network (LAN). Also, we may need to know the type of 3270
   emulation program the gateway PC is using.

<LI>Please describe the problem as accurately and as definitively as
   possible. For example, rather than stating that "the gateway is
   down," use a more accurate description, such as "LAN mail is not
   getting uploaded to the host, and the resulting files are being
   copied into the VMGATE\ERR subdirectory."

<LI>If describing the problem is difficult, the best single source of
   problem information is usually the VMGATE.LOG file in the LOG
   subdirectory of the mail system database. Use the -V -Q -L options to
   generate a very detailed log of gateway activity, which will
   hopefully indicate the reason why the problem is occurring.
<P>
</UL>For a first contact form you can use to collect needed information, query
