The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail Gateway to Fax, versions 2.1b and 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
The Microsoft Mail Gateway to Fax may experience "Connection Error"
problems when it is used with the Intel SatisFAXtion/200 fax board.
<P>
Intel Corporation has created a new driver for its SatisFAXtion/200
board, called DOWNLOAD.200. To install this driver, copy it to the
root directory of the boot disk.
<P>
The driver corrects problems if you use the SatisFAXtion software, even
if you do not use the Microsoft Mail Gateway to Fax. The README.TXT file,
also available from Intel, lists the problems that it resolves.
<P>
In the United States, you can obtain the driver directly from Intel
Corporation through its FAXBack Service. To use the FAXBack Service, you
must have a Touch-Tone telephone and a SatisFAXtion board. To obtain the
driver, perform these six steps:

<OL><P><LI>Boot your computer that contains the fax board and start the
   SatisFAXtion software.

<P><LI>Use a Touch-Tone telephone to call the FAXBack service at
   (800) 525-3019.

<P><LI>Follow the voice directions for the download service. The document
   identifier is 0028. The system prompts for the telephone number to
   which the SatisFAXtion board is connected.

<P><LI>Hang up the phone and the FAXBack service downloads the driver to
   the SatisFAXtion board. (The status indicator in the SatisFAXtion
   software indicates when the download is complete.)

<P><LI>Select the Receive attachment option to read the README.TXT file.

<P><LI>Copy the new DOWNLOAD.200 file to the root directory of the boot
   disk.
<P>
</OL><h2>REFERENCES</h2>

Software User's Manual."
