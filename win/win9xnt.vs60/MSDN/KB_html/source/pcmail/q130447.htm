The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail Gateway to Fax, version 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The following message occurs repeatedly on the gateway screen and is
repeatedly written to the FAXGATE.LOG file:
<P>
<PRE>   Failure to submit fax! Receiver &lt;phone #&gt;

</PRE>The message is not returned to the user as undeliverable. The header for
the message remains in the fax queue until it is deleted or returned
through the ADMIN.EXE program.
<P>
This message is related to a specific fax mail item. Other fax messages can
continue to be sent through the gateway.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This situation can occur when a fax mail item has an attachment that the
CAS driver rejects during submission. The program does not count this as a
retry attempt and the attempted submission continues on every faxout cycle.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 3.0.1 of Microsoft
Mail Gateway to Fax. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Mail Gateway to Fax "Administrator's Guide" explains this
error in Appendix A on page 105, as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   ... you need to use the Administrator Queue option to return or delete
   the fax items.

</PRE>Just returning or deleting the item from the queue is not enough to stop
the message. Even after returning the message from the queue, the error
message will continue. To stop the message, you must stop and restart the
gateway. To avoid lockups of the gateway, stop the gateway before it
returns Fax gateway items from the queue. After the failing item is
returned or deleted, restart the gateway.
