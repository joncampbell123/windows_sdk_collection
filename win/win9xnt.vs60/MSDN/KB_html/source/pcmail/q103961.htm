The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Electronic Forms Designer, version 1.0, running with
   Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.0 or 3.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you are reading a form created using the Routing Form included with
version 1.0 of Microsoft Electronic Forms Designer, the icon for the
enclosed file may not be displayed. This problem can occur if the file
enclosed is an executable file or if it is a document that does not have a
file association.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Routing Form does not send the icon with the form. The Routing Form
obtains the icon by extracting it from the executable file associated with
the enclosed document. (Associations for files are defined in the Windows
File Manager program.)
<P>
The icon is handled this way because the associated application may change
from recipient to recipient. For example, one user may have .TXT files
associated with Microsoft Word for Windows, another user may associate
those files with Notepad, and still another user may associate those files
with Write.
<P>
Therefore, the icon may not be displayed if there is no associated
executable file from which to extract the icon or if the enclosed file is
an executable file.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To create an association for a file, perform the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Open File Manager.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Associate.

<P><LI>Type the extension in the Files With Extension box.

<P><LI>In the Associate With box, select the application you want to
   associate with the extension. (You can choose the Browse button to
   select a program.)

<P><LI>Choose the OK button.
<P></OL>
