The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 2.1, 3.0, and 3.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you try to run the CONVERT.EXE program as described on page 17 of the
version 3.2 Microsoft Mail for PC Networks "User's Guide" for Windows and
Presentation Manager, you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   The folder conversion process was halted by an error while copying.
   No folders or messages were converted.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This error occurs when some or all of your folders are stored on the local
hard disk drive rather than on the postoffice. The Convert program is
designed to look for a user's folders on the postoffice and will not check
any local drives or directories.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
The Mail administrator can move the folders back onto the postoffice by
logging in to Mail with the MS-DOS client, selecting Options, Folders,
Private-Storage, and then selecting S for Server.
<P>
You can then run Convert again; it will perform the conversion
successfully.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Folder corruption can cause a similar problem. In this case, try archiving
the folders and then retrieving them. If any of the folders cannot be
archived, the Mail administrator may need to use the FIXFLD.EXE utility to
try to repair them.
<P>
FIXFLD.EXE is available to Mail administrators as part of Application Note
WA0641, "Database Maintenance Utilities."
<P>
You can obtain this Application Note by contacting Microsoft Product
Support Services.
