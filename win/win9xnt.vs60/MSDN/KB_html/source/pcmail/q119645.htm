The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail for Windows, version 3.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When the Windows client receives a message from the SMTP gateway that
contains a comma in the comment field of the address in the To: or Cc:
field, the address is delimited by the comma and a Non-Delivery report is
generated. No mail is misdirected or lost.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Windows client incorrectly uses the comma to delimit the address on the
To: or Cc: field. For example
<P>
<PRE>   To:&lt;Administrator (comment,comment)&gt;

</PRE>becomes two addresses resulting in
<P>
<PRE>   To: Admin; Comment)&gt;;

</PRE>The portion of the address following the comma is treated as a bad address
and a Non-Delivery report is generated.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
The sender should edit the address in the To: or Cc: field and exclude
commas in addresses.
<P>
The address appears correctly in the MS-DOS client until the Mail for
Windows client accesses the message. To read the message, use the MS-DOS
client.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 3.2 of Microsoft
Mail for PC Networks. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
