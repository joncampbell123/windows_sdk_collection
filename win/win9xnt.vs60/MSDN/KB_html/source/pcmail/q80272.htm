<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 2.1b, 2.1c, 2.1d, 2.1e,
   3.0, 3.2 and 3.5
</UL> 
<P>
If the -Q2z parameter is added on the External.exe command line, additional
information that is useful when troubleshooting modem problems will be
listed.
<P>
When External.exe is invoked as follows
<P>
<PRE>   external -q2z

</PRE>information that is sent or received from the modem will appear on the
screen. This can help isolate the cause of errors and attribute them to one
of the following:

<UL><LI>Flow control
<LI>Bad cabling
<LI>Bad phone lines
<LI>Slow network
<P>
</UL>The Diagnostics categories are Bad STX, Bad Type, Bad Seq, Bad CRC1, Bad
CRC2, Timeouts, and Rejects, and are described below.
<P>
<P><h3>Bad STX</h3>
 
<P>
This error diagnostic occurs if the protocol is looking for a "2" to
indicate the start of a message block. The protocol scans the input stream
until it finds a "2". Occurrences of this error diagnostic do not indicate
severe problems. For example, this problem could be caused by a bad CRC1
occurring, forcing the protocol to scan all subsequent packet data bytes
for a valid packet header that is looking for a "2", followed by the proper
packet type, sequence number, etc.
<P>
<P><h3>Bad Type</h3>
 
<P>
This error diagnostic occurs if a packet type indicator was received that
is not recognized by the protocol. The only reason that this problem can
currently occur is because a "2" is found and assumed to be the start of a
packet (STX), when it is not.
<P>
<P><h3>Bad Seq</h3>
 
<P>
This error diagnostic occurs when a packet is received out of sequence. All
packets in the protocol are assigned a sequence number and must be sent in
the proper order. If the previous packet was lost during the transmission,
then the subsequent packet will be interpreted as being out of sequence.
<P>
Bad CRC1 (Cyclic Redundancy Check)
 
<P>
This error diagnostic indicates that the packet header was corrupt and
rejected; that is, characters were lost during the transmission, which can
be caused by line noise or some other problem.
<P>
<P><h3>Bad CRC2</h3>
 
<P>
This error diagnostic is a secondary Cyclic Redundancy Check and also
indicates that the packet data was corrupt and rejected.
<P>
<P><h3>Timeouts</h3>
 
<P>
This error diagnostic occurs when a packet was sent and an acknowledgment
was not received within the allotted time. The default allotted time is 60
seconds; this default can be set by using the -Exxx parameter on the
External or Remote command line.
<P>
This error diagnostic occurs when slow response is encountered on the
receiving end or if the other end is dead. This problem can also occur when
using error-correcting modems (Microcom Networking Protocol [MNP]) and the
modems are taking an unusual amount of time to send valid data between each
other. This is not a severe problem, but it can cause External to abort the
communication link if many Timeouts occur.
<P>
<P><h3>Rejects</h3>
 
<P>
All of the above error diagnostics will occur only on the receiving end of
the communications link. Whenever an error is detected on the receiving
end, the protocol sends a reject packet to the sender. The sender then
keeps track of the number of reject packets received. The reject count is
an indication of the number of failures (CRCs, etc.) encountered by the
receiver.
<P>
<P><h3>Summary of Diagnostics</h3>
 
<P>
In any session that has errors, the receiver will get a combination of Bad
STXs, Bad Types, Bad Seqs, Bad CRCs, and so on, but no Rejects. The sender
will get Rejects but none of the other diagnostics. In twoway
communication sessions, the diagnostic counts are cumulative.
<P>
Clients generally assume that when they have error-correcting modems (that
is, Microcom Networking Protocol [MNP] modems) they should not get any
detected errors. MNP modems do not detect errors that occur between the
serial port and the modem; they only detect errors that occur between
modems.
<P>
The communication errors that are detected by our protocol occur between
serial ports and our External/Remote programs recover from them.
