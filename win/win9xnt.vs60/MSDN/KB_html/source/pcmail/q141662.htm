<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail Gateway to Fax, version 3.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you have insufficient rights on a Novell network environment or if the
CAS driver rejected a fax with an attachment, you may get the following
error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Failure to submit fax

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The above error may be caused by the following situations:

<UL><LI>In a Novell network environment, a new installation of the
   Microsoft Gateway to Fax may not work successfully. This problem
   may be caused by insufficient access rights.

<LI>If the Fax Gateway has been working, you can still get the above
   error message on the gateway screen and in the FAXGATE.LOG file. This
   may be related to specific faxed item(s) (with attachments rejected
   by the CAS driver during submission).
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
In a Novell network environment:

<OL><P><LI>Add the user FAXGTW to a user group granted the proper access rights.
   This group should have the RWCEM and F rights.

<P><LI>Give the FAXGTW individual account the RWCEM and F rights.
<P>
</OL>If you are not on a Novell network environment, please see the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../pcmail/q130447.htm">Q130447</A></B>
   TITLE     : FAX: Err Msg: "Failure to Submit Fax!" on Every Faxout
               Cycle

</PRE></OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If you get the above error message with a new installation, and the access
rights mentioned above are correct, then de-install and reinstall all the
Fax Gateway components. Make sure you delete and remove any previous
occurrence of the Intel SatisFAXtion files and any path referring to them.
There should be only one occurrence of those files.
<P>
Once you have installed the Intel SatisFAXtion software, you cannot move or
copy files to another location. The installation location is coded into the
.EXE file and can only be changed by reinstalling.
