<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
After you install a Digiboard card and driver on a Microsoft Mail
Multitasking MTA (MMTA) workstation, the driver may report one or more
errors while trying to load from the CONFIG.SYS into memory.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following is a list of Digiboard driver error messages, along with
a description and/or the most likely cause to the error:
<P>
<PRE>   Could not find BIOS file
   Could not find FEP file
   Could not find data file

</PRE>One or more files were missing from the digipath directory. The default
digipath directory is C:\DIGI. If the driver and data files were in a
different directory, that directory must be specified in the Digiboard
driver command line with the /F:DIGIPATH parameter.
<P>
<PRE>   IO Port Not Responding
   I/O port address set incorrectly, or conflicting with some other
   device

</PRE>The I/O port address does not match the dip switch settings, or the I/O
address is already in use by another device. Verify the I/O setting, or try
a different I/O address.
<P>
<PRE>   DigiBoard BIOS will not boot
   DigiBoard BIOS will not respond
   DigiCHANNEL board will not respond to commands from the driver

</PRE>The above errors are typically due to a memory conflict, or a memory cache
conflict. Try a different memory address setting and/or disable the memory
cache.
<P>
<PRE>   Driver Failed to Hook Timer
   System Cannot Allocate Memory

</PRE>A system call to OS/2 has failed. The most likely cause is an
incompatibility between the Digiboard driver and the OS/2 version.
<P>
<PRE>   Invalid Command Line Arguments
   Syntax error in the command line in CONFIG.SYS.

</PRE>The DEVICE= line for the Digiboard driver contains invalid information.
Double check the Digiboard driver command-line entry for syntax errors.
<P>
For more information on the Digiboard driver, see the documentation
accompanying the Digiboard installation software, such as the INSTALL.DOC
on the installation diskette or the Digiboard manuals.
