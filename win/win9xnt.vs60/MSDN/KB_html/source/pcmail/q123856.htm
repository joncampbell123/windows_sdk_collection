The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.2, 3.2a, and 3.5
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
No File Format Application Programming Interface (FFAPI) Microsoft gateway
product (MHS, SMTP, X.400, or others) for Microsoft Mail for PC Networks
can be a requester for directory synchronization (Dir-Sync). Therefore,
these gateway addresses are not automatically distributed to downstream
postoffices during the Dir-Sync process. To include gateway addresses in
Dir-Sync, the gateway addresses, in an import-format text file, must be
manually inserted into the Dir-Sync process using the Microsoft Mail for PC
Networks IMPORT.EXE utility.
<P>
A Mail administrator can get the import-format text file by either
extracting the addresses from an existing Microsoft Mail for PC Networks
gateway postoffice (using IMPORT.EXE), creating it manually, or obtaining
it from a gateway host administrator. Refer to Appendix A of the Microsoft
Mail for PC Networks "Administrator's Guide" for more information about the
format of the import-format text file.
<P>
NOTE: If you are including SMTP, X400, or MHS addresses in groups, you
should NOT use Dir-Sync to distribute these addresses.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The REBUILD.EXE utility creates the Global Address List (GAL) on each
individual postoffice from all the separate address lists on that
postoffice. Therefore, if a gateway address list exists at a specific
postoffice, these addresses will be included in the GAL. Most FFAPI-based
gateways, the SNADS gateway, and the PROFS gateway store their address
lists in a hexadecimal identifier (hex-id) .XTN file (&lt;hex-id&gt;.XTN). Other
gateways, such as the SMTP, X.400, and MHS gateways, store their address
lists in .NME and .GLB files. For example, the X.400 gateway uses X400.NME
and X400.GLB.
<P>
On any postoffice, these gateway address lists will most likely be created
by one of two methods:

<OL><P><LI>The administrator will run the IMPORT.EXE utility against an
   import-format text file, thereby populating the .USR or .NME/.GLB
   files with user address information.

<P><LI>The administrator can run the Microsoft Mail Administrator program
   (ADMIN.EXE) and manually enter the addresses under the Gateway,
   List menu item.
<P>
</OL>Either method will create an address list that REBUILD.EXE will incorporate
into the local GAL at that postoffice. Unfortunately, these addresses are
not automatically added into the Dir-Sync process.
<P>
To automatically include gateway addresses in Dir-Sync, the administrator
must first have an import-format text file. This file can be generated by
one of two methods:

<OL><P><LI>If the gateway addresses already exist on one of the postoffices,
   the administrator can extract these addresses into an import-format
   text file by using the IMPORT.EXE utility with the -X option.
<P>
   NOTE: These addresses may have been added by the administrator with
   the ADMIN.EXE program (by selecting Gateway, List).
<P>
   The IMPORT.EXE command line for this extraction process is (this
   command line has been wrapped for readability; you should type the
   entire command on one line):
<P>
<P><PRE>      import admin -p&lt;password&gt; -x -g&lt;address_type&gt; -f&lt;ex_file&gt;.txt
      -d&lt;drive&gt;
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;ex_file&gt;.TXT is the extracted import-format text file
   (IMPORT.EXE will automatically create such a file with the proper
   format) and &lt;address_type&gt; is, for example, SMTP, SNADS, or X400,
   as outlined in Appendix A of the "Administrator's Guide."

<P><LI>If the gateway addresses do not already exist on one of the postoffices,
   use a standard text editor to create this import-format text file, as
   outlined in Appendix A of the "Administrator's Guide" under the "IMPORT
   Utility" description.
<P>
   After the gateway software (gateway &amp; access component) are installed
   and configured on the gateway postoffice and gateway access
   components are installed on downstream postoffices, create or
   acquire the import-format text file that contains your gateway
   addresses. (See Appendix A under the IMPORT.EXE utility of the Microsoft
   Mail for PC Networks Administrator's Guide for additional information
   on the format of this import-format text file.) Import these addresses
   for Dir-Sync on any postoffice (usually the gateway postoffice) that
   has the gateway access component installed by typing:
<P>
<P><PRE>      import admin -p&lt;password&gt; -e -f&lt;ex_file.txt&gt; -d&lt;drive&gt;
</PRE><P>
   Where EX_FILE.TXT is the import-format text file created either by the
   extraction process listed in Step 1 above or by a text editor.
<P>
   The use of the IMPORT.EXE utility with the -E option will populate the
   REQTRANS.GLB on the postoffice with all of the gateway addresses listed
   in the import-format text file. The Dir-Sync server must have the
   gateway access component installed for these addresses to be accepted
   and propagated.
<P>
   NOTE: The administrator must install the gateway access component on
   each postoffice that will receive gateway address updates during
   Dir-Sync.
