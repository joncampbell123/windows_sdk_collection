The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail Gateway to MHS, version  3.0
<LI>Microsoft Mail Gateway to MHS Access, version  3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Mail Gateway to MHS or Microsoft Mail Gateway to MHS Access
installation program may report the following error:
<P>
<PRE>   Error getting memory. Not enough RAM to create postoffice list

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
There is not enough memory to install the addressing component of the
MHS gateway when more than 430 postoffice definitions exist on the
local postoffice.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
A possible workaround is to delete several postoffice definitions
from the local postoffice before you install the access component.
These postoffices can then be redefined after the access component is
successfully installed. Deleting postoffices affects users in two
ways:

<UL><LI>Removing a postoffice definition also removes the address list for
   that postoffice. The address list can be imported again after the
   postoffice is reinstalled.

<LI>Because the postoffice address list (POL) is removed, any entries
   in a personal address list (PAL) referring to a user on a deleted
   postoffice will no longer work. These entries will also have to be
   deleted and re-created after the new postoffice address list is
   re-created.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 3.0 of the
Microsoft Mail Gateway to MHS and Microsoft Mail Gateway to MHS Access.
This problem is corrected in INSTALL.EXE version 3.0.1.

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
After you specify the name of the network for the postoffice on which you
are installing, the installation program builds a DLLIST of all known
postoffices on that network. After the list is compiled, you are prompted
for the name of the postoffice on which you want to install. The
installation program then takes your user name and scans for it in the
postoffice list stored in memory. This is how the installation program
verifies it has a valid postoffice.
<P>
The problem is that each postoffice structure in the DLLIST takes 106
bytes; in addition, the DLL item itself is another 6 bytes. Therefore, the
total size is 112 bytes.
