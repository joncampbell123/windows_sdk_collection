The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0b and 3.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes a method for versions 3.0b and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail
for Windows that does the following:

<UL><LI>Allows individual users to share their own Personal Address Books
   (PABs), along with any custom groups or addresses they may have set up,
   with other users on their postoffice.

<LI>Allows administrators to set up one or more Mail message files (MMFs) to
   be used as templates for setting up or replacing users' PABs with ones
   containing custom groups and/or addresses that the administrator does
   not want available to everyone on the postoffice.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Whenever you run the File Export Folder command from the Windows client, a
copy of your current PAB is written to the MMF being created or updated
(even if you export zero messages). Therefore, if you know a user's
password and the full path and filename of his or her .MMF file, you can
replace that user's PAB with the one from the .MMF file you have loaded.
<P>
WARNING: The user's old PAB is REPLACED with the new PAB. The old PAB is
lost, along with all information it contained.
<P>
NOTE: When you run the File Import Folder command, only the messages you
select are transferred; your current PAB is left unchanged.
<P>
<P><h3>To replace a user's PAB</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start the Windows client, using the MMF from which you want to copy the
   PAB.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Export Folder.

<P><LI>Provide the full drive, path name, filename, and extension to the MMF
   file you want to update. Choose the OK button.
<P>
   NOTE: If neither you nor the user know his or her .MMF filename and
   location, the user can temporarily move his or her .MMF file by
   performing the following steps:
<P>
   a. From the Mail menu, choose Options.
<P>
   b. Choose the Server button.
<P>
   c. Choose Local, then provide a drive, path name, and filename (with
<P><PRE>      .MMF extension) that is in a location where both of you have access.
</PRE><P>
   When you finish updating the PAB, you should move the MMF back to its
   previous location by repeating steps a and b above, then selecting
   Postoffice (instead of Local).

<P><LI>If you are prompted for one, enter the password for the .MMF file you
   want to update.
<P>
   Make sure the Selected Folders option is selected in the Export Folders
   list box that appears.

<P><LI>Select a folder with zero (0) messages in it (an empty Wastebasket is a
   good choice).
<P>
   NOTE: If you select a folder that does not exist in the destination .MMF
   file, that folder will be created.

<P><LI>Choose Copy. A Duplicate Folder Name message box will appear.

<P><LI>Choose OK.

<P><LI>You should briefly see a box that says Copying. When that box
   disappears, choose the Close button in the Export Folders list box. The
   PAB in the other .MMF file should now be updated.
<P>
</OL><h3>To set up template MMFs</h3>
 
<P>
Administrators can set up one or more .MMF files to be used as templates
for setting up or replacing users' PABs with ones containing custom groups
and/or addresses that the administrator does not want available to everyone
on the postoffice.
<P>
To set up templates, provide a new filename in step 3 above for your
template file. Then, when you want to replace a user's PAB with the one for
which you created the template, load the template MMF by doing one of the
following:

<UL><LI>Double-click the filename in Windows File Manager. For this method to
   work, the [Extensions] section of your WIN.INI file must contain the
   following line:
<P>
<P><PRE>      mmf=c:\msmail\msmail.exe /f ^.mmf
</PRE><P>
   -or-

<LI>Use the /F parameter on the command line when you run MSMAIL.EXE.
   Versions 3.0b and later of Mail for Windows support a command-line
   option that allows you to specify a particular MMF to use when you start
   Mail in forced off-line mode. The following is a command-line example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      c:\msmail\msmail.exe /fg:\msmail\template\salesgrp.mmf
</PRE><P>
</UL>NOTE: Any template MMF will only have addresses as current as when the MMF
was created (or last updated). If there are extensive changes on your
postoffice, you may not want to use this method.
