The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, Macintosh workstation, version 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
The following is a list of features new in version 3.0 of the Microsoft
Mail for PC Networks Macintosh client.
<P>
NOTE: The Macintosh client relies on the server and/or MS-DOS client to
install template files. For example, to install a French Macintosh client
on an English postoffice, the French MS-DOS client must be installed first.
<P>
<P><h3>Global Address List</h3>
 
<P>
The word "Global" appears as the first entry in the left-hand list of lists
in the addressing dialog box when this dialog box appears for addressing
mail or copying users to the personal address list (PAL). Double-clicking
the Global entry causes the Global Address List (GAL) to appear in the left-
hand list. GAL addresses can be selected for addressing mail. Only non-
group addresses can be selected for moving to the Personal Address List
(PAL). The client issues an error message if you attempt to move a group
entry.
<P>
In the Preferences dialog box, the pop-up menu for Default Address List
contains the word "Global" as the first entry. Selecting this entry will
make the GAL the default address list that appears whenever the addressing
dialog is invoked.
<P>
<P><h3>Orphaned Personal Address List (PAL) Entry Behavior</h3>
 
<P>
If an invalid address is found in the PAL while trying to transmit mail,
the message "Invalid address for USER. Resume editing?" is displayed.
Regardless of whether you select OK or Cancel, this first message is
followed by the message, "Delete the alias for USER from your Personal
Address List?" If you select OK, the alias is removed from your PAL.
<P>
<P><h3>System 7 Features</h3>
 
<P>
Under System 7, the following features are available:

<UL><LI>Full international support
<P>
   For complete support of extended characters found in code page 850,
   you must use System 7 because the System 6 system font is missing
   some of the necessary glyphs.

<LI>Core Apple events
<P>
   The application processes open application, open document, print,
   and quit Apple events. The print event can only be used on a file
   of type TEXT saved by the application. Folders cannot be printed
   this way and no logon will occur. The application quits immediately
   after printing.

<LI>File alias resolution
<P>
   Aliases are resolved to the file or folder it refers to in the
   attachment dialog.

<LI>TrueType fonts
<P>
   The application uses TrueType fonts for all user interface text
   display.
<P>
</UL><h3>Editing of Forwarded Attachment List</h3>
 
<P>
All attachments are still forwarded when you forward a message with
attachments, but now you can remove any of the attachments from the
attachments dialog box in the same way other attachments are removed.
However, the attachments cannot be added once they are removed. A
document icon is now associated with new attachments because the
format option only applies to newly added attachments.
<P>
<P><h3>Large Message Viewing</h3>
 
<P>
You can read messages that are larger than 10 MB. The maximum size is
limited by other factors such as the amount of memory allocated to the
application.
<P>
<P><h3>Multiple Compose Windows</h3>
 
<P>
You can now open any number of Compose windows. The first one is
titled "Compose - 1." The number is sequential and is increased for
each new Compose window as long as any Compose windows remain. When
there are no more Compose windows, the number is reset to 1 (one).
Each Compose window is opened in a tiled position.
<P>
<P><h3>Transmit Speed Increased</h3>
 
<P>
The time to transmit a message has been decreased by a factor of about
14.
<P>
<P><h3>Keyboard Focus Feedback</h3>
 
<P>
Standard System 7 visual feedback that indicates which list has the
keyboard focus has been added to the Addressing and New Personal Group
dialogs. The TAB key is used to change the focus.
<P>
<P><h3>Scroll Thumb Position Maintenance</h3>
 
<P>
The scroll thumb position is now maintained in folder windows after
messages are deleted, moved, logged, saved, or copied to a folder.
Previously, the thumb was reset to the top.
<P>
<P><h3>Abort of Long Operations</h3>
 
<P>
The feedback dialog boxes for long operations now have a Stop button.
These operations include: Copy, Move, Delete, Attachment Save,
Compress, and Resort. The original state is not recovered. The Send
operation can be aborted before the message starts getting delivered
to individual recipients (as indicated by the recipient's name being
displayed in the progress dialog).
<P>
<P><h3>Undo</h3>
 
<P>
A single level undo operation is now available in Compose windows.
<P>
<P><h3>Enforcement of 78-Character Lines</h3>
 
<P>
When you compose a message, you can insert a maximum of 78 characters
on each line before word wrapping occurs.
<P>
The rules for enforcing this limit are:

<UL><LI>The words at the end of the growing sentence get wrapped to the
   next line. Call this the "overflow".

<LI>If the next line is a blank line, a new line is inserted before the
   next line for the overflow to go on. This preserves the blank line.

<LI>If the overflow can fit on the next line without causing another
   wrap, it is inserted at the beginning of that line.

<LI>If the overflow cannot fit on the next line without causing the
   next line to also wrap, a new line is inserted before the next line
   for the overflow to go on.
<P>
</UL><h3>Viewing a Macbinary Data Fork</h3>
 
<P>
To avoid displaying garbled characters, when you view a Macbinary
file, only the data fork is shown.
<P>
<P><h3>First Logon Becomes Default</h3>
 
<P>
After the first successful logon by a new user, the application uses
the entered user information as the default for subsequent logon
attempts.
<P>
<P><h3>Prints Wide Messages</h3>
 
<P>
You can print messages that are wider than the paper in the printer.
The area that was previously truncated is now printed on the next
sheet. To read the message, place the second piece of paper to the
right of the first piece.
<P>
<P><h3>Nonprintable Characters Filtered Out</h3>
 
<P>
Nonprintable characters can no longer be entered in dialog edit boxes.
<P>
<P><h3>Notification on Startup</h3>
 
<P>
The notifier can now detect new mail on startup rather than just new
mail that arrives after startup.
