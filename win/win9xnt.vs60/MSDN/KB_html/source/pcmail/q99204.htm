The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.2 and 3.5
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
On page 25 of versions 3.2 and 3.5 of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks
"Administrator's Guide," under the section heading "Setting File Attributes
for High-Traffic Networks," the following incorrect statement appears:
<P>
<PRE>   ...we recommend that you take the time to add a shareable attribute
   to all .KEY files and to .GLB files that are Read/Write.

</PRE>NOTE: The section, "Setting File Attributes for High-Traffic Networks," has
been removed in later versions of the Microsoft Mail for PC Networks
version 3.2 "Administrator's Guide" (printed after October 1993).
<P>
Please refer to page 439 of the version 3.2 and page 443 of the version 3.5
Microsoft Mail for PC Networks "Administrator's Guide" for the correct
information for setting file attributes.
<P>
If Shareable attributes are set to the CONTROL.GLB file, message corruption
is possible. The CONTROL.GLB file contains two long integers, which are
used for generating new and unique filenames. One integer is for generating
names and the other is for mail and attachment filenames.
<P>
Corruption is possible if two processes try to create messages at exactly
the same time. These processes can be anything that creates mail, such as
the Mail clients, Admin program, Gateways, and External and Dir-Sync
processes. Although this is unlikely, it is possible two processes grab the
CONTROL.GLB and allocate the same .MAI file name.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If the same .MAI file name is allocated, External will display the
following errors:
