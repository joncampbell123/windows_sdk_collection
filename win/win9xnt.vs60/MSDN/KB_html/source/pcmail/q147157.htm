The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.2, 3.2a, and 3.5
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the Mail for PC Networks Message Transfer Agent (MTA), you may
get the following error on the screen in the upper right hand corner:
<P>
<PRE>   Logging to: Error writing to log file.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The above error is caused because the MTA can not access or create the
specified log file.
<P>
The above error can be caused by the following:

<UL><LI>The system does not have proper access to the file that is indicated
   as the log file. If this is the case, you will see additional errors
   in the logging area of the screen:
<P>
<P><PRE>      [15:02] - Unable to access x:\logfilename. Check the access rights.
      [15:02] - Error on log file open.
</PRE>
<LI>The log file is held open by another process. If this is the case, you
   will see additional errors in the logging area of the screen:
<P>
<P><PRE>      [15:03] - Error on log file open.
</PRE>
<LI>You try to specify a path to a log file, but do not give a log
   filename, and a directory exists with the same name as the directory
   you specified. In addition, you will see the following errors in the
   logging area of the screen:
<P>
<P><PRE>      [15:02] - Unable to access x:\logfilename.  Check the access rights.
      [15:02] - Error on log file open.
</PRE>
<LI>You are running the Microsoft Mail Multitasking MTA for Windows NT
   (NT MMTA) as an application or as a service, and have used any of the
   following names for the log file:
<P>
<P><PRE>      AUX
      CON
      COM1, COM2, COM3, COM4
      PRN
      LPT1, LPT2, LPT3, LPT4
</PRE><P>
   The above names are reserved words and cannot be used as filenames.

<LI>You run the MS-DOS MTA (EXTERNAL.EXE) and use COM1, COM2, COM3,
   COM4, or AUX for the log in the logging area of the screen. You will
   also see the following errors:
<P>
<P><PRE>      [15:10] - A critical error has occurred
      [15:10] - Data:  Error Code=bf21, Device Error =000a
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: In the upper right hand corner of the screen, the Logging to:
   line will not display an error, but the log will not be created.
<P>
   If you use LPT1, LPT2, LPT3, or LPT4, the MTA will run, and the
   Logging to: line will not display an error, and the log will not
   be created.
<P>
   If you use CON for the filename, you will see distortion on the
   screen, and the log will not be created.

<LI>If the directory permissions on an NTFS partition are too restrictive,
   even though the Share permissions have been configured as Full
   Control to Everyone, this error condition will occur. Microsoft
   Windows NT always uses the most restrictive set of permissions when
   it accesses files/directories across the network.
