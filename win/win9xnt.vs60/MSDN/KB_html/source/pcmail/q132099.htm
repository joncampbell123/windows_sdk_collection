The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail Multitasking MTA for Windows NT, version 3.5
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Windows NT System account cannot be used as the service
account with the Microsoft Mail Multitasking MTA for Windows NT (NT MMTA).
<P>
The LocalSystem account is the account used by the operating system; it has
a security identifier (SID) that contains all zeroes. By default, this
account has almost complete control of the local computer, but no rights in
the network.
<P>
Because this user account has no rights to access the network, the
following error will occur when you start the service:
<P>
<PRE>   Could not start the MS Mail External - (Instance Name) service on
   \\Computer Name

   Error 2140: An internal Windows NT error occurred.

</PRE>This error can also occur when the universal naming convention (UNC) is not
valid in the Home PO Path (UNC): field.
<P>
When the service is started the NT MMTA allows Win32 to validate the UNC;
however, the NT MMTAs Service Type is what validates that the path
specified is actually a valid PO.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To workaround this problem, create a Windows NT user and assign the Log On
as Service right.
<P>
To assign the service account the right to log on as a Windows NT service,
follow the steps below:

<OL><P><LI>From the Administrative Tools group, run User Manager.

<P><LI>From the Policies menu, choose User Rights.

<P><LI>In the User Rights Policy dialog box, select the Show Advanced User
   Rights check box. Select Log On as a Service, and choose the Add button.
<P>
   If Log On as a Service does not appear, make sure the Show Advanced
   User Rights check box is selected.

<P><LI>In the Add Users and Groups dialog box, select the domain name. Select
   the Show Users button. Select the user account, and select the Add
   button.
<P>
   If the newly created service account does not appear in the Names box,
   make sure the List Names From box displays the computer name of the
   local server under which the user was logged onto.

<P><LI>When the User Rights Policy dialog box displays the service account
   name in the Grant To box, select the OK button.

<P><LI>When the User Rights Policy dialog box correctly displays the service
   account with the Log On as a Service, select the OK button.
<P>
   The service account for this site is now ready to use.
<P></OL>
