<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400, version 3.0
<LI>Microsoft Mail Gateway to SMTP, version 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When a message is sent to both an X.400 user and an SMTP user, the Reply
All feature does not work.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When a message is sent to an X.400 user and an SMTP user, the X.400
recipient will not have a valid route to send mail to the SMTP recipient.
The message shows both the SMTP name and the X.400 name in the TO: header.
However, the SMTP user does not have a return address route. When the X.400
recipient chooses to Reply All, he or she can see only the original MSMail
sender, NOT the SMTP user.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
This is working the way it is supposed to work. There is no way for the
"remote" X.400 system to route mail to SMTP. Our mail program does not
allow mail coming in from one gateway to be routed out through another
gateway. The TO: field does include both recipients. Users will need to
reconstruct their own addresses to reach the SMTP user.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Be sure you do not strip out the gateway headers when you set up your
gateways. If you strip the headers, you will not know who the original
recipients were.
