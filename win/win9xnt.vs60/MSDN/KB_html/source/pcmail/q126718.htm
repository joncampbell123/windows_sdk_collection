The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.2 and 3.2a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
For the Microsoft Mail for PC Networks External (MTA) program to transfer
mail between postoffices a network drive must be connected to each
postoffice from the workstation that will be running the EXTERNAL.EXE
program. This article describes the software needed and how to set up the
operating system to have the External program process mail on both a Novell
NetWare server and Microsoft Windows NT or Microsoft LAN Manager servers.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
NetWare workstations communicate with the NetWare server using NetWare
Core Protocol (NCP) packets and Microsoft network workstations (LAN
Manager, Windows for Workgroups, and NT workstation) communicate with
Windows NT or LAN Manager servers using Server Message Blocks (SMBs). For
this reason one workstation with a single protocol and redirector cannot
connect to both types of servers, unless a workstation can be configured
for dual protocols and redirectors.
<P>
Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 or Workgroup Add-On for MS-
DOS version 3.11 provides a Microsoft Windows Network by default. Novell
NetWare can be added for dual protocol/redirector configuration. After a
proper installation, a drive letter can be assigned to a Windows NT or LAN
Manager server, and a drive letter mapped to a Novell NetWare server. The
Microsoft Mail EXTERNAL.EXE (MTA) can then use the two drive letters for
transferring and delivering mail.
<P>
NOTE: Microsoft network workstation is a native protocol/redirector for
Windows for Workgroups 3.11 and Workgroup Add-On for MS-DOS, so you
only need to add Novell NetWare to have dual connectivity.
<P>
To add Novell NetWare support for Windows for Workgroups 3.11:

<OL><P><LI>Select the Network Setup icon in the Network program manager group.

<P><LI>Choose Network, and select Other to install Windows Support for
   Additional Networks.

<P><LI>Select Novell NetWare (Workstation Shell 3.x) or Novell NetWare
   (Workstation Shell 4.x) depending on if you are using NETX.EXE
   or VLM.EXE.

<P><LI>Setup will prompt for Novell files NOT included with Windows for
   Workgroups 3.11. Novell makes these files available on its bulletin
   board service (BBS) and in the Novell CompuServe forum (GO NOVFILES).
<P>
   The current filenames are WINDR2.EXE and NWDLL2.EXE. However, it may
   change from time to time. Contact your Novell service person or the
   Novell CompuServe forum for more information on availability.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: If you use NETX.EXE, a LastDrive=P will be placed in your CONFIG.SYS.
If you use VLM.EXE, the LastDrive will equal Z.
<P>
When LastDrive is set to P: NetWare drives are Q: through Z:, but local MS-
DOS drive letters can be remapped to NetWare drives. For example, if a
Windows NT or LAN Manager server is connected using
<P>
<PRE>   NET USE M: \\Server\Share

</PRE></OL>where the Novell drive N: can then be mapped to MAP N:=SYS:MAILDATA.
EXTERNAL.EXE can now be executed with a -DMN to service these two
postoffices.
<P>
NOTE: Once installed you should not attempt to run EXTERNAL.EXE from
a MS-DOS prompt while in Windows. Instead you should boot the computer
and start the network with a NET START BASIC command. Establish (NET USE
or MAP) the postoffice drive letters, and execute EXTERNAL.EXE.
<P>
To add Novell NetWare support for Workgroup Add-On for MS-DOS 3.11:

<UL><LI>Run the SETUP program from floppy diskette while logged into your
   Novell Network.
<P>
   This will provide you the Microsoft network protocol/redirector, while
   keeping your Novell NetWare configuration.
