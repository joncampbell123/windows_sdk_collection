The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2
</UL> 
<P>
Below is a list of common questions and answers about Messaging Application
Programming Interface (MAPI) from versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2 of Microsoft
Mail for PC Networks. This information can help you understand what MAPI is
and what it can do.

<PRE> 1. Q. What are common messaging calls (CMC), Simple MAPI, and Extended
       MAPI?

    A. Simple MAPI and CMC include a set of functions for application
       developers to make applications mail-aware. Examples of mail-aware
       applications include spreadsheet programs and word processors.
       Both can also be used to build custom messaging applications.

       The difference between CMC and Simple MAPI is that CMC is a cross
       platform API. CMC is independent of the operating system and
       underlying hardware used by the messaging service. However, both
       contain similar functionality, such as sending, addressing,
       receiving, and saving messages.

       Extended MAPI provides more complex messaging capabilities. Extended
       MAPI allows applications to manage the generation and handling of
       complex messages, large numbers of received messages, message store,
       and complex addressing information. Extended MAPI application
       functionality includes data collection, work flow, message
       management, unattended message filtering, and agent-based retrieval
       applications.

       Extended MAPI is currently only accessible via C or C++. At this
       time, no Microsoft Visual Basic (VB) or Visual Basic for
       Applications interface is available.

 2. Q. What are the current support options for CMC, Simple MAPI, and
       Extended MAPI?

    A. CMC and Simple MAPI support is provided by Microsoft Product
</PRE>Support.  Because Extended MAPI is not yet released,
<PRE>       there is currently no support. However, you can obtain the MAPI
       specification from either of three sources:

        - Electronic mail: Send requests to mapi@microsoft.com; be sure to
          include your mailing address
        - FTP server.../developr/mapi

        NOTE: The MSWRKGRP forum no longer exists.

 3. Q. What do I need to create a MAPI program?

    A. A MAPI program (or client) can be created using either Microsoft C
       or Microsoft Visual Basic. Simple MAPI functions are accessed from
       MAPI.DLL, which is included with versions 3.0 and 3.2 of Microsoft
       Mail for Windows.

       The "Technical Reference Guide" and disk included with Mail for PC
       Networks provide function descriptions, as well as sample source
       code. To run your MAPI application, you need version 3.0 or later of
       Microsoft Windows, version 3.0 or later of a Mail for PC Networks
       postoffice, version 3.0 or later of Mail for Windows.

 4. Q. Is Extended MAPI functionality available now?

    A. No. However, if you are interested, you can ask to be considered for
       the MAPI 1.0 SDK beta by sending your name, phone number, fax
       number, address, and development interest by sending Internet mail
       to mapi@microsoft.com or by calling (206) 936-6956.

       NOTE: Extended MAPI is currently only available via C or C++.

 5. Q. What is a service provider?

    A. A service provider is the backend that provides true messaging-
       system independence for applications. A service provider is like a
       Windows printer driver. Just as a printer driver allows printing to
       a specific printer, a service provider allows communication to any
       messaging service such as Mail for PC Networks, MHS, and PROFS.

       Multiple providers can be available to the same mail client
       simultaneously. Address Book, Message store and Transport service
       providers can be developed with the MAPI 1.0 SDK beta.

 6. Q. Does MAPI work with the Mail Remote for Windows?

    A. MAPI works with version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows
       in the same way it works with Mail for Windows, with respect to
       functionality with the Mail Message File (MMF) and
       sending/receiving. When your application quits, Mail automatically
       tries to dial out if the Remote client is selected.

 7. Q. Can I use MAPI to create an MS-DOS application?

    A. No. MAPI can only be used to create Windows applications.

 8. Q. Does Simple MAPI work with Windows NT?

    A. Yes. NT includes a 32-bit MAPI.DLL and a 16-bit MAPI.DLL file. For
       more information on these files, please refer to article <B><A href="../pcmail/q108842.htm">Q108842</A></B> in
       the Microsoft Knowledge Base.

 9. Q. Can I do administration with MAPI?

    A. No. MAPI does not contain administrative functionality.

10. Q. What are custom commands and custom message types?

    A. Custom commands allow you to add commands to menus in Mail for
       Windows. These commands can run a program or perform a task. Custom
       message types are messages that can be specific between sender and
       recipient and can be used to perform tasks based on a mail event
       such as delivery of mail, composing a message, and reading mail.

11. Q. Where can I get more information about MAPI?

    A. You can access information on MAPI from a number of sources. The
    "Technical Reference Guide" and disk included with Microsoft Mail for
    PC Networks and version 3.1 of Microsoft Windows for Workgroups contain
    sample code and reference material.

    Another good reference for actual implementation of MAPI calls from
    various Microsoft products is available in the Workgroup templates
    software package.

    The Windows for Workgroups Resource Kit, the Microsoft Software
    Developer's Network (MSDN) CD, and Microsoft Visual Basic versions 2.0
    and 3.0 for Windows are good references for MAPI information.

    You can obtain the MAPI 1.0 specification by mailing
    mapi@microsoft.com.
