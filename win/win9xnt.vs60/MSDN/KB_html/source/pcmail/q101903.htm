<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you are using the AT&amp;T driver for Mail Remote for Windows, you might
experience what seems to be extraordinarily long time-outs upon
interruption of service from the AT&amp;T host.
<P>
To shorten this time, use a serial communication cable between your modem
and computer that supports Pin 8 for Carrier Detect, and select the Carrier
Detect option in the Communications dialog box.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
By default, the Carrier Detect option is not selected for use with the AT&amp;T
driver. This can allow common serial printer cables to be used for modem
connections, even though these cables should not be used for modem
communication.
<P>
If for any reason there is an interrupted connection, and the Carrier
Detect check box is cleared (not selected), Mail may take several minutes
to time-out.
<P>
To make the time-out faster, make sure your modem cable has a data carrier
detect pin. If it does not, and you select the Carrier Detect check box,
the modem will not connect to the AT&amp;T Mail Service.
<P>
Once your have installed a serial communication cable that provides correct
service of Pin 8 for Carrier Detection, select the Carrier Detect check
box. To do this, choose Communications from the Mail menu, then choose the
Communications button. The Communications dialog box appears with the
Carrier Detect check box.
<P>
For more information about the carrier detect option, see section F,
"Carrier Detection and Serial Cables" in section 2, "Mail Remote Driver" of
the README.TXT file installed with Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows.
