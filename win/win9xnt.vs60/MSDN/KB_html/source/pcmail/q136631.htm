The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, versions 3.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use Mail Remote for Windows and Beyond Incorporated WinRules
version 1.0, and you exit Mail without sending a composed message, the
remote modem session is initiated.
<P>
Notes:

<UL><LI>WinRules is a third-party product that can be used to filter the
   receipt notification messages into specified folders in the mail
   message file (MMF).

<LI>You will not see a dialog box notifying you of unsent mail.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When you install WinRules version 1.0, the following lines are added to the
[Custom Commands] section of the MSMAIL.INI file:
<P>
<PRE>   [Custom Commands]

   winrulesN=3.0;;;;c:\winrules\wrdriver.dll;D;0010000000000000;;;;
   winrulesS=3.0;;;;c:\winrules\wrdriver.dll;0;1000000000000000;;;;
   winrulesT=3.0;;;;c:\winrules\wrdriver.dll;1;0100000000000000;;;;

</PRE><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
If you comment out the above lines, Mail Remote will function as designed.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 3.2 of Microsoft
Mail Remote for Windows. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When a message is sent from an application that uses Simple Messaging
Application Programming Interface (MAPI), such as Microsoft Word version
2.0 for Windows and WinRules version 1.0 using the WRDRIVER.DLL driver
file, and you have Mail Remote for Windows installed but not running, the
message is always sent immediately, despite the Mail Remote for Windows
connection-scheduling feature.
<P>
When the application closes the Simple MAPI session, the spooler begins to
shut down. The spooler checks for mail in the Outbox, spools the mail to an
intermediate storage location, and begins sending the mail automatically,
without prompting for user confirmation.
<P>
The Mail Remote driver cannot control the spooler, so when the intermediate
storage location is checked for mail, an asynchronous session is started.
This is a limitation of MAPI.
<P>
For additional information on MAPI, please see the following articles in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
