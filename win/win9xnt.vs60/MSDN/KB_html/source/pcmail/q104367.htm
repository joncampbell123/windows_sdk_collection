The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, MS-DOS workstation, versions 2.1
   and 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Versions 2.1 and 3.0 of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, MS-DOS workstation,
may not appear to be receiving new mail if there are more messages in the
inbox than there are headers selected to be viewed. If there is more mail
in your mailbag (MBG) than can be displayed, you receive the following
error message:
<P>
<PRE>                 Notice 33
   More mail at postoffice than displayed.
          Press Enter to continue

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The MS-DOS client has a feature that allows you to specify the maximum
number of mail items that can be displayed in the inbox. This can restrict
you from being able to view all of the messages that are currently in the
inbox if you have more messages than are allowed to be viewed.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this problem, increase the number of headers, move mail into
private folders, or delete old mail.
<P>
You can also increase the number of headers that can be viewed in the inbox
by selecting Options, Configure, Headers.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
There is another feature that allows you to specify the sorting criteria.
To use this option, select Options, Configure, Sortkey. The default is to
sort by date in descending order. This feature can result in new mail not
being visible when the number of messages in the inbox exceeds the number
of headers that can be displayed.
<P>
The MS-DOS client will only sort the first X number of headers that are
flagged as being not deleted in the MBG file. Therefore, if there are no
deleted records in the first X records, the new mail message will be placed
further down in the MBG and will not be displayed in the inbox.
