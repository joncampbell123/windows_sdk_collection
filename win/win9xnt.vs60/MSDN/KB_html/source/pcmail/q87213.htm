<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
HUB mail enables you to send mail from one MS Mail postoffice to another,
by means of the PROFS gateway. This effectively uses your mainframe
computer as a "backbone" for mail traveling between two or more local
area networks (LANs).
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To define a HUB mail connection, select the Ext-Admin/Create function
in the Admin program. Create the new postoffice definition. Select
"Indirect" as the routing type, and enter the direct PROFS gateway
name when prompted for the network name.
<P>
The new postoffice must also be defined in the PWACSI DATA file on the
gateway VM ID's 191 "A" disk, and a REROUTE statement must be added in
the MS-RSCS configuration file. This ensures that the HUB mail travels
through one gateway to MS-RSCS, and then from MS-RSCS down through another
gateway to the destination postoffice.
<P>
There are two main advantages to using HUB mail:

<UL><LI>With HUB mail, only one item is created on the host side of the
   gateway for each message with attachments sent from the LAN. A
   message with multiple attachments is encapsulated into one item,
   and forwarded directly to the destination gateway.

<LI>The External program is not involved in the delivery of the message
   (between two direct gateways). This frees External to handle other
   tasks, such as servicing Remote Mail users.
