<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail Gateway to MHS, version 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Version 3.0 of Microsoft Mail Gateway to MHS can backbone Microsoft Mail
over MHS, which enables automatic encapsulation of messages, including
those containing OLE objects, something not normally available over MHS.
Encapsulation passes OLEs through seamlessly and works around the fact
that MHS messages are text-based.
<P>
Backboning works only between Microsoft Mail postoffices defined as
indirect through MHS and with address mapping set up. When backboning is
enabled, all users appear to be normally defined Microsoft Mail users,
even though the transport between sites is MHS.
<P>
It also has the offset advantage of allowing directory synchronization
messages to be sent through MHS, even though to MHS the recipient is
invalid.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Messages are sent from the Microsoft Mail user to the gateway in the
Microsoft Mail format. Normally, the gateway would read the header of the
message into the MHS format, it would read the body into the body of the
MHS message, and it would note any attachments. With encapsulation, the
header is read to get the sender and recipient details. The sender is
changed to $Encaps@Gateway and the recipient is changed to User1@gateway.
The Microsoft Mail message format is maintained by making the message an
attachment to the MHS message.
