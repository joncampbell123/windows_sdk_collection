<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, versions 3.0 and 3.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you are using version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, there is
no way to download only unread messages.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem is due to a limitation of EXTERNAL.EXE from versions 3.0 and
3.2 of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Suppose you are running Mail Remote for Windows at work. You want to
retrieve all the messages from the postoffice and delete them from the
mailbag ("Send All and Retrieve Unread Messages").
<P>
Yet you are also running Mail Remote for Windows at home. From home,
you want to use headers ("Send All and Retrieve Selected Messages") to
see if there is any mail, read mail at home, and when you come into
work the next day you would like that mail retrieved and stored in
your message store file (MMF). However, messages you read at home are
not retrieved to your office.
<P>
To get them, you must change the setup at work, get headers, mark
everything for retrieval, connect to Mail, and then change the setup
back to receive all messages. However, there is no way to ask
EXTERNAL.EXE for all unread messages. There also is no way to
determine whether or not a read message already exists in the inbox,
so downloading all messages would create duplicates.
