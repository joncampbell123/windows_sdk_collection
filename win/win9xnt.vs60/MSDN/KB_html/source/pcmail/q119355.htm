The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 2.1, 3.0, and 3.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Mail for PC Networks uses script files to specify a variety of
serial devices, communications (COM) ports, and baud rates. Within a script
file are script procedures that are run by Mail programs to accomplish
certain tasks.
<P>
One of these tasks is monitoring the COM port for incoming calls. This is
accomplished by running the ANSWER procedure within a script file. When
idle, the External Mail program (EXTERNAL.EXE) and the Listen program
(LISTEN.EXE) run the ANSWER procedure about once per second or a little
more than 50 times per minute. LISTEN is the MS-DOS Remote terminate-and-
stay-resident (TSR) program that is run to monitor the COM port for
incoming calls.
<P>
The ANSWER procedure looks for the number 2 coming from the COM port. The
number 2 is the numeric form of a ringing phone; RING is the text form. For
null-modem connections, the ANSWER procedure looks for the number 9 from
the COM port. Once an incoming call is detected, the ANSWER procedure
issues an ATA to answer the phone, or responds with the number 8 for the
null-modem script. At this point, the modems negotiate a rate at which to
exchange data and this information is passed to EXTERNAL.EXE or LISTEN.EXE
in the form of a numeric result code.
<P>
NOTE: In general, Microsoft Mail script files initialize modems to use
numeric result codes; however, you can also initializing modems to use
text.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Including the ANSWER procedure, a script file has five reserved
procedures/label names:

<UL><LI>INITIALIZE
<LI>CALL
<LI>ANSWER
<LI>DISCONNECT
<LI>RESET
<P>
</UL>Not all of these script procedures must appear in a script file. If a
script procedure does not exist, the Mail program does not perform the
function. For example if there is no ANSWER section, the External Mail
program does not answer the phone.
<P>
The following is more information about each section and which Mail
programs use it.
<P>
<P><h3>INITIALIZE</h3>
 
<P>
The External Mail program, Mail Remote for MS-DOS, and Mail Remote for
Windows all run this section. This section configures the serial port and
the device attached to it. It starts the communication session to ensure
the device is available and responding and is run once and only once during
a session. TRANSMIT.EXE is the MS-DOS Remote program that is used to
transmit mail to the postoffice. It is called automatically when you run
MAIL.EXE and you choose to dial the postoffice.
<P>
<P><h3>CALL</h3>
 
<P>
The External Mail program, Mail Remote for MS-DOS, and Mail Remote for
Windows all run this section. This section initializes a connection between
two devices. It is run when there is mail queued for another postoffice, an
MS-DOS Remote user, or when a Windows Remote user has mail to send. It can
also be run by the Microsoft Mail Gateway to MCI.
<P>
<P><h3>ANSWER</h3>
 
<P>
The External Mail program and Mail Remote for MS-DOS both run this section.
Note that Windows Remote does not support answering the phone for incoming
calls, hence it does not run the ANSWER section.
<P>
<P><h3>DISCONNECT</h3>
 
<P>
The External Mail program, Mail Remote for MS-DOS, and Mail Remote for
Windows all run this section. This section is run after all communications
for incoming and outgoing calls are complete.
<P>
<P><h3>RESET</h3>
 
<P>
The External Mail program, Mail Remote for MS-DOS, and Mail Remote for
Windows all run this section. This section is run after every
disconnection, after the DISCONNECT section has been run.
