<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Some symptoms of corrupted access record entries are as follows:

<OL><P><LI>A user cannot load his or her folders subdirectory.

<P><LI>A user is no longer recognizable as a remote modem mail user.

<P><LI>A user gets the error message "Error in mail header retrieval."

<P><LI>A user sees corrupted character strings in different fields that
   relate to his or her personally set environment.
<P>
</OL><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To check whether an ACCESS file is corrupt, divide the file sizes by the
following numbers:
<P>
<PRE>   ACCESS.GLB  (1172 /  586) = 2
   ACCESS2.GLB ( 138 /  69 ) = 2
   ACCESS3.GLB (1024 /  512) = 2

</PRE></OL>The file sizes must always divide evenly and the number of records per
file must always be the same for the same files. This number will not
always accurately represent the number of local users defined at the
postoffice because the concept of deleted records is being used. The
above calculations show that there are/were two users defined on the
local postoffice.
<P>
File size alone will not always guarantee that the files are not
corrupted. It is still possible for an individual's access record to
be corrupted and not reflect this in the file size.
