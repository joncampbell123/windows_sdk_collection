The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2
</UL> 
<P>
This article lists and explains all the entries in the Microsoft Mail
for Windows private profile, MSMAIL.INI, that are contained in the
[MMF] section.
<P>
<P><h2>[MMF]</h2>
 
<P>
Most entries in this section affect automatic compression of the Mail
message file. By default, message files have the extension .MMF. When
enabled, automatic compression uses idle time on your computer to
recover disk space freed by deleting messages and return that space to
the file system.
<P>
<P><h3>AutoDisconnectInterval=&lt;number of minutes&gt;</h3>
 
<P>
This entry sets the amount of system idle time before a Mail file not
stored locally is closed. Any system activity reopens a closed Mail
file automatically. Closing Mail files that are stored on the Mail
server ensures that they can be backed up when your system
administrator backs up the Mail server. If your Mail file is stored
locally, you should back it up using the Mail Backup command. If this
entry is set to 0 (zero), your Mail file is closed only when you exit
and sign out of Mail. This setting should be larger than the
Secs_Till_Fast_Compress setting to give Mail time to compress the Mail
file before it is closed.
<P>
The default value is 60 minutes of system inactivity.
<P>
<P><h3>Kb_Free_Start_Compress=&lt;number of kilobytes&gt;</h3>
 
<P>
The message store manager's background compression algorithm will kick
in when it detects at least this much recoverable space in your
message file. Both this entry and Percent_Free_Start_Compress are
always active; the first one to trigger starts compression.
<P>
The default value is 300K.
<P>
<P><h3>Kb_Free_Stop_Compress=&lt;number of kilobytes&gt;</h3>
 
<P>
The message store manager's background compression algorithm will shut
off when there is less than this much recoverable space in your
message file. This avoids extensive compression trying to recover the
last little bit of free space. Both this entry and
Percent_Free_Stop_Compress are always active; the last one to trigger
stops compression.
<P>
The default value is 100K.
<P>
<P><h3>No_Compress=&lt;0/1&gt;</h3>
 
<P>
Set this entry to 1 to entirely disable background compression of the
message store.
<P>
The default value is 0 (background compression is enabled).
<P>
<P><h3>Percent_Free_Start_Compress=&lt;number&gt;</h3>
 
<P>
Background compression will start when the amount of recoverable space
rises above this percentage of the total file size. Both this entry
and Kb_Free_Start_Compress are always active; the first one to trigger
starts compression.
<P>
The default value is 10 (ten percent).
<P>
<P><h3>Percent_Free_Stop_Compress=&lt;number&gt;</h3>
 
<P>
Background compression will stop when the amount of recoverable space
falls below this percentage of the total .MMF file size. Both this
entry and Kb_Free_Stop_Compress are always active; the last one to
trigger stops compression.
<P>
The default value is 5 (5 percent).
<P>
<P><h3>Secs_Till_Fast_Compress=&lt;number of seconds&gt;</h3>
 
<P>
The background compression algorithm has a "fast mode" and a "slow
mode." It begins in slow mode, trying to avoid impacting system
response time. After a number of seconds of system inactivity, defined
by this entry, it will switch to fast mode. Any user activity will
switch it back into slow mode.
<P>
The default value is 600 seconds (ten minutes) of system inactivity.
