The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, version 3.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The postoffice address list (POL) is not updated after a new address list
has been downloaded.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
There are three possible causes of this problem:

<UL><LI>The user is defined as having a custom directory view rather than the
   default view

<LI>The RNETWORK.GLB file is not updated properly on the postoffice

<LI>The ADMIN.NME file on the client is not updating properly
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>If Custom Views Are Being Used</h3>
 
<P>
If the user has been defined on the postoffice as using custom directory
views, the default RNETWORK.GLB file that is generated every day at
4 A.M. will not update this particular client's address book. For
changes to be reflected in a custom view, you must use the Mail
Administrator (ADMIN.EXE) program to update the custom view, as follows:

<OL><P><LI>Select Remote, Views, Modify. Select the first view and press ENTER.

<P><LI>Press ESC, then press ENTER when the Enter View Name dialog box is
   displayed.

<P><LI>Press ENTER one more time to select Yes in response to the suggestion,
   "Modify Remote Directory View."
<P>
</OL>This will update the custom view. Users will see the update after they
download the address book.
<P>
Repeat these steps for all views on the system that contain the changes.
<P>
<P><h3>If RNETWORK.GLB Is Not Updated</h3>
 
<P>
The RNETWORK.GLB file is updated from the ADMIN.NME file every day at
4 A.M. Check the RNETWORK.GLB file time and date. If the file is not dated
and stamped at 4 A.M., you can safely assume that it was not updated. If
this is the case, perform the following steps to regenerate the
RNETWORK.GLB file:

<OL><P><LI>Go to the GLB subdirectory on the postoffice where the RNETWORK.GLB file
   has not been updated. Rename the RNETWORK.GLB file to RNETWORK.OLD.

<P><LI>Run the Mail Administrator program on the same postoffice. Select
   Remote, Regenerate, Yes. The RNETWORK.GLB will be regenerated.

<P><LI>Go to a client and again download the postoffice list.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: If this solves the problem ensure that you are using the latest
versions of ADMIN.EXE (version 3.2.12 or later) and EXTERNAL.EXE (version
3.2.13 or later).
<P>
<P><h3>If ADMIN.NME Possibly Corrupted</h3>
 
<P>
If you are confident that the RNETWORK.GLB file is being properly updated,
the problem may lie with the client. On the client computer, go to the
WINDOWS/MSMAIL/MSRMT/NME subdirectory and rename the ADMIN.NME file to
ADMIN.OLD. Download the address list again.
