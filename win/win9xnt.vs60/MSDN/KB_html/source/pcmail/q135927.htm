The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail Gateway to MHS, version 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
You can specify how the Mail Gateway to MHS will function by using the
command-line options available with the gateway. These options are used in
the COMMAND option of the gateway definition on the MHS system.
<P>
You can find information on adding gateway definitions to the MHS system in
the Novell's MHS "Administrator's Guide."
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The available MHS Gateway commands are as follows:
<P>
<PRE>Option         Definition
</PRE> 
<P>
<PRE>-Dm            Drive option specifies the driver letter containing the
               Microsoft Mail data files. Drive letter M is the default
               drive, but in a case that Maildata is mapped to a different
               drive letter, that letter would need to be specified. For
               example, if Maildata was mapped to drive P, use -Dp.

-F             Dashed Address Format option is used with an MHS 1.11 host
               only. When this option is used, the MSMAIL address in the
               FROM field of an outgoing message is converted to the dashed
               address format. This is ignored if the gateway is on an MHS
               host 1.21 or later. Also when you use this option all
               components of the 10/10/10 address must be Name-8 strings.
               If not, the gateway will use full extended addressing.

-FS            Simple Address Format option specifies that the gateway
               should use the simple address format MAILBOX@GATEWAY when
               converting MSMAIL addresses to the MHS addresses. To use
               this option, the MAILBOX portion of the MSMAIL address must
               be in Name-8 string; otherwise the extended address format
               is used. Also the simple address format is only supported
               for users on a gateway postoffice. This option is ignore if
               the sender is on a downstream postoffice and the uses the
               default extended address format.

-H             Show All Headers option is used to force the display of all
               MHS headers in incoming mail. This option is normally only
               used in testing the gateway operation.

-HA            Expose Hidden Attachments option is used to expose the
               hidden attachments generated the MSMAIL system. These
               attachments contain information about OLE objects.

-In            Items option specifies the maximum number of mail messages
               to process each time the program is invoked by the MHS
               system. The default is I5 (5 messages). The maximum
               allowable setting is I50 (50 messages); anything greater
               is ignored.

-L[filename]   Log Error Messages option specifies the name of the file to
               which error messages will be logged. Type the full path,
               including the driver, directory, filename, and extension. If
               you do not specify a parameter or if you enter only -L,
               error messages are logged to the M:\LOG\MHSGATE.LOG (unless
               you specify another driver the -D option)

-Mn            Maximum Text Size option sets the maximum size of the
               messages text allowed by the gateway, where n is the maximum
               size in kilobytes. When a messages exceeds this size, the
               gateway converts the message text to an attachments. If you
               are using message encapsulation to send backboned mail (the
               default) and the message text exceeds the limit, the
               messages is not encapsulated.

-RE            Remove Encapsulation option is used to disable message
               encapsulation for outgoing mail. By default, all backboned
               mail (mail destined for postoffices defined as indirect via
               MHS and for which address mapping has been defined) is sent
               in encapsulated form to preserve all attributes of the
               MSMAIL message sent via MHS.

-Sn            Split Lines option allows you to specify where to split
               long message lines by entering the number of characters per
               line. MSMAIL can generate messages with lines up to 78
               characters. Some MHS user agents can handle lines up to 74
               characters. For outgoing mail (INPOST program), the default
               is to not split lines at all. For incoming mail (OUTPOST
               program), the default is to split lines at 78 characters.

-T             Use Mail Item Time option is recognized only by the OUTPOST
               program. For mail sent to MSMAIL from MHS, you can specify
               that you want to use the date, and time of the mail item
               getting received by the MSMAIL instead of the system date
               and time.

-V20           Backwards Compatibility option must be used if the Gateway
               to MHS is installed on a postoffice that uses version 2.1 or
               later of the External Mail program, but is also accessed by
               a version 2.0 External program or by any version 2.;0 MSMAIL
               gateway program. If you do not require compatibility with
               version 2.0 programs, do not use this option.
