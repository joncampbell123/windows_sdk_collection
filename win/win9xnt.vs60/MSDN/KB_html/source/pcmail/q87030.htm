The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail Gateway to SMTP, version 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Mail Gateway to SMTP Access disk, which comes with the
gateway product, is the only software needed to install the downstream
postoffice. It creates the SMTP address list files for the gateway
postoffice, and creates the SMTP mailbag and SMTP address list for
downstream postoffices.
<P>
To install the Access disk, place it in the floppy disk drive and type the
following command
<P>
<PRE>   &lt;x&gt;: install

</PRE>where &lt;x&gt; is the floppy disk drive letter. The installation program prompts
you for the drive of the Microsoft Mail database and the name of the
gateway postoffice. When the installation is complete, you receive the
message:
<P>
<PRE>   The installation is successful.

</PRE>You can also check the Mail Administrator program GATEWAY-SMTP option for
the options Create, Modify, and Delete. If these options appear, the
installation was successful.
<P>
If there is a hub postoffice between the downstream and gateway
postoffices, insert the network/PO for the intermediate postoffice at the
install prompts.
<P>
You need one Access disk per postoffice. To purchase additional ones,
contact Microsoft Inside Sales.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
After successful installation, the SMTP Gateway postoffice needs to be
configured.
<P>
<P><h3>To configure the gateway postoffice</h3>
 
<P>
The new downstream postoffice should be configured in the Administrator
program of the Gateway postoffice in the following places:

<OL><P><LI>Select External-Admin, Create.
   (Create an entry for the downstream postoffice. Also perform this step
   on the downstream postoffice for the gateway postoffice.)

<P><LI>Select Gateway, SMTP, Postoffices, Create.

<P><LI>Select Gateway, SMTP, Address-Map, Add.
   (The address map entry must have a unique SMTP domain name for the
   downstream postoffice. It cannot be the same as the domain name for
   any other postoffice.)
<P>
</OL><h3>To configure the smart host</h3>
 
<P>
In addition to these two steps, the mail routing host must also be
configured to deliver mail for the downstream postoffice to the SMTP
gateway computer. This is accomplished through the hosts table on the mail
routing host ("smart host") or through the Domain Name Service (DNS) on the
mail routing host.
<P>
<P><h3>Hosts Table</h3>
 
<P>
An entry in the hosts table may look like this:
<P>
<PRE>   123.123.123.123 hq.company.com
   123.123.123.123 sales.company.com

</PRE></OL>The IP address for the gateway PC is "123.123.123.123", the SMTP domain
name for the downstream postoffice is "sales.company.com", as configured in
step 2 above.
<P>
<P><h3>DNS</h3>
 
<P>
If DNS is used on the smart host, a mail exchanger (MX) record should be
added that associates the domain name for the downstream postoffice (from
step 2 above) to the domain name of the SMTP gateway computer. An example
might be:
<P>
<PRE>   sales.company.com.  MX 10  msmailgwy.company.com.

</PRE>In this example, the domain name for the downstream postoffice is
"sales.company.com", and the name of the SMTP gateway computer is
"msmailgwy.company.com".
<P>

"Configuring the SMTP Gateway and Domain Name Service (DNS)," and/or see
