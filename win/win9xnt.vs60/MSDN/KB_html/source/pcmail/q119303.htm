The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400, version 3.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400 may give the following
error:
<P>
<PRE>   ERROR 3 (RTS): RTS open refused (session limit exceeded)

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
So that it can always leave one outgoing connection available, the X.400
gateway version 3.2 can accommodate no more than three incoming connections
in a given time period. How the Gateway counts sessions during that time
period explains why this error is returned.
<P>
Consider this example sequence:

<UL><LI>The gateway receives an incoming connection and holds it open for
   a long time (because it has several messages to receive).

<LI>While the first connection is open, the gateway receives a second
   incoming connection, which it accepts, processes and closes.

<LI>While the first connection is still open, the gateway receives a third
   incoming connection, which it accepts, processes and closes.

<LI>At this point the gateway calculates that the three-session limit has
   been reached within a specific interval, so when a fourth incoming
   connection request is received it is refused at the RTS level.

<LI>The gateway refuses subsequent incoming connection requests until the
   first connection is finished and closed.
<P>
</UL>This is hardcoded and cannot be changed.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
If this error becomes a problem, install another X.400 gateway on another
postoffice to spread the mail traffic.
<P>
If you have External running, try starting the gateway with the -md option
(mailer disable). With -md on, the gateway puts incoming mail in the
postoffice, but lets External finish the job by moving the mail to the
recipient's mailbag. This also saves memory on the X.400 Gateway.
