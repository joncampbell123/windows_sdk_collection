<P>
When sending mail from Microsoft Mail to a host-based user, files can
be attached to a message in the same way as when sending to another
local MS Mail user. However, the recipient will receive one note and
one file per attachment in their reader list.
<P>
When an MS Mail user receives files from a host-based user, the message
text and each file arrive in the recipient's mailbox as a separate mail
item.
<P>
When sending to another MS Mail user via the Microsoft Mail Gateway to
PROFS, attached files are encapsulated so that the recipient cannot
tell that the mail item traveled through any gateways. This is known
as HUB mail, and is documented in the "Microsoft Mail Gateway to IBM
PROFS and OfficeVision LAN Administrator's Guide." In this case, one
message with attachments arrives in the recipient's mailbag.
