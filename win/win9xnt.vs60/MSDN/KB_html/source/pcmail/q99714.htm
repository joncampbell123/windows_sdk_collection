<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail Gateway to MHS, version 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
Lotus cc:Mail includes MHSLink software that connects to the MHS host,
which then sends the messages. Within cc:Mail, the users in MHS look like
another cc:Mail Post Office. The MHS host is spawned by the cc:Mail Router,
but this makes it difficult to do asynchronous connections from that host.
<P>
Version 3.0 of Microsoft Mail Gateway to MHS (MHS Gateway) must be defined
from the cc:Mail gateway as indirect, through the host that runs the
gateway. This is because the MHS host has to create messages for every
recipient going from Microsoft Mail to cc:Mail.
<P>
<P><h3>Standard Message Format (SMF)</h3>
 
<P>
The cc:Mail Gateway to MHS is Standard Message Format (SMF) 64 compliant.
This means messages can have only one recipient. If a message is sent from
Microsoft Mail to cc:Mail through MHS, addressed to multiple recipients,
the routing procedure in MHS splits the message up into the corresponding
number of messages and submits them to the cc:Mail gateway
<P>
The MHS Gateway supports SMF 70 by default, but SMF 64 can be implemented
by means of the -G64 option in the command line. The gateway setup
area, under Routes to Workgroups, Hosts or Gateways has an area where the
gateway version can be changed. This line appears only if you are
installing the gateway on an MHS version 1.21 or 1.5 host.
<P>
If you are installing the gateway on an MHS version 1.21 host, use SMF 64.
If you are installing the gateway on an MHS version 1.5 host, use SMF 70.
Also use SMF 70 on a NetWare Global MHS server (this is under the SMF
Gateways section).
<P>
<P><h3>Addressing</h3>
 
<P>
To add user names in cc:Mail as the administrator, add the remote
postoffice as described in the cc:Mail documentation.
<P>
To add an individual user, enter the address
<P>
<PRE>   POSTOFF {NETWORK/POSTOFFICE/MAILBOX}

</PRE>where POSTOFF is the locally defined postoffice. This allows cc:Mail to
send mail using the extended addressing format.
<P>
To send mail to an unlisted user on a defined remote postoffice, first
select the destination postoffice, and then type the full or concise
extended address of the Microsoft Mail user:
<P>
<PRE>   USER@GATEWAY

</PRE>When the message has been received by Microsoft Mail, choose Reply and the
cc:Mail address is displayed. In the Windows client, the friendly name
is displayed. Double-click the name to display the MHS addressing.
