The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0 and 3.0b
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If SHARE.EXE is not running with version 3.0 of Microsoft Mail for
Windows, the following error message may occur during the client
installation or upon loading the client:
<P>
<PRE>   Your message file could not be opened. To access your
   message file in its current location, mail requires that
   the MS-DOS utility SHARE.EXE be run before Windows is started.

</PRE>This error message may also be received even though SHARE may be
currently running on the workstation. This may be due to the network
server not running SHARE or an equivalent file locking scheme.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
By default, most networks account for file locking internally, thus
alleviating the need to run Share on the network server. However, some
networks such as Windows for Workgroups, LANtastic and NetWare Lite
may not load SHARE or an equivalent file locking scheme automatically.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To solve this problem, verify that SHARE is indeed running on the
server where the postoffice is located. If SHARE is not loaded on the
server, it must be loaded and the workstation must be completely
restarted for it to recognize the server change.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
SHARE.EXE is always required when version 3.0 Mail for Windows is
used. The 3.0b Windows client does not require SHARE if the user's
.MMF file is located on the server.
