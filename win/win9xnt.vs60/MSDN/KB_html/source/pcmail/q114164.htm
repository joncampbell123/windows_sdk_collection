The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Attempting to view a WordPerfect 5.1 or 5.2 for Windows document as an
attachment in Microsoft Mail for Windows with WordPerfect for Windows
running as a background application, will result in the following error
message:
<P>
<PRE>   The application could not be executed

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This error message is not caused by Microsoft Mail for PC Networks; it
occurs as a result of WordPerfect for Windows not supporting the Multiple
Document Interface (MDI).
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
According to WordPerfect Technical Support, this is a known issue with
WordPerfect and there is no workaround at this time. To open a WordPerfect
attachment from within any Windows application, you cannot have WordPerfect
running as a background application at the same time. For Microsoft Mail,
you must leave the Mail client, close WordPerfect for Windows, reenter the
Mail client, and then open the attachment.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The same error message can be generated and demonstrated without Microsoft
Mail running, as follows:

<OL><P><LI>Start WordPerfect for Windows and minimize it.

<P><LI>Either
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Again attempt to start WordPerfect for Windows from its icon.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      -or-
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - Use File Manager and try to run WPWIN.EXE.
</PRE><P>
</OL>WordPerfect for Windows is manufactured by WordPerfect Corporation, a
vendor independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise,
regarding this product's performance or reliability.
