The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article explains how to install version 3.2 of the Microsoft Mail for
Windows Postoffice Upgrade for Microsoft Windows for Workgroups.
<P>
The focus of these directions is based on working from the Windows for
Workgroups station on which the Windows for Workgroups postoffice is
installed. To complete the upgrade process, perform the following
steps. You may need to make adjustments, as needed, if your postoffice
is located on a Novell or LAN Manager server.
<P>
NOTE: Be sure all users on the postoffice have exited and signed out
of Mail before installing the upgrade.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To upgrade the existing Windows for Workgroups postoffice to a full
version 3.2 Microsoft Mail for PC Networks postoffice, run the
SETUP.EXE program from the Setup Postoffice disk. You will be prompted
with a series of screens and questions.
<P>
Follow the instructions, inserting disks as prompted, until the
upgrade process is finished. The screens and questions are as follows:

<UL><LI>Welcome screen
<P>
   Setup can do the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Update a Workgroup postoffice
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - Copy Microsoft Mail server programs
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - Copy Microsoft Mail client programs
</PRE>
<LI>Prompt screen
<P>
   Setup then prompts for:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Location of the postoffice data files
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - Administrators mailbox name and password
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - Postoffice and network name
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - If you are running gateways earlier than version 3.0
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - If you are moving the postoffice
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - Server programs to install
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - Client programs to install
</PRE>
<LI>Postoffice Directory Screen
<P>
   Please specify the directory containing the Workgroup postoffice. The
   postoffice must exist in this directory.
<P>
   Setup suggests the following directory:
<P>
<P><PRE>      C:\MAILDATA
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: The Windows for Workgroups postoffice may be located in
   C:\WINDOWS\WGPO or in another location. If you are not sure, check
   with your network administrator.

<LI>Mailbox screen
<P>
   Enter your administrator name:

<LI>Password screen
<P>
   Enter your password:

<LI>Gateway Installation screen
<P>
   Will you run Microsoft Mail gateways earlier than 3.0?

<LI>Postoffice Relocation screen
<P>
   No relocation
   Microsoft LAN Manager Compatible
   Novell

<LI>Server programs screen
<P>
   Select Server programs you want to install
<P>
   Done
   Administration and Utilities
   Server agents
   Modem scripts files
<P>
   NOTE: You must choose to install the Administration and Utilities
   programs here in order to access the postoffice administrator program
   ADMIN.EXE. This utility replaces the Windows for Workgroups
   Postoffice Manager. You will be prompted for a directory location
   for the Mail executable files.
<P>
   Setup suggests the following directory:
<P>
<P><PRE>      C:\MAILEXE
</PRE><P>
   WARNING: Do NOT specify the Windows directory.

<LI>Client Programs screen
<P>
   Select the client programs you want to install
<P>
   Done
   Windows and Presentation Manager
   MS-DOS
<P>
   NOTE: You should always install the MS-DOS-based workstation even if
   all your users will be running different workstation software. The
   MS-DOS client installation copies files needed by other Microsoft Mail
   components. It may also be helpful when troubleshooting the Mail
   system.
<P>
   NOTE: You must choose to install Windows and Presentation Manager
   client files here, if you plan to update your users' local
   workstations to the latest version of the Windows or Presentation
   Manager client. If you choosing not to install the files at this
   time, you must rerun this portion of Setup before you can complete
   the client upgrades.

<LI>Confirm Choices screen

<LI>Updating screen
<P>
   NOTE: You will see files being copied.

<LI>Installation Complete screen
<P>
   Setup has successfully installed Microsoft Mail Extensions.

<LI>From File Manager, share the mail executables directory with Full
   Rights. From File Manager, share the postoffice directory with Full
   Rights (if you have not already done so).

<LI>For Macintosh users only: Use the Apple Macintosh Workstation disk
   and refer to Chapter 1 of the Microsoft Mail "Administrator's
   Guide."

<LI>Locate the postoffice and use the ADMIN.EXE program on a
   nondedicated Windows for Workgroups server.
<P>
   NOTE: Nondedicated refers to a Windows for Workgroups computer being
   used as a workstation and as the postoffice server.
<P>
</UL><h3>Schedule+ Installation</h3>
 

<UL><LI>Create the Schedule+ Admin Mail account "adminsch." For more
   information about how to do this, see Chapter 2 of the Schedule+
   "Administrator's Guide."

<LI>Use the Schedule+ disks and follow the instructions in the
   Schedule+ for Windows "Administrator's Guide" to upgrade the server
   portion of Schedule+.
<P>
</UL>After the Windows for Workgroups postoffice has been upgraded to a
full Mail 3.2 postoffice, the administration functions are handled
through the MS-DOS-based Administrator program (ADMIN.EXE).
<P>
ADMIN.EXE is located in the Mail executables directory. By default,
the Administrator program looks for the postoffice on the current or
root directory of drive M. There are several ways to make the
Administrator program successfully locate the postoffice; use the
method best suited for your configuration:

<UL><LI>Use the -d command-line parameter.
<P>
   When using a drive other than M for the postoffice, you can specify
   that drive using the -d&lt;drive letter&gt; parameter. For example, if you
   want to use the N drive, use the following syntax:
<P>
<P><PRE>      c:\mailexe\admin -dn
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: The postoffice must be located in the current or root directory
   of the specified drive.
<P>
   The following is an example of incorrect usage of the -d parameter:
<P>
<P><PRE>      c:\mailexe\admin -dn:\wgpo
</PRE><P>
</UL>-or-

<UL><LI>Copy ADMIN.EXE to the root of the postoffice directory.
<P>
   You can copy ADMIN.EXE to the postoffice directory rather than use
   a drive map for the MAILEXE directory. The following example uses
   N:\WGPO as the postoffice location. Copy ADMIN.EXE from the MAILEXE
   directory to N:\WGPO. Then invoke the Administrator program with
   the following syntax:
<P>
<P><PRE>      n:\wgpo\admin -dn
</PRE><P>
</UL>-or-

<UL><LI>Use the MS-DOS SUBST command.
<P>
   If you are using a peer-to-peer network and the postoffice is
   located on a nondedicated server, you can elect to use the MS-DOS
   SUBST command to assign the root of drive M to the postoffice. You
   should add the SUBST command to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file. For
   example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      subst m: c:\windows\wgpo
</PRE><P>
</UL>The server-based portion of the mail system update is now complete.
You need to update the client side (local workstation files) for the
Windows-based and OS/2 Presentation Manager-based client, and the
Schedule+ client.
<P>
<P><h3>Windows and OS/2 Presentation Manager Upgrade</h3>
 
<P>
To complete this section, you must have specified that the Windows and
Presentation Manager client files be installed during the server-based
portion of setup.
<P>
Complete the following steps at each user's workstation:

<OL><P><LI>From File Manager, connect drive M to the shared postoffice
   directory.

<P><LI>Connect to the shared mail executables directory (any drive
   letter).

<P><LI>Double-click the SETUP.EXE file located in the mail executables
   directory. You will be prompted for a directory location to install
   Microsoft Mail.
<P>
   Setup suggests the following directory:
<P>
<P><PRE>      C:\MSMAIL
</PRE><P>
</OL>Follow the instructions until the Microsoft Mail Windows client
upgrade is complete.
<P>
<P><h3>Schedule+ Upgrade</h3>
 
<P>
Complete the following steps from each user's workstation:

<OL><P><LI>From File Manager, connect drive M to the shared postoffice
   directory.

<P><LI>Connect to the shared Schedule+ directory (any drive letter).

<P><LI>Double-click the SETUP.EXE file located in the shared Schedule+
   directory. You will be prompted for a directory location to install
   Schedule+.
<P>
</OL>Follow the instructions until the Schedule+ client upgrade is complete.
