<P><h2>Directory Synchronization Error and Status Messages #120 - 249</h2>
 
<P>
On Microsoft Mail for PC Networks version 3.0 Server Disk 1, there is a
file called DIRSYNC.TXT that contains the error codes used in directory
synchronization (Dir-Sync) and in the IMPORT utility for Mail. The errors
are logged in the DIRSYNC.LOG file.
<P>
<PRE>[120]   Requestor not registered
   The specified requestor is not registered with the directory server
   postoffice. Instruct the requestor administrator to register with
   the Administrator program Config Dir-Sync Requestor Registration
   command. The directory server administrator should also create the
   requestor with the Administrator program Config Dir-Sync Requestors
   Create command.

[123]   Could not compress file
   The directory server could not back up the master update file
   MSTTRANS.GLB or the server configuration file. Ensure that there is
   still a connection to the server and try the operation again. Also
   check that there is sufficient disk space to perform the
   compression.

[124]   Invalid transaction format
   Ensure that there is sufficient disk space to perform the
   operation.

   If the requestor is a foreign requestor, ensure that:
    - The system message is in the correct format and starts with [dirsync]
    - The foreign requestor did not forget to include an attachment file if
      one was specified
    - If there is an attachment file, it is in the correct format and
      starts with [dirsync-transactions]

   Wait at least one synchronization cycle and the problem should
   clear itself up.

[125]   Failure to copy attachment file
   Ensure that there is sufficient disk space at the directory server
   postoffice to perform the operation.

   If the attachment is from a foreign requestor, check that the
   foreign requestor did not forget to send an attachment with the
   system message. Wait at least one synchronization cycle as the
   problem will most likely clear up on its own.

[128]   Could not process requestor status report
   Ensure that there is still a connection to the server. Also ensure
   that there is sufficient disk space to receive the report. Wait at
   least one directory synchronization cycle and try the operation
   again. If the problem continues, contact Microsoft Product Support
   Services.

[129]   Could not find specified sync number
   Wait at least one synchronization cycle and the problem should
   clear on its own. If the problem continues, copy a backup of the
   MSTTRANS.GLB file, then ask all requestors to export their address
   lists.

[133]   Invalid Server Request
   Ensure that the directory server's requestor schedule does not have
   any errors. Check the requestor schedule. Ensure that there is
   enough time for the server mail to reach the requestor postoffice.

[136]   The local requestor is not registered
   Ensure that this postoffice is registered as the directory server
   with the Administrator program Config Dir-Sync Options command.

[150]   Could not append transactions to the updates file
   Ensure that:
    - There is sufficient disk space to perform the operation.
    - The computer running the Dispatch program has 640K of memory and
      that FILES=20 (minimum) in the CONFIG.SYS file.

   If the mail is from a foreign requestor, check that the foreign
   requestor did not forget to send an attachment with the system
   message. If the problem continues, wait at least one synchronization
   cycle as the problem will most likely clear up on its own.

[151]   Requestor configuration busy
   Try the operation again. If the problem continues, the REQCONF.GLB
   may be locked open. Contact your network vendor to determine how to
   find and close files that are locked open.

[154]   Non-delivery report from
   This is an information message. The requestor received a directory
   synchronization message that is not addressed to it and is not from
   a $SYSTEM (directory synchronization) mailbox. This message is put
   in the DIRSYNC.LOG file. The directory server may receive a
   directory synchronization message that is not addressed to a
   $SYSTEM mailbox. This message is redirected to the administrator.

[155]   Invalid DirSync profile from
   The directory server received a directory synchronization message
   with unknown TASK= values. The mail likely has a TASK= value that
   is not supported by the server. See [133]. This message is
   redirected to the directory server administrator who should notify
   the foreign requestor administrator of the problem.

[156]   Invalid DirSync password from
   The specified password in the directory synchronization system
   message does not match the password in that is registered with the
   directory server postoffice. The directory server administrator and
   the requestor administrator should determine which is the correct
   password.

[157]   DirSync software version out of sync
   Ensure that the directory server and all requestors have upgraded
   to version 3.0.

[158]   Requestor not registered
   See [120].

   The specified requestor is not registered with the directory server
   postoffice. Instruct the requestor administrator to register with
   the Administrator program Config Dir-Sync Requestor Registration
   command. The directory server administrator should also create the
   requestor with the Administrator program Config, Dir-Sync, Server,
   Requestors, Create command.

[159]   Failure to send update mail to requestor
   Ensure that:
    - There is still a connection to the server.
    - That there is sufficient disk space to receive the mail.
    - The computer running the Dispatch program has 640K of memory and
      that FILES=20 (minimum) in the CONFIG.SYS file.

   If the problem continues, wait at least one directory
   synchronization cycle and the problem should clear on its own.

[161]   Server configuration busy
   Try the operation again. If the problem continues, the SRVCONF.GLB
   may be locked open. Contact your network vendor to determine how to
   find and close files that are locked open.

[162]   Failure to transmit server updates
   Ensure that:
    - There is still a connection to the server.
    - There is sufficient disk space to receive the updates.
    - The computer running the Dispatch program has 640K of memory and
      that FILES=20 (minimum) in the CONFIG.SYS file.

   If the problem continues, wait at least one directory
   synchronization cycle and as the problem should clear on its own.

[163]   Failure to copy server updates
   Ensure that:
    - There is still a connection to the server.
    - There is sufficient disk space to copy the updates.
    - The computer running the Dispatch program has 640K of memory and
      that FILES=20 (minimum) in the CONFIG.SYS file.

   If the problem continues, wait at least one directory
   synchronization cycle and the problem should clear on its own.

[166]   Manual import required for
   The size of the message generated to send the directory
   synchronization updates to the specified requestor exceeds the
   limit set by the requestor. A manual import procedure as described
   in The Administrator's Guide is required.

[201]   Warning .USR file missing
   This is an information message. There is a postoffice without a
   list of users.

[202]   No Valid Postoffice found
   Try the operation again. If the problem continues, check for that
   the MASTER.GLB file is in the GLB directory. If it is not there, it
   may have been accidentally deleted and you should restore a backup
   of your data files. If it is there, it may be locked open. Contact
   your network vendor to determine how to find and close files that
   are locked open.

[203]   GAL Rebuild problem accessing files
   Ensure that:
    - There is sufficient disk space to perform the operation.
    - The computer running the Rebuild utility has 640K of memory and
      that FILES=20 (minimum) in the CONFIG.SYS file.
    - Novell users have sufficient access rights.

[204]   GAL Rebuild out of disk space
   The Rebuild utility needs extra temporary disk space during sort
   and merge operations. Ensure that there is sufficient disk space to
   perform the operation.

[249]   Not enough free file handles
   Ensure that the computer running the Rebuild utility has 640K of
   memory and that FILES=20 (minimum) in the CONFIG.SYS file.
