<P><h3>Scroll Bar on Compose Note Jumps Up and Down</h3>
 
Article ID: <B><A href="../pcmail/q80653.htm">Q80653</A></B>
<P>
In versions 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, the scroll
bars on a compose note may jump around when three or more lines are entered
very quickly.
<P>
 
<P><h3>No Split Menu Item When Message Finder Is Open</h3>
 
Article ID: <B><A href="../pcmail/q81419.htm">Q81419</A></B>
<P>
When the Message Finder viewer is open in versions 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 of
Microsoft Mail for Windows, the View menu does not contain the Split
command (although it is available in the view's system menu).
<P>
NOTE: All other views contain a Split command on the View menu.
<P>
 
<P><h3>Selected Order of Messages Open Out of Order</h3>
 
Article ID: <B><A href="../pcmail/q81552.htm">Q81552</A></B>
<P>
In versions 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, messages in
the Message Center Viewer (MCV), sometimes cannot be opened in the order in
which they are displayed.
<P>
Messages that are visible and highlighted in the MCV are opened in their
appropriate order, but selected messages that you have scrolled past in the
MCV are not. This same sort of behavior exists if you selectively highlight
random messages (hold the CTRL key and click with the mouse button) and
scroll past the initial MCV view.
<P>
 
<P><h3>Meeting Request Subject Incorrect in Shared Folder</h3>
 
Article ID: <B><A href="../pcmail/q82268.htm">Q82268</A></B>
<P>
If versions 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows receives a
Schedule+ for Windows meeting request and the message is then moved to a
shared folder, the subject line is changed to something like,
<P>
<PRE>   &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;!3/20/92 17:00-17...

</PRE>instead of the correct subject line as displayed in a private folder.
<P>
The right subject line appears when you read the message; only the
summary in the shared folder displays the incorrect subject.
<P>
 
<P><h3>Stack Fault When Spell Checking a Long Section of Text</h3>
 
Article ID: <B><A href="../pcmail/q82915.htm">Q82915</A></B>
<P>
Versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows sometimes display
this error message when spell checking a very long string of characters
containing no blank spaces:
<P>
<PRE>   Stack Fault in MSSPELL.DLL

</PRE> 
<P><h3>Err Msg: This Name or Comment Is Too Long</h3>
 
Article ID: <B><A href="../pcmail/q82921.htm">Q82921</A></B>
<P>
When creating or modifying a shared folder in version 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 of
Microsoft Mail for Windows, you may receive this error message if the name
or comment exceeds the maximum length:
<P>
<PRE>   This name or comment is too long. Type a shorter name or comment.

</PRE> 
<P><h3>Shared Folder Status Bar Has No Message Count</h3>
 
Article ID: <B><A href="../pcmail/q82922.htm">Q82922</A></B>
<P>
The status bar in version 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows
does not display the message count of an open shared folder.
<P>
 
<P><h3>No Paperclip Icon on Message with OLE Object</h3>
 
Article ID: <B><A href="../pcmail/q84884.htm">Q84884</A></B>
<P>
If you move a message with an object linking and embedding (OLE) object to
a shared folder in version 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows,
the icon next to the message does not display a paperclip. If you move the
message back to a private folder, the paperclip icon reappears.
<P>
This occurs only with OLE objects, not with regular file attachments.
<P>
 
<P><h3>Modified Status Lost in Move to Shared Folder</h3>
 
Article ID: <B><A href="../pcmail/q85167.htm">Q85167</A></B>
<P>
Moving a modified message to a shared folder in version 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2
of Microsoft Mail for Windows, causes the modified status to become lost.
Modified messages are identified by an asterisk (*) to the left of the
From line, for example, *From: John Doe.
<P>
 
<P><h3>Setup Does Not Add SHARE.EXE to AUTOEXEC.BAT</h3>
 
Article ID: <B><A href="../pcmail/q85199.htm">Q85199</A></B>
<P>
If you boot a machine from the floppy drive before running the Setup
program for version 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, the
AUTOEXEC.BAT file on the boot disk does not get modified.
<P>
For instance, the Setup program prompts you to add the line SHARE.EXE to
the AUTOEXEC.BAT file if you want SHARE loaded automatically. However, when
you add the line, it is not written to the AUTOEXEC.BAT on the boot disk or
the hard drive.
<P>
 
<P><h3>Packaged Object Icon Changes After Reading</h3>
 
Article ID: <B><A href="../pcmail/q85672.htm">Q85672</A></B>
<P>
With version 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, the icon for
an object embedded within a message may change after the object is read.
<P>
 
<P><h3>Two OLE Objects on One Line Print on Two Lines</h3>
 
Article ID: <B><A href="../pcmail/q85695.htm">Q85695</A></B>
<P>
Multiple object linking and embedding (OLE) objects placed on the same
line in version 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows are
printed on separate lines.
<P>
 
<P><h3>Embedded Paintbrush Object Does Not Print Color</h3>
 
Article ID: <B><A href="../pcmail/q85967.htm">Q85967</A></B>
<P>
Color is lost when you print a version 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 Microsoft Mail
for Windows message containing an embedded Windows version 3.1 Paintbrush
picture.
<P>
 
<P><h3>Excel 4.0 Chart May Appear Smaller Than Normal</h3>
 
Article ID: <B><A href="../pcmail/q85968.htm">Q85968</A></B>
<P>
A Microsoft Excel version 4.0 for Windows chart embedded in a version 3.0,
3.0b, or 3.2 Microsoft Mail for Windows message sometimes appears smaller
than normal.
<P>
 
<P><h3>Multiple Update Prompts With OLE Objects</h3>
 
Article ID: <B><A href="../pcmail/q85969.htm">Q85969</A></B>
<P>
When you print a message in version 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for
Windows that contains an object linking and embedding (OLE) object, a
dialog box prompts you to update information even if the OLE object is
currently updated.
<P>
 
<P><h3>Missing Information in Paste Special Dialog Box</h3>
 
Article ID: <B><A href="../pcmail/q85970.htm">Q85970</A></B>
<P>
Version 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows does not display
file information correctly in the Pasted Special Option dialog box when
an object linking and embedding (OLE) object is placed in a message.
<P>
 
<P><h3>Space Requirements Incorrect on Custom Setup</h3>
 
Article ID: <B><A href="../pcmail/q86003.htm">Q86003</A></B>
<P>
When you run the Custom Setup for version 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 of Microsoft
Mail for Windows, the required disk space reported might be incorrect
depending on whether the files already exist on the disk.
<P>
 
<P><h3>Unexpected Exit Permanently Locks Shared Folder</h3>
 
Article ID: <B><A href="../pcmail/q86082.htm">Q86082</A></B>
<P>
If a shared folder is open and version 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 of Microsoft
Mail for Windows exits unexpectedly, the shared folder will not be
unlocked and therefore cannot be deleted.
<P>
 
<P><h3>OLE Object Redraws Slowly in Message</h3>
 
Article ID: <B><A href="../pcmail/q86090.htm">Q86090</A></B>
<P>
When you compose a message in version 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail
for Windows that contains an object linking and embedding (OLE) object
with text above and below it, the screen redraws of the OLE object may be
very slow.
<P>
 
<P><h3>OLE Apps Have Unexpected Window Stacking Order</h3>
 
Article ID: <B><A href="../pcmail/q86091.htm">Q86091</A></B>
<P>
In version 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, using the
ALT+TAB function to toggle between applications and close the object
linking and embedding (OLE) Server application, sometimes causes an
unexpected window stacking order.
<P>
 
<P><h3>Highlighting OLE Objects Within Message</h3>
 
Article ID: <B><A href="../pcmail/q86092.htm">Q86092</A></B>
<P>
In version 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, if you compose
a message containing an object linking and embedding (OLE) object followed
by a large block of text, you may have trouble highlighting the text and
the OLE object.
<P>
 
<P><h3>Attach Dialog Box May Update Improperly</h3>
 
Article ID: <B><A href="../pcmail/q86093.htm">Q86093</A></B>
<P>
If you attempt to attach from a floppy disk after removing it, version 3.0,
3.0b, or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows sometimes displays this
incorrect error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Cannot find this file.
   Please verify that the correct path and filename are given.

</PRE>The expected error should be
<P>
<PRE>   Cannot read drive "x"
   Please verify the drive door is closed and that the disk is formatted.

</PRE>where x is the floppy disk drive.
<P>
 
<P><h3>Problems Attaching MSMAIL.EXE in Foreign Windows</h3>
 
Article ID: <B><A href="../pcmail/q86184.htm">Q86184</A></B>
<P>
If you use version 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows with
the French or German edition of Microsoft Windows version 3.1, attaching
the MSMAIL.EXE file to a message causes the system to become unstable,
and you have to restart the Windows 3.1 operating environment. This
problem occurs only with foreign editions of Windows version 3.1.
<P>
 
<P><h3>Drag/Drop Makes Folder Hierarchy Display Incorrect</h3>
 
Article ID: <B><A href="../pcmail/q86315.htm">Q86315</A></B>
<P>
In version 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, the folder
hierarchy display can become incorrect after you drag-and-drop folders
from the top level to a lower level two or more times in succession.
Scrolling the list up or down corrects the display.
<P>
 
<P><h3>From Field Changes Friendly Name to Login Name</h3>
 
Article ID: <B><A href="../pcmail/q86316.htm">Q86316</A></B>
<P>
In version 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows moving a message
to a shared folder changes the friendly name (for example, Karen White) in
the From field to the login name (for example, karenwh).
<P>
 
<P><h3>Message Finder Icon Does Not Update</h3>
 
Article ID: <B><A href="../pcmail/q86317.htm">Q86317</A></B>
<P>
In version 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, the Message
Finder icon may continue to display an envelope when its message has
actually been opened or deleted.
<P>
 
<P><h3>Update Message when Closing Unfinished OLE Object</h3>
 
Article ID: <B><A href="../pcmail/q86319.htm">Q86319</A></B>
<P>
In version 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, if you exit
while composing a note containing an unfinished object linking and
embedding (OLE) object (where Mail is the client document and the OLE
server is open and no update has been done) you see the standard OLE
"Do you want to update..." message even when the note being composed is
not the current active window.
<P>
 
<P><h3>Cannot Minimize Message Finder Using Keyboard</h3>
 
Article ID: <B><A href="../pcmail/q86321.htm">Q86321</A></B>
<P>
When running version 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows under
Microsoft Windows version 3.1, the Minimize option is unavailable in the
Control menu of a new Message Finder, if you access it using the
combination ALT+SPACEBAR, RIGHT ARROW key.
<P>
This problem occurs only when you use a new Message Finder. Once you have
minimized and restored Message Finder, the Minimize option is available.
<P>
 
<P><h3>Creating Subfolders Illegally Under Shared Folders</h3>
 
Article ID: <B><A href="../pcmail/q86324.htm">Q86324</A></B>

In version 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, you can create
a subfolder under a shared folder for which you have no privileges.
<P>
 
<P><h3>Text in Comment Field Not Selected</h3>
 
Article ID: <B><A href="../pcmail/q86325.htm">Q86325</A></B>
<P>
In version 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, if you select
Folder Properties from the File menu, the text in the Comment field is
not selected when it has the focus. To select the text in the Comment
field you must press TAB. (Developers should note this when developing
scripts to be executed against Mail for Windows.)
<P>
 
<P><h3>Header Displayed in Message Body</h3>
 
Article ID: <B><A href="../pcmail/q86329.htm">Q86329</A></B>
<P>
When a message is sent to a shared folder from a Microsoft Mail for PC
Networks, MS-DOS workstation, then opened in version 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 of
Microsoft Mail for Windows, the header information is displayed in the
message text.
<P>
 
<P><h3>Cannot Forward or Reply on Return Receipts</h3>

<P>
Normally, in version 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, the
Forward, Reply, and Reply All options are not available when a return

<P>

</PRE> 
<P><h3>Change Default Printer in Windows Not Change in Mail</h3>
 
Article ID: <B><A href="../pcmail/q88371.htm">Q88371</A></B>
<P>
Changing the default printer driver for version 3.1 of Microsoft Windows
does not change the printer driver for version 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 of

<P>
 
<P><h3>Custom Dictionary Not Loaded When it Should Be</h3>
 
Article ID: <B><A href="../pcmail/q91730.htm">Q91730</A></B>
<P>
If you press the F7 key to spell check a message in version 3.0, 3.0b, or

an error in loading the spell checker.
<P>
 
<P><h3>Fault in 8514.DRV After Typing in a Text Box</h3>
 
Article ID: <B><A href="../pcmail/q93238.htm">Q93238</A></B>
<P>
When composing a message in version 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for

<P>
 
<P><h3>Backup MMF Allows Composing But Not Sending</h3>
 
Article ID: <B><A href="../pcmail/q93242.htm">Q93242</A></B>
<P>
When using a backup of your Mail Message File (MMF) in version 3.0, 3.0b,
or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, you sometimes can compose a message
but cannot transmit it to the postoffice. The sent message just sits in
your outbox.
<P>
 
<P><h3>Appears to Hang When Printing from Shared Folder</h3>
 
Article ID: <B><A href="../pcmail/q93566.htm">Q93566</A></B>

Article ID: <B><A href="../pcmail/q93567.htm">Q93567</A></B>
<P>
In version 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, choosing Select

BACKSPACE key on the line containing the attachment or on the line below
it.
<P>
 
<P><h3>No Beep When Requested for New Mail</h3>
 
Article ID: <B><A href="../pcmail/q93573.htm">Q93573</A></B>
<P>
In version 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, the computer
does not beep when a new message arrives. Even if you have set the option
to alert you when new mail arrives, the envelope flashes, as it should, but

<P>
 
<P><h3>Wrong Button Discussed in "Find a Name" Help Topic</h3>
 
Article ID: <B><A href="../pcmail/q93574.htm">Q93574</A></B>

Article ID: <B><A href="../pcmail/q102665.htm">Q102665</A></B>
<P>
When you save a message to a file, version 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 of Microsoft
Mail for Windows does not determine if there is enough disk space before it
starts writing the file. If the file already exists, Mail overwrites it. If
there is not enough disk space, Mail truncates the file and displays this
alert:
<P>
<PRE>   There was an unknown disk error. Some data was written disk.

</PRE>NOTE: This message should say "written to disk."

</PRE> 
<P><h3>Address Book Does Not Limit Extended Characters</h3>
 
Article ID: <B><A href="../pcmail/q103449.htm">Q103449</A></B>
<P>
Versions 3.0, 3.0b, 3.1, and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows do not
check the validity of characters typed in fields in the Address Book
and its related dialog boxes. Therefore, invalid characters can be
typed in fields.
<P>
For example, you can type letters in the Fax Number box. Data checking
occurs only for fields that require data to be entered and for
carriage return-linefeeds (for the Personal Address Book).
<P>
You can also type invalid characters in the New User dialog box, and
the Address Book will accept these characters.

In versions 3.0, 3.0b, 3.1, and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, and
version 3.1 of Microsoft Mail for Windows for Workgroups, when you try
to read a message that is the maximum size possible, the following
warning appears and the last two characters of the message are
truncated:
<P>
<PRE>   The message is too large to fit into memory all at once.
   Some of it will not be displayed.

</PRE>A related problem occurs if the message contains an attachment as the
last character. When the message is saved or sent, and then read again
by the sender, Mail experiences a general protection (GP) fault.

<P>
You cannot use a Microsoft Word for Windows macro to start version 3.0,

<P>
When you try to import a backed-up Mail Message File (MMF) into
version 3.0b, 3.1, or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, Mail asks you
how to handle duplicate messages. If you choose Save All Messages,
Mail copies messages from the imported MMF file except for those that
are duplicates with the same modification date.
<P>
This may be confusing because some messages from the MMF file will be
copied into the destination folder, while others may not.
<P>

Article ID: <B><A href="../pcmail/q103944.htm">Q103944</A></B>
<P>
When you copy a large number of messages (about 800, possibly less)
to a shared folder, versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for
Windows cause a general protection (GP) fault in the MSSFS.DLL file.
<P>
 
<P><h3>Header Fields May Be Misaligned When Redrawn</h3>
 
Article ID: <B><A href="../pcmail/q103958.htm">Q103958</A></B>
<P>

<P>
In versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, trying to
jump to the last name in the Address List by typing the character "z"
twice ("zz"), returns the following error:
<P>

<P><h3>TrueType Fonts Do Not Work Properly with Mail</h3>
 
Article ID: <B><A href="../pcmail/q104084.htm">Q104084</A></B>
<P>
Versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows allow you
to specify both a normal (proportional) font and a fixed (nonproportional)

sorted automatically by their From field.
<P>
 
<P><h3>Mail Stops Downloading Messages When .MBG Is Detected</h3>
 
Article ID: <B><A href="../pcmail/q104277.htm">Q104277</A></B>

When you use versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows
to download messages from the .MBG file, you are disconnected if Mail
encounters a corrupt message, and Mail does not download any more valid
messages.

<P>
In version 3.0, 3.0b or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows and version 3.0
of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, OS/2 workstation, Mail actually
checks for new messages at twice the rate displayed in the Mail Options
dialog box. For example, if the Check For New Mail Every X Minutes
option is set to 5, Mail checks for new messages every 10 minutes.

<P>
In versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, the Windows
client will rebuild a corrupt folder without displaying any type of status
message. This may cause you to assume the client is hung when it is
actually performing a rebuild operation.
<P>
 
<P><h3>Global Address List Name Search Returns All Names</h3>
 
Article ID: <B><A href="../pcmail/q108026.htm">Q108026</A></B>
<P>
In versions 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, when
performing a name search on the Global Address List (GAL), if the selection
