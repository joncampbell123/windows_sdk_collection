The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
With version 3.2 of the message transfer agent (MTA), when you press F2,
one of the status messages that may appear is UNINIT. The UNINIT Status
Message is an indication that the following events occurred:

<UL><LI>The MTA successfully connected to the Server having the postoffice.

<LI>The MTA was able to read the MASTER.GLB file of the postoffice in the
   UNINIT status.

<LI>The MTA failed to access information needed to complete the
   initialization process. This information is normally obtained by reading
   several files from the postoffice.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The following circumstances can cause the UNINIT status to appear on the
status screen of the MTA.

<UL><LI>An intermittent network could allow the MTA to attach to the server but
   fail to download information into memory. The MASTER.GLB file is only
   176 bytes and is likely to be readable even on a poorly performing
   network. Other necessary files may contain much more data and would be
   more likely to fail on an intermittent network.

<LI>Lack of adequate access rights. The MTA must have complete rights to the
   postoffice database. On a Novell server, the Filescan right is required,
   but the Supervisor right is not.

<LI>A necessary file may be locked open. Confirm that ACCESS2.GLB,
   GROUP.GLB, NETWORK.GLB, and all .XTN files are not locked open.

<LI>If you are running multiple MTAs, another MTA may have one of the
   necessary files locked open at the exact time this MTA was trying to
   initialize. The MTA will try to initialize from the drive again when the
   IntervalUpdate time is reached. By default, the IntervalUpdate value is
   set to 5 minutes. If the IntervalUpdate has been set to zero, no attempt
   to re-initialize will occur.
