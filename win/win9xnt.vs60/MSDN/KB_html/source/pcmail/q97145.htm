<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Mail System Selector provided with Microsoft Mail Remote
version 3.2 for Windows does not delete extended command entries if
you interrupt and restart the application.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Selector can report an incorrect driver as the current driver.
When Mail starts, various error messages appear that depend on the
previous driver and on the new driver.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
If you have difficulty starting Mail Remote for Windows immediately
after you change Mail drivers, run the Selector program. Select the
last driver you chose more than once. This procedure resolves the
problem for some drivers.
<P>
Running the Selector program a second time and choosing the driver
multiple times appears to correct the problem, even though remote
extended commands remain in the MSMAIL.INI file.
<P>
Because Mail supports various drivers, no single method is available
to resolve this problem. However, for certain drivers, using the
Selector utility to choose the new driver repeatedly (without choosing
an alternate driver between choices) can resolve some problems.
