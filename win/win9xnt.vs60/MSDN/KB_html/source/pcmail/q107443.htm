The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.2 and 3.2a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft provides a replacement for the ADMIN.EXE file included with
versions 3.2 and 3.2a of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks.
<P>
For complete information about obtaining and installing the ADMIN.EXE file,
see the following sections:

<UL><LI>To download the updated file
<LI>To update your ADMIN.EXE file
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This update contains ADMIN.EXE, a replacement file for the ADMIN.EXE file
included with versions 3.2 and 3.2a of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks. This
update includes the following modifications:

<UL><LI>With the earlier version of this file, a corrupt .MAI file could be
   created when you export the address list to a large number of
   postoffices. ADMIN.EXE has been modified so that the correct .MAI
   file is created when address lists are exported.

<LI>With the earlier version of this file, a corrupt SRVCONF.GLB file
   could be created when you add a directory synchronization (Dir-
   Sync) requestor on a computer that has an EtherExpress(TM) 16
   network card and is running the Ethernet_II protocol. ADMIN.EXE has
   been modified so that it uses a buffer size of 512 bytes instead of
   1K for its buffered I/O.

<LI>If a Mail Remote for Windows user forgets his or her password or if
   the password is changed while the remote driver is in use, the
   password can now be reset.
<P>
   NOTE: This password reset only applies to the server files. Local
   .MMF files will not be affected by this change.
<P>
   Notes:
   ------
<P>
   - To resolve this problem, two files must be updated: the
<P><PRE>     ADMIN.EXE file (included in this update) and the MSRMTUI.DLL file
     (update included in MSRMTUI.EXE on the MSL).
</PRE><P>
   - To reset the password, you must ensure that the user's data
<P><PRE>     disk was created using ADMIN.EXE version 3.2.12.
</PRE>
<LI>Local postoffice users added with the ADMIN.EXE utility will no
   longer be assigned an invalid identification number if the TID.GLB
   file is locked open. Also, batch creation of local postoffice users
   with the ADMIN.EXE utility while the TID.GLB file is locked open no
   longer results in the same invalid identification number being assigned
   to multiple users.

<LI>When you use ADMIN.EXE to change the routing type defined for a hub
   postoffice, the routing type definition for any downstream
   postoffice is also updated to match the routing type of the hub
   postoffice.

<LI>When you use ADMIN.EXE to remove users from a global group, access
   to group folders associated with that global group is also removed.

<LI>Correct figures are now reported when you use the Mail Administrator
   program to create reports that involve multiple postoffices with more
   than 32,768 users.
<P>
</UL>This replacement file also resolves the following problems that can occur
when you use version 3.2 or 3.2a of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks:

<UL><LI>Groups with names 10 characters long can now be deleted successfully
   on other postoffices. With versions of ADMIN.EXE earlier than 3.2.12,
   if a group was deleted from a postoffice participating in Dir-Sync
   and its name was 10 characters long, other postoffices, including the
   Dir-Sync server, were unable to delete the group from their .USR files.

<LI>When the Admin account mailbox is greater than eight characters in
   length, the Keep Updates number will no longer change when you change
   the Administrator's Name in Config, DirSync, Server, Options.
<P>
   NOTE: To fix this problem, you need ADMIN.EXE version 3.2.13 or
   later (included in this update) and SRVMAIN.EXE version 3.2.13 or
   later, LISTDS.EXE version 3.2.1, and SCONFIX.EXE (updates included in
   SRVUPD.EXE on the MSL).

<LI>When you modify a remote client's account using Admin, Local Admin,
   Modify, the remote user's Custom View is no longer reset to the
   Default view.

<LI>ADMIN.EXE will now report an error writing to nnnnnnnn.XTN file,
   if locked open by another process.

   TITLE     : How to Obtain Microsoft Support Files from Online
               Services

</PRE>After you download ADMUPD.EXE to a clean directory, run it (by
typing "admupd" at the MS-DOS prompt) to extract the contents of
the file. You should receive the following files:
<P>
<PRE>   ADMIN.EXE (534,141 bytes, dated 04-13-95, 4:02 P.M.)
   README.TXT

</PRE><h3>To update your ADMIN.EXE file</h3>
 
<P>
At the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following and press ENTER
<P>
<PRE>   copy &lt;path&gt;:\admin.exe &lt;destination&gt;

</PRE>where &lt;path&gt; is the drive and directory where you ran the self-
extracting ADMUPD.EXE file and &lt;destination&gt; is the drive and
directory where your ADMIN.EXE file currently resides. For example,
if you ran the self-extracting file from the TEST directory on
drive D, and your ADMIN.EXE file is located in the MAILEXE directory
on drive C, type the following command:
<P>
<PRE>   copy d:\test\admin.exe c:\mailexe
