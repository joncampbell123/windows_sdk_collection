The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail Gateway to SMTP, version 3.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Downstream postoffices (PO) with the SMTP Access Component installed can
not send SMTP messages; the mail messages are still in the SMTP queue and
have not been picked up by the External Mail program. However, Microsoft
Mail messages are sent successfully in both directions from the downstream
postoffice to the gateway postoffice, and incoming SMTP mail is
successfully routed to the Downstream postoffice. No errors are listed in
the SESSION.LOG, and mail is not returned with an error.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
After you install the SMTP Access Component on the downstream postoffice,
the gateway postoffice is deleted from the External-Admin option in
ADMIN.EXE. Then it is added back (one reason would be for troubleshooting
purposes).
<P>
The NETWORK.GLB file was not updated to show the correct hex value for the
gateway postoffice's MBG and KEY files. When a user on the downstream
postoffice sends SMTP mail, it is being put into the SMTP &lt;hexid&gt;.MBG and
&lt;hexid&gt;.KEY files; however, the External Mail program does not know what
postoffice to send the SMTP Mail to. As a result, it ignores the mail.
<P>
ADMIN.EXE should recognize that the gateway postoffice is a hub postoffice,
but it does not and subsequently allows the administrator to delete it.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
NOTE: Debugging the NETWORK.GLB file and changing the hex value to the
correct hex value (matching the gateway postoffice's hex value in the XTN
file) does NOT fix this problem and is NOT recommended.
<P>
When the SMTP gateway postoffice reference is deleted from a downstream
postoffice with the SMTP Access Component installed, you must run the
following to remove the SMTP Access Component from the downstream PO:
<P>
<PRE>   install -r

</PRE>Then run INSTALL to put the files back again and to update the NETWORK.GLB
and other files.
<P>
This information may also apply to other gateways.
