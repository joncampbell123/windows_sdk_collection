The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, Macintosh workstation, versions 3.x
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run the Macintosh client, you may get the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Before you can use private folders, your Administrator must run
   the Reset function on your user id.

</PRE>If you click the OK button, the Macintosh Mail client opens as designed;
however, the Private Folders icon is dimmed.
<P>
If you try to access your private folders from the Microsoft Mail for PC
Networks, MS-DOS workstation, you will get the following error:
<P>
<PRE>   Notice 127 Private Folder Index Missing.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The &lt;HEX-ID&gt;.IDX file is missing from the FOLDERS\LOC\&lt;HEX-ID&gt; directory on
the server.
<P>
You may also see this message if the mailbox was created with a version of
the Mail Administrator's program (ADMIN.EXE) earlier than 2.1b. Version
2.1b of ADMIN.EXE is dated 04-03-91 and is 290,801 bytes in size.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
If you had private folders, you can restore the index file from a recent
backup. The program FIXIDX can also be used if no backup is available.
FIXIDX regenerates the &lt;HEX-ID&gt;.IDX file from the existing private folder
files.
<P>
NOTE: Running FIXIDX will result in the loss of all folder names.
<P>
For more details about FIXIDX, please refer to Microsoft Application Note
WA0641, Database Maintenance Utilities, available from Microsoft Product
Support Services. FIXIDX is also included with Microsoft Mail Server
version 3.5 on the disk labeled Utilities.
<P>
If you did not have any private folders, or the above procedure was not
successful, you can use the Reset function in the Mail Administrator's
program (ADMIN.EXE) to generate a new index file.
<P>
If a version earlier than 2.1b of the Mail Administrator's program was used
to create the mailbox, run the Reset function with version 2.1b or later of
ADMIN.EXE to resolve the problem.
<P>

Workstation Software for the Macintosh "User's Guide."
