The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Host Access for IBM PROFS and OfficeVision, version 3.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In versions 3.2 and earlier of Microsoft Host Access for IBM PROFS and
OfficeVision, the PROFSIN CSI file may get stuck in XEDIT mode while
processing messages from the local-area network (LAN).
<P>
This brings the processing of messages to a halt, and eventually causes the
gateway to exit out to MS-DOS with a host timeout error. The most
noticeable sign that this problem has occurred is that when you toggle to
the host, Host Access is in the XEDIT screen with an empty file.
<P>
This problem is known to occur in versions 1.1 and 2.0 of VM/ESA.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs after the PROFS gateway has unloaded the PROFSIN.DAT
file from the VMGATE subdirectory on the LAN to the host as PROFSIN CSI.
The Host Access code begins processing the information in the data in the
PROFSIN CSI file, one record at a time. As each record is processed, it is
deleted; eventually, all records are processed and the file is empty.
<P>
At this point, the Host Access code in the PWAFSCSI XEDIT file issues a
COMMAND FILE command to exit the file. However, you cannot issue the
COMMAND FILE command on an empty file in VM/ESA 1.1. Therefore, the COMMAND
FILE command is ignored, and the file remains open.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
On the VM ID's 193 disk, there is a file called PWAFSCSI XEDIT. Place the
following code at the end of the file, right below the line issuing the
COMMAND FILE command:
<P>
<PRE>   &amp;IF RC NE 0
   QQUIT

</PRE>This code allows the Host Access component to close the PROFSIN CSI
file after all the records have been processed; the Host Access component
then can continue normal operation.
