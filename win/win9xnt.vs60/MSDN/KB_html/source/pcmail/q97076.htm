The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail Remote, Windows Client, version 3.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If you have a network interface card (NIC) installed on the system on which
you run Microsoft Mail Remote version 3.2 for Windows, you should configure
the NIC such that it does not use Interrupt Request (IRQ) 2, 3, or 4. Use
IRQ 5 or higher to avoid problems with using the serial port or with its
performance. (No matter which IRQ you use, verify that it does not conflict
with another device.)
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Personal computers commonly use hardware interrupt requests to support
different peripheral equipment (or accessories). One of these peripherals,
apart from your modem, can include a NIC to connect your computer to a
local-area network (LAN).
<P>
Many common conflicts occur when two peripherals attempt to service the
same IRQ. Some common uses of IRQ vectors are as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   IRQ 2: forwards requests to IRQ 9 or higher
   IRQ 3: serial ports COM2 and COM4
   IRQ 4: serial ports COM1 and COM3
   IRQ 5: second parallel printer port (LPT2)
   IRQ 7: first parallel printer port (LPT1)

</PRE>Several devices can use the serial communication ports, including printers,
mice, and modems. The IRQ vectors for COM1 through COM4 are reversed. If a
modem uses COM1, it must use IRQ4, and so on.
<P>
Additionally, the IRQ with a lower number has higher priority for service
(in other words, IRQ 2 has priority over IRQ 3).
<P>
If your network card is installed and configured for IRQ 2, and your
network is busy, serial communications on IRQ 3 or IRQ 4 can be impaired.
If the IRQ 2 interrupt handler is busy for too long when a serial port
interrupt occurs, the port will lose characters.
<P>
On an active network, if the network card is configured with a lower
interrupt number than the serial interrupt, the port will lose a character
occasionally. When this occurs, the packet that contains the character must
be resent, and all packets in the modem buffers must be resent. This
process can be time consuming, expensive, and can lead to unacceptably
higher communication error rates.
<P>
If you can assign the network card to an IRQ that is not currently used on
your PC, such as IRQ 5 (if you do not have a second parallel printer port
installed), you can minimize data loss and its consequent retransmission
caused by a busy network.
