The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail Multitasking MTA for Windows NT, version 3.5
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you try to monitor a service from the Microsoft Mail Service Manager,
the Monitor.exe command box will flash and disappear.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
There are several reasons you will see the above behavior:

<UL><LI>The External.ini file settings for the service are incorrect.

<LI>The service is already being monitored, either from this
   computer or remotely.

<LI>The service is not started.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To find out more specific information on why the monitor is failing, run
Monitor.exe program from a command prompt.
<P>
Notes:

<UL><LI>Monitor.exe is installed by default in the \Winnt35 directory.

<LI>You may see one or more the following errors:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Warning: Unable to find specified instance INI section.
      Error: Service is already being monitored. (231)
      Error: Service instance not found. Service may not be running. (2)
</PRE><P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following are the error messages and possible causes:

<UL><LI>Warning: Unable to find specified instance INI section
<P>
   The cause for this error is that the External.ini requires an
   Instance name.
<P>
   For additional information on how to correct this, please see the
   following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../pcmail/q130396.htm">Q130396</A></B>
<PRE></PRE>      TITLE     : Err Msg: Unable to Find Specified Instance INI.

</PRE><LI>Error: Service is already being monitored. (231)
<P>
   You can only launch the monitor one time for each service instance. If
   you receive this error, check the Task Manager (double-click the
   desktop) and see if there are multiple listings for
   C:\Winnt35\monitor.exe.
<P>
   If there are multiple listings, check each one to see if it is
   monitoring the instance you are trying to monitor. If not, then
   there may be a remote instance of monitor running for this specific
   instance.

<LI>Error: Service instance not found. Service may not be running. (2)
<P>
   The Mail Multitasking MTA for Windows NT (NTMMTA) Service is
   initially run either during startup of Windows NT or after startup
   by going into Control Panel, Services and running the service.
<P>
   If you try to monitor a service instance and receive this error, go
   into Control Panel, Services and ensure that the service is running.
   If the status states that is has been started, yet you still receive
   this error when run the monitor, you will want to stop the service
   and restart it.
<P>
   If the service has been stopped previously from the monitor window,
   it will still show that it is started in Control Panel, Services
   until it has been stopped there also.
<P>
