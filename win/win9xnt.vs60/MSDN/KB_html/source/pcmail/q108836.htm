The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail for PC Networks Postoffice Diagnostics Utility,
   version 3.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article lists and describes all the entries in the Microsoft Mail
Postoffice Diagnostics Utility (PODIAG.EXE) private profile, PODIAG.INI,
that are contained in the [Microsoft Mail PO Diagnostics] section.
<P>
The Microsoft Mail Postoffice Diagnostics Utility has two PODIAG.INI files
that both contain a section called [Microsoft Mail PO Diagnostics]. One of
the PODIAG.INI files exists in the MAILDATA\INI subdirectory; this .INI
file contains all of the postoffice-specific settings. The second
PODIAG.INI file exists in the WINDOWS subdirectory and contains environment-
specific information.
<P>
<P><h2>MAILDATA\INI\PODIAG.INI</h2>
 
<P>
The default settings of the [Microsoft Mail PO Diagnostics] section of the
postoffice-specific PODIAG.INI file are as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   [Microsoft Mail PO Diagnostics]
   LogFile=C:\MAIL32\MAILDATA\log\podiag.log
   LogViewer=notepad.exe
   LogTabs=Yes
   LogUsrDecisions=Yes
   AutoFix=No

</PRE><h3>LogFile=&lt;pathname&gt;</h3>
 
<P>
This is the path and filename of the diagnostics utility log file. The
default is PODIAG.LOG in the LOG directory of the postoffice database. This
setting is required.
<P>
<P><h3>LogViewer=&lt;pathname&gt;</h3>
 
<P>
This is the path and editor program used to view the log file. The default
is NOTEPAD.EXE. This setting is required. The Help file incorrectly lists
this setting as "LogView."
<P>
<P><h3>LogTabs=&lt;Yes/No&gt;</h3>
 
<P>
This specifies whether you want to use tabs or spaces to separate entries
in the log file. The default is Yes, to use tabs. This setting is required.
<P>
<P><h3>LogUsrDecisions=&lt;Yes/No&gt;</h3>
 
<P>
This specifies whether you want each decision you make to fix a problem or
cancel a check when running tools to be recorded in the log file. The
default is Yes, to record user choices. This setting is required.
<P>
<P><h3>AutoFix=&lt;Yes/No&gt;</h3>
 
<P>
This specifies whether you want the diagnostics utility to automatically
fix any database problems it encounters without prompting you for a
decision. The default is No, to not automatically fix problems without
prompting. This setting is required. Use this option only if you are sure
you do not want to be asked you whether you want to proceed to fix any
problems that are found.
<P>
<P><h3>Login=&lt;mailbox name&gt;</h3>
 
<P>
This is the administrator mailbox name used to sign in to the diagnostics
utility and open the postoffice specified with the Run command in Program
Manager. The default is "Admin." This setting is optional; if it is used,
you do not need to enter a user (mailbox) name in the Sign In dialog box.
To bypass the Sign In dialog box entirely, you also need to specify a
password with the Password setting. In addition, you must add the
"Dir=M:\MAILDATA" setting to the environment-specific WINDOWS\PODIAG.INI
file; otherwise, this setting will not work.
<P>
<P><h3>Password=&lt;password&gt;</h3>
 
<P>
This is the password of the administrator mailbox used to sign in to the
diagnostics utility and open the postoffice specified with the Run command
in Program Manager. The default is "Password." This setting is optional and
is used in conjunction with the administrator mailbox name; if it is used,
you do not need to enter a password in the Sign In dialog box. To bypass
the Sign In dialog box entirely, you also need to specify an administrator
mailbox with the Login setting. In addition, you must add the
"Dir=M:\MAILDATA" setting to the environment-specific WINDOWS\PODIAG.INI
file; otherwise, this setting will not work.
<P>
If you enter a password in the PODIAG.INI file in the INI subdirectory of
the postoffice, anyone can automatically sign in to that postoffice. For
security reasons, you should not enter the password in the PODIAG.INI file.
<P>
<P><h2>C:\WINDOWS\PODIAG.INI Settings</h2>
 
<P>
The default settings of the [Microsoft Mail PO Diagnostics] section of the
environment-specific PODIAG.INI file are as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   [Microsoft Mail PO Diagnostics]
   MostRecentlyUsed1=M:\MAILDATA
   MostRecentlyUsed2=
   MostRecentlyUsed3=
   MostRecentlyUsed4=

</PRE><h3>Dir=&lt;pathname&gt;</h3>
 
<P>
Use this command if you want to automatically access a specific postoffice
each time the utility is run on the workstation. An example of the proper
syntax is "Dir=M:\MAILDATA". This setting is not documented in the help
file but is required in order to use the "Login" and "Password" settings in
the postoffice=specific PODIAG.INI file.
<P>
MostRecentlyUsed1=&lt;pathname&gt;
MostRecentlyUsed2=&lt;pathname&gt;
MostRecentlyUsed3=&lt;pathname&gt;
<P><h3>MostRecentlyUsed4=&lt;pathname&gt;</h3>
 
<P>
These are the paths to the most recently accessed postoffices. This
information appears under the File menu and can be used to select a
postoffice to log in to with the PODIAG utility.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The PODIAG.INI file is created in the MAILDATA\INI subdirectory the first
time one of the PODIAG tools is run on the postoffice. In addition, an INI
subdirectory will be created if the INI subdirectory does not already exist
(as in the case of a version 2.1 postoffice). The environment-specific
PODIAG.INI file is created in the WINDOWS subdirectory the first time
PODIAG is run on a workstation.
<P>
The WINDOWS\PODIAG.INI file only contains one section called [Microsoft
Mail PO Diagnostics] and only contains the MostRecentlyUsed postoffice
settings.
<P>
There are five possible sections in the postoffice-specific PODIAG.INI:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail PO Diagnostics
<LI>Address &amp; Group Check
<LI>Directory Synchronization Check
<LI>Server Folder Check
<LI>User Mail Check
<P>
</UL>Each of the sections is created when the corresponding tool is run on the
postoffice. The one exception is the Microsoft Mail PO Diagnostics section,
which is created when the postoffice is closed. These sections can exist in
the postoffice-specific PODIAG.INI file, in any order.
