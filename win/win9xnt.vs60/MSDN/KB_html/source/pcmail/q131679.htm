</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Lack of memory is the most common cause of performance problems in computer
systems. When the memory requirements of the active processes exceed the
physical memory available on the system, the system starts paging (moving
portions of active processes to disk in order to reclaim physical memory).
At this point, performance decreases dramatically.
<P>
This article discusses memory usage and which Performance Monitor counters
are effective in detecting memory bottlenecks.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The single resource that consumes the most time during a task's execution
is that task's bottleneck. Bottlenecks can occur because resources are not
being used efficiently, resources are not being used fairly, or a resource
is too slow or too small.
<P>
A quick way to tell if a system is struggling for memory is to call up
WINMSD.EXE (located in %System Root%\system32) and look at the Memory
dialog. This utility details the total memory in the system, the current
available memory ready for allocation to applications started, available
space within the page file, and the Memory Load Index. The Memory Load
Index specifies a number between 0 and 100 that gives a general idea of
current memory utilization, in which 0 indicates no memory use and 100
indicates full memory use.
<P>
<P><h3>Using Performance Monitor</h3>
 
<P>
Performance Monitor is a graphical tool for measuring the performance of a
Windows NT based computer or other Windows NT based computers on a network.
<P>
It is located in the Administrative Tools group of both the Windows NT
Workstation and Windows NT Server products. On each computer, the behavior
of objects such as processors, memory, cache, threads, and processes can be
viewed. Each of these objects has an associated set of counters that
provide information on such things as device usage, queue lengths, and
delays, as well as information used for throughput and internal congestion
measurements. It provides charting, alerting, and reporting capabilities
that reflect current activity along with ongoing logging. Log files can be
opened later for browsing and charting to reflect current activity.
<P>
Before spending money to add more hardware or replace existing hardware, it
i s best to use Performance Monitor to first tune the system to make the
most efficient use of existing resources.
<P>
<P><h3>Memory - Pages/sec</h3>
 
<P>
Pages/sec is the number of pages read from the disk or written to the disk
to resolve memory references to pages that were not in memory at the time
of the reference. As a rule, assume that if the average of this counter is
consistently greater than five, then memory is probably becoming a
bottleneck in the system. Once this counter starts to average consistently
at 10 or above, performance is significantly degraded and disk thrashing is
probably occurring.
<P>
<P><h3>Memory - Available Bytes</h3>
 
<P>
Available Bytes displays the amount of free physical memory. If this
counter stays consistently below 1 MB on servers and 4 MB on workstations,
paging is occurring and performance is less than optimal.
<P>
<P><h3>Memory - Committed Bytes</h3>
 
<P>
Committed Bytes displays the size of virtual memory (in bytes) that have
been committed (as opposed to simply reserved). If this counter is greater
than the amount of main memory, it indicates that main memory may not be
large enough to accommodate all functions of all currently active processes
and some paging may be inevitable. However, before making such an
assumption, check Memory - Pages/sec and Memory - Page Faults/sec. If the
Memory - Pages/sec is greater than 10 (10 is a reasonable guideline, but
varies with disk hardware) and Memory - Page Faults/sec is greater than
Memory - Cache Faults/sec then there is too much paging.
<P>
When Memory - Committed bytes approaches the Memory - Commit Limit and the
page file has already reached maximum page file size, there are simply no
more pages available, in main memory or in the page file. The Memory -
Commit Limit is the amount of virtual memory that can be committed without
extending the page file. If this occurs on a server running Windows NT
Server, three errors in the Event Log may show up. (EVENTVWR.EXE is located
in the Administrative Tools group). They are from the source:
<P>
2020: The server was unable to allocate from the system paged pool
<PRE>      because the pool was empty.

</PRE>2001: The server was unable to perform an operation due to a shortage of
<PRE>      available resources.

</PRE>2016: The server was unable to allocate virtual memory.
<PRE>      NOTE: If this occurs, it is generally related to a memory leak in
      another process. To determine the process at fault, monitor
      each process's Page File bytes or Working Set.

      Another condition to be aware of is the following nonpaged pool
      error in the server's Event Log:

</PRE>2019: The server was unable to allocate from the system nonpaged pool
<PRE>      because the pool was empty.

      Nonpaged pool pages cannot be paged out to the paging file, but
      instead remain in main memory as long as they are allocated. By
      default, NonPagedPoolSize is dynamically calculated as follows:

</PRE>The system's nonpaged pool allocation can be monitored with the Memory Pool
Non Paged Bytes counter. If there is a shortage of nonpaged pool, the
following error may occur on a remote system or even the local system:
<P>
<PRE>   Not enough storage available to process this command.

</PRE>If this error occurs, start looking at each process's nonpaged pool
allocation. This is generally caused by an application incorrectly making
system calls and using up all allocated nonpaged pool.
<P>
<P><h3>Adding More Memory</h3>
 
To determine about how much memory to add, use the following formula:
<P>
<PRE>   Paging File - % Usage - MAX * Page file size = number of bytes used.
   Add together the bytes used for all page files.

</PRE>This is the amount of memory that would need to be added to allow all of
the applications to perform their operations with minimum paging. For
example, if a page file is 100 MB and the % Usage MAX is 20%, then add 20
MB additional
<P>
RAM to have a system that does minimal paging. The reason this formula only
gives an idea about how much memory to add is that a) not all page file "in
use" code is accessed all the time; and b) the formula ignores the
requirements for code and mapped files not backed by the paging file.
Therefore this estimate is neither an upper bound, nor a lower bound, it is
only an "indication." The truth is that there is no good way to know how
much memory to add at this time. A more accurate way to measure the amount
of memory an application would require is to run the application on a very
large machine and measure the needs under some slight memory pressure.
(There is a tool in the Windows NT Resource Kit volume 3 utilities called
Response Probe that can aid in this area.)
<P>
Adding memory without upgrading the secondary cache size sometimes degrades
processor performance. This is because the secondary cache now has to map
the larger memory space, usually resulting in lowered hit rates in the
cache. This slows down processor-bound programs because they are scattered
more widely in memory after memory has been added. (Secondary cache refers
to the physical cache memory chip(s) usually located on the motherboard, as
opposed to within the processor itself. In the future, processors will be
built with secondary cache on the same substrate as the processor chip, or
even within the processor chip itself.)
