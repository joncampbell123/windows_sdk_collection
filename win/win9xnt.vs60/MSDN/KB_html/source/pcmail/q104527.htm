The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 2.1, 3.0, 3.0a, 3.0b, and
   3.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In versions 2.1, 3.0, 3.0a, 3.0b, and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for PC
Networks, the Mail administrator does not have full privileges to
shared folders that users have created. Only the user who created the
folder can manipulate the rights to a shared folder.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To allow the administrator to obtain access to a shared folder, do one
of the following:

<UL><LI>The user can allow the administrator to know the password of the
   shared folder user's mailbox. The administrator can then log in as
   that user.

<LI>The administrator can run FIXIDX.EXE, a utility available through
   Application Note WA0641, "Database Maintenance Utilities," on the
   public folders and give the administrator the ownership of the
   folders. Note that running this program will result in the loss of
   all public folder names and the inability to access group folders
   that have been created.
<P>
   You can have this Application Note (WA0641) mailed or faxed to you
   by calling Microsoft Product Support Services Monday through
   Friday, 6:00 A.M. to 6:00 P.M. Pacific time at (206) 6337-9307. If
   you are outside the United States, contact the Microsoft subsidiary
   for your area. To locate your subsidiary, call Microsoft
   International Customer Service at (206) 936-8661.

<LI>Archive the shared folders of the particular user, create a shared
   folder in the Administrator program and then unarchive the archived
   folder into the new shared folder created by the Administrator
   program.
