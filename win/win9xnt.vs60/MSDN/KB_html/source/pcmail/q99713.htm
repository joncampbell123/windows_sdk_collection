</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Mail Gateway to SMTP saves the From field seen in the envelope
part (RFC-821) of an incoming message to use in case the Microsoft Mail
recipient wants to reply to the message.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Mail postoffice database has one From field. This causes the
SMTP gateway to choose one of the four possible SMTP From fields to save in
the postoffice database. The four possible From fields are explained in the
Background section below.
<P>
By default, the gateway saves the RFC-821 Mail From information in order to
ensure that non-delivery replies will always work properly. In most cases,
this information is the same as the RFC-822 From field. All four From
fields can be viewed in the SMTP gateway log file, SMTPGATE.LOG. You can
see the RFC-821 From field in the beginning of a message transmission, on
the line that begins:
<P>
<PRE>   [rx] MAIL From:...

</PRE>The RFC-822 From field is recorded later in the Header lines, and looks
like this:
<P>
<PRE>   Header: From:...

</PRE><h3>Background</h3>
 
<P>
SMTP From information is covered by two RFCs: RFC-821 and RFC-822. RFC-821
keeps From information in the Mail From field. This "gives the reverse-path
which can be used to report errors." (RFC-821 Section 3.1). RFC-822 has
From information in three fields:

<UL><LI>Sender: for "notices of any problems in transport or delivery....NEVER
   in a reply." (This field is only present if its contents are different
   from the From field below.)
<LI>Reply-To: for replies.
<LI>From: for replies if no Reply-To field exists. (RFC-822 Section 4.4.4)
<P>
</UL>The four From fields can be organized into two categories: those for
replies, and those for non-delivery notices, arranged in the order they
should be used.
<P>
For Replies:

<UL><LI>Reply-To
<LI>From
<P>
</UL>For Non-Delivery Notices:

<UL><LI>Sender
<LI>From
<LI>Mail From
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Version 3.0.9 of SMTPGATE.EXE adds a switch to give an SMTP gateway
administrator the choice of which From field to use. If you use the -F
switch, the gateway will save the From field in the RFC-822 headers, rather
than in the Mail From field. This means replies will always work properly.
However, a non-delivery notice might not work if the RFC-821 From field is
different from the RFC-822 From field.
<P>
The RFC-822 From field was chosen because if the Reply-To field is saved in
the From field, the recipient will never know who actually sent the mail.
To prevent misleading the recipient, you can use the -F switch to save the
From information.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be problem in version 3.0 of Microsoft Mail
Gateway to SMTP. This problem was corrected in version 3.0.9 of
SMTPGATE.EXE. If you do not have version 3.0.9 (or later), you can obtain
the latest version from the Microsoft Software Library (MSL). Download
