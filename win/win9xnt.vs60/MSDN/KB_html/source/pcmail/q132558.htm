The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail for Windows, version 3.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The Global Address List (GAL) and External Mail program postoffice
definitions may be missing when you search the address book of Microsoft
Mail for Windows. If this occurs, the only entry visible is the Personal
Address Book (PAB).
<P>
NOTE: The Windows client can receive messages and can send mail to
addresses in the PAB. The Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, MS-DOS
workstation is able to view all addresses and does not experience problems.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The addressing files are locked and unavailable to the Windows client. The
files are commonly the NETWORK.GLB or any numbered XTN file located in the
XTN sub-directory.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
The lock should be released and the address lists will become available
once the clients Exit and Sign Out and sign back into the Windows client.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The GAL will not be available to the address book if the GAL.NME file is
locked. This will not affect the External postoffice definitions. The
Admin, Import, and External programs update these files and are commonly
the process that can be causing the file to be unavailable.
<P>
If the network operating system is unable to locate a lock on any of these
files, attempt to make a copy of the file local, and edit the files with an
editor, such as Write, that will lock the file. If the file is locked by
another process, it will fail to open.
