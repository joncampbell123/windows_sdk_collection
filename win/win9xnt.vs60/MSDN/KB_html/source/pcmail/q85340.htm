The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail Gateway to FAX, version 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
The fax board used by the Microsoft Mail Gateway to Fax controls the
asynchronous connection and the communication with the remote fax
machine.
<P>
Faxes are placed in the fax board queue by the gateway. The board
dials and connects to the remote fax machine, and handles actual
transmission of the message. Any errors encountered by the fax board
are passed back to the gateway, usually identified by a "Communication
Error."
<P>
The fax board also accepts incoming calls from fax machines, receives
transmitted faxes, and passes the received messages to the gateway.
<P>
Fax boards should be tested before running the fax gateway by sending
and receiving faxes using the fax software that was shipped with the
board.
