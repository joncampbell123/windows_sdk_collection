<P>
Within the Admin program, you can define both direct and indirect gateways
to PROFS. Direct gateways are those that directly access your postoffice;
indirect gateways are connected to other "downstream" postoffices. Within
the mail client programs, both types of gateways appear in the PROFS
address list, and are not discernible from each other.
<P>
Normally, there is only one direct gateway installed at a postoffice;
however, there could be several indirect gateways defined. Mail addressed
to users on any of these indirect gateways is delivered to the host
by means of the External program and a downstream postoffice.
