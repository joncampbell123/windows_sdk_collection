2.10 3.00
MS-DOS
<P>
<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail Gateway to SMTP, versions 2.1 and 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Attachments of mail messages from the Microsoft Mail Gateway to SMTP
may appear as in the body of messages and seem corrupted. They may also
seem corrupted if you try to open them with their programs.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Attachments are coming in encoded in a format not supported by the SMTP
Gateway.
<P>
The SMTP Gateway supports the TEXT and UUENCODE formats of experimental
protocol RFC 1154 ONLY. The uuencode used is Sun's uuencode 5.
<P>
The SMTP Gateway does not support:

<UL><LI>uuencoded files sent using the hex format instead of uuencode
<LI>AppleSingle file format
<LI>AppleDouble file format
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Check with the message sender to ensure that attachments are uuencoded
in accordance to RFC 1154 section 4.7 and the uuencode format, or that
text attachments use the TEXT format.
<P>
If the sender is on a Macintosh, ensure that the gateway to SMTP uuencodes
the attachment and either uses MacBinaryII or strips off the resource fork
of the file before sending it out.
<P>
You can verify what encoding type is being received by looking at the
header lines of the incoming message in the log file (m:\log\smtpgate.log).
The encoding line will display the line count and format of all
attachments.
<P>
An example of encoding that the SMTP gateway can understand is below:
<P>
<PRE>   Header: Encoding: 2 TEXT, 1596 UUENCODE

</PRE>An example of encoding types the SMTP gateway does not understand is:
<P>
<PRE>   Header: Encoding: 2 TEXT, 391 HEX

</PRE>NOTE: The CC:Mail SMTP Gateway is configured by default to encode outgoing
SMTP attachments in uuencode format. Turning on the uuencode option with
the CC:Mail gateway turns on encoding using the hex format. Using the
option to uuencode the complete message encodes the body as well as the
attachment portion, rendering the message unreadable by MS Mail users, and
(probably) by users with accounts on the SMTP host.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Here are the definitions of text, hex, and uuencode formats from the
experimental protocol RFC 1154 specification:
<P>
4.1. Text
<P>
<PRE>   This indicates that the message is in no particular encoded format,
   but is to be presented to the user as is.

   The full range of the ASCII character set is used. The message is
   expected to consist of lines of reasonable length (less than 1000
   characters).

   On some transport services, only the 7-bit subset of ASCII can be
   used. Where full 8-bit transparency is available, the text is
   assumed to be ISO 8859-1 [3] (ASCII-8).

</PRE>4.3. Hex
<P>
<PRE>   The encoding indicates that the body part contains binary data,
   encoded as 2 hexadecimal digits per byte, highest significant nibble
   first.

   Lines consist of an even number of hexadecimal digits. Blank lines
   are not permitted. The decode process must accept lines with between
   2 and 1000 characters, inclusive.

</PRE>4.7. uuencode
<P>
<PRE>   The uuencode keyword specifies a section consisting of the output of
   the uuencode program supplied as part of UUCP.
