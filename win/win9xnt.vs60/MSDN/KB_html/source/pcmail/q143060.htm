<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
NOTE: Version 3.5 of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks Server is included with
the BackOffice CD version 1.5.
<P>
This article outlines the proper steps to install Microsoft Mail Server
version 3.5 from the compact disc. The installation documentation that
ships with the BackOffice CD is the same documentation for the retail Mail
product. This documentation assumes that you are installing from floppy
disk.
<P>
References in this article are made to the appropriate pages of the
documentation included with BackOffice version 1.5, if necessary.

<P><h3>How to Install Mail Server 3.5 from the BackOffice 1.5 CD</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Insert BackOffice CD 1 in the CD-ROM drive. From File Manager on the
   Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51, double-click SETUP.EXE,
   which is located at the root directory of the BackOffice CD 1.
<P>
   Notes:
<P>
   - If Windows NT Server version 3.51 software has not been
<P><PRE>     installed, refer to page 4 of the Windows NT Server "Installation
     Guide" included with BackOffice version 1.5.
</PRE><P>
   - Windows NT Server version 3.51 must be installed before Mail Server
<P><PRE>     can be setup from the BackOffice CD version 1.5.
</PRE>
<P><LI>At the Microsoft BackOffice 1.5 Installer dialog box, click Continue.

<P><LI>At the PreInstallation Information dialog box, click OK to continue.

<P><LI>At the Name and Organization Information dialog box, enter the
   following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Name:
      Company:
      Product ID:
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: The required product ID is located on the back of the
   BackOffice CD case.

<P><LI>At the Microsoft BackOffice 1.5 Installer dialog box, click the
   check box to select Mail Server 3.5, then click OK to continue.
<P>
   NOTE: For the check box to be available, the Windows NT machine that
   is installing Mail Server 3.5 must have Windows NT Server version
   3.51 installed. If this is not the case, the check box will not be
   available and the product, Mail Server, will be grayed out. This is
   also true for the other products on the BackOffice CD version 1.5.

<P><LI>At the Mail Server Dictionary Choices dialog box, select either the U.S.
   English or International English radio button, then click OK to
   continue.

<P><LI>At the Mail Installation dialog box, when you get the following prompt,
<P>
       Do you have an existing Microsoft Mail Postoffice?
<P>
    select the appropriate answer. If Yes is selected, then go to Step 8.
    If No is selected, then skip to Step 11.

<P><LI>At the Mail Installation dialog box, click the appropriate selection,
    either Server or Workgroup.

<P><LI>At the Microsoft BackOffice 1.5 Installer dialog box, remove CD 1 from
    the CD-ROM drive; then insert BackOffice CD 2, and click OK.

<P><LI>A command prompt will appear with the standard MS-DOS-based Mail setup
    (SETUP.EXE) procedures. Refer to Chapter 1 "Updating a Microsoft Mail
    Post Office" on page 11 of the Microsoft Mail for PC Networks
    "Administrator's Guide."
<P>
    If you upgraded a Workgroup PO, it will require you to serialize the
    postoffice. Go to step 13.
<P>
    If you are updating a existing Mail Server, go to step 14.

<P><LI>At the Microsoft BackOffice 1.5 Installer dialog box, remove the
    BackOffice disc 1 from the CD-ROM drive, then insert BackOffice CD 2,
    and click OK.

<P><LI>A command prompt will appear with the standard MS-DOS based-Mail setup
    (SETUP.EXE) procedures. In the Mail for PC Network "Administrator's
    Guide" refer to Chapter 1 "Setup and Update Procedures" on page 8,
    starting with step 3 to complete the Mail Setup.
<P>
    Once the normal MS-DOS based setup is complete a Mail Server
    Installation dialog box will appear.

<P><LI>At the Mail Server Installation dialog box, enter the path of the
    newly installed Mail Server. This path must contain a drive letter.
    For example, C:\MAILDATA. It is at this point that the postoffice is
    serialized. Click OK to continue.
<P>
    NOTE: If this step is not completed, the postoffice will maintain an
    invalid serial number of 799-99992. YOU MUST COMPLETE THIS STEP TO
    SERIALIZE THE POSTOFFICE.

<P><LI>At the Microsoft Mail 3.5 Multitasking MTA Setup dialog box, Setup
    will prompt you to install the Multitasking MTA for Windows NT
    Server (NT MMTA). If you would like to install this program, click
    Continue, and refer to Chapter 1 of the Multitasking MTA for Windows
    NT Server "Administrator's Guide." You will be prompted on screen for
    the appropriate information.
<P>
    If you do not want to install the NT MMTA, click Exit.

<P><LI>At the Microsoft Mail 3.5 Multitasking MTA Setup dialog box, click
    Exit one more time to return to the Microsoft BackOffice 1.5 Installer
    dialog box.

<P><LI>At the Microsoft BackOffice 1.5 Installer dialog box, click OK to
    complete the setup. Then click Close, and Yes to exit the Installer
   dialog box.
