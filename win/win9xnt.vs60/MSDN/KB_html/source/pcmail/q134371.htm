3.00.9
MS-DOS
kbother kbbug3.00.9
<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail Gateway to SMTP, version 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
During operation of the SMTP gateway, the available memory can unexpectedly
decrease, and eventually it will interfere with the ability of the gateway
to process mail.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Memory loss can occur if an incoming message contains two subject lines.
Memory allocated for the first subject is not released after processing the
message.
<P>
If you stop and restart the gateway, it will restore the free memory pool.
The -BR option can be used to stop the gateway after a designated period of
time.
<P>
For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../pcmail/q96126.htm">Q96126</A></B>
   TITLE     : SMTP: Error in Documentation for -BR Parameter

</PRE>NOTE: You can restart the gateway through a batch file that calls itself.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 3.0.9 of the
Microsoft Mail Gateway to SMTP. A fix for this problem is in development,
but has not been regression-tested and may be destabilizing in
production environments. Contact Microsoft Product Support Services for
more information on the availability of this fix.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Ordinarily a message will have only one subject, and when the second
subject occurs, the memory allocated for the first subject is not released.
The memory allocated for the subject is generally less than 40 bytes, but
the position of the memory can fragment the free memory pool and result in
failures when it attempts to allocate additional memory.
<P>
For additional information on how to observe the free memory during the
gateway operation, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:
