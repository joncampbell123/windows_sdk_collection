The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail Gateway to Fax, version 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
This article lists common problems you may encounter while installing the
Microsoft Mail Gateway to Fax.

<OL><P><LI>Installing the fax board.
<P>
   The fax board must be installed as indicated in the Microsoft Mail
   Gateway to Fax "Administrator's Guide." The most common problem
   encountered with the fax board is the board conflicting with another
   piece of hardware in the gateway machine. To avoid this problem, check
   the I/O addresses of the existing hardware in the gateway computer, and
   make sure the fax board does not conflict with any of these addresses.

<P><LI>Configuring the fax board software.
<P>
   The fax board software must be configured as indicated in the Microsoft
   Mail Gateway to Fax "Administrator's Guide." For example, the Intel
   SatisFAXtion software must be installed on the postoffice, and certain
   files must be copied to the gateway machine. If this is not done, the
   gateway will not work correctly.

<P><LI>Incorrect file types.
<P>
   The only allowable file types are black and white DCX and PCX files, and
   ASCII text files.

<P><LI>Microsoft Mail version 2.1a PROFILE.GLB file format.
<P>
   Because the version 2.1a profile file does not have its own editor,
   editing the PROFILE.GLB file can cause problems. Do not delete
   semicolons or comments from the file. The Printer path and Logo file
   parameters should be terminated with a backslash (\). If you encounter
   major problems, copy the original PROFILE.GLB from the install disks and
   modify it again.

<P><LI>Microsoft Mail version 3.0 PROFILE.GLB file format.
<P>
   In version 3.0 of the gateway, the Printer path and Logo file parameters
   do not need to be terminated with a backslash (\). You can edit the file
   using the PROFILE.EXE program; therefore, it should be relatively easy
   to modify.

<P><LI>Printer path.
<P>
   Entering the wrong parameters in the profile file can cause problems.
   Printer path is one of the more confusing parameters--it looks for a
   file called PPB.EXE, which should be in the mail executables directory.
   The path entered in this field should point to that file.

<P><LI>Logo file.
<P>
   This path should point to the logo file being used. This field cannot
   be left blank.

<P><LI>Unable to spool incoming faxes to printer.
<P>
   Before the fax gateway can spool items to the printer, the DISPLAY.EXE
   program must be run to create a printer driver. DISPLAY.EXE must be run
   from the same directory the fax gateway is run from.
