The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The advanced security feature provided by version 3.0 of Microsoft Mail for
PC Networks is designed for networks that support MS-DOS Interrupt 21,
Function 5F. Novell NetWare's shell (Netx or IPX) does not support this
call.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
You can work around this problem on a Microsoft Mail for MS-DOS Novell
NetWare workstation by using the following procedure:

<OL><P><LI>Create a batch file with the following commands:
<P>
<P><PRE>      @echo off
      cls
      ;Set search drive to mail executables:
      MAP INS S1:=server name/volume name:mail exe dir_name
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      ;Set drive mapping to mail database:
      MAP M: =server name/volume name:mail database dir_name
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      ;Start mail program:
      MAIL
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      ;Delete search drive to mail executable:
      MAP DEL S1:
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      ;Delete drive mapping to mail database:
      MAP DEL M:
</PRE>
<P><LI>Store the batch file in a public share subdirectory that is on your
   workstation's search path after logging in. Flag the batch file as
   RSH (read only, sharable, hidden) by using the following command:
<P>
<P><PRE>      flag &lt;filename&gt; rsh
</PRE>
<P><LI>Run the batch file. It will establish the proper drive mappings and
   start Microsoft Mail.
<P>
</OL>When you exit from Microsoft Mail, the batch program will delete the
drive mappings and return you to the MS-DOS prompt. Because the batch
file is flagged as read only and hidden, a user other than yourself,
working at your workstation, will not be able to access the file
unless he or she knows the filename. Even if he or she could access
the file, he or she cannot modify the batch file because you flagged
it as read only.
<P>
To prevent the user from shelling out to MS-DOS from within the MS-DOS
Mail client, you should disable this right when creating the user. For
information on how to do this, see page 96 of the Microsoft Mail
"Administrator's Guide."
<P>
As an additional option, you can place the command BREAK=OFF in the
workstation's CONFIG.SYS file. This will prevent someone from
terminating the batch file in the middle of execution after the drive
mappings have been established.
