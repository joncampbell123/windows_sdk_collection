The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail Gateway to 3Com 3+Mail, version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When using version 1.0 of the Microsoft Mail Gateway to 3Com 3+Mail, the
gateway may seem blocked: mail is not passed in either direction, yet the
gateway screen or error log shows no error messages related to this.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This may be a result of a message being stuck in the 3Com gateway
processing subdirectories.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Remove the stranded messages from the processing subdirectories before
restarting the gateway.
<P>
If you want to try to save the mail messages for later, back up the
following subdirectories with their files to a different location. Then
delete the message files and subdirectories in these locations:

<OL><P><LI>In the gateway-software subdirectory:
<P>
<P><PRE>      3C-OUT
      MFFPUT
      MFFGET
</PRE>
<P><LI>In the Microsoft Mail postoffice database directory:
<P>
<P><PRE>      P1
</PRE><P>
</OL>NOTE: Do NOT erase the POPULATE.MSM file or any currently dated message-
header files in the P1 directory. Remove only older files.
<P>
To get the gateway running, you need to clear all files out of these
directories and restart the gateway.
<P>
Later, you can try to resend the mail by copying the message files back
into the original directories.
<P>
If the problem persists, try the following:

<UL><LI>Use a faster PC for the gateway, such as a 386/25 or faster with a
   16-bit high speed network interface card.

<LI>Increase the interval between firing times from the default of 10
   minutes to 20 minutes.

<LI>Use the .INI parameter FIRETIME to selectively increase gateway
   throughput during peak times if needed.

<LI>Make sure you address mail to fewer than 99 users at any one time.

<LI>If you have large attachments to send, make sure the address list is
   small. You might have to send the mail multiple times to fit within the
   memory limits of the gateway.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft Mail Gateway
to 3Com 3+Mail, version 1.0. We are researching this problem and will post
new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
