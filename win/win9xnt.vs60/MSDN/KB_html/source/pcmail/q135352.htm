 2. Q. Is there a list of bug fixes included in version 3.5 of Mail
       for PC Networks?

    A. All files have been upgraded with version 3.5 of Microsoft
       Mail for PC Networks. A comprehensive list of all files
       upgraded due to fixes or otherwise revised is as follows:

       Client (version 3.5.2000.4086)

         MSMAIL.EXE
         MAPI.DLL
         MSSFS.DLL
         SCHEDMSG.DLL
         Microsoft Mail (Macintosh workstation)

       Server (version 3.5 for .EXE)

         ADMIN.EXE
         EXTERNAL.EXE
         ASYNC.OVL
         X25ATLAN.OVL
         X25EICON.OVL
         IMPORT.EXE
         REBUILD.EXE
         SRVMAIN.EXE

       For more information, see <B><A href="../pcmail/q132059.htm">Q132059</A></B>  Summary List of Mail for
       PC Networks 3.5 Bug Fixes  in the Microsoft Knowledge Base.

 3. Q. Will the MTA and MMTA run under Windows NT?

    A. Version 3.2x of the mail transfer agent (MTA) is designed
       and tested to run on an MS-DOS-based operating system.
       Version 3.2x of the Mail Multitasking MTA (MMTA) is designed
       and tested to run on OS/2 and 2.x operating system.

       The 3.2x MTA is not supported under any circumstances under
       Windows NT. The 3.2x MMTA is supported doing LAN-based
       transfers only under the Windows NT operating system. The
       MMTA is not supported doing asynchronous transfers because
       the MMTA must access hardware directly, and this is not
       possible under Windows NT.

       Transferring via X.25 is not supported either for the MMTA
       on Windows NT, as there was not an X.25 driver for Windows
       NT. Only version 3.5 of the Mail Multitasking MMTA for
       Windows NT is supported in an NT environment.

 4. Q. What is the purpose of inbox shadowing?

    A. The Inbox Shadowing feature instructs Mail for Windows to
       synchronize its inbox with the other Microsoft for PC
       Networks workstations  inboxes.

       For example, Mail marks each inbox message once as
       synchronized. When you delete a message from the Mail for
       Windows inbox, it will be deleted from the inbox for each
       other client.

       For more information, see <B><A href="../pcmail/q96718.htm">Q96718</A></B>, "Description and Use of
       Inbox Shadowing," in the Microsoft Knowledge Base.

 5. Q. What are the most commonly asked questions about MAPI?

    A. The questions most commonly asked about the Messaging
       Application Programming Interface (MAPI) can be found in
       <B><A href="../pcmail/q105959.htm">Q105959</A></B>, "MAPI Common Questions and Answers." The
       information in this article can help you understand what
       MAPI is and what it can do.

 6. Q. How can I perform maintenance on the Mail for PC Networks
       database?

    A. The application note titled "Database Maintenance Utilities,"
       WA0641, describes operational details for utilities used to repair
       and maintain the database for Microsoft Mail for PC Networks. The
       procedures described apply to versions 2.1 and later of Microsoft
       Mail except where noted.

       To obtain this application note in the United States,
       contact Microsoft Product Support Services.

 7. Q. What integrity or diagnostic tests can be run against my
       mail message file (MMF)?

    A. There are two utilities that you can run on the MMF:
       integrity check and compression.

       To run the integrity check:

       NOTE: Do not invoke the MMF integrity check unless you know
       your MMF is corrupt. There is a possibility, depending on
       the contents of an attachment, that the Mail client will
       improperly remove part or all of the attachment.

         Hold the SHIFT key down while you are entering Mail for
         Windows to check the integrity of the MMF.

       To run the compression:

         Hold the F5 key down while you are entering Mail for
         Windows to recover space occupied by deleted objects in
         the MMF.

       For more information, see <B><A href="../pcmail/q112265.htm">Q112265</A></B>, "Using F5 or SHIFT Key to
       Start Mail Utilities," in the Microsoft Knowledge Base.

 8. Q. I have run MOVEUSER.EXE, and now a number of users cannot
       access the mail server. What is the problem?

    A. This problem indicates that an ADMIN.EXE password recover
       has been executed on the user s mail message file (MMF)
       before you moved the user with MOVEUSER.EXE. As a result,
       the password was not carried over to the new mail server.

       For more information, see <B><A href="../pcmail/q117650.htm">Q117650</A></B>, "MOVEUSER.EXE Causes
       Invalid MMF After Password Reset," in the Microsoft
       Knowledge Base.

 9. Q. Is there a utility available that will allow me to perform
       housekeeping on server-based mail message files (MMFs)?

    A. Yes. Microsoft provides MMFCLEAN.EXE, a Windows-based
       application, to purge mail from MMFs.

       For more information, see <B><A href="../pcmail/q117693.htm">Q117693</A></B>, "Microsoft Mail
       MMFCLEAN.EXE Utility," in the Microsoft Knowledge Base.

10. Q. How can I optimize Mail connections via Remote Access
       Service (RAS)?

    A. Microsoft Mail for Windows is supported over RAS; although
       it will be much slower than if you access Mail directly over
       a network. (Version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows
       provides faster access.) If you need to use Mail for Windows
       over RAS, you should compose and read messages offline.

       For more information, see <B><A href="../pcmail/q119581.htm">Q119581</A></B>, "Using Mail Over RAS," in
       the Microsoft Knowledge Base.

11. Q. Why do I get the error "This account is not a valid user of
       this message file" when I log in to the Windows client?

    A. You will receive the error when the criteria contained in
       the Mail Message File (MMF) does not match your information
       on the postoffice. When this message is seen, it indicates
       that you are being properly validated by the postoffice, and
       the information returned from the postoffice does not match
       what is in the MMF.

       For more information, see <B><A href="../pcmail/q130096.htm">Q130096</A></B>, "Err Msg: This Account Is
       Not a Valid User of this...," in the Microsoft Knowledge
       Base.

12. Q. Can I have more than one Directory Synchronization (Dir-
       Sync) server within my organization?

    A. No. Requestors can be registered with only one Dir-Sync
       server. Also, the Dir-Sync server cannot be registered as a
       requestor with another Dir-Sync server.

       For more information about the Dir-Sync process, please
       refer to Application Note WA0725, Directory Synchronization
       (Dir-Sync), or see <B><A href="../pcmail/q96060.htm">Q96060</A></B>, "WA0725: Directory
       Synchronization (Dir-Sync)" in the Microsoft Knowledge Base.

13. Q. Can the MS-DOS Directory Synchronization (Dir-Sync) files be
       used on the OS/2 platform with the Multitasking MTA (MMTA)?

    A. Yes. The Dir-Sync files (IMPORT.EXE, NSDA.EXE, REBUILD.EXE,
       REQMAIN.EXE, and SRVMAIN.EXE) are  bound  applications. As a
       result, they can be run on multiple platforms, such as MS-
       DOS and OS/2.

       All Dir-Sync files, except DISPATCH.EXE, can be run in these
       environments.

14. Q. What is the MAIL.DAT file?

    A. The MAIL.DAT is a file created when Advanced Security is
       installed on the postoffice. This file contains the location
       of the postoffice data files. The file is encrypted so users
       cannot see the location of the data files; thus, they can
       not tamper with them.

       The MAIL.DAT file must reside in the Mail executable
       directory. If you remove the file, your postoffice no longer
       has the advanced security features, and users must establish
       a drive connection to the Maildata share to use the Mail
       program.

       For more information about the MAIL.DAT file, refer to
       Chapter 2 of the Mail for PC Networks "Administrator s
       Guide."

15. Q. How can two or more users run Microsoft Mail from one
       workstation?

    A. To run multiple Mail clients from the same workstation, make
       the MSMAIL.INI file read-only. As a result, each person who
       logs in to the workstation will have to enter his or her
       name and password information to access the Mail account.

16. Q. How can I create groups on one postoffice that span multiple
       postoffices?

       To set up this environment so that the least amount of
       maintenance is needed, do the following:

       1. Create a group on each postoffice titled, for example,

             All PO# Users

          where # is the postoffice number. Each group should
          contain ALL local users, but NO external users.

       2. Export the updated address lists among all the
          postoffices (or let the directory synchronization (Dir-
          Sync) cycle complete).

          NOTE: If a group only contains users on the local
          postoffice, it can participate in Dir-Sync.

       3. After the Dir-Sync cycle is complete, from the
          Administrator program on each postoffice, merge the group
          names from the other postoffices into the local
          postoffice address list (POL) using the Address, Create
          command.

       4. Create a group on EACH postoffice, for example,

             All Users at ABC Company

          The group should contain all local users (the same users
          as in step 1 above) AND the All PO# Users group names
          from the other postoffices.

          Notes:

           - Once the groups in step 4 have been created, you should
             not export the address list again. Doing so will create
             duplicate group names on the Global Address List (GAL).

           - Because this group will contain two external addresses,
             it will not participate in Dir-Sync.

       For more information on automating groups, see <B><A href="../pcmail/q103379.htm">Q103379</A></B>,  How
       to Create Groups Spanning Multiple Postoffices  and <B><A href="../pcmail/q124044.htm">Q124044</A></B>
        Replicating Postoffice Address List Groups Between POs  in
       the Microsoft Knowledge Base.

17. Q. How can I create group folders from Mail for Windows?

    A. Group folders cannot be created in the Windows client. They
       must be created in the Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, MS-
       DOS workstation in order for the Windows client to use them.

18. Q. My Directory Synchronization (Dir-Sync) cycle is one hour
       off the week before Daylight Saving Time begins. How can I
       correct this?

    A. The PROCESS.GLB is not Daylight Saving Time (DST) aware, but
       the Dispatch process is. As a result, when Dispatch queries
       the PROCESS.GLB schedule table, it calculates each process
       up to a week (604,800 seconds) in advance. The week before
       DST, Dispatch interprets the table as one week plus one hour
       different; however the difference is not noted in the
       PROCESS.GLB schedule.

       To correct this, either re-adjust the times in the
       Administrator s program (ADMIN.EXE) to update the
       PROCESS.GLB file, or use the TimeZone (-TZ) variable on the
       External command line.

       For more information, see <B><A href="../pcmail/q101753.htm">Q101753</A></B>  When to Use the Time Zone
       Option with Dir-Sync  in the Microsoft Knowledge Base.

19. Q. How do I configure Mail when a shared version of Microsoft
       Windows is installed on my network server?

    A. The information in the Microsoft Knowledge Base article
       <B><A href="../pcmail/q107444.htm">Q107444</A></B>  Running Windows Client from the Network  outlines
       the procedures for users to run Mail for Windows from the
       network without storing Mail files on their local
       workstations.

       The following procedures are outlined in the article so that
       the network administrator can set up Mail so users can run
       Mail for Windows from the network without storing Mail files
       on their local workstations.

        - "Running Windows and Mail from the Network--Same Directory"
          explains how to set up Mail for Windows when users run both
          Microsoft Windows and version 3.2a of Mail for Windows
          from the same network directory.

        - "Running Windows and Mail from the Network--Different
           Directories" explains how to set up Mail for Windows when
           users run both Windows and Mail for Windows from different
           network directories.

        - "Running Windows Locally and Mail from the Network"
           explains how to set up Mail for Windows when users run
           Windows locally and run Mail for Windows from the network.

        - "Running Windows from the Network and Mail Locally"
           explains how to set up Mail for Windows when users run
           Windows from the network and run Mail for Windows locally.

20. Q. What are the differences between the Windows for Workgroups
       version of Mail and retail Mail?

    A. The Workgroups Mail postoffice architecture is similar to
       the architecture for Microsoft Mail for PC Networks. This is
       so users with connectivity needs beyond their workgroup can
       easily upgrade.

       The postoffice structure and Windows client are identical
       except for the following:

        - No Demo files are in the workgroup postoffice. Microsoft
          Mail for PC Networks does include these files.
        - No spell checker is supplied with Microsoft Mail for PC
          Networks.
        - The postoffice in Windows for Workgroups does not support
          connections to external postoffices or gateways. For
          example, a Windows for Workgroups postoffice cannot connect
          to another postoffice or gateway.
        - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks includes support for
          global aliases or network group names while Windows for
          Workgroups Mail does not.
        - The default ADMIN.TPL and ADMIN.INF files in Windows for
          Workgroups Mail are created with predefined user information
          in the workgroup postoffice. For example, the user templates
          included in Windows for Workgroups Mail contain template
          information regarding Phone number #1, Phone number #2, Office,
          Department, and Notes. These must be created separately in
          Microsoft Mail for PC Networks.
        - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks includes an administration
          program not created in Windows for Workgroups Mail. In Windows
          for Workgroups, the administration program is accessed via
          the Mail menu in the Windows Mail client.
        - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks includes an administration
          utility that is used to administer and configure the postoffice.
          The ADMIN.EXE program can be used to configure and administer
          the postoffice from any workstation on the network running
          MS-DOS. In Windows for Workgroups, the administration program
          is accessed via the Mail menu in the Windows Mail client. Only
          the administrator can log on under his or her account and
          administer the postoffice on the workstation only.
        - The Mail client included with Microsoft Windows for Workgroups
