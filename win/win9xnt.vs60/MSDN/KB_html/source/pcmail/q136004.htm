The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.5
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The file locking timing method used when you run multiple External Mail
programs against asynchronously connected postoffices (POs) with two way
connection enabled can result in inaccurate nondelivery reports (NDRs) or
possible duplicate mail.
<P>
The above problem can have the following symptoms:

<UL><LI>Misleading NDRs and SYSTEM.LOG entries:
<P><PRE>      External program has detected a mail problem.
      Message data:
<PRE></PRE>        From: /USERONE
        Date: 07-06-95
        Time: 09:01
        Subject: RE: Testing
      [005] Mail retry count exceeded sending to:  MAILNET  /MAILPO
      [016] Message was not sent due to missing message file.
      Missing file is O:MAI\MA4\0006A044.MAI.

   However, the SENT.LOG file shows that the message was successfully
   delivered prior to this attempt.

</PRE><LI>Messages are received a second time with only the subject line.

<LI>Duplicate messages.
<P>
</UL>With the original file locking method, after sending mail, the MBG .OLK
file was deleted before the ATT, MAI, and other associated P1 files were
deleted. As a result, the MBG file would be unlocked too quickly. Another
External Mail program may attempt to lock the mailbag and process the mail
before the previous External Mail program had cleaned up properly,
resulting in the above errors.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
IMPORTANT: Only upgrade to this version if you are experiencing the above
problem.
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 3.5 of Microsoft
Mail for PC Networks. This problem was corrected in EXTERNAL.EXE version
3.5.20.
<P>
To obtain this updated file, please contact your Microsoft Technical
Account Manager (TAM) or Product Support Services (PSS).
