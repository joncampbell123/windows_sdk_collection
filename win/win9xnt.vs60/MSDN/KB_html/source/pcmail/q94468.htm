The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail Gateway to MHS, version 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Netware Global Messaging (NGM) is the update Novell has released to MHS
1.5. Even though NGM handles messages in a manner similar to MHS, the
procedure to install the Gateway is different.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
All gateways that support the Simple Message Format (SMF) 70 Specification
are compatible with NGM. The Microsoft Mail Gateway to MHS version 3.0 was
written to this specification. However, because NGM was released after the
gateway, the information in this article was not subject to the normal pre-
release testing and beta cycle procedures which were in place for MHS 1.5.
<P>
Chapter 8 of the NGM Administration Manual, titled "SMF Gateways, Non-
Participating, Passive, and Indirectly Accessed Servers," deals with
installing gateways such as the Microsoft Mail Gateway to MHS, version 3.0.
To install the gateway, follow the procedure on page 8-22 titled
"Establishing Connectivity with Indirectly-Accessible Messaging Servers."
<P>
Note the section on GWDEMON, a separate component that must run on a
workstation to support a gateway. GWDEMON is required by any gateway that
uses the inpost, outpost method to submit messages to MHS. GWDEMON acts
similarly to the Connectivity Manager in MHS 1.5. Page 8-24 of the NGM
Administration Manual describes the GWDEMON application.
<P>
In the process of defining the SMF Gateway in the New SMF Gateway
Information form (documented on page 8-25 of the NGM manual), the following
fields are equivalent to those in MHS 1.5:

<UL><LI>Gateway NGM Short Name: an 8 letter address, equivalent to the
   gateway Host Name in MHS 1.5

<LI>Command Line: accepts the command line switches documented on page
   19 of the "Microsoft Mail Gateway to MHS Administrator's Guide" for
   version 3.0.

<LI>SMF Version: Must contain the value 70.
<P>
</UL>After completing this information, the installation program creates a new
set of directories in the MHS\MAIL\GATES\&lt;GATENAME&gt; directory, where
&lt;GATENAME&gt; is replaced by the gateway host name. This directory contains
five subdirectories, as follows:
<P>
<PRE>IN      Holds messages from Microsoft Mail to NGM

OUT     Holds messages from NGM to Microsoft Mail

</PRE>IPARCEL Holds attachment files that correspond to messages in the IN
<PRE>        subdirectory

</PRE>OPARCEL Holds attachment files that correspond to messages in the OUT
<PRE>        subdirectory

</PRE>PUBLIC  Holds the executable files (put INPOST.EXE and OUTPOST.EXE
<PRE>        here)

</PRE>After these directories are available, run GWDEMON and Microsoft Mail can
communicate with NGM.
