The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Electronic Forms Designer, version 1.0, running with
   Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you send a message using the Routing form included with Electronics
Form Designer, the serialized routing of the file may not be completed.
This occurs if one of the recipients in the Routing form is not an E-form
client. This can include MS-DOS, Macintosh, and Windows clients that do not
have the E-form software installed.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
In the Routing form message, the routing information is stored in an MEF
package and can only be read and interpreted by an E-form client. Mail
clients that do not have the E-form software installed receive a text-only
version of the message and can not access the MEF package (MEFPKG.DAT).
Since the next recipient in the routing list cannot be determined, the
routing cycle is terminated.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 1.0 of Electronic
Forms Designer. We are researching this problem and will post new
information in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
