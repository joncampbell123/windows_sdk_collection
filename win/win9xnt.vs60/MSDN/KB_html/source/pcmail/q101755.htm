The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0b and 3.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
You can recover your Personal Address Book (PAB) from an exported MMF
file in versions 3.0b and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows.
<P>
If you exported a folder by choosing Export Folder from the File menu,
you can  recover the messages and folders, as well as the PAB, from
the exported MMF file. Recovering the PAB requires a different
procedure than the Import Folders procedure; you must exchange the
MMF that contains the desired PAB for the MMF that is in use.
<P>
For this example, assume the exported MMF file is named EXPORT.MMF,
the new MMF file that is created when you start Mail for Windows is
named NEW.MMF, and the MMF that is in use as the current MMF is named
MSMAIL.MMF. To recover the PAB, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Move the current MMF file to the local hard drive by choosing
   Options from the Mail menu, then click the gray Server button. A
   dialog box will open that allows you to enter a path and filename
   for the relocation of the MMF file. Use the name MSMAIL.MMF. Choose
   the Local option button and then choose OK.

<P><LI>Save the current MMF file's messages and folders. From the File
   menu, choose Export Folders. Export all of the folders to a file
   named TEMP.MMF, then Exit Mail.

<P><LI>Rename the current MMF file, which is located in the directory
   specified in step 1, from MSMAIL.MMF to any unique name.

<P><LI>Rename the EXPORT.MMF file to MSMAIL.MMF (the name used to move the
   MMF to your local hard drive). This new MSMAIL.MMF contains the old
   messages and the old PAB.

<P><LI>Restart the Mail program. As the program starts, it will display a
   dialog box stating that the MMF file it found is a backup MMF file
   and will ask if you want to make the file the primary MMF. Choose
   Yes.

<P><LI>Import the new folders and messages from the TEMP.MMF file. From
   the File menu, choose Import Folders. In the Import Folders dialog
   box, type TEMP.MMF. Mail will now import all the messages and
   folders.
<P>
</OL>The PAB will be restored automatically when the folders are imported.
You can now restore the MMF back to the server.
