The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.2 and 3.5
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you receive a message with a very large recipient list, you will not
be able to download new mail, and the broken network icon will appear in
the lower right corner of the Mail client.
<P>
After you try to download the message several times, you will get the
following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Mail cannot send or receive messages because of problems downloading a
   message.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The size of the To: list has exceeded the limit of the client. The message
cannot be moved to the mail message file (.MMF) because of the size of the
To: list.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To restore the client to normal operation, sign into your Mail account with
the Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, MS-DOS workstation and delete the
message.
<P>
Another workaround, with the assistance of Microsoft Product Support, is to
delete the .MAI file associated with the message from the shared file
system database.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 3.5 of the
Microsoft Mail for Windows. A fix for this problem is in development, but
has not been regression-tested and may be destabilizing in production
environments.
<P>
Contact Microsoft Product Support Services for more information on the
availability of this fix.
