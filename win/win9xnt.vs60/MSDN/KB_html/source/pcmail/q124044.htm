The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 2.1, 3.0, and 3.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how the Microsoft Mail Group Import program,
GIMPORT.EXE, can be used to automate the process of creating Mail
Postoffice Address List Groups. These groups can contain local postoffice
users, external postoffice users, and certain gateway users.
<P>
GIMPORT.EXE is available as part of the Application Note titled, "Database
Maintenance Utilities," WA0641. This Application Note describes operational
details for utilities used to repair and maintain the database for
Microsoft Mail for PC Networks. The procedures described apply to versions
2.1 and later of Microsoft Mail except where noted.
<P>
To obtain this Application Note in the United States, call Microsoft
Product Support Services at (206) 635-7022 or (900) 555-2100. Outside the
United States, contact the Microsoft subsidiary for your area. To locate
your subsidiary, call Microsoft International Customer Service at
(206) 936-8661.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
GIMPORT.EXE can create groups based on information in an input text file.
The format of this input file is very similar to that used with the
IMPORT.EXE program that ships with Microsoft Mail. For more information on
the format of this file, please refer to the documentation on GIMPORT.EXE
available with the Application Note. The GIMPORT.EXE input file can be
created manually or can be automatically created by the GIMPORT.EXE program
by extracting the group information from a Microsoft Mail postoffice.
<P>
The following steps show how groups created by Mail Administrator can be
replicated into other Mail postoffices. This is especially useful when
trying to create groups spanning multiple postoffices. The example used in
the steps shows how to create groups on postoffice A and replicate them to
postoffice B. (Postoffice A is on drive M, and postoffice B is on drive N.)
<P>
NOTE: Before proceeding, it is recommended that you read the information on
GIMPORT.EXE available in Application Note WA0641.

<OL><P><LI>Create the groups for postoffice A you wish to replicate to postoffice
   B. From Mail Administrator, select Local-Admin, Group, Create. Select
   the users you wish to add to the group and enter the group name and
   group address.
<P>
   NOTE: To add external postoffice or gateway users to a group, you need
   to first add these users to the postoffice Address List by selecting
   Address, Create.

<P><LI>Use GIMPORT.EXE to extract the group information. Type the following
   command at the MS-DOS prompt
<P>
<P><PRE>      gimport -dm &lt;admin&gt; -p&lt;password&gt; -f&lt;groups.ext&gt; -x -i&lt;grpusers.dat&gt;
</PRE><P>
   where:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - &lt;admin&gt; is a Microsoft Mail mailbox with administrative privileges on
      postoffice A.
    - &lt;password&gt; is the password for the &lt;admin&gt; account.
    - &lt;groups.ext&gt; is the name of a text file that will be created by the
      GIMPORT.EXE program containing the group information.
    - &lt;grpusers.dat&gt; is the name of a file that will contain only the names
      of the members of all the groups extracted. This file is for use with
      the IMPORT.EXE program.
</PRE><P>
   In case you wish to extract information for only certain groups, replace
   the -X in the above command with -X&lt;GRPNAMES.INP&gt; where &lt;GRPNAMES.INP&gt;
   is a text file that contains the full (friendly) names of the groups you
   wish to extract. You must create this file yourself and place each name
   you want included on a separate line.

<P><LI>To replicate the users in the groups extracted from postoffice A to the
   Postoffice Address List on postoffice B, type the following command at
   an MS-DOS prompt
<P>
<P><PRE>      import -dn &lt;admin&gt; -p&lt;password&gt; -f&lt;grpusers.dat&gt; -a
</PRE><P>
   where:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - &lt;admin&gt; is a Microsoft Mail mailbox with administrative privileges on
      postoffice B.
    - &lt;password&gt; is the password for the &lt;admin&gt; account.
    - &lt;grpusers.dat&gt; is the file created in Step 2.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Replicate the groups into postoffice B by typing the following command
   at an MS-DOS prompt.
<P>
<P><PRE>      gimport -dn &lt;admin&gt; -p&lt;password&gt; -f&lt;groups.ext&gt;
</PRE><P>
</OL>The groups created on postoffice A should now be available in the
Postoffice Address List on postoffice B. The groups will not be visible in
the Global Address List until after the REBUILD.EXE program is run. If you
have automatic Directory Synchronization configured, REBUILD.EXE will be
automatically run the next time your directories are synchronized.
