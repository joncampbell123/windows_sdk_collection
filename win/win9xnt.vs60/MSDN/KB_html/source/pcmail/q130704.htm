<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Windows for Workgroups Mail, when you select the menu Mail and change
password, a dialog box is displayed with a check box "remember password".
This article describes this feature and its usage.
<P>
On changing the password and checking this box, you are not prompted
for your password in subsequent sessions. However, after doing this if
you change your mind and want to be prompted to enter the password on
loading mail, how do you revert back ?
<P>
If you try changing the password and leave the box clear (not selected), on
loading mail the following error message appears:
<P>
<PRE>   Mailbox name or password is incorrect

</PRE>On pressing enter, the 'sign in' dialog box is displayed and the
password field displays asterisks denoting the length of the previous
password.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this issue it is important to understand that the 'Remember
Password' option is actually a MS Windows for Workgroups feature that is
not provided with the MS Mail 3.2 Windows Client.
<P>
But if you are using the MS Mail 3.2 Windows Client in the MS Windows
for Workgroups environment, then you will have this option available
if the WFWG mail components are in use.  Specifically, the WFWG
version of the MSSFS.DLL file has been enhanced to tie into the WFWG
password caching scheme.
<P>
Here are four procedures that may be used to resolve this issue:

<OL><P><LI>Replace the WFWG MSSFS.DLL with the Mail 3.2 MSSFS.DLL
</OL>2. Delete the user's password caching file &lt;username&gt;.PWL
3. Use the WFWG 3.11 Resource Kit Password List Editor to edit
<PRE>     the PWL file and remove the cached password for Mail.
</PRE></OL>4. Write a null password for Mail in the PWL file.
<P>
Here are the procedures in more detail:

<OL><P><LI>If the MS Mail 3.2 Windows Client is being used in the MS Windows
   for Workgroups environment and the 'Remember Password' option is not
   desired the WFWG version of MSSFS.DLL (c:\windows\system\mssfs.dll
   dated 11/1/93) can be replaced with the MS Mail 3.2 Windows Client
   version of the MSSFS.DLL file.
   The 'Remember Password' option will no longer appear in the logon
   dialog or the change password dialog in the MS Mail 3.2 Client.

<P><LI>MS Windows for Workgroups caching scheme stores passwords in a
   file on the hard disk.  The naming convention for the file is
   &lt;username&gt;.pwl and the file is typically stored in the c:\windows
   directory.  If this file is removed from the hard disk the user will
   be prompted for a password when attempting to access any resources
   using passwords that were previously cached in the PWL file.
<P>
   If the user desires to continue caching passwords with some resources,
   then the user will need to provide the password when connecting to
   these resources and once again select the 'Remember Password' or 'Save
   this Password in Your Password List' option to have the passwords
   written to a new PWL file.

<P><LI>The MS Windows for Workgroups 3.11 Resource Kit provides a
<PRE>   'Password List Editor' utility that allows a network administrator or
   user to remove password caching for specific resources contained in a
   PWL file.

   This utility does not display the passwords (which are encrypted) in the
   file, but will display specific resources (shares, mail) which can be
   removed from the PWL file.

   This option enables an administrator/user to disable password caching
   for a specific resources and does not require the user to recreate the
   PWL file for other resources where password caching is still desired.

</PRE><P><LI>If the administrator/user does not have access to the WFWG 3.11
   Resource Kit then a null password can be written to the PWL file for
   Mail and this will disable password caching for Mail.
<P>
   The WFWG password caching feature does not work with Mail when a null
   (blank) password is written to the PWL file.  If a null password is
   written to the PWL file (by changing the Mail password to null and
   then selecting the 'Remember Password' option) the Sign In dialog is
   displayed anyway. (Pressing the return key will take the user into
   Mail.)
<P>
   Once this is done the user can change their password back to a non-null
   password and not select the 'Remember Password' option.  This will
   update the MMF file to the new non-null password but leave the null
   password in the PWL file.  The result is that the user will always be
   prompted for a password (even though a null password is still in the
   PWL file) until they once again choose the 'Remember Password' option
   while using the new non-null password.
   This procedure, like procedure number 1 and 3 above, also does not
   require recreating the PWL file for continued caching of other
   resources.
<P>
</OL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To insure proper implementation of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks Windows
Client on a Windows for Workgroups workstation,it is important to have the
most updated versions of the Mail 3.2 DLL's. There is an updated SETUP.INF
file available in WSETUP.EXE that can be download from the MSDL and used to
ensure that the correct DLL's are actually copied to the local WINDOWS and
MAIL directories. See <B><A href="../pcmail/q124953.htm">Q124953</A></B> for more information.
