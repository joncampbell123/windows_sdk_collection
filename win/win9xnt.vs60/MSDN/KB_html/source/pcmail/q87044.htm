<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail Gateway to SMTP, version 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
A gateway, when used in conjunction with electronic mail systems, is
designed to connect two or more dissimilar mail systems. For example,
a gateway that links dissimilar mail systems A and B, sends and receives
messages from each mail system using the protocols associated it.
<P>
The gateway changes all the protocols necessary between the two mail
systems, but it does not change the actual data being sent: what you send
is what is received by the destination mail system.
<P>
A gateway cannot always provide every service requested by a mail system
because it is limited by the services available at the other mail system.
For example, one mail system may support registered mail. When it sends a
registered mail message through the gateway to another mail system, that
receiving mail system must be able support registered mail. If it does
not, registered mail cannot be used when communicating with this mail
system.
