The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2
</UL> 
<P>
This article lists and explains all the entries in the Microsoft Mail
for Windows private profile, MSMAIL.INI, that are contained in the
[Providers] section.
<P>
[Providers]
<P>
<P><h3>Logon=&lt;DLL name&gt;</h3>
 
<P>
This entry identifies a single DLL that contains the logon and session
management code for your mail system. It is often, but not
necessarily, the same as the Transport and Name entries. You should
enter the base name of the DLL, without the .DLL extension. You may
prefix a path if the DLL is not in a directory on your MS-DOS path or
in the Mail executable directory.
<P>
The default value is MSSFS.
<P>
<P><h3>Name=&lt;DLL names&gt;</h3>
 
<P>
This entry identifies one or more DLLs that contain functions required
to browse system and personal user lists. One of the values is often,
but not necessarily, the same as the Logon and Transport entries. You
should enter base names of the DLLs, separated by blanks, without the
.DLL extension. You may prefix a path if the DLLs are not in a
directory on your MS-DOS path or in the Mail executable directory.
<P>
The order of providers in this entry is significant. When Mail
resolves ambiguous names typed into a message, if it finds an exact
match in the first provider in the list, it will not go on to query
the rest. Placing the personal address book provider first can save
time in that process.
<P>
The default value is MSSFS PABNSP.
<P>
<P><h3>SharedFolders=&lt;DLL name&gt;</h3>
 
<P>
This entry identifies a single DLL that contains functions required to
read and write messages in Microsoft PC Mail shared folders. It is
unlikely that any DLL other than MSSFS will have this functionality.
<P>
The default value is MSSFS.
<P>
<P><h3>Transport=&lt;DLL name&gt;</h3>
 
<P>
This entry identifies a single DLL that contains the functions
necessary to send and receive mail on your mail system. It is often,
but not necessarily, the same as the Logon and Name entries. You
should enter the base name of the DLL, without the .DLL extension. You
may prefix a path if the DLL is not in a directory on your MS-DOS path
or in the Mail executable directory.
<P>
The default value is MSSFS.
