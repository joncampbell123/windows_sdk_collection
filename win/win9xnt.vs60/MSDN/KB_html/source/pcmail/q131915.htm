<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.2 and 3.2a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In versions 3.2 and 3.2a of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, when you use
the EXTERNAL.EXE program to connect dynamically to a Novell server, and
that server is the Novell server that validates the user account on your
network, the server will not disconnect the session that EXTERNAL.EXE
creates.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The workstation that runs EXTERNAL.EXE connects to the Novell network, and
the workstation shell then sends out a NetWare Core Protocol Language (NCP)
request for an active Novell server to validate the user account.
<P>
When a server responds, the shell establishes a Not Logged In connection on
that server. If EXTERNAL.EXE dynamically connects to the server to deliver
messages to a postoffice there, the connection changes to the account name
used by the workstation. When EXTERNAL.EXE subsequently dynamically
disconnects from the server, the connection at the workstation is
terminated (the drive letter used by EXTERNAL.EXE is unmapped) but the
server keeps the connection open with the account name, not Not Logged In.
<P>
This is normal behavior for Novell, because the server must maintain a
connection in order to continue to validate the user account.
<P>
NOTE: The shell and Novell NetWare communicate using a language called
NetWare Core Protocol (NCP). NCP is used for all client requests for
service and for the responses to those requests. NCP is the single most
important application layer protocol that NetWare provides. Without NCP,
none of the file services offered by NetWare would be possible.
