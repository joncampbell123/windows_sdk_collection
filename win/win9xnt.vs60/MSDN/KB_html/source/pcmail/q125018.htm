The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail for Windows, version 3.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Double-clicking on a user or group on the To: or Cc: lines of a Read Note
or form does not provide details of the user or group, only the friendly
name and address.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 3.2 of Microsoft
Mail for Windows. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you double-click on a user or group on the To: or Cc: lines of a Read
Note or form, a Resolved Name Details dialog box appears with the friendly
name and address of the user or group. This behavior is different from the
Compose Note.
<P>
When the resolved name of a user is double-clicked in a Compose Note,
template information about that user is displayed. When the resolved name
of a group is double-clicked in a Compose Note, a dialog box containing the
group alias and group members appear. This behavior is similar to the
Details button in the Address dialog box.
