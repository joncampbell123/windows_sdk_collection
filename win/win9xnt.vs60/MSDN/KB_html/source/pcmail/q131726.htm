The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.2 and 3.2a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Mail for Windows, you may not be able to retrieve a message
that was sent from Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks that has a large
number of individual recipients on the To: line. If this occurs, you may
get the following error:
<P>
<PRE>   There are too many entries selected to complete the operation.
   Please select fewer entries.

</PRE>The mail spooler will fail to pull this message into the mail message file
(MMF). The affected users will get the disconnected network icon, and the
Windows client will stop receiving mail.
<P>
NOTE: You will be able to read the same message in Microsoft Mail for PC
Networks, MS-DOS workstation.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The above error will occur when a large number of recipients are selected
to be included on the To: line when you compose a message. However, the
Mail for AppleTalk Networks client does not have this limitation.
<P>
When the message arrives, the Windows client treats it as if it is a
corrupt message.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
You will have to sign into Mail using the MS-DOS client, and delete the
"stuck" message.
<P>
Users should use groups when sending mail to large number of recipients.
This will improve mail efficiency, as well.
