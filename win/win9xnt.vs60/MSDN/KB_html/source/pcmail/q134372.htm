The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail Gateway to IBM PROFS and OfficeVision, versions 3.0
   and 3.2
<LI>Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
PROFS and OfficeVision do not include Reply All functionality when you
respond to messages. Due to this limitation in the PROFS and OfficeVision
product, the Microsoft Mail Gateway to IBM PROFS and OfficeVision does not
support this feature.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you address messages in Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, you can add
multiple recipients to the To: and Cc: lines. This allows you to send one
message to more than one person. When the recipient of the message receives
the mail, they have the option to reply to the sender via the Reply command
in Microsoft Mail. Additionally, the recipient can reply to both the sender
and all other recipients by using the Reply All feature.
<P>
The Reply All functionality works with mail messages exchanged between
Microsoft Mail users and most gateways to foreign mail systems. The Reply
All feature is not available to PROFS and OfficeVision users because PROFS
and OfficeVision addressing information is maintained in the message header
only for a single recipient. Other users entered on the To: line and Cc:
line are not maintained in the message header. They appear only in the
textual body of the message.
<P>
NOTE: This is no different than PROFS and OfficeVision functionality. PROFS
and OfficeVision create an individual message for each recipient addressing
each message to a single recipient. Only the single recipient is included
in the message header with additional recipients placed in the textual body
of the mail message.
