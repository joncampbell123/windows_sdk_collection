The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.2 and 3.5
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In version 3.x of Mail for PC Networks, you can send attachments with your
mail messages. Both Microsoft Windows NT and Microsoft Windows 95 support
Long File Names (LFN). However, Mail 3.x does not support LFN.
<P>
You can still send attachments; however, the filename will be truncated.
For example, the attachment named Longfilenames.dos will become
Longfi~1.dos.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Below is a table that shows the support of LFN between clients.
<P>
NOTE: PCM refers to the version 3.x Microsoft Mail for PC Networks driver
to allow the Microsoft Exchange client to connect to existing 3.x
postoffices.
<P>
<PRE>   To                 Mail 3.2    Mail NT Client    Exchange PCM driver
</PRE> 
<P>
<PRE>MSMail 3.2               N/A           N/A                N/A
MSMail NT Client         C              A                  A
Exchange PCM driver      B              B                  A

</PRE>A = LFN Preserved
B = LFN Not Preserved
C = LFN Preserved if on Windows 95 but cannot double-click to
<PRE>    access attachment. See Note.

</PRE>NOTE: When you send a message from a Windows NT client to a Mail 3.x client
on Windows 95, the LFN will be preserved. However, when you double-click
the attachment, you will get the following error:
<P>
<PRE>   No application is associated with the attached file 'xxxxx'. Use
   the File Manager to create an association.

</PRE>When you run File Manager or Explorer, you may see an association; however,
you will not be able to launch the attachment by double-clicking it. To
view the attachment, click Save Attachment on the File menu.
