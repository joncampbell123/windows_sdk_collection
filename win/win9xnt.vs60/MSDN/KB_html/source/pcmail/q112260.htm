The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, version 3.2
 
<P>
Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows can take several minutes to time out
(stop trying to send information) if your modem is turned off. If you have
time-out problems initializing your modem, make sure it is connected
properly and turned on.
<P>
For every "SEND" or "SENDLN" keyword in a script, Microsoft Mail Remote for
Windows writes to the serial communications layer and checks if the data
has been written. It also checks to see if the time is up. If the modem is
off or not attached, nothing gets sent. Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows
waits until the appropriate time-out for every "SEND" or "SENDLN."
Depending upon how many "SEND" or "SENDLN" commands are in your script,
this can take from several minutes to much longer.
