<P><h3>New Server Features in version 3.5</h3>
 
<P>
Multitasking MTA for Windows NT:
<P>
<PRE>   With Microsoft Windows NT support, you can run multiple instances of
   the External and Dispatch programs on a single computer. These can
   either be run as services within Windows NT, or as a console
   application.

   You can increase the number of remote postoffice links, provide
   modem pooling for Remote client users, and improve Directory
   Synchronization (Dir-Sync) service.

   To allow easier administration, these services can be remotely
   monitored from another Windows NT computer.

   NOTE: In pervious version of Microsoft Mail, the Multitasking MTA
   was a separate product. It is now included as a server component.

</PRE>Postoffice Diagnostics Utility:
<P>
<PRE>   The Microsoft Mail Postoffice Diagnostics utility is a Windows-based
   utility that checks and fixes Microsoft Mail databases.

   You can use the diagnostics utility to diagnose and resolve potential
   corruption problems on the postoffice.

   Microsoft designed this utility to enable you to better administer
   and maintain your Microsoft Mail postoffice.

</PRE><h3>New Utilities</h3>
 
<P>
A new set of utilities provides easier management of message files,
synchronization of Personal Address Books (PAB), and help to manage Dir-
Sync. The utilities are Those are provided on the Utilities disk. For more
information, please refer to Microsoft Mail Administrator's Guide, Appendix
A "Administrator Utilities."
<P>
The following is a list of the utilities that are in included with
Microsoft Mail for 3.5 and a brief description:
<P>
MS-DOS Client Utilities
<P>
The Flag Down Utility
The Flag Down utility, FLAGDOWN.COM, is for MS-DOS clients. It removes the
Mail flag that appears when you are running Monitor or Micro with the Flag
option specified and receive new mail. If you don't run the Flag Down
utility, you can make the flag disappear by pressing the hot key.
<P>
The Hot Key Utility
The Hot Key utility, HOTKEY.EXE, is for MS-DOS clients. It allows you to
check your Monitor or Micro hot key in case you have forgotten it.
<P>
The New Mail Utility
The New Mail utility, NEWMAIL.EXE, is for MS-DOS clients. It allows you to
check the postoffice for new mail, telling you the number of new mail items
and the number of unread mail items that you have.
<P>
The Remove It Utility
The Remove It utility, REMOVEIT.COM, is for MS-DOS clients. It removes the
Micro program or the Monitor program from your workstation's memory.
<P>
The Remove Operator Utility
The Remove Operator utility, REMOVEOP.COM, is for MS-DOS clients. It
removes the Operator program from your workstation's memory.
<P>
Administrator Utilities
<P>
NOTE: You can run the Rebuild and Import utilities on both MS-DOS and
Windows NT systems. All other utilities are for MS-DOS systems only.
<P>
The Re-sort Utility
The Re-sort utility, RESORT.EXE, is for administrators. When address lists
are exported, some countries sort their extended characters in a different
order than others do. Re-sort allows you to sort the address lists in a way
that is acceptable for your postoffice. See Appendix D of the Microsoft
Mail Administrators Guide, "Using Microsoft Mail in an International
Environment," for additional Re-sort utility applications.
<P>
The Folders Compression Utility
The Folders Compression utility, FOLDCOMP.EXE, is for administrators and MS-
DOS clients. It recovers disk space from folders. There may be space to
recover if mail has been deleted from the folders since the last time the
folders were compressed. The most common use of the Folders Compression
utility is by MS-DOS client users, to compress folders that have been moved
to hard disk storage on their own computers. Most administrators use the
Local-Admin Folders Compress option to compress folders on the server.
However, administrators can also use the Folders Compression Utility.
<P>
The Rebuild Utility
The Rebuild utility, REBUILD.EXE, is for administrators. It rebuilds the
Global Address List (GAL).
<P>
The Global Address List (GAL) lists all the addresses that are accessible
to users at your postoffice, combining entries from all address lists,
including gateway lists.  With it, users can select addresses from one list
rather than moving through several lists. Use of the Global Address List is
optional. When changes are made to any of the address lists at your
postoffice, the Global Address List must be rebuilt so that it reflects the
address changes. You can use the Rebuild utility to rebuild the Global
Address List. If you use directory synchronization, it rebuilds the Global
Address List for you. See Chapter 9 of the Microsoft Mail Administrator's
Guide, "Global Directory Synchronization," for more information.
<P>
The Import Utility
<P>
Administrators can use the Import utility, IMPORT.EXE, to:

<UL><LI>Import local postoffice user information.

<LI>Import external postoffice and gateway user information.

<LI>Import users' names extracted from the LAN Manager account service or
   the Novell Bindery with the LMEXT.EXE and NOVEXT.EXE utilities.
<P>
</UL>Windows Utilities
<P>
Convert Utility
The Convert utility converts version 2.1 MS-DOS, Windows, and Presentation
Manager client folders to the version 3.0 format. It is described in the
documentation for the Windows and Presentation Manager clients.
<P>
Move User Utility
Use the Move User utility, MOVEUSER.EXE, to move users to another
postoffice or delete users from your postoffice. To move users directly
between postoffices, both postoffices must be connected by a direct MS-DOS
drive. Move User copies the user's mail information to a new postoffice; it
does not remove the user from the original postoffice. The user's Mail
information remains until you delete it. If postoffices are not on the same
network, you can use Move User to export mailboxes to a file that can be
imported into a postoffice on another network.
<P>
Microsoft Mail Gateway to AT&amp;T Mail
<P>
Also included in Microsoft Mail 3.5 is the Microsoft Mail Gateway to AT&amp;T
Mail. This is a software package that provides connectivity of Microsoft
Mail software to the AT&amp;T Mail network. Connectivity of Microsoft Mail to
AT&amp;T Mail through the Gateway lets users of Microsoft Mail communicate
globally using the AT&amp;T Mail service. Users must have contact AT&amp;T Mail in
order to establish an account and obtain the appropriate software before
using this gateway. Please refer to the Microsoft Mail Gateway to AT&amp;T Mail
Administrator's Guide for additional information.
<P>
Microsoft Electronic Forms Designer for Microsoft Mail for Windows.
<P>

a generic template that you use as a foundation for all of your forms. The
electronic forms (eforms) you develop can structure information and
