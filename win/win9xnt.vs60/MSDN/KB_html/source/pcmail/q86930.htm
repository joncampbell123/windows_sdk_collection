The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail Gateway to 3Com 3+Mail, version 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
Before you install the Microsoft Mail Gateway to 3Com 3+Mail, you need
to perform the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Connect to the network drive where the Microsoft Mail data files are
   located. You must have full access rights to the mail data files.

<P><LI>On the local drive of the dedicated gateway PC, create a subdirectory
   for the gateway files. You must create a directory before
   installation; the installation program does not do this for you.

<P><LI>Log on to both the 3+Open Network and the 3+Name Service as
   the administrative user.

<P><LI>Make note of the name of the 3+Mail Service that is running.
<P>
</OL>Once you have done this, make sure you have the following information
ready for the installation:

<UL><LI>The drive and path to the directory where the gateway files are to
   go.

<LI>The unique DOMAIN:ORGANIZATION the _GATEWAY user will be defined in.
   This must be a new DOMAIN:ORGANIZATION; it uniquely identifies the
   3+Mail gateway. This DOMAIN:ORGANIZATION is created in the
   3+Name Service. The _GATEWAY user also is created in this
   DOMAIN:ORGANIZATION, which acts as the mailbag for all mail going
   from 3+Mail to MS Mail.

<LI>The full three-part name of the mail server for the _GATEWAY user.
   This is in the format SERVERNAME:DOMAIN:ORGANIZATION.
<P>
</UL>The remaining installation questions can be changed later or left at
the default.
