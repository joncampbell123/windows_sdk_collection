The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail Gateway to 3Com 3+Mail, version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Mail for PC Networks Gateway to 3Com 3+Mail, version 1.00,
sometimes does not run after a successful installation, or the gateway
stops working even though nothing seems to have changed since the last
time it was run.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
You may have an invalid installation configuration.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Validate the installation configuration by validating the contents and
location of the GATEWAY.INI file. The GATEWAY.INI file must reside in the
same directory as the GATEWAY.EXE file (the executable file).
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Sample GATEWAY.INI File</h3>
 
<P>
[3+Mail_PCMail]
<PRE>     MSMailDrive = M:\MAILDAT\
     FFAPIPath = M:\3GATEWAY\
     3ComGateDomain = MSMAIL:CORP
     3ComDefaultDomain = HQ:CORP
     MSNotifyUser = MAIN/P01/ADMIN
     3ComNotifyUser = ADMIN:HQ:CORP
     GatewayPath = M:\3GATEWAY\
     AuditFile = M:\3GATEWAY\LOGS\AUDIT.LOG
     ErrorFile = M:\3\GATEWAY\ERROR.LOG
     BadMessageFile = M:\3GATEWAY\LOGS\BADMSG.LOG
     MFFSendFile = MMFF.PUT
     MFFRetrvFile = MMFF.GET
     ImmFireKey = F10
     ShutdownKey = F3
     Max3ComMsgSize = 20232
     MaxPCMailMsgSize = 4000000
     DefaultShutdownInt = 0
     FireInterval = 240
     Pass3ComAtch = YES
     Break3ComMsg = YES
     BreakPCMailMsg = YES
     3ComProperty = 5001

</PRE>Here is a list of items to check:

<UL><LI>The path statements for MSMailDrive, FFAPIPath, and GatewayPath must
   all end with a backslash (\). Other path statements must end with a
   filename.

<LI>The directory listed for MSMailDrive must be the current MS-DOS
   directory. In other words, for the example above, if you type DIR M:,
   the directory listing should list the subdirectories for the logical
   root of the Microsoft Mail database (ATT, GLB, NME, MAI, P1, and
   so on).

<LI>The location listed in FFAPIPath must contain the two spawned
   executables, COURGET.EXE and COURPUT.EXE.

<LI>All the directories listed must have Read/Write/Create/Delete
   permissions for temporary files used by the gateway.

<LI>The property number listed for the XNS name service must be correct.
   You can use the 3Com 3N utility and issue a 3N DIR PROP 5001 (or
   whatever is listed) command to validate the entries for that property.

<LI>3ComGateDomain must not be the same as 3ComDefaultDomain.

<LI>The PC running GATEWAY.EXE must be logged in to the XNS name service
   as the _GATEWAY user in the 3ComGateDomain.
