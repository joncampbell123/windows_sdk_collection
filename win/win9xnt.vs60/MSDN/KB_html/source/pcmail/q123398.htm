The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you delete a group from the originating postoffice, the groups
containing a group address of 10 characters (the maximum number of
characters allowed is 10) will remain undeleted from all other postoffices
participating in directory synchronization (Dir-Sync) for version 3.2 of
Microsoft Mail for PC Networks.
<P>
During the Dir-Sync processing of this group's delete transaction, at time
T2 (SRVMAIN -t) on the Dir-Sync server, the following error message will
appear in the DIRSYNC.LOG file:
<P>
<PRE>   10/24/94 14:32:18 | Error  [ 20] Address element is too long: &lt;Group
   Address Name&gt;

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Dir-Sync process appears to append an additional character to the group
address name within the MSTTRANS.GLB file on the Dir-Sync server. This
additional character generates the error described above.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 3.2 of Microsoft
Mail for PC Networks.This problem was corrected in version 3.2.12 of
ADMIN.EXE. If you do not have version 3.2.12 (or later), you can download
ADMUPD.EXE, a self-extracting file, on the following services:

<UL><LI>Microsoft's World Wide Web Site on the Internet
   On the www.Microsoft.com home page, click the support icon.
   Click Knowledge Base, and select product.
   Enter kbfile AMDUPD.EXE, click GO!
   Open the article, and click the button to download the file.

<LI>Internet  (anonymous FTP)
   FTP FTP.Microsoft.Com
   Change to the Softlib\Mslfiles folder.
   Get AMDUPD.EXE

<LI>The Microsoft Network
<PRE>   On the Edit menu, click Go To, and then click Other     Location.
   Type "mssupport" (without the quotation marks).
   Double-click the MS Software Library icon.
   Find the appropriate product area.
   Locate and download AMDUPD.EXE.

</PRE><LI>Microsoft Download Service (MSDL)
   Dial (206) 936-6735 to connect to MSDL.
   Download AMDUPD.EXE.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When Dir-Sync propagates user and group names from externally defined
postoffices, these names are stored in a .USR file on the postoffice
database. To delete these invalid group names, run the ADMIN.EXE program
against the postoffices that still have the deleted groups showing in the
global address list (GAL), and select External-Admin, List. Provide the
correct Network and Postoffice name and simply delete the invalid group
name from each postoffice exhibiting this problem. Run REBUILD.EXE to
recreate the GAL without this group.
<P>
If the mail administrator also added this invalid group to the local
postoffices postoffice address list (POL or ADMIN.NME file), then run
ADMIN.EXE and select Address, Delete to delete this group name from the
POL.
<P>
Again, REBUILD.EXE must be run to update the GAL.
