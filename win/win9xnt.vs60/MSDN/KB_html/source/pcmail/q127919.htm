The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.2 and 3.2a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
With version 3.2.11, 3.2.12, 3.2.13, and 3.2.14 of EXTERNAL.EXE, if mail is
received at a postoffice with an unknown address, you will receive the
error:
<P>
<PRE>   [002] Mail was received that was addressed to unknown addresses.

</PRE>The unknown addresses of the original mail message will not be added to the
report in the SYSTEM.LOG. Versions earlier than 3.2.11 of EXTERNAL.EXE
would include the invalid addresses as part of the report.
<P>
Also, the non-delivery report mailed back to the sender would not include
the invalid addresses. In version earlier than 3.2.11, the addresses were
included.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Revisions to the External program in version 3.2.11 resulted in this
behavior.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions 3.2.11, 3.2.12,
3.2.13, and 3.2.14 of EXTERNAL.EXE. This problem was corrected in
EXTERNAL.EXE version 3.2.15 (or later).
