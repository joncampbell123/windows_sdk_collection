The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail Multitasking MTA for Windows NT, version 3.5
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When a Windows NT Multitasking MMTA (NT MMTA) Dispatch or External instance
is running, Control Panel, Services shows the instance as started and mail
is being moved, or Performance Monitor (PerfMon) shows the appropriate
number of OS/2 processes active.
<P>
However, when you start a Monitor for the instance from the Mail Service
Manager, you will get an MS-DOS box that flashes open and closes. In
addition, when you start a Monitor for the instance from the Command
window, you will get the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Error: Service instance not found. Service may not be running.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The NT MMTA instance was previously stopped while a Monitor was connected
to it. The instance was restarted while the Monitor was still open. The
running Monitor did not connect to the restarted NT MMTA instance (expected
behavior), and the Monitor was closed.
<P>
All subsequent tries to start a Monitor for the restarted NT MMTA instance
will fail with the symptoms given above.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Stop the problem NT MMTA instance, and start it again. Then start a Monitor
for the instance; the Monitor should start successfully and connect to the
NT MMTA instance.
<P>
In the future, if an NT MMTA instance has a Monitor running, make sure the
Monitor is stopped when the instance is stopped.
