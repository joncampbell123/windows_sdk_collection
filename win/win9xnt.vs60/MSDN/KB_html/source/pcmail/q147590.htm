The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.2
<LI>Microsoft Mail Gateway to Fax, version 3.0
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, version 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Mail Fax driver is a Microsoft Windows printer driver that
allows you to send a fax (document or image) through Microsoft Mail for
Windows and the Microsoft Mail Gateway to Fax.
<P>
During the installation of the driver through Control Panel Printers, the
Setup program will give you the following option:
<P>
<PRE>   A Send Fax command can be installed on your Microsoft Excel
   File menu. It allows you to send documents as fax directly from
   Microsoft Excel.
   Do you want this command to be installed for you?

</PRE>If you choose the OK button, the MSFAX.XLA file will be copied to your
Microsoft Excel XLSTART subdirectory and Send Fax will be added to the
Microsoft Excel File menu.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If you choose not to have Send Fax added to Microsoft Excel when you
install the Microsoft Mail Fax driver, or if the installation fails to add
the feature, you can enable the feature through one of the following
methods.
<P>
<P><h3>METHOD ONE: Removing and Re-installing the printer driver</h3>
 
<P>
Use this method to completely remove the driver and re-add it. You will
lose any configuration settings for the driver.

<OL><P><LI>Open the Control Panel, and select Printers.

<P><LI>Select the Microsoft Fax driver under Installed Printers.

<P><LI>Select the Remove button.

<P><LI>Select the Add button.

<P><LI>In the List of Printers box, select Install Unlisted or Updated
   Printer.

<P><LI>Choose the Install button.

<P><LI>When the dialog box appears prompting you for the disk, insert the
   Microsoft Fax disk and select Browse.

<P><LI>In the Browse dialog box, select the drive and subdirectory that
   represents your country, and choose the OK button.
<P>
   For example the following will install the driver if your disk is
   inserted into the A:\ drive, and you are installing for USA:
<P>
<P><PRE>      a:\usa
</PRE>
<P><LI>In the List of Printers dialog box, make sure Microsoft Fax is
   selected and choose the OK button.
<P>
   The Microsoft Fax printer driver will install, and you will be
   asked if you want the Send Fax option installed on the File menu in
   Microsoft Excel.
<P>
</OL><h3>METHOD TWO: Installing MSFAX.XLA as a Microsoft Excel Add-In</h3>
 
<P>
This method may be necessary if you do not want to change the settings for
the Microsoft Fax printer driver you already installed. You may also need
to use this method if Send Fax option disappears from the File menu in
Microsoft Excel after the initial installation.

<OL><P><LI>Start Microsoft Excel.

<P><LI>Choose Add-Ins from the Tools menu.

<P><LI>In the Add-Ins box, select Browse.

<P><LI>Enter the path to the MSFAX.XLA file. If you previously installed
   the driver, this file may be in your Microsoft Excel XLSTART
   subdirectory. You may also install the file from the Microsoft Fax disk
   that is included with Microsoft Mail Gateway to Fax, as well as with
   version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows.
<P>
   If you install from the Microsoft Fax disk, select the drive and
   subdirectory that represents your country, and choose the OK button.
<P>
   For example the following will install the driver if your disk is
   inserted into the A:\ drive, and you are installing for USA:
<P>
<P><PRE>      a:\usa
</PRE><P>
   The driver will now be listed under Add-Ins as Msfax and Send Fax
   will be available on the File menu in Microsoft Excel.
