The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Win32 Application Programming Interface (API) included with:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Microsoft Windows NT versions 3.5 and 3.51
    - Microsoft Windows 95 version 4.0
    - Microsoft Win32s version 1.2
</UL></PRE> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Resource sections are read-only by default under Windows NT and Win32s.
However, under Windows NT, the resource section may appear to be
read/write. If an application tries to write to the resource section, an
exception occurs. Windows NT handles the exception by duplicating the page
and making it read/write. Therefore, under Windows NT it is possible to
write to the resource section, even though its section attribute is
read-only.
<P>
In Win32s version 1.2, the resource section is read-only and you cannot
write to it. To work around this, link with /SECTION:.rsrc,rw to make the
resource section read/write. Or copy the resource to your own buffer and
work with it from there. You cannot modify the protection of the resource
section because the memory is owned by the system.
<P>
In Win32s version 1.25a and later, the resource section is read/write,
regardless of what is specified in the section attributes.
<P>
Windows 95 has a handler similar to the one used in Windows NT.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Under Windows NT, the default top level handler detects writes to
resources and will make the resource writable. If you are running outside
of a debugger and you have no exception handler, your resource writes will
silently work. If you are running under the debugger, your resource write
will look like an access violation:
<P>
<PRE>   First-Chance Exception in msin32.exe: 0xC0000005: Access Violation

</PRE>This allows you to "fix" your resource writes. If you have the debugger
pass on the exception to your application and you have no handler, the
default handler will make your resource writable.
<P>
The disadvantage of setting the attribute of the resource section to
read/write is that Windows NT and Windows 95 will use a separate copy of
the resource section for each process that uses this section, instead of
one copy for all processes.
