<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
A popular method used to perform a fade on an image is to animate
the palette. An application displays a bitmap, and then animates the
palette to all black, fading the image into blackness.
<P>
To perform the fade in the opposite direction, starting with all
black and fading into color, requires some additional ingenuity.
The original BitBlt() that gets the image's bits on the screen must
be done without color matching. Because all of the pixels are intended to
be black, if color matching were used, the pixels would be matched to the
same palette entry. A subsequent palette animation would result in a single-
colored rectangle.
<P>
You can take advantage of an optimization in Windows to work around this
issue. When Windows is performing a BitBlt and it detects that an identity
palette is being used, no color matching is performed. The source bits are
moved to the destination unchanged. To perform a fade from black to color,
use an identity palette to get the bits onto the screen and then fade the
palette from all black to the original bitmap's desired colors.
<P>
To prepare a bitmap to use an identity palette, you must reduce the image
from 256 colors to 236. An identity palette must contain the system entries
in its first and last ten entries. The code in the sample below that
reduces the image to 236 colors must first calculate the optimal 236 colors
from a 256 color table. It then determines how close the colors are to each
other, and discards colors that have close matches while keeping colors
that have no close matches. Once it determines the best 236 colors,
BitBlt() maps the 256 color image to 236 colors. Everything is then moved
up ten to allow for the system colors in the identity palette.
<P>
This sample application in FADEIN.EXE contains code that performs the
following tasks:

<UL><LI>Creates a DIBSection from a bitmap stored as a resource

<LI>Chooses the optimal 236 colors from a 256 color table

<LI>Reduces a 256 color DIBSection to 236 colors

<LI>Creates an identity palette

<LI>Performs palette animation to fade from black to color
