The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Win32 Software Development Kit (SDK) on the following
   platform:
<P><PRE>    - Windows 95
</PRE><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
<LI>Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release versions 1.0, 2.0, 2.1, 2.5
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When a window's map mode is set to either MM_ISOTROPIC or MM_ANISOTROPIC,
and the window extents or viewport extents are changed, then a previously
selected font instance cannot be found in the GDI font instance heap
because the extents are part of the lookup comparison criteria. This
results in 52 bytes of lost heap space for each new font instance.
<P>
The system may eventually hang due to lack of memory.
<P>
The window's map mode setting is not exposed directly in the user interface
of a program, whereas a change in a font or a window's "zoom factor" (often
controlled by the extents) is exposed directly in the user interface.
Therefore, you are limited in what you can do to minimize the effects of
this problem.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When a font is selected into a device context, the current window and
viewport extents are copied to a structure that is stored in an internal
"font instance" heap. A search is conducted in this heap for the current
font, so that it can be freed. The lookup criteria to find this includes
the window and viewport extents. If either of these extents have changed
since the current font was selected, then the lookup fails and the item is
not removed from the heap, which results in a loss of 52 bytes of memory.
<P>
Note that the values for the window and viewport origin do not affect this
problem. In addition, the trouble only manifests when either the
MM_ISOTROPIC and MM_ANISOTROPIC mapping modes are set.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
The following algorithm is recommended for WM_PAINT handling, and it
assumes that:

<UL><LI>New or modified extents have been saved for use when this message
   arrives.

<LI>Either the MM_ISOTROPIC or MM_ANISOTROPIC mapping mode is in force.
<P>
</UL>To use this algorithm:

<OL><P><LI>Select a new font.

<P><LI>Set new extents.

<P><LI>Draw, output text, and so on.

<P><LI>Restore original extents.

<P><LI>Select the original font.
<P>
</OL>A standard method for storing data unique to a window procedure and
instance is through the GetWindowLong() and SetWindowLong() API calls. You
use the value DWL_USER for the nIndex parameter to save the address of data
allocated during WM_CREATE code execution. Please refer to the Win32
Programmer's Reference for additional information.
<P>
The C code fragment below is an example that describes the algorithm
mentioned above, and assumes that the map mode and the values in the global
SIZE structure "sWinExt" are being modified elsewhere in the program:
<P>
<P><h3>Sample Code</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   SIZE sWinExt = {1,1};
   SIZE sOldWinExt = {1,1};
   
   LRESULT APIENTRY WndProc(HWND hwnd, UINT message, WPARAM wParam,
                            LPARAM lParam)
   {
      HDC hDC;
      HFONT hFont;
      PAINTSTRUCT ps;
   
      switch (message) {
      case WM_PAINT:
         hDC = BeginPaint(hwnd,&amp;ps);
         hFont = SelectObject(hDC,GetStockObject(ANSI_VAR_FONT));
         SetWindowExtEx(hDC,sWinExt.cx,sWinExt.cy,&amp;sOldWinExt);
         // Draw, output text, and so on.
         SetWindowExtEx(hDC,sOldWinExt.cx,sOldWinExt.cy,NULL);
         SelectObject(hDC,hFont);
         EndPaint(hwnd, &amp;ps);
         return 0;

<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Fonts are normally selected in the code that handles a WM_PAINT message for
a given window. Window and viewport extents are typically modified
according to the user's choice for a window "zoom factor" by resizing the
window itself or by predetermined factors involving screen resolution and
presentation data, such as that used for CAD.
