The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Win32 Application Programming Interface (API) included with:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Microsoft Windows NT versions 3.1 and 3.5
</UL></PRE> 
<P>
Each time Windows NT creates an object, such as a process or a thread, it
must allocate a certain amount of physical memory (nonpaged pool) for its
support. The amount of memory that is needed for support of a process
object is significantly higher than the memory requirement for support of a
thread object. The amount of memory that is required for a thread object
on a RISC machine is higher than the memory requirement for a thread on an
x86 machine, due to the greater number and size of registers on the RISC
machines.
<P>
Due to the physical memory requirement of processes and threads, programs
that use the CreateProcess() and CreateThread() APIs should be careful to
check their return codes to detect out-of-memory conditions.
<P>
On Windows NT 3.5, each time a process is created it reserves the minimum
working set of memory. On a 32 MB system, the default minimum working set
is 200 KB. Therefore, on a 32 MB system, you can create ~100 processes. You
can lower your minimum working set to 80 KB (the lowest allowed) with the
following call:
<P>
<PRE>   SetProcessWorkingSetSize( (HANDLE)(-1), 20*4096, 100*4096 );
