The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Win32 Application Programming Interface (API) included with:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Microsoft Windows NT version 3.5, 3.51, 4.0
</UL></PRE> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you impersonate a client through a function such as
ImpersonateNamedPipeClient, there are two different ways to track the
security context of the client. With dynamic tracking, the server
applications are continually updated to match changes to the clients
security context. With static tracking, the server has the security context
of the client at the time the impersonation is done.
<P>
The tracking mode, which is defined in the SDK documentation as part of the
Security Quality of Service information, can be specified by the server
when the named pipe is opened with CreateFile(). In the
dwFlagsAndAttributes parameter, specify SECURITY_CONTEXT_TRACKING to enable
dynamic tracking. If the client does not specify a level, then the default
security tracking mode is static.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Suppose there are three threads (A, B, and C) where:
<P>
<PRE>   A calls B through a named pipe and B does ImpersonateNamedPipeClient

   B calls C through a named pipe and C does ImpersonateNamedPipeClient

</PRE>If B and C both specify dynamic tracking, then the security context of C
is continually updated to match the security context of A as long as
B and C continue to impersonate.
<P>
NOTE: Dynamic tracking is not supported between machines. In the above
example, if A and B are on one machine, and C is on a second machine, C
would successfully impersonate A via B, but with static tracking.
<P>
Delegation past one machine is not supported, either. If A, B, and C were
all on separate machines, the call from B to C would not authenticate as A.
