The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Win32 Application Programming Interface (API) included with:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Microsoft Windows NT versions 3.5, 3.51
</UL></PRE> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If a service running in the Local System account attempts to open a named
pipe on a computer running Windows NT version 3.5, the operation may fail
with an Access Denied error (error 5). This can happen even if the pipe was
created with a NULL DACL.
<P>
NOTE: For more information about placing a NULL DACL on a named pipe,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../win32sdk/q102798.htm">Q102798</A></B>
   TITLE     : Security Attributes on Objects

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
In Windows NT version 3.1, a process running in the Local System account
could connect to a resource using a Null Session. For security reasons, use
of the Null Session is restricted by default on Windows NT version 3.5.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
You can allow access to a named pipe using the Null Session by adding
the pipe name to the following registry entry on the machine that
creates the named pipe:
<P>
<PRE>   \HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\
      Parameters\NullSessionPipes

</PRE>The pipe name added to this entry is the name after the last backslash
in the string used to open the pipe. For example, if you use the following
string to open the pipe:
<P>
<PRE>   \\hardknox\pipe\mypipe

</PRE>you would add mypipe to the NullSessionPipes entry on the computer named
hardknox.
<P>
You must either reboot or restart (stop and then start) the Server service
for changes in this entry to take effect. Also, the named pipe will still
need to have a NULL DACL.
<P>
In Windows NT 3.51, by customer request, it is no longer necessary to
reboot. Once a named pipe is added to the key listed above, null-session
connections to that pipe will immediately be accessible.
<P>
This new functionality allows programs to permit null session access
to named pipes that do not have names known prior to booting the
system.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Usually, when a session is established between a computer supplying a
resource (server) and a computer that wants to use the resource (client),
the client is identified and credentials are verified. When a Null Session
is used, there is no validation of the client; everyone is allowed access.
<P>
If you allow a pipe to be used by a Null Session, you should either:

<UL><LI>Verify that the data supplied by the pipe is truly public.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE>
<LI>Use an alternative method for verifying clients.
