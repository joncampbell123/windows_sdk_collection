<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The syntax for the module-definition statements HEAPSIZE and STACKSIZE is
as follows
<P>
<PRE>   HEAPSIZE  [reserve] [,commit]
   STACKSIZE [reserve] [,commit]

</PRE>The remarks for HEAPSIZE and STACKSIZE on page 62 of the "Tools User's
Guide" manual that comes with the Win32 SDK state the following:
<P>
<PRE>   When commit is less than reserve, memory demands are reduced but
   execution time is slower.

</PRE>By default, commit is less than reserve.
<P>
The reason that execution time is slower (and it is actually only
fractionally slower), is that the system sets up guard pages and could have
to process guard page faults.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If the committed memory is less than the reserved memory, the system sets
up guard page(s) around the heap or stack. When the heap or stack grows big
enough, the guard pages start accessing outside the committed area. This
causes a guard page fault, which tells the system to map in another page.
The application continues to run as if you had originally had the new page
committed.
<P>
If the committed memory is greater than the reserve, no guard pages are
created and the program faults if it goes outside the committed memory
area.
<P>
Experimenting with the commit versus reserve numbers may result in a
combination that would produce noticeable results, but for most
applications, this difference is probably not noticeable. The potential
benefits do not warrant significant experimentation.
