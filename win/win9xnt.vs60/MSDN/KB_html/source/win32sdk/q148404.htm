<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Windows 3.1 developers who require high precision timers can use the
multimedia timers, which are accurate to 10 milliseconds (ms) in most
cases. However, in the multithreaded environments of Windows NT and
Windows 95, the resolution and accuracy of the multimedia timers may
often be reduced due to the preemptive nature of the operating systems.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In Windows 3.1, multimedia timers are serviced by an interrupt service
routine (ISR) which is tied to the computer's clock. When a tick on the
clock occurs, Windows suspends the running program and services the tick.
Should your application use multimedia timers (by using TimeSetEvent() and
any of the CALLBACK flags), Windows executes your callback function before
returning control to the suspended program. Servicing your callback
function during the hardware timer tick provides high precision timing
because your callback is being executed within the timer interrupt, and
interrupt routines cannot, themselves, be interrupted.
<P>
The multithreaded environments of Windows NT and Windows 95 employ CPU
scheduling techniques to improve processor utilization and smooth
multitasking. The portions of code, called threads, within the system are
organized into queues and assigned priorities. Threads of code required by
the operating system are assigned high priorities. The thread scheduler
allows a thread a predetermined amount of execution time (quantum). Then it
evicts the thread from the processor until all threads at the specific
priority level have been serviced. The process continues at the next,
lower, priority level. The timer-servicing thread, like applications, is
subject to CPU scheduling and eviction regardless of the thread priority.
Given that the number of threads ready for execution changes frequently,
the period between timer thread executions can vary dramatically.
<P>
For example, say five time-critical threads are ready for execution, and
the quantum is q milliseconds. If the timer thread is fifth, four threads
execute before the timer thread is executed; q milliseconds x 4. This means
that if q is 25 milliseconds, 100 milliseconds will have elapsed before the
fifth thread is executed. Boosting the priority of the thread that created
the timer risks introducing instability in the system by starving the
time-sensitive, system-critical threads.
