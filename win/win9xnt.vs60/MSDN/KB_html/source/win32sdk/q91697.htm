<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The dialog editor needs a way to know what include file is associated with
a resource file that it opens. Rather than prompt the user for the name of
the include file, the name of the include file is embedded in the resource
file in most cases.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Embedding the name of the include file is done with a resource of type
RCDATA with the special name DLGINCLUDE. This resource is placed into the
.RES file and contains the name of the include file. The dialog editor
looks for this resource when it loads a .RES file. If this resource is
found, then the include file is opened also; if not, the editor prompts the
user for the name of the include file.
<P>
In some Windows 3.1 build environments, the dialog editor was used to
create dialogs that were placed in more than one .DLG file. These different
.DLG files were then included in one .RC file, which was compiled with the
resource compiler. Therefore, the resource file gets multiple copies of a
RCDATA type resource with the same name, DLGINCLUDE, but the resource
compiler and dialog editor don't complain.
<P>
In the Win32 SDK, changes were made so that this resource has its own
resource type; it was changed from an RCDATA-type resource with the
special name, DLGINCLUDE, to a DLGINCLUDE resource type whose name can
be specified. The dialog editor would look for resources of the type
DLGINCLUDE.
<P>
We are being more strict about the need for resources to be unique in the
Win32 SDK than the Windows 3.1 SDK. This is good because there was never
any guarantee at run time as to which of the two or more resources would be
returned by LoadResource().
<P>
This means that some applications being ported to Windows NT give an error
when their resources are compiled because they have duplicate RCDATA type
resources with the same name (DLGINCLUDE). This error is by design. The
workaround is straightforward: delete all the DLGINCLUDE RCDATA type
resource statements from all the .DLG files.
<P>
Finally, because it does not make sense to have the DLGINCLUDE type
resources in the executable, the linker will strip them out so that they
don't get linked into the EXE.
