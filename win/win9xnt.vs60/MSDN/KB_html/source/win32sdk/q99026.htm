<UL><LI>Microsoft Win32 Application Programming Interface (API) included with:

<P><PRE>    - Microsoft Windows NT versions 3.1, 3.5, 3.51, 4.0
</UL></PRE>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Computers running Windows NT may be unable to set the same serial baud
rates due to differences in serial port hardware on various platforms and
machines. These differences may be important to note when writing a serial
communications application that runs on different Windows NT platforms.
<P>
The simplest way to determine what baud rates are available on a particular
serial port is to call the GetCommProperties() application programming
interface (API) and examine the COMMPROP.dwSettableBaud bitmask to
determine what baud rates are supported on that serial port.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Some baud rates may be available on one machine and not on another because
of differences in the serial port hardware used on the two machines. Most
Intel 80x86 machines use a standard 1.8432 megahertz (MHz) clock speed on
serial port hardware, and therefore most Intel machines can set the same
baud rates. However, on other platforms, such as MIPS, there is no standard
serial port clock speed. MIPS serial ports are known to exist with 1.8432
MHz, 3.072 MHz, 4.2336 MHz, and 8.0 MHz serial port clock chips. Future NT
implementations on other platforms may have different serial port clock
speeds as well.
<P>
Furthermore, certain requested baud rates are special-cased in the Windows
NT serial driver so that they will work. The following are these special
cases:
<P>
<PRE>   MHz     Requested Baud    Divisor   Resulting Baud Rate (+/- 1)
  ---------------------------------------------------------------

   1.8432      56000            2              57600
   3.072       14400           13              14769
   4.2336       9600           28               9450
   4.2336      14400           18              14700
   4.2336      19200           14              18900
   4.2336      38400            7              37800
   4.2336      56000            5              52920
   8.0         14400           35              14286
   8.0         56000            9              55556

</PRE>The actual baud rate can be calculated by dividing the divisor multiplied
by 16 into the clock rate. For example, for a 1.8432 MHz clock and a
divisor of 2, the baud rate would be:
<P>
<PRE>   1843200 Hz / (2 * 16) = 57600

</PRE>For all other cases, as long as the requested baud rate is within 1 percent
of the nearest baud rate that can be found with an integer divisor, the
baud rate request will succeed.
