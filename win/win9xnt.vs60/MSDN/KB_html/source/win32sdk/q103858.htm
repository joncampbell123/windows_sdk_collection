<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Windows NT's Copy on Write page protection is a concept that allows
multiple applications to map their virtual address spaces to share the same
physical pages, until an application needs to modify the page and have its
own instance copy. This is part of a technique called Lazy Evaluation,
which allows the system to not waste time by committing resources, time, or
execution until/unless absolutely necessary. Copy on Write allows the
virtual memory manager to save memory and execution time.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Copy on Write works as follows: In generic terms, an application can load
something into its virtual memory (for example, a code section or DLL
code). Virtual memory is mapped to physical memory. Another process may
want to load the same thing into its virtual memory. As long as neither
process writes to this memory, they can map to, and share, the same
physical pages.
<P>
If either process needs to write to this memory, because the memory is
marked as Copy on Write, the physical page frame will be copied somewhere
else in physical memory. Fixups are made for the virtual memory mapping of
the writing process. Both applications now have their own instance of the
memory contents. In short, applications can share the same physical memory
with Copy on Write, until one of the applications has to modify the
contents. At that point, a new copy of the contents is made, and the
writing process has its own copy.
<P>
It should be emphasized that this is not to say that applications are
sharing memory in the sense that one application can write to it and
another can read what the first one wrote; as long as applications are only
going to read a piece of memory (for example, a code section), then the
physical pages supporting that memory for the applications can be shared.
Once the application needs to write to the memory (for example, in the form
of a fixup), then that application must have a new physical page so that
the modifications are not seen by other processes. The processes are no
longer sharing the same physical pages.
<P>
<P><h3>Applications</h3>
 
<P>
When multiple instances of the same Windows-based application load, you may
notice that most, if not all, of their instance handles (hInstance) have
the same value. In fact, almost all of the windows on the desktop have this
value, which represents the base address where the application loaded in
virtual memory.
<P>
Each of the instances of the same application running has its own protected
virtual address space to run in. If each of these applications can load
into its default base address, each will map to, and be able to share, the
same physical pages in memory. Using Copy on Write, the system will allow
these applications to share the same physical pages until one of the
applications modifies a page. Then a copy is made in physical memory, and
that process's virtual memory is fixed up to use the new physical page. If
for some reason one of these instances cannot load in the desired base
address, it will get its own physical pages. See the section on DLLs below
for more explanation.
<P>
<P><h3>DLLs</h3>
 
<P>
Dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) are created with a default base address to
load at. Assuming that multiple applications call the DLL, they will all
try to load it within their own address space at that default virtual
address. If they are all successful, they can all map that virtual address
space to share the same physical pages.
<P>
However, if for some reason the DLL cannot be loaded within the process's
address space at the default address, it will load the DLL elsewhere. The
DLL must be copied into another physical address frame. The reason is that
fixups for jump instructions in a DLL are written as specific locations
within the DLL's pages. If the DLL can be loaded at the same base address
for each process, the second to the nth process does not have to write that
memory location for the jump. If a process cannot load the DLL at the
specified base address, the locations written in the DLL's jumps will be
different for this process. This forces the fixup to write a new location
into the jump, and the Copy on Write will automatically force a new
physical page.
<P>
Note that all references to data must be fixed up too. If this causes
virtual memory of the code section to be updated, then the process will
again go through the Copy on Write process. For example, if there are a
great many places in the code section that make reference into data in a
DLL, if the DLL cannot be loaded at its default location, the locations in
the code section data in the DLL are referenced will have to be modified.
If this is one of multiple instances of a process, these fixups must go
through the copy on write process, and the virtual memory pages of the
process's code section will not be able to map and share the same physical
pages as the other instances. If there are a lot of references to the data
in the DLL by the code section, this can essentially cause the entire code
section to be copied to new physical pages.
<P>
<P><h3>POSIX</h3>
 
<P>
In POSIX, there is a fork() instruction that basically creates two copies
of the same program. It is an expensive process for the system to copy the
address space of one process into another. Instead, under Windows NT, the
system simply marks the parent's pages with Copy on Write. This way new
physical frames are copied only if and when they are needed (have been
modified). The system does not waste time or memory if all of the address
space doesn't need to be copied. (For more information, see "Inside Windows
NT" by Microsoft Press).
