<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The kernel schedules a thread with the real-time process priority class
ahead of every thread with another priority class (nearly all user-mode
threads). Windows NT does not alter the priority of real-time threads. The
system trusts that the programmer will avoid priority inversion. The
remainder of this article talks about the scheduling of threads that are
not real-time priority class and how the system solves the problem of
priority inversion.
<P>
Threads are scheduled according to their priority. When the kernel is
choosing which thread will execute on a processor, the highest dynamic
(variable) priority thread is picked. Priority inversion occurs when two
(or more) threads with different priorities are in contention to be
scheduled. Consider a simple case with three threads: Thread 1 is high
priority and becomes ready to be scheduled, while thread 2, a low-priority
thread, is executing in a critical section. Thread 1, the high-priority
thread, begins waiting for a shared resource from thread 2. A third thread
has medium priority. The third thread receives all the processor time,
because the high-priority thread (thread 1) is busy waiting for shared
resources from the low-priority thread (thread 2). Thread 2 won't leave the
critical section, because it isn't the highest priority thread and won't be
scheduled.
<P>
The Windows NT scheduler solves this problem by randomly boosting the
priority of threads that are ready to run (in this case the low priority
lock-holders). The low priority threads run long enough to let go of their
lock (exit the critical section), and the high- priority thread gets the
lock back. If the low-priority thread doesn't get enough CPU time to free
its lock the first time, it will get another chance on the next scheduling
round.
<P>
Priority inversion is handled differently in Windows 95. If a high priority
thread is dependent on a low priority thread which will not be allowed to
run because a medium priority thread is getting all of the CPU time, the
system recognizes that the high priority thread is dependent on the low
priority thread and will boost the low priority thread's priority up to the
priority of the high priority thread. This will allow the formerly low
priority thread to run and unblock the high priority thread that was
waiting on it.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Each Process has a base priority. Each thread has a base priority that is a
function of its process base priority. A thread's base priority is settable
to:

<UL><LI>1 or 2 points above the process base
<LI>equal to the process base
<LI>1 or 2 points below the process base
<P>
</UL>Priority setting is exposed through the Win32 API. In addition to a base
priority, all threads have a dynamic priority. The dynamic priority is
never less than the base priority. The system raises and lowers the dynamic
priority of a thread as needed.
<P>
All scheduling is done strictly by priority. The scheduler chooses the
highest priority thread which is ready to run. On a multi-processor (MP)
system, the highest N runnable threads run (where N is the number of
processors). The thread priority used to make these decisions is the
dynamic priority of the thread.
<P>
When a thread is scheduled, it is given a quantum of time in which to run.
The quantum is in units of clock ticks. The system currently uses 2 units
of quantum (10ms on r4000 and 15ms on x86).
<P>
When a thread is caught running during the clock interrupt, its quantum is
decremented by one. If the quantum goes to zero and the thread's dynamic
priority is not at the base priority, the thread's dynamic priority is
decremented by one and the thread's quantum is replenished. If a priority
change occurs, then the scheduler locates the highest priority thread which
is ready to run. Otherwise, the thread is placed at the end of the run
queue for it's priority allowing threads of equal priority to be "round
robin" scheduled. The above is a description of what is usually called
priority decay, or quantum and priority decay.
<P>
When a thread voluntarily waits (an an event, for I/O, etc), the system
will usually raise the thread's dynamic priority when it resumes.
Internally, each wait type has an associated priority boost. For example, a
wait associated with disk I/O has a one point dynamic boost. A wait
associated with a keyboard I/O has a 5 point dynamic boost. In most cases,
this boost will raise the priority of the thread such that it can be
scheduled very soon afterwards, if not immediately.
<P>
There are other circumstances under which priority will be raised. For
example, whenever a window receives input (timer messages, mouse move
messages, etc), an appropriate boost is given to all threads within the
process that owns the window. This is the boost that allows a thread to
reshape the mouse pointer when the mouse moves over a window.
<P>
By default, the foreground application has a base process priority that is
one point higher than the background application. This allows the
foreground process to be even more responsive. This can be changed by
bringing up the System applet, selecting the Tasking button, and choosing a
different option.
