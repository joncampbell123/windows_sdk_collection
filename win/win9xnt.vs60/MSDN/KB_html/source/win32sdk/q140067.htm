<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article explains how to obtain the version number for Video for
Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Using the GetVersionEx() Function</h3>
 
<P>
Video for Windows has been incorporated into Windows 95 and Windows NT
version 3.51. Therefore, 32-bit applications should call the GetVersionEx()
function to determine the version of the operating system and consequently
the version of the multimedia system that is installed. GetVersionEx()
returns extended information about the version of the operating system that
is currently running.
<P>
<P><h3>Using the VideoForWindowsVersion() Function</h3>
 
<P>
16-bit applications (for example, those compiled with Visual C++ version
1.5x) should call the VideoForWindowsVersion() function to determine the
version of Video for Windows that is installed. The
VideoForWindowsVersion() function is not documented in the Video for
Windows Development Kit. However, many of the samples from the kit use this
function, and it is defined in the multimedia header files. The function is
exported by Msvideo.dll, which is usually located in the Windows\System
directory.
<P>
This function may be used to retrieve the major and minor versions of the
currently installed Video for Windows system under Windows 3.x. For
example, the following code fragment verifies that Video for Windows
version 1.1 or higher is currently running:
<P>
WORD   wVer;
<P>
<PRE>// First make sure you are running version 1.1 or later
</PRE>wVer = HIWORD(VideoForWindowsVersion());
if (wVer &lt; 0x010a)
{
<PRE>   // oops, too old
   MessageBox(NULL, "Video for Windows version is too old",
              "Error", MB_OK | MB_ICONSTOP);
   return FALSE;
</PRE>}
<P>
NOTE: As stated in the Win32 SDK, this function is obsolete in Windows
NT and Windows 95. The GetVersion() or GetVersionEx() functions should
be used on these platforms rather than VideoForWindowsVersion().
<P>
Here is an excerpt from the Win32 SDK "Multimedia, Introduction,
Multimedia Possibilities, Version Checking" documentation:
<P>
<PRE>   You may need to check the installed version of the multimedia
   system, particularly if your application takes advantage of
   features that were not available in previous releases. Although
   the multimedia header files contain two version-checking functions,
   they are obsolete. These obsolete functions are mmsystemGetVersion
   and VideoForWindowsVersion. Your application should rely on the
   standard Windows functions, GetVersion or GetVersionEx, instead.

</PRE><h3>Using the MCI String</h3>
 
<P>
The Multimedia Control Interface (MCI) string "info avivideo version"
should not be used to determine the installed version of Video for Windows.
This string is only meant to be displayed; it is not meant to be used for
version comparison. It will become obsolete in the future.
