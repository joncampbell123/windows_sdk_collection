<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) versions 3.0 and 3.1

<LI>Microsoft Win32 Application Programming Interface (API) included with:

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
A Microsoft Windows edit control aligns its contents to the left or right
margins, or centers its contents, depending on the window style of the
control. The control styles ES_LEFT, ES_CENTER, and ES_RIGHT specify left-,
center-, and right-alignment, respectively.
<P>
Only multiline edit controls can be right-aligned or centered. Single-line
edit controls are always left-aligned, regardless of the control style
given.
<P>
Windows does not support altering the alignment style of a multiline edit
control after it has been created. However, there are two methods that you
can use to cause a multiline edit control in a dialog box to appear to
change alignment. Note that in each of these methods, the dialog box that
contains the control must be created with the DS_LOCALEDIT style.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The first method applies to all platforms. The second method does not apply
to Windows 95. Under Windows 95, EM_SETHANDlE and EM_GETHANDLE are not
supported. For more information, please see the following articles in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : EM_SETHANDLE and EM_GETHANDLE Messages Not Supported

</PRE><h3>Method 1</h3>
 
<P>
Create three controls: one left-aligned, one centered, and one right-
aligned. Each has the same dimensions and position in the dialog box, but
only one is initially made visible.
<P>
When the alignment is to change, call ShowWindow() to hide the visible
control and to make one of the other controls visible.
<P>
To keep the text identical in all three controls, use the EM_GETHANDLE and
EM_SETHANDLE messages to share the same memory among all three controls.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 2</h3>
 
<P>
Initially create a single control. When the text alignment is to change,
retrieve location, size, and style bits for the existing edit control.
Create a new control with the same size and in the same location, but
change the style bits to reflect the new alignment.
<P>
Send the EM_GETHANDLE to each control to retrieve a handle to the memory
that stores the contents. Send an EM_SETHANDLE to each control to exchange
the memory used by each. Finally, destroy the original control.
<P>
There is a sample application named EDALIGN in the Microsoft Software
Library that demonstrates each of these methods. Note, however, that this
sample is a Windows 3.1 sample only.
