The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Win32 Application Programming Interface (API) included with:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Microsoft Windows NT version 3.51
    - Microsoft Windows 95 version 4.0
    - Microsoft Win32s version 1.3
</UL></PRE>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Although the current Win32 documentation does not specifically indicate
this, it is possible (and very likely) that the WM_ACTIVATEAPP message
will be received by an application with the lParam equal to 0. You can
in fact get 0 in lParam when activating and deactivating.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In previous versions of Windows, activation and deactivation used to be
synchronous. This meant that you could never switch away from an
application that was locked up because the application becoming active had
to wait for a synchronous reply from the application being deactivated. The
activating application would get stuck waiting for the deactivating
application to process and return from the WM_ACTIVATEAPP, WM_ACTIVATE, and
WM_NCACTIVATE messages.
<P>
In Windows 95 and Windows NT, Microsoft removed every place where these
types of synchronous lockups can occur. When asynchronous activation
occurs, the activating application becomes active immediately, and the
messages to the deactivating application occur later. This means two
things:

<UL><LI>An application can be terminated in the middle of this process. If this
   happens, the thread ID/task handle that is passed in the lParam is
   invalid.

<LI>When the deactivated application gets notified, it is possible that the
   activated application is no longer active. A third application might
   have been activated in the interim.
