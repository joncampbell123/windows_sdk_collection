<UL><LI>Microsoft Win32 Software Development Kit for:

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The GLLight sample provides a demonstration of how the various light
settings effect an OpenGL scene. The initial scene is simply a single white
sphere with a single blue light (GL_LIGHT0) shining on it.
<P>
You can modify all of the properties of that light as well as the light
model characteristics for the scene to observe the visual effect. GLLight
does not use multiple lights and does not allow you to change the material
properties of the sphere.
<P>
The GLLight sample is included in GLLT.EXE, a self-extracting file, which
can be found on these services:

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
GLLight allows you to experiment with all of the OpenGL lighting
capabilities for a single-light scene quickly and easily. These
characteristics fall into the following categories seen in the "Settings"
dialog box:
<P>
<PRE>   Characteristics of the Light Source (GL_LIGHT0):
     Position
     Intensity (ambient, diffuse, specular)
     Spotlight Properties (exponent, cutoff)
     Attenuation (constant, linear, quadratic)

   Characteristics of the Lighting Model:
     Global ambient light
     Viewpoint (local or infinite)
     Lighting (one-sided or two-sided)

</PRE>The initial settings for these characteristics follow the defaults for
GL_LIGHT0 with two exceptions: the Position is moved back so as to light
the sphere; and the Diffuse Intensity is set to blue.
<P>
The material properties of the sphere are left as defaults except for a
white Specular reflectance and a medium Shininess setting. You cannot
modify the material properties through the UI in this sample.
<P>
To demonstrate the effects of one-sided vs. two-sided lighting, there is an
option to place a clipping plane through the sphere in order to uncover the
inside of it. To see the difference between the inside and outside more
clearly, you should move the light some distance along the x or y axes.
<P>
