<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article discusses the CREATOR_OWNER and CREATOR_GROUP security
identifiers (SID) and how they affect security.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When logged on, each user is represented by a token object. This token
contains all the SIDs comprising your security context. Tokens identify
one of those SIDs as a default owner for any new objects the user creates,
such as files, processes, events, and so forth. Typically, this is the
user's account (&lt;domain&gt;\&lt;username&gt;). For an administrator however, the
default owner is set to be the local group "Administrators," rather than
the individual's user account.
<P>
Each token also identifies a primary group for the user. This group does
not necessarily have to be one the user is a member of (although it is by
default) and it does not determine the objects a user has access to (that
is, it isn't used in access validation decisions). However, by default it
is assigned as the primary group of any objects the user creates. For the
most part, the primary group is required simply for POSIX compatibility,
but the primary group does play a role in object creation.
<P>
When a new object is created, the security system has the task of
assigning protection to the new object. The system follows this process:

<OL><P><LI>Assign the new object any protection explicitly passed in by the
   object creator.

<P><LI>Otherwise, assign the new object any inheritable protection from the
   container the object is created in.

<P><LI>Otherwise, assign the new object any protection explicitly passed in by
   the object creator, but marked as "default."

<P><LI>Otherwise, if the caller's token has a default DACL, that will be
   assigned to the new object.

<P><LI>Otherwise, no protection is assigned to the new object.
<P>
</OL>In step 2, if the parent container has inheritable access-control entries
(ACE), those are used to generate protection for the new object. In this
case, each ACE is evaluated to see if it should be copied to the new
object's protection. Usually, when an ACE is copied, the SID within that
ACE is copied as is. The two exceptions to this rule are when CREATOR_OWNER
and CREATOR_GROUP are encountered. In this case, the SID is replaced with
the caller's default owner SID or primary group SID.
<P>
By default, users logging on to Windows NT are given a primary group of
"Domain Users" (when logging on to a Windows NT Server) or the group called
"None" (when logging onto a Windows NT Workstation system). Therefore, when
you create an object in a container that has an inheritable ACE with the
CREATOR_GROUP SID, you will likely end up with an ACE granting Domain Users
some access. This may not be what you intended.
