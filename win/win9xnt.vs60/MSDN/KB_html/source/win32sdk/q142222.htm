The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Win32 Software Development Kit (SDK) for
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Microsoft Windows NT version 3.51
    - Microsoft Windows 95 version 4.0
</UL></PRE> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Winhlp32.exe, you may encounter the following error when you click the
Find tab in the Help Topics dialog box:
<P>
<PRE>   Unable to display the Find tab. (177)

</PRE>This error may occur immediately upon clicking the Find tab, or it may
occur just after the word list has been built (during the first time the
help file is run).
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The cause of this error depends on when it occurs. If it occurs immediately
upon clicking the Find tab, the problem may be an old or corrupted .gid
file. Normally, when help is started for the first time, it builds the Full
Text Search database (.fts) and the index file (.gid). However, if a .gid
file already exists in the current directory, help may become confused and
display the error message when the Find tab is clicked.
<P>
If the error message occurs immediately after the word list has been built,
the problem is most likely due to help attempting to index a help file that
contains no keywords. This can happen if a helpfile is referenced by way of
an Index command in a contents file (.cnt) and that helpfile has no K
footnotes.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
If the problem is due to a damaged or corrupted .gid file, delete the
existing .gid and .fts files and re-launch the help file. Note that the
.gid file is a hidden file that resides in the same directory as the help
file.
<P>
If the problem is due to indexing a help file that contains no keywords,
either remove the help file from the index entirely or use the Link command
in the contents (.cnt) file to reference the help file. If you are unsure
whether or not a help file has keywords in it, you can either search the
.rtf files for K footnotes, or you can use the reporting mechanism in Help
Workshop. To do the latter, click Report on the File menu, specify the help
file to search, specify a file to output the results to, and choose K
keywords for Display options. This gives you a list of all of the keywords
in the specified helpfile.
