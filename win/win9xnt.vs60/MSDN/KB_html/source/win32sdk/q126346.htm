The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Win32 Device Development Kit (DDK) for Windows NT
   version 3.5
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Packets between the TCP, UDP, and IP layers are lost.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
There appears to be a problem with a race condition between two threads
that share a socket where one is closing a socket while the other tries to
call recvfrom() on the same socket. This causes problems the next time a
socket is bound to the same UDP port.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
The vendor should implement a workaround within the application so that
this race condition does not occur.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This Sockets/UDP problem was discovered while testing the TX1000 NCPI
driver for Windows NT. Here are some notes showing what appears to be
happening:
<P>
<PRE>Thread 1                        Thread 2
--------                        ---------
</PRE>Create DGRAM socket x
Bind socket x to:
<PRE>        IPADDR = ANY
        PORT = 1571
</PRE>Create thread 2 -----------------&gt;
<PRE>                                RecvFrom on socket x
                                ...
                                Packet received on x (recvfrom completes)
                &lt;---------------signal main thread
Process rec'd packet            wait for main thread to consume buffer
</PRE>Signal buffer available---------&gt;
<PRE>                                RecvFrom on socket x
                                ...  { repeats many times }

</PRE><h3>Normal Shutdown Sequence (on Last Packet)</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>                                Packet received on x (recvfrom completes)
                &lt;---------------signal main thread
Process rec'd packet            wait for main thread to consume buffer
</PRE>Signal buffer available---------&gt;
<PRE>Application done                (1) RecvFrom on socket x
</PRE>(2) close socket x
<PRE>                                (3) RecvFrom fails with expected error
                                Thread terminates

</PRE>Usually, events occur in sequence (1, 2, then 3). In this normal case, the
socket is cleared correctly, and everything works the next time the
application runs.
<P>
<P><h3>Shutdown Sequence that Causes Problems (on Last Packet)</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>                                Packet received on x (recvfrom completes)
                &lt;---------------signal main thread
Process rec'd packet            wait for main thread to consume buffer
</PRE>Signal buffer available---------&gt;
Application done
<PRE>(1) close socket x              (2) RecvFrom on socket x
                                (3) RecvFrom fails with expected error
                                Thread terminates

</PRE>In this case, the sequence is slightly different. The closesocket()
function from main thread starts, but does not complete, before thread 2
runs. While thread 1 is suspended awaiting completion of closesocket(),
thread 2 runs and posts next recvfrom() on same socket. The closesocket()
function completes successfully, and recvfrom() fails as in normal case.
But the next time the application runs and binds to the same UDP port, the
following occurs:

<UL><LI>All socket calls (bind(), recvfrom()) are successful

<LI>All incoming packets to that UDP port are discarded before reaching the
   application -- recvfrom() never completes. The following command shows
   that the "receive errors" count has been incremented once for each
   incoming packet that was lost:
<P>
   netstat -s -p udp
<P>
</UL>The conclusion is that in this case the socket was not cleaned up properly
due to the race condition between the closesocket() and the recvfrom()
functions.
