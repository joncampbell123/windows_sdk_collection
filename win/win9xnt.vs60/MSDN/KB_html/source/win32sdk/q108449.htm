<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article discusses memory management issues such as working set size,
nonpaged pool, and locking pages into physical memory via VirtualLock().
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Working Set</h3>
 
<P>
A process's working set is the set of pages that it has currently in
memory. The values for maximum working set and minimum working set are
hard-coded in Windows NT and are thus impossible to change. There are three
values hard-coded for the maximum working set. The value used for maximum
working set depends on whether your machine is considered to be a small,
medium, or large machine:
<P>
<PRE>   Small machine--less than 16 megabytes (MB)
   Medium machine--between 16 MB and 20 MB
   Large machine--greater than 20 MB

</PRE>The system tries to keep about 4 MB free to reduce the paging that occurs
when loading a new process, allocating memory, and so forth. Any free RAM
beyond what the system requires is available for the system to use to
increase your working set size if your process is doing a lot of paging.
<P>
Process pages that are paged out of your process space are moved into the
"standby list," where they remain until sufficient free RAM is available,
or until system memory is low and they need to be reused. If these pages
are accessed by your process while they are still on the standby list and
more RAM has become available, they will be "soft-faulted" back into the
working set. This does not require any disk access, so it is very quick.
Therefore, even though you have an upper limit to the size of your working
set, you can still have quite a few process pages in memory that can be
pulled back into your working set very quickly.
<P>
To minimize working set requirements and increase performance, use the
Working Set Tuner, WST.EXE, to order the functions within your code. One
way to help an application receive a larger working set is to use the
Network application in the Control Panel to set the server configuration to
"Maximize Throughput for Network Applications."
<P>
<P><h3>Nonpaged Pool</h3>
 
<P>
System memory is divided into paged pool and nonpaged pool. Paged pool can
be paged to disk, whereas nonpaged pool is never paged to disk. In Windows
NT 3.1, the default amount of nonpaged pool also depends on whether your
machine is considered small, medium, or large. In other words, you will
have X amount of nonpaged pool on a 16 MB machine, Y amount of nonpaged
pool on a 20 MB machine, and Z amount of nonpaged pool on a machine with
more than 20 MB (the exact values for X, Y, and Z were not made public).
<P>
Important system data is stored in nonpaged pool. For example, each Windows
NT object created requires a block of nonpaged pool. In fact, it is the
availability of nonpaged pool that determines how many processes, threads,
and other such objects can be created. The error that you will receive if
you have too many object handles open is:
<P>
<PRE>   1816 (ERROR_NOT_ENOUGH_QUOTA)

</PRE>Many 3.1 applications ran into this error because of the limited amount of
nonpaged pool. This limit were addressed in Windows NT 3.5. We found that

<UL><LI>Some objects were too large
<LI>Sharing an object caused excessive quota charges
<LI>The quota limits were artificial and fixed
<P>
</UL>The resources used by each object were evaluated and many were drastically
reduced in Windows NT 3.5.
<P>
In Windows NT 3.1, every time an object was shared, quota was charged for
each shared instance. For example, if you opened a file inheritable and
then spawn a process and have it inherit your handle table, the quota
charged for the file object was double. Each handle pointing to an object
cost quota. Most applications experienced this problem. Under Windows NT
3.5, quota is only charged once per object rather than once per handle.
<P>
Windows NT 3.1 had a fixed quota for paged and nonpaged pool. This was
determined by the system's memory size, or could be controlled by the
registry. The limits were artificial. This was due to the poor design of
quotas with respect to sharing. It was also affected by some objects lying
about their actual resource usage. In any case, Windows NT 3.5 has revised
this scheme.
<P>
The Windows NT 3.1 "Resource Kit, Volume I" documents that it is possible
to change the amount of nonpaged pool by modifying the following registry
entry:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\
      CurrentControlSet\
      Control\
      Session Manager\
      Memory Management\
      NonPagedPoolSize

</PRE>WARNING: This modification can cause the system to crash, and therefore
Microsoft does not recommend that this registry entry be changed.
<P>
Quotas can still be controlled in Windows NT 3.5 using these Windows NT 3.1
registry values. However, this technique is now almost never needed. The
new quota mechanism dynamically raises and lowers your quota limits as you
bump into the limits. Before raising a limit, it coordinates this with the
memory manager to make sure you can safely have your limit raised without
using up all of the systems resources.
<P>
<P><h3>VirtualLock()</h3>
 
<P>
To lock a particular page into memory so that it cannot be swapped out to
disk, use VirtualLock(). The documentation for VirtualLock() states the
following:
<P>
<PRE>   Locking pages into memory may degrade the performance of the system by
   reducing the available RAM and forcing the system to swap out other
   critical pages to the paging file. There is a limit on the number of
   pages that can be locked: 30 pages. The limit is intentionally small to
   avoid severe performance degradation.

</PRE>There is no way to raise this limit in Windows NT 3.1--it is fixed at 30
pages (the size of your working set). The reason that you see a severe
performance degradation when an application locks these pages is that
Windows NT must reload all locked pages whenever there is a context switch
to this application. Windows NT was designed to minimize page swapping, so
it is often best to let the system handle swapping itself, unless you are
writing a device driver that needs immediate access to memory.
<P>
Windows NT 3.5 allows processes to increase their working set size by using
SetProcessWorkingSetSize(). This API is also useful to trim your minimum
working set size if you want to run many processes at once, because each
process has the default minimum working set size reserved, no matter how
small the process actually is. The limit of 30 pages does not apply to
VirtualLock() when using SetProcessWorkingSetSize().
