The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows
   version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Win32 SDK, versions 3.1, 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Win32s version 1.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article documents the resources necessary to do Winsock development on
the different Microsoft Windows platforms. The key components necessary for
Winsock programming are:

<UL><LI>TCP/IP networking support
<LI>A Windows Sockets include file
<LI>A Windows Wockets import library
<LI>The Windows Sockets Architecture specification.
<P>
</UL>NOTE: Some implementations of Windows Sockets may support additional
protocols, and TCP/IP will not be strictly necessary. See the documentation
from your vendor for more information.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Where you get the necessary components for Winsock programming depends on
what platform you are using.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Windows NT Versions 3.1 and 3.5 and Windows 95</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>Header filename:     WINSOCK.H
</PRE>Import library name: WSOCK32.LIB
<P>
If you are using Microsoft Windows NT version 3.1 or 3.5, the TCP/IP
protocol is provided as a component of the operating system. Please see
your operating system documentation for more information about installing
TCP/IP support for Microsoft Windows NT.
<P>
The Winsock header file, import library, and specification are all supplied
as part of the Win32 SDK. If you do not have the Win32 SDK, it can be
purchased as part of the Microsoft Developer Network Level 2 subscription.
<P>
The header file and import library are also supplied with the 32-bit
editions of Visual C++. Visual C++ does not include the Windows Sockets
specification.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups Version 3.11</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>Header filename:     WINSOCK.H
</PRE>Import library name: WINSOCK.LIB
<P>
Windows for Workgroups does not include support for the TCP/IP protocol.
However, Microsoft does provide a TCP/IP protocol for Windows for
Workgroups free of charge. To learn how to obtain the TCP/IP package for
Windows for Workgroups, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../win3x/q111682.htm">Q111682</A></B>
   TITLE     : WFWG 3.11: How to Obtain Microsoft DLC and Microsoft TCP/IP

</PRE>The Winsock include file, import library, and specification are available
from the Microsoft Software library. Download WSA16.EXE, a self-extracting
file, from the Microsoft Library (MSL) on the following services:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Download Service (MSDL)
<P><PRE>      Dial (206) 936-6735 to connect to MSDL
      Download <A href="http://support.microsoft.com/download/support/mslfiles/wsa16.exe">WSA16.EXE</A> <I>(size: 168644 bytes)</I> 
</PRE>
<LI>Internet (anonymous FTP)
<P><PRE>      ftp ftp.microsoft.com
      Change to the /softlib/mslfiles directory
      get WSA16.EXE
</PRE><P>
</UL>The header file and library for Winsock programming are not included with
Visual C++ for Windows.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Windows Versions 3.0, 3.1, and 3.11</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>Header filename:     Probably WINSOCK.H (determined by vendor)
</PRE>Import library name: Probably WINSOCK.LIB (determined by vendor)
<P>
TCP/IP support on these versions of Microsoft Windows will have to come
from the underlying network. Your network vendor can tell you what TCP/IP
support is available.
<P>
Depending on your network and the TCP/IP implementation, you may also need
to get the Winsock header and library files from your vendor. However,
while not guaranteed, the files supplied in WSA16.EXE (see above) may work
on your implementation.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Win32s Version 1.2</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>Header filename:     WINSOCK.H
</PRE>Import library name: WSOCK32.LIB
<P>
A Winsock application running on Win32s will use the networking support of
the underlying system. See the appropriate section above for information
about TCP/IP support on the host platform.
<P>
The header file, import library, and specification will be part of the
Win32 SDK from which the Win32s application was created. See the section on
Windows NT above for more information.
