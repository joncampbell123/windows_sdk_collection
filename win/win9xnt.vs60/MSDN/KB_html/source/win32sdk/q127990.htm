The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Win32 Application Programming Interface (API) included with:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Microsoft Windows NT version 3.5
</UL></PRE> 
<P>
There are two ways to delete registry keys: use REGEDT32.EXE or call
RegDeleteKey() from your application.
<P>
The documentation for RegDeleteKey() points out that the specified key to
be deleted must not have subkeys. If the key to be deleted does have
subkeys, RegDeleteKey() will fail with access denied. This happens despite
the fact that the machine account has delete privileges and the registry
handle passed to RegDeleteKey() was opened with delete access. The
additional requirement is that the key must have no subkeys.
<P>
This limitation does not exist in 16-bit Windows. The difference exists in
Windows NT because of atomicity and security considerations that 16-bit
Windows does not have.
<P>
You can select a key with subkeys and delete it with REGEDT32. This is
because REGEDT32 recursively deletes the subkeys for you, making multiple
call to RegDeleteKey(). You should use recursive subkey deletion in your
application as well, if you need to delete keys that have subkeys.
