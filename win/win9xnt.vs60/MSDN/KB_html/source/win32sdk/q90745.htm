<UL><LI>Microsoft Win32 Application Programming Interface (API) included with:
<P>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When using LoadLibrary() under Win16 or OS/2, the Dynamic Link Library
(DLL) is loaded only once. Therefore, the DLL has the same address in all
processes. Dynamic loading of DLLs is different under Windows NT.
<P>
A DLL is loaded separately for each process because each application has
its own address space, unlike Win16 and OS/2. Pages must be mapped into the
address space of a process. Therefore, it is possible that the DLL is
loaded at different addresses in different processes. The memory manager
optimizes the loading of DLLs so that if two processes share the same pages
from the same image, they will share the same physical memory.
<P>
Each DLL has a preferred base address, specified at link time. If the
address space from the base address to the base address plus image size is
unavailable, then the DLL is loaded elsewhere and fixups will be applied.
There is no way to specify a load address at load time.
<P>
To summarize, at load time the system:

<OL><P><LI>Examines the image and determines its preferred base address and
   required size.

<P><LI>Finds the address space required and maps the image, copy-on-write,
   from the file.

<P><LI>Applies internal fixups if the image isn't at its preferred base.

<P><LI>Fixes up all dynamic link imports by placing the correct address for
   each imported function in the appropriate entry of the Import Address
   Table. This table is contiguous with 32-bit addresses, so 1024 imports
   require dirtying only one page.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The pages containing code are shared, using a copy-on-write scheme. The
term copy-on-write means that the pages are read-only; however, when a
process writes the page, instead of an access violation, the memory manager
makes a private copy of the page and allows the write to proceed. For
example, if two processes start from the same .EXE, both initially have all
pages mapped from the .EXE copy-on-write. As the two processes proceed to
modify pages, they get their own copies of the modified pages. The memory
manager is free to optimize unmodified pages and actually map the same
physical memory into the address space of both processes. Modified pages
are swapped to/from the page file instead of the .EXE file.
<P>
There are two kinds of fixups. One is the address of an imported function.
All these fixups are localized in what the Portable Executable (PE)
specification calls the Import Address Table (IAT). This is an array of 32-
bit function pointers, one for each imported API. The IAT is located on its
own page(s), because it is always modified. Calling an imported function is
actually an indirect call through the appropriate entry in this array. In
case that the image is loaded at the preferred address, the only fixups
needed are for imports.
<P>
Note that there is an optimization whereby each import library exports a 32-
bit number for each API along with any name and ordinal. This serves as a
"hint" to speed the fixups performed at load time. If the hints in the
program and the DLL do not match, the loader uses a binary search by name.
<P>
The other kind of fixup is needed for references to the image's own code or
data when the image can't be loaded at its preferred address. When a page
must be taken out of memory, the system checks to see whether the page has
been modified. If it has not, then the page is still mapped copy-on-write
against the EXE and can be discarded from memory. Otherwise, it must be
written to the page file before it can be removed from memory, so that the
page file is used as the backing store (where the page is recovered from)
rather than the executable image file.
<P>
<P><h2>NOTES</h2>
 
<P>
The DLL's entry point does not get called for a second LoadLibrary() call
in a process (that is, no second DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH entry). There is one
call to DllEntry/DLL_THREAD_ATTACH per thread no matter the number of times
a thread calls LoadLibrary(). The same goes for FreeLibrary(), but the
DLL_PROCESS_DETACH happens only on the last call (that is, reference count
back to zero for the process).
<P>
Global instance data for the DLL is on a per process basis (only one set
per unique process). If it is necessary to ensure that global instance data
is unique for each LoadLibrary() performed in a single process, consider
thread local storage (TLS) as an alternative. This requires multiple
threads of execution, but TLS allows unique data for each ThreadID. There
is very little overhead on the DLL's part; just create a global TLS index
during process initialization. During thread initialization, allocate
memory (via HeapAlloc(), GlobalAlloc(), LocalAlloc(), malloc(), and so on)
and store a pointer to the memory using the global TLS index value in the
function TlsSetValue. Win32 internally stores each thread's pointer by TLS
index and ThreadID to achieve the thread specific storage.
