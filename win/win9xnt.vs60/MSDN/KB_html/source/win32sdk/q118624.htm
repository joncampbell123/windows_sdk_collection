The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Win32 Application Programming Interface (API) included with:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Microsoft Windows NT versions 3.1 and 3.5
</UL></PRE> 
<P>
GetForegroundWindow() is documented to return the handle of the foreground
window, that is, the window that the user is currently working with. The
proper handle is returned when the desktop that the application is running
on is active; however, when another desktop is active,
GetForegroundWindow() returns NULL.
<P>
This is expected behavior. There is no way to get the active window in your
own desktop while another desktop is active.
<P>
The application desktop is one desktop. Other desktops include the logon
and screen saver desktops. If GetForegroundWindow() returned a handle to
the logon dialog box, it would be possible to create an application that
could get user passwords. This would violate Windows NT security.
<P>
For this reason, it is not possible to create screen savers that melt
or drop out.
