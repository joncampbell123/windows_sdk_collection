The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Win32 Application Programming Interface (API) included with:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Microsoft Windows 95 version 4.0
</UL></PRE> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The colors used in the gray, white, and black rectangle static controls has
changed in Windows 95. In previous versions of Windows, these colors were
based on the system colors for windows. In Windows 95, these colors are
based on the colors for 3D objects.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In Windows 95, the definitions for white, gray, and black rectangle static
controls are as follows:

<UL><LI>SS_WHITERECT: Specifies a rectangle filled with the highlight color for
   three-dimensional display elements (for edges facing the light source).
   This is the same color retrieved by using GetSysColor() with
   COLOR_3DHILIGHT.

<LI>SS_GRAYRECT: Specifies a rectangle filled with the shadow color for
   three-dimensional display elements (for edges facing away from the light
   source). This is the same color retrieved by using GetSysColor() with
   COLOR_3DSHADOW.

<LI>SS_BLACKRECT: Specifies a rectangle filled with the Shadow color for
   three-dimensional display elements (for edges facing away from the light
   source). This is the same color retrieved by using GetSysColor() with
   COLOR_3DDKSHADOW. This is not the same color as COLOR_3DSHADOW. There
   are two shadow colors used on 3D objects.
<P>
</UL>In previous versions of Windows, the definitions for white, gray, and
black rectangle static controls were as follows:

<UL><LI>SS_WHITERECT: Specifies a rectangle filled with the color used to fill
   window backgrounds. This color is white in the default Windows color
   scheme. This is the same color retrieved by using GetSysColor() with
   COLOR_WINDOW.

<LI>SS_GRAYRECT: Specifies a rectangle filled with the color used to fill
   the screen background. This color is gray in the default Windows color
   scheme. This is the same color retrieved by using GetSysColor() with
   COLOR_BACKGROUND.

<LI>SS_BLACKRECT: Specifies a rectangle filled with the color used to draw
   window frames. This color is black in the default Windows color scheme.
   This is the same color retrieved by using GetSysColor() with
   COLOR_WINDOWFRAME.
