The information in this article applies to:

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The LOGGING sample, found in the Win32 Software Development Kit (SDK) under
the Q&amp;A sample tree, provides a full example of Event Logging in Microsoft
Windows NT. This article gives an overview of the process to create and
install a message source for Event Viewer.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The LOGGING sample that demonstrates Event Logging is found in the Win32
SDK in:
<P>
<PRE>   \mstools\samples\q_a\logging

</PRE>The logging sample includes a DLL and an EXE. The DLL provides the source
for event log messages and the EXE demonstrates reporting events in the log
and displaying log messages.
<P>
The following is the procedure to create and install a message source:

<OL><P><LI>Use a text editor to create message compiler source (.MC) file. All of
   the information regarding the layout of a message compiler source file
   is provided in the MESSAGES.MC file in its comments in the LOGGING
   sample.

<P><LI>Compile the .MC file using the MC.EXE, message compiler utility. This
   utility takes the information from the .MC file and creates three output
   files, .RC, .BIN, and .H files. The .RC file is to be compiled into the
   message source DLL, or whatever module you choose to provide a message
   source for Event Viewer. The .RC file creates a single resource, a
   message table with an ID of 1. The .BIN file is the binary form of the
   compiled message table data. The .RC file refers to the .BIN file for
   the source of data to create a message table resource. The .H file is
   created so that your event reporting application can refer to the event
   messages by symbolic name.

<P><LI>Compile the message source module. In the LOGGING sample makefile, the
   resource compiler uses the .RC and .BIN file to create a .RES file. The
   .RES file is the sole object for the linker to create the MESSAGES.DLL
   file. Alternatively, if the message table resource is to be bound to an
   EXE or DLL that contains executable code, the .RES filename is added to
   the list of other objects during the link process of making the EXE or
   DLL.

<P><LI>Create a registry key in the EventLog registry. The event log message
   source is registered in:
<P>
<P><PRE>      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\
<PRE></PRE>         SYSTEM\
         CurrentControlSet\
         Services\
         EventLog\
         Application

</PRE></OL>It is best for an application to programmatically create the registry key
for the message source. The application can do this during initialization
or during application installation. The LOGGING sample demonstrates how to
create the registry key during application initialization.
<P>
The following diagram illustrates the build process and the components:

   | .mc  |--&gt; mc.exe --&gt;| .bin |-----+
   |      |              |      | .rc |-----+
   +------+              +------+     | .h  |
                            |  +------+     |
                            |    |   +------+
                            |   /       |
                            |  /         \
       +------+             v v           v
       | .res |&lt;--------- rc.exe        your app source
       |      |
       +------+
          |                      +------+
          +-----&gt; link.exe ----&gt; | .dll |
                                 |      |
                                 +------+



</PRE>It is up to you to include the .H file in your application that posts
events into the event log with ReportEvent. The .DLL is the module that
Event Viewer loads to associate strings with the event IDs it reads from
the event log.
