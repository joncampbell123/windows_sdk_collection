The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Win32 Application Programming Interface (API) included with:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Microsoft Windows NT versions 3.1 and 3.5
</UL></PRE> 
<P>
When starting an application from File Manager by double-clicking a
document associated with the application, if the document resides on an
NTFS partition and has a long (non-8.3 form) filename, File Manager will
pass the short version of the filename (also known as the MS-DOS alias or
8.3 name) to the associated application if the application is an MS-DOS or
16-bit Windows-based application. This is done for compatibility reasons;
applications not aware of long filenames (16-bit Windows-based
applications) can still function correctly. 32-bit Windows-based
applications will be passed the long file name.
<P>
This can create confusion, however, if the application displays the name of
the file the application was started with; the short name is displayed even
though the long name was double-clicked.
<P>
You can avoid possible confusion by always expanding any filenames passed
to an application via the command line. Do this by calling the
FindFirstFile() application programming interface (API) on these filenames.
FindFirstFile() will always return the file system's version of the
filename in the WIN32_FIND_DATA.cFileName structure member, which the
application can then use in all further references to the file without any
problems.
