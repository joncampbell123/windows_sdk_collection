The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows
   version 3.1

<LI>Microsoft Win32 Application Programming Interface (API) included with:

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Most drawing software uses what is termed a "rubber rectangle". This term
is used to describe the situation where

<OL><P><LI>the left mouse button is held down, defining one corner of the
   rectangle

<P><LI>the mouse is dragged and released at the point defining the opposite
   corner of the rectangle

<P><LI>the rectangle is drawn while the mouse is being dragged, so that it
   looks like the rectangle is being stretched and contracted, like a
   rubber band
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The key to making this work is in the following call, which should be
made in the WM_LBUTTONDOWN case:
<P>
<PRE>   SetROP2( hDC, R2_NOT )

</PRE></OL>On each WM_MOUSEMOVE message, the rectangle is redrawn in its previous
position. Because of the ROP code, the rectangle appears to be erased. The
new position for the rectangle is calculated and then the rectangle is
drawn.
<P>
Note that Windows will only let you draw in the invalid area of the window
if you use a DC returned from BeginPaint(). If you want to use the DC
returned from BeginPaint(), you must first call InvalidateRect() to specify
the region to be updated.
<P>
With the DC returned from GetWindowDC(), Windows will restrict your drawing
to the client and non-client areas. With the hDC returned from CreateDC(),
you can write on the entire display, so you must be careful.
