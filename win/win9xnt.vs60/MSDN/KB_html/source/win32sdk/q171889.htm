The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Win32 Software Development Kit (SDK)
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The MS Enhanced Provider (Rsaenh.dll) will not load under Windows NT 4.0
Service Pack 3.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The MS Enhanced Provider requires that you load and use a signature which
is stored in the registry. There is a bug in Domestic Windows NT 4.0
Service Pack 3 in that the signature for the MS Enhanced Provider is not
put in the registry during setup. In addition, another required registry
entry is incorrect in Service Pack 3.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
The file Rsaenh.reg is used in conjunction with Regedit.exe to fix a
problem with the MS Enhanced Provider (Rsaenh.dll) that does not load under
Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3. It can be obtained via the following self-
extracting executable files, Rsax86.exe (x86 platform) or Rsaalpha.exe
(Alpha platform).
<P>
The following files are available for download from the Microsoft
Software Library:
<P>
<PRE> ~ <A href="http://support.microsoft.com/download/support/mslfiles/rsax86.exe">Rsax86.exe</A> <I>(size: 23243 bytes)</I> 
 ~ <A href="http://support.microsoft.com/download/support/mslfiles/rsaalpha.exe">Rsaalpha.exe</A> <I>(size: 23244 bytes)</I> 

</PRE>For more information about downloading files from the Microsoft Software
Library, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : How to Obtain Microsoft Support Files from Online Services

</PRE>The MS Enhanced Provider (Rsaenh.dll) is a Cryptographic Service Provider
for the Crypto API that implements strong Cryptography (DES, 3DES, 128-bit
RC2 and RC4, and large RSA key exchange keys). Its export is restricted to
North America and, in this case, it is shipped in the Domestic (North
America only) version of Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3.
<P>
To fix this problem, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Make sure that you have downloaded the appropriate file for your
   platform (Rsax86.exe for the X86 platform or Rsaalpha.exe for the
   Alpha platform).

<P><LI>Run the .EXE to extract the Rsaenh.reg file.

<P><LI>Make sure that you are logged on as an administrator.

<P><LI>Go to a DOS window. At the command line type:
<P>
<P><PRE>      regedit rsaenh.reg
</PRE><P>
   The command argument to regedit.exe must be the path of the
   rsaenh.reg file.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed
at the beginning of this article. We are researching this bug and will post
new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
