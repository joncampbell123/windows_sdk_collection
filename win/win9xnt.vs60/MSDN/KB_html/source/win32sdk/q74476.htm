<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The following is excerpted from an article in the April 1991 issue of
Software Design (Japan).
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Asynchronous message-passing means that Windows will send an application
messages to act on and that these messages may come in any order. At
present, all messages are sent to specific windows. Every window has a
function that Windows calls to send that window a message. This function
processes the message and returns to Windows. When the function returns to
Windows, Windows may then send messages to other windows in the same
program, other programs, or to the same window again.
<P>
Because most of these messages are generated by user actions (picking an
item in a menu, moving a window, and so forth), the specific messages a
window receives will differ each time the program is run. This is what
makes the messages asynchronous.
<P>
This message passing is what makes Windows programming difficult for many
programmers. The programmer is no longer writing a program in which he or
she controls the flow from beginning to end. Rather, a Windows program is
written as a large number of objects, each one designed to handle a
specific message from Windows.
<P>
Understanding message passing is critical and because it leads to so much
confusion, the concept will be explained in greater detail in this article.
If message passing is understood, the remainder of Windows can be learned
fairly easily. However, it is very unlikely that a Windows program or other
graphical user interface (GUI) program can be successfully developed
without a thorough understanding of message passing.
<P>
In a message-passing system, the focus changes from being proactive (the
programmer controls the program flow) to being reactive (Windows controls
the program flow). [Or as it has been put by some Macintosh programmers,
"Don't call us, we'll call you."] For example, consider the situation where
a user chooses an action from a menu in a program. In a proactive program,
the program reads the keyboard, determines that the key(s) pressed are
meant to run the action, and calls the function that performs that action.
In a reactive system, the program is sent a message indicating that the
user chose that item from a menu. When the program receives the message, it
calls the function that performs the action. When this function is done,
control returns to the system. Although the reactive approach is
substantially different from the proactive approach, it is also simpler.
<P>
In Windows, every window (including dialog boxes) has a "response function"
registered to it. When Windows sends a message to a window, it calls the
response function for that window and passes it the message. All messages
from Windows are passed to window response functions; there is no other way
for Windows to send a message to a program. Therefore, all messages are for
a specific window or group of windows.
<P>
However, there are four considerations involved with this method:

<OL><P><LI>Messages are sent in two distinct ways. The first method consists
   of messages that are posted to a first-in, first-out queue
   (PostMessage). The second method consists of messages that are sent
   (SendMessage). Posted messages, aside from PAINT messages, are
   serialized, meaning that messages cannot be posted anywhere except
   to the end of the queue, and the application is sent messages only
   from the beginning of the queue. Posted PAINT messages are an
   exception. They are added together and sent only when there is
   nothing else in the queue. This is done to reduce the number of
   times a window has to paint itself.
<P>
   Messages that are sent are passed to the application immediately,
   and the send function does not return until the message is
   processed. However, when a message is posted, an indeterminate
   number of messages and amount of time will pass before the message
   is actually sent to a window and acted on. Also, when a message is
   sent, an message posted earlier may not yet have been acted on.

<P><LI>Sending messages or calling functions (which may, as part of their
   actions, also send messages), can lead to additional messages being
   generated. The most dangerous situation is where the action for a
   message generates the same message again. If, while processing a
   message, an application sends the same message to itself, the
   application will run out of stack space quite quickly. If an
   application POSTS the same message to itself, the application will
   not run out of stack but it will generate an unending stream of
   messages.

<P><LI>If, while processing a message, an application calls a function
   that sends a message, the application will process the second
   message in the middle of processing the first message. Therefore,
   each window response function MUST be fully re-entrant. It is even
   possible for a function to be re-entered to process the same
   message as the message currently being processed. For this reason,
   using global or static variables in a response function is very
   dangerous.
<P>
   Also, if the application uses properties, scratch files and/or
   other data storage mechanisms, extreme caution is required.
   Consider the situation where one message reads in data from a file,
   then a second message reads in the same data, makes changes to that
   data, and writes it back to the file. If the first message makes
   additional changes to the data and writes its new data back to the
   file, the changes caused by the second message are completely lost.
   With files, each application must implement its own sharing
   mechanism. For properties, allocated memory and other memory
   storage, there is a simple solution: lock the item and use the
   pointer returned. Because only one lock is allowed, this prevents
   contention. Never copy the data into a scratch buffer to copy back
   later.

<P><LI>Because messages come in due to user interaction, the application
   cannot be written to assume that when a particular message is
   received that another message has already been processed and
   performed its functions. While, for a given action, a specific
   sequence of messages may occur, in the interest of remaining
   completely compatible with potential changes in future versions of
   Windows, it is recommended that no message ordering dependencies be
   introduced unless absolutely necessary. The best example of this is
   that the first message a window gets when it is being created is
   not WM_CREATE, rather it is WM_GETMINMAXINFO. When one message must
   logically follow a second (such as WM_CREATE always preceding
   WM_DESTROY), then it is fine to depend on the specific ordering of
   those two messages.
<P>
</OL>The asynchronous, reactive nature of Windows programming can cause
confusion. Because the program has no control over the order that
messages arrive, the response to ANY specific message CANNOT depend on
other messages having been processed or NOT been processed.
<P>
To confuse matters even further, an application may be in the middle
of processing one message when it calls a Windows function that sends
the application another message. When processing this second message,
some dependent processing may be only half finished. If an application
will check and only do some processing if another message has not
already performed it, the application must be prepared for the case
where another message has begun the processing, but has not completed
it.
<P>
Further, when an application sets up a modal dialog box, the
DialogBox() function will not return until after the dialog box is
dismissed and processing completed. Therefore, after calling the
dialog box function, all combinations of user-generated messages may
be received before the function returns.
<P>
NOTE: 16-bit Windows is non-preemptively multitasks its Windows tasks.
Therefore, an application generally does not need to be designed to process
a user-originated message in the middle of processing another message.
However, when an application calls a Windows function, the application may
then get a set of specific messages sent to it by Windows before the called
function returns.
<P>
32-bit Windows 95 and Windows NT are preemptive multitasking systems. Each
thread has its own input queue. It is a good idea to create a separate
thread of execution for the user interface so that it is responsive to user
input.
