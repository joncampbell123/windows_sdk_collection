<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
By default, all socket handles are opened as overlapped handles so that
asynchronous I/O can be performed on them. However, in many situations you
may find it preferable to have nonoverlapped (synchronous) socket handles.
<P>
For example, only nonoverlapped handles can be used with the C run-time
libraries or used as standard I/O handles for a process. Under Windows NT
and Windows 95, the SO_OPENTYPE socket option allows an application to open
non-overlapped socket handles.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
There are some Windows Sockets features that you cannot use with
synchronous sockets. Here is an extract from the Winsock Help file:
<P>
<PRE>   The WSAAsyncSelect call cannot be used with synchronous sockets and
   will fail with the error WSAEINVAL. It is also not possible to set the
   SO_SNDTIMEO and SO_RCVTIMEO socket options on synchronous sockets;
   setsockopt with these options on synchronous sockets fails with
   WSAEINVAL as well.

</PRE>Due to the non-preemptive nature of Windows version 3.1 and Windows for
Workgroups version 3.11, the Winsock specification details a mechanism by
which a Winsock application can "yield" processor time. For more
information, please search for WSASetBlockingHook() in the Winsock Help
file.
<P>
NOTE: Use of a blocking hook is not recommended on a 32-bit platform. If a
32-bit application chooses to install a blocking hook, the blocking hook
will be disabled if the application is run under Windows NT, but it will
remain enabled if the application is run under Windows 95.
