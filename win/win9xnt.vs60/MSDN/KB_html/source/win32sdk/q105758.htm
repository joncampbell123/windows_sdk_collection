<P>
Under Windows NT, timers are system objects; as such, they are not owned by
an application. SetTimer() can be called from within one application with a
handle to a window that was created by a different application. This
application would process the WM_TIMER messages in the window procedure.
The timer event will continue to occur even after the application that
created the timer has terminated. Note that it is fairly uncommon for a
Win32-based application to create a timer for another application, but this
method does work.
<P>
Because Win32s runs on top of Windows 3.1 and shares many of its
characteristics, timers are owned by the application that calls SetTimer().
The timer event terminates when the application that owns the timer
terminates.
