</UL><h3>How the Sample Works</h3>
 
<P>
The following discussion is a "walkthrough" of the code.
<P>
The entry point of the sample is the same as any other Windows program,
WinMain(). This function is where all initialization takes place for the
sample. The first initialization registers the window class and creates the
window. After the window is successfully created, the program enters an
infinite message loop until it closes. DirectX programs (particularly
games) should only run when the program has the activation. If it loses
activation, or if the program is paused, the program should just process
Window's messages instead of running the game loop and trying to render.
<P>
There are no differences in registering the window class for a DirectX
program. The sample registers the class with an icon. This icon is used by
Windows to visibly represent the application on the task bar when the
program loses activation with a task switch. No menu is used since the
sample is a full-screen exclusive mode application. After the standard
CreateWindow, ShowWindow, and UpdateWindow calls, the sample initializes
DirectDraw and Direct3D in InitDDrawAndD3D().
<P>
The window callback procedure processes Windows messages. WM_ACTIVATEAPP
must be handled for a "well-behaved" program. When the program loses
activation, set a flag and do not enter the game loop. Let other programs
use the CPU for a while. When the program gains activation, make sure to
restore the program's internal status including DirectX. Hide the Windows
cursor in the WM_SETCURSOR case as described. All DirectDraw programs
should render their own cursor. Do not let Windows handle cursor rendering
unless a flickering cursor is a feature of the program. Determine the
cursor position with GetCursorPos then render your own software cursor. All
the other messages are self-explanatory.
<P>
Initializing DirectDraw and Direct3D can be complex. The sample uses a user-
defined data structure to hold some global information. The keywords for
initialization are "never assume anything about the hardware." Follow these
steps to initialize DirectDraw and Direct3D:

<OL><P><LI>Enumerate all DDraw supported video devices on the system. A system can
   have more than one video card. Use DirectDrawEnumerate to determine
   which is the best video card. In the enumerating callback procedure,
   check which device supports 3D, and then save that information. Make
   sure to enumerate the display mode that the application requires with
   EnumDisplayModes. Notice that this sample doesn't have that code. Do not
   assume that the particular mode that the program requires is supported
   on all devices. If a device does not support the required mode, have an
   alternative plan. Fall back on a different mode, if possible.

<P><LI>The sample tries to use RGB color model. If 3D hardware is used, RGB
   color model is a must. In the case of software HEL, RGB is chosen if the
   processor supports MMX instructions. Note that starting with a DX5, MMX
   system will have two flavors of the RGB driver: the standard one, and an
   MMX enhanced one. The fallback is MONO color model when no acceleration
   is available.

<P><LI>After a IDirect3D interface is queried off of a IDirectDraw interface,
   enumerate the devices supported. This is where you need to check for HW
   support for particular features if HW is to be used. If the program
   requires HW Z-buffer at 16bpp, fog, perspective corrected texturing,
   point lights, etc., then check and make sure.
<P>
   DrawPrimitive and its cousin APIs are methods of the IDirect3DDevice2
   interface. First, get the IDirect3D2 interface by querying for it off of
   the IDirect3D interface. Then, use IDirect3D2::CreateDevice to get to
   IDirect3DDevice2. If the IDirect3DDevice interface is needed, use
   IDirect3DDevice2::QueryInterface.
<P>
   One point that this sample does not go into is the idea of
   enumerating all available devices and letting the user choose. Programs
   should profile the available devices and then display the options
   available to the user and have a default pre-selected.

<P><LI>After all of DirectDraw and Direct3D devices have been enumerated, you
   need to create some surface for the rendering engine. You will need a
   primary surface with one back buffer and a Z buffer. Whether the device
   is HW or SW determines where the Z buffer should be allocated from. If
   it's HW then the Z buffer is allocated from video memory (if the HW
   supports Z buffers). If it's SW, create the surface in system memory.

<P><LI>The last initialization this code performs is querying for the D3DDEVICE
   off the back buffer.
<P>
</OL>The key to this sample is the RenderTriangle function. An array of vertices
is defined for one triangle with vertices at (0, 1, 0), (1, 0, 0), (-1, 0,
0). The normal of each vertex is -1 z, which points away from the monitor.
<P>
Setting up the matrices requires defining the world, view, and projection
matrices, associate them with the IDirect3DDevice by calling
IDirect3DDevice::CreateMatrix and IDirect3DDevice::SetMatrix methods.
<P>
In the SetupLightAndViewport function, a directional light is created and a
viewport is setup to map the 3D world to the visible 2D window.
<P>
To give the triangle and background some visual appeal, it needs to have
colors to define each. D3D materials are used for this purpose. If you use
3D HW acceleration, the color of the triangle will be green. If you use SW,
the color will be red. On DX5, if MMX is detected, the triangle will be
yellow. The background will always be a shade of blue.
<P>
The world, view, and projection transforms are specified with
IDirect3DDevice2::SetTransform.
<P>
Gouraud shade is turned on with IDirect3DDevice2::SetRenderState along with
other D3DRENDERSTATEs.
<P>
After you have created everything, you are ready to render the triangle.
First, clear the viewport and Z-buffer with Clear. Then render the triangle
with BeginScene, DrawPrimitive, and EndScene. Those 4 APIs usually are
called together in that sequence. Make sure to not call SetRenderState with
each frame. This is an expensive operation. If the render state doesn't
change, then apply it once.
<P>
When using DrawPrimitive or DrawIndexedPrimitive, make sure to send as many
triangles in one call as possible (that is, don't call the API for each
triangle). Applications can minimize vertices to optimize for speed by
rearranging a list of triangles to use D3DPT_TRIANGLESTRIP or
D3DPT_TRIANGLEFAN.
<P>
With each frame, the triangle is animated by modifying the world matrix to
apply a rotation around the Y-axis and then making the four rendering
calls:
<P>
<PRE>    IDirect3DViewport::Clear
    IDirect3DDevice2::BeginScene
    IDirect3DDevice2::DrawPrimitive
    IDirect3DDevice2::EndScene

</PRE></OL>Finally, the image is made visible with a call to IDirectDrawSurface::Flip.
<P>
During execution the application may be deactivated and switched away. Make
sure to pause all processing as mentioned earlier. When the application is
activated, restore all surfaces and reload any artwork onto respective
surfaces. The sample doesn't use any textures so IDDrawSurface::Restore is
sufficient.
<P>
When cleaning up, release all objects in the reverse order of creation.
Notice that only the front buffer is released, and that the back and the Z
buffer are not released. Releasing a surface with attached surfaces will
release all attached surfaces.
