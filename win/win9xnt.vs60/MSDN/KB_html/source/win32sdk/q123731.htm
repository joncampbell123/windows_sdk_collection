<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In Win32-based applications, LoadLibrary() returns an HINSTANCE and
GetLastError() is used to determine the error. If HINSTANCE is NULL, the
DLL was not successfully loaded. If the HINSTANCE is not null, the DLL was
loaded and the usage count was incremented; however, you may still see that
the last error was set if the DLL is a 16-bit DLL.
<P>
NOTE: At this point, the DLL is loaded and the usage count is incremented.
Call FreeLibrary() to unload the DLL.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In order to see all possible error returns, you'll need to call
SetLastError(0) before calling LoadLibrary(). If HINSTANCE is not NULL and
GetLastError() is ERROR_BAD_EXE_FORMAT, the DLL is a 16-bit DLL. You can
access the DLL resources and/or printer APIs from your Win32-based
application.
<P>
To call routines in the 16-bit DLL, you should load and call the DLL via
the Universal Thunk. This increments the usage count again. Later, you can
use FreeLibrary() to free the DLL from the 16-bit code, but this won't
unload the DLL from memory unless you already called FreeLibrary() from the
32-bit code. This is because the usage count is not zero. We recommend you
call FreeLibrary() from the 32-bit code after the DLL is loaded by the
16-bit code, so the DLL isn't unloaded and then reloaded.
<P>
