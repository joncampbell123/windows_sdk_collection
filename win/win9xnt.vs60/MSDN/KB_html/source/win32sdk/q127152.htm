<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Sometimes you need an application to display things in terms of a real unit
of measurement such as an inch or millimeter. When dealing with a printer,
resolution is usually given in dots per inch (DPI), which makes it easy to
convert pixels to real inches. However, on a video display, resolution is
given only in pixels. A given video mode will be some X pixels wide with no
information as to the real dimensions of the display area.
<P>
Because there is no way to programmatically determine the real dimensions
of the viewable area on a video display, it is impossible for a program to
determine real output dimensions. Two manual methods for determining real
output dimensions are given in this article.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When output is destined for a printer, the application can call
GetDeviceCaps() using LOGPIXELSX and LOGPIXELSY to determine dots per real
inch. However, for a video display, LOGPIXELSX and LOGPIXELSY are defined
by the video driver and may vary wildly. These numbers define a logical
inch, which is almost never equal to a real inch.
<P>
Applications that need to output real sizes to the video display can use
one of the following two methods for determining output size:

<OL><P><LI>The application can ask the user what size monitor is attached. Using
   this value, an application can approximate the actual viewable area, and
   given the resolution of the output (GetDeviceCaps, HORZRES, VERTRES),
   the application can approximate real inches. This solution gives only an
   approximation of a real inch. Several factors can introduce errors into
   this approximation including the size adjustments on digital monitors.

<P><LI>The application can ask the user to hold a measuring device to the
   screen and measure a given line. This is the only way to guarantee that
   output on a video display is exactly the expected size, and
   recalibration would be necessary after any adjustment to the monitor.
