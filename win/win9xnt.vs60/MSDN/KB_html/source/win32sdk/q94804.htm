<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Thread local storage (TLS) is a method by which each thread in a given
process is given a location(s) in which to store thread-specific data.
<P>
Four functions exist for TLS: TlsAlloc(), TlsGetValue(), TlsSetValue(), and
TlsFree(). These functions manipulate TLS indexes, which refer to storage
areas for each thread in a process. A given index is valid only within the
process that allocated it.
<P>
Note that the Visual C++ compiler supports an alternate syntax:
<P>
<PRE>   _declspec( thread )

</PRE>which can be used in place of directly calling these APIs. Please see the
description of _declspec in the VC++ "Language and Run-time Help" helpfile
for more information.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
A call to TlsAlloc() returns a global TLS index. This one TLS index is
valid for every thread within the process that allocated it, and should
therefore be saved in a global or static variable.
<P>
Thread local storage works as follows: when TlsAlloc() is called, every
thread within the process has its own private DWORD-sized space reserved
for it (in its stack space, but this is implementation-specific). However,
only one TLS index is returned. This single TLS index may be used by each
and every thread in the process to refer to the unique space that
TlsAlloc() reserved for it.
<P>
For this reason, TlsAlloc() is often called only once. This is convenient
for DLLs, which can distinguish between DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH (where the first
process's thread is connecting to the DLL) and DLL_THREAD_ATTACH
(subsequent threads of that process are attaching). For example, the first
thread calls TlsAlloc() and stores the TLS index in a global or static
variable, and every other thread that attaches to the DLL refers to the
global variable to access their local storage space.
<P>
Although one TLS index is usually sufficient, a process may have up to
TLS_MINIMUM_AVAILABLE indexes (guaranteed to be greater than or equal
to 64).
<P>
Once a TLS index has been allocated (and stored), the threads within the
process may use it to set and retrieve values in their storage spaces. A
thread may store any DWORD-sized value in its local storage (for example, a
DWORD value, a pointer to some dynamically allocated memory, and so forth).
The TlsSetValue() and TlsGetValue() APIs are used for this purpose.
<P>
A process should free TLS indexes with TlsFree() when it has finished using
them. However, if any threads in the process have stored a pointer to
dynamically allocated memory within their local storage spaces, it is
important to free the memory or retrieve the pointer to it before freeing
the TLS index, or it will be lost.
<P>
For more information, please see "Using Thread Local Storage" in the
"Processes and Threads" overview in the "Win32 Programmer's Reference".
<P>
<P><h3>Example</h3>
 
<P>
Thread A within a process calls TlsAlloc(), and stores the index returned
in the global variable TlsIndex:
<P>
<PRE>   TlsIndex = TlsAlloc();

</PRE>Thread A then allocates 100 bytes of dynamic memory, and stores it in its
local storage:
<P>
<PRE>   TlsSetValue( TlsIndex, malloc(100) );

</PRE>Thread A creates thread B, which stores a handle to a window in its local
storage space referred to by TlsIndex.
<P>
<PRE>   TlsSetValue( TlsIndex, (LPVOID)hSomeWindow );

</PRE>Note that TlsIndex refers to a different location when thread B uses it,
than when thread A uses it. Each thread has its own location referred to by
the same value in TlsIndex.
<P>
Thread B may terminate safely because it does not need to specifically free
the value in its local storage.
<P>
Before thread A terminates, however, it must first free the dynamically
allocated memory in its local storage
<P>
<PRE>   free( TlsGetValue( TlsIndex ) );

</PRE>and then free the TLS index:
<P>
<PRE>   if ( !TlsFree( TlsIndex ) )
      // TlsFree() failed.  Handle error.
