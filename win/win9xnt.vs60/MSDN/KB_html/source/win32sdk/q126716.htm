   3.51, and 4.0
</UL>

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When doing multiple sends of less than the Maximum Transmission Unit
(MTU), you may see poor performance.  On an Ethernet network, the MTU
for TCP/IP is 1460 bytes.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When an application does two sends of less than a transport MTU, the
second send is delayed until an ACK is received from the remote host.
The delay occurs in case the application does another small send. TCP
can then coalesce the two small sends into one larger packet.  This
concept of collecting small sends into larger packets is called Nagling.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
There are a number of ways to avoid Nagling in an application. Here are
two. The second is more complex but gives a better performance benefit:

<UL><LI>Set the TCP_NODELAY socket option for the socket. This tells TCP/IP to
   send always, regardless of packet size. This will result in sub-optimal
   use of the physical network, but it will avoid the delay of waiting for
   an ACK.

<LI>Send larger blocks of data. The send() API call, when you include the
   overhead of the other network components involved, costs a couple of
   thousand instructions. One large send() call will be more efficient than
   two smaller send() calls, even if you need to do some buffer copies.
<P>
   Sending larger data blocks will also result in more efficient use of the
   physical network because packets will typically be larger and less
   numerous. This option is much better than the first (enabling
   TCP_NODELAY) and should be used if at all possible.
<P>
</UL>On Windows NT 3.51, if you are sending files, you should use the new
TransmitFile() API. This call reads the file data directly from the file
system cache and sends it out over the wire. The TransmitFile() call can
also take a data block that will be sent ahead of the file, if desired.
<P>

1122.
