<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
There are currently three hardware platforms for which Win32-based
applications can be written; they are Intel (x86), MIPS, and DEC Alpha.
Binary compatibility across these hardware platforms is not a viable
alternative. Therefore, Windows NT offers source compatibility. This means
that developers may create versions of their Win32 applications for each
CPU by recompiling.
<P>
For example, suppose that you have written a Win32-based application in C
and have used a 32-bit compiler that targets the Intel platform. In order
to produce a Win32-based application that runs on DEC Alpha, you would
purchase a 32-bit compiler that targets Alpha and recompile your code.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
It is important not to confuse source compatibility across hardware
platforms with binary compatibility across application execution
environments. Windows NT and Win32s do support binary compatibility between
different application execution environments. For example, the typical
16-bit Windows-based application can be run without modification on any
Windows NT machine. On the MIPS and Alpha platforms, this is achieved
through emulation. In addition, it is possible to design an x86 Win32-based
application so that it runs on Windows 3.1. This is achieved through
Win32s.
