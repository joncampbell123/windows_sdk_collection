The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Win32 SDK, versions 3.1, 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
An RPC application that uses stub code generated by MIDL throws memory
exceptions, causes a general protection (GP) fault, or overwrites memory in
the data heap. The RPC application is using a structure or union in the IDL
file.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The /Zp (packing) option of the MIDL compiler does not affect the size of
the structure; MIDL always uses a packing of 1. However, the /Zp option of
the C compiler does increase the size of the structure. Because MIDL
assumes a packing of one, it generates code that allocates less memory
than what is actually needed.
<P>
You can verify the behavior of the MIDL compiler by searching your client
stub code for _StubMsg.pfnAllocate. This call is present only with semi-
interpreted stubs (the default MIDL option, /Os). Try compiling your IDL
file with different /Zp settings, and notice that the memory allocated by
_StubMsg.pfnAllocate is unchanged, though it should change to accommodate
packing space.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
There are three solutions to correct this problem:

<OL><P><LI>Use MIDL's /Oi option.
<P>
   -or-

<P><LI>Use #pragma pack(1) in the stub code to use a packing of 1.
<P>
   -or-

<P><LI>Pad your interface declaration to match the padding done by the C
   compiler.
<P>
</OL>Please see MORE INFORMATION for details.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in MIDL 2.00.0102 for the
Win32 SDK. This problem has been fixed in MIDL 3.0, now shipping with
Windows NT 4.0 beta SDK.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Fully interpreted stubs (MIDL option /Oi) use another approach for
parameter marshaling, and this alternative approach does not have the
problem with the packing. The stub code produced with /Oi is slightly
slower, but for most applications the loss is negligible. If you decide to
use the /Oi option, make sure your remote procedures are declared as
__stdcall.  Refer to the MIDL documentation for more information on /Oi.
<P>
If you are not interested in using the /Oi option, you can manually pad
your interface declaration. To manually pad your interface declaration,
you must first determine the packing used by the C compiler. Visual C++
2.x for the x86 uses a packing of 4 by default. Otherwise, the packing is
specified by /Zp or #pramga pack(). Each element must start on a multiple
of the packing size.
<P>
The following example shows how to pad a structure with a packing of 4.
<P>
<PRE>   typedef struct   // This struct goes in the C code
   {
      char c;
      long l;
   } PADDED_BY_COMPILER_STRUCT;

   typedef struct   // This struct goes in the IDL file
   {
      char c;
      char pad[3];  // Add 3 bytes to align the next field on byte 4
      long l;
   } MANUALLY_PADDED_IDL_STRUCT;

</PRE></OL>Another alternative is to wrap the stub code generated by MIDL with
<P>
<PRE>   #pragma pack(1)

</PRE>Each time MIDL generates the stub code, you must insert #pragma pack
statements into the server stub.
<P>
For example:
<P>
<PRE>   /* File created by MIDL compiler version 2.00.0102 */
   /* at Fri Aug 18 13:48:23 1995
    */
   //@@MIDL_FILE_HEADING(  )

   #pragma pack(1)         // Added to fix MIDL pack problem

   #include &lt;string.h&gt;
   #include "bug.h"

   ... code generated by MIDL ...

   #pragma pack()          // Added to revert to default packing
