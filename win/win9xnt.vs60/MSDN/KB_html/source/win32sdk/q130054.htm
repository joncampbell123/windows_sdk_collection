<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Because of the variety of computer manufacturers (NEC, Fujitsu, IBMJ, and
so on) in Japan, sometimes Windows-based applications need to know which
OEM (original equipment manufacturer) manufactured the computer that is
running the application. This article explains how.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
There is no documented way to detect the manufacturer of the computer that
is currently running an application. However, a Windows-based application
can detect the type of OEM Windows by using the return value of the
GetKeyboardType() function.
<P>
If an application uses the GetKeyboardType API, it can get OEM ID by
specifying "1" (keyboard subtype) as argument of the function. Each OEM ID
is listed here:
<P>
<PRE>   OEM Windows       OEM ID
   ------------------------------
   Microsoft         00H (DOS/V)
   all AX            01H
   EPSON             04H
   Fujitsu           05H
   IBMJ              07H
   Matsushita        0AH
   NEC               0DH
   Toshiba           12H

</PRE>Application programs can use these OEM IDs to distinguish the type of OEM
Windows. Note, however, that this method is not documented, so Microsoft
may not support it in the future version of Windows.
<P>
As a rule, application developers should write hardware-independent code,
especially when making Windows-based applications. If they need to make a
hardware-dependent application, they must prepare the separated program
file for each different hardware architecture.
