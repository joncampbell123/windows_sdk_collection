The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Win32 Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows NT
   versions 3.1, 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Bound applications are designed and built so they can be run under either
OS/2 or MS-DOS. The OS/2 subsystem is not available on MIPS; therefore,
bound applications will not run as OS/2 applications on MIPS.
<P>
When a bound application is run under Windows NT on an 80x86 system, the
application will automatically run under the OS/2 subsystem if it is
available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The OS/2 subsystem is available by default on an 80x86 system. To
force bound applications to run as an MS-DOS-based application, you can
disable the OS/2 subsystem, but this is not recommended. Instead use
the FORCEDOS facility. Type "FORCEDOS /?" at the command line to get
help on FORCEDOS. It is not advised that you disable the OS/2
subsystem unless there is a very specific need that FORCEDOS does not
address.
<P>
To disable the OS/2 subsystem using RegEdit:
<P>
<PRE>   Go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
   Go to SYSTEM
   Go to Current Control Set
   Go to Control
   Go to Session Manager
   Go to SubSystems

   Modify 'Optional: REG_MULTI_SZ OS/2 Posix'. Specifically, remove OS/2
   and reboot.

</PRE>Once this is done, bound applications will run as MS-DOS-based
applications. Running an OS/2 application results in the following message:
<P>
<PRE>   Cannot connect to OS/2 subsystem

</PRE>WARNING: REGEDT32 is a very powerful utility that facilitates directly
changing the Registry database. Using REGEDT32 incorrectly can cause
serious problems, including hard disk corruption. It may be necessary to
reinstall the software to correct some problems. Microsoft does not support
changes made with REGEDT32. Use this tool AT YOUR OWN RISK.
