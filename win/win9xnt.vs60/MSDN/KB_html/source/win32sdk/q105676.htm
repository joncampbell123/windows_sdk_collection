The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Win32 Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows NT,
   versions 3.5, 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
A 16-bit Windows-based application running under Windows NT runs as a
thread in a virtual MS-DOS machine (VDM). These threads are
non-preemptively scheduled. A 16-bit Windows-based application shares an
address space and an input queue with other 16-bit Windows-based
applications running in the same VDM. Objects created by a thread
(application) are owned by the thread (application). This environment is
called WOW (Windows on Win32).
<P>
Windows NT version 3.5 introduced support for multiple WOWs, so a single 16-
bit Windows-based application, or group of applications, can be run in its
own address space. For additional information, please see the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../win32sdk/q115235.htm">Q115235</A></B>
   TITLE     : Running a Windows-Based Application in its Own VDM

</PRE>When a 16-bit Windows-based application is started by using CreateProcess()
without CREATE_SEPARATE_WOW_VDM, the thread handle is meaningless, normally
NULL, and the process handle is a special event handle only useful when
used with one of the wait APIs like WaitForSingleObject() to detect program
termination or WaitForInputIdle to detect when the app is up and fully
running with no pending input.
<P>
NOTE: When you call CreateProcess() with CREATE_SEPARATE_WOW_VDM, the
handles returned in the hProcess and hThread fields of the
PROCESS_INFORMATION structure are valid handles. The hProcess handle is the
handle to the new WOW process, but the hThread handle is the handle to the
WOWEXEC thread, and not the thread of the application that you spawned. You
can wait on either of these handles and you will be released when the
Windows-based application terminates, because the separate VDM goes away
when the last application in it terminates. Be aware that if your Windows-
based application spawns another Windows-based application and terminates,
the VDM stays around, because the application is run in the same VDM as the
application that spawned it.
<P>
Similarly, the PROCESS_INFORMATION.dwProcessId and the
PROCESS_INFORMATION.dwThreadId variables are also valid IDs when you use
the CREATE_WOW_SEPARATE_VDM flag to start your 16-bit application. Just
like with the handles, however, they do not directly relate to the 16-bit
application but to the VDM process and the WOWEXEC thread.
<P>
CAUTION: As Microsoft Knowledge Base Article <B><A href="../win32sdk/q115235.htm">Q115235</A></B> states, separate VDMs
are not free. Each separate VDM that you create consumes about 2.5MB of
private memory. Creating a separate VDM just so that you can get more
useful handles and/or IDs for the application is considered poor
programming practice.
<P>
A common question is "How can I terminate a 16-bit process from a 32-bit
process?" As implied above, PROCESS_INFORMATION.hProcess cannot be used in
TerminateProcess() and PROCESS_INFORMATION.dwThreadId cannot be used in
PostThreadMessage().
<P>
One way to terminate an individual 16-bit Windows-based application is to
enumerate the desktop windows using EnumWindows(), determine which is the
correct window, obtain the thread ID with GetWindowThreadProcessId(), and
post a WM_QUIT message via PostThreadMessage() to terminate the
application.
<P>
Another way to terminate an individual 16-bit Windows-based application is
to use the TOOLHELP APIs. Use TaskFirst() and TaskNext() to enumerate the
tasks, determine which is the correct task, and call TerminateApp() to kill
the application. The Windows SDK sample THSAMPLE demonstrates how this can
be done.
