<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes the major differences between the Win32 Data Link
Control (DLC) API and the DOS DLC interface. It assumes familiarity with
the DLC protocol and the relevant specification documents. Where
appropriate, differences from the IBM OS/2 DLC interface are also
described.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Win32 DLC API has been designed to be as compatible with the IBM OS/2
DLC API for OS/2 1.xx as possible. The limits to compatibility are those
imposed by the operating system functions (such as Event vs. Semaphores),
and the differing memory models (flat vs. segmented).
<P>
The API is described herein as differences from the Command Control Block
(CCB) interface in the IBM LAN Technical Reference, Fourth Edition (Dec,
1990). Areas addressed in the IBM documentation are generally not repeated
here.
<P>
<P><h3>Differences between the Win32 and OS/2 DLC API</h3>
 
<P>
The following is a list of the differences between IBM OS/2 DLC and the
Win32 DLC API.

<UL><LI>All 16-bit segment offsets in CCBs and parameter tables have been
   replaced by 32-bit flat pointers.

<LI>The buffer pool is managed by the DLC driver. Applications can no
   longer define the segment size of the buffer pool or add new buffers to
   the pool. The application must, however, always check the size field in
   the buffer header.

<LI>The application ID and application key code fields in the CCB structure
   have been rendered obsolete by the ability to provide an optional
   security descriptor when an adapter is opened.

<LI>The IBM Token-Ring hardware-specific parameter fields that cannot be
   supported by other common token-ring adapters have been removed. These
   fields are not available on Ethernet adapters and applications should
   in general, avoid using them.

<LI>Win32 Events are used instead of OS/2 system semaphores to signal the
   completion of asycnhronous requests.

<LI>All global resources like functional address, group address on
   Ethernet, link, sap and direct stations, which were shared by all active
   applications are now available to each application separately.

<LI>Ethernet type codes are supported when sending DIRECT frames.

<LI>Applications may define a 48-bit multicast address on Ethernet
   adapters. This address overwrites the 32-bit broadcast address set by
   DIR.SET.GROUP.ADDRESS

<LI>Applications can send several frames with the TRANSMIT.FRAMES command
   from a DLC station.
<P>
</UL><h3>Differences between the Win32 and DOS/2 DLC API</h3>
 

<UL><LI>The post routines of DOS DLC have been replaced by a READ request.

<LI>The receive buffers are compatible with OS/2 1.xx DLC API and are
   different from the DOS DLC receive headers.

<LI>The parameter tables use OS/2 specific parameter fields.

<LI>No DOS-specific functions have been implemented.
<P>
</UL><h3>Win32 DLC API</h3>
 
<P>
In general, most of the functions and their parameter blocks are identical
to those of the IBM DLC API for OS/2 1.xx, with the pointers being changed
from 16-bit offsets to 32-bit flat addresses.
<P>
Because of the compatibility with the IBM DLC specification, all Ethernet
network and broadcast addresses in the functions and data structures that
are common to Ethernet and token-ring networks, use the token-ring Net
headers and have swapped bit order in the addresses. The functions and data
structures that are only possible on the Ethernet use the normal Ethernet
Net headers and bit order. For example, DIX Ethernet frames use the
Ethernet order in the receive and transmit buffer Net headers.
DIR.SET.MULTICAST.ADDRESS also uses the Ethernet order.
<P>
The data types, constants and error codes mentioned in the following
sections are documented in the DLCAPI.H file, which ships with Microsoft
Visual C++ version 4.0, or the Win32 SDK.
<P>
<P><h3>API Call</h3>
 
<P>
The Win32 DLC services are provided by a single entry point of
<P>
ASCLAN_STATUS Acslan(PLLC_CCB pCCB, PLLC_CCB * ppBadCCB);
<P>
where:
<P>
<PRE>    pCCB    - Command Control Block, defines the function type and its
              input parameters.
    pBadCCB - Returns the address of the invalid CCB, if server CCBs were
              queued together and one of them failed. The parameter may be
              NULL if the application only specifies one command.

    Return code: ASCLAN status code. The DLC error or success status is
                 always returned in the CCB status field.

</PRE>The Command Control Block (CCB) defines parameters common for all DLC
requests. The request-specific parameters are either in an external
parameter table or in four bytes reserved for them in the Win32 CCB.
For example:
<P>
<PRE>//
// LLC_CCB - the Command Control Block structure from DLCAPI.H
//

</PRE>typedef struct _LLC_CCB {
<PRE>    UCHAR uchAdapterNumber;         // Adapter
    UCHAR uchDlcCommand;            // DLC command
    UCHAR uchDlcStatus;             // DLC command completion code
    UCHAR uchReserved1;             // reserved for DLC DLL
    struct _LLC_CCB* pNext;         // CCB chain
    ULONG ulCompletionFlag;         // used in command completion
    CCB_PARMS u;                    // parameters
    HANDLE hCompletionEvent;        // event for command completion
    UCHAR uchReserved2;             // reserved for DLC DLL
    UCHAR uchReadFlag;              // set when special READ CCB chained
    USHORT usReserved3;             // reserved for DLC DLL
</PRE>} LLC_CCB, *PLLC_CCB;
<P>
where:
<P>
<PRE>    uchAdapterNumber - Network adapter number, 0, 1, 2.. 255
    uchCommand       - Function code, mostly compatible with IBM spec.
    uchDlcStatus     - DLC return status
    pNext            - Used to chain CCBs. Several Canceled commands or
                       completed TRANSMIT CCBs may be chained with this
                       field. It can also provide a READ command to
                       complete the current command.
    ulCompletionFlag - Optional flag set by READ when the command is
                       completed. The DLC API driver does not use the
                       parameter if it was set to 0 before the call.
    u                - Function-dependent parameter table.
    hCompletionEvent - Event handle which can be used to wait for command
                       completion. This must be created with the Win32 API
                       CreateEvent.
    uchReadFlag      - This should be set if a READ CCB is chained in this
                       command.

</PRE>Most DLC commands may only be executed synchronously, with the status and
the optional output parameters being returned immediately. The network I/O
commands may be executed sychronously or asynchronously.
<P>
<P><h3>Command Completion</h3>
 
<P>
The NT DLC command can be completed in two ways:
<P>
Waiting on the event handle defined in the CCB.
<P>
-or-
<P>
Setting a completion flag in the CCB and reading the command completion
with the READ command.
<P>
The method of polling on the status code in the CCB is unreliable in
Windows NT and should not be used. The status field may be updated before
the other returned parameters have been set, and should not be polled for
completion.
<P>
<P><h3>Ethernet Type Support</h3>
 
<P>
The DLC API specification for the direct interface only allows data
encapsulated in 802.5 or 802.3 frames. This makes it impossible to receive
other Ethernet types.  The new direct station ids 0004H and 0005H can
receive all Ethernet types.
<P>
Users may also specify a specific Ethernet frame type in the new parameter
field of the DIR.OPEN.STATION command. The direct station then only
receives frames which have that specific Ethernet frame type. The received
frame type is returned in the DLC header field of the non-contiguous frame
header.
<P>
Received DIX Ethernet frames always include the frame padding, if the frame
length is less than 64 bytes.
<P>
The Ethernet NET header is used whenever an application is sending or
receiving Ethernet type frames.
<P>
<P><h3>Buffer Management</h3>
 
<P>
The buffer allocation and management methods in the Win32 DLC API are quite
different from the DOS or OS/2 1.xx methods. The buffer headers, however,
are as defined in the specifications.
<P>
The DLC buffers of Win32 are allocated from a single virtual memory block
and the DLC driver defines the buffer segment sizes. For each received
frame it allocates a minimal combination of 256, 512, 1024, 2048 and 4096
buffer segments (at most one of each size). The algorithm minimizes the
non-paged memory needed for different buffer segment headers (DLC headers,
internal segment header and MDL). It also allocates the minimal number of
buffers for the received frames. Applications may request the fixed size
buffers or an optimal number of buffers for a frame size.
<P>
The DLC buffers pools are dynamically expanded from the
application-specified minimum size threshold if the size of free buffers is
less than this value during a READ, DLC.FLOW.CONTROL or BUFFER.GET command.
The buffer pool cannot, however, be increased beyond its maximum size.
<P>
An application may use its own transmit buffers or send data directly from
the buffer pool. Because the DLC driver locks all the transmit buffers that
are not in the buffer pool, applications should avoid using too many small
transmit buffers.
<P>
Use the following methods to obtain better performance:

<UL><LI>Allocate transmit buffers from the buffer pool. Data may be copied to
   these buffers from the user buffers.

<LI>The negotiated maximum frame size should fit into a single DLC buffer
   (e.g., 2048 or 4096 bytes minus the frame and buffer headers).

<LI>Receive several frames with the READ command.

<LI>Use the CCBs defined in the LLC_READ_COMMAND structure.
<P>
</UL><h3>DLC API Functions</h3>
 
<P>
The following section itemizes the functions in the Win32 DLC set that are
different from the CCB2 interface of the IBM LAN Technical Reference. Other
functions are identical to the specification, except that pointers are
32-bit flat pointers.

<OL><P><LI>BUFFER.CREATE
</OL> 
<P>
This function creates a new DLC buffer pool and returns its handle. All SAP
stations and the direct station on the same adapter number use the same
buffer pool. The same buffer pool may also be shared by different adapters
owned by the same application. For example:
<P>
typedef struct _LLC_BUFFER_CREATE_PARMS {
<PRE>    OUT HANDLE  hBufferPoolHandle;
    IN PVOID        pBuffer;
    IN ULONG        cbBufferSize;
    IN ULONG        cbMinimumSizeThreshold;
</PRE></OL>} LLC_BUFFER_CREATE_PARMS, *PLLC_UFFER_CREATE_PARMS;
<P>
<P><h3>LLC_BUFFER_CREATE_PARMS Structure</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>    hBufferPoolHandle   Handle of the created buffer pool. This handle can
                        be used by the same process to share a single
                        buffer pool by several adapter contexts. This
                        handle may be given in the extended parameter
                        table of another DIR.OPEN.ADAPTER command.

    pBuffer             The application must provide this buffer to
                        the DLC buffer manager. The buffer may be static
                        or allocated from the heap. The buffer manager
                        allocates all DLC buffers from this virtual
                        buffer. This buffer area must not be used for
                        anything else.

    cbBufferSize        The total size of the buffer. This must be the
                        maximum size of the buffer pool. 0x2000 (hex) is
                        the minimum buffer size, because the buffer manager
                        only uses the full 4K pages.

    cbMinimumSizeThreshold   The buffer manager tries to keep at least this
                             much free space in the buffer pool. The
                             buffer pool is extended by READ, BUFFER.GET
                             and DLC.FLOW.CONTROL commands. This
                             parameter should be big enough to hold all
                             data received between two sequential READ
                             commands. The buffer manager also releases
                             (unlocks) the extra buffer space after a
                             constant time.

</PRE>All buffer segments in a DLC buffer pool are allocated from a single
virtual memory block. Its size is also the maximum size of the buffer pool.
This command returns an error if it cannot lock the given minimum buffer
size. At least one adapter must be open before buffer pool can be created.
The RECEIVE command fails if a buffer pool has not been defined
for the adapter.
<P>
Windows/Windows NT DLC applications should very carefully select the total
and minimum buffer pool sizes, because the memory manager of
Windows/Windows NT has a dynamic quota available pages for each process. A
DLC application may not work at all if it tries to allocate too large a
buffer pool in low memory conditions. The transmit commands using buffers
outside of the buffer pool may fail for the same reason.
<P>
DLC applications should minimize the time that the buffers returned by the
data receive or by the BUFFER.GET request are held, because those buffers
are still locked in the memory. DLC applications should also be able to
recover if the DLC device driver runs out of the buffers, because it may
not be able to add new memory to the buffer pool (if the entire system is
running out of memory).
<P>
In any case, there always is at least the minimal free buffer space if the
BUFFER.CREATE request has been completed successfully.

<OL><P><LI>BUFFER.FREE
</OL> 
<P>
This request returns one or more buffers to the adapter's pool. It cannot
be used to add new virtual memory blocks to the existing pool. The buffers
must have been obtained with BUFFER.GET

<OL><P><LI>BUFFER.GET
</OL> 
<P>
This command returns the requested buffers. The command can be used both
to get several buffers of the same size or to get an optimal set of buffers
for the given frame size.
<P>
In the first case below, cBufferToGet includes the number the returned
buffers and cbBufferSize is the size of the returned buffer segment.  The
size is rounded up to next available buffer size (256, 512, 1024, 2048 or
4096).
<P>
In the second case the number of returned buffers must be 0 and
cbBufferSize includes the size of the actual frame that is copied to
buffers. The buffer manager returns enough buffers to contain the
whole frame including its buffer headers. cbBuffersLeft returns the size
of free locked memory in 256 bytes blocks or 65536 if the actual size is
above 1MB. For example:
<P>
typedef struct _LLC_BUFFER_GET_PARMS {
<PRE>    IN  USHORT          usReserved;
    IN  USHORT          cBuffersLeft;
    IN  USHORT          cBufferToGet;
    IN  USHORT          cbBufferSize;
    OUT PLLC_BUFFER     pFirstBuffer;
</PRE></OL>} LLC_BUFFER_GET_PARMS, *PLLC_BUFFER_GET_PARMS;
<P>

<OL><P><LI>DLC.FLOW.CONTROL
</OL> 
<P>
A Windows NT application should issue this command immediately when a link
station enters a local busy state. The driver clears the busy state when
there are enough free buffers to receive more frames in the buffer pool.

<OL><P><LI>DIR.CLOSE.ADAPTER
</OL> 
<P>
This command closes the adapter logically, release all its resource and
cancels any outstanding commands. Open SAP or link stations are reset
prior to completion of this command. The canceled commands return error
code 0x62. If the application has previously set bits of the functional
address, the adapter support software resets the bits.

<OL><P><LI>DIR.INITIALIZE
</OL> 
<P>
This command resets the network adapter. Only the BRING_UPS field in the
parameter block is returned. All other fields are reserved. For security
reasons, the command resets the adapter physically only if the adapter was
not functioning normally when the command was issued.
<P>
See the  IBM LAN Technical Reference  for further information.

<OL><P><LI>DIR.INTERRUPT
</OL> 
<P>
This command does not do anything in Windows NT.

<OL><P><LI>DIR.OPEN.ADAPTER
</OL> 
<P>
This command must be completed successfully before any network
communication can start. It does not usually open the physical adapter, but
results in a logical open. This is because multiple applications and
drivers may be accessing the same DLC driver.
<P>
Applications may have to provide the security descriptor parameter in the
parameter table.
<P>
All fields specific to the IBM Token Ring hardware or the DOS NETBIOS
interface have been removed from the parameter tables. The DOS security and
direct interface buffer pool parameters are also obsolete.
<P>
The bring-up diagnostic result is returned (it is not defined in CCB1).
Otherwise, the CCB1 parameter tables and parameters are used.

<OL><P><LI>DIR.OPEN.DIRECT
</OL> 
<P>
The fields that define the buffer pool in the IBM specification are not
used. Windows NT provides an extension to receive frames of specific
Ethernet types using the direct station when the usEthernetType field has
a valid Ethernet type (&gt;1500).
<P>
The protocol type mask, match and offset can be used to receive frames for
a particular subprotocol type or socket. The optional parameters are
ignored if the ulProtocolTypeMask is zero. The offset defines the distance
of the protocol type from the beginning of the protocol header (offset 14
in the frame header). The mask is used to bitwise AND the data and the
result must be equal to the match.

That is, the packet is received whenever:

All parameter fields of this function may not be supported by some network

including IBM Token Ring.

<OL><P><LI>DIR.SET.FUNCTIONAL.ADDRESS

<OL><P><LI>DIR.SET.MULTICAST.ADDRESS
</OL> 
<P>
This command sets a 48-bit multicast address for the currently open DLC
adapter context. A zero value removes the previous multicast address. This
command is only supported on Ethernet networks and is an alternative to the
DIR.SET.GROUP.ADDRESS function that can only set the lowest 32 bits of a
multicast address. This operation may fail if the Ethernet adapter does not
have a multicast address available.
<P>
The bit order of the multicast address is the normal Ethernet bit order.

<OL><P><LI>DIR.SET.GROUP.ADDRESS

Only one application may set a group address for a token ring adapter. This
operation may also fail if the Ethernet adapter does not have available
multicast addresses.

environment on Windows NT. The API is directly compatible with existing IBM
emulators using the DOS DLC API in DOS.
<P>
Windows applications that communicate with DOS terminate-and-stay-resident
(TSR) applications to access DLC services should also work unmodified on
WOW.
