<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Complete enumeration of system fonts is a two-phase process.
Applications should first call EnumFontfamilies with NULL as the
family name to enumerate all the font face names in the system.
Applications should then take each face name and call EnumFontFamilies
again to obtain the style names (for TrueType fonts only) or the
supported point sizes (for raster fonts only). The style names are not
supported for the raster and vector fonts. Because TrueType and vector
fonts are continuously scalable, their point sizes are not enumerated.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following steps detail the enumeration:

<OL><P><LI>Call EnumFontFamilies with NULL as the family name (lpszFamily) to list
   one font from each available font family.

<P><LI>In the EnumFontFamProc callback function, look at the nFontType
   parameter.

<P><LI>If nFontType has the TRUETYPE_FONTTYPE flag set, then call
   EnumFontFamilies with the family name set to the font's type face
   name (lfFaceName of the ENUMLOGFONT structure). The callback
   function is called once for each style name. This enumeration is
   useful if the application is interested in finding a TrueType font
   with a specific style name (such as "Outline"). Because a TrueType
   font is continuously scalable, it is not necessary to enumerate a
   given font for point sizes. An application may use any desired
   point size. If the application is listing the enumerated TrueType
   fonts, it can simply choose some representative point sizes in a
   given range. The point sizes recommended by "The Windows Interface:
   An Application Design Guide" (page 159, Section 8.4.1.4) are 8, 9,
   10, 11, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 36, 48, and 72. All
   TrueType fonts are available on both displays and printers, so an
   application can be sure that the font appears the same on the
   display and the printer.

<P><LI>If nFontType has the RASTER_FONTTYPE flag set, then call
   EnumFontFamilies with the family name set to the font's type face
   name. The callback function is called once for each available point
   size. Raster fonts can be scaled only in multiples of the available
   point sizes. Because scaled raster fonts are usually not appealing
   to the user, applications may choose to limit themselves to the
   available sizes. Because Microsoft Windows version 3.1 does not
   define style names for raster fonts, there is no need to enumerate
   for style names.
<P>
   If the nFontType also has the DEVICE_FONTTYPE flag set, then the
   current font is a raster font available to the printer driver for
   use with the printer. The printer may have these fonts in hardware
   or be capable of downloading them when necessary. Applications that
   use such fonts should be aware that similar raster fonts may not be
   available on the display device. The converse is also true. If the
   DEVICE_FONTTYPE flag is not set, then applications should be aware
   that a similar font may not be available on the printer. Fonts
   generated by font packages such as Adobe Type Manager (ATM) are
   listed as device fonts.

<P><LI>If nFontType has neither the TRUETYPE_FONTTYPE nor the
   RASTER_FONTTYPE flags set, then the enumerated font is a vector
   font. Vector fonts are also continuously scalable so they do not
   have to be enumerated for point sizes. Because Windows 3.1 does not
   support style names for vector fonts, there is no need to enumerate
   them for style names. Vector fonts are generally used by devices
   such as plotters that cannot support raster fonts. These fonts
   generally have a poor appearance on raster devices, so many
   applications avoid them.
