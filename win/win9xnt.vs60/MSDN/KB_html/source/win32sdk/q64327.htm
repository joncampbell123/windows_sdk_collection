<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Owner-draw controls are a new feature of Windows version 3.0. Because your
application does all the drawing of the contents of the controls, you can
customize them any way you like. Owner-draw controls are similar to
predefined controls in that Windows will handle the control's functionality
and mouse and keyboard input processing. However, you are responsible for
drawing the owner-draw control in its normal, selected, and focus states.
<P>
You can create owner-draw controls from the menu, button, and list-box
classes. You can create owner-draw combo boxes, but they must have the
CBS_DROPDOWNLIST style (equates to a static text item and a list box). The
elements of an owner-draw control can be composed of strings, bitmaps,
lines, rectangles, and other drawing functions in any combination, in your
choice of colors.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Windows SDK sample application MENU demonstrates owner-draw menu items.
The SDK sample application OWNCOMBO is a fairly large example of owner-draw
and predefined list boxes and combo boxes.
<P>
The Microsoft Software Library contains simplified examples of an owner-
draw push button, owner-draw list boxes, and an owner-draw drop-down list
style combo box. Each of these examples includes descriptive text in a
related Knowledge Base article. For additional information, please see the
following article(s) in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : Owner-Draw Example: Right - and Decimal Alignment

</PRE>To respond to a WM_MEASUREITEM message, you MUST specify the height of the
appropriate item in your control. Optionally, you can specify the item's
width as well.
<P>
If you want to do something special when a string is deleted from a list
box, you should process WM_DELETEITEM messages. Windows's default action is
to erase the deleted string and to redraw the list box.
<P>
If you want to have control over the sorting for the order of items in a
list box or combo box that does not have the *_HASSTRINGS style, you should
specify the appropriate *_SORT style and process WM_COMPAREITEM messages.
If the *_SORT and *_HASSTRINGS styles are present, Windows will
automatically do the sorting without sending WM_COMPAREITEM messages. If
*_SORT is not specified, WM_COMPAREITEM messages will not be generated and
items will be displayed in the list box in the order in which they were
inserted.
<P>
The heart of owner-draw controls is the response to WM_DRAWITEM messages.
During this processing is when you draw an entire button or each individual
item in a menu, list box, or combo box. Because Windows does not interfere
in the drawing of owner-draw controls, your application must draw the
specified control item. The display of the control must indicate the state
of the control. Common states are as follows:

<OL><P><LI>Focus state (has the focus or not)

<P><LI>Selection state (selection or not)

<P><LI>Emphasis state (active, grayed, or disabled) (less common to
   process)
<P>
</OL>See the article titled "Owner-Draw: Handling WM_DRAWITEM for Drawing
Controls" for information about drawing controls in their various
states. Familiarity with the WM_DRAWITEM message and the various
control states is extremely helpful before trying to follow the code
examples.
<P>
Under Windows 95, the BS_BITMAP style allows buttons to display bitmaps
without using owner-draw.
