The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Win32 Application Programming Interface (API) included with:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Microsoft Windows NT version 3.5
</UL></PRE> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Under NTFS, the API GetFileTime() returns the create time, last access
time, and last write time for the specified file. The times returned in the
FILETIME structures are in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC). This is also
the time that NTFS uses. You can use FileTimeToLocalFileTime() to convert a
file time to a local time. However, if you automatically adjust for
Daylight Saving Time, FileTimeToLocalFileTime() will adjust for Daylight
Saving Time based on whether the current date should be adjusted for
Daylight Saving Time, not based on whether the date represented by the
FILETIME structure should be adjusted.
<P>
The behavior in this situation is different under FAT, but may be changed
to match the behavior under NTFS in a future version of Windows NT.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The result of this behavior, which is by design, is that reported file
times under NTFS may change with the start and end of Daylight Saving Time.
For example, suppose that the file TEST.C has a last write FILETIME
representing Jan 1, 1995 9:00pm (UTC), it is not Daylight Saving Time,
and you are in the Pacific time zone. Both the DIR command and the
following sample code report the file time as 1:00pm (LocalTime = UTC - 8).
<P>
<P><h3>Sample Code 1</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   #include &lt;windows.h&gt;

   void main()
   {
      HANDLE hFile;
      FILETIME ftCreate, ftLastAccess, ftLastWrite, ftLocal;
      SYSTEMTIME st;

      char buf[80];

   // Open the file.

      hFile = CreateFile( "test.c",
                          GENERIC_READ,
                          0,
                          NULL,
                          OPEN_EXISTING,
                          FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL,
                          NULL );

   // Get the file time (in UTC) and convert to local time.

      GetFileTime( hFile, &amp;ftCreate, &amp;ftLastAccess, &amp;ftLastWrite );
      FileTimeToLocalFileTime( &amp;ftLastWrite, &amp;ftLocal );

   // Display the time, as a test.

      FileTimeToSystemTime( &amp;ftLocal, &amp;st );
      GetTimeFormat( LOCALE_USER_DEFAULT, 0, &amp;st, NULL, buf, sizeof(buf) );
      MessageBox( NULL, buf, " FILE TIME", MB_OK );
   }

</PRE>Now, set the date to 7/1/95 and enable Automatically Adjust for Daylight
Saving Time. The DIR command and the sample code above will report the
file time as 2:00pm, because FileTimeToLocalFileTime() has adjusted for
Daylight Saving Time (LocalTime = UTC - 7).
<P>
The following sample code will correctly report the file time of TEST.C
with the date set to 7/1/95 under NTFS. The FILETIME structure is
converted to a SYSTEMTIME structure with FileTimeToSystemTime(). Then the
time is converted using SystemTimeToTzSpecificLocalTime(). If you need to
convert back to a FILETIME structure, use SystemTimeToFileTime() after the
conversion to local time.
<P>
<P><h3>Sample Code 2</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   #include &lt;windows.h&gt;

   void main()
   {
      HANDLE hFile;
      FILETIME ftCreate, ftLastAccess, ftLastWrite;
      SYSTEMTIME stUTC, st;
      char buf[80];

   // Open the file.

      hFile = CreateFile( "test.c",
                          GENERIC_READ,
                          0,
                          NULL,
                          OPEN_EXISTING,
                          FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL,
                          NULL );

   // Get the file time (in UTC) and convert to local time.

      GetFileTime( hFile, &amp;ftCreate, &amp;ftLastAccess, &amp;ftLastWrite );
      FileTimeToSystemTime( &amp;ftLastWrite, &amp;stUTC );
      SystemTimeToTzSpecificLocalTime( NULL, &amp;stUTC, &amp;st);

   // Display the time, as a test.

      GetTimeFormat( LOCALE_USER_DEFAULT, 0, &amp;st, NULL, buf, sizeof(buf) );
      MessageBox( NULL, buf, "FILE TIME", MB_OK );
   }

</PRE>The FAT file system stores local time, not UTC. GetFileTime() gets cached
UTC times from FAT. In this sample, the time stored is 1pm and the cached
time is 9pm. When it becomes Daylight Saving Time, sample codes 1 and 2
will demonstrate the same behavior that they do under NTFS, because 9pm is
still used. However, when you restart the machine, the new cached time will
be 8pm (UTC = LocalTime + 7). The call to FileTimeToLocalFileTime() cancels
the adjustment made by GetFileTime() (LocalTime = UTC - 7). Therefore,
sample code 1 will report the correct time under FAT, but sample code 2
will not.
<P>
On the other hand, FindFirstFile() on FAT always reads the time from the
file (stored as local time) and converts it into UTC, adjusting for DST
based on the current date. So if FindFirstFile() is called, the date is
changed to a different DST season, and then FindFirstFile() is called
again, the UTC returned by the two calls will be different.
