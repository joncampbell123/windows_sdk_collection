<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The six issues listed in this article must be addressed when writing
Windows Sockets applications that use the AF_NETBIOS protocol family.
<P>
NOTE: Windows 95 does not support AF_NETBIOS.

<P><h3>Issues to Address When Writing Windows Sockets Applications</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>When creating an AF_NETBIOS socket, specify -1 times lana for the
   protocol option.
<P>
   The Windows NT WinSock library allows the programmer to create a
   socket that allows communication over a particular lana. The lana
   number is specified via the protocol option of the socket() function.
   To create an AF_NETBIOS socket, specify -1 times the lana for the
   protocol option of the socket() function. For example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      SOCKET hSock0 = socket( AF_NETBIOS, SOCK_DGRAM, 0 );  // lana 0;
      SOCKET hSock1 = socket( AF_NETBIOS, SOCK_DGRAM, -1 ); // lana 1;
</PRE><P>
   The lana numbers are basically indices to the list of transports
   supported by the NetBIOS implementation. A given host has one unique
   lana number for every installed transport that supports NetBIOS. For
   example, listed below are some possible lana numbers for a typical
   Windows NT configuration:
<P>
<PRE>      Lana     Transport
      ----------------------------------------------------------
      0        TCP/IP // lana 0 is the default NetBIOS transport
      1        IPX/SPX w/NetBIOS
      3        NetBEUI

   In the case of a multihomed host (a machine with multiple network
   adapters), the number of unique lana numbers equals the number of
   network transports that support NetBIOS times the number of network
   adapters. For example, if the machine depicted above contained
   two network adapters, it would have a total of 3 * 2 = 6 lana numbers.

   Also, please note the WSNETBS.H header included with the Windows NT
   version 3.5 SDK erroneously defines the NBPROTO_NETBEUI symbol. This
   symbol cannot be used as a protocol option and should be ignored.

</PRE><P><LI>Use the snb_type values provided by the WSNETBS.H header for NetBIOS
   name registration and deregistration.
<P>
   When filling out a sockaddr_nb structure, you must specify the
   appropriate value for the snb_type field. This field is used during
   the bind() operation to handle NetBIOS name registration. The WSNETBS.H
   header defines several values for this field; however only the
   following two values are currently implemented:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - NETBIOS_UNIQUE_NAME
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      Registers a unique NetBIOS name. This action is usually performed
      by a client or a server to register an endpoint.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - NETBIOS_GROUP_NAME
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      Registers a group name. This action is typically performed in
      preparation for sending or receiving NetBIOS multicasts.
</PRE><P>
   Names are registered during the bind() operation.

<P><LI>Use the supported socket types of SOCK_DGRAM and SOCK_SEQPACKET.
<P>
   Due to the nature of NetBIOS connection services, SOCK_STREAM
   is not supported.

<P><LI>Choose a NetBIOS port that does not conflict with your network
   client software.
<P>
   The NetBIOS port is an eight-bit value stored in the last position of
   the snb_name that is used by various network services to differentiate
   various type of NetBIOS names. When you register NetBIOS names, choose
   port values that do not cause conflicts with existing network services.
   This is of particular importance if you are registering a NetBIOS name
   that duplicates a user name or a machine name on the network. The
   following lists the reserved port values:
<P>
<P><PRE>      0x00, 0x03, 0x06, 0x1f, 0x20, 0x21, 0xbe, 0xbf, 0x1b,
      0x1c, 0x1d, 0x1e
</PRE>
<P><LI>Applications should use all available lana numbers when initiating
   communication.
<P>
   Because the NetBIOS interface can take advantage of multiple transport
   protocols, it is important to use all lanas when initiating
   communication. Server applications should accept connections on
   sockets for each lana number, and client applications should attempt
   to connect on every available lana. In a similar fashion, data gram
   broadcasts should be sent from sockets created from each lana.
<P>
   The following diagram depicts the lana mappings for two machines.
   In order for a client application running on Machine A to communicate
   with a server application on Host B, the client application must create
   a socket on lana 3, and the server must create a socket on lana 1.
   Because the client and the server cannot know in advance which single
   lana to use, they must create sockets for all lanas.
<P>
<PRE>      Host A (Client)            Host B (Server)
      ---------------            ---------------
      lana  Transport            lana  Transport
      ----  ---------            ----  ---------

      0     NetBEUI              0     TCP/IP
      3     IPX/SPX &lt;==========&gt; 1     IPX/SPX
                                 3     NetBEUI

   The above diagram illustrates several other important points about
   lanas. First, a transport that has a certain lana number on one host
   does not necessarily have the same lana number on other machines.
   Second, lana numbers do not have to be sequential.

   The EnumProtocols() function can be used to enumerate valid lana
   numbers. Listed below is a code fragment that demonstrates this type
   of functionality:

   #include &lt;nspapi.h&gt;

         DWORD          cb = 0;
         PROTOCOL_INFO *pPI;
         BOOL           pfLanas[100];

         int            iRes,
                        nLanas = sizeof(pfLanas) / sizeof(BOOL);

         // Specify NULL for lpiProtocols to enumerate all protocols.

         // First, determine the output buffer size.
         iRes = EnumProtocols( NULL, NULL, &amp;cb );

         // Verify the expected error was received.
         // The following code must appear on one line.
         assert( iRes == -1 &amp;&amp; GetLastError() ==
                      ERROR_INSUFFICIENT_BUFFER );

         if (!cb)
         {
            fprintf( stderr, "No available NetBIOS transports.\n");
            break;
         }

         // Allocate a buffer of the specified size.
         pPI = (PROTOCOL_INFO*) malloc( cb );

         // Enumerate all protocols.
         iRes = EnumProtocols( NULL, pPI, &amp;cb );

         // EnumProtocols() lists each lana number twice, once for
         // SOCK_DGRAM and once for SOCK_SEQPACKET. Set a flag in pfLanas
         // so unique lanas can be identified.

         memset( pfLanas, 0, sizeof( pfLanas ));

         while (iRes &gt; 0)
            // Scan protocols looking for AF_NETBIOS
            if ( pPI[--iRes].iAddressFamily == AF_NETBIOS )
               // found one.
               pfLanas[ pPI[iRes].iProtocol ] = TRUE;

         fprintf( stderr, "Available NetBIOS lana numbers: " );
         while( nLanas-- )
            if ( pfLanas[nLanas] )
               fprintf( stderr, "%d ", nLanas );

         free( pPI );
      }

</PRE><P><LI>Performance: Use of AF_NETBIOS is recommended for communication with
   down-level clients.
<P>
   On Windows NT, NetBIOS is a high level emulated interface.
   Consequently, applications that use the WinSock() function over NetBIOS
   obtain lower throughput than applications that use WinSock() over a
   native transport such as IPX/SPX or TCP/IP. However, due to the
   simplicity of the WinSock interface, it is a desirable interface for
   writing new 32-bit applications that communicate with NetBIOS
   applications running on down-level clients like Windows for Workgroups
   or Novell Netware.
