<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The LVS_SHAREIMAGELISTS style is available for listview controls to enable
the same image lists to be used with multiple listview controls. There is
no equivalent TVS_SHAREIMAGELISTS, however, for the treeview control
because treeviews share image lists by default.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
By default, a listview control takes ownership of the image lists
associated with it. For listviews, this could be any of three image lists
(those with large icons, small icons, or state images). These three image
lists are set by calling ListView_SetImageList() with the flags
LVSIL_NORMAL, LVSIL_SMALL, or LVSIL_STATE respectively. The listview then
takes responsibility for destroying these image lists when it is destroyed.
<P>
Setting the LVS_SHAREIMAGELISTS style, however, moves ownership of the
image lists from the listview control to the application. Because this
style assumes that the image lists are shared by multiple listviews,
specifying this style requires that the application destroy the image lists
when the last listview using them is destroyed. Failure to do so causes a
memory leak in the system.
<P>
Similarly, because treeviews share image lists by default, an application
that associates an image list with a treeview should ensure that the image
list is destroyed after the last treeview using it is destroyed. Another
way to do this is to first set the treeview's image list to NULL by using
TreeView_SetImageList(); then destroy the handle to the previous image list
returned by the function.
