The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Win32s, versions 1.25, 1.3, 1.30a, 1.3c
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Win32-based applications running under Win32s can spawn both Windows-based
and Win32-based applications by using either WinExec() or CreateProcess().
However, the Windows-based application will not get the modified
environment of the parent application.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In Win32s version 1.2 and later, WinExec() does not pass the environment to
the spawned Windows-based application (the 16-bit child). Instead, the
child receives the standard global environment strings. This allows the
Windows-based application to run, but the child does not receive the
modified environment from the parent. This seemed to be a reasonable
compromise for a bug that caused a GP Fault in the C start-up code that
comes with Microsoft C version 6.0 because most applications do not change
the environment for the child. Many application that come with Windows,
such as Write and Notepad, were compiled with C version 6.0.
<P>
If an application must modify the child's environment, it can spawn the
application using CreateProcess() and specify an explicit environment.
However, be aware that if the parent exits, the child's environment becomes
invalid. This behavior is due to the underlying Windows 3.x operating
system.
<P>
NOTE: Win32s uses a different mechanism to spawn Win32-based applications,
so the problems discussed in this article do not occur when spawning
Win32-based applications with WinExec() or CreateProcess().
