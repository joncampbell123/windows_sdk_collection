<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Windows NT Server has a set of services named "Services For Macintosh
(SFM)" that allow Apple Macintosh computers to transparently gain access to
shared files and printers that reside on Windows NT servers. Windows NT
Server also allows PC clients to gain access to these same shared files and
printers. When Macintosh clients connect to a shared directory on a Windows
NT server, SFM presents the files as though they were native to Macintosh
computers. Likewise, when PC clients connect to the shared directory, the
Windows NT server presents the files as though they were native to PC
computers.
<P>
The file system used by the Macintosh Operating System is very different
from file systems supported by Windows NT. As a result, file naming
conventions and the structure of files differ considerably between these
two systems. This article shows how SFM and Windows NT work together to
hide some of these details, and explains how Win32 applications can
properly handle files native to Macintosh clients.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
File Server for Macintosh (FSM), which is part of SFM, allows Windows and
Macintosh clients to create and open files on the same share by presenting
the files to the clients with the naming conventions used by their
operating systems. That is, regardless of which client actually created a
file, it appears as a Macintosh file to Macintosh clients and a Windows
file to Windows clients.
<P>
<P><h3>File Names</h3>
 
<P>
Some file names cannot be represented exactly when viewed by applications
from both Macintosh and Windows systems because the Macintosh and Windows
operating systems use different code pages to represent character strings
and different file naming conventions. File Server for Macintosh works with
NTFS to preserve the file semantics used by both systems by translating
illegal characters in file names so that both Macintosh and Windows clients
may access the same files.
<P>
Regardless of which type of client creates a file, NTFS stores its file
name on disk in UNICODE format. When a Macintosh client creates a file on a
share, FSM translates characters in the file name that are invalid on NTFS
into equivalent characters in the user-defined range of the UNICODE
character set so that the file name is legal on NTFS.
<P>
When a Macintosh client uses a file that it or another Macintosh client
created on an NTFS share, it will see the original name. File Server for
Macintosh maps the characters on disk from the UNICODE user-defined range
back into their original Macintosh-specific characters.
<P>
When a Macintosh client gains access to a file created by a Windows client
and that file doesn't follow the Macintosh file-naming standards, FSM maps
the invalid characters into the equivalent characters in the Macintosh code
page. The Macintosh client will then see the file with substituted
characters in its name.
<P>
UNICODE-enabled Win32 applications will see file names with characters in
the user-defined space and can open them without a problem. Windows-based
applications that use the ANSI character set will see a second mapping
from the user-defined UNICODE characters to the ANSI default character --
the question mark (?). Because the question mark is also a wild-card
character on Windows platforms, Windows applications that use the ANSI
character set will not be able to open these files.
<P>
NTFS will automatically generate short file name equivalents for long
file names created by both Macintosh and Win32 clients so that 16-bit
Windows and MS-DOS clients can gain access to them. The rules for automatic
short name generation are the same as Windows NT uses any time a long file
name is created on disk.
<P>
<P><h3>File Structures</h3>
 
<P>
Windows platforms represent files differently from the Macintosh Operating
System. File Server for Macintosh handles these differences so that
Macintosh clients see files as though they were native to Macintosh
computers, and Windows clients see them as being native to Windows
platforms. This section explains how files are represented on both
operating systems and how FSM handles them.
<P>
Windows platforms do not define the structure or interpretation of any
file's content; applications can impose any structure on the content.
Except for a very limited case, all files consist of a single stream
(linear sequence) of bytes. These files are called "flat" because they
don't have any higher-level organization. Win32 applications running on
Windows NT can create files with multiple streams on NTFS volumes only.
However, as a general rule, they should not create files with multiple
streams because they will be "flattened" when copied to volumes with the
FAT file system.
<P>
Because Win32 platforms can use different file systems, the maximum file
size depends on which file system is used. Files on the Protected-Mode FAT
file system may have a maximum size of 2 gigabytes (GB). On NTFS, the
largest file can be 17 billion GB long (2 to the 64th power bytes). Only
Win32 applications running on Windows NT can access the full range of files
larger than 2 GB.
<P>
The Macintosh Operating System uses files consisting of two linear
sequences of bytes known as forks. The data fork is used to store the
file's data and corresponds to a file created by a Win32 platform. The
resource fork is used to store information about the file, such as its icon
or the fonts used in it. Every file has both forks, but either or both may
be empty.
<P>
As far as the Macintosh Operating System is concerned, the content of the
data fork is unstructured and is subject to interpretation by applications.
The resource fork has a definite structure imposed by the Macintosh
Operating System and is used for file management purposes. The following
diagram shows how a file created by a Macintosh is structured:
<P>
<PRE>            +--------File--------+
            |                    |
            V                    V
       +------------+      +------------+
       |            |      |            |
       |    Data    |      |  Resource  |
       |    Fork    |      |    Fork    |
       |            |      |            |
       +------------+      +------------+

</PRE>When a file created by a Macintosh is stored on a Windows NT server, it is
stored in a single file that contains a stream for each fork. When Windows-
based applications gain access to a file created by a Macintosh client,
File Server for Macintosh presents only the data fork because the data fork
is the equivalent of the representation of files on Windows platforms.
Windows-based applications may not access the resource fork.
<P>
The Macintosh Operating System allows files and volumes to be as large as 2
GB.
<P>
<P><h3>Design Recommendations for Win32 Applications</h3>
 
<P>
Some Win32-based applications running on a Windows NT server need to manage
files that were created by Macintosh clients. Although File Server for
Macintosh presents files as each type of client expects to use them,
applications that manage files must do so correctly to preserve the file
names and structure for Macintosh clients. This section presents the four
most important design guidelines that you should follow to handle files
properly.

<OL><P><LI>Handle file names with UNICODE strings. This can be done either by
   making the application completely UNICODE-enabled or by explicitly
   calling the UNICODE versions of the file APIs. (UNICODE APIs end with a
   "W" as in CopyFileW.)
<P>
   Win32 applications that use file names of files created by Macintosh
   clients must use UNICODE strings to prevent problems in translating
   characters that are unique to the Macintosh. Because file names are
   stored on disk in UNICODE, when a UNICODE application uses them, the
   file name the application sees is identical to that stored on the disk.
   The application can find, copy, or move the file without forcing its
   name to be translated.
<P>
   Non-UNICODE Windows-based applications that retrieve and then store
   files by name (example operations include find, copy, and move) will
   force file names to be translated from UNICODE to ANSI and then back to
   UNICODE. During the first part of the translation, characters in the
   UNICODE user-defined space are mapped to their nearest equivalents in
   the ANSI code page. In the second part, the ANSI characters are written
   back out to disk. This process results in a file name that may not
   exactly match the original because the ANSI characters written are the
   results of the mapping, not the original characters.

<P><LI>Don't copy files created by Macintosh clients to volumes that have the
   FAT file system. The FAT file system does not support multiple streams,
   so the file will be flattened; that is, its resource fork will be lost.

<P><LI>Don't copy or rename files created by Macintosh clients from Windows 95,
   Win32s, or Windows 3.x clients. When these clients connect to the
   Windows NT server through a redirected drive letter or UNC name, they
   gain access to shared files through the clients' disk I/O systems. The
   problem with these clients is that their disk I/O systems do not support
   multiple file streams, so the files they save will be flattened, as
   described in guideline 2.
<P>
   To allow Windows 95, Win32s, and Windows 3.x clients to gain access to
   files created by Macintosh clients, the server should provide an RPC
   server or service to handle requests. The RPC server or service should
   then use the UNICODE file APIs as described in guideline 1.

<P><LI>Ensure that Win32-based applications running under Windows NT do not
   create files larger than 2 GB because Macintosh clients won't be able to
   use them.
<P>
</OL><h3>File Name Reference</h3>
 
<P>
A code page is a mapping of the numerical bytes (character codes) used to
represent strings and their representation on the display (glyphs). Because
Win32 and Macintosh systems use different code pages, some extended ASCII
characters on one system are not representable on screen in exactly the
same way on the other. For example, on the Macintosh, the glyph for
character code 0xBD is the Greek Omega character while in the Windows ANSI
code page, it is character symbol for "1/2."
<P>
The Macintosh Operating System uses the following file naming conventions:

<UL><LI>File and folder (directory) names may be up to 31 characters long; full
   pathnames are not limited to 260 characters (as they are on Win32
   platforms).

<LI>The colon (:) is used as a path separator.

<LI>File and folder names may use any characters except the colon, which is
   the path separator. Characters such as ?, *, \, and / are perfectly
   legal in Macintosh file names.

<LI>Although the Macintosh Operating System preserves the case of all file
   names, it does not distinguish between file names by case. (That is,
   file and folder names are not case-sensitive.)
<P>
</UL>Windows Platforms use two different file systems -- the Protected-Mode File
Allocation Table (FAT) file system and the New Technology File System
(NTFS). These file systems have similar naming conventions, and differ
mainly in which characters are illegal. The naming conventions listed below
apply to both FAT and NTFS unless specifically noted.

<UL><LI>File and directory names may be up to 255 characters long on FAT file
   systems and 256 characters on NTFS. Full pathnames may be up to 260
   characters long.

<LI>The backslash (\) is the path separator.

<LI>File and directory names on the Protected-Mode FAT file system may
   consist of letters, digits, spaces, and these characters:
<P>
   $%'-_@~`!{}()#&amp;+,;=[].
<P>
   Note that periods are allowed in file and directory names, as long as
   they are accompanied by other characters. For example, .text is
   perfectly legal.
<P>
   On NTFS, file and directory names may consist of any character except
   the following characters:
<P>
   "/\*?&lt;&gt;|:

<LI>Although file and directory names are not case-sensitive, their case is
   preserved.
