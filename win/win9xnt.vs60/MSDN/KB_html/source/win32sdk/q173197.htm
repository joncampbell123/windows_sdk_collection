<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you call ResetDC to change any printer setting, it appears to disable
Duplex (double-sided) printing when the target printer is a Hewlett Packard
PCL printer.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
PCL printers treat a change in paper size as a new print job that requires
the printer to be initialized. This causes the printer to eject any page
that is currently in the printer. The PCL printer drivers for Windows
assume that the page size has been changed when ResetDC is called, unless
the orientation of the page has changed.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To prevent having a page ejected when you call the ResetDC function, make
sure that the function is called only between individual sheets of paper.
Calling the ResetDC function before printing odd-numbered pages is
sufficient for most applications that use duplex printing. However, some
applications require that you change the page orientation on a page-by-page
basis. In this case, you can call ResetDC between individual sheets of
paper if the orientation has changed.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Note that when this problem occurs the print job continues and the sheets
of paper are passed through the printer's duplexer, but the sheets are only
printed on one side.
<P>
Because of the page size initialization requirement for PCL printers,
Windows PCL drivers treat the ResetDC function differently. These drivers
allow only the orientation to change between the front and back pages of a
sheet of paper. This means that ResetDC will eject the page unless the
orientation (and only the orientation) has changed from the previous page.
Calling ResetDC with a DEVMODE buffer that has not changed causes the
printer to eject the page.
<P>
In general, you should only call ResetDC when printer settings change.
Calling ResetDC for every page when the DEVMODE buffer has not changed is
unnecessary. By doing so, you risk having a page ejected from the printer,
which has a high probability of occurring.
