The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Win32 Application Programming Interface (API) included with:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Microsoft Windows NT versions 3.1, 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0
</UL></PRE> 
<P>
The documentation for CreateNamedPipe() indicates that
<P>
<PRE>   The input and output buffer sizes are advisory. The actual buffer
   size reserved for each end of the named pipe is either the system
   default, the system minimum or maximum, or the specified size
   rounded up to the next allocation boundary.

</PRE>The buffer size specified should be a reasonable size so that your process
will not run out of nonpaged pool, but it should also be large enough to
accommodate typical requests.
<P>
Every time a named pipe is created, the system creates the inbound and/or
outbound buffers using nonpaged pool, which is the physical memory used by
the kernel. The number of pipe instances (as well as objects such as
threads and processes) that you can create is limited by the available
nonpaged pool. Each read or write request requires space in the buffer for
the read or write data, plus additional space for the internal data
structures.
<P>
Whenever a pipe write operation occurs, the system first tries to charge
the memory against the pipe write quota. If the remaining pipe write quota
is enough to fulfill the request, the write completes immediately.
<P>
If the remaining pipe write quota is too small to fulfill the request, the
system will try to expand the buffers to accommodate the data using
nonpaged pool reserved for the process. The write will block until the data
is read from the pipe so that the additional buffer quota can be released.
Therefore, if your specified buffer size is too small, the system will grow
the buffer as needed, but the downside is that the operation will block. If
the operation is overlapped, a system thread is blocked; otherwise, the
application thread is blocked.
