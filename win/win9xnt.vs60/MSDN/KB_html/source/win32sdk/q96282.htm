<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The dmSpecVersion field of the DEVMODE structure is intended for printer
driver use only; no application programs should test this field. The
purpose of this field is for new printer drivers to be able to recognize
and handle DEVMODE structures created according to previous DEVMODE
structure specification.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The DEVMODE structure is used for printer and (occasionally) display
drivers when initializing. This structure is tied to the driver--not the
operating system. The dmSpecVersion field does not allow an application to
determine which platform (Windows version 3.1, Windows on Windows, Win32)
the application is running in.
<P>
When an application fills a DEVMODE structure, it should set the
dmSpecVersion field to DM_SPECVERSION. This identifies the version of the
DEVMODE structure the application is generating.
<P>
If the application is querying to understand an unknown device, then
special attention should be paid to the dmFields, dmSize, and dmDriverExtra
fields. These fields are a reliable means of understanding what fields in
the DEVMODE structure are readable.
<P>
The DEVMODE structure consists of public and private parts. The
dmSpecVersion field applies to the public part. Any previously defined
fields are not altered when the DEVMODE specification is updated--more
fields are merely added to the end of the structure. This can mean fields
used in the previous specification are ignored in a later specification.
This functionality is managed by one bitfield describing what fields a
driver actually uses. The new drivers just switch off the obsolete fields.
<P>
Applications using DEVMODE should always use the dmSize and dmDriverExtra
fields for allocating/storing/manipulating the structure. These fields
define the sizes of the public and private parts of the structure,
respectively.
