<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When ownership of a file is taken, the user performing the operation
becomes the new owner. The exception to this rule is when the user is a
member of the "Administrators" group. In this situation, the ownership of
the file is assigned to the Administrators group.
<P>
The reasoning for this behavior is that the administrators on a particular
system work together. When one administrator takes ownership of a file, the
others should also receive access.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When a take-ownership operation is performed, the system assigns the new
owner SID based on the TOKEN_OWNER field of the user s access token.
<P>
When a user logs on to a Windows NT system, the logon process builds an
access token to represent the user. Normally the TOKEN_OWNER field in the
access token is set equal to TOKEN_USER (the user s SID). However, when the
user is a member of the Administrators group, the system sets the
TOKEN_OWNER field to the Administrators SID.
<P>
Although Windows NT does not provide a user interface for changing the
TOKEN_OWNER field in the user s access token, it is possible to
programatically change this value via the SetTokenInformation() Win32 API
(application programming interface).
