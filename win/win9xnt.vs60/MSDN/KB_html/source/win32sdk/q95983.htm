<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Sometimes more than one DDEML client application might establish an
advise loop with a server on the same topic!item!format name set. This
article discusses the complexities involved in such a transaction.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
A client application sends an XTYP_ADVSTART to DDEML when it needs
periodic updates on a particular data item from a server, typically
when that particular data item's value changes.
<P>
The server application calls DdePostAdvise whenever the value of the
requested data item changes. This results in an XTYP_ADVREQ
transaction being sent to the server's DDEML callback function, where
the server returns a handle to the changed data.
<P>
The client then receives the updated data item during the XTYP_ADVDATA
transaction in the case of a hot advise loop. In a warm advise loop,
the XTYP_ADVDATA transaction that the client receives in its callback
does not contain data; it has to specifically request data with an
XTYP_REQUEST transaction.
<P>
When more than one client application requests an advise loop on the
same topic!item!format name set, DDEML maintains a list of these
client applications so that it knows that on one call to
DdePostAdvise(), it should send the changed hData to all the
requesting applications in its list.
<P>
The server's callback receives an XTYP_ADVREQ transaction as a result
of DdePostAdvise() with the LOWORD (dwData1) containing a count of the
number of ADVREQ transactions remaining to be processed on the same
topic!item!format name set.
<P>
This count allows the server application to create its hData as
HDATA_APPOWNED, whereby it could create a data handle just once and
pass the same handle on to its other pending requests on the same
topic!item!format name set. Finally, when the count is down to zero,
DdeFreeDataHandle() can then be called on this hData.
<P>
Note that a server needs to call DdePostAdvise() only once regardless
of how many pending advise requests it has on the same
topic!item!format name set. This one call to DdePostAdvise() causes
DDEML to send the appropriate number of XTYP_ADVREQ transactions to
the server's callback.
<P>
All these can be easily illustrated using the Windows version 3.1 Software
Development Kit (SDK) DDEML CLIENT and SERVER samples in this manner:

<OL><P><LI>Start the SERVER application.

<P><LI>a. Start the CLIENT application.
   b. Establish a connection with the SERVER.
   c. Start an advise loop on the item "Rand".

<P><LI>a. Start another instance of the client application.
   b. Establish a connection with the SERVER.
   c. Start an advise loop on the item Rand.

<P><LI>Bring up DDESPY.

<P><LI>Go back to the SERVER and choose ChangeData from the Options menu and
   watch both CLIENT applications update their data.
<P>
</OL>Results (from DDESPY main window):

<OL><P><LI>Two XTYP_ADVREQs (because you have two pending ADVREQs on the same
   test!Rand pair.

<P><LI>Changed Rand data is then sent to the first CLIENT in the advise list.

<P><LI>The first CLIENT in the advise list receives the data via XTYP_ADVDATA.

<P><LI>Changed "Rand" data is sent to the second CLIENT in the advise list.

<P><LI>The second CLIENT in the advise list receives its XTYP_ADVDATA.
<P>
</OL>One caveat to this scenario is when an advise loop is invoked with the
XTYPF_ACKREQ flag set (that is, the client establishes an
XTYP_ADVSTART transaction or'ed with the XTYPF_ACKREQ flag). In this
case, the server does not send the next data item until an ACK is
received from the client for the first data item. During a particular
call to DdePostAdvise(), the server might not necessarily receive
XTYP_ADVREQ in its callback for all active links, and the
LOWORD(dwData1) might not necessarily reach 0 (zero). When the
DDE_FACK from the client finally arrives, DDEML then sends the server
an XTYP_ADVREQ with LOWORD(dwData1) set to CADV_LATEACK, identifying
the late-arriving ACK appropriately.
<P>
Advise links of this kind (with XTYPF_ACKREQ flag set) are best suited
to situations where the server sends information faster than a client
can process it--setting the XTYPF_ACKREQ bit ensures that the server
never outruns the client. However, setting this flag also sets a
drawback in circumstances where data transitions may be lost. Thus, in
Windows NT or in similar situations where server outrun is highly
unlikely, it is recommended that the XTYPF_ACKREQ bit not be used to
prevent such data transition loss.
<P>
Note that in this delayed ACK update scenario, the count received in
the LOWORD (dwData1) may not be relied upon for creating APPOWNED data
handles as discussed in the earlier paragraphs; where an hData is
created once, and when the count is down to zero, DdeFreeDataHandle()
is called on this hData.
<P>
This does not, however, imply that the efficiency provided by APPOWNED
data handles may not be used at all. In this case, a server could
create an APPOWNED data handle once--usually on the first XTYP_ADVREQ
it receives--and associate that handle with a topic!item!format name
set. It could then return this data handle for all subsequent requests
it receives on this topic!item!format set. Each time data changes
thereafter, the server should destroy the old data handle and not
re-render the data [that is, call DdeCreateDataHandle()] until another
request comes through.
<P>
This might be better explained as follows:
<P>
<PRE>      case XTYP_ADVREQ:
           if (ThisIsForTheTopicItemFormatSpecified)
           {
               if (bFirstTimeRequested)
                  {
                      bFirstTimeRequested = FALSE;
                      hData = DdeCreateDataHandle();
                   }
                return hData;
            }
            break;

     // and then whenever data changes for this topic!item!format
         if (hData)
           {
             DdeFreeDataHandle (hData);
             bFirstTimeRequested = TRUE;
            }
         DdePostAdvise();         // specify topic!item!format here.
                                  // This causes DDEML to send an
</PRE></OL>XTYP_ADVREQ
<PRE>                                  // which is handled above.

</PRE>For Microsoft Windows version 3.1 DDEML, the only way for a server
application to distinguish which client's advise request is currently
being responded to is through the XTYP_ADVREQ's hConv parameter. The
hConvPartner field of the CONVINFO structure may be used to
distinguish between clients.
