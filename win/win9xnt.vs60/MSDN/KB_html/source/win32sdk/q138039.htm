<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
An application's attempt to use name registration and the resolution API
GetService is unsuccessful. Service names, other than those on the local
computer, cannot be found.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
GetService does not work for both Windows NT build 1057 and Windows 95
build 950.6. GetService is designed to enumerate through all name space
providers to query a service. However, none of the providers currently
implement GetService helper functions.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Use GetAddressByName. Alternately, for NetWare services, send SAP packets
manually using WinSock. Use gethostbyname for TCP/IP services.
<P>
The best workaround is to call GetAddressByName, which can obtain addresses
for TCP/IP services, NetWare services and NetBIOS names. GetAddressByName
takes service names and global unique identifiers (GUID) just as GetService
does, and it returns the associated address for that service.
<P>
Another workaround is to query each name space independently. For example,
you might send out a SAP query to NetWare services for services registered
in the Bindery or NDS for a NetWare server. To learn more about SAP
queries, refer to the IPX router specification provided by Novell.
<P>
To find the IP address of a TCP/IP service, you can use gethostbyname in
the WinSock API. Your service must be registered in the DNS database.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed
at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will
post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
