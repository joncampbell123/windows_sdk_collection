<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
To close a Winsock server and rebind a new server to its old port you need
to employ setsockopt() on the server socket with SO_REUSEADDR. However,
this becomes problematic if the server spawned incoming clients into child
processes for handling. If any child processes are left open with their
socket connection intact, any future client connection requests to any new
server will be forcefully refused (WSAECONNREFUSED).
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When the server calls closesocket(), the Windows NT TCP/IP address object
connect handler address is set to NULL, which causes TCP/IP to send a
TCP/IP Reset (RST) when future clients attempt to connect to the server's
port number.
<P>
When a new server is created and reopens the same port, this causes the
Windows NT TCP/IP driver to create a duplicate address object with a valid
connect handler address. However, connection requests are validated against
the old TCP/IP address object, which still has a NULL connect handler.
<P>
The end result is that all future client connection requests are forcefully
refused (WSAECONNREFUSED) as long as child processes from the original
server maintain their socket connections through the original NT TCP/IP
address object. Once they all close, the original object is destroyed and
normal operation resumes.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed
at the beginning of this article. We are researching this bug and will post
new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create a Winsock server application.

<P><LI>Upon accepting a client connection, set its handle inheritable, spawn a
   child process. Actual use of the socket is irrelevant. The inherited
   handle keeps the socket connection alive via the additional reference.

<P><LI>Terminate the server/parent process, recreate the server process
   while leaving the child process open.

<P><LI>Attempt to connect a client to the server, it should be refused.
