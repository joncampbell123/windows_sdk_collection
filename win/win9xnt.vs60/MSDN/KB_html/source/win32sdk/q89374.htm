The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Win32 Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows NT,
   versions 3.1, 3.5, and 3.51

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
There may be a difference in the byte order in which 16-bit words are
stored in memory versus the order in which the two bytes must be
transmitted onto the network as part of a data packet. This difference
will depend on the processor involved and which part of the data
packet the information falls under.
<P>
The information is this article is consistent with the Network Device
Interface Specification (NDIS) version 3.0.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Consider that the data will consist of header(s), the application
data, and a trailer(s).
<P>
<PRE>      -------------------------------
      |    |    |                |    |------- Trailer
      -------------------------------
        |    |          |____ Application data
        |    |
        |    |____ Header
        |
        |____ Header

</PRE>When a protocol driver or an NDIS driver sends information, it does
not modify the application data, nor does it modify the ordering of
bytes in integer fields.
<P>
The ordering of bytes in integer fields within the application data is
the responsibility of the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) facility or
another mechanism. However, the driver should be concerned with how
the information in the header(s)/trailer(s) is stored. For example,
the driver may be required to put a 16-bit checksum in a header. To
put that integer value into the header in the format required by the
network specification, the driver may need to know the type of
processor that it is running on and will in any case need to follow
the network standard for storing the information in the header.
