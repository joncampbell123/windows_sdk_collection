The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows
   versions 3.0 and 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Win32 SDK, versions 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
One of the things that reduces the training required to learn Windows is
the presence of consistent graphical help. You can create Help files that
use graphic images as context jumps or as glossary pop-ups.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To use a graphic as a context jump, perform the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Create the graphic in your favorite graphics editor. The typical
   Windows developer has at least two tools available for this
   purpose:
<P>
   a. Windows Paintbrush, included with the retail release of Windows
<P>
   b. SDKPaint, provided with the Windows SDK
<P>
   A Note to Paintbrush Users
   --------------------------
<P>
   When an image is saved from Paintbrush, by default, the entire
   "canvas" is saved to disk, not just the image created. To work
   around this potential problem, after the image is complete, use the
   square outline tool (at the upper right of the tool bar) to select
   the image. If the image is not square, select the smallest bounding
   rectangle, leaving a border if desired. From the Edit menu, choose
   Copy To, and fill in the name of the file in which to save the
   selection.

<P><LI>Edit the file that contains the Help text. This is often called the
   .RTF file.

<P><LI>Place the cursor where the graphic should occur and turn on the
   strikethrough character format feature of the text editor. Word
   for Windows users should use double underline character formatting
   instead.

<P><LI>Insert one of the following text strings:
<P>
<P><PRE>      {bmc &lt;filename&gt;}
      -or-
      {bml &lt;filename&gt;}
      -or-
      {bmr &lt;filename&gt;}
</PRE><P>
   This text should be struck through (or double underlined).

<P><LI>Turn off the strikethrough (or double underline) character format
   and turn on hidden text character formatting.

<P><LI>Type the context string for the jump destination.

<P><LI>Turn off hidden text character formatting.

<P><LI>Save the .RTF file.

<P><LI>Edit the .HPJ file. There must be a [BITMAPS] section in this file,
   and that section must include the name of the bitmap used above.
<P>
</OL>When the Help file is built, clicking the graphic with the mouse will
cause Help to change to the specified context.
<P>
If the graphic has a name or other short text description, we
recommend that the text also be coded as a context jump. This way, the
user can click on either the graphic or the text to perform the jump.
The text also provides a means for users without a mouse to perform
the jump.
<P>
More information on Windows Help files is in Chapters 15 through 19 of
the "Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit Tools" manual. Chapter
17 discusses context jumps, glossary pop-ups, and inserting graphics
into the Help file by reference.
