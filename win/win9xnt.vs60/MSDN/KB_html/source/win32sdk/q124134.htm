The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Win32s, versions 1.30, 1.30a, 1.30c
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The entry point for both Windows-based and Win32-based applications is:
<P>
<PRE>   int WinMain( hInstance, hPrevInstance, lpszCmdLine, nCmdShow )

   HINSTANCE hInstance;        /* Handle of current instance  */
   HINSTANCE hPrevInstance;    /* Handle of previous instance */
   LPSTR lpszCmdLine;          /* Address of command line     */
   int nCmdShow;               /* Show state of window        */

</PRE>You can allow only one instance of your Windows-based application to run
at a time by using hPrevInstance to determine if there is already an
existing application instance; then exit the process if there is one. If
there is no previous instance, hPrevInstance is NULL.
<P>
However, in a Win32-based application, hPrevInstance is always NULL.
Therefore, you cannot determine if another instance of your application
has been started simply by examining hPrevInstance. This article gives you
a method you can use.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Use one of the following four methods to determine if there is an existing
application instance on Win32s:

<UL><LI>Synchronize with a named object, such as a file mapping.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Synchronize with a global atom.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Synchronize with a private message.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Use FindWindow() to check for the application.
<P>
</UL><h3>Using a File Mapping</h3>
 
<P>
Using a file mapping works well on any Win32 platform. The global atom is a
cheaper resource, whereas a file mapping will cost a page of memory. A
private message is good if you want to inform the first instance that the
user attempted to start a second instance, and then let it handle the
request -- post a message, become the active application, and so on.
<P>
NOTE: You need to clean up before terminating the second instance.
FindWindow() doesn't require cleanup, but this method will not work as
reliably in a preemptive multitasking environment, such as Windows NT,
because you can get in a race condition.
<P>
The following code fragment demonstrates how a file mapping can be used
to allow only one instance of a Win32-based application. This code should
avoid any race conditions. Place this code at the beginning of WinMain().
<P>
The code creates a file mapping named MyTestMap using CreateFileMapping().
If MyTestMap already exists, then you know that there is already a running
instance of this application. A similar technique would be used with a
global atom.
<P>
<P><h3>Sample Code</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   HANDLE hMapping;

   hMapping = CreateFileMapping( (HANDLE) 0xffffffff,
                                 NULL,
                                 PAGE_READONLY,
                                 0,
                                 32,
                                 "MyTestMap" );
   if( hMapping )
   {
      if( GetLastError() == ERROR_ALREADY_EXISTS )
      {
      //
      // Display something that tells the user
      // the app is already running.
      //
         MessageBox( NULL, "Application is running.", "Test", MB_OK );
         ExitProcess(1);
      }
   }
   else
   {
   //
   // Some other error; handle error.
   //
      MessageBox( NULL, "Error creating mapping", "Test", MB_OK );
      ExitProcess(1);
   }
