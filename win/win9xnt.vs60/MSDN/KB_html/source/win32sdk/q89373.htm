<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Under Windows 3.1, the Task Manager is an easily replaceable program.
However, under the Win32 subsystem of Windows NT, it is very difficult to
replace the Task Manager, due to special programming considerations. In
general, it is not recommended that users attempt this.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Special requirements for the Task Manager make it very different from the
Windows 3.1 Task Manager. The EndTask button handling is done through
internal application programming interface (API) functions. These API
functions are not documented. The situation is the same for handling
foreground management, hung applications, and priority issues (to make sure
that the Task Manager will come up as fast as possible). In addition, the
Windows NT Task Manager uses shortcut ("hot") keys.
<P>
In Windows NT 3.1, the Task List has been incorporated into the Program
Manager. To remove the Task List, you must also remove the Program Manager.
The full functionality of the Task List (as found in TASKMAN.EXE) is now
folded into the Program Manager (PROGMAN.EXE). If you completely delete the
TASKMAN.EXE file from your system and from the registry location
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\
      SOFTWARE\
      Microsoft\
      Windows NT\
      CurrentVersion\
      WinLogon\
      Shell

</PRE>you will still be able to invoke the Task List because it is built into the
Program Manager.
<P>
In Windows NT 3.5, Program Manager checks the registry for a Taskman entry.
If the Taskman entry is found, Program Manager will launch the application,
instead of using its built-in Taskman. The registry entry is:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\
      SOFTWARE\
      Microsoft\
      Windows NT\
      CurrentVersion\
      Winlogon\
      Taskman

</PRE>This entry does not not exist by default. You will have to create this
value, with type REG_SZ.
