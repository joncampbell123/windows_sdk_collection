The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Win32 Application Programming Interface (API) included
   with Microsoft Windows 95, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The thunk compiler supports most of the built-in and user-defined types
that the C or C++ languages support. It also supports a subset of the
calling conventions that the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler supports. To
handle situations where you need to pass or return data of an unsupported
type, you need to massage the data into a type that the thunk compiler does
recognize. This article explains how to do so for commonly used types
supported by the C and C++ languages but not by the thunk compiler.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
There are several strategies for handling data types and function calling
conventions that the thunk compiler does not support. These strategies
generally rely on substitution and pre- or post-processing the data, and
require an understanding of how the thunk compiler translates data. The
thunk compiler uses the following rules to translate data:

<UL><LI>Automatically translate 32-bit pointers into 16-bit far pointers and
   vice-versa.

<LI>Pass signed and unsigned scalar types (varieties of char, int, and long)
   unmodified with the exception of int. Because the type int is 32 bits
   wide in 32-bit code and 16 bits wide in 16-bit code, truncate int values
   on the 16-bit side, and sign-extend them on the 32-bit side.
<P>
</UL>These two translation rules make thunks handle parameters as expected in C
or C++. A pointer is a pointer on both sides, and a scalar value is the
same on both sides too. These rules come in handy when you need to use the
Generic Thunk API functions in combination with flat thunks.
<P>
Before delving into how to handle specific data types, you need to consider
the general principles for substituting function calling conventions and
data types. These are simple:

<UL><LI>Write wrapper functions around the thunk to handle unsupported calling
   conventions.

<LI>Substitute supported types for unsupported types in the thunk scripts.
   The supported type must be the same length as the unsupported type, and
   generally should not be a pointer type.

<LI>If the unsupported type is larger than eight bytes, then it usually
   should be handled by passing a pointer to it and then manually
   interpreting it on the other side of the thunk. Unions and arrays of
   structures fall into this category.

<LI>To handle unsupported types in return values, write wrapper functions
   for both sides of the thunk and where necessary, give the actual thunk
   function an extra parameter that points to a dynamically-allocated
   buffer.
<P>
</UL><h3>Function Calling Conventions</h3>
 
<P>
The Windows 95 thunk compiler supports a subset of the calling conventions
supported by the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler. Only __stdcall is supported
on the 32-bit side of a thunk; on the 16-bit side, only __pascal is
supported. __cdecl and __fastcall are not supported calling conventions for
either the 16-bit or 32-bit sides of the thunk. Although the thunk must use
__pascal and __stdcall calling conventions, the thunk may call or be called
by other functions that use any calling convention.
<P>
To thunk to a function that uses the __cdecl or __fastcall calling
convention, you must create your thunk function with the supported calling
conventions and have the target side of the thunk call the real function.
Here is an example that shows how a Win32 application might call a 16-bit
__cdecl function:
<P>
<PRE>/*-------------------------------------------------------------
</PRE>Code inside Win32 application or DLL
-------------------------------------------------------------*/
<P>
<PRE>/*
   Declaration for benefit of the 32-bit side of thunk, note
   that in Win32 programs, PASCAL is defined as __stdcall,
   and FAR is defined as nothing.
*/
void FAR PASCAL C_Function16 (int x);

/*
   MyCFunction is a C calling convention function to interface
   with rest of the Win32 application.  It calls the thunk,
   which is __stdcall.
*/
void MyCFunction (int x)
</PRE>{
<PRE>   C_Function16 (x);
</PRE>}
<P>
<PRE>/*-------------------------------------------------------------
</PRE>Code inside Win16 DLL (target of thunk)
-------------------------------------------------------------*/
<P>
<PRE>// Declaration for the real C function
void Real_C_Function (int x);

/*
   C_Function16 is the 16-bit side of the thunk.  In a 32-&gt;16
   thunk, it is the target.  Here, it calls the real C function
   that the Win32 application wanted to call in the first
   place. The FAR macro and the __export keyword are used to
   make sure the function is exported correctly from the 16-bit
   DLL.
*/
void FAR PASCAL __export C_Function16 (int x)
</PRE>{
<PRE>   Real_C_Function (x);
</PRE>}
<P>
<P>
<PRE>/*-------------------------------------------------------------
</PRE>Thunk script
-------------------------------------------------------------*/
enablemapdirect3216 = true;
<P>
<PRE>void C_Function16 (int x)
</PRE>{
}
<P>
If you try to build a thunk and don't use the __stdcall or __pascal calling
conventions, you will get "unresolved external" errors from the linker when
building because the function names produced by the C/C++ compiler don't
match the names in the code produced by the thunk compiler.
<P>
<P><h3>Return Values</h3>
 
<P>
The thunk compiler does not support all types as return values that the C
and C++ languages support. The limitations stem from the problems of
translating addresses from 32-bit address spaces to 16-bit address spaces
and vice-versa.
<P>
The thunk compiler supports returning all integral types. The signed and
unsigned varieties of char, short int, and long int are the same size on
both sides of a thunk and thus are returned unmodified. The values of the
<PRE>int type will be truncated to 16-bits upon return from a 16-&gt;32 thunk, and
</PRE>will be sign-extended to 32-bits on return from a 32-&gt;16 thunk.
<P>
Structures may not be returned from either 32-&gt;16 or 16-&gt;32 thunks.
However, pointers to structures can be returned from 32-&gt;16 thunks if the
structure does not need to be repacked and does not contain pointers. A
structure does not require repacking if the types of all members of the
structure are the same size in 16-bit and 32-bit code and the structure is
packed with the same alignment on both sides of the thunk. Use #pragma pack
to pack the structure with the same value in the 32-bit and 16-bit source
code, and specify the same packing on the thunk compiler command line.
<P>
Pointers cannot be returned from 16-&gt;32 thunks because the context of the
32-bit address space is not global. The 32-bit address space for the Win32
target DLL is mapped between 4 megabytes and 2 gigabytes, and it is context-
switched as are all other Win32 process address spaces. This means that a
Win16 application or DLL could not use a pointer returned by a 16-&gt;32 thunk
without causing a general protection (GP) fault. You can work around this
limitation by writing a wrapper function for the 16-bit side of the thunk
that allocates memory and passes it to the thunk function as an extra
parameter. The 32-bit side of the thunk should also be a wrapper around the
real function to handle the extra parameter and copy the data to the memory
allocated by the 16-bit wrapper function.
<P>
Pointers are supported as return types in 32-&gt;16 thunks as long as the base
type requires the same number of bytes on both sides of the thunk and does
not require repacking. If the size of the base type of a pointer differs
between the Win16 and Win32 sides, the thunk compiler generates an error.
For example, a char is one byte on both sides of the thunk, and thus a
pointer to a char is supported as a return type. A pointer to an int cannot
be returned because an int is 16 bits on the 16-bit side of the thunk, but
32 bits on the 32-bit side.
<P>
To return a pointer to a data type whose size is different on the 16-bit
and 32-bit sides of a 32-&gt;16 thunk, you should write a wrapper function
that returns the real type, and have the wrapper pass a buffer to the thunk
function as an extra parameter. The target side of the thunk should put the
return value into this buffer, and then the wrapper on the calling side
should return the data from the buffer once the target side of the thunk
returns.
<P>
The thunk compiler has one special type (bool) that is not found in C or
C++ compilers. You should use this type in your thunk scripts for functions
that return boolean values when the TRUE result is any non-zero value.
<P>
<P><h3>Floating-Point Data Types</h3>
 
<P>
The thunk compiler does not support any floating point types. There are
three floating point types to consider, and how you approach them depends
on which you need to use.
<P>
A float is four bytes long on both the 16-bit and 32-bit sides of a thunk.
A float can be passed to a thunk function by declaring it as a DWORD
(unsigned long) in the thunk script. This makes the thunk compiler pass a
four byte value without translating its value.
<P>
A double is eight bytes long on both the 16-bit and 32-bit sides of the
thunk. To pass a double to a thunk function, declare a struct containing
two DWORDs (unsigned longs) in the thunk script, and pass the struct into
the function in the thunk script. Here is an example 32-&gt;16 thunk:
<P>
<PRE>/*-------------------------------------------------------------
</PRE>Code on Win32 side of thunk
-------------------------------------------------------------*/
<P>
<PRE>/*
   Declaration for the benefit of the 32-bit side of thunk,
   note that in Win32 programs, PASCAL is defined as __stdcall,
   and FAR is defined as nothing.
*/
</PRE>double FAR PASCAL sqr16 (double x);
<P>
double sqr32 (double x)
{
<PRE>   return(sqr16 (x));
</PRE>}
<P>
<P>
<PRE>/*-------------------------------------------------------------
</PRE>Code inside Win16 DLL (target of thunk)
-------------------------------------------------------------*/
<P>
<PRE>/*
   sqr16() is the 16-bit side of the thunk. In a 32-&gt;16 thunk,
   it is the target. The FAR macro and the __export keyword
   are used to make sure it is exported correctly from the 16-bit
   DLL.
*/
</PRE>double FAR PASCAL __export sqr16 (double x)
{
<PRE>   return (x * x);
</PRE>}
<P>
<P>
<PRE>/*-------------------------------------------------------------
</PRE>Thunk script
-------------------------------------------------------------*/
enablemapdirect3216 = true;
typedef unsigned long DWORD;
typedef struct _MYDOUBLE
{
<PRE>   DWORD dwLow;
   DWORD dwHigh;
</PRE>} MYDOUBLE;
<P>
MYDOUBLE sqr16 (MYDOUBLE x)
{
}
<P>
<P>
In 16-bit code, a long double is a native 80-bit type of the floating point
processors in the Intel x86 microprocessor family. Because RISC processors
do not have a native 80-bit floating point type, C and C++ compilers for
Win32 platforms such as Microsoft Visual C++ implement this type as a
64-bit double. If you cannot tolerate the loss of precision of converting
80-bit long doubles to 64-bit doubles, then you should pass the 80-bit
value as a structure consisting of two DWORDs (unsigned longs) and a WORD
(unsigned short), and you will have to handle the value manually on the
32-bit side of the thunk.
<P>
<P><h3>Pointers</h3>
 
<P>
The thunk compiler automatically translates pointers to most types. It
properly handles pointers to the following data types:

<UL><LI>All scalar data types
<LI>Structures
<LI>Pointers within structures if the object pointed to does not require
   repacking (such as the int type).
<P>
</UL>Pointers to pointers are translated partially. The "outside" pointer is
translated, but the pointer it points to -- the "inside" pointer-- is not
translated.
<P>
The thunk compiler does not handle all cases of pointers used in aggregate
types, such as arrays of pointers.
<P>
Finally, the thunk compiler places limitations on pointers as return values
as described in the "Return Values" section earlier in this article.
<P>
There may be times when you want to pass an address without having it
translated. Because the thunk compiler automatically translates pointers,
you should use the DWORD type instead of a pointer type to pass addresses
that you don't want translated. Then, you can use the untranslated address
on the target side of the thunk, possibly in calls to the Generic Thunk
APIs. However, keep in mind that addresses that have not been translated
will cause an access violation if dereferenced on the target side of the
thunk.
<P>
<P><h3>Unions and C++ Classes</h3>
 
<P>
Unions are not supported by the thunk compiler because it cannot determine
which type the union will actually hold at run time. For example, the
following union must be treated differently by the thunk compiler depending
on which member the application was actually using when it made the thunk
call:
<P>
<PRE>   union
   {
      DWORD dwIntegerValue;
      LPSTR szFileName;
   }

</PRE>The problem the thunk compiler has with this union is whether it should
generate code to pass the value unchanged, assuming that the dwIntegerValue
member will be used, or to translate the value as a pointer, assuming that
szFileName will be used. Because the thunk compiler cannot make this
determination, it cannot generate the correct code to handle this union.
You should handle union types in thunks by declaring a structure in the
thunk script large enough to hold the union, and then handle the union's
data manually on both sides of the thunk.
<P>
Do not thunk C++ objects. Objects are not supported by the thunk compiler
because there isn't any way to reliably pass them as parameters to thunks.
In addition to specifying the object's physical layout, a class may also
define a vtable which contains addresses of all the class's virtual
functions. Because all objects of a class share a single vtable, there is
no way to translate the vtable so that it can be used by some objects that
have been thunked and others that haven't.
<P>
<P><h3>Linked Lists and other Dynamic Data Structures</h3>
 
<P>
Although the thunk compiler supports structures with pointers, it does not
provide a way to handle linked lists and other dynamic structures. This is
because the thunk compiler must know the size of the data it translates at
compile time, but the number of elements that dynamically-allocated
structures contain is indeterminate at compile time.
