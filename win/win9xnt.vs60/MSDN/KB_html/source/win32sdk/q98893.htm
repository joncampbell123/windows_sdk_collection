<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
There is a limit to the number of bytes that can be written with
WriteFile() using asynchronous I/O (FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED specified). This
limit depends on the size of your system.
<P>
Asynchronous (overlapped) I/O consumes system resources for a long time.
For example, the memory used is locked in the process working set until the
I/O completes. To limit the amount of system resources used asynchronously
by an application, the system charges asynchronous I/O to the working set
of the process requesting the I/O.
<P>
While the working set size is dynamically raised and lowered based on the
load, there are minimum and maximum values. These values are based on
system size: consider up to 12 megabytes (MB) a small system, between 12 MB
and 19 MB a medium system, and greater than 19 MB a large system. Each
process is guaranteed a minimum working set for performance reasons; about
120K for small systems, 160K for large systems, and 245K for large systems.
<P>
When system resources are heavily taxed, a process is confined to its
maximum working set. Asynchronous I/Os may never cause you to exceed your
maximum working set, because once you are allowed to initiate an
asynchronous I/O, the page cannot be taken away if memory becomes tight.
The maximum working set sizes are about 300K for a small system, 716K for a
medium system, and 1.5 MB for a large system.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following code can be used to experiment with the maximum number of
bytes that can be written using asynchronous I/O. Simply change the line to
vary the number of bytes that the code attempts to write:
