<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
A Windows combo box is a compound structure composed of individual windows.
Three types of windows can be created as part of a combo box:

<UL><LI>A combo box itself, of window class "ComboBox"
<LI>An edit control, of window class "Edit"
<LI>A list box, of window class "ComboLBox"
<P>
</UL>The relationship among these three windows varies depending upon the
different combo box styles.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
For combo boxes created with the CBS_SIMPLE styles, the ComboBox window is
the parent of the edit control and the list box that is always displayed on
the screen. When GetWindowRect() is called for a combo box of this style,
the rectangle returned contains the edit control and the list box.
<P>
Combo boxes created with the CBS_DROPDOWNLIST style have no edit control.
The region of the combo box that displays the current selection is in the
ComboBox window itself. When GetWindowRect() is called for a combo box of
this style, the rectangle returned does not include the list box.
<P>
For combo boxes created with the CBS_DROPDOWN style, three windows are
created. The combo box edit control is a child of the ComboBox window. When
GetWindowRect() is called for a combo box of this style, the rectangle
returned does not include the list box.
<P>
However, the ComboLBox (list box) window for combo boxes that have the
CBS_DROPDOWN or CBS_DROPDOWNLIST style is not a child of the ComboBox
window. Instead, each ComboLBox window is a child of the desktop window.
This is required so that, when the drop-down list box is dropped, it can
extend outside the application window or dialog box. Otherwise, the list
box would be clipped at the window or dialog box border.
<P>
Because the ComboLBox window is not a child of the ComboBox window, there
is no simple method to get the handle of one window, given the other. For
example, given a handle to the ComboBox, the handle to any associated drop-
down list box is not readily available. The ComboLBox is a private class
registered by USER that is a list box with the class style CS_SAVEBITS.
