The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Win32 Application Programming Interface (API) included with:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Microsoft Windows NT versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0
</UL></PRE> 
<P>
A user that is a member of the Administrator group is not automatically
granted access to any file on the local machine. For an administrator to
access a file, permission must be specifically granted (as for any user) in
the file's discretionary access control list (DACL).
<P>
If an administrator wants to access a file that he or she is not granted
access to, the administrator must first take ownership of that file. Once
ownership is taken, the administrator will have full access to the file. It
is important to note that administrator cannot give ownership back to the
original owner. If this were so, the administrator could take ownership of
a file, examine it, and then assign it back to the original owner without
that owner's knowledge.
<P>
NOTE: Because administrators have backup privileges, an administrator could
back up a file (or entire volume) and restore it onto another system. The
administrator could then take ownership of a file on this new system,
examine it, and then restore from backup with original permissions, without
the owner's knowledge. Please keep this in mind when thinking about file
security.
