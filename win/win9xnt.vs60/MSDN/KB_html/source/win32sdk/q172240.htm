The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Win32 Application Programming Interface (API) included with:
   - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning, Professional, and Enterprise Editions
<P><PRE>     for Windows, version 5.0
</UL></PRE> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
You can open a file multiple times in different applications as long as one
application does not have exclusive access to the file. There may be times
when your application needs to have exclusive access to a file, and the
application may need to determine whether it is already open. This article
explains how to determine whether a file is already open. It also contains
two versions of a function you can use to detect whether a file is already
open.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The only sure way your application can determine whether it can open a file
exclusively is by trying to open the file. If you are able to open the
file, your application has exclusive access. Otherwise, it doesn't.
<P>
If your application needs to determine whether a file is already open, it
should attempt to open the file for exclusive-sharing access. If a sharing
violation occurs during the attempt, the file is already open. If the
attempt causes a different error, such as access denied or file not found,
then your application will not be able to tell whether the file is already
open.
<P>
The function described here is called IsFileAlreadyOpen, declared as:
<P>
<PRE>   BOOL IsFileAlreadyOpen(char *filename); // In C/C++...
   Function IsFileAlreadyOpen(Filename As String) As BOOLEAN // In VB...

</PRE>If this function returns TRUE, then the file is already open. It determines
that the file is already open only if it gets ERROR_SHARING_VIOLATION when
it attempts to open the file.
<P>
It will return FALSE in the following conditions:

<UL><LI>The file is not already open.
<LI>The calling application does not have access to the file due to NTFS
   security.
<LI>The file does not exist.
<P>
</UL>You should check if the file exists before calling the function to
eliminate the possibility of the latter condition.
<P>
<P><h3>Sample Code: C/C++ version of IsFileAlreadyOpen</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   BOOL IsFileAlreadyOpen(char *filename)
   {
      HFILE theFile = HFILE_ERROR;
      DWORD lastErr  = NO_ERROR;

      // Attempt to open the file exclusively.
      theFile = _lopen(filename, OF_READ | OF_SHARE_EXCLUSIVE);

      if (theFile == HFILE_ERROR)
         // Save last error...
         lastErr = GetLastError();
      else
         // If the open was successful, close the file.
         _lclose(theFile);

      // Return TRUE if there is a sharing-violation.
      return ((theFile == HFILE_ERROR) &amp;&amp;
              (lastErr == ERROR_SHARING_VIOLATION));
   }

      lastErr = 0

      ' Open for for read and exclusive sharing.
      hFile = lopen(Filename, &amp;H10)

      ' If we couldn't open the file, get the last error.
      If hFile = -1 Then
         lastErr = Err.LastDllError
      ' Make sure we close the file on success.
      Else
         lclose (hFile)
      End If

      ' Check for sharing violation error.
      If (hFile = -1) And (lastErr = 32) Then
         IsFileAlreadyOpen = True
      Else
         IsFileAlreadyOpen = False
      End If

   End Function

various modes available and in particular, OF_SHARE_EXCLUSIVE.
