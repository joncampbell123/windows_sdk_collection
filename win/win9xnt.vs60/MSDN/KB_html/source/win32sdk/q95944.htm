<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Windows NT NetBIOS implementation conforms to the IBM NetBIOS 3.0
specifications, with several enhancements discussed in this article.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Name Table</h3>
 
<P>
Under Windows NT, the name table is maintained on a per-process basis,
which means that names added by one process are not visible by a different
process. This also means that for two processes to establish a session,
both processes must register two different NetBIOS names. However, sessions
can be established by two threads in the same process using the same
NetBIOS name.
<P>
<P><h3>NCBRESET</h3>
 
<P>
The IBM NetBIOS 3.0 specifications defines four basic NetBIOS environments
under the NCBRESET command. Win32 follows the OS/2 Dynamic Link Routine
(DLR) environment. This means that the first NCB issued by an application
must be a NCBRESET, with the exception of NCBENUM. The Windows NT
implementation differs from the IBM NetBIOS 3.0 specifications in the
NCB_CALLNAME field.
<P>
In the "IBM Local Area Network Technical Reference," under the section on
NetBIOS 3.0, the NCB_CALLNAME field is defined as the following:
<P>
<PRE>   REQ_SESSIONS at NCB_CALLNAME+0 (1-byte field)
   The number of sessions requested by the application program.
   If zero, the default of 16 is used.

   REQ_COMMANDS at NCB_CALLNAME+1 (1-byte field)
   The number of commands requested by the application program.
   If zero, the default of 16 is used.

   REQ_NAMES at NCB_CALLNAME+2 (1-byte field)
   The number of names requested by the application program. This
   does not include a reservation for NAME_NUMBER_1.
   If zero, the default of 8 is used.

   REQ_NAME_ONE at NCB_CALLNAME+3 (1-byte field)
   A request to reserve NAME_NUMBER_1 for this application program.
   If 0, NAME_NUMBER_1 is not requested.
   If not 0, NAME_NUMBER_1 is desired to be reserved for this
   application.

</PRE>Under the Windows NT implementation, the REQ_COMMANDS (NCB_CALLNAME+1)
field is ignored. Instead, an application is bound by the amount of memory
the process can allocate.
<P>
For more information on the differences between the Windows NT
implementation and the IBM NetBIOS 3.0 specifications, see "The NetBIOS
Function" in the "Win32 API Reference" Help file.
