The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Win32s, version 1.3c
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After you install Win32s version 1.30c, every time you start any 32-bit
application that requires Win32s (for example, FREECELL), you get the
following error:
<P>
<PRE>   "One of the System Components is out of date. Please re-install the
   &lt;name of your application&gt;"

</PRE>Note that the above message does not give the name of the system component,
so it is difficult for an end-user to identify the exact problem. This
article discusses the possible reasons for this error message under Win32s.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The following are three known situations where this error message occurs:

<OL><P><LI>You might have a mix of debug and retail Win32s and OLE files in your
   Windows 3.1 system directory as a result of upgrading your previous
   installation of Win32s. The Win32s SETUP.EXE program is designed to run
   only under the retail version of Win32s. If you have switched to the
   debug version of Win32s in the past by using the SWITCH.BAT file in the
   Win32s\Bin directory and then tried to run the Setup program, Win32s
   will not be installed properly on your computer. This is because some of
   the Win32s and OLE files will not be replaced correctly.
<P>
   NOTE: Do not use the SWITCH.BAT program to upgrade your previous
   installation to Win32s.

<P><LI>If this error message appears and your application starts and continues
   to run, then the OLE32.DLL installed on your computer is an older
   version, not the one in Win32s version 1.30c. (Note that the OLE version
   for Win32s 1.30c should be 2.3.130.168.) Microsoft decided to
   incorporate this behavior into Win32s version 1.30c because it wanted
   ISVs to distribute the OLE 2.0 DLLs with 1.30c, even if their
   applications are not OLE 2.0 applications.
<P>
   If the application does not start after displaying this error message,
   it usually means that the application is an OLE 2.0 application, and
   hence it will not start to run even if only OLE32.DLL does not have the
   correct version. This could mean that one or more of the OLE16 DLLs were
   not installed correctly.
<P>
   If you run your application under the debug version of Win32s, you
   should get one of the following messages:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - err: Could not get file version info size for OLE32.DLL.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - err: Can't allocate version buffer (%ld bytes).
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - err: Could not get file version info.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - err: Could not query Fixed File Information.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - err: Wrong OLE32.DLL version: %d.%d.%d.%d.
</PRE><P>
   The last message tells you the version of OLE32.DLL.

<P><LI>This error message appears due to a bug in Win32s 1.30c specific to
   Novell networks. If the Windows system directory is mapped to the root
   directory of any drive on the Novell network, this message will appear
   each time you start a Win32s application. However, the application will
   start.
<P>
</OL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 

<OL><P><LI>If you are running into situation 1 above, it is highly probable that
   you are an ISV or software developer running Win32s. An ISV can remedy
   the problem as follows:
<P>
   - Switch to the retail version of Win32s first by using the SWITCH.BAT
<P><PRE>     file in the Win32s\Bin directory. Then run the Win32s Setup program to
     upgrade to the newer version of Win32s.
</PRE><P>
   This situation should not apply to a Win32s installation on an end-user
   machine. If you are an end-user of Win32s, please see the following two
   options.

<P><LI>If you are running into situation 2 above, you should manually verify
   that all the OLE DLLs on your system are installed correctly. Compare
   the file dates and version numbers of all the OLE files between the
   Win32s directory on your system and the installation disks.

<P><LI>If you are running into the Win32s bug on a Novell network (situation 3
   above), one workaround is to not map the Windows system directory to the
   root directory of any drive. Rather, map it to a sub-directory on the
   drive. For example, if you have mapped the Windows system directory to
   W:\ drive, the workaround is to map the Windows system directory to
   Z:\SYSTEM directory on your Novell network.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If none of the above solutions work for you, you should remove your
previous installation of Win32s as described in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base article below, and then run the Win32s Setup program:
