<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Even though the Unimodem reports that it supports
LINEMEDIAMODE_INTERACTIVEVOICE in LINEDEVCAPS.dwMediaMode, it only
supports INTERACTIVEVOICE for outbound calls. If an application opens a
line for both LINEMEDIAMODE_INTERACTIVEVOICE and LINECALLPRIVILEGE_OWNER,
lineOpen fails with LINEERR_INVALMEDIAMODE.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Unimodem is designed to handle data calls, not voice calls. However, it
does provide the ability to dial the phone for use with normal,
interactive voice phone calls. This is done by supporting the
LINEMEDIAMODE_INTERACTIVEVOICE media mode as indicated in
LINEDEVCAPS.dwMediaMode. However, because Unimodem only supports dialing
INTERACTIVEVOICE and not answering INTERACTIVEVOICE calls, it fails a
lineOpen for LINEMEDIAMODE_INTERACTIVEVOICE that includes
LINECALLPRIVILEGE_OWNER.
<P>
The suggested solution is to first attempt to lineOpen the line for
LINEMEDIAMODE_INTERACTIVEVOICE and LINECALLPRIVILEGE_OWNER. If this fails,
then attempt to open with LINECALLPRIVILEGE_NONE (or MONITOR privileges).
If this succeeds, then the application can make, but not receive
INTERACTIVEVOICE calls and should indicate this capability to the user.
