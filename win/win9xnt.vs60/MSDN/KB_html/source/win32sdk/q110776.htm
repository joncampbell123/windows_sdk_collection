<P>
There is no list that shows specifically which MS-DOS LAN Manager APIs
(application programming interfaces) are supported in a VDM (virtual DOS
machine) on Windows NT. This article discusses what influenced whether or
not an API would be implemented.
<P>
The set of APIs that is supported is relatively small. It was necessary to
implement named pipes, mailslots, NetServerEnum(), and the NetUseXXX APIs.
The APIs that are commonly used in shipping applications were implemented,
if possible. There were certain APIs that were impossible to implement from
the VDM. The remaining APIs were not added either because Microsoft did not
feel that they were used in applications or because they did not make sense
in this context, such as the NetServiceXXX APIs.
