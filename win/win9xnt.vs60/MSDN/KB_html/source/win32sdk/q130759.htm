The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Win32 Application Programming Interface (API) included with:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Microsoft Windows 95 version 4.0
</UL></PRE> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The EM_GETHANDLE and EM_SETHANDLE messages are not supported for edit
contols that are created as controls of a 32-bit application under Windows
95. This is due to the way USER is designed under Windows 95. 16-bit
applications work the same way they did under Windows version 3.1. That is,
they can use the EM_GET/SETHANDLE messages. Also Win32-based applications
running under Windows NT will be able to use these messages.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The EM_GETHANDLE and EM_SETHANDLE messages are used to retrieve and set the
handle of the memory currently allocated for a multiline edit control's
text. USER under Windows 95 is a mixture of 16- and 32-bit code, so edit
controls created inside a 32-bit application cannot use these messages to
retrieve or set the handles. Trying to do so causes the application to
cause a general protection (GP) fault and thereby be terminated by the
System.
<P>
One workaround that involves a little code modification is to use the
GetWindowTextLengt(), GetWindowText(), and SetWindowText() APIs to retrieve
and set the text in a edit control.
<P>
NOTE: USER is almost completely 16-bit, so 32-bit applications thunk down
to the 16-bit USER. Also note that the EM_GETHANDLE and EM_SETHANDLE
messages cannot be used with Win32s-based applications either.
