The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) versions 3.1

<LI>Microsoft Win32 Application Programming Interface (API) included with:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Microsoft Windows NT versions 3.5 and 3.51
    - Microsoft Windows 95 version 4.0
</UL></PRE> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In a standard Microsoft Windows version 3.1 multiple document
interface (MDI) application, when a minimized MDI child is active and
the user presses the ENTER key, the child is not restored.
<P>
This is inconsistent with other MDI applications, such as File Manager
and Program Manager. An MDI child in one of these applications is
restored when it is the active MDI child and the ENTER key is pressed.
When a normal Windows-based application is minimized and the user presses
ENTER, that application is restored to a normal state.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
One quick workaround to this problem is to create an accelerator for
the ENTER key and restore the minimized MDI child when the key is
pressed.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
It may be desirable to implement the same restore feature that File
Manager and Program Manager have implemented in order to enable the
user to restore an MDI child by pressing the ENTER key. If this
feature is implemented, then the MDI application can be consistent
with other popular applications such as File Manager, Microsoft Excel,
and Microsoft Word.
<P>
To achieve this effect in an MDI application, create an accelerator in
the accelerator table of the resource file for the application. This
can be done as follows:
<P>
MdiAccelTable ACCELERATORS
<PRE>     {
     .  .  .
     .  .  .
     VK_RETURN, IDM_RESTORE, VIRTKEY
     }

</PRE>After this accelerator has been installed in the MDI application, each
time the ENTER key is pressed by the user, an IDM_RESTORE command will
be sent to the MDI frame window's window procedure through a
WM_COMMAND message. When the MDI frame receieves this message, its
window procedure should retrieve a handle to the active MDI child and
determine if it is minimized. If it is minimized, then it can restore
the MDI child by sending the MDI client a WM_MDIRESTORE message. This
can all be done with the following code:
<P>
<PRE>        case IDM_RESTORE:
           {
           HWND hwndActive;

           hwndActive = SendMessage(hwndClient,WM_MDIGETACTIVE,0,0L);
           if (IsIconic(hwndActive))
              SendMessage(hwndClient,WM_MDIRESTORE,hwndActive,0L);
           break;
           }
</PRE>
