The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Win32 Application Programming Interface (API) included with:
   - Microsoft Windows NT version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has made available exportable and non-exportable versions of
Service Pack 2 for Windows NT 4.0. The non-exportable or North American
version of Service Pack 2 is available only in the United States and Canada
through mail or phone order.
<P>
IMPORTANT NOTE: Due to a bug with RC2 cipher support in the Enhanced
Cryptographic Service Provider, developers should NOT use this
implementation of RC2. A fix for this bug is scheduled for Windows NT 4.0
Service Pack 3.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Export of this product from the United States is regulated under "EI
controls" of the Export Administration Regulations (EAR, 15 CFR 730-744) of
the U.S. Commerce Department, Bureau of Export Administration (BXA). EI
controls are the current equivalent of ITAR munitions export controls that
applied to this product prior to 1/1/97. EI controls require that you
obtain a Commerce export license prior to any export, transmission, or
shipment of this product to any country, other than Canada, or to any
person, entity, or end user subject to U.S. export restrictions. The
Commerce export license process and EI controls are described on BXA's web
site at <B><A href="http://www.bxa.doc.gov/encstart.htm">http://www.bxa.doc.gov/encstart.htm</A></B>
<P>
This export-controlled product includes the following features that are not
available in the downloadable version of Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 2:
<P>
An Enhanced Cryptographic Service Provider that allows applications that
call CryptoAPI to use stronger keys and new algorithms. Algorithm support
has been extended to include DES and Triple DES. Keylengths have been
extended for RC4 ciphers to 128 bits; RSA keylengths have been lengthened
to allow up to 16K bit keys. In addition to providing additional strengths
and algorithms, the enhanced service provider continues to support the
algorithms and strengths provided by the base provider.
<P>
This Service Pack also includes 128-bit support for Remote Access Server
(RAS). Wide area connections made using RAS on both Windows NT Workstation
and Windows NT Server use a 128-bit key to encrypt data, thus providing a
more secure connection.
<P>
Internet browsers and servers (including Internet Explorer 3.01 and
Internet Information Server 3.0) use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) today for
message integrity and confidentiality of communications, and optionally
mutual authentication. With SSL, parties using the Internet can be
confident that their communication is private and has not been tampered
with or altered. Support for SSL 2.0 and SSL 3.0 shipped with this Service
Pack uses 128-bit encryption.
<P>
Secure RPC has also been enhanced to support 128-bit encryption. Any
application that requests secure RPC will automatically use 128-bit
encryption.
