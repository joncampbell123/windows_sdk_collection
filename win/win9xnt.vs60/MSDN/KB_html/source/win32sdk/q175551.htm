The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Win32 Application Programming Interface (API) included with:
   - Microsoft Windows CE, versions 1.0, 2.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Unlike other Win32 platforms, the Windows CE serial driver is implemented
as overlapped. This means it can handle multiple concurrent I/O requests
even though file handles must be opened as non-overlapped.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
On most Win32 platforms, the I/O manager serializes non-overlapped serial
communications. This implies that if there is an I/O request that is
blocked, any subsequent I/O request will also be blocked until the pending
I/O request completes. This is true even if each request was made from a
separate thread.
<P>
While the Windows CE API does not support overlapped I/O, the serial driver
is implemented as overlapped, that is, it can handle multiple concurrent
I/O requests even though file handles are opened as non-overlapped.
Therefore, serial communications programs on Windows CE devices have the
following implementation option, which will not work on other Win32
platforms. A reading thread may call WaitCommEvent and when a RX_CHAR event
arrives then call ReadFile to read characters from the port. The exact
amount of data to read can be obtained by calling ClearCommError. A
separate thread may simultaneously write to the port without hanging. The
following sample code demonstrates this read technique.

<PRE>   DWORD WINAPI
   ReadThread (LPVOID pvarg)
   {
     DWORD   BytesTransferred;
     DWORD   fdwCommMask;

     COMMTIMEOUTS CommTimeouts;
     DWORD   t;

     GetCommTimeouts (hPort, &amp;CommTimeouts);
     CommTimeouts.ReadIntervalTimeout = MAXDWORD;
     CommTimeouts.ReadTotalTimeoutMultiplier = 0;
     CommTimeouts.ReadTotalTimeoutConstant = 0;  // Read timeout at 50msec
     SetCommTimeouts (hPort, &amp;CommTimeouts);

     SetCommMask (hPort, EV_RXCHAR | EV_CTS | EV_DSR | EV_RLSD | EV_RING);

     while (!v_bStopThread) {
        WaitCommEvent (hPort, &amp;fdwCommMask, 0);

        // Reset the comm Mask
        SetCommMask (hPort, EV_RXCHAR | EV_CTS | EV_DSR | EV_RING);

        if (fdwCommMask &amp; EV_RXCHAR) {
            // Loop getting data.

         // Need to loop because our buffer is only 1024 bytes
                while (TRUE)
                {
                    ClearCommError( hPort,&amp;dwErrors,&amp;Stat);

                                    0
                                    );
                            // do something with data
                    }
                   // Loop around and check for more data
                   // In case additional byte has arrived while reading.
                }
        }
