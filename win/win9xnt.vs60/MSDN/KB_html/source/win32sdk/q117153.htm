<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Applications running on Windows 3.1 exhibit no problems when using an S3
driver, with a resolution of 1024x768 and 256 colors. However, the display
is corrupted when Win32-based applications, such as FreeCell, run on Win32s
in the same configuration.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This is a known problem with the S3 driver.
<P>
A general protection (GP) fault occurs when the display driver is
performing a bit-block transfer (BitBlt). This happens whether or not
Win32s is running. However, when Win32s is not running, Windows recovers
from the faults. When a Win32-based application is running, Win32s catches
all exceptions and transfers control to the nearest try/except frame. As a
result, the BitBlt is interrupted.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Certain S3 drivers which exhibit these problems can be made to work with
Win32s by making the following edit to your SYSTEM.INI file before running
any Win32-based applications:
<P>
In the SYSTEM.INI file, you will find an entry in the [display] section
<P>
<PRE>   aperture-base=100

</PRE>Change this entry to
<P>
<PRE>   aperture-base=0

</PRE>Restart Windows and the display problems will no longer occur.
<P>
If this does not help, obtain the latest S3 drivers. It is reported that S3
driver version 1.3 does not have this problem.
