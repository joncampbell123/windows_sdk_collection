<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Windows supports multiple references to a given resource. For example,
suppose that an application has two top-level menus that each contain the
same submenu. (An application can use the AppendMenu or SetMenu functions
to add a submenu to another menu at run time.)
<P>
Normally, destroying a menu destroys all of its submenus. In the case
above, however, when one menu is destroyed, the other menu has a lock on
the common submenu. Therefore, the common submenu remains in memory and is
not destroyed. The handle to the submenu remains valid until all references
to the submenu are removed. The submenu either remains in memory or is
discarded, while its handle remains valid.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Windows maintains a lock count for each resource, including menus. When the
lock count falls to zero, Windows can free (destroy) the object. Each time
an application loads a resource, its lock count is incremented. If a
resource is loaded more than once, only one copy is created; subsequent
loads only increment the lock count. Each call to free a resource
decrements its lock count.
<P>
When the LoadResource function determines if a resource has already been
loaded, it also determines if the resource has been discarded. If so,
LoadResource loads the resource again. The resource is not necessarily
present in memory at all times. However, if the lock count is not zero and
the resource is discarded, Windows will automatically reload the resource.
All resources are discardable and will be discarded if required to free
memory.
<P>
Therefore, in the example above, the application's call to the DestroyMenu
function calls FreeResource, which checks the lock count. This process is
analogous to LoadMenu, which calls LoadResource.
