<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
While increasing your working set size and locking pages in physical memory
can reduce paging for your application, it can adversely affect the system
performance. When making decisions for your application, it is important to
consider the whole system, and then test your application under a heavily
loaded system, such as the users of your application might have.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Win32 SDK provides a tool called the working set tuner (WST.EXE). The
working set tuner decreases the working set size, which decreases memory
demand. However, you can also choose to set the process working set minimum
and maximum using SetProcessWorkingSetSize() and/or lock pages into memory
with VirtualLock(). These APIs should be used with care. Suppose you have a
16-megabyte system and you set your minimum to four megabytes. In effect,
this takes away four megabytes from the system. Other applications may be
unable to get their minimum working set. You or other applications may be
unable to create processes or threads or perform other operations that
require non-paged pool. This can have an extremely negative impact on the
overall system.
<P>
Reducing memory consumption is always a beneficial goal. If you call
SetProcessWorkingSetSize(0xffffffff, 0xffffffff), this tells the system
that your working set can be released. This does not change the current
sizing of the working set, it just allows the memory to be used by other
applications. It is a good idea to do this when your application goes into
a wait state. When you call SetProcessWorkingSet(0, 0), your working set is
reset to the default values. In addition, if you call VirtualUnlock() on a
range that was not locked, it is used as a hint that those pages can be
removed from the working set.
