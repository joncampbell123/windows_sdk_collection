The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Win32 Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows NT,
   versions 3.51, 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Multithreaded applications compiled for Windows NT on PowerPC processors
may show incorrect or unexpected floating point exception handling
behavior. When two or more threads in a process set their floating point
masks to different values, all of the threads get the same mask value as
the thread that set its mask last.
<P>
When this problem is encountered, the exact behavior of the application
will depend on which floating point exceptions are masked and unmasked and
how the application handles exceptions that do occur. Following is a
possible scenario:

<UL><LI>One thread unmasks a floating point exception and, some time
   after that, another unmasks a different exception. Then, during the
   course of computation the first thread generates an exception
   that it has unmasked but its exception handler does not get
   called. Or, it generates the exception that the second thread
   unmasked and its handler does get called but with an exception
   that it wasn't expecting.
<P>
</UL>This problem occurs only on PowerPC processors; Windows NT on other
processors does not exhibit this problem.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The PowerPC's floating point status and control register (FPSCR) is not
being saved during thread context switches; it is being treated as a per-
process resource rather than a per-thread resource.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows NT
versions 3.51 and 4.0. Microsoft is researching this problem and will post
new information here as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The only time this behavior becomes a problem is when a multithreaded
application uses different floating point exception masks for each thread.
If the application is single-threaded or if all threads use the same
floating point exception mask, the problem does not occur.
<P>
The code below demonstrates the problem. The first thread unmasks floating
point divide by zero exceptions and then spawns another thread and waits
for it to exit. The spawned thread unmasks floating point underflow
exceptions and then exits. When the first thread returns from waiting for
the second, the FPSCR is set to floating point underflow exceptions being
unmasked but floating point divide by zero exceptions being masked. Thus,
the FPSCR value of the first thread's is now set to that of the second
thread. When the first thread performs the computation, the divide by zero
error is not sent to the exception handler.
<P>
<P><h3>Sample Code</h3>
 
<P>
To see the problem in a debugger as it happens, build this sample with
Microsoft Visual C++, and then set breakpoints on the lines with the
"BP x here" comments. As you step through the code, examine the value of
the FPSCR in the registers window of the debugger:
<P>
<PRE>   #include &lt;windows.h&gt;
   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
   #include &lt;float.h&gt;

   DWORD WINAPI Thread (LPVOID lpvParam);

   void main (int argc, char ** argv)
   {
      volatile float x1 = 5.0F,
                     x2 = 0.0F;
      DWORD          tid;
      HANDLE         hThread;

      // Unmask floating point divide by zero exceptions for
      // this thread.
      _controlfp ((unsigned int)~_EM_ZERODIVIDE, _MCW_EM);   // BP 1 here

      // Create another thread
      hThread = CreateThread(NULL, 0, Thread, NULL, 0, &amp;tid);

      // This will force a context switch.
      WaitForSingleObject (hThread, INFINITE);       // BP 2 here
      CloseHandle (hThread);

      // WHEN GET TO HERE, this thread's FPSCR should still
      // have the FP divide by zero exception unmasked.
      __try
      {

         x1 /= x2;   // cause FP divide by zero         // BP 3 here

      }
      __except (GetExceptionCode() == EXCEPTION_FLT_DIVIDE_BY_ZERO ?
                EXCEPTION_EXECUTE_HANDLER :
                EXCEPTION_CONTINUE_SEARCH)
      {
         // BP 4 on next line
         printf ("Trapped floating point divide by zero exception\n");
         _clearfp();
      }
      // BP 5 on next line
      printf ("past floating point divide by zero exception\n");
   }

   // This is a dummy thread that gets the default FPSCR settings
   // when created.
   DWORD WINAPI Thread (LPVOID lpvParam)
   {
      // Unmask floating point underflow exceptions for
      // this thread.
      _controlfp ((unsigned int)~_EM_UNDERFLOW, _MCW_EM);    // BP 6 here
      return 0;
   }

</PRE>When this application works correctly, it should produce this output:
<P>
<PRE>   Trapped floating point divide by zero exception
   past floating point divide by zero exception

</PRE>The incorrect output is:
<P>
<PRE>   past floating point divide by zero exception
</PRE>
