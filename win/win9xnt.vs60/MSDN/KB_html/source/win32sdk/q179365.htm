<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article explains how the Run, RunOnce, RunServices, RunServicesOnce,
and RunOnce\Setup registry keys relate to each other and to the Startup
Folder. It also describes the order in which these keys are loaded.
<P>
The information contained in this article is meant to supplement the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : Definition of the RunOnce Keys in the Registry

</PRE>Please see this article for an explanation of each of these keys.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Under Windows 95, where all keys are supported, the keys are loaded in the
following order:
<P>
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunServicesOnc
e
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunServices
&lt;Logon Prompt&gt;
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
StartUp Folder
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce
<P>
With the exception of the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\...\RunOnce key, all keys and
their entries are loaded asynchronously. Therefore, all entries in the
RunServices and RunServicesOnce keys can potentially run at the same time.
<P>
Entries in the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\...\RunOnce key are loaded synchronously
in the order they were added to the RunOnce key. (This is not necessarily
the order in which these entries are displayed by the Registry Editor.)
<P>
Since the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\...\RunOnce key is loaded synchronously, all
of its entries must finish loading before the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\...\Run,
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\...\Run, HKEY_CURRENT_USER\...\RunOnce, and Startup
Folder entries can be loaded.
<P>
Under Windows 95, the RunServicesOnce and RunServices keys are loaded
before the user logs into Windows 95. Because these two keys run
asynchronously with the Logon dialog box, they can continue to run after
the user has logged on. However, since HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\...\RunOnce must
load synchronously, its entries will not begin loading until after the
RunServicesOnce and RunServices keys have finished loading.
<P>
Because of different system configurations (such as a machine that is
configured to automatically log on), any application that is dependant upon
other applications that are executed under these keys having completed must
be prepared to wait until these applications are complete.
<P>
The RunServices, RunServicesOnce, and Run\Setup keys are not currently
supported by Windows NT and the RunOnce key is not supported by Windows NT
3.51.
