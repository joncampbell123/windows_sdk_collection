<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Using a DEVMODE structure to modify printer settings is more complicated
than simply changing the fields of the structure. Specifically, a valid
DEVMODE structure for a device contains private data that can only be
modified by the DocumentProperties() function. This article discusses the
necessary steps to properly modify the contents of a DEVMODE structure with
the DocumentProperties() function.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
A DEVMODE structure, as documented by the Win32 SDK, contains public or
"Device Independent data" and private or "Device Dependent data." The
private part of a DEVMODE exists immediately following the public part,
which is defined by the DEVMODE structure, in a contiguous buffer of
memory.
<P>
An application cannot predict the size of this buffer because it is
different from printer to printer and version to version of printer driver.
Further, a DEVMODE structure that is simply declared by an application does
not contain sufficient space for private device data. If a DEVMODE buffer
that lacks private data is passed to functions such as CreateDC(),
ResetDC(), and DocumentProperties(), the function may fail.
<P>
To reliably use a DEVMODE with a device driver it should be properly
created and modified using the following procedure:

<OL><P><LI>Determine the required size of the buffer from the device and allocate
   sufficient memory for it.
<P>
   The DocumentProperties() function returns the number of bytes required
   for a DEVMODE buffer when the last parameter is set to 0. The sample
   code in this article (see below) uses this technique to determine
   the correct size of the buffer. Then it uses the C run-time memory
   allocation function of malloc() to allocate a buffer of sufficient
   size. Since DocumentProperties() and functions like ResetDC() and
   CreateDC() take pointers to a DEVMODE as a parameter, it is sufficient
   for most applications to allocate memory that is addressed by a
   pointer.
<P>
   However, functions such as the common dialog PrintDlg() take parameters
   that are required to be handles to global memory. If an application
   uses the final DEVMODE buffer as a parameter to one of these functions,
   it should allocate memory using the GlobalAlloc() function and obtain a
   pointer to the buffer using the GlobalLock() function.

<P><LI>Ask the device driver to initialize the DEVMODE buffer with the default
   settings.
<P>
   The sample code calls DocumentProperties() a second time to initialize
   the allocated buffer with the current default settings.
   DocumentProperties() fills the buffer referred to as the pDevModeOutput
   parameter with the printer's current settings when the DM_OUT_BUFFER
   command is passed in the fMode parameter.
<P>

<P><LI>Make changes to the public portion of the DEVMODE and ask the device
   driver to merge the changes into the private portion of the DEVMODE
   by calling the DocumentProperties() function.
<P>
   After initializing the buffer with current settings in step 2, the
   sample code makes changes to the public part of the DEVMODE. Refer to
   the Win32 SDK documentation for descriptions of the DEVMODE members.
   This sample code checks to see if the printer can use orientation and
   duplex(double sided) settings and changes them appropriately.
<P>
   Note that a flag in a DEVMODE's dmFields member is only an indication
   that a printer uses the associated structure member. Printers have a
   variety of different physical characteristics and, therefore, may only
   support a subset of a DEVMODE's documented capabilities. To determine
   the supported settings of a DEVMODE's field, applications should use
   the DeviceCapabilities() function.
<P>
   Then the sample code makes a third call to DocumentProperties() and
   passes the DEVMODE buffer in both the pDevModeInput and pDevModeOutput
   parameters. It also passes the combined commands of DM_IN_BUFFER and
   DM_OUT_BUFFER in the fMode parameter by using the OR("|") operator.
   These commands tell the function to take whatever settings are contained
   in the input buffer and merge them with the current settings for
   the device. Then it writes the result to the buffer specified in the
   out parameter.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: The DocumentProperties() function refers to a specific printer by a
handle to a printer: hPrinter. This handle is obtained from the
OpenPrinter() function, which the sample code also illustrates. The
OpenPrinter() function requires the name of a printer that is usually the
friendly name of the printer as it appears in the Operating System's shell.
This name can be obtained from the EnumPrinters() function, from the
DEVNAMES structure returned by the PrintDlg() function, or from the Default
Printer. For additional information about the Default Printer, please see
the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

</PRE></OL>NOTE: In this article the first two steps of allocating the correct size of
buffer and initializing that buffer are performed with the
DocumentProperties() function. The GetPrinter() function can also be used
to perform these steps. For an example of this use, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : HOWTO: Modify Printer Settings by Using SetPrinter

</PRE><h3>Sample Code</h3>
 
<P>
The sample function included in this article follows these three steps for
obtaining and changing the DEVMODE buffer. The function takes a named
printer and configures a DEVMODE to print landscape and double sided if it
supports these features. The resulting DEVMODE that is returned to the
caller is suitable for other API calls that use DEVMODE buffers such a
CreateDC(), SetPrinter(), PrintDlg(), or ResetDC(). When the caller is done
with the DEVMODE buffer it is responsible for freeing the memory.
