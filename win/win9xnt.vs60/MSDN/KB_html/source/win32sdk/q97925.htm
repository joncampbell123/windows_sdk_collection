<P>
By default, each thread has an independent input state (its own active
window, its own focus window, and so forth). SetActiveWindow() always
logically sets a thread's active window state. To force a window to the
foreground, however, use SetForegroundWindow(). SetForegroundWindow()
activates a window and forces the window into the foreground.
SetActiveWindow() always activates, but it brings the active window into
the foreground only if the thread is the foreground thread.
<P>
NOTE: If the target window was not created by the calling thread, the
active window status of the calling thread is set to NULL, and the active
window status of the thread that created the target window is set to the
target window.
<P>
Applications can call AttachThreadInput() to allow a set of threads to
share the same input state. By sharing input state, the threads share their
concept of the active window. By doing this, one thread can always activate
another thread's window. This function is also useful for sharing focus
state, mouse capture state, keyboard state, and window Z-order state among
windows created by different threads whose input state is shared.
