<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Notepad, Cardfile, and Calendar do not automatically highlight the default
printer, which was set up from the Control Panel, as the default printer
selection when you select Printer Setup from the File menu. The first
printer in the list of printers is selected, rather than the printer most
recently set as the default printer. From Notepad, Cardfile, and Calendar,
if no printer is selected under Printer Setup, these applications print to
the default printer listed as the Default Printer in the Control Panel.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Once a printer has been selected under Printer Setup from the File
menu, it remains the active printer until another one is chosen or the
work session ends. When you go back into the Printer Setup menu, you
see that the first printer on the list is selected again.
<P>
Notepad, Cardfile, and Calendar list all printer devices listed in the
WIN.INI file. As a result, you can select a printer from Printer Setup
that is not connected to a port or is marked as inactive. Attempting
to print to a printer that is not connected or is marked as inactive
results in the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Cannot print (filename);
   ensure the printer is connected and properly set up

</PRE>Select a printer that is connected to a port and is marked active.
<P>
When choosing Printer Setup from the File menu, the printer that
remains selected is the printer that was added last through the
Control Panel or Setup. The order of the printers in Notepad's Printer
Setup is opposite to the order listed in the WIN.INI file under
[Printer Ports] (the last printer added is first on the list).
<P>
Windows applications such as Word for Windows, Excel, or Terminal
select and change the Windows default printer with Printer Setup.
<P>
Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information
here as it becomes available.
