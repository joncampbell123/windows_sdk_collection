</PRE><h3>Epson ActionLaser Printers (EPLZR.EXE)</h3>
 
<P>
10/08/92 - This file has been updated with version 3.1.2 of the
<PRE>           Universal Printer Driver (UNIDRV.DLL). In this UNIDRV.DLL
           update, support was added for the HP LaserJet III family of
           printers.

</PRE>07/10/92 - UNIDRV.DLL was updated to version 3.1.1. See UNIDRV.EXE
<PRE>           changes for specific details.

</PRE>04/06/92 - The driver for the Espon EPL-7000 does not address any
<PRE>           particular problems in the driver shipped with Windows 3.1
           that supports this printer. The WDL version of this driver
           is considered to be more robust. It is recommended that
           customers using this printer use the WDL version of the
           driver.

</PRE><h3>Epson ESC/P 2 Scalable Font Driver (ESCP2.EXE)</h3>
 
<P>
06/24/93 - All the drivers included in this file are now included in
<PRE>           EPSON.EXE. Therefore, this driver has been removed from
           the WDL. Please refer to EPSON.EXE for more information.

</PRE>01/15/93 - This version (1.3) of the Microsoft Windows printer
<PRE>           driver for ESC/P 2 printers is an update to the one previously
           provided in the WDL (ESCP2.DRV). The ESCP2.DRV and the
           ESCP2E.DRV drivers support different features on the printer.
           The ESCP2.DRV driver takes advantage of the printer's raster
           data-compression modes but doesn't support device fonts.
           This means that TrueType fonts and graphics print faster
           than with other Epson drivers. The ESCP2E.DRV driver supports
           scalable device fonts, as well as TrueType fonts and raster
           graphics. However, TrueType fonts and raster graphics data
           do not print as quickly as when using ESCP2.DRV.

           This file also has been combined with EPLQ.EXE and now
           contains the drivers that were in the EPLQ.EXE file.

           Support for the following models has been added:

              Epson AP-3250 Scalable Font
              Epson AP-5500 Scalable Font
              Epson AP-5000 Scalable Font
              Epson LP-100  Scalable Font
              Epson SQ-870  Scalable Font
              Epson SQ-1170 Scalable Font
              Epson LQ-570  Scalable Font

              Epson LQ-1070 Scalable Font
              Epson LQ-1170 Scalable Font

           NOTE: AP stands for Action Printer.

           The scalable device font names were changed as follows:

              Roman PS to Roman Scalable
              San Serif PS to San Serif Scalable

           A problem with using the printer's tear-off feature was
           corrected.

           Version 1.3 of the Microsoft Windows printer driver for
           Epson ESC/P 2 24-pin printers is an update to the one
           provided in the Windows 3.1 package (version 1.0).

           Resolution 360x180 was not listed on the LQ-870 and LQ-1070
           printer drivers. This version adds this resolution to
           all printer models. The resolutions are 180x180, 360x180, and
           360x360 dots per inch.

           The orientation of envelope paper sizes are incorrect on
           version 1.1 and was based on raster printer paper feeding.
           Version 1.3 allows printing on envelopes in the correct
           orientation for dot-matrix printers.

           The printable area of some paper sizes are modified to
           prevent occasional incorrect and inconsistent paper feeding
           problems when using the sheet feeder.

</PRE>11/16/92 - This version (1.25) of the Microsoft Windows printer
<PRE>           driver for Epson ESC/P 2 printers is an update to the
           one previously provided in the WDL (ESCP2.DRV). The
           difference between the ESCP2.DRV and the ESCP2E.DRV drivers
           is in the features they support on the printer. The
           ESCP2.DRV driver takes advantage of the printer's raster
           data-compression modes, but doesn't support device fonts.
           This means that TrueType fonts and graphics print
           faster with this driver than with other Epson drivers. The
           ESCP2E.DRV driver supports scalable device fonts, as well
           as TrueType fonts and raster graphics. However, TrueType
           fonts and raster graphics data do not print as quickly as
           when using ESCP2.DRV.

           ESCP2E.DRV corrects the following problems:

            - Support for the following models has been added:

                 Epson AP-3250 Scalable Font
                 Epson AP-5500 Scalable Font
                 Epson AP-5000 Scalable Font
                 Epson LQ-100  Scalable Font
                 Epson SQ-870  Scalable Font
                 Epson SQ-1170 Scalable Font

              NOTE: AP stands for Action Printer.

            - The scalable device font names were changed from:

                 Roman PS to Roman Scalable
                 San Serif PS to San Serif Scalable

            - A problem when using the printer's tear-off feature has
              been corrected.

</PRE>10/08/92 - This file has been updated with version 3.1.2 of the
<PRE>           Universal Printer Driver (UNIDRV.DLL). In this UNIDRV.DLL
           update, support was added for the HP LaserJet III family of
           printers.

</PRE>09/08/92 - This version (1.3) of the Microsoft Windows printer
<PRE>           driver for Epson ESC/P 2 24-pin printers is an update to
           the one provided in the Windows 3.1 package (version 1.0).

           It corrects the following problems:

            - Several Epson ESC/P 2 printer models are added: LQ-100,
              AP-3250, AP-5000, AP-5500, SQ-870, and SQ-1170. (The
              model names beginning with "AP" are abbreviations for
              Action Printer.)

            - The 360x180 resolution was not listed on the LQ-870
              and LQ-1070 printer drivers. This version adds this
              resolution to all printer models. The resolutions are
              180x180, 360x180, and 360x360 dots per inch (dpi).

            - The orientation of envelope paper sizes was incorrect in
              the version 1.1 driver and was based on laser printer
              paper feeding. Version 1.3 allows printing on envelopes
              in the correct orientation for dot-matrix printers.

            - The printable area of some paper sizes was modified to
              prevent occasional incorrect or inconsistent paper-
              feeding problems when using a sheet feeder.
