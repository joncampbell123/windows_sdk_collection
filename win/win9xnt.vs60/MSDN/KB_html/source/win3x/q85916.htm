The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.1, 3.11
<LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Windows and Windows for Workgroups support the use of the
universal naming convention (UNC) for entries in the [ports] section of the
WIN.INI file.
<P>
Because Windows supports the UNC, you can take advantage of UNC
redirection, which means that you can use a network resource without
formally connecting to it by means of a NET USE command or through use of a
program to access network resources, such as File Manager or the Control
Panel Printers icon.
<P>
UNC redirection is supported by Microsoft LAN Manager versions 1.1 and
later and by 100-percent LAN Manager compatible networks.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Standard printer connections using UNCs give you easier access to network
printers, allowing you to choose from a list of printers, rather than
browse the network or have a handwritten list.
<P>
<P><h3>Using UNC in the WIN.INI [ports] Section</h3>
 
<P>
This example uses a server called ACCOUNT1, and a printer share called
HPIIID. The UNC name in this case is \\ACCOUNT1\HPIIID.
<P>
To print to a network printer without formally connecting to it, do
the following:

<OL><P><LI>Open the WIN.INI file in an ASCII text editor (such as Windows Notepad).

<P><LI>Add the line \\ACCOUNT1\HPIIID= to the [ports] section as follows:
<P>
<P><PRE>      [ports]
      LPT1:=
      LPT2:=
      \\ACCOUNT1\HPIIID=
      ...
</PRE>
<P><LI>Run Control Panel.

<P><LI>Choose the Printers icon and choose the Connect button.

<P><LI>Select the new port called \\ACCOUNT\HPIIID.
<P>
</OL>When you print to this printer, the output is redirected to the network
printer defined by the UNC entry in the [ports] section.
<P>
NOTE: When this port is selected in the Printers Connect dialog box in
Control Panel, the Network button is dimmed (unavailable). When a standard
LPT port is selected, the Network button is available again.
<P>
Some applications may not be able to understand UNC redirection.
