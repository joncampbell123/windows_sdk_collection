The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
SMARTDrive (SMARTDRV.EXE) version 4.0, which comes with Microsoft
Windows operating system version 3.1, is compatible with third-party
disk partitioning and compression software such as Disk Manager,
SpeedStor, SuperStor, and Stacker.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>SMARTDrive VERSION 4.0 COMPATIBILITY</h3>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Stacker</h3>
 
<P>
SMARTDrive has built-in detection for STAC Electronics' Stacker
version 2.0. As a result, SMARTDrive does not cache a stacked drive
and receives the following message:
<P>
<PRE>   Unable to use a disk cache on the specified drive

</PRE>SMARTDrive does not detect Stacker versions 1.x, and these "stacked"
drives can be cached. It is NOT recommended to cache a stacked drive.
<P>
SMARTDrive may be confused when a drive is swapped with the Stacker
SSWAP command. Microsoft recommends loading SMARTDrive in the
AUTOEXEC.BAT after all Stacker operations (such as SSWAP) have been
performed.
<P>
<P><h3>SuperStor</h3>
 
<P>
SMARTDrive must be loaded after all SuperStor software. SMARTDrive
must be specifically told NOT to cache SuperStor drives unless version
2.04 or later of the SuperStor driver is being used.
<P>
You can specifically disable caching on all SuperStor drives, as
follows
<P>
<PRE>   c:\windows\smartdrv.exe d- e-

</PRE>where drives D and E are SuperStor drives.
<P>
SMARTDrive is not compatible with SuperStor's Create Mountable Drive,
Mount, and Dismount commands. Do not use these commands if SMARTDrive
is loaded.
<P>
Caching a SuperStor-compressed drive with SMARTDrive 4.0 results in
read-write errors from the SuperStor drive if the SuperStor driver is
earlier that version 2.04.
<P>
SuperStor 1.3 is not compatible with SMARTDrive version 4.0. SuperStor
version 2.0 should work with SMARTDrive; however, it is advisable to
disable caching for the SuperStor partitions.
<P>
According to SuperStor, using version 2.04 with SMARTDrive 4.0 results
in the correct drives being cached (that is, the uncompressed drive
will be cached and the compressed drive will be not cached).
<P>
Note: The information about SuperStor version 2.x has been provided by
SuperStor, and has not been tested or confirmed by Microsoft.
<P>
<P><h3>SpeedStor</h3>
 
<P>
If SMARTDrive produces errors reading or writing to a Storage
Dimensions' SpeedStor drive, then modify the SSTOR.SYS line in the
CONFIG.SYS file:
<P>
<PRE>   DEVICE=C:\SSTOR.SYS /VIRTUAL

</PRE>SSTOR.SYS must be at least version 6.4 to be used with SMARTDrive. An
upgrade to this version is available from Storage Dimensions.
<P>
<P><h3>Disk Manager (DMDRVR.BIN)</h3>
 
<P>
DMDRVR.BIN must be the first line in the CONFIG.SYS file (before
HIMEM.SYS or other memory managers). If DMDRVR.SYS is located in the
CONFIG.SYS file instead of DMDRVR.BIN, then it will be necessary to
upgrade. The upgrade is available from either ONTRACK Computer Systems
or on the retail MS-DOS 5.0 Upgrade.
