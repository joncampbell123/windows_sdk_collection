The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
To change the font selection or use a mouse with MS-DOS applications
that are running in a window under Microsoft Windows, the following
items are required:

<UL><LI>The MS-DOS application must support the mouse. It must be able
   to use a mouse when running full-screen or outside Windows.

<LI>The MS-DOS mouse driver must support using a mouse in a window,
   which is a new Windows 3.1 feature. The Microsoft Mouse
   version 8.2 (MOUSE.COM) and Logitech version 6.02 (LMOUSE.COM)
   mouse drivers included with Windows 3.1 include support for
   using a mouse in a window. If you have another type of mouse,
   contact the mouse manufacturer for an updated driver.

<LI>The MS-DOS mouse driver must be loaded before Windows is
   started. For example, the driver can be loaded from the
   AUTOEXEC.BAT or CONFIG.SYS file.

<LI>The Windows display driver (specifically, the enhanced mode
   grabber, or 3GR file) must support these features.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
All video drivers that come with Windows 3.1 support mouse usage and
font selection in a window, including EGA, VGA, super VGA, 8514/a,
XGA, TIGA, and Video Seven drivers.
<P>
In addition, all video drivers in the Windows Driver Library (WDL)
support mouse usage and font selection in a window, including adapters
that use the following driver types: Tseng ET4000, S3, DGIS, Appian
RGDI, ATI Ultra, and many others.
<P>
If a Windows 3.0 display driver is being used and it does not support
these features, obtain updated drivers from the Microsoft WDL or your
video manufacturer. In the meantime, you may be able to obtain limited
feature support by using the following switches in the [NonWindowsApp]
section of your SYSTEM.INI file:
<P>
<PRE>   MouseInDosBox=1
   FontChangeEnable=1

</PRE><h2>REFERENCES</h2>
 
<P>
For more information about these switches, see the SYSINI.WRI file in
the WINDOWS directory.
<P>
For more information about using MS-DOS applications with Windows 3.1,
see the "Troubleshooting Guide" in the "Getting Started with Microsoft
Windows" manual.
