<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Some hardware may have problems with the Virtual Parallel Device (VPD) used
by Windows for Workgroups 3.11. Symptoms include garbled printing, hanging
print queues, and the inability to use fax drivers or parallel sound
devices.
<P>
Microsoft has received reports of printing problems on Gateway 2000
computers and reports of problems on parallel devices with software that
requires direct access to the parallel ports, such as Logitech Soundman and
Hewlett-Packard (HP) LaserJet Fax.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Method 1:
<P>
If you do not use your LPT: port for local printing, you can disable
device-contention checking by removing the following line from your Windows
SYSTEM.INI file:
<P>
<PRE>   DEVICE=*VPD

</PRE>Disabling VPD does not affect the ability of Windows for Workgroups to
print over the network. However, if you are printing locally from an
MS-DOS-based application at the same time as Windows is trying to access
the parallel port, no warning appears and printouts may have garbled
characters, or you may experience network communication problems.
<P>
Method 2:
<P>
In Control Panel, choose the 386 Enhanced Mode icon. To turn off VPD
trapping for that port, choose the Never Warn option for the port in
question.
