The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Your computer may stop responding (hang) after you remove your IBM
Token Ring adapter if you have installed Novell NetWare as a secondary
network in Windows for Workgroups. When you start your computer, the
AUTOEXEC.BAT file processes successfully until it reaches the NET
START command. It displays the following message:
<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft NetBind version 2.1

</PRE>Your computer then hangs. To start your computer and gain access to
your hard drive, you must use a bootable floppy.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To correct the problem, remove the network device driver statements
from the CONFIG.SYS file.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If you are not using an IBM Token Ring adapter or have not installed
Novell NetWare as your secondary network, you may receive errors after
removing your network adapter. During CONFIG.SYS processing, the
following displays:
<P>
<PRE>   MAC0006: Network interface hardware not found or not responding.

   MAC0001: Init failure
   Press any key to continue...

</PRE>Once you press a key and the AUTOEXEC.BAT file begins processing, the
following is displayed:
<P>
<PRE>   Error 5733: The protocol manager has reported an incomplete
   binding.

</PRE>Although these errors do not prevent you from using your computer,
they may be signs of an unstable configuration. Microsoft recommends
that you remove the network device drivers from CONFIG.SYS and
AUTOEXEC.BAT until your network adapter is back in your computer.
