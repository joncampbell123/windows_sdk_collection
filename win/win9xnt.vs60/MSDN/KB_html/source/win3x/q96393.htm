The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
The following article contains information on the use of Windows for
Workgroups with third-party products or configurations that have not
been tested and are not supported by Microsoft.
<P>
If the steps or procedures described in this article do not function
properly, contact the manufacturer of the third-party product for more
information or use a supported configuration.
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you use the TCP/IP protocol stack from FTP Software in 386 enhanced
mode of Windows or Windows for Workgroups, the drive letter icons in
File Manager may be unavailable.
<P>
This problem does not occur with the Windows for Workgroups real-mode
redirector.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
FTP Software has confirmed this to be a problem with its current
driver and provides an updated driver to correct this problem. (FTP
Software provides drivers that allow Windows for Workgroups systems to
communicate over the TCP/IP protocol stack.)
<P>
The updated file (WFWFTP.386) is dated 12/23/93 and has a file size of
9344 bytes. It should be copied into the \WINDOWS\SYSTEM subdirectory
and then referenced in the [386Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file as
follows:
<P>
<PRE>   device=WFWFTP.386

</PRE>NOTE: If you already have FTP's TCP/IP installed, you should only need
to copy the updated driver to the \WINDOWS\SYSTEM subdirectory. The
device= line should already be in the SYSTEM.INI file.
<P>
For more information, contact FTP software.
