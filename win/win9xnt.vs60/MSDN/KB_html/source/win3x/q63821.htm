<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you start version 5.0 of Microsoft Word for MS-DOS in a Microsoft
Windows version 3.00 window, you may get the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   You cannot run this application while other high-resolution
   applications are running fullscreen. The application will be
   suspended until a low-resolution or text application is running
   fullscreen. Check the PIF settings to ensure they are correct.

</PRE>Once you have received this error message, you find that you cannot close
your Word window in any of the usual ways. Pressing ALT+Q has no effect,
and the Close option under the Hyphen (-) menu is grayed out.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
If you have tried to start Word in a window and have received this
error message, you probably exited Word when you were in a mode other
than 25-line text mode.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To close the window, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>From the Hyphen menu, Select "Settings...".

<P><LI>Click Full Screen.

<P><LI>Once the application has switched to fullscreen, you may use ALT+Q
   to exit.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If Word is started in a fullscreen and then reduced to a window, you do not
receive the error message; however, you are unable to edit or access the
Word menu. Microsoft Word version 5.0 can only run in a window when it is
in 25-line text mode. You receive the above error message when you start
Word 5.0 in a window and it is in graphics mode (or in 43- or 50-line text
mode). If you start Word in a fullscreen, then reduce it to a window in any
mode other than 25-line text mode, you experience symptoms such as a frozen
double mouse cursor and an inability to call up the Word menu.
<P>
NOTE: Print preView is a graphics screen. This is true regardless of the
display mode in which you are running Word. As a result, Word stops
responding (hangs, or locks up) and gives you the above error message if
you attempt to use Print preView while running the application in a window.
<P>
<P><h3>Solution</h3>
 
<P>
Press ESC, ALT+ENTER to exit to a workable fullscreen display.
