<OL><P><LI>Above Board 286 and Above Board Plus Installation
<P><PRE>    Programs
</OL></PRE> 
<P>
CAUTION: The Intel Above Board installation program that
<PRE>         shipped before May 1989 tests extended memory in a
         way that can corrupt extended memory.

</PRE></OL>Before using an Above Board installation program prior to
May 1989, make sure you haven't loaded software such as
SMARTDrive or RAMDrive that uses extended memory.  After the
Above Board has been installed, other software using
extended memory is unaffected.

<OL><P><LI>AutoCAD
</OL> 
To run AutoCAD release 10 and 11 (AutoCad 386) with MS-DOS,
contact Autodesk.

<OL><P><LI>AUTORUN.EXE
</OL> 
If you can't use Mountain Network Solutions AUTORUN.EXE, a
tape-drive backup program, contact your vendor for an
upgrade.

<OL><P><LI>CodeView
</OL> 
CAUTION: Using versions 3.0 to 3.13 of the CodeView CV.EXE
file may cause data loss if your system has a 80386 memory
manager (such as EMM386.EXE) and device drivers or programs
that use extended memory. To determine which version you
have, type CV.EXE at the command prompt.
<P>
To start CodeView versions 3.0 to 3.13 safely, use the
CV.COM file included with MS-DOS 5.0, and HIMEM.SYS version
2.77 or later.
<P>
To use the CV.COM file included with MS-DOS 5.0, copy it
from the Setup disks to the directory that contains your
CV.EXE file.
<P>
This problem has been fixed in CodeView version 3.14. Call
Microsoft C Support to get this version.

<OL><P><LI>Easel 6.0
</OL> 
Interactive Images Easel 6.0 is incompatible with the
DOS=HIGH and EMM386 commands. Contact your vendor for an
update.

<OL><P><LI>Fastback
</OL> 
If you have a version of Fifth Generation Systems Fastback
earlier than 3.0, you must use the LOADFIX command before
running Fastback or the Fastback installation program. Type
the following:
<P>
LOADFIX FB.EXE
<P>
or
<P>
LOADFIX FBINSTAL.EXE
<P>
For information about the LOADFIX command, see the section
"You receive the 'Packed file corrupt' message"
in the "System Messages" section of Chapter 6, "Troubleshooting
MS-DOS," in "Getting Started."

<OL><P><LI>GeoWorks
</OL> 
If you have a version of GeoWorks (PC/GEOS) earlier than
1.2, use the SETVER command to report version number 4.01 to
the GEOS.EXE file. Type the following:
<P>
SETVER GEOS.EXE 4.01
<P>
Do not run the installation program for GeoWorks Ensemble
when MS-DOS Shell Task Swapper is active.
<P>
Use the Exclusive Tasking option when running GeoWorks
Ensemble with Windows.

<OL><P><LI>Lotus 1-2-3 version 3.0
</OL> 
For information about Lotus 1-2-3 version 3.0, see the
section "Lotus 1-2-3 version 3.0 or 3.1 won't start" in the
"Programs" section of Chapter 6, "Troubleshooting MS-DOS,"
in "Getting Started."

<OL><P><LI>Manifest
</OL> 
Versions 1.01 and later of Quarterdeck Manifest are
compatible with MS-DOS 5.0. If you have a version earlier
than 1.01, contact your vendor for an upgrade.

<OL><P><LI>Paintbrush 2.0
</OL> 
If you have an EGA monitor and want to run Microsoft or
ZSoft Paintbrush 2.0, you must remove the DEVICE=EGA.SYS
command from your CONFIG.SYS file. After removing the
command, you may have difficulty with screen swapping when
using Task Swapper in MS-DOS Shell.

<OL><P><LI>Paradox 3.5
</OL> 
For information about Paradox version 3.5, see the section
"Lotus 1-2-3 version 3.0 or 3.1 won't start" in Chapter 6,
"Troubleshooting MS-DOS," in "Getting Started." This information
also applies to Paradox 3.5.

<OL><P><LI>PC-Kwik Disk Accelerator
</OL> 
Do not load versions of Multisoft PC-Kwik Disk Accelerator
earlier than 2.0 into the upper memory area.

<OL><P><LI>PeachTree Complete III Single-User Version
</OL> 
If you are using the single-user version of PeachTree
Complete III (batch 01 through batch 13), contact PeachTree
for an update.
<P>
There is no compatibility problem with the network version.

<OL><P><LI>Pklite
</OL> 
Do not use Pklite to pack device drivers.
<P>
If you have a PC-Kwik cache on your system, and you can't
run a packed program, do one of the following:
<PRE>   * Use the LOADFIX command to start the program.
   * Run MS-DOS 5.0 in conventional memory.
   * Run a version of the program that was not packed with
     Pklite.
   * Disable asynchronous reads on the PC-Kwik cache.

</PRE></OL>For information about the LOADFIX command, see the section
"You receive the 'Packed file corrupt' message" in the
"System Messages" section of Chapter 6, "Troubleshooting
MS-DOS," in "Getting Started."

<OL><P><LI>ProKey Plus
</OL> 
If you have problems using a version of RoseSoft ProKey Plus
earlier than 5.0, contact your vendor for an upgrade.
<P>
ProKey Plus is incompatible with MS-DOS Editor and QBasic.

<OL><P><LI>Sidekick 2.0
</OL> 
If you are running MS-DOS 5.0 in the high memory area, use
the following LOADFIX command to start Borland Sidekick 2.0:
<P>
<PRE>    LOADFIX sk2.exe

</PRE></OL>For information about the LOADFIX command, see the section
"You receive the 'Packed file corrupt' message" in the
"System Messages" section of Chapter 6, "Troubleshooting
MS-DOS," in "Getting Started."

<OL><P><LI>Soft-ICE
</OL>

</OL> 
Some programs that perform asynchronous communications are
incompatible with MS-DOS Shell Task Swapper. Terminal-
emulation software (such as SmartCom and Procomm Plus) and
server/client software (such as Laplink and Blast) are
asynchronous communications programs. If you can't use an
asynchronous program with Task Swapper, contact your vendor
for more information, or disable Task Swapper.

<OL><P><LI>Ventura Publisher
</OL> 
If you can't start Ventura Publisher, make sure your Ventura
Publisher directory is within the first 70 characters of the
PATH command in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

<OL><P><LI>WordPerfect WPINFO.EXE 5.1
</OL> 
Some versions of the WPINFO.EXE file included with
