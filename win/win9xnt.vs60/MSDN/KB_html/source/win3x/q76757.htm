<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article discusses the 11-Voice FM Music (AdLib compatible)
feature of the Sound Blaster card hardware and how it works with
Microsoft Windows with Multimedia Extensions version 1.0 or with
Windows version 3.1.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
FM stands for frequency modulation, which is how the sound is
produced. The Sound Blaster has 11 FM voices (11 notes polyphony), and
unlike FM-stereo radio, the sound is mono only. FM-synthesis produces
slightly better sounds than square wave synthesis, which is what the
C/MS (creative music synthesizer) chip set does.
<P>
Digital FM synthesis is used by AdLib, Creative Labs, and most other
audio adapter card producers. The Sound Blaster's FM synthesizer is
AdLib compatible. Both Adlib and Creative Labs (the manufacturer of
Sound Blaster) use the FM chip set produced by Yamaha. The AdLib
driver in Windows with Multimedia Extensions will work with any
AdLib-compatible synthesizer, including the Sound Blaster.
<P>
The products included here (other than Windows and Windows with
Multimedia Extensions) are manufactured by vendors independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these
products' performance or reliability.
