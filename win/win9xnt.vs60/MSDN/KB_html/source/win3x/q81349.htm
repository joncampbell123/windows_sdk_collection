The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
WordPerfect version 5.1 may cause erratic floppy drive performance or
violated system integrity errors when running under Microsoft Windows.
Floppy drive problems can be caused by the following features:

<UL><LI>WordPerfect's cursor speed enhancement feature

<LI>Saving a file using WordPerfect's F10 function key
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>WordPerfect's Cursor Speed Enhancement Feature</h3>
 
<P>
WordPerfect testing has confirmed that the cursor speed enhancement
feature included with WordPerfect version 5.1 can be linked to floppy
drive problems. This feature adjusts the system clock timer, which
also seems to affect floppy drive performance. It is suggested that
you use the /NC switch to disable this feature for troubleshooting
these problems in enhanced mode.
<P>
<P><h3>Saving a File Using WordPerfect's F10 Function Key</h3>
 
<P>
You may have difficulty saving a file to the floppy drive if you use
the F10 (save) key in WordPerfect version 5.1 when you are in
Microsoft Windows version 3.0 enhanced mode. You may receive an error
message stating that WordPerfect version 5.1 cannot read the drive.
<P>
<P><h3>Possible Workarounds</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Exit Windows and restart Windows, then return to WordPerfect.

<P><LI>Open the CONFIG.SYS file in WordPerfect. Make sure HIMEM.SYS is
   loaded prior to any other device drivers in the CONFIG.SYS file, as
   in the following example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      DEVICE=C:\HIMEM.SYS
      FILES=30
      BUFFERS=30
      DEVICE=C:\DRIVERNAME
</PRE>
<P><LI>Add the following lines to the [386ENH] section of the SYSTEM.INI:
<P>
<P><PRE>      HighFloppyReads=NO
      EMMExclude=E000-EFFF
</PRE><P>
   This workaround appears to correct a conflict between the way
   WordPerfect 5.1 makes floppy drive calls and some system's shadow
   RAM addressing.

<P><LI>Save your changes and exit by pressing the F7 key in WordPerfect.
   You can still designate the desired drive with the F7 key. (Verify
   that the disk has been formatted and is readable at the MS-DOS
   prompt.)
<P>
</OL>NOTE: Another way to save in WordPerfect is to block the document by
pressing ALT+F4 and then pressing F10 to save the "block name" to the
floppy disk.
