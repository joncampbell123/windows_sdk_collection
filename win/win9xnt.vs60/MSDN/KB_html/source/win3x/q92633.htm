<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If you save a new file from a Windows-based application to a Novell
NetWare server, you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   This file is on a network drive with create but no modify
   privileges; ask the administrator of this network to change this
   condition.

</PRE>In addition to the error message, a 0 byte file is created on the
network drive.
<P>
This error occurs when you have read, write, create, modify, and file
privileges, but not delete privileges, and when the Windows-based
application is using common dialog boxes (COMMDLG.DLL).
<P>
To correct this problem, have the system administrator give you delete
privileges for the server or directory you are trying to use.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you save a new file from an application that uses common dialog boxes,
a test file is created by COMMDLG.DLL to see if the work file can be
created. If the test file is created successfully, it is deleted so that
the application can save the work file. If the attempt to delete the file
fails because you don't have delete privileges, the above error message is
displayed.
