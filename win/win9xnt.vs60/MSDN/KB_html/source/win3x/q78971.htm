               Questions and Answers: Printing in Windows 3.0
               ----------------------------------------------

1. Q. I want to install my printer but it is not on the list of
      printers in the Windows Control Panel. How do I use my printer
      in Windows?

   A. Your printer will work best in Windows if there is a printer
      driver written for it. If your printer is not supported by the
      original Windows disks, you may still be able to get a Windows
      3.0 printer driver for it.

      Many printer companies have arranged for their Windows 3.0
      printer drivers to be put in Microsoft's supplemental drivers
      library. To determine if your printer is currently supported in
      the Windows 3.0 Supplemental Driver Library, call Microsoft
      Customer Service at (800)426-9400.

      If Microsoft doesn't yet have a driver for your printer, call
      your printer manufacturer's technical support number to see if
      the printer manufacturer can supply the printer driver directly
      to you.

      If they can't provide one, ask whether your printer
      will emulate a printer that Windows does support. Emulation
      is the least-preferred solution because this may or may not
      fully support all of your printer's features.

2. Q. I am using a network that's not on the list of supported
      networks that was in the box with my Windows disks. I can print
      to a network printer from DOS but I can't print from Windows.
      How do I print from Windows with this network?

   A. Check with the company that makes your network and get its
      recommendations for using its network with Windows. The best
      solution is for your network manufacturer to provide software
      that allows Windows to use its network correctly.

      If your network manufacturer or installer can't assist you, the
      following workaround may be helpful:

      a. Start the Windows Control Panel. Open the Printers selection
         and select the printer you want to use from the "Installed
         Printers" list.

      b. Select "Configure." In the Configure dialog box, look at the
         "Ports" section. If your printer is currently set to LPT1,
         scroll down the list and select LPT1.OS2; if the current
         setting is LPT2, then change it to LPT2.OS2.

      c. Press ENTER or click OK to return to the Printers dialog box.
         Confirm that your change is reflected in your printer's
         listing, and that your printer is set to "Active." Press
         ENTER or click OK to save the changes.

         This setting causes Windows to send what it prints to MS-DOS
         so that your network can use it. This is a workaround, and it
         has its limitations. Some large files, especially large
         graphics files, might not print correctly.

3. Q. I am having trouble printing from Windows when my computer is
      connected to a printer through a printer sharing device. What
      can I do?

   A. There is no standard for how printer sharing devices are
      designed. Windows prints directly to the ports on your computer.
      If your printer sharing device doesn't provide the signals
      Windows expects, Windows may not be able to print through it.
      However, if you can print from DOS through this printer sharing
      device, use the workaround described in steps 2a, 2b, and 2c
      above. This workaround should enable you to print from Windows.

      If this workaround does not work satisfactorily, contact the
      printer sharing device manufacturer to see if the manufacturer
      has tested the printer sharing device with Windows, and to
      request assistance.

4. Q. I can't print from Windows either to a printer connected
      directly to my computer or to one on a supported network. What
      can I do?

   A. Here are three standard methods to troubleshoot and solve
      Windows printing problems:

      a. Check your Windows printer settings:

         1) Start the Windows Control Panel and open the Printers
            dialog box.

         2) Make sure your printer is listed and make sure that there
            is a printer designated as "Default Printer." The default
            printer does not need to be the printer you are trying to
            use but there does need to be one printer designated as
            the default printer.

         3) If there is no default printer, double-click the name of
            the printer you want to be the default printer, or
            highlight its name, hold down the ALT key and press D.

         4) Check to make sure your printer setup and configuration
            are correct by selecting the Configure button and then the
            Setup button.

         5) If these settings are correct, click the OK buttons all
            the way back to the Control Panel. This will save your
            changes. Choosing "Cancel" (or "Close" from the system
            icon in the upper-left corner) will abort any changes if
            you decide not to save them.

      b. Test to see if you can print from DOS. With printers other
         than PostScript printers, you can test to see if the computer
         and printer are communicating by entering this command:

            copy c:\autoexec.bat lpt1

         Press ENTER. In place of LPT1, use the port your printer is
         connected to if it is different. If you are using a laser
         printer, you may have to press the printer's form feed
         button.

         Serial printers may require special setting up. If you are
         not sure if this has been done, contact your dealer or local
         computer support person.

         If the printer did not print then there is a hardware problem
         with your printer, computer, or cabling, which may need
         servicing. If it does print, try the next procedure.

      c. Check the TEMP statement. Windows uses temporary files when
         printing. If Windows does not have a place to put these
         temporary files, you may not be able to print. To check this:

         1) Start Windows Notepad and open the AUTOEXEC.BAT file in
            the root directory.

         2) Check it for a line that reads SET TEMP=C:\WINDOWS\TEMP.
            In this example, the TEMP variable is set to a Windows
            subdirectory of the same name.

         While this TEMP statement is one that is commonly used, you
         can designate any existing directory on a hard drive or a RAM
         drive that has 2 to 3 megabytes (MB) of free space. Just make
         sure that there is a TEMP statement in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file,
         and make sure that the named path and directory actually
         exist as entered.

         A common problem is hidden space characters at the end of the
         SET TEMP line. Since space characters don't show in Windows
         Notepad, the easiest way to make sure that there are none is
         to delete the SET TEMP line and re-enter it. If there is no
         TEMP statement in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file or if you're not
         sure if it is correct, you can use the following setting:

            SET TEMP=C:\
