The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Windows for Workgroups ClipBook Viewer offers the option to "start
application on connect" when a page is shared. This article describes what
that means and when it should be used.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In addition to static information such as a picture or text, some ClipBook
pages contain a reference to the application that the information
originated in. If you use the Paste Link option to paste the contents of
this kind of ClipBook page into an application that supports Dynamic Data
Exchange (DDE) or OLE, you establish a DDE or OLE link to the application
that created the original information. The application that the page is
paste linked into is the "client" application, while the application that
contains the original information is the "server" application. While this
link is active, the client application receives any updates to the
information if it changes in the server application.
<P>
For a link to be established, the server application must be running. The
"start application on connect" check box simply tells the system that it is
OK to try to start this application on your machine when someone on another
machine attempts to establish such a link. If you only want to share
information that you are currently working on, but don't want your work
interrupted while the system restarts the application at some later time,
you should not check this box. If you are sharing information of a more
lasting interest or information that is an important part of other
documents in the workgroup, you should check this box so that you don't
have to remember to have this application running at all times.
<P>
NOTE: For the system to start your application, your application must
be either:

<UL><LI>On the PATH if the link that is being established is a DDE
   link
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Registered as an OLE server in the registration database if
   the link that is being established is an OLE link.
<P></UL>
