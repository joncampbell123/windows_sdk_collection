The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
You may receive the following error message when using Windows for
Workgroups:
<P>
<PRE>    The protocol manager has reported an incomplete binding

</PRE>The message can be preceded by a number, such as 5733 or 5773. For
example:
<P>
<PRE>    Error 5733: The protocol manager has reported an incomplete
    binding.

</PRE>In most cases, Windows still functions after this message; however,
all network services are disabled.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This message occurs due to several conditions, including:

<UL><LI>Incorrect NDIS Network Interface Card (NIC) driver loaded in the
   CONFIG.SYS file

<LI>Incorrect network card configuration (PROTOCOL.INI)

<LI>Hardware problem(s)
<P>
</UL><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Use the information in the following paragraphs to eliminate the
conditions listed above.
<P>
<P><h3>Incorrect NDIS NIC Driver Loaded in the CONFIG.SYS File</h3>
 
<P>
This message may result if you have installed the wrong network card
driver. To verify that the driver you selected matches the network
card you are using, choose the Network icon from Control Panel. If the
network card you are using is not listed during setup, check the
manufacturer's suggested emulation.
<P>
The network card supplier may need to provide an NDIS compatible
driver. If the card you are trying to install is not listed in Control
Panel, contact the network card manufacturer for a specific NDIS
driver that works with Windows for Workgroups.
<P>
The order of the network drivers in the CONFIG.SYS file is also
important. For example, protocol manager (PROTMAN.DOS) must load
before any other Windows for Workgroup network drivers. If PROTMAN.DOS
does not load first, you may receive the following variation of the
message above:
<P>
<PRE>   Error 5741: The protocol manager was unable to bind.

</PRE><h3>Incorrect Network Card Configuration (PROTOCOL.INI)</h3>
 
<P>
The protocol manager error message can also occur if the network
adapter is configured incorrectly. The configuration settings include
IRQ, Base I/O port, and Base Memory Address. To verify these settings,
choose the Network icon from Control Panel.
<P>
Some network adapters do not have an on-board transceiver, and use an
external transceiver to transmit data over the medium. If your network
adapter works this way, add the following entry to the section of the
PROTOCOL.INI file that refers to the specific net card using the
external transceiver:
<P>
<PRE>   [MS$NIUPC]
   TRANSCEIVER=EXTERNAL

</PRE>You can also correct your settings by deleting the PROTOCOL.INI,
PROTMAN.DOS, WORKGRP.SYS, and other Workgroup network driver files.
Then, from Control Panel, choose the Network icon, and indicate the
correct network adapter and configuration settings.
<P>
Note: Each time the PROTOCOL.INI file is updated, the old one is saved
with a sequentially numbered extension (that is, PROTOCOL.000,
PROTOCOL.001, PROTOCOL.002, and so forth). By referring this naming
convention, you may be able to recover an earlier PROTOCOL.INI that
was once configured correctly.
<P>
<P><h3>Hardware Problem(s)</h3>
 
<P>
This error message could also indicate problems with the network
adapter. Check to make sure that the adapter is seated properly in the
computer's expansion slot. If the error message continues, try
inserting a different network adapter, then verify the correct setting
for that card. Check for other potential problems including incorrect
cabling, improper installation of T-connectors and terminators, and
check other connections within the workgroup.
