<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article discusses known problems with the Texas Instruments
Graphics Adapter (TIGA) video driver version 2.0 release 1.2 for
Microsoft Windows version 3.0. The date of this driver is 12/21/90.
The information in this article can be found in the text file that
comes on the disk with the TIGA driver.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>MS-DOS-Based Applications</h3>
 
<P>
When you run two full-screen MS-DOS-based applications in 386 enhanced
mode and press ALT+TAB to cycle directly from one MS-DOS-based
application to the other, the cycling title screen remains on the
screen. The second MS-DOS-based application appears to have a
corrupted screen.
<P>
Switching to Windows and back to the MS-DOS-based application properly
restores the screen of the MS-DOS-based application. The ALT+ESC key
combination does not exhibit this problem.
<P>
<P><h3>Running MS-DOS in a Window</h3>
 
<P>
When you run MS-DOS in a window, the MS-DOS cursor disappears when the
cursor is at the bottom of the window. (The cursor is actually below
the edge of the window.) Use the MS-DOS CLS command to clear the
MS-DOS screen and move the cursor to the top of the window.
<P>
<P><h3>Shelling to MS-DOS in Real Mode</h3>
 
<P>
When you run Windows in real mode and the TIGA is set at 4 bits per
pixel, exiting an MS-DOS shell sometimes causes the color palette to
be reloaded incorrectly. Exit and restart Windows to reset the color
palette.
<P>
<P><h3>Using 256-Color Display</h3>
 
<P>
If the desktop wallpaper is a 256-color bitmap and an application uses
a different color palette, when the application is minimized or
terminated, the desktop wallpaper's colors may be changed. Exit and
restart Windows to reset the color palette.
<P>
<P><h3>Mouse Pointer Leaves a Trail</h3>
 
<P>
If you select custom colors using the Control Panel Colors icon, the
cross hair (mouse pointer) leaves a trail of black pixels. At this
time, no solution for this problem is available.
<P>
<P><h3>Asymetrix ToolBook - Animation Primer</h3>
 
<P>
On the title screen, when the bouncing red ball moves behind the text
boxes, bits of the black text pixels disappear. As the ball passes
behind a section that has disappeared, the bits sometimes reappear. At
this time, no solution for this problem is available.
<P>
<P><h3>Micrografx Designer</h3>
 
<P>
Micrografx Designer comes with a sample drawing of a highway scene,
ART-WORK.DRW. The line in the middle-road dividing line should be
distinctly dashed. Instead it looks like a dotted line. The road color
is light gray instead of dark gray.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Windows Paintbrush</h3>
 
<P>
Flipping a selected bitmap region vertically or horizontally will
often cause white pixels to be left at the edge of the selection
box. Invert the image twice to restore the image.
<P>
The spray pattern for the spray can is wrong. At this time, no
solution for this problem is available.
<P>
In 16 colors, green and cyan colors are not displayed correctly. The
color green consists of green and yellow. The color cyan consists of
cyan and white. This does not happen on the inside of shapes.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft PowerPoint</h3>
 
<P>
Text consists of vertical lines instead of solid characters. The
solution is to use colored text at 8 bits per pixel only.
<P>
<P><h3>Terminal</h3>
 
<P>
NOTE: This Terminal information pertains to the 1024 x 768
(TIGA48.DRV) driver only.
<P>
The text buffer window in Terminal does not display text properly with
the System font. When scrolling back through the text in the buffer,
the characters become distorted. All other fonts work correctly.
