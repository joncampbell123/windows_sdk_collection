The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you install an updated driver from the Windows Driver Library (WDL)
for Microsoft Windows 3.1, the .EXE file for the updated driver must be
executed in an empty directory before you install the new drivers with the
Windows Setup program.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When updated drivers for Windows 3.1 are obtained from the MSDL or another
source, they are often in an .EXE format. This indicates that the file is
self extracting (that is, once the .EXE filename is typed, the file
extracts the individual files it contains into the current directory).
<P>
Some of these files (primarily the updated video drivers) are still
compressed once the separate files are extracted from the .EXE file.
To make them usable, they must be installed using the Windows Setup
program.
<P>
If the .EXE file is executed in the WINDOWS or WINDOW\SYSTEM
directory, the files will not be expanded and may cause Windows to be
unusable.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps for Installing a WDL Driver File with Windows Setup</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create a directory in which to expand the individual driver files.

<P><LI>Copy the file into the temporary directory and run it by typing its
   .EXE name. For example, to expand the TSENG1.EXE driver, type
   TSENG1. This will extract the individual files from the .EXE file.

<P><LI>Run Setup from the Windows directory MS-DOS command prompt or while
   in Windows by executing Setup from the Windows Setup icon in the
   Main group. For the appropriate hardware setting (such as Display),
   choose:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Other (requires disk from manufacturer)
</PRE>
<P><LI>Type the directory name created in step 1 and press ENTER.

<P><LI>Select the driver to be installed and press ENTER. This will expand
   and copy the updated files to the WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory.

<P><LI>Close and restart Windows.
<P>
</OL>For a complete listing of the WDL's contents and instructions for
obtaining the WDL, query on "<B><A href="../win3x/q82006.htm">Q82006</A></B>" in the Microsoft Knowledge Base.
