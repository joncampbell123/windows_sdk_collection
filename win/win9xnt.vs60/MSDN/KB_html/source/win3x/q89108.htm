The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article discusses running Grapevine LAN with Microsoft Windows. The
following topics are included in this article:

<UL><LI>SYSTEM.INI settings
<LI>Disable SMARTDrive version 4.0's write cache
<LI>Beeping network software
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>SYSTEM.INI Settings</h3>
 
<P>
The Grapevine LAN versions 3.1b and 4.1 may stop or hang when running
Windows in 386 enhanced mode if the following two entries are not in
the SYSTEM.INI's [386enh] section
<P>
<PRE>   EMMEXCLUDE=xxxx-xxxx

</PRE>where xxxx-xxxx is the UMA range the network card is using. If you are
using a UMA/UMB provider such as EMM386.EXE, then exclude this range
in its command line.
<P>
<PRE>   ALLVMSEXCLUSIVE=YES

</PRE>When this is added to the SYSTEM.INI, it precludes running
MS-DOS-based applications in the background or in a window.
<P>
<P><h3>Disable SMARTDrive Version 4.0's Write Cache</h3>
 
<P>
When running Grapevine LAN version 1.x, then disable SMARTDrive's
Write cache by supplying drive letters at the end of the command line
in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file:
<P>
<PRE>   C:\WINDOWS\SMARTDRV.SYS C D

</PRE>This disables Write cache on hard drive C and D. As a workaround, you
could also use the SMARTDrive that came with Windows 3.0 or MS-DOS 5.0
<P>
<P><h3>Beeping Network Software</h3>
 
<P>
When running version 1.4g of Grapevine LAN, you may hear tones when
accessing some options inside of Windows, such as the Virtual Memory
button.
<P>
Grapevine LAN sends a series of descending tones as a warning that
a drive specified in the Make Directories Available To Network section
of the Define Drives menu is offline. This warning is not received
when running in the menu mode. For more information, contact Grapevine
technical support.
<P>
The Grapevine product included here is manufactured by a vendor independent
of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this
product's performance or reliability.
