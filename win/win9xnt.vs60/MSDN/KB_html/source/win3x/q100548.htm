The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
To ensure smooth interoperability between Windows NT and Windows for
Workgroups, there are several issues that must be addressed. When
setting up your network, be aware of the following issues:

<UL><LI>Browsemaster Conflicts
<LI>Guest Accounts
<LI>User Name Duplication
<P>
</UL>This article discusses each of these issues.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Browsemaster Conflicts</h3>
 
<P>
Browsemaster contentions can occur between Windows for Workgroups
workstations and Windows NT workstations when a workgroup or domain
contains at least one machine of each type. You may have difficulty
seeing servers in a Windows NT network from a Windows for Workgroups
workstation if the workstation is a backup browsemaster and not
registered in the Windows NT network. To work around this problem, add
the following line to the [network] section of the SYSTEM.INI files in
all Windows for Workgroup machines on the network:
<P>
<PRE>   MaintainServerList=no

</PRE>This workaround stops all Windows for Workgroups workstations from
trying to be browsemasters. If you use this workaround, you need to
ensure that at least one Windows NT machine (workstation or server) in
the workgroup or domain is running at all times. Until a Windows NT
machine is running or a user changes the value of the
MaintainServerList variable to "auto" and reboots, no browsing can
occur (you receive error 6118). Another way to enable browsing in this
situation is to log onto the domain or workgroup with a valid account
(even a guest account works).
<P>
<P><h3>Guest Accounts</h3>
 
<P>
Guest accounts should remain enabled on domain controllers. Instead of
removing guest accounts to restrict access to certain services, simply
remove any undesired guest account rights in User Manager.
<P>
<P><h3>User Name Duplication</h3>
 
<P>
There should not be user name duplicates on different domains. If a
user name is duplicated across different domains, there will be
inconsistent results when a logon is attempted from a Windows for
Workgroups workstation on that Windows NT network.
