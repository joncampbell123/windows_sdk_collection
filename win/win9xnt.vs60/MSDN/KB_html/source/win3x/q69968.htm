<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When Microsoft Windows 3.0 is set up on a network workstation via the
SETUP /N command, there are nine possible choices for pointing
devices. It is possible to add additional pointing device drivers for
touch screens, digitizing tablets, and trackballs by editing the
SETUP.INF before running SETUP /N on the individual workstations.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Use the following outline to add additional pointing device drivers
via the SETUP.INF file.

<OL><P><LI>Copy the appropriate Windows 3.00 device drivers into the shared
   Windows directory.

<P><LI>Edit the SETUP.INF file with a standard ASCII text editor and
   locate the pointing.device section:
<P>
<P><PRE>      [pointing.device]
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      Identifier=x:drivename, "Description", x:virtualdrivername,
      dosdriver
</PRE><P>
<PRE>Parameter         Description
----------       ------------

Identifier       Driver short name
drivername       Driver filename ending in .DRV
Description      Title of driver used at setup
Virtualdriver    (VMD) Most pointing devices use the internal driver
                 in WIN386.EXE, but the manufacturer may supply one
                 that will end in .386, e.g. "1:summa.386"

Dosdriver        Pointing device driver in the CONFIG.SYS or
                 AUTOEXEC.BAT that will be replaced by new version if
                 selected (for example, replace old MOUSE.SYS with new
                 version)

</PRE><P><LI>Add a blank line to the end of this section, and, on it, enter the
   additional driver.
<P>
</OL><h3>Example</h3>
 
<P>
To add the following two drivers, SUMMA.DRV and SUMMA.386, add the new
line as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   Summa = 1:SUMMA.DRV, "Summa IS/100", 1:SUMMA.386

</PRE></OL>The "1:" or "x:" is showing disk number, where driver is located. On
network installations this is not valid.
<P>
The SETUP.INF file is a comma-delineated text file formatted for 160
columns that supplies customized directions to the SETUP.EXE.
<P>
<P><h3>Preferred Workstation Setup Method</h3>
 
<P>
Install Windows 3.0 on a network (see pages 543-556 of the "Microsoft
Windows User's Guide"), and then run the SETUP /N command on each
workstation. In some instances (for example, large workstation groups) it
may not be efficient to do this and then customize each workstation
individually. By editing the SETUP.INF file with a text editor, it is
possible to enhance the SETUP /N command so that it customizes each
workstation to a company standard.
