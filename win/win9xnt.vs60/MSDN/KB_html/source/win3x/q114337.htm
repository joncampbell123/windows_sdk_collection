The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After you install Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 with a third-party
network as the primary network, or after you install Windows for Workgroups
3.11 with the /H switch from a Novell NetWare network, you encounter one or
both of the following situations:

<UL><LI>When you start Windows for Workgroups, a dialog box with the following
   message appears:
<P>
<P><PRE>      NETDDEX loads NetDDE and CLIPSRV, and a computer name is
      required. Please enter computer name:
</PRE>
<LI>When Windows for Workgroups starts, the Chat icon appears in the
   Network group.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
NETDDEX requires NetBIOS. If NetBIOS services have not been started for the
primary network, NetDDE services are not available.
<P>
If you use the /H switch to install Windows for Workgroups with Novell
NetWare as the primary network and you are using "NETWORK=NOVELL/00032600"
in the [Configuration] section of the SETUP.SHH file, the Windows for
Workgroups Setup program installs NetDDE services and the Chat utility.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 

<UL><LI>If the use of NetDDE is not required, remove NETDDEX.EXE from the
   Load= line in the [Windows] section of the WIN.INI file.

<LI>OR -

<LI>NetBIOS services are provided differently for each third-party
   network that can be set up as the primary network. For instructions
   on how to provide NetBIOS services for your network, consult with
   the network administrator or network vendor, or refer to the
   documentation.
<P>
   For example, if Novell NetWare is selected as the primary network,
   in order for NetDDE to function properly, the Novell terminate-and-
   stay-resident (TSR) program that provides NetBIOS services under
   NetWare, NETBIOS.EXE, must be run before starting Windows.

<LI>OR -

<LI>If you are installing Windows for Workgroups with the /H switch,
   edit the WINNET.INF file and remark out or remove the following
   line and section.
<P>
   NOTE: Editing .INF files is not encouraged as a troubleshooting
   technique. Make a backup copy of the .INF file before you edit it.
<P>
<P><PRE>      [novell3x]
<PRE></PRE>      install=netdde_appsx   --   Remark out this line only.

      [netdde_apps]          --   Remark out this entire section.

   To remark out a line, insert a semicolon (;) at the beginning of the
   line. To remark out a section, insert an "X" at the beginning of the
   section name. For example, to remark out a section called [TEST], change
   the section name to [XTEST].

</PRE></UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows for Workgroups
version 3.11. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you set up a third-party network as the primary network, Windows for
Workgroups Setup adds NETDDEX to the Load= line of the WIN.INI file
regardless of whether NetBIOS services are loaded at that time.
<P>
NetWare is manufactured by Novell, Inc., a vendor independent of Microsoft;
we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
performance or reliability.
