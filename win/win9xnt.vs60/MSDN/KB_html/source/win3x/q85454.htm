The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.1, 3.11
 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The following information was taken from the T2HINTS.WRI file included with
the Microsoft Windows Resource Kit for operating system version 3.1.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>TrueType and Printers</h3>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Hewlett-Packard LaserJet, LaserJet+, and LaserJet 500 (PCL III)</h3>
 
<P>
TrueType fonts are always rendered in the graphics band and are only
available when printing at 300 dpi.
<P>
Hewlett-Packard  LaserJet Series II (PCL IV)
 
<P>
Default setting is to download TrueType fonts to the printer for speed
and reduced job size. If more than 16 TrueType fonts (each face,
style, and point size is considered a separate font) are used on the
same page, the remaining TrueType fonts will be drawn in the graphics
band. This is done automatically and requires no user intervention.
<P>
Cannot print 'white' TrueType text. To print white text on a dark
background you must turn ON 'Print TrueType as Graphics' in the
printer setup dialog and print at 300 dpi.
<P>
TrueType text shows through an opaque graphics object. To properly
overlay opaque graphics over TrueType text you must turn ON 'Print
TrueType as Graphics' in the printer setup dialog and print at 300
dpi.
<P>
Hewlett-Packard  LaserJet IID, LaserJet IIP (PCL IV)
 
<P>
Same limitations as the Series II except that more than 16 fonts can
be on the same page without switching to the graphics band.
<P>
On IIP printers with 1MB or more memory, TIFF compression is used.
<P>
<P><h3>Hewlett-Packard LaserJet III family (PCL V)</h3>
 
<P>
More than 16 fonts can be on the same page without switching to the
graphics band.
<P>
White text can be printed without using 'TrueType as Graphics'.
<P>
<P><h3>PostScript Printers</h3>
 
<P>
Some printed characters are slightly different from those on the
display. This is due to our TrueType fonts being mapped to
corresponding fonts in the PostScript printer, for example, Arial is
substituted with Helvetica. This substitution should not effect line
or page breaks and is on by default.
<P>
<P><h3>TrueType and Applications</h3>
 
<P>
Common Application Problems:
<P>
At small sizes TrueType fonts look like a simple Serif or Sans Serif
font on the display. This is because at small sizes, on the display
only, Windows selects a hand-tuned bitmap font to preserve
readability.
<P>
At small sizes bold or bold italic TrueType fonts don't look bold on
the display. This is because our TrueType fonts adjust the widths of
the lines making up the character to preserve readability, even at
small point sizes. Selecting an expanded or zoomed view of the
document or printing it will show that the fonts are bold.
<P>
Some applications will use a bold or italic style of the font
requested rather than the regular style. If this happens, check the
[Fonts] section in your WIN.INI file to see if the bold/italic style
of the font you selected comes before the regular entry. If this is
the case, move the non-regular style to below the regular style, exit
and restart Windows, then see if the problem appears again.
<P>
<P><h3>Aldus PageMaker 4.0</h3>
 
<P>
PageMaker displays all available fonts in a single column cascaded
menu. If enough fonts are installed, the list can exceed the available
height of the screen. If this happens, use the Type-&gt;Type specs...
dialog, all available fonts are in the Fonts combobox.
<P>
<P><h3>Ami Pro 2.0</h3>
 
<P>
If you have letters that run into each other when displaying a
TrueType font, you should go into View-&gt;View Preferences and turn OFF
<PRE>'Display as Printed'.

</PRE><h3>CorelDRAW</h3>
 
<P>
CorelDRAW uses its own fonts and will not enumerate any TrueType
fonts.
<P>
<P><h3>Micrografx  Charisma</h3>
 
<P>
With a PostScript printer as the currently selected printer, you will
see each TrueType font enumerated twice in the choose font dialog box.
This is because this application sees the font enumerated for the
screen and also for the printer and will display an entry for each.
<P>
<P><h3>Micrografx Designer 3.1</h3>
 
<P>
With a PostScript printer as the currently selected printer, you will
see each TrueType font enumerated twice in the choose font dialog box.
This is because this application sees the font enumerated for the
screen and also for the printer and will display an entry for each.
<P>
<P><h3>Micrografx Windows Draw</h3>
 
<P>
With a PostScript printer as the currently selected printer, you will
see each TrueType font enumerated twice in the choose font dialog box.
This is because this application sees the font enumerated for the
screen and also for the printer and will display an entry for each.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft PowerPoint 2.0e</h3>
 
<P>
PowerPoint will not enumerate TrueType fonts in the Style-Fonts menu
when the selected target printer is 'Default Target'. To enumerate
TrueType fonts, select File-Printer Setup... and choose the display or
appropriate target printer.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Word for Windows</h3>
 
<P>
Word for Windows 2.0, when in 'Zoom Page Width' and 'Zoom Whole Page'
mode, will sometimes cause text that is bold/bold italic to appear to
normal or just italic. This is because, at the smaller sizes, TrueType
bold fonts only have 1 pixel wide stems as in the regular font.
Switching back to 100% view typically returns the font to a bold
appearance.
<P>
<P><h3>WordPerfect for Windows</h3>
 
<P>
In the choose font dialog, you will see every TrueType font
enumerated, not just the font family name. In WordPerfect for Windows
you will see Arial, Arial Bold, Arial Bold Italic and Arial Italic.
<P>
If you install additional fonts, such as the Lucida fonts, only the
fonts that have 'standard' styles will be listed. For example, Lucida
Bright comes in four styles, Regular, Demibold, Demibold Italic and
Italic. Since Demibold is not a standard style, only Lucida Bright and
Lucida Bright Italic will show up in the choose font dialog. Select
DemiBold fonts by clicking on the 'Bold' button in the dialog.
