The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11
<LI>Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 3.x, 4.x, 5.0, 6.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Windows 3.0, you receive an unrecoverable application error (UAE)
or a "Violated System Integrity" error when you try to access a file.
In Windows 3.1 enhanced mode, your system stops responding (hangs)
when you try to access a file. In either Windows version, printer
output may be garbled.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
These symptoms may indicate that you have cross-linked files or lost
clusters (or allocation units).
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Running the MS-DOS CHKDSK utility (CHKDSK.COM) can identify these
problems and, optionally, correct them. The following is the correct
syntax for running the CHKDSK command
<P>
<PRE>   CHKDSK [&lt;drive&gt;:] [&lt;pathname&gt;] [/F] [/V]

</PRE>where:

<UL><LI>&lt;drive&gt; specifies the drive is to be analyzed.
<LI>&lt;pathname&gt; allows the specification of a particular directory and
   file type using wildcard characters.
<LI>/F tells MS-DOS to repair any errors found.
<LI>/V echoes the filename(s) as they are being checked.
<P>
</UL>The parameters enclosed in brackets ([]) are optional. If you use
these parameters, type them without the brackets.
<P>
Parameters enclosed in angle brackets (&lt;&gt;) are variables. Substitute
actual values for these variables. For example, substitute
<P>
<PRE>   C:

</PRE>for:
<P>
<PRE>   &lt;drive&gt;:

</PRE>WARNING: Before using CHKDSK, exit Windows. You should NEVER run this
utility with the /F parameter from Windows; doing so corrupts files on
the hard disk.
<P>
CAUTION: Running CHKDSK/F on a hard drive with a large number of lost
clusters may result in damaged files, loss of data, and the loss of
directory integrity. For more information regarding CHKDSK, please read the
"Microsoft MS-DOS User's Guide and User's Reference" (pages 44-45 for
version 4.01 and pages 381-383 for version 5.0).
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Cross-Linked Files</h3>
 
<P>
Cross-linked files occur when two or more files have been allocated
the same cluster. One or both of the files may contain information
belonging to the other.
<P>
NOTE: If you are using Undelete and the Delete Sentry method of
protection, remove the memory-resident portion of Undelete by typing
"undelete /unload" (without the quotation marks)at an MS-DOS command
prompt before you delete any cross-linked files.
<P>
<P><h3>Lost Clusters</h3>
 
<P>
Lost clusters occur when a file is deleted from the directory listing,
but the file allocation table (FAT) still shows the clusters allocated
to the file.
<P>
The CHKDSK utility asks if you want the lost clusters converted to a
file. If you answer "Yes," these clusters are allocated to a file
named FILE&lt;nnnn&gt;.CHK, where &lt;nnnn&gt; is a number. This file appears in
the root directory of the drive. If you answer "No," the lost clusters
are deallocated and are available for use again.
<P>
<P><h3>CHKDSK Command</h3>
 
<P>
The MS-DOS CHKDSK command checks the directory structure and the FAT
for inconsistencies such as the following:

<UL><LI>Invalid pointers to data areas

<LI>Bad file attributes in directory entries

<LI>Damage to a portion of the directory that makes it impossible to
   check one or more paths

<LI>Damage to an entire directory that makes the files contained in that
   directory inaccessible

<LI>Defective disk sectors in the FAT

<LI>Invalid cluster (disk allocation unit) numbers in the FAT

<LI>Lost clusters (clusters are identified that are not assigned to a
   file)

<LI>Cross-linking of files on the same cluster (more than one file has
   been assigned the same cluster)
