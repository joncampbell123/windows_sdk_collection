The information in this article applies to:
<P>
<PRE>  - Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11
</PRE> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If the OK and Browse buttons are unavailable (dimmed) for a particular file
extension in Windows version 3.1 File Manager when you choose Associate
from the File menu, then the file extension is on the "Programs=" line in
the [Windows] section of the WIN.INI file.
<P>
If a file extension is on the "Programs=" line under Windows version 3.0,
the Associate option is unavailable in File Manager when you attempt to
associate the file extension with an application.
<P>
To associate the file extension with an application, remove the file
extension from the "Programs=" line in the [Windows] section of the
WIN.INI.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Windows treats files whose file extensions are on the "Programs=" line
as if they are executable files.
<P>
To determine if the file extension in question is on the "Programs="
line, run File Manager and look at the icon next to a file that has
the file extension in question. If the icon next to the file appears
as a rectangular gray box with a green bar across the top (or a
rectangular box with a smaller rectangular box within it), then that
file extension is on the "Programs=" line within the WIN.INI file.
<P>
The icon should appear exactly like the icons to the left of files
with the .EXE, .PIF, .COM, or .BAT file extensions.
<P>
The same behavior may occur if you try to associate a file without a
file extension.
<P>
