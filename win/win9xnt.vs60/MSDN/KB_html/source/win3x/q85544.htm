<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Bitstream Fontware Installation Kit is available through a fulfillment
coupon included with the retail version of Microsoft PowerPoint for
Windows, version 2.0. This starter kit installs fonts for Windows-based
applications only; however, it can be merged with other starter kits to
provide support for multiple applications.
<P>
This article discusses problems and error messages you may encounter
when using the Bitstream Fontware Installation Kit.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Common Problems</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>When trying to make fonts for Windows- and non-Windows-based
   applications, you may receive an error message stating that Windows
   fonts are not the same as non-Windows fonts made for the same
   printer.
<P>
   In some cases, fonts for Microsoft Windows and non-Windows
   applications cannot be made simultaneously, even though the fonts
   are for the same laser printer. This is because non-Windows-based
   applications require fonts in a different form for that printer.
   Make the fonts for Microsoft Windows, then make the fonts for
   non-Windows-based applications.

<P><LI>When you make fonts with the Bitstream Fontware Installation Kit,
   not all the phases can be completed.
<P>
   The system may be out of memory. Check the Fontware error log for
   this "make fonts" session to see if this is the case. If it is,
   there may be memory-resident programs or device drivers loaded in
   the system that you can remove temporarily. Make backup copies of
   the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files, edit the original files to
   increase the amount of free memory, then reboot the computer under
   this new configuration.

<P><LI>The Bitstream Fontware Installation Kit never asks for disk 2 of
   the Bitstream Scalable Typeface Package.
<P>
   Some files in the Bitstream Scalable Typeface Package may not be
   needed, depending on the devices selected when Fontware was set up.
   If the kit doesn't need disk 2 of the Bitstream Scalable Typeface
   Package, it won't ask for it.

<P><LI>The Bitstream Fontware Installation Kit cannot be used to install
   Bitstream SoftFonts.
<P>
   Although SoftFonts and Fontware are both made by Bitstream, they
   are separate products. SoftFonts should be installed using the
   SoftFont Installer provided with the Hewlett-Packard (HP) LaserJet
   printer driver.
<P>
</OL><h3>Error Messages</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>After you press F10 to make fonts, the following error may occur:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Time and Space Estimates. Not enough disk space available
</PRE><P>
   Delete some font requests and check the estimates again. The
   Bitstream Fontware Installation Kit (FIK) has checked the available
   disk space against its space estimates and determined that there is
   not enough room on the disk.

<P><LI>When you are making fonts, the following error may occur:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Some typeface information missing. Go to Add/Delete Bitstream
      Fontware Typefaces
</PRE><P>
   You selected a typeface that the Bitstream Fontware Installation
   Kit does not find on the system, even though the name is listed in
   the Make Fonts Windows. This may happen if both a PostScript PDL
   and a non-PostScript PDL printer are installed and the typeface was
   added before setting up Fontware support for the PostScript PDL
   printer. Choose Add/Delete Bitstream Fontware Typefaces, and add
   the typeface again. Then make the fonts.
<P>
   If you are attempting to make PostScript PDL fonts from the free
   Dutch and Swiss typefaces, the same error message may occur. Times
   Roman and Helvetica are resident on most PostScript PDL printers;
   the files needed for Dutch and Swiss PostScript PDL fonts are not
   shipped with the starter kit. Either purchase Bitstream Scalable
   Typeface Packages for Dutch and Swiss, or select Times Roman and
   Helvetica in the Windows application.

<P><LI>If you request point sizes for a Symbol typeface, the following
   message may occur:
<P>
<P><PRE>      This typeface requires a different character set. Go to the
      Control Panel and select a different character set
</PRE><P>
   Go to the Fontware Control Panel and select one of the symbol
   character sets available to make fonts for the device(s). Symbol
   typefaces require special symbol character sets.

<P><LI>When adding typefaces in Fontware the following message may occur:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Warning: Those typefaces that were copied may not be usable for
      making PostScript PDL Printer fonts
</PRE><P>
   This means that ESC was pressed before adding the second typeface
   disk that contains information Fontware needs to make fonts for
   PostScript PDL printers. Try adding the typeface again.

<P><LI>When setting up Fontware and adding a typeface, the following
   message may occur:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Unable to copy all typeface information. Errors occurred while
      copying typefaces.
</PRE><P>
   This message is generated when the Fontware kit is unable to read
   from the disk it is trying to copy. If using a backup of a Fontware
   Installation Kit disk or a Bitstream Scalable Typeface disk, exit
   the kit, make a new backup copy, and try again. If the disk is an
   original typeface disk, obtain a replacement disk.

<P><LI>The following message may occur when you enter the Fontware
   directory name while running the Fontware Setup program.
<P>
<P><PRE>      Unable to make this directory. Choose a different directory
</PRE><P>
   You have entered a directory name that the kit cannot create on
   the hard disk. Press ESC and enter a different directory name.
   This may indicate a general problem with writing to the hard disk,
   or may be the name of a file that already exists. (Note that
   Fontware will not accept any directory name that MS-DOS does not
   accept as a directory name.)

<P><LI>When exiting Fontware during setup, the following message may
   occur:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Warning: Aborting the setup process at this stage may leave
      your Fontware directory in an unusable state, requiring a
      complete reinstallation of Fontware. Do you want to abort
      setup?
</PRE><P>
   This message occurs only after Fontware has begun copying files.
   The Fontware Setup program is not completed at the time of exiting
   Fontware because some files may be in an unusable state on the hard
   disk. Fontware for Microsoft Windows may need to be reinstalled. If
   Fontware for non-Windows-based applications is set up in the same
   Fontware directory, Fontware for those applications may also need
   to be set up.
