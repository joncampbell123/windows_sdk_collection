The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.0, 3.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The following article contains information on SCSI device support in
Microsoft Windows version 3.0 enhanced mode.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Western Digital 7000 FASST (WD7000FASST)</h3>
 
<P>
The WD7000FASST has been tested with, and is directly supported by,
Windows 3.0. This controller is also sold by NCR as original equipment
in some 386 machines.
<P>
Columbia Data Products has Western Digital 7000 FASST SCSI hard disk
controller drivers that are compatible with Microsoft Windows version
3.0. The version of the SST driver for Windows 3.0 is 3.36. This driver
is available from Columbia Data Products for a fee, and is included with
some Western Digital controllers.
<P>
This package includes the drivers SSTBIO.SYS and SSTDRIVE.SYS. For more
information, contact Columbia Data Products.
<P>
<P><h3>Adaptec 1542A, 1542B, or 1640</h3>
 
<P>
These Adaptec SCSI host adapters have been informally tested under Windows
3.0 and have been found to function correctly.
<P>
To work with Windows 3.0, these devices require an optional Adaptec
software package known as the Adaptec ASPI MS-DOS Manager. This package
contains the drivers ASPI4DOS.SYS and ASPIDISK.SYS, along with an
installation program. The package should be version 2.1 or later for
proper operation under Windows 3.0 enhanced mode.
<P>
<P><h3>Future Domain SCSI</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft has not tested Future Domain host adapters with Windows 3.0.
For compatibility information, contact Future Domain technical support.
<P>
According to Future Domain, the company has tested its adapters with
Windows 3.0. Future Domain supplies a device driver that should be placed
after SmartDrive in the CONFIG.SYS for proper operation. The device driver
is LDRIVE.SYS for MS-DOS versions 3.3 or earlier, and HDDEVICE.SYS for
MS-DOS versions 4.0 or later.
<P>
<P><h3>Seagate ST01 or ST02</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft has not tested Seagate SCSI host adapters with Windows 3.0. For
compatibility information, contact Seagate technical support.
<P>
<P><h3>Distributed Processing Technology (DPT) PM2001, PM3011, PM2012A</h3>
 
<P>
DPT SCSI host adapters have been informally tested under Windows 3.0 and
have been found to function correctly if used with DPT's SmartDriver for
MS-DOS device driver (SKYDRV1.SYS) version 1.34 or later. For more
information, contact DPT technical support.
