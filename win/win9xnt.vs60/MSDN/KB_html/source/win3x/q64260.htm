<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you run a batch file from the Microsoft Windows File Run command in
Program Manager, you are returned to Windows after completion of the batch
file. This happens whether you start the batch file from an icon or a PIF
file. To remain at an MS-DOS prompt after the batch file has been executed,
include COMMAND.COM as the last command in the batch file.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Windows automatically closes the window upon exiting any program running
under it. When you run a batch file from Windows, no matter how it is
evoked, Windows considers it a program that is closed upon completion of
the steps in the batch file. The only way to avoid returning to the Program
Manager screen is to have the last command in the batch file start another
copy of COMMAND.COM; then the virtual machine is maintained until that
COMMAND.COM is exited.
<P>
You do not have to type "EXIT" (without the quotation marks) twice to quit
this virtual machine and return to the Program Manager. The first instance
of COMMAND.COM is terminated upon completion of the batch file. Only the
second instance of COMMAND.COM, the one started as the last command within
the batch file, remains open until you type "EXIT" to return to Program
Manager.
