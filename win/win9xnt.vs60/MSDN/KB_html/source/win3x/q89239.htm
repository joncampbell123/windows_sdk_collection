<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article discusses why Novell NetWare 286 servers may stop responding
(hang) when Windows is run on multiple workstations connected to the
server.
<P>
NetWare 286 servers have a 16K dynamic memory pool that's shared by all
workstations that are connected to the server. Each workstation logged on
to the server uses 200 bytes of this 16K. In addition, each MS-DOS-based
application started from a workstation running Windows uses 200 bytes of
the 16K if the workstation is logged onto the server. When the 16K is
depleted, the server stops responding (hangs).
<P>
This problem does not occur with NetWare 386 servers; the use of the 16K
dynamic memory pool is a limitation in NetWare 286.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To workaround this limitation, add the following line to the [NETWARE]
section of the SYSTEM.INI file.
<P>
<PRE>   NWShareHandles=Yes

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
NetWare 286 servers store 200-byte entries for each user that is logged on.
These entries are kept in Dynamic Memory Pool #1 (DMP1). You can view the
Dynamic Memory Pools by running the FCONSOLE command, choosing STATISTICS,
and then SUMMARY. The DMP1 is limited to about 16K in size. The server
stops responding (hangs) if this space is used up. NetWare 386 does not
share this limitation because it can dynamically allocate more memory to
the pool.
<P>
Normally, it take about 83 users to exhaust this memory pool. However,
Windows is capable of running multiple MS-DOS-based applications, on one
computer. Each MS-DOS-based application is considered a separate logon for
the purposes of memory pool allocation, an uses another 200 bytes from the
16K memory pool. Therefore, it is possible to hang the server with only 17
workstations running 5 MS-DOS-based applications each.
