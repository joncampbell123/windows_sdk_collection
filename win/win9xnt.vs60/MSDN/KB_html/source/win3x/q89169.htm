<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article discusses three topics regarding running Sun's PC/NFS
network with Windows 3.0. PC/NFS is not a supported network.

<UL><LI>Version 3.5 Is Required.
<LI>Printing on PC/NFS Network.
<LI>Using File Manager on a PC/NFS Network.
<P>
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Version 3.5 Is Required</h3>
 
<P>
You should use version 3.5 or later of the PC/NFS network when
attempting to run it with Windows 3.0.
<P>
<P><h3>Printing on PC/NFS Network</h3>
 
<P>
To print properly from the Sun PC/NFS Network when using Windows, do
the following:

<OL><P><LI>Run the NSFCONF utility and modify the printers you intend to use
   inside Windows to:
<P>
   a. Print after five minutes.
   b. Print in RAW mode.
<P>
   Note: If you are going to print PostScript from inside Windows
   3.0, the NSFCONF utility should be set to PostScript mode instead
   of to RAW mode to accept PostScript code.

<P><LI>Edit the AUTOEXEC.BAT file and change the line
<P>
<P><PRE>      prt *
</PRE><P>
   to:
<P>
<P><PRE>      prt -t30 *
</PRE>
<P><LI>Instead of printing to an LPTx port, select the LPTx.OS2 port under
   Control Panel's Printers option.
<P>
</OL>For more information on printing, query on the following words in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   printing and unsupported and UNIX

</PRE></OL><h3>Using File Manager on PC/NFS Network</h3>
 
<P>
The error "System Error Network Error on Drive &lt;letter&gt;:", where
&lt;letter&gt; is the logical drive letter C to Z, may occur when opening
Windows 3.0 File Manager running in conjunction with a Sun PC-NFS
network. The following solution corrects this problem in most
situations.
<P>
<P><h3>Solution</h3>
 
<P>
Make sure that the network drives are mounted in logical order. For
example, if you have a local drive C, then start your network drive
mountings with logical drive D and continue from there alphabetically.
In the CONFIG.SYS file, modify the line
<P>
<PRE>   DEVICE=PCNFS.SYS

</PRE>as follows
<P>
<PRE>   DEVICE=PCNFS.SYS /dn

</PRE>where n is a number from 1 to 8, based on the number of drives you
have determined will be mounted. Do not include local hard drives in
this number. Because 8 is the maximum simultaneous drive mountings
supported by Sun, this number could be set to 8, and the amount of
error messages received will be this number minus the number of drives
actually mounted.
