<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The purpose of the MIDI Mapper is to provide a way to customize your MIDI
setups to meet the specific needs of your MIDI systems. Some software
products have the ability to bypass the MIDI Mapper. These software
packages allow you to bypass the MIDI Mapper by changing a software
setting.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Cakewalk, for example, can be configured to use the MIDI Mapper or
bypass it. To configure Cakewalk to use the MIDI Mapper, do the
following:

<OL><P><LI>Start Cakewalk for Windows.

<P><LI>From the Settings menu, choose Midi Devices.

<P><LI>Select the MIDI Mapper.
<P>
</OL><h3>Determining If MIDI Mapper Is Being Bypassed</h3>
 
<P>
To determine if the MIDI Mapper is being bypassed by any application:

<OL><P><LI>In the Control Panel window, choose the MIDI Mapper icon.

<P><LI>Choose the Setups command button.

<P><LI>Choose the Edit button.

<P><LI>Clear the Active check box for each of the active ports, except for
   one channel that the MIDI device is capable of accepting. Most devices
   will allow for channel 1 at minimum.

<P><LI>Choose the OK button to save the changes.

<P><LI>Start the Media Player from the Accessories group.

<P><LI>Play a file from the Media Player (CANYON.MID for example). The
   Media Player should play sounds for the one active port only;
   therefore the sound output should be fairly quiet. If the output is
   quiet, the MIDI Mapper is functioning correctly.

<P><LI>Start a third-party application.

<P><LI>Play a file (CANYON.MID for example). If the third-party
   application plays all channels, just as it did before you disabled all
   but one channel, the third-party application is bypassing the MIDI
   Mapper.
<P>
</OL>For information on configuring your third-party application to use the MIDI
Mapper, consult your documentation or contact the third party vendor.
