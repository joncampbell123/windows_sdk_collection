<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Seagate ST-01 and ST-02 SCSI host adapters can be configured to work
with Microsoft Windows; however, you need to resolve the following two
issues to allow these cards to function correctly:

<UL><LI>Excluding ST-01 and ST-02 in the upper memory area (UMA)

<LI>Using ST-02 with an RLL controller
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Excluding ST-01 and ST-02 in UMA</h3>
 
<P>
The Seagate model ST-01 and ST-02 SCSI host adapters use a memory
address space in the upper memory area (UMA) between 640 and 1024K.
This address used is defined by the JP-1 jumper on the card.
<P>
After determining the card's address, exclude it in the SYSTEM.INI
file with an EMMEXCLUDE=xxxx-yyyy in the [386Enh] section, or exclude
it with your UMA provider, such as EMM386.EXE, if you are using one.
<P>
<PRE>Configuration     No UMA Provider          EMM386.EXE in Use
</PRE> 
<P>
No pins
<PRE>connected         EMMEXCLUDE=C800-CBFF     X=C800-CBFF

</PRE>Pins C&amp;D
<PRE>connected         EMMEXCLUDE=CC00-CFFF     X=CC00-CFFF

</PRE>Pins A&amp;B and
<PRE>C&amp;D connected     EMMEXCLUDE=DC00-DFFF     X=DC00-DFFF


</PRE>Using ST-02 With an RLL Controller
 
<P>
If you are using a Seagate ST-02 SCSI controller and a RLL controller
in the same machine, then make sure the RLL is the primary controller
or you can't use the ST-02 to control your floppy drives.
<P>
To make the RLL controller the primary controller, make sure that you
change its ROM address in the UMA to be lower than the SCSI controller's
address. For example, if the RLL controller is at D400, and the ST-02 is
at D000, move the RLL controller to C800.
<P>
This may require changing the SCSI controller address also. Check the
hardware manuals for this information.
