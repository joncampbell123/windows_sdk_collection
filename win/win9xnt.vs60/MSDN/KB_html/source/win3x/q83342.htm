<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If you do not have a COM1 port, you may experience loss of mouse
functionality in the COM2 port when running Microsoft Windows in 386
enhanced mode. The loss of mouse functionality is most likely to occur
when an MS-DOS-based mouse driver is loaded.
<P>
Another similar cause of mouse failure in 386 enhanced mode is
incorrectly configured COM ports. The Logitech virtual mouse driver
(LVMD.386) is hard coded for the standard base port addresses and
interrupt requests (IRQs). The base address for COM1 and COM2 should
be 3F8h and 2F8h, respectively. If the COM addresses are not
configured correctly, or the IRQs are not standard, any Logitech
series mouse will fail to work in 386 enhanced mode.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
One example of a computer that does not have a COM1 port is a system
configured for a fax board on COM1, and the board is subsequently
removed. If the COM1 port is removed, the BIOS searches for serial
ports, and assigns the base address for COM1 (usually 03F8h) to the
first serial port that it finds. If COM1 is missing, the BIOS assigns
the base address for COM1 (03F8) to COM2 (or to the next available COM
port in the machine).
<P>
This problem can be worked around by reinstalling the fax board, or by
changing the interrupt request line (IRQ) as well as the address of
COM3 to COM1. If this change is carried out, it must be reversed when
the fax board is reinstalled.
<P>
<P><h3>Reassigning COM Ports</h3>
 
<P>
To reassign COM3 to COM1:

<OL><P><LI>From Control Panel, choose the Ports icon.

<P><LI>Choose the COM3 port.

<P><LI>Choose the Settings button.

<P><LI>Choose the Advanced button.

<P><LI>Set the base I/O port address to 03F8 (the default for COM1).

<P><LI>Set the IRQ to 4 (the default for COM1).

<P><LI>Choose the OK button to return to the Settings dialog box.

<P><LI>Choose the OK button to return to Control Panel.

<P><LI>Choose the Close button.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: This procedure does not work if you have a device on COM3, unless
your machine is capable of IRQ sharing.
<P>
Reassigning the COM port through the Ports section only works for the
current Windows session. To make this change permanent, you need
to write a debug script for COM port addresses and add a line in the
AUTOEXEC.BAT file. For more information, query on the following here
