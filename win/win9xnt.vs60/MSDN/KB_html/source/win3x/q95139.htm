</PRE><h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
 
<P>
The enclosed WG0670 disk contains the Intel SOFTSET utility, which is
provided by Intel Corporation for use with its EtherExpress(TM) line
of network adapter cards. This utility is used to configure the
network interface card (NIC) and diagnose potential hardware problems.
Microsoft does not provide this utility with Windows for Workgroups
because SOFTSET is not normally required for the proper operation of
Windows for Workgroups.
<P>
<P><h2>THE INTEL ETHEREXPRESS ETHERNET ADAPTERS</h2>
 
<P>
The Intel EtherExpress adapters are software-configurable Ethernet
cards. They contain no hardware jumpers, DIP switches, or other means
for configuring the NIC. EtherExpress holds its settings in an
erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM) chip. These settings
are dynamically adjustable. This means that regardless of the NIC's
settings, you can override the adapter settings by using the software.
<P>
Windows for Workgroups adjusts the settings of the EtherExpress
adapter during the boot of the host machine. For this reason, SOFTSET
is not necessary for configuring EtherExpress with Windows for
Workgroups and consequently is not included with the released product.
<P>
For example, EtherExpress has a default configuration of:
<P>
<PRE>   I/O Base   300h
   IRQ        3
   RAM        None

</PRE>If you select IRQ 5 during Windows for Workgroups setup, this IRQ
setting will override the programmed setting in the EtherExpress
EPROM.
<P>
<PRE>  NOTE: Configuring the EtherExpress adapter with Windows for
  Workgroups will not change the settings on the NIC EPROM. The
  reconfiguration will take effect only after the Windows for
  Workgroups network device drivers have loaded.

</PRE><h2>ETHEREXPRESS ON AN EISA MACHINE</h2>
 
<P>
Extended Industry Standard Architecture (EISA) machines attempt to
determine what type of hardware is installed during their boot
process. Because the EtherExpress adapter is not configured for
Windows for Workgroups until its device drivers load, you can have
EtherExpress installed in an EISA machine and have EtherExpress
conflict with another NIC. While this does not impede the operation of
Windows for Workgroups, the conflict will cause errors during the boot
process of the EISA machine.
<P>
In this situation, using the Intel SOFTSET utility to change the
settings of the EtherExpress adapter will help you bypass boot
difficulties. By running SOFTSET, you can change the conflicting
settings on EtherExpress to cause it to hold different settings at
boot time. Again, this will not interfere with the operation of
Windows for Workgroups.
<P>
<P><h2>RUNNING SOFTSET</h2>
 
<P>
You cannot run SOFTSET if the EtherExpress adapter is in use.
Therefore, no network drivers can be loaded when you run SOFTSET. The
easiest way to configure EtherExpress with SOFTSET is by booting from
a system (bootable) disk. To create a system disk, then boot your
machine from it, and then run SOFTSET, do the following:
<P>
<PRE>    NOTE: Steps 1 and 2 are not necessary if you already have a system
    disk. If you have a system disk, place that disk in drive A and
    skip to step 3.

</PRE><P><LI>Insert a blank floppy disk in drive A.

<P><LI>To create a system disk, type the following at the MS-DOS command
   prompt and press enter:
<P>
<P><PRE>      format a: /s
</PRE>
<P><LI>With the system disk in drive A, reboot your machine.

<P><LI>Place the enclosed WG0670 disk in the appropriate drive.

<P><LI>Change to the drive that contains the WG0670 disk. Type the
   following at the MS-DOS command prompt and press enter:
<P>
<P><PRE>      softset
</PRE><P>
</OL>SOFTSET will present the following options:
<P>
<PRE>  Option         Description
  ------         -----------

  Automatic      When you select this option, SOFTSET will present
  setup          two choices: the BNC and DIX connectors. If you are
                 using one of the Microsoft starter kits, or add
                 ons, you should probably choose BNC. Otherwise, you
                 need to know what type of connector your machine is
                 using to connect to the network.

                    BNC connector = Coaxial cable, RG-58, or thinnet
                    DIX connector = 15-pin connector, RG-11, RG-8,
                    or thicknet

  Manual setup   This option allows knowledgeable users to configure
                 the EtherExpress adapter to values appropriate for
                 their systems. Alterable settings are:

                    I/O address
                    Interrupt
                    Connector type
                    Force 8-bit operation
                    Boot ROM address
                    Amount of RAM to map
                    RAM start address

                 To change a value, use the arrow keys on the
                 keyboard to highlight your selection and press
                 enter.

  Run            There are two forms of diagnostics available under
  diagnostics    this option. Run Diagnostics On Board can be run on
                 any machine containing an EtherExpress adapter. Run
                 Diagnostics On Network and Set Up As Diagnostics
                 Responder require at least two machines connected
                 with the appropriate cabling.

                 Run Diagnostics On Board allows you to test the
                 Ethernet adapter itself for potential defects.

                 Run Diagnostics On Network and Set Up As
                 Diagnostics Responder allow you to test whether the
                 media connecting the two machines that contain
                 EtherExpress adapters is functional. This is
                 particularly useful in configurations where the
                 cabling or connectors are suspect in networking
                 problems. Running these tests from a machine
                 experiencing problems will help locate these
                 problems.

                 To perform this test, do the following steps:

                 1. Select Run Diagnostics On Board to ensure that
                    the Ethernet adapter itself is functioning
                    correctly.

                 2. Install the EtherExpress adapter in two machines.

                 3. Connect the machines with the appropriate
                    cabling.

                 4. Start SOFTSET on both machines.

                 5. On one machine, choose Set Up As Diagnostics
                    Responder.

                 6. After this machine has been set up with this
                    option, choose Run Diagnostics On Network on the
                    second machine.

                   NOTE: If the SOFTSET diagnostics fail, repeat
                   these steps after troubleshooting general network
                   hardware issues.

  View current   This option allows you to view the current settings
  configuration  of the EtherExpress adapter.

  Save           This option allows a LAN administrator to save a
  configuration  configuration to a file for use with other
  to file        EtherExpress adapters.

  Load           Choosing this option allows you to load a
  configuration  configuration previously saved to disk. This can
  from file      also be accomplished from the MS-DOS command line
                 by using the following command

                    softset /load=&lt;filename&gt;

                 where filename is the name of the configuration
                 file you want to load.

  Exit SOFTSET   Choose this option to quit SOFTSET.
