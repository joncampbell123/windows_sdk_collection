The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Novell has versions of IPX.COM and VIPX.386 available through CompuServe.
These files are contained within two separate compressed (PKZIP) files and
are located in the Novell forum.
<P>
If you use one of the new files without the other, Windows halts while
loading and returns an error message indicating that VIPX.386 cannot
load.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following error messages may result if you load Windows in 386 enhanced
mode with mismatched IPX.COM and VIPX.386 files:
<P>
<PRE>   VIPX.386 could not load since a proper version of IPX was not in
   memory. In order to access a NetWare file server from Windows, be
   sure to run the IPX and Shell programs before starting Windows.

</PRE>This error occurs because IPX.COM version 3.1 requires a later version
of VIPX.386. If you receive this error message, either use an older
version of IPX.COM or obtain the latest version of VIPX.386. This file
is dated 11-21-91 and has a file size of 18998 bytes. The file is
located on CompuServe in a file named VIPX.ZIP.
<P>
The following is another error message you may receive:
<P>
<PRE>   VIPX.386 could not load since a proper version of IPX was not in
   memory. Please upgrade your IPX to the most current version. Be sure
   to load IPX before starting Windows.

</PRE>This error occurs if you have not upgraded IPX.COM to version 3.1. If
you receive this error message, do one of the following:

<UL><LI>Use an earlier version of VIPX.386, such as the version that ships
   with Microsoft Windows version 3.0 or the Microsoft Windows 3.0
   Supplemental Driver Library (SDL).
<P>
</UL>-or-

<UL><LI>From CompuServe, download version 3.1 of IPX and regenerate the
   shell. This version is contained in a file called DOSUP4.ZIP.
<P>
</UL>These workstation files are available in the Novell forum on
CompuServe. Customers should log onto CompuServe, and type the
following at the ! prompt:
<P>
<PRE>   GO Novell
