The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.1, 3.11
<LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When a Setup error message contains an error code, it also includes
some text indicating what Setup was trying to do, for example, copying
a file. The text of the error message indicates whether the error is
fatal or not. In some nonfatal cases, Setup may be performing an
operation (such as copying a file) that is needed to run Windows.
Other times the error may prevent some specific feature of Windows
from operating properly.
<P>
In many cases, the error code is an MS-DOS extended error code. These
error codes are between 0 and 100. Setup-specific error codes have two
different formats, depending on whether the error occurs during the
character (MS-DOS) mode or Windows graphical user interface (GUI) mode
portion of Setup. The character mode Setup specific error numbers are
in the format "Snnn", where "nnn" is any three digits. The GUI mode
error numbers are codes greater than 200.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In both character and GUI modes, the following MS-DOS error codes may
be reported:
<P>
02   File not found - possible corrupt disks.
<P>
03   Path not found - possible hardware problem or incompatible
<PRE>     software (virus?).

</PRE>04   Too many open files - should never occur. May occur in
<PRE>     maintenance mode Setup if WIN.COM, WIN.CNF, or another
     component is crosslinked with another file.

</PRE>05   Access denied - make sure the file is not write protected or
<PRE>     protected by virus protection software.

</PRE>06   Handle invalid - serious problem, unknown.
<P>
07   Memory control blocks destroyed  - serious problem, unknown.
<P>
08   Insufficient memory - free up memory and run Setup again. May
<PRE>     also occur if very long or corrupt SYSTEM.INI, WIN.INI or
     SETUP.INF files exist.

</PRE>09   Memory block address invalid  - serious problem, unknown.
<P>

<P>
21   Drive not ready  - should never occur (different error message).
<P>
22   Unknown command  - serious problem, unknown.
<P>
23   Data error (CRC) - possible corrupt disks.
<P>
24   Bad request-structure length  - serious problem, unknown.
<P>
25   Seek error - possible corrupt disks.
<P>
26   Unknown media type - possible corrupt disks.
<P>
27   Sector not found - possible corrupt disks.
<P>
28   Write fault - possible corrupt disks.
<P>
30   Read fault - possible corrupt disks.
<P>
31   General failure - possible corrupt disks.
<P>
32   Sharing violation - should never occur (different error message).
<P>

<P>
When setting up to or from a network, the following MS-DOS error codes
can occur:
<P>
50   Unsupported network request - serious problem, unknown.
<P>
51   Remote machine not listening - serious problem, unknown.
<P>
52   Duplicate name on network - serious problem, unknown.
<P>
53   Network name not found - serious problem, unknown.
<P>
54   Network busy - retry operation.
<P>
55   Device no longer exists on network - check with network
<PRE>     administrator.

</PRE>56   NetBIOS command limit exceeded  - check with network
<PRE>     administrator.

</PRE>57   Error in network adapter hardware - check with network
<PRE>     administrator.

</PRE>58   Incorrect response from network  - check with network
<PRE>     administrator.

</PRE>59   Unexpected network error  - check with network administrator.
<P>
60   Remote adapter incompatible - serious problem, unknown.
<P>
64   Network name deleted - serious problem, unknown.
<P>
65   Network access denied  - check with network administrator.
<P>
66   Incorrect network device type - serious problem, unknown.
<P>
67   Network name not found - serious problem, unknown.
<P>
68   Network name limit exceeded  - check with network administrator.
<P>
69   NetBIOS session limit exceeded  - check with network
<PRE>     administrator.

</PRE>70   Temporary pause in file sharing - check with network
<PRE>     administrator.

</PRE>71   Network request not accepted  - check with network administrator.
<P>
72   Print or disk redirection paused - serious problem, unknown.
<P>
80   File already exists  - serious problem, unknown. Setup will use
<PRE>     MS-DOS to make sure it can write over existing files.

</PRE>82   Cannot make directory - check with network administrator.
<P>
83   Fail on Int 24H (critical error) - some drivers will fail an
<PRE>     access when an error occurs without issuing an Int 24H (which
     causes Setup to display an error message allowing you to
     retry the operation rather than just failing it). The cause of
     the error is bad disks or network problems. Some viruses and
     virus-protection software can cause this error to occur.

</PRE>84   Too many redirections - serious problem, unknown.
<P>
85   Duplicate redirection - serious problem, unknown.
<P>
86   Invalid password - check with network administrator.
<P>
87   Invalid parameter - serious problem, unknown.
<P>
88   Net write fault - check with network administrator.
