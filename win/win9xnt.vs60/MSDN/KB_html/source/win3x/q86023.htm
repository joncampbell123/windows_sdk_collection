<P>
<P><h3>Description of .CPL Files</h3>
 
<P>
You can add additional icons and functionality to the Control Panel in
Windows 3.1 and Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1 and 3.11 by adding
"installable" .CPL files. These .CPL files must be located in the
Windows SYSTEM directory or the corresponding icon does not appear in
the Control Panel. However multimedia .CPL files can be referenced in
another directory by specifying a new path in the [MMCPL] section of
the CONTROL.INI file.
<P>
You should design and structure the .CPL file to conform to the
CPLINFO specification as outlined in the Microsoft Windows
Programmer's reference. Simply attaching a .CPL extension to a file of
unspecified format doesn't work. The CPLINFO specification contains
information concerning the icon, application or device name,
identification numbers, and other data.
<P>
NOTE: If VER.DLL is missing from the WINDOWS or Windows SYSTEM
directory, only the 386 Enhanced icon and the Sound icon appear in
Control Panel.
<P>
<P><h3>Replacement of Control Panel Icons</h3>
 
<P>
When you run the Control Panel in Windows 3.1 or Windows for
Workgroups (WFWG), some of the icons may not display if the
corresponding .CPL file is corrupt or missing. To correct this
problem, you must expand the files from the Windows disks back to the
Windows SYSTEM directory. Note that the network icon does not display
if the network is not properly installed. This is not a problem with
the MAIN.CPL, but with the network installation.
<P>
Use the following steps to add a missing Control Panel icon:

<OL><P><LI>Exit Windows.

<P><LI>Copy EXPAND.EXE from your Windows or WFWG disk to your WINDOWS
   directory.
<P>
   NOTE: EXPAND.EXE is located on Windows 3.1 disk 3 (both disk sizes),
   on WFWG 3.1 disk 8 (5.25) or disk 6 (3.5), and on WFWG 3.11 disk 6
   (both disk sizes).

<P><LI>Put the Windows disk with the correct *.CP_ file in your floppy
   disk drive. Depending on the Windows version and disk size you have,
   *.CPL files are located on the following  disks:
<P>

   initializes).

                                                many system events

</PRE></OL>NOTE: The Windows Driver Library disks include an additional .CPL
file, SBPMIXER.CPL (file size 25792, dated 2/1/92), for computers with
Creative Labs Sound Blaster Pro sound cards. This icon is an
audio-mixing board for the Sound Blaster Pro.
<P>
<P><h3>"Cannot Find Control Panel Components" Error Message</h3>
 
<P>
The Windows 3.1 or Windows for Workgroups 3.1 and 3.11 Control Panel
(CONTROL.EXE) may return the following message upon execution:
<P>
<PRE>   Cannot find the Control Panel components (files
   with .CPL extension).

   Verify that they are installed in your Windows
   SYSTEM directory.
   &lt;OK&gt;

</PRE>This error usually occurs when the .CPL files cannot be found in the
SYSTEM directory, or if the files have become corrupt. First, you
should confirm existence of the following .CPL files in your Windows
SYSTEM directory:
<P>
<PRE>   CPWIN386.CPL
   DRIVERS.CPL
   MAIN.CPL
   SND.CPL
   WFWSETUP.CPL  &lt;=== Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 only.

</PRE>If any file is missing, you need to expand it from your Windows disks.
If all files are there, then it is possible that the files are
corrupted. In this case you should exit Windows, delete all of the
SYSTEM\*.CPL files, then expand each .CPL from your Microsoft Windows
disks into your Windows SYSTEM subdirectory, as described in this
article.
<P>
<P><h3>Using a .CPL File Icon Elsewhere</h3>
 
<P>
The Windows version 3.1 Control Panel contains only one icon embedded
in the executable file CONTROL.EXE. If an embedded icon from the
Windows 3.0 CONTROL.EXE file is used as a replacement icon for a
program item, a similar Windows 3.1 icon may be located in one of the
Control Panel data files (*.CPL).
<P>
Because of the modular structure of the Windows 3.1 Control Panel,
most icons that were embedded in earlier versions of the CONTROL.EXE
file have been moved to different associated data files located in the
SYSTEM subdirectory. These files include CPWIN386.CPL, DRIVERS.CPL,
MAIN.CPL, and SND.CPL. To use one of the icons placed in the .CPL
files for a program item in Windows 3.1, use the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>In Program Manager, select the program item whose icon needs to
   be changed.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Properties to open the Program Item
   Properties dialog box.

<P><LI>Choose the Change Icon button.

<P><LI>Type the appropriate .CPL filename in the File Name box, then
   choose the OK button.
<P>
</OL><h3>Multimedia Settings in the CONTROL.INI</h3>
 
<P>
The [MMCPL] section of the CONTROL.INI file contains information which
concerns the size and placement of the Control Panel window, the
number of iconized applications in the Control Panel, and a path
setting for multimedia .CPL files residing outside of the Windows
SYSTEM subdirectory. The settings include:
<P>
<PRE>   Setting                 Description
   --------------------------------------------------------
   x=&lt;number&gt;              Horizontal window coordinate

   y=&lt;number&gt;              Vertical window coordinate

   h=&lt;number&gt;              Height in pixels

   w=&lt;number&gt;              Width in pixels

   numapps=&lt;number&gt;        The number of applications in the
                          Control Panel

</PRE></OL>In addition Microsoft Windows for Pen Computing may add the following
lines to the [MMCPL] file:
<P>
<PRE>   cppen=c:\windows\cppen.cpl
   cphw=c:\windows\cphw.cpl
   cprot=c:\windows\cprot.cpl
   cpcal=c:\windows\cpcal.cpl

</PRE>These entries allow the Control Panel to find .CPL file in
subdirectories other than the Windows SYSTEM subdirectory.
<P>
<P><h3>GP Faults in Control Panel</h3>
 
<P>
If you experience general protection (GP) faults when opening Control
Panel, it is likely that one of the .CPL files is corrupted or
damaged. Please follow the instructions in the previous section of
this article to replace the icon.
<P>
<P><h3>Missing Control Panel Icons</h3>
 
<P>
If KRNL386.EXE is in the Windows directory instead of, or in addition to,
the Windows\SYSTEM subdirectory, one or more of the Control Panel icons
may not appear. KRNL386.EXE should be in only the Windows\SYSTEM
subdirectory.
