The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Windows 3.0 Setup program does not automatically install the
appropriate fonts when a dot-matrix printer is chosen.
<P>
If the proper font set is not installed, you will receive low-quality
print output when using these fonts (that is, Helvetica, Times Roman,
or Courier) in applications for Windows.
<P>
To work around this problem, install the proper font set manually by
using the Control Panel Fonts section.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Fonts for 9-Pin Dot-Matrix Printers</h3>
 
<P>
Most 9-pin dot-matrix printers use a resolution of 120 x 72 dots per
inch (dpi). For this resolution, install the "D" font set. This set
includes HELVD.FON, TMSD.FON, and COURD.FON. For font installation
instructions, see the "Microsoft Windows User's Guide" version 3.0
manual. Once installed, the fonts should appear in the Control Panel
Fonts section as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   Helv 8,10,12,14,18,24 (120 dpi)
   Courier 10,12,15 (120 dpi)
   Tms Rmn 8,10,12,14,18,24 (120 dpi)

</PRE>If you want to print in the much lower 60 x 72 dpi resolution that is
optional on some 9-pin printers, you may want to install the "C" font
set as well.
<P>
<P><h3>Fonts for 24-Pin Dot Matrix Printers</h3>
 
<P>
24-pin dot-matrix printers normally print at 180 x 180 dpi resolution,
which is a 1:1 aspect ratio -- the same as a VGA or 8514/A display.
This means that 24-pin dot-matrix printers print using the VGA or
8514/A font sets (sets "E" and "F" respectively).
<P>
Since the VGA font set is designed for a 96 dpi resolution, it will
give fonts at approximately half the stated size for a 180 x 180 dpi
dot-matrix printer. Similarly, the 8514/A fonts are designed for a 120
dpi resolution, and will print at 2/3 the stated size at 180 x 180
dpi. If the 24-pin printer resolution is raised to 360 x 360, VGA
fonts will print at 1/4 size, and 8514/A fonts at 1/3 size.
<P>
If you change the 24-pin dot-matrix resolution to an aspect ratio that
is not 1:1 (for example, 360 x 180 dpi), you will not achieve
satisfactory output using nonprinter fonts from Windows.
<P>
<P><h3>24-Pin Dot Matrix with VGA or 8514/A Displays</h3>
 
<P>
If you have a VGA display and a 24-pin dot-matrix printer, the proper
font set is already installed. However, you may want to also install
the 8514/A font set, which will give you some additional font sizes.
Likewise, if you have an 8514/A, you may want to install the VGA font
set.
<P>
<P><h3>24-Pin Dot-Matrix Printers with EGA/Hercules or Other Displays</h3>
 
<P>
If you have an EGA, Hercules, or other display type, and a 24-pin
dot-matrix printer, you will get low-quality output using nonprinter
fonts (that is, Helvetica, Times Roman, or Courier) if the proper font
set is not installed. You should install at least the VGA font set
(set "E") for proper output. You may also want to install the 8514/A
font set (set "F") as discussed in the section above.
<P>
<P><h3>Installation Procedure</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start Control Panel from the Main group in Program Manager.

<P><LI>Choose the Fonts icon.

<P><LI>Choose the Add button.

<P><LI>Insert Disk 4 (5.25-inch disks) or Disk 5 or 6 (3.5-inch disks) in
   drive A.

<P><LI>When prompted for the font filename, enter "A:*.FON" (without the
   quotation marks).

<P><LI>Look for the following filenames in the font files displayed:
<P>
<P><PRE>      COURD.FON
      TMSRD.FON
</PRE>
<P><LI>Select the appropriate font file and choose the OK button.
<P>
</OL><h3>Additional Information</h3>
 
<P>
Under Windows versions 2.0, 2.03, 2.1, and 2.11, if you select a 9-pin
dot-matrix printer when installing Windows, Setup automatically
installs the proper font set. This allows you to produce high-quality
print output using the Windows Helvetica, Times Roman, and Courier
fonts.
<P>
This change of behavior in Windows version 3.0 is by design for two
reasons. First, the use of 9-pin dot-matrix printers has considerably
declined since Windows versions 2.0, 2.03, 2.1, and 2.11 were
produced. Second, the exclusion of such a feature was necessary to
complete the development of the Windows 3.0 Control Panel in time to
ship the product.
