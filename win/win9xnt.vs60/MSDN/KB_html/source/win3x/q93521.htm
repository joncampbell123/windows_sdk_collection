<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Parity error messages are caused by the generation of nonmaskable
interrupts (NMIs). A clean, uncorrupt installation of Windows cannot
generate an NMI, therefore it is not possible for a clean, uncorrupt
installation of Windows to cause a parity error.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Parity is a very basic check of information integrity. Each byte (8 bits)
of RAM storage actually takes nine bits of information. Eight bits are used
for the data and the last bit (the "parity bit") is used to store the
parity of the data.
<P>
The processor is in charge of checking the accuracy of the parity bit, and
the processor generates an NMI if it determines that the parity bit is set
incorrectly. In Windows 386 enhanced mode, this is captured by a Virtual
Device Driver (VDD), *parity, which displays an error message. In Windows
Standard Mode, NMIs are ignored and passed to the default parity handler.
This either does nothing or generates a TTY (full screen) error message. In
both cases, the machine is in an unstable state and is halted.
<P>
Parity errors can seem to be resolved if you remove a memory-resident item,
such as a device driver or terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) program. This
only changes the memory location of load code. If you change the location
or remove an item, then the code no longer resides on the faulty memory and
you may no longer receive a parity error. If data resides the suspect
memory, you might not see a parity error at all. Unfortunately, since data
and code in Windows changes memory locations constantly, the parity error
might appear (or reappear) later.
<P>
In Windows, memory is commonly allocated with a flag to initialize the
memory to zero. This makes the parity even (zero ones set in the data
byte). If there is a faulty memory chip where the value of a bit is always
set to zero, then everything functions normally as nothing is written to
that memory (because the parity bit is correct). If the faulty memory
address falls in a code segment (that is, the memory is going to store
actual, executable code) it is likely that the bit will be used and a
parity error will be generated.
<P>
A parity error can be caused by different circumstances but it is almost
always a hardware problem.
<P>
<P><h3>Common Causes of Parity Errors</h3>
 
<P>
One cause of parity errors is faulty memory. The most foolproof way to
resolve this problem is to swap out each piece of memory until the problem
disappears. Make sure you are using good, quality memory and the memory is
properly seated in the computer. Memory checking programs are not adequate
because they don't test the memory the way that Windows uses it. Most, if
not all, memory checkers use read/write cycles when scanning memory. Since
Windows is executing code from the memory, it uses execute cycles. Execute
cycles are physically different from read/write cycles and are more
vulnerable to parity errors. It is possible for memory checking programs to
find parity errors if the memory is extremely faulty.
<P>
Sometimes parity errors are caused by mismatched memory speeds. The CPU
might be accessing the memory faster than the memory is capable of handling
requests. A possible workaround is to increase the number of wait states in
the CMOS setup. This option is not available on all machines and doesn't
always work. In short, increasing the number of wait states directs the CPU
to wait for a predetermined amount of time between memory reads. This slows
the machine down because it now takes longer to access memory. Generally,
this option can be set to Zero, One, or Two wait states. The higher the
number, the longer it waits between memory cycles. In addition, try to keep
the same speed of RAM installed in your computer. If you have to mix
speeds, make sure that you have the same speed RAM installed in each Bank.
Banks are usually sets of four memory chips on the motherboard.
<P>
Supporting hardware, like video cards, can often cause parity errors.
Because the devices occupy memory in the UMB, read/write data to these
devices can also cause parity errors. The best way test this is to replace
the device with one that is working correctly. Also faulty power supplies
can cause parity errors.
<P>
Another known cause for parity errors is the PARITY BOOT B Virus.
<P>
<P><h3>What is Parity?</h3>
 
<P>
There are two versions of Parity: Odd and Even. The Parity BIT is set on
or off depending on the count of ON bits, or 1's, in the data, usually a
byte.
<P>
<P><h3>Examples</h3>
 
<P>
11011010 (Parity would be set to 1 to make the number of ones even.)
<P>
11110111 (Parity would be set to 0 to make the number of ones odd.)
<P>
Memory for the PC is designed such that there is an extra chip, or extra
BIT, set aside for parity. This chip will hold the parity for a byte of
memory. This is why there is often 9 chips on a memory SIMM, or the chips
themselves are labeled 256x9's or 1Megx9's, and so on.
<P>
A parity error will be generated when a piece of code is executed in a
faulty memory address. During the fetch or pre-fetch cycle of the CPU, the
point where the CPU receives an instruction from memory to execute, the
hardware checks the fetched code for parity. If that fetch fails, an
exception error is generated. This is done to safe-guard the CPU from
executing an instruction that is not viable.
<P>
During a regular memory fetch, that is, data reads, parity is not checked.
This is why a memory checker will normally be unable to find parity errors.
The only program that will check memory for parity problems correctly is a
program that executes code in the RAM addresses in question. Windows 3.0
and 3.1 are such programs. In Windows 3.0, the mechanism for checking
parity errors did not function correctly and instead generated UAE's. These
UAE's were a result of the parity errors not being caught and the code
continuing to run in the faulty memory.
<P>
NOTE: You cannot check memory for parity problems by creating a RAMDRIVE,
copying a program to it, and executing the program. The program is still
stored as data in the RAMDRIVE. When run, the program is copied into
conventional memory before it is executed. For information on how to use a
RAMDRIVE to troubleshoot memory, please see the following article(s) in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
