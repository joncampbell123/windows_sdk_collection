The information in this article applies to:

<LI>Microsoft Word for MS-DOS, version 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
There are several ways to transport graphics from Microsoft Windows to
Microsoft Word for MS-DOS, version 5.0. This article outlines the
procedures for these methods.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Clipboard</h3>
 
<P>
Using the Clipboard is the quickest and most direct way to import a
graphic to Word 5.0. The procedure is as follows:

<OL><P><LI>Copy the graphic to the Windows Clipboard in bitmap form. You can
   check to see if it is a bitmap by loading CLIPBRD.EXE from Windows.
   From Excel, you can put a bitmap on the Clipboard by holding down
   the SHIFT key, choosing Edit Copy Picture, selecting As Shown On
   Screen, and pressing SHIFT+ENTER.

<P><LI>Run Word 5.0 under Windows. If necessary, close all Windows
   applications to free memory, but do not close Windows itself. The
   Clipboard will retain the image as long as Windows is running.

<P><LI>In Word, choose Library Link Graphic and choose Clipboard (the
   keystroke sequence is ESC L L G F1 ENTER).

<P><LI>To verify that the graphic was successfully linked, choose Print
   Preview (the keystroke sequence is ESC P V). If the graphic appears
   in the preview, it has been successfully linked.
<P>
</OL>If either of the following occurs, you must resize the image to make
it smaller:

<OL><P><LI>Word reports the following error immediately after linking the
   graphic:
<P>
<P><PRE>      No bitmap found in Clipboard
</PRE>
<P><LI>Word reports the following error when in Print Preview:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Cannot link graphic UNTITLED.P00. Word is unable to process
      information in file.
</PRE><P>
</OL>If you do not want to make the graphic smaller, you can use one of the
methods listed below.
<P>
<P><h3>PCX Format</h3>
 
<P>
Copy the graphic into PC Paintbrush Plus as a bitmap for Windows and
save the file in PCX format. This method will retain the color of the
image.
<P>
<P><h3>HPGL Format</h3>
 
<P>
The following method is best used when memory is short. It retains the
colors of the picture. If you do not know how to print to a file from
Windows, see "Printing to a file" below. To create an HPGL file, do
the following:

<OL><P><LI>Add a filename followed by an equal sign to the [ports] section of
    the WIN.INI.

<P><LI>Exit and restart Windows.

<P><LI>Run the Windows Control Panel.

<P><LI>Select Setup Connections.

<P><LI>Connect the HP plotter to the filename and select OK.

<P><LI>Choose Setup Printer.

<P><LI>Make sure that HPPLOT on &lt;&lt;filename&gt;&gt; is selected and press ENTER.

<P><LI>From the Devices menu in the HP plotter driver, select the ColorPro
    7440a.

<P><LI>Select "preloaded" and change orientation to landscape.

<P><LI>Press ENTER and close the Control Panel.

<P><LI>Print the graphic from the Windows application.

<P><LI>Start Word (either inside Windows or from DOS) and choose Library
    Link Graphics.

<P><LI>Type the name of your print file.

<P><LI>Type HPGL under File Format.

<P><LI>Choose Print Preview to view the linked graphic.
<P>
</OL><h3>PostScript or Printer File</h3>
 
<P>
The PostScript or printer file method also works well when memory is
low. The main disadvantages are the following:

<OL><P><LI>Word must be installed for the same type of printer as Windows.

<P><LI>The graphic does not show in Page Preview. Word does, however,
   reserve space in the document for the picture, and the graphic will
   print properly.
<P>
</OL>To create a printer or PostScript file, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Print to a file with the appropriate driver from Windows.

<P><LI>Start Word.

<P><LI>Link the graphic with the keystrokes ESC L L G.

<P><LI>Type the name of the print file.

<P><LI>Under File Format, type printer or PostScript.
<P>
</OL>To print to a file from Windows, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Locate the line "Spooler=yes". It should be near the top of the
   file. Change the line to read "Spooler=no". This statement turns
   off the Windows print spooler.

<P><LI>Locate the [ports] section of the WIN.INI file. This section is
   usually about one-half to three-quarters of the way through the
   file.

<P><LI>In the [ports] section, add the line "C:\OUTPUT.PRN=" (without the
   quotation marks).

<P><LI>Save the modified WIN.INI. If you did this editing from within
   Windows, quit and restart Windows to put the modifications into
   effect.

<P><LI>Run the Control Panel and choose Connections from the Setup menu.

<P><LI>Connect the printer to the port C:\OUTPUT.PRN.

<P><LI>Close the Control Panel and print your document. With this method,
   the document prints to a file called OUTPUT.PRN; the printer is not
   involved. OUTPUT.PRN will be located in C:\ or whichever drive you
   specified.

<P><LI>When the application prints its output to the file and disk
   activity ceases, the print file is completed.
