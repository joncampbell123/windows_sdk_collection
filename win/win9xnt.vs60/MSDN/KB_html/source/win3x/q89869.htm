The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.1, 3.11

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If more than one version of the Sound Blaster Pro virtual device driver is
listed in the SYSTEM.INI file's [386ENH] section, the sound card may
continue to play the System Exit sound in MS-DOS after you have exited
Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Creative Labs Sound Blaster Pro is an audio card capable of playing both
wave and MIDI files. In the more recent release of the Soundblaster Pro,
the filename for the virtual device driver has been changed. When the old
line in the SYSTEM.INI file for the virtual device driver is not removed
during the installation of the new driver, two or more virtual device
drivers are loaded.
<P>
This causes the sound card to continue to play the System Exit sound even
after Windows is no longer running. It may be necessary to restart the
computer to stop the sound. Check the SYSTEM.INI file's [386ENH] section
for the following entries:
<P>
<PRE>   DEVICE=VSBD.386
   DEVICE=VADLIBD.386
   DEVICE=VSBPD.386

</PRE><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
If one or both of the first two device lines are present, remove the
first lines, leaving only:
<P>
<PRE>   DEVICE=VSBPD.386

</PRE>Sound Blaster Pro is manufactured by Creative Labs, a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this
product's performance or reliability.
