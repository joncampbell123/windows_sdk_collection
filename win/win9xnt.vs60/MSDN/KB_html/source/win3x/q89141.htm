The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11
</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article discusses the use of Microsoft Windows and swap files on
network drives. The following topics are included:

<UL><LI>Can swap files be created on a network drive?
<LI>Why does Windows take so long to start in 386 enhanced mode?
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Can Swap Files be Created on a Network Drive?</h3>
 
<P>
Network drives do not support the INT13h calls needed to set up a permanent
swap file. A temporary swap file can be set up on a network drive where you
have full privileges (rights) including creation rights if you are on a
Novell network.
<P>
Approximately 2 MB of free hard disk space is required. You cannot have
multiple workstations using the same swap file; therefore, if you set up a
swap file on a network drive, it should be in the user's directory where no
one else but the user can access it.
<P>
If possible, set up the swap file on your local workstation's hard drive.
Benefits of this configuration include the following:

<UL><LI>Performance for the workstation
<LI>Performance for the network (cuts down on network traffic)
<LI>Provides the ability to set up a permanent swap file
<P>
</UL><h3>Why Does Windows Take So Long to Start in 386 Enhanced Mode?</h3>
 
<P>
Temporary swap files on a network can make the loading of Windows slow.
This can also affect the speed at which Windows runs in 386 enhanced mode
while Windows tries to swap files. This affects both Windows and non-
Windows-based applications.
<P>
When you load Windows, the temporary swap file is initialized in the
startup location of WIN.COM. Because a network drive normally has a large
amount of free disk space, this swap file can become large. 386 enhanced
mode initializes the temporary swap file to about half of the available
contiguous free disk space.
<P>
Initializing this large swap file can take a long time and can cause
Windows to take more than one minute to load.
<P>
There are three ways to avoid this problem:

<OL><P><LI>The first step is to change the location of the temporary swap
   file. Change the PagingDrive= in the [386Enh] section of the
   SYSTEM.INI file to a local drive. For example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      PagingDrive=C:
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: For a diskless workstation, this won't be an option. A
   network drive must be used.

<P><LI>You can also limit the size of the swap file by using the
   MaxPagingFileSize= statement in the [386Enh] section of the
   SYSTEM.INI. For example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      MaxPagingFileSize=[Amount in Kilobytes]
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: Using a smaller size swap file speeds up the initialization
   of the swap file and makes access to it faster as well. This also
   limits the amount of virtual memory available.

<P><LI>Using Notepad, you can disable paging completely by editing the
   Paging= line in the [386Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file.
<P>
<P><PRE>      Paging=NO
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: Microsoft does not recommend setting Paging=NO as a Long-term
   solution because this may adversely affect the performance of Windows.
