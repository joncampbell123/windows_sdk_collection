The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The following information was taken from the Microsoft Windows for
Workgroups version 3.11 NETWORKS.WRI file.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
2.2 More Information about Using Novell NetWare with Windows for
Workgroups 3.11

<UL><LI>When you set up NetWare support in Windows for Workgroups, the
   value of the lastdrive command in your CONFIG.SYS file is set to P.
   When you restart your computer, your login directory is drive Q. If
   you have any NetWare login scripts, make sure they reference the
   correct drive letter for your login directory.
<P>
   When the lastdrive command is set to P, you can use letters from A to
   P to connect to other Windows for Workgroups computers or Windows NT
   or Microsoft LAN Manager servers. Letters after P are reserved for
   connecting to Novell NetWare servers.

<LI>Do not try to log in, log out, attach, or detach a Novell server
   from MS-DOS Prompt within Windows. You should log in before you start
   Windows for Workgroups, and attach or detach servers by using File
   Manager or Print Manager.

<LI>When you set up NetWare support in Windows for Workgroups for
   IPXODI.COM and LSL.COM, Setup adds the odihlp command to your
   AUTOEXEC.BAT file. It inserts it on the line following the ipxodi
   command. Do not change the order of these lines.

<LI>If you are using a token-ring network and the driver on your Novell
   server does not support source routing (for example, IBM token-ring
   drivers earlier than version 2.4), remove the ROUTE.COM statement
   from your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

<LI>If you have problems connecting to a Novell server, make sure the
   Adapter Media Type setting in Network Setup matches your Novell
   NetWare software configuration. For more information, see Appendix C,
   "Troubleshooting," in The Microsoft Workgroup Add-On "User's Guide."

<LI>By default, NetWare allows you access to only 40 files at a time.
   When you are running applications with Windows, you can exceed this
   limit rather quickly. If you do, you might see unexpected error
   messages. To increase the file access limit, add the following line
   to the beginning of your NET.CFG file:
<P>
<P><PRE>      file handles=60
</PRE><P>
   You should also add the following to your CONFIG.SYS file:
<P>
<P><PRE>      files=60
</PRE>
<LI>If you get unusable output (such as incorrect fonts, garbled text,
   invalid page breaks, or blank lines) when you try to print to a
   NetWare server, you may need to edit your print-job configuration.
   Try using the NetWare PRINTCON utility to set the Auto Endcap and
   Enable Timeout options to No.

<LI>Swapping to a drive on a NetWare 286 server might make starting
   Windows for Workgroups take up to a minute. For information about
   controlling the location of your swap file, see Chapter 11, "Managing
   Memory and Performance," in the Microsoft Windows for Workgroups
   "User's Guide."

<LI>A NetWare file server does not include the directory entries dot
   (.) and double dot (..) as MS-DOS does. However, the NetWare shell
   (version 3.01 or later) can emulate these entries when applications
   attempt to list the files in a directory. If you have problems
   listing files or deleting directories, turn on the Show Dots feature.
   To do this, add the following line to the beginning of your NET.CFG
   file:
<P>
<P><PRE>      show dots=on
</PRE><P>
   Turning on Show Dots will cause problems with earlier versions of
   some 80286-based NetWare utilities, such as BINDFIX.EXE and
   MAKEUSER.EXE. Make sure you upgrade these utilities if you upgrade
   your NetWare shell. For more information, contact your Novell dealer.

<LI>Redirected drives can look different in Windows for Workgroups than
   without Windows for Workgroups. For example, a device mapped as
   FileServerName/Volume:Directory will appear in Windows as
   FileServerName/Volume:\, showing the root of the file server's shared
   volume rather than the subdirectory. You can correct this with the
   MAP ROOT entry, as explained in the following information.

<LI>In some cases, Windows-based applications may change the default
   directory on a drive. This might cause problems if, for example, your
   path includes the current directory on a network drive (that is, your
   path includes a drive letter without a specific directory, such as z:
   instead of z:\system).
<P>
   You can prevent this problem by using MAP.EXE and LOGIN.EXE versions
   3.0 and later to set up false roots, or by choosing the MAP ROOT
   function when you are mapping a connection in File Manager. This
   feature simulates the MS-DOS subst command, which sets the root of a
   given drive to a directory designated by the user instead of to the
   true root of the volume.
<P>
   For example, suppose you normally mapped drive F to the HOME\TERRI
   directory on the SERVER\SYS volume, and then included F: in your
   path. You would do this by including the following command in your
   AUTOEXEC.BAT file or by typing the command before you start Windows:
<P>
<P><PRE>      map f:=server\sys:home\terri
</PRE><P>
   The default directory on drive F would then be HOME\TERRI. To prevent
   Windows from changing this, you would replace that command with the
   following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      map root f:=server\sys:home\terri
</PRE><P>
   This command would make the directory HOME\TERRI appear to be the
   root of drive F.

<LI>You can adjust the way Windows handles your network drive mappings
   by using the Network option in Control Panel.
<P>
   Usually, when you quit Windows for Workgroups, all of your drive
   mappings are restored to the way they were before you started Windows
   for Workgroups, and all changes you made while running Windows are
   lost. If you clear the Restore Drives option in the settings dialog
   box for NetWare, the mappings you made in Windows for Workgroups will
   remain when you quit.
<P>
   Typically, each instance of MS-DOS Prompt you start from Windows for
   Workgroups has its own set of drive mappings. Changes you make in one
   instance do not affect another. If you set the NWShareHandles option,
   drive mappings will instead be global, and changes to the mappings or
   the current drive made in one instance of MS-DOS Prompt will affect
   all other applications. If you are running a NetWare 286 server,
   setting NWShareHandles increases the number of workstations that can
   be connected to the server before the server runs out of available
   connections.
<P>
   See the Help available in the Network dialog box in Control Panel for
   more information on these options.

<LI>If you have applications or files that use extended characters
   (ASCII characters above 128) and you have problems viewing or using
   them, try adding the following line to your NET.CFG file:
<P>
<P><PRE>      special uppercase = on
</PRE>
<LI>When you connect or disconnect network resources from File Manager,
   Print Manager, or Control Panel, pay attention to the state of the
   Permanent check box. If this option is selected when you make a
   connection, the connection is automatically made each time you
   restart Windows for Workgroups. To stop reconnecting, disconnect from
   the network resource with the Permanent check box selected. If the
   option is not selected when you disconnect, the connection is removed
   for the current Windows session but is reconnected when you restart
   Windows for Workgroups.

<LI>If you were running Novell NetBIOS before you set up Windows for
   Workgroups, the Setup program attempts to remove it. We do not
   recommend using the Novell NetBIOS protocol. Instead, use the IPX/SPX
   protocol that is compatible with NetBIOS.
<P>
   To install the IPX/SPX protocol that is compatible with NetBIOS:
<P>
   1. In the Networks group, choose the Network Setup icon.
<P>
   2. In the Network Setup dialog box, choose the Drivers button. The
<P><PRE>      Network Drivers dialog box appears.
</PRE><P>
   3. Choose the Add Protocol button. The Add Network Protocol dialog
<P><PRE>      box appears.
</PRE><P>
   4. Choose "IPX/SPX Compatible Transport with NetBIOS"  from the drop
<P><PRE>      down list box. Then choose OK.
</PRE><P>

2.3.5 MSIPX support
Although we recommend that you upgrade from the MSIPX protocol to
either the IPXODI or IPX/SPX protocol, you can keep your MSIPX
support. This section describes the changes that are made to your
system files if you choose to keep MSIPX support when you upgrade
from Windows for Workgroups 3.1 to Windows for Workgroups 3.11.
<P>
The following lines are removed from CONFIG.SYS:
<P>
C:\WINDOWS\PROTMAN.DOS /I:C:\WINDOWS
C:\WINDOWS\WORKGRP.SYS
C:\WINDOWS\&lt;NDIS MAC driver&gt;.DOS
C:\WINDOWS\MSIPX.SYS
<P>
<PRE>        The above lines are replaced by:

</PRE>DEVICE=C:\WINDOWS\IFSHLP.SYS
<P>
The following is an example of a typical AUTOEXEC.BAT file once you
have upgraded to Windows for Workgroups 3.11
<P>
C:\WINDOWS\SMARTDRV.EXE /X
C:\WINDOWS\net start
C:\WINDOWS\msipx
C:\WINDOWS\netx
PROMPT $p$g
PATH C:\WINDOWS;C:\DOS
SET TEMP=C:\WINDOWS\TEMP
<P>
The following lines in SYSTEM.INI affect running Windows for
Workgroups 3.11 with MSIPX:

NOTE: Windows for Workgroups 3.11 Setup will detect MSIPX when
upgrading from Windows for Workgroups 3.1 and install support for it.
If you change your network configuration after upgrading to Windows
for Workgroups 3.11, however, Setup may remove MSIPX support, and you
will not be able to reinstall support for it. If this is the case,
you will have to upgrade to either IPX.COM, or IPXODI.COM and
LSL.COM.
