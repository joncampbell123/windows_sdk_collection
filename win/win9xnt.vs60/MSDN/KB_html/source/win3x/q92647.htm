<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Faxes Sent and Received Slowly and Lost Characters</h3>
 
<P>
On 80286 machines, sending or receiving faxes may occur slowly, and
some characters may be lost. To correct this problem, do the
following:

<OL><P><LI>Remove terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) programs from the
   AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS files.

<P><LI>If you are using Microsoft MS-DOS 5.0, load MS-DOS low by
   specifying DOS=LOW in the CONFIG.SYS file.

<P><LI>Add the following line to the [Standard] section of the SYSTEM.INI
   file:
<P>
<P><PRE>      FasterModeSwitch=1
</PRE><P>
</OL><h3>Faxes Hang System</h3>
 
<P>
In 386 enhanced mode, if your computer stops responding (hangs) when a
fax is sent or received, add the following lines to the [386Enh]
section of the SYSTEM.INI file:
<P>
<PRE>   COMBoostTime=15
   COMxProtocol=XOFF
   COMxBuffer=1024
   COMxAutoAssign=0

</PRE></OL>Substitute the appropriate COM port for "x."
<P>
<P><h3>After Dark and WinFax Pro</h3>
 
<P>
If you are running version 1.0 of Berkeley Systems' After Dark screen
saver, upgrade to version 2.0 of After Dark.
<P>
According to Delrina Technical Support, if you use WinFax Pro version 2.0
with After Dark version 1.0, After Dark may interfere with the transmission
of faxes.
<P>
As a temporary workaround, you can turn off the After Dark System IO
Monitor:

<OL><P><LI>Run the After Dark control panel.

<P><LI>Select the When option.

<P><LI>Turn off System IO Monitor.
<P>
</OL>Delrina Technical Support does not recommend running both programs from the
Load= line of the WIN.INI file. If After Dark 1.0 appears on the Load= line
with WinFax Pro 2.0, you may not be able to use one of the two
applications.
<P>
<P><h3>Intel Satisfaction</h3>
 
<P>
If you are running the Intel Satisfaction Board with CAS Driver version
1.0, update the CAS Driver to version 2.0.
<P>
<P><h3>Norton Desktop for Windows</h3>
 
<P>
WinFax Pro 2.0 does not run correctly with Norton Desktop for Windows.
<P>
<P><h3>WinFax Pro Makes Itself Default Printer</h3>
 
<P>
WinFax Pro becomes the default printer when you install it and periodically
makes itself the default printer after installation. (This problem also
occurs with Windows 3.0 as well.)
<P>
<P><h3>14.4 Kbps Rate Problems</h3>
 
<P>
If you run WinFax Pro with Windows 3.1 and experience problems at a bit
rate of 14.4 Kbps, call Delrina to receive an update to correct this
problem. If your version of WinFax Pro is an OEM version bundled with a fax
modem, contact your OEM dealer.
<P>
<P><h3>Unable to Start Multimedia Viewer with WinFax</h3>
 
<P>
You may be unable to start Microsoft Multimedia Viewer (VIEWER.EXE) if
WinFax is running. To work around this problem, rename VIEWER.EXE to
VIEW.EXE (or another name).
<P>
WinFax automatically loads a dynamic-link library (DLL) called VIEWER.DLL
that allows you to view received faxes. When you double-click the Viewer
icon, Viewer does not run because it is already in memory and it cannot run
multiple instances. Double-clicking the Viewer icon momentarily displays an
hourglass mouse cursor but no program loads.
<P>
