The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
The following article contains information on the use of Microsoft Windows
with third-party products or configurations that have not been tested and
are not supported by Microsoft.
<P>
If the steps or procedures described in this article do not function
properly, contact the manufacturer of the third-party product for more
information or use a supported configuration.
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Novell NetWare Lite version 1.1 is a peer-to-peer network operating system
for 2 to 25 users. This means that any node on the network has the
potential to be used both as client and as a server for all other machines
attached to the network.
<P>
NetWare Lite is not a supported network for Microsoft Windows versions 3.0
and 3.1, and there is no option available for this network when installing
Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This article contains information about using NetWare Lite with Windows.
Follow the suggestions outlined below to operate your Windows environment.
For further information on integrating Windows 3.1 and NetWare Lite,
contact Novell.
<P>
<P><h3>Network vs. Local Installation of Windows</h3>
 
<P>
It is recommended that you install Windows locally. If you want to install
to a network directory, contact Novell to receive documentation on this
process.
<P>
Follow the regular installation procedures using Windows disks. Windows
Setup may indicate the presence of a "Microsoft Network (or 100%
compatible)" network. Change this selection to "No Network Installed."
<P>
<P><h3>Before Entering Windows</h3>
 
<P>
It is suggested that you run STARTNET.BAT before entering Windows. You also
should map drives and capture ports before entering Windows.
<P>
<P><h3>Mapping Drives</h3>
 
<P>
If a server to which you have mapped a drive goes down, Windows displays a
message indicating that the drive does not contain any files. Any attempt
to access that drive fails. With MS-DOS, this error is trapped and the
client saves enough information to automatically restore the connection to
that network directory when the downed server returns to the network.
Windows prevents MS-DOS from trapping this error. To restore connection to
your mapped drive, exit Windows, and reissue the Net Map command when the
server is back on the network.
<P>
<P><h3>Network Printing</h3>
 
<P>
Use the Net Capture command described in your NetWare Lite documentation to
redirect printing from your LPT1 or LPT2 ports to a network printer before
you enter Windows. Configure your printer in Windows to either the LPT1.OS2
or LPT2.OS2 ports, depending on which port you captured before entering
Windows. Workstations that are configured as both server and client should
use LPT1.OS2 or LPT2.OS2 to print from Windows.
<P>
You also need to disable Fast Printing Direct To Port in the Printer
Connect dialog box. Having this setting enabled bypasses any MS-DOS calls
and therefore is not able to print to any network printers
<P>
To disable the Fast Printing Direct To Port option:

<OL><P><LI>In the Control Panel window, choose the Printers icon.

<P><LI>In the Printers dialog box, choose the Connect button.

<P><LI>Clear the Fast Printing Direct To Port check box.
<P>
</OL><h3>Local Printing</h3>
 
<P>
Once a printer is assigned as a network printer, you should only access
that printer through the network. You may have a printer attached to your
workstation that has been defined as a Network Printer. In this case, you
should capture a port when you want to print to it. If you print to it
directly (not using capture), you may cause print job corruption.
<P>
<P><h3>Changes to the SYSTEM.INI</h3>
 
<P>
For Windows 3.1, make sure that the following lines are in the [386Enh]
section if the SYSTEM.INI file.
<P>
<PRE>   [386Enh]
   UniqueDOSPSP=ON
   PSPIncrement=5
   TimerCriticalSection=10000
   ReflectDOSInt2A=ON
   OverlappedIO=OFF

</PRE></OL>If you do not have these options included in the SYSTEM.INI file, you may
not be able to get into Windows once NetWare Lite is loaded.
<P>
<P><h3>NetWare Lite Messages</h3>
 
<P>
Messages sent to network users through NetWare Lite only appear when you
are at the command prompt or when you exit Windows.
<P>
More information on the use of Windows and NetWare Lite can be found in
Novell's README.TXT file that is included with NetWare Lite. In addition,
Novell has set up an automated fax system to provide information about
using NetWare Lite. This service can be accessed by calling (800) 638-9273
and then pressing the ASTERISK key (*) on your touch-tone telephone.

implied or otherwise, regarding these products' performance or reliability.
