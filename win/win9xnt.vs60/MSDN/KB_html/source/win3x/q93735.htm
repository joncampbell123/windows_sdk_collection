The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When Novell NetWare connectivity is installed and subsequently removed
from Windows for Workgroups, NetWarn=1 is NOT removed from the
[Windows] section of the WIN.INI file.
<P>
Normally if the value of NetWarn= is 1, and if Novell NetWare
connectivity is installed, and if MSIPX and NETX are not loaded, the
following warning message appears when Windows for Workgroups is
started:
<P>
<PRE>   The NetWare Shell has not been loaded.
   All Network functions will be disabled.

</PRE>If Novell NetWare connectivity is removed, the warning message does
not appear when Windows for Workgroups is started.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Some applications, such as Fifth Generation Systems FastBack Plus
Windows version 1.0, may cause Windows for Workgroups to display the
above warning message, indicating that the NetWare shell has not been
loaded, even though the message may be invalid because Novell NetWare
connectivity may not be installed. This error may also cause the
system to stop responding (hang).
<P>
<P><h3>Workaround</h3>
 
<P>
To work around the problem, use a text editor to change the NetWarn=
value to 0 in the [Windows] section of the WIN.INI file or remove the
NetWarn= line entirely.
<P>

Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these
