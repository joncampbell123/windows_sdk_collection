<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If your system requires EGA or Hercules video support for Windows for
Workgroups version 3.11, you have three options for installing this
support:

<UL><LI>Download the necessary files from the Microsoft Download Service (MSDL).
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Install Windows 3.1 or Windows for Workgroups 3.1, choose the correct
   video support, and then upgrade to Windows for Workgroups 3.11.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Rename the SETUP.INF file from Windows for Workgroups 3.1 to
   OEMSETUP.INF and then select the correct video driver.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Windows for Workgroups 3.11 currently does not include video drivers for
EGA and Hercules monochrome display options. Use one of the options listed
below to provide the video support you need.
<P>
<P><h3>Option 1</h3>
 
<P>
If you have a modem, you can download the drivers for EGA (EGA311.EXE) and
Hercules monochrome (HERC311.EXE) displays from the MSDL by calling (425)
936-6735. The MSDL supports 1200, 2400, and 14,400 bits per second (BPS)
(V.32 and V.42) with 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, and no parity.
<P>
<P><h3>Option 2</h3>
 
<P>
Install Windows 3.1 or Windows for Workgroups 3.1, which both have the
video support needed. After you install either operating system with the
video support you require, upgrade your system to Windows for Workgroups
3.11, maintaining the current video driver selected in version 3.1.
<P>
<P><h3>Option 3</h3>
 
<P>
Before you begin this procedure, create a new directory on your hard disk
drive. (You can also use your TEMP directory.)

<OL><P><LI>Copy the SETUP.INF file from Windows for Workgroups 3.1 Disk 1 and
   rename it OEMSETUP.INF in your newly created directory.

<P><LI>At the MS-DOS command prompt, run SETUP.EXE from the Windows directory
   (or from Windows for Workgroups 3.11 Disk 1 if this is a new
   installation) and select the Other Display option from the list of video
   drivers. When Setup prompts you for a location, provide the path to the
   directory in which the "new" OEMSETUP.INF file exists. After you select
   the desired driver, Setup prompts you for the appropriate version 3.1
   disks to copy the required files.

<P><LI>When Setup is finished copying the files, remove the OEMSETUP.INF file
   from the newly created directory. You must also delete the OEMSETUP.INF
   or OEMx.INF file from the Windows SYSTEM subdirectory that matches the
   "new" OEMSETUP.INF's file size and date in the newly created directory.
   This prevents version 3.11 driver selections from being overwritten with
   similar .INF entries that would incorrectly request version 3.1 disks.
