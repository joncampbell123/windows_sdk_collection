</PRE><h3>Introduction</h3>
 
<P>
If you run multiple real-mode transports with Windows for Workgroups
when the protected-mode redirector (VREDIR.386) and the protected-
mode server (VSERVER.386) are loaded, you eventually run out of
network control blocks (NCBs). As a result, you receive the following
error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Too many outstanding commands.

</PRE>The updated VNETBIOS.386 file included with this Application Note
corrects this problem by allotting more hardware control blocks
(HCBs).
<P>
<P><h3>To install the updated VNETBIOS.386 file</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Insert the enclosed WG0970 disk in the appropriate floppy disk
   drive. Copy VNETBIOS.386 to your Windows SYSTEM subdirectory using
   the following command
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy &lt;drive&gt;:\vnetbios.386 &lt;destination&gt;
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;drive&gt;is the floppy disk drive containing the WG0970 disk
   and &lt;destination&gt; is the drive and directory of your Windows SYSTEM
   subdirectory.
<P>
   For example, if the WG0970 disk is in drive A, and your Windows
   directory is C:\WINDOWS, type the following at the MS-DOS command
   prompt and then press ENTER:
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy a:\vnetbios.386 c:\windows\system
</PRE>
<P><LI>Open the SYSTEM.INI file in Microsoft Windows for Workgroups Notepad,
   and edit the Network= entry by changing *vnetbios to vnetbios.386. For
   example, change
<P>
<P><PRE>      Network=*vnetbios,*vwc,vnetsup.386,vredir.386,vserver.386
</PRE><P>
   to:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Network=vnetbios.386,*vwc,vnetsup.386,vredir.386,vserver.386
</PRE>
<P><LI>Add the following line to the [386Enh] section:
<P>
<P><PRE>      NumHCBs=32
</PRE><P>
   The default for NumHCBs is 32. If you are using DEC(R)
   Pathworks(TM), you must increase this value to 64 to avoid running
   out of NCBs. If other installed network components are using a lot
   of NCBs, you may need to use a value higher than 64. The NumHCBs
   entry has no hard-coded limit, but it is limited by memory. You
   shouldn't need to set NumHCBs higher than 96.

<P><LI>Save the SYSTEM.INI file, and then quit and restart Windows.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows for
Workgroups version 3.11. We are researching this problem and will post new
<P><h3>information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.</h3>
