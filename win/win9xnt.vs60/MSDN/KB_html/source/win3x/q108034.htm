The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article provides information about installing Windows for Workgroups
version 3.11 with a Banyan VINES network. The following versions of Banyan
VINES network operating system software are supported with Windows for
Workgroups 3.11:
<P>
<PRE>   Banyan VINES 4.11 (rev.5)
   Banyan VINES 5.00 (rev.5)
   Banyan VINES 5.52 (rev.5) (Token Ring and Ethernet Support)

</PRE>Windows for Workgroups 3.11 provides no files to support connectivity to
the Banyan VINES network. To upgrade your current installation to Windows
for Workgroups 3.11, you must first have an existing working connection to
a Banyan VINES server.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Before installing Windows for Workgroups 3.11, the Banyan server must be
updated with all the appropriate patches and modifications. Banyan patches
are available on CompuServe in the Banyan forum (type "go banyan" [without
the quotation marks] at the ! prompt). If you have any questions about
Banyan-related files, or if you are not sure if you have the latest patches
available for your installation, call Banyan VINES technical support.
<P>
Windows for Workgroups 3.11 Setup recognizes Banyan VINES connectivity and
maintains it as the secondary network. Installation should be seamless with
no further action required by the user.
<P>
As with previous versions of Windows, it is necessary to be able to log on
to Banyan VINES from MS-DOS before Windows connectivity can be ensured.
<P>
The load order of the drivers in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file is important for
maintaining VINES connectivity. If there are any problems during the
upgrade and/or the Banyan login screen does not appear as usual after
rebooting, check for error messages during the boot process and check the
AUTOEXEC.BAT file to ensure the Banyan VINES files are loading and are in
the correct order. The correct files and their order in the AUTOEXEC.BAT
file are:
<P>
<PRE>Order in AUTOEXEC.BAT       Description
</PRE> 
<P>
<PRE>C:\WINDOWS\NET INITIALIZE   This command is for Windows for Workgroups
                            3.11. It allows loading the files into memory
                            without invoking them.

CD\&lt;BANYAN FILES&gt;           This command changes to the directory where
                            the Banyan files are located. This is necessary
                            because Banyan cannot read the full path and
                            must be in the appropriate directory to load
                            the file.

BAN /NC                     Loads BAN.EXE without initializing Banyan's
                            communications hardware on the system.

NDISBAN                     Loads the NDIS-specific portion of the VINES
                            software.

                            NOTE: If you are using a Token Ring network
                            and Banyan VINES 5.52 (rev.5) you should use
                            NDTOKBAN.COM instead of NDISBAN.COM. For more
                            information on query on the following words in
                            the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

                               WORKGROUPS and NDISBAN.COM

REDIRALL                    Loads REDIRALL.EXE, which is redirector support
                            for all versions of DOS.

C:\WINDOWS\NET START        This command from Windows starts the network
                            software.

ARSWAIT                     This command "Address Resolution Server Wait,"
                            holds further processing until your computer
                            has been assigned a network address by a
                            server. After it sees that your computer has
                            received a network address from the network, it
                            exits and allows your computer to continue.
                            This function is normally built into VINES
                            native drivers, but NDIS requires that this
                            functionality be added after the NDIS driver
                            BAN.EXE is loaded.

Z:LOGIN                     Brings up the Banyan VINES login screen.

</PRE>If there are no error messages at startup, but you are having problems in
Windows for Workgroups with VINES connectivity, check the SYSTEM.INI file.
<P>
<P><h3>SYSTEM.INI File Entries</h3>
 
<P>
The following entries should be made to the SYSTEM.INI file when you
install Windows for Workgroups 3.11 with Banyan VINES connectivity:
<P>
[boot]
secondnet=Z:vines.drv
<P>
[boot.description]
secondnet.drv=Banyan VINES (version x.xx(x))
<P>
[386Enh]
secondnet=z:vvinesd.386
<P>
[Network]
multinet=vines411
<P>
<P><h2>REFERENCES</h2>

Additional information on Banyan VINES connectivity can be found in the
NETWORK.WRI file and in the Windows for Workgroups Resource Kit version
3.11.

Banyan VINES Technical Support can be reached at (800) 2-BANYAN. To access
the Banyan VINES forum on CompuServe type "go banyan" (without the
quotation marks) at the ! prompt in CompuServe.
