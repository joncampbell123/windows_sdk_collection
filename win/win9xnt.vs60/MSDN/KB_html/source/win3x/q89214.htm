<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article discusses how to enable the Microsoft Windows version 3.1
OLE drag and drop functionality in version 1.0 of Freelance for Windows.
Because version 1.0 of Freelance for Windows was developed before OLE
technology, you must manually edit the REG.DAT file to allow the
application to support this functionality in Windows 3.1.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In Windows 3.1, you can open or embed a document by dragging a file from a
directory in File Manager and placing the file on a minimized application,
or by dragging the file into the window of an active application. This
process is known as dragging and dropping.
<P>
For drag-and-drop functionality to work, the application being used in
conjunction with File Manager must directly support dynamic data exchange
(DDE) messaging.
<P>
For more information about drag-and-drop functionality, refer to pages
58-59 of the "Microsoft Windows User's Guide."
