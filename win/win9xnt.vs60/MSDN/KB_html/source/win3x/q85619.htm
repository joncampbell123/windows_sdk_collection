<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a 3.1, 3.11

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Windows provides an option to set up applications. You can set up
applications located on network drives if the network is connected and
included in the PATH environment variable.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Applications can automatically be installed for Windows with Windows Setup.
The Windows Setup icon is located in the Main group.
<P>
Windows searchs the specified drive for applications and creates an icon
for each application you select. In Windows 3.1, the search path defaults
to "Path" in the Setup Applications dialog box. Path represents the
directories listed in the path of the AUTOEXEC.BAT file (or the PATH
variable).
<P>
Other drives may be selected; however, if a network directory needs to be
searched, that drive must be connected and included in the PATH variable.
<P>
To connect to a network drive in Windows, from the File Manager Disk menu,
choose Network Connections (Connect to Network in Windows 3.0). You can
also connect to network drives at the MS-DOS level.
<P>
Once the network drive is connected, it must be included in the path.
From the MS-DOS command prompt, type
<P>
<PRE>   set path=%path%;x:

</PRE>where x is the active (connected) network drive.
<P>
When viewing the list of drives from the Setup Applications dialog box, the
network drives will be noted as [unknown drive]. Hard disk drives are noted
as [local drive].
