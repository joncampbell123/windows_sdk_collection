The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Windows for Workgroups add-on for Windows 3.1 users does
not allow a new installation of Windows for Workgroups; it is an
upgrade for Microsoft Windows version 3.1 only.
<P>
If the upgrade fails during installation, you may not be able to run
SETUP.EXE again. To work around this problem, remove the SETUPSTATE=
line from the [BOOT.DESCRIPTION] section of the SYSTEM.INI file.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
During the upgrade process, SETUP.EXE adds the line
<P>
<PRE>   SETUPSTATE=

</PRE>to the [BOOT.DESCRIPTION] section of the SYSTEM.INI file. When this
line is present, SETUP.EXE does not allow the installation of Windows
for Workgroups, and the following error message will be displayed:
<P>
<PRE>   Windows 3.1 could not be located on your computer. This version of
   Windows for Workgroups requires that Windows 3.1 already be
   installed. You must either install Windows 3.1 on your computer,
   or purchase the complete version of Windows for Workgroups.

</PRE>To allow Windows for Workgroups to install correctly (provided you
have Windows 3.1 on your computer), remove the SETUPSTATE= line.
<P>
NOTE: The failed upgrade installation may also leave the following
line in the SYSTEM.INI:
<P>
<PRE>   SHELL=SETUP.EXE

</PRE>The statement should be SHELL=PROGMAN.EXE. You may need to make this
change as well.
