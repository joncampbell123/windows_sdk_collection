<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If you run Central Point Backup version 7.0 or 7.1 for MS-DOS under
Windows version 3.1, DMA buffer size may be too small. To increase the
DMA buffer size, add the following line to the SYSTEM.INI file under
the [386Enh] section:
<P>
<PRE>   DMABUFFERSIZE=18

</PRE>You may need to experiment to find a value that works on your machine.
A value in the range of 18 to 64 should work correctly.
<P>
If you have problems running Central Point Backup when TrueType fonts
are enabled, increase the BUFFERS setting in the CONFIG.SYS file to at
least 30.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Some tape backup systems require that DMABUFFERSIZE be set to 64,
which is what Central Point recommends. The disadvantage of increasing
the buffer size is that increasing the DMA buffer size uses up
conventional memory for all applications running under Windows.
<P>
The Windows version of Central Point Backup does not require the
increase in DMA buffer size. If you are going to use a backup program
under Windows, Microsoft recommends you use a Windows backup program,
such as the one that comes with PC Tools.
<P>
Some tape backup systems may run successfully no matter what setting
is used for the DMA buffer size. Resetting the DMA buffer size will
not enhance performance on such systems, even though the DMA buffer
message is displayed. For more information about using Central Point
Backup with such systems, contact Central Point Software.
<P>
The Central Point Backup product included here is manufactured by a
vendor independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or
otherwise, regarding this product's performance or reliability.
