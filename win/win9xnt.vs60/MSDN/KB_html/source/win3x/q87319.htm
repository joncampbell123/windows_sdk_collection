<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If Windows is set up with a network install (using the SETUP /N
command), you cannot configure an individual copy of MIDI mapper for
each workstation. Instead, if you run MIDI mapper, it will always
default to the share directory on the network (W:\WINSHARE).
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
The only possible workaround is to set up Windows on each workstation.
This way each user will have his or her own copy of MIDI mapper.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
MIDI mapper is an application that allows you to set up information such as
key maps, patch maps, and channel mappings for a MIDI device. Because it is
possible for different workstations on a network to have different sound
cards, each workstation should be able to be configured independently.
Windows, through a network installation, does not allow you to do this. It
will always look to the shared directory to find the files MIDIMAP.DRV and
MIDIMAP.CFG. Even if these files are copied to each individual's user
directory, MIDI mapper will still look to the shared directory for its
information.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows version 3.1.
We are researching this problem and will post new information here
as it becomes available.
