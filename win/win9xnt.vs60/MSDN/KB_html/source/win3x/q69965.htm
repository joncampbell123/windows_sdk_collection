The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When Windows 3.0 is set up on a network workstation via the SETUP /N
command, a Windows Setup Hardware List appears with a Display option.
<P>
If some of these workstations have Super VGA cards (SVGA) that can deliver
800 x 600 or 1024 x 768 resolutions, then it is possible to add the proper
manufacturers' software driver as an option to the Hardware List by editing
the SETUP.INF before running SETUP /N on the individual workstations.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Use the following outline to add additional video display driver Options
via the SETUP.INF file.

<OL><P><LI>Copy the display drivers for the video card into the shared Windows
   directory. Make sure that none of the files replace existing Windows
   files.

<P><LI>Edit SETUP.INF with a standard ASCII text editor and locate the
   lines:
<P>
<P><PRE>      [display]
      ;profile=driver, description of driver, resolution, 286 grabber,
      logo code, VDD, 386grabber, ega.sys, logo data
</PRE>
<P><LI>Add a new line to this section of the SETUP.INF following the
   format above exactly. Use the entry for Windows standard VGA as
   a reference point and substitute the new .DRV, .GR3, or VDD file
   names as supplied by the manufacturer.
<P>
</OL>For example, if the custom video driver you received for your Paradise
video card came with two files, PVGA800.DRV (a 800 x 600 driver) and
VPVGA.GR3, then you would add a new line under [DISPLAY] for the new
video driver and resolution. Copy the line for the standard "VGA"
driver line exactly (commas and quotation marks are IMPORTANT), but
change the profile, driver, description of driver, and 386grabber to
match the new driver. If you want to use the larger 8514 fonts, you
may also want to change the resolution option from "100,96,96" to
"100,120,120":
<P>
<P><h3>Example</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   P800VGA=7:PVGA800.DRV, "Paradise 800x600 16 Color",
   "100,120,120", 3:vgacolor.gr2, 2:vgalogo.lgo, x:*vddvga,
   7:vpvga.gr3,, 2:vgalogo.rle

              a real and standard modes

logo code     Startup logo to use

vdd           Virtual display driver - video display
              for virtual machines in 386 enhanced mode

386grabber    Screen grabber for old applications in
              enhanced mode.

ega.sys       Where to find EGA.SYS if needed

logo data     Logo information to be bound into WIN.COM

</PRE>The SETUP.INF file is a comma delineated text file formatted for 160
columns that supplies customized directions to the SETUP.EXE.
<P>
<P><h3>Preferred Workstation Setup Method</h3>
 
<P>
Install Windows 3.0 on a network (see pages 543-556 of the "Microsoft
Windows User's Guide"), and then run the SETUP /N command on each
workstation. In some instances (for example, large workstation groups) it
may not be efficient to do this and then customize each workstation
individually. By editing the SETUP.INF file with a text editor, it is
possible to enhance the SETUP /N command so that it customizes each
workstation to a company standard.
