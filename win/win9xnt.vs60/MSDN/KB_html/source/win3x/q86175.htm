The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11
<LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run MS-DOS Prompt under Microsoft Windows or Windows for
Workgroups in 386 enhanced mode on a Novell network, you may lose your
environment parameters. You can view your MS-DOS environment settings by
issuing the SET command at the MS-DOS command prompt before you start
Windows, or at the MS-DOS Prompt under Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
If you are losing your MS-DOS environment variables, use the following
troubleshooting steps to ensure a consistent MS-DOS environment:

<OL><P><LI>Make sure the correct Novell NetWare drivers are selected in
   Windows Setup. There are five NetWare selections under Windows 3.1
   Setup:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Novell NetWare (shell versions 3.21 and above)
      Novell NetWare (shell versions 3.26 and above)
      Novell NetWare (shell versions below 3.01)
      Novell NetWare (shell versions below 3.21)
      Novell NetWare 2.10 or above, or Novell NetWare 386
</PRE><P>
   To check which shell version you are currently using, issue the
   following command at the MS-DOS command prompt (you must be logged
   onto the network to issue this command):
<P>
<P><PRE>      NETX I
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      -or-
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      NVER
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    NOTE: If you are using NetWare version 3.32 (released for
    MS-DOS 6 support), use NETX.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Verify that the VIPX.386 file is located in the Windows/SYSTEM
   directory.

<P><LI>Ensure that the COMSPEC environmental variable is being set
   correctly in the CONFIG.SYS file. The following line should be
   present in the CONFIG.SYS file:
<P>
<P><PRE>      SHELL=C:\DOS\COMMAND.COM C:\DOS\ /e:2048 /p
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: The above line assumes that the COMMAND.COM file is
   located in the C:\DOS directory.

<P><LI>Update the NETX and IPX to the most recent version. Windows version
   3.1 supplies NETX.COM version 3.26 and an IPX.OBJ file that you can
   use to generate a Windows 3.1 compatible version of IPX.COM. Be
   sure to select
<P>
<P><PRE>      Novell NetWare (shell versions 3.26 and  above)
</PRE><P>
   in the Windows Setup.

<P><LI>Update any supporting Novell files such as LOGIN.EXE to the most
   current version available.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The MS-DOS environment can also be lost or garbled if multiple
protocols are installed on a single workstation. For example, a
workstation might have drivers for the IBM DOS LAN Requester network
and drivers for Novell NetWare installed. This allows the workstation
to access both OS/2 LAN Servers and Novell NetWare servers. However,
if the Windows Setup is configured for "IBM OS/2 Lan Server" instead
of "Novell NetWare (shell version)", then the DOS environment will be
lost or garbled when you run MS-DOS Prompt from Windows in 386
enhanced mode.
<P>
To correct this problem, make sure that the Novell NetWare drivers are
loading, and that the LAN Server drivers are not. The Windows NetWare
drivers need to be loaded for the Novell Network to run properly in
386 enhanced mode Windows.
