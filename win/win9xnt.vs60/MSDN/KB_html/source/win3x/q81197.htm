<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Windows File Manager can support an Undelete command using a
third-party add-on extension. When such an extension is installed, an
Undelete menu command becomes available under the File menu of File
Manager.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
For File Manager to show the Undelete command, a third-party extension
dynamic link library (DLL) utility is required. By default, the File
Manager searches the Windows system directory (for example,
C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM) for an extension DLL. File Manager looks in a different
directory if the extension DLL path is specified by the token UNDELETE.DLL
in the [Settings] section of the WINFILE.INI file. A third-party
application either copies its extension DLL into the Windows system
directory or modifies the WINFILE.INI file during its installation.
<P>
If this file is found and contains the program code to undelete files,
then File Manager displays the Undelete command under the Delete command in
the File menu. Whenever you select the Undelete command, the File Manager
calls the extension DLL to perform the Undelete command.
<P>
To add or modify a third-party extension DLL that provides an undelete
functionality, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Open the WINFILE.INI file located in the Windows directory.

<P><LI>Add or modify the following line under the [Settings] section,
   replacing &lt;filename&gt; with the location of the extension DLL:
<P>
<P><PRE>      UNDELETE.DLL=&lt;filename&gt;
</PRE>
<P><LI>Save the file and restart File Manager for the changes to take
   effect.
<P>
</OL>More information about File Manager extensions and developing these
type of programs is available in the Microsoft Windows 3.1 Software
Development Kit (SDK).
