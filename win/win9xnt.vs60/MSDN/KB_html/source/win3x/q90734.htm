           All the compressed files have been renamed using the .XX_
           convention. A message that displays when the .EXE file is
           run was also added. These changes are designed to reduce
           the problems that occur when the .EXE file is run from the
           Windows directory or Windows SYSTEM subdirectory.

           In addition, the LICENSE.TXT file was replaced with the
           current revision.

</PRE><h3>Tseng ET4000 - 32K Color (TSENG3.EXE)</h3>
 
<P>
06/15/92 - THE DRIVERS HAVE NOT CHANGED. All the compressed files
<PRE>           were renamed using the .XX_ convention. A message that
           displays when the .EXE file is run was also added. These
           changes are designed to reduce the problems that occur when
           the .EXE file is run from the Windows directory or Windows
           SYSTEM subdirectory.

           In addition, the LICENSE.TXT file was replaced with the
           current revision.

</PRE>05/06/92 - No change was made to the driver or supporting files.
<P>
<PRE>           WIN.CNF was added to TSENG3.EXE to work around a
           maintenance mode setup problem (users may be prompted for a
           Windows disk to access WIN.CNF).

</PRE><h3>Tseng ET4000 - 64K Color (TSENG4.EXE)</h3>
 
<P>
06/15/92 - THE DRIVERS HAVE NOT CHANGED. All the compressed files
<PRE>           were renamed using the .XX_ convention. A message that
           displays when the .EXE file is run was also added. These
           changes are designed to reduce the problems that occur when
           the .EXE file is run from the Windows directory or Windows
           SYSTEM subdirectory.

           In addition, the LICENSE.TXT file was replaced with the
           current revision.

</PRE>05/28/92 - Corrected an internal ID string in the OEMSETUP.INF file
<PRE>           for the ET4000 640-by-480 64K entry. The problem showed up
           when you selected ET4000 800-by-600 64K small fonts. You
           ended up with the 640-by-480 driver (because they had the
           same internal description string). When you try to
           reinstall the driver, it installs properly. No driver fixes
           are included in the new TSENG4.EXE file.

</PRE>05/06/92 - No change was made to the driver or supporting files.
<P>
<PRE>           WIN.CNF was added to TSENG4.EXE to work around a

</PRE><h3>Western Digital Paradise 90C30 Drivers (WD9030.EXE)</h3>
 
<P>
02/03/93 - These drivers are new to the WDL. They support the
<PRE>           following resolutions and colors:

             - 640 x 480 256 colors
             - 640 x 480 32K colors
             - 640 x 480 32K colors (Ventura Publisher, Aldus PageMaker
                                    only)
             - 640 x 480 64K colors
             - 800 x 600 256 colors (512K)
             - 800 x 600 256 colors (1 MB)
             - 800 x 600 32K colors
             - 800 x 600 32K colors (Ventura Publisher, Aldus PageMaker
                                    only)
             - 800 x 600 64K colors
             - 1024 x 768 16 colors
             - 1024 x 768 256 colors (1 MB)
             - 1280 x 960 16 colors
             - 1280 x 1024 16 colors

            NOTE: The 32K color 640 x 480 and 800 x 600 resolution
            drivers both have a specific driver for use with Ventura
            Publisher and Aldus PageMaker. Neither of these
            applications functions with 32K colors. The 32K color
            drivers provided for Ventura Publisher and Aldus PageMaker
            (P32K480X.DRV and P32K600X.DRV) do not have the capability
            of the full 32K colors.
