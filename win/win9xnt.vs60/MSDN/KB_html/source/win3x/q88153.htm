<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Sound Master II, manufactured by Covox Tympanum Corporation, emulates
an Adlib Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) card. Windows 3.1
digitized sound drivers for the Sound Master II card are available
through the Covox BBS numbers listed below.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Although the Sound Master II is compatible with the Adlib MIDI card,
the MIDI port on the card needs specific Covox drivers for MIDI
support under Windows 3.1. Covox is currently developing these drivers
and they will be available on the Covox BBS when they are completed.
<P>
The Covox BBS also includes an updated Wave form audio driver dated
July 10, 1992. If you have a Covox sound device and use Windows 3.1,
Covox recommends obtaining the newest wave form driver.
<P>
For additional information, contact Covox technical support or
download the file WINHELP.TXT (from the Covox BBS), which provides
information on installing Covox drivers for Windows 3.1.
<P>
The products included here, Sound Master II and Adlib MIDI card, are
manufactured by vendors independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty,
implied or otherwise, regarding these products' performance or
reliability.
