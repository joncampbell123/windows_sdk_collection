The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Windows for Workgroups Setup detects certain networks and
allows for specific IRQ and I/O address settings for individual network
interface cards (NICs). Setup does not accept any settings other than those
it provides. This behavior can be a problem if you are using a network card
that allows an IRQ or I/O address setting other than those provided by
Windows for Workgroups. This article includes procedures that may help you
work around such problems.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To change the IRQ or I/O address for a single installation:

<OL><P><LI>During Windows for Workgroups Setup, install the appropriate
   network card and select any of the available settings.

<P><LI>Open the PROTOCOL.INI file in an ASCII text editor, such as
   Microsoft Windows Notepad.

<P><LI>Locate the network card section for your card. Section headings
   appear as follows:
<P>
<P><PRE>      [netcardname]
</PRE><P>
   where "netcardname" is a unique identifier for your network card. (For
   example, the heading for an Intel EtherExpress 16 is [ms$ee16], and
   the heading for an NE 1000 compatible card is [ms$ne1clone].) If you
   are not sure what the identifier for your card is, check the [netcard]
   section of the NETWORK.INF file. This section contains a list of
   supported network cards and their corresponding identifiers.

<P><LI>Once you locate the [netcard] section, find two lines similar to the
   following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      IRQ=
      IOADDRESS=
</PRE><P>
   Note: The exact wording of these lines varies from card to card.

<P><LI>Change these lines to reflect the settings that your network card is
   actually using. The IRQ value must be a valid number between 0 and 15.
   The IOADDRESS value must be a valid hexadecimal I/O address or must
   take the form 0xNNN, where "NNN" is the address, (for example,
   IOADDRESS=0x300).

<P><LI>Save these changes, then reboot your computer.
<P>
   Note: If you regenerate the PROTOCOL.INI file by reinstalling Windows
   or by removing and then reinstalling the network card in the Network
   dialog box of Control Panel, these changes are lost.
<P>
</OL>To change the IRQ or I/O address for multiple installations:
<P>
Note: The changes below affect all subsequent installations of Windows
for Workgroups that have the specified network card. Be sure to make a
backup of the NETWORK.INF file before you make any changes to it.

<OL><P><LI>Open the NETWORK.INF file in a ASCII text editor, such as Microsoft
   Windows Notepad.

<P><LI>Locate the [netcard_protocol] section for your network card. These
   sections generally have the following form:
<P>
<P><PRE>      [netcardname_nif] or [netcardname_xif]
</PRE><P>
   where "netcardname" is a unique identifier for your network card.

<P><LI>Once you locate the [netcard_protocol] section for your card, find
   the following two lines:
<P>
<P><PRE>      io=&lt;description,type,range,default,flags&gt;
      irq=&lt;description,type,range,default,flags&gt;
</PRE><P>
   where "type" is the parameter type, "range" is the range of values for
   the parameter, and "default" is the default value or the parameter.
<P>
   Note: Some fields may be missing in the actual statements. The
   following is an example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      irq=IRQ,,text,"3,4,5,9",3
      io=IOADDRESS,,hex,"0x280,0x3f0,0x10","0x300"
</PRE><P>
   The following table describes the common type, range, and default
   values:
<P>
<PRE>      Type    Range                Default   Definition
      -------------------------------------------------------------------

      Static  Default              N/A       The value cannot be changed
      Text    "Value, value,..."   Yes       List of text values
      Int     "First, last, step"  Yes       Integer range
      Hex     "First, last, step"  Yes       Integer range in hexadecimal

</PRE><P><LI>The values for the I/O address or the IRQ can then be modified by
   changing the values inside a text list or the first, last, or step
   values of an integer or hexadecimal range. For example
<P>
<P><PRE>      irq=IRQ,,text,"3,4,5,9",3 can be changed to include irq 7.
      irq=IRQ,,text,"3,4,5,7,9",3
</PRE><P>
   io=IOADDRESS,,hex,"0x280,0x3f0,0x10","0x300" can be changed to include
   I/O address 200h by lowering the first value as follows:
<P>
<P><PRE>      io=IOADDRESS,,hex,"0x200,0x3f0,0x10","0x300"
</PRE><P>
   Note: The default value following the range MUST be a value in the
   range.

<P><LI>Save the changes to the NETWORK.INF file. The Setup program then
   displays the setting that you added as a selection in the appropriate
   box.
<P>
</OL>For more information, refer to Chapters 5 and 6 of the "Windows for
Workgroups Resource Kit" manual.
