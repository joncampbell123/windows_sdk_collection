The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The licensing policy for the Microsoft Windows operating system
version 3.1 is different from the licensing policy for Windows 3.0.
The Windows 3.1 licensing agreement allows for only one installation
per license.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Under the licensing agreements for Microsoft applications software and
Windows 3.0, if the software is permanently installed on the hard disk
or other storage device of a computer (other than a network server)
and one person uses that computer more than 80 percent of the time it
is in use, then that person may also use the software on a portable or
home computer.
<P>
However, Windows 3.1 is considered systems software and therefore
follows the same licensing agreement as MS-DOS (that is, you must
purchase one copy of the software for each machine).
<P>
The following is a copy from Grant of License section of Windows 3.1
license card:
<P>
<PRE>   Grant of License. Microsoft grants to you the right to use one copy of
   the enclosed Microsoft software program (the "SOFTWARE") on a single
   computer. The SOFTWARE is in "use" on a computer when it is loaded
   into temporary memory (i.e., RAM) or installed into permanent memory
   (e.g., hard disk, CD-ROM, or other storage device) of that computer.
   However, installation on a network server for the sole purpose of
   distribution to one or more other computer(s) shall not constitute
   "use" for which a separate license is required.

</PRE>All Microsoft license agreements are version-specific, meaning that
they apply only to the version of the product that you acquired with
the license. If you upgrade from Windows 3.0 to Windows 3.1, you only
have one license for Windows. The Windows 3.1 license replaces the
Windows 3.0 license.
