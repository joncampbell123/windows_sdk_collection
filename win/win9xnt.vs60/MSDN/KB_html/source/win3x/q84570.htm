The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Windows 3.1 usually relies on the MOUSE.INI file to tell the
MOUSE.DRV file which port the mouse is connected to. Windows 3.1 can find
the MOUSE.INI file in any directory, depending on specific environment and
SYSTEM.INI settings. Incorrect settings in either the MOUSE.INI file,
SYSTEM.INI file, or the "set mouse=" variable may prevent the mouse from
working in Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Windows 3.1 looks for the MOUSE.INI file in the following order:

<OL><P><LI>The directory specified in the "set mouse=&lt;directory&gt;" statement in
   the AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

<P><LI>The directory specified on the "MOUSE.DRV=&lt;drive&gt;:&lt;path&gt;MOUSE.DRV"
   line of the SYSTEM.INI file. If no directory is specified, Windows
   defaults to your Windows directory.
<P>
</OL>If there is no MOUSE.INI file in any of these directories, Windows
creates one. The MOUSE.INI file contains the following:
<P>
<PRE>   [mouse]
   MouseType= &lt;port where Windows 3.1 found a mouse&gt;

</PRE></OL>If there is a MOUSE.INI file but the mouse is plugged into a different
port than what's specified by the MouseType= parameter, the mouse
driver changes the MouseType= parameter to reflect the port in which
it did find a mouse.
<P>
For example, if the MOUSE.INI reads "MouseType=Serial1", but you later
change the mouse to COM2, then the mouse driver changes the MOUSE.INI
to read "MouseType=Serial2" the next time it's loaded.
<P>
The "set mouse=" variable in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file overrides the path
settings of the MOUSE.DRV=  in the SYSTEM.INI file during Windows
3.1's search for the MOUSE.INI file.
<P>
For example,
<P>
<PRE>   If the file:      Contains this line:
   ------------      -------------------
   AUTOEXEC.BAT      set mouse=C:\MOUSE\ONE
   SYSTEM.INI        mouse.drv=D:\MICE\TWO

</PRE>then Windows 3.1 looks for MOUSE.INI in the C:\MOUSE\ONE directory.
(If there is no MOUSE.INI file there, one is created in C:\MOUSE\ONE.)
<P>
If there is no "set mouse=" variable, Windows 3.1 uses the MOUSE.INI
file in the path settings of the "mouse.drv=" in the SYSTEM.INI.
<P>
For example,
<P>
<PRE>   If the file:       Contains this line:
   ------------       -------------------

   AUTOEXEC.BAT       none
   SYSTEM.INI         mouse.drv=D:\MICE\TWO

</PRE>then Windows 3.1 looks for MOUSE.INI in the D:\MICE\TWO directory. (If
there is no MOUSE.INI file there, one is created in D:\MICE\TWO.)
<P>
If the "set mouse=" variable is set to a nonexistant directory, no
MOUSE.INI file is used; Windows 3.1 simply looks for the first port with
a mouse connected to it.  No MOUSE.INI file is created.
<P>
The Microsoft Mouse software search in Windows is as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   InPort mouse
   Bus mouse
   PS/2
   COM2
   COM1
