1. Q. Does Microsoft Windows for Workgroups support Novell
      NetWare?

   A. Windows for Workgroups does support the network-specific
      features
      of Novell NetWare. However, ArcNet(R) is not supported with the
      Microsoft IPX transport. For additional information, please
      refer to the section titled "Using Novell NetWare" in Chapter 6
      of the "Getting Started" manual.

2. Q. When I run Microsoft Windows for Workgroups, what changes
      are made within Novell NetWare?

   A. Microsoft has created two new components that take the place of
      the Novell IPX.COM file. These components are MSIPX.SYS and
      MSIPX.COM. The MSIPX.SYS file provides compatibility with the
      Network Driver Interface Specification (NDIS). This NDIS
      compatibility gives the MSIPX transport the flexibility to bind
      with different network adapter cards without requiring the
      Novell regeneration procedure each time you change a driver.
      MSIPX.SYS is loaded as a device driver in the CONFIG.SYS file
      after the device driver PROTMAN.DOS. MSIPX.COM is loaded in the
      AUTOEXEC.BAT file before NETX.COM. (NETX.COM is the NetWare
      command-line shell redirector. It is not modified for use with
      Windows for Workgroups.)

      The Novell Opened Datalink Interface (ODI) is not supported by
      Windows for Workgroups. For this reason, PROTMAN.DOS replaces
      the Novell LSL.COM file. Both files allow for multiplexing
      transports and network cards. However, PROTMAN.DOS provides an
      NDIS interface; LSL.COM provides for ODI. In addition, Windows
      for Workgroups defaults to drive letter P as the LastDrive=
      setting and uses the MS-DOS letters up to P to connect with
      other Windows for Workgroups machines. The default login drive
      for Novell NetWare is usually F; with Windows for Workgroups it
      is changed to Q. Therefore, you may need to change some Novell
      login scripts or the LastDrive= statement. You can map Novell
      network drives to drive letters A through P.

3. Q. What steps do I take to add Novell NetWare connectivity to
      Microsoft Windows for Workgroups?

   A. You can add the Novell NetWare network-specific features either
      during or after Windows for Workgroups Setup. If you have
      already installed Windows for Workgroups, use all four following
      steps. If you are adding Novell NetWare connectivity during
      setup, skip steps 1 and 2.

      1. In the Control Panel window, choose the Network icon.

      2. Choose the Networks button at the bottom of the Network
         Settings dialog box.

      3. In the Available Network Types dialog box, select Novell
         NetWare, and choose the Add button.

      4. After you provide the appropriate files from the setup
         disks, Novell NetWare appears in the box titled Other
         Networks In Use. Choose the OK button. You must restart
         Windows before this change can take affect.

      Your Novell NetWare server may be running protocols in addition
      to what you have already installed. Windows for Workgroups
      supports only the MSIPX protocol with Novell NetWare.

4. Q. How can I connect to Novell NetWare drives and printers with
      Microsoft Windows for Workgroups installed?

   A. To connect to Novell NetWare drives and printers, you must have
      access rights for these servers and their resources. If you
      cannot view NetWare drives and printers in the NetWare Connect
      dialog boxes, you can manually enter the server name and
      directory in the Path box. The proper syntax for this entry is
      &lt;"servername/volumename:directoryname" (without the quotation
      marks)&gt;. To connect to Novell NetWare servers for disk and
      printer access, your workstation must use the same protocols. If
      you do not know which protocols your Novell NetWare server uses,
      check with the system administrator.

5. Q. How can I find out which protocols are installed on my
      computer?

   A. To determine which protocols are configured on your computer,
      use the following two steps:

      1. In the Control Panel window, choose the Network icon.

      2. In the Network Settings dialog box, choose the Adapters
         button.

      The protocols are listed in the parentheses beside the network
      card name.

6. Q. I'm running Microsoft Windows for Workgroups on a Novell
      Token Ring network and am receiving the error message "File
      server cannot be found." What is causing this error?

   A. If you are running on a Novell Token Ring network, the error
      message "File server cannot be found" may be caused by loading
      ROUTE.COM in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file. Edit the AUTOEXEC.BAT file
      and remove the line that loads ROUTE.COM. After you save the
      file, restart the machine. If the message continues to be
      displayed, the network hardware may be failing and should be
      checked.

7. Q. I'm running Microsoft Windows for Workgroups on a Novell
      Ethernet network and am receiving the error message "File server
      cannot be found." What should I do in this case?

   A. If you are running on a Novell Ethernet network, the error
      message "File server cannot be found" may be caused by an
      incorrect Ethernet frame type setting in the PROTOCOL.INI file.
      To correct this problem, use the following four steps:

      1. In the Control Panel window, choose the Network icon, then
         choose the Adapters button.

      2. Select the adapter that is bound to MSIPX, choose the
         Setup button, then choose the Advanced button.

      3. Select Novell IPX from the Protocols In Use box, then
         choose the Settings button.

      4. In the Adapter Media Type Value box, you will see either
         Novell/Ethernet or Ethernet_II(DIX). Note which parameter is
         indicated, and then select the other Media Type parameter.
