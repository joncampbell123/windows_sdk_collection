   NOTE: Machines manufactured by Compaq after April 1, 1994, that
   ship with Windows 3.1 come preinstalled with a virtual keyboard
   driver (VKD) that corrects this problem. Upgrading to Windows for
   Workgroups 3.11 leaves this VKD in place and allows the keyboard to
   work properly. However, if you install Windows for Workgroups 3.11
   to a new directory, the keyboard stops functioning. If you perform
   such an installation, you must manually install the new VKD.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The keyboard controllers in these machines generate unnecessary
interrupts each time a key is pressed and released. The keyboard stops
responding because the Windows for Workgroups 3.11 VKD, unlike the
Windows 3.1 VKD, does not ignore these extra interrupts.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To correct this problem, use one of the following methods:

<UL><LI>Install the new VKDA.386 file provided with this Application Note.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Install the Microsoft Mouse version 9.x driver. The replacement VKD
   that comes with this software (MOUSEVKD.386) handles the extra
   interrupts generated by the keyboards.
<P>
   NOTE: You may also be able to download a new VKD from the your
   computer manufacturer's bulletin board service (BBS). For example,
   SP0738.ZIP, which is available on the COMPAQ(R) BBS, contains a new
   VKD that corrects this problem. Contact your computer manufacturer
   to see if an updated driver is available.
<P>
</UL><h3>To install the new VKDA.386 file</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Insert the enclosed WG0974 disk in the appropriate floppy disk
   drive.

<P><LI>To copy the file to the Windows SYSTEM subdirectory, type the
   following at the MS-DOS command prompt and then press ENTER
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy &lt;drive&gt;:\vkda.386 &lt;destination&gt;
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;drive&gt; is the floppy disk drive containing the WG0974 disk
   and &lt;destination&gt; is the drive and directory of your Windows SYSTEM
   subdirectory.
<P>
   For example, if the WG0974 disk is in drive A and your Windows
   directory is called WINDOWS and is on drive C, type the following
   at the MS-DOS command prompt and then press ENTER:
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy a:\vkda.386 c:\windows\system
</PRE>
<P><LI>Use a text editor to edit the keyboard= entry in the [386Enh]
   section of the SYSTEM.INI file. Change
<P>
<P><PRE>      keyboard=*vkd
</PRE><P>
   to:
<P>
<P><PRE>      keyboard=c:\windows\system\vkda.386
