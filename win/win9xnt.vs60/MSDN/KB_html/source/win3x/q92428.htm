<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Attachmate Corporation's Extra! for Windows requires a Data Link Control
(DLC) driver to work with Windows for Workgroups. This driver supplies the
DLC protocol and allows 3270 emulators to communicate with host systems.
<P>
The Microsoft DLC driver, MSDLC.EXE, is included with Microsoft LAN Manager
version 2.1a or later and can be installed with the additional information
provided in the Windows for Workgroups Resource Kit. MSDLC.EXE is supported
by the Microsoft LAN Manager support group.
<P>
The MSDLC protocol for Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 is available
from the Microsoft Download Service (MSDL) at (425) 936-6735. The
downloadable file is named WFWDLC.EXE. NOTE: The file WFWDLC.EXE is
intended for use with Windows For Workgroups version 3.11 only and is not
guaranteed to work with any other version of Workgroups.
<P>
Other versions of MSDLC.EXE are NOT available from the MSDL. The only way
to obtain this driver is to purchase the Microsoft LAN Manager product.
Microsoft LAN Manager licensing states that you may use the DLC driver with
an unlimited number of LAN Manager and Windows for Workgroups clients.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
For more information on using MSDLC.EXE, please refer to the "Windows
for Workgroups Resource Kit" guide, Appendix E, pages E-15 to E-18.
<P>
Extra! for Windows is manufactured by a vendor independent of Microsoft; we
make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
performance or reliability.
