The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the Microsoft mouse driver version 8.2 for MS-DOS (MOUSE.COM
or MOUSE.SYS which comes with Microsoft Windows operating system version
3.1) with Dell CMOS's system password set for "after boot," the computer
may hang after the password has been entered and any external command is
executed (any executable).
<P>
Dell has confirmed this to be a problem and is researching solutions.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Mouse Driver in AUTOEXEC.BAT</h3>
 
<P>
If the mouse driver is used in the AUTOEXEC.BAT
<P>
<PRE>   C:\WINDOWS\MOUSE.COM

</PRE>then after the computer starts and you enter your password, the system
will lock up after you press ENTER for any external command. This
problem will not occur for any internal command (DIR, CD, and so on).
<P>
Once the computer has locked up, pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL will not have
any effect.
<P>
<P><h3>Mouse Driver in CONFIG.SYS</h3>
 
<P>
If the mouse driver is used in the CONFIG.SYS file
<P>
<PRE>   DEVICE=C:\WINDOWS\MOUSE.SYS

</PRE>the system will lock up when you start the system and the mouse driver
will be reported as not loaded.
<P>
Note: At this point it will be necessary to start with a system disk
that also contains a CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT file.
<P>
If the system password is set to be activated "before boot," then the
problem does not exist.
<P>
<P><h3>How to Activate Dell CMOS Password</h3>
 
<P>
The Dell CMOS setup is activated by the following keys pressed
simultaneously:
<P>
<PRE>   CTRL+ALT+ENTER

</PRE>To get to the screen containing the password options, press the
following keys simultaneously:
<P>
<PRE>   ALT+N  (N = next screen)
