The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article contains a comprehensive list of documentation errors in
the Microsoft Windows Resource for version 3.0. This article covers:

<UL><LI>WRK Incorrectly Describes Maximizing Memory for MS-DOS Applications
<LI>Displaying SEA.BMP Bitmap Shipped with Windows Resource Kit
<LI>Windows Resource Kit Displays File Manager Incorrectly
<LI>WRK Says SETUP/P Instead of SETUP /P
<LI>No Current Application Note for SMARTDrive Available
<LI>Windows: Maximum Valid Size for .INI files
<LI>Windows Resource Kit: PIF.INF Does Not Exist
<LI>Redirecting One Parallel Port to Another
<P>
</UL>WRK Incorrectly Describes Maximizing Memory for MS-DOS Applications
 
<P>
On page 115 of the "Microsoft Windows Resource Kit" (WRK) guide, the
steps that explain how to free up memory for MS-DOS-based applications
apply to Windows-based applications, not to MS-DOS-based applications.
<P>
To increase the amount of memory available for an MS-DOS-based
application, clear any terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) programs,
unneeded drivers, and so on. (Eliminate all programs and drivers that
use and keep conventional memory before Windows loads.)
<P>
This information does not apply to later versions of Windows.
<P>
<P><h3>Displaying SEA.BMP Bitmap Shipped with Windows Resource Kit</h3>
 
<P>
The SEA.BMP file is a bitmap that comes with the Windows Resource Kit
(WRK) when you install the Windows 3.0 Fish program. Page 181 of the
"Microsoft Windows Resource Kit" guide shows how to set up the Windows
3.0 Fish program. However, step 13 simply states
<P>
<PRE>   13. SEA.BMP

</PRE>with no reference explaining how to display it as a bitmap for
Windows.
<P>
To display the SEA.BMP as wallpaper, refer to pages 155-156 in the
"Microsoft Windows User's Guide" for version 3.0. Also, the SEA.BMP is
displayed in the background example on page 181 of the "Windows
Resource Kit" guide.
<P>
<P><h3>Windows Resource Kit Displays File Manager Incorrectly</h3>
 
<P>
Page 184 of the "Microsoft Windows Resource Kit" incorrectly displays
a File Manager screen with open folders and split screen display.
Windows 3.0 File Manager cannot do this. This is a feature of Windows
3.1 File Manager.
<P>
<P><h3>WRK Says SETUP/P Instead of SETUP /P</h3>
 
<P>
In the "Reconstructing Main Accessories and Games Groups" section on
page 172 of the "Microsoft Windows Resource Kit" (WRK) guide for
Windows 3.0, the following message is discussed:
<P>
<PRE>   Group file XXXX.GRP is invalid or damaged; reconstruct the
   group

</PRE>In the next section, "Reconstruction Process," it incorrectly states
that the command to rebuild the Main, Accessories, and Games groups is
"SETUP/P" (without the quotation marks). The correct command is:
<P>
<PRE>   SETUP /P

</PRE>There must be a space after the word "SETUP" or the command will be
unsuccessful.
<P>
<P><h3>No Current Application Note for SMARTDrive Available</h3>
 
<P>
On page 103 of the "Microsoft Windows Resource Kit" (WRK) guide for
Windows 3.0, under the "Configuring Windows 3.0" section, there is a
documentation error referencing the "SMARTDrive Technical Data
Application Note" available from Microsoft Product Support Services.
<P>
The application note described here is a reference to an old
Application Note for Windows versions 2.x. This Application Note is no
longer available.
<P>
The most current information about SMARTDRV.SYS is in the "Microsoft
Windows User's Guide" for version 3.0, on pages 530-535 and 587-590.
<P>
<P><h3>Windows: Maximum Valid Size for .INI files</h3>
 
<P>
Page 89 of the "Microsoft Windows Resource Kit" (WRK) guide
incorrectly states that the maximum size of the WIN.INI file is 32K.
<P>
The maximum valid size for .INI files is 64K. If the WIN.INI file
exceeds 64K, the additional information will be ignored. This can
result in Windows behaving unpredictably (for example, system
configuration changes may not be implemented, fonts may be missing,
printer information may be missing, and default information from
applications may not be saved).
<P>
Some third-party applications may be unable to read .INI files,
including the WIN.INI file, if the INI files are larger than 32K.
<P>
<P><h3>Windows Resource Kit: PIF.INF Does Not Exist</h3>
 
<P>
Pages 108 and 109 of "The Microsoft Windows Resource Kit" for version
3.0 incorrectly states that the Windows 3.0 Setup program uses a file
called PIF.INF when setting up MS-DOS-based applications. The Setup
program actually uses the SETUP.INF file. Windows 3.0 does not contain
a file called PIF.INF.
<P>
<P><h3>Redirecting One Parallel Port to Another</h3>
 
<P>
The "Microsoft Windows Resource Kit" (WRK) guides for Windows version
3.0 provide erroneous examples of the MS-DOS MODE redirector command.
Page 98 (or page 108 for the guide without the Windows Resource Kit
update) for Windows 3.0 state the following:
<P>
<PRE>   ...if you have a physical LPT1, but not an LPT3, and you execute
   MODE LPT3=LPT1, output sent to LPT3 will be redirected to LPT1.

</PRE>The MS-DOS MODE command can be used to redirect output from a parallel
port to a serial communications port, but not to another parallel
port. The following is an example of a valid command:
<P>
<PRE>   MODE LPT1=COM1

</PRE>Redirecting output to a parallel port generates the following error
message:
<P>
<PRE>   Invalid Parameter - =LPTx

</PRE>A redirection of COM1 to LPT1 requires the use of a special buffer for
which the MODE command would have to allocate space. The MS-DOS MODE
command does not have this capability.
<P>
For more information on port redirection, query on the following words
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>  mode and redirect and port
