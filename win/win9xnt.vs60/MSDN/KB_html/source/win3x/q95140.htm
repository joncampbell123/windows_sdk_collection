</PRE><h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
 
<P>
This application note discusses why you cannot connect to a Novell
NetWare server from your Microsoft Windows for Workgroups workstation
if you have an ArcNet network adapter card (also known as a network
interface card, or NIC).
<P>
For your reference, a glossary of network-related terms is located at
the end of this document.
<P>
<P><h2>SUPPORTED PROTOCOLS AND NOVELL CONNECTIVITY</h2>
 
<P>
Windows for Workgroups primarily supports two network protocols:
NetBEUI (the protocol that Windows for Workgroups uses), and MSIPX, an
NDIS-compliant IPX protocol stack supplied by Microsoft that allows
Windows for Workgroups to communicate with Novell NetWare servers.
With NetBEUI and MSIPX loaded concurrently, you can connect to
NetBEUI- compliant servers and Novell NetWare servers from the same
Windows for Workgroups workstation. If you are using an ArcNet network
adapter card, however, this configuration does not work.
<P>
If you have an ArcNet card and you try to connect to a NetWare server
from your Windows for Workgroups workstation, you will receive the
following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   The network Novell NetWare cannot be added because Windows for
   Workgroups does not support this network with your ArcNet adapter.

</PRE>This error is caused by an incompatibility between the NetWare ArcNet
MAC driver and the Windows for Workgroups ArcNet MAC driver. This
incompatibility involves the packet fragmentation scheme Novell
NetWare uses to transmit ArcNet data packets.
<P>
<P><h3>NetBEUI Encapsulated Ethernet Packets</h3>
 
<P>
NetBEUI, which conforms to the NDIS standard, supports Ethernet and
token ring header formats, but not the ArcNet header format. NetBEUI
therefore needs a special way to handle data packets it sends or
receives across the ArcNet media. ArcNet provides a MAC driver that
supports the NetBEUI protocol. When a Windows for Workgroups server
sends data across the ArcNet media, NetBEUI attaches an Ethernet-type
header to the data. The ArcNet MAC driver recognizes this header type,
but before the data can travel on the ArcNet media, it needs to be
packaged with an ArcNet header. The ArcNet MAC driver performs this
function and sends the data packet across the media as an ArcNet
packet. On the receiving end, the reverse process occurs: the ArcNet
MAC driver receives the ArcNet data packet, replaces the ArcNet header
with an Ethernet-type header, and passes it to NetBEUI. NetBEUI
recognizes the packet and successfully passes it to the Windows for
Workgroups client workstation.
<P>
<P><h3>Novell IPX Packet Fragmentation</h3>
 
<P>
The maximum packet size for an ArcNet data packet is 507 bytes of data
following the header. The NetWare protocol requires a minimum data
packet size of 576 bytes, enabling reads and writes of 512 bytes of
data with 64 bytes of header information. Because of the difference in
size between ArcNet and Novell data packets, Novell defined a scheme
to transmit several consecutive ArcNet data packets in such a way that
they could be reconstructed at the receiver into one data packet. This
is referred to as packet fragmentation.
<P>
When a NetWare server sends data across the ArcNet media, the Novell
IPX protocol, which supports the ArcNet header format, fragments the
data and attaches a standard ArcNet header to each fragment. The
Novell ArcNet MAC driver then transmits these data packets over the
ArcNet media. When the packets are received at the Windows for
Workgroups client workstation, the Microsoft ArcNet MAC driver
converts the packet headers from ArcNet to Ethernet and passes them to
the MSIPX protocol stack. MSIPX doesn't use a packet fragmentation
scheme for Ethernet-type headers; therefore it assumes each packet
with a separate header is complete. Because this isn't the case, the
Windows for Workgroups client workstation can't interpret data sent by
a Novell NetWare server over the ArcNet media.
<P>
<P><h2>ARCNET NETWORK INTERFACE CARDS: MANUFACTURERS AND SUPPORT</h2>
 
<P>
There are currently two major manufacturers of ArcNet network cards:
Thomas Conrad (TC), and Standard Microsystems Corporation (SMC). Both
cards support the Novell NetWare IPX protocol and the LAN Manager
NetBEUI protocol. They support NetBEUI by using encapsulated Ethernet,
as described previously.
<P>
<P><h3>Standard Microsystems Corporation (SMC)</h3>
 
<P>
SMC cards are supported by Novell. (The PC130, PC220, and PS110 boards
are documented in the "Novell Standard Microsystems ArcNet
Supplement.")
<P>
The SMC ArcNet driver for NetWare ships with NetWare as the RX-Net
driver. The SMC ArcNet driver for LAN Manager was written by DWB
Associates and is now maintained directly by Microsoft.
<P>
<P><h3>Thomas Conrad (TC)</h3>
 
<P>
The TC ArcNet MAC drivers were written and are maintained by TC.
<P>
<P><h2>GLOSSARY</h2>
 
<P>
header: A block of bytes preceding the data that identifies the type
of data requesting transport across the network.
<P>
media access control (MAC) driver: MAC drivers, also known as network-
adapter-card drivers, communicate directly with the network adapter
card. The MAC driver moves incoming data from the network adapter card
to the protocol stack and vice versa.
<P>
Network Device Interface Specification (NDIS): This specification,
jointly developed by Microsoft and 3Com(R) in 1989, standardizes how
the MAC driver communicates bidirectionally with the protocol stack.
Prior to implementation of the NDIS standard, manufacturers of network
adapter cards had to provide the protocol stack and the MAC driver
functionality in one piece of software (called a monolithic stack).
The NDIS standard enables network adapter card vendors to simply
provide NDIS-conformant MAC drivers that are compatible with all NDIS-
conformant protocol stacks.
<P>
protocol stack: The protocol stack implements the set of procedural
rules, or protocols, used to communicate across the network.
