The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you install Windows version 3.1, Setup may return the following
error while trying to copy the SETUP.INF file from Disk 1 of the
Windows disks to the hard drive:
<P>
<PRE>   The version of the SETUP.INF file on your system is not valid for
   use with this version of SETUP.EXE. If you continue, Windows may
   not run properly. It is recommended that you quit Setup and then
   copy SETUP.INF from Windows disk number 1 to your Windows SYSTEM
   directory. Press ENTER to continue Setup. Press F3 to quit Setup now.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The above error message may be caused by one of the following:

<UL><LI>There is an earlier and possibly corrupt Windows version or
   incompatible OEM version of the SETUP.INF file on the hard disk. If
   MS-DOS version 5.0 is installed on the machine, type the following
   command from the drive C MS-DOS command prompt to search for other
   versions of this file:
<P>
<P><PRE>      dir setup.inf /s
</PRE><P>
   Rename any pre-existing SETUP.INF files that are found.

<LI>The SETUP.INF file is corrupt. Try copying the SETUP.INF file from
   Disk 1 to the Windows SYSTEM subdirectory. If the SETUP.INF file is
   damaged on the Setup disk, it will not copy successfully.

<LI>There is not enough memory on the machine to read the SETUP.INF
   file. This error message may be returned on systems having only
   640K base plus 1024K extended memory. Remove memory resident
   programs and devices from the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files and
   then try Setup again. Memory may need to be added to the machine
   before setting up Windows.
