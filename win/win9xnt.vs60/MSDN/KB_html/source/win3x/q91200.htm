<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Rooms or other physical items, such as a conference room or vehicle,
can be set up as a resource to be scheduled using Microsoft's
Schedule+ program included with Windows for Workgroups (WFWG).
<P>

scheduled.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Workgroups for Windows Mail Postoffice (WGPO) and Windows for
Workgroups Schedule+ must be installed and set up before beginning
this process.

<OL><P><LI>The Mail Postoffice administrator needs to create an account for the
   room. An example would be for the Conference room #1.

<P><LI>Create a mail account called CONFER1 for the Name and CONFER1 for
   the Mailbox. The password must be the same as the administrator's
   password for the Mail Postoffice.

<P><LI>Exit and sign out of Mail and Schedule+.

<P><LI>Rename the MSMAIL.MMF file in your local Windows directory.

<P><LI>Start Schedule+. When it prompts for a name and password, use
   CONFER1 as the name and enter the password. This starts the account
   for this room.

<P><LI>From the Schedule+ Options menu, choose General Options. Select
   This Account Is For A Resource, then chose OK.

<P><LI>If each person running Schedule+ is to have the ability to add
   and delete appointments for the room CONFER1, follow these steps.
   (If only one person will add or delete appointments, skip this step
   and go on to step 8.)

<P><LI>If there is to be only one person in charge of setting up
   and modifying the times for the room CONFER1, do the following:
<P>
   a. From the Options menu, choose Set Access Privileges.
   b. Set the default Privilege to "Read Appointments &amp; Tasks."
   c. Select the Add option and choose the person who is to be in
<P><PRE>      charge of making appointments to the room CONFER1.
</PRE>   d. Select the Assistant option for this person, then choose OK.
   e. Choose Exit and Sign Out from the File menu.
   f. From your local Windows directory, delete the MSMAIL.MMF file
<P><PRE>      that Schedule+ just created.
