The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you install Windows for Workgroups (WFWG) version 3.11 to a new
directory, and IPX.COM is running, the following message is displayed:
<P>
<PRE>   The files for IPX Support Driver (Monolithic) with NetBIOS
   transport are currently installed on your computer.

   Do you want to replace them with the version you are
   installing now?

   If you want to replace all later files with the version
   you are installing now, press Yes to All.

</PRE>This message is displayed even though you are installing Windows for
Workgroups to a new directory, and therefore do not have NetWare 3.x
workstation drivers installed that need to be updated.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
After Setup copies the NetWare files to your hard disk (including
VIPX.386), the SETUP.INF file instructs Setup to copy them once again. As a
result, Setup detects the files it just copied to your hard disk and
displays the message noted above.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows for Workgroups
version 3.11. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, choose Yes to update the files and continue
Setup. Although Setup does not actually update the files, it copies the
same version of VIPX.386 to your hard disk and then continues normally.
