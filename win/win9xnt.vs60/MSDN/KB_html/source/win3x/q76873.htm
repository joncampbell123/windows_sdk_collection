The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows with Multimedia Extensions version 1.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Multimedia PC specification was developed with several companies
in the computer industry. Listed below are those involved:

<UL><LI>Microsoft
<LI>Tandy
<LI>Fujitsu
<LI>CompuAdd
<LI>AT&amp;T
<LI>NEC Technologies
<LI>Olivetti
<LI>Headland Technology
<LI>MediaVision
<LI>Creative Labs
<P>
</UL>This article details the specification for the Multimedia PC label.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>CPU</h3>
 
<P>
Intel 80386sx minimum
<P>
<P><h3>RAM</h3>
 
<P>
2 megabytes of extended (linear address space) memory
<P>
<P><h3>Magnetic Storage</h3>
 
<P>
3.5-inch high-density (1.44) floppy disk drive
<P>
30 MB hard disk drive minimum
<P>
<P><h3>Optical Storage</h3>
 
<P>
CD-ROM drive with:

<UL><LI>Sustained 150K/second transfer rate
<LI>Average seek time of 1 second or less
<LI>10,000 hours MTBF
<LI>Mode 1 capability (mode 2 and form 1&amp;2 optional)
<LI>Subchannel Q (subchannels P and R-W optional)
<LI>MSCDEX 2.2 driver that implements the extended audio APIs
<P>
   The drive must be capable of maintaining a sustained transfer rate
   of 150K/second, without consuming more than 40 percent of the CPU
   bandwidth in the process. This requirement is for read block sizes
   no less than 16K and lead time of no more than is required to load
   the CD-ROM buffer with 1 read block of data. We recommend that the
   drive have on-board buffers of 64K and implement read-ahead
   buffering.
<P>
   If R-W support is provided, additional APIs must be implemented in
   the MSCDEX driver. Specifications for these additional APIs are
   available from Microsoft.
<P>
   Read-ahead buffering is described in a specification available from
   Microsoft.
<P>
</UL><h3>Audio</h3>
 
<P>
CD-ROM drive with CD-DA (Red Book) outputs and a front panel volume
control. As an option, CD-ROM XA may be provided.
<P>
8-bit (16-bit recommended) Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) with:

<UL><LI>Linear PCM sampling
<LI>DMA or FIFO buffered transfer capability with interrupt on
   buffer empty
<LI>22.05 and 11.025 kHz sample rate mandatory
<LI>44.1 kHz sampling rate desirable
<LI>Optional stereo channels
<LI>No more than 10 percent of the CPU bandwidth required to output
   11.025 or 22.05kHz: no more than 15 percent for 44.1kHz
<P>
</UL>8-bit (16-bit recommended) Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) with:

<UL><LI>Linear PCM sampling
<LI>11.025 kHz mandatory, (22.01kHz, or 44.1kHz sampling rate
   optional)
<LI>DMA or FIFO buffered capability with interrupt on buffer full
<LI>Microphone input
<P>
</UL>Internal synthesizer hardware with multivoice, multitimbral
capabilities, six simultaneous melody notes plus two simultaneous
percussive notes.
<P>
Internal mixing capabilities to combine input from three (recommended
four) sources and present the output as stereo, line-level audio
signal at the back panel.
<P>
<P><h3>Video</h3>
 
<P>
VGA compatible display adapter, and a color VGA compatible monitor.
<P>
<PRE>   A basic Multimedia PC uses mode 12h (640 x 480, 16 colors). An
   enhanced configuration referred to as "VGA+" is recommended with
   640 x 480, 256 colors.

   The recommended performance goal for VGA+ adapters is to be able to
   bit block transfer (bitblt) 1, 4, and 8 bit-par-pixel DOBs (device
   independent bitmaps) at 350K pixels/second given 100 percent of the
   CPU, and at 140K pixels/second given 40 percent of the CPU. This
   recommendation applies to run full-length encoded images and
   non-encoded images. The recommendation performance is needed to
   fully support high-performance applications such as synchronized
   audio-visual presentations.

</PRE><h3>User Input</h3>
 
<P>
Standard 101-key IBM-style keyboard with standard DIN connector.
<P>
Two button mouse with bus connector.
<P>
<P><h3>I/O</h3>
 
<P>
Standard 9-pin or 25-pin asynchronous serial port, programmable up to
9600 bits per second (BPS), switchable interrupt channel.
<P>
Standard 25-pin bidirectional parallel port with interrupt
capability.
<P>
1 MIDI port with In, Out and Thru, must have interrupt support for
input and FIFO transfer.
<P>
IBM-style analog or digital joystick port.
