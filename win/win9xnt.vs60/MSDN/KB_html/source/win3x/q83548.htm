The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.1, 3.11
<LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Windows version 3.1 Setup program fails while upgrading
from an earlier version of Windows, and one of the following messages
may be displayed:
<P>
<PRE>   Error loading

   -or-

   Error loading &lt;driver.drv&gt;

</PRE>where &lt;driver.drv&gt; is the name of the system driver identified in the
"SYSTEM.DRV=" line of the SYSTEM.INI file.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
An invalid or missing (blank) driver setting in the [boot] section of the
SYSTEM.INI file can cause the Setup program to fail during an upgrade.
<P>
Setup attempts to load drivers that end with the extension "DRV" that are
located in the [boot] section when Setup shifts to protected mode.
<P>
For example "SYSTEM.DRV=SYSTEM.DRV" is a valid setting for a driver.
<P>
Setup may also fail if the video driver settings are correct, but the
video card is not compatible with Windows 3.1. In this case, a message
similar to the following is displayed:
<P>
<PRE>   Error loading COMM.DRV

</PRE><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
The specific driver mentioned in the error message will vary. To
troubleshoot this problem, install Windows, selecting EGA for the
video graphics adapter. If the installation succeeds, then you have a
problem with your video card.
<P>
<P><h3>Successfully Upgrading</h3>
 
<P>
The following are steps to successfully upgrade an earlier version of
Microsoft Windows if the above errors are encountered:

<OL><P><LI>Edit the SYSTEM.INI file in the Windows directory.

<P><LI>Locate the [boot] section.

<P><LI>Change the SYSTEM.DRV= line to read as follows:
<P>
<P><PRE>      SYSTEM.DRV=SYSTEM.DRV
</PRE>
<P><LI>Restart the Setup program from the original Windows 3.1 system
   disks.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In addition to the above error messages, the following information is
recorded in the BOOTLOG.TXT file in the Windows directory:
<P>
<PRE>   [boot]
   LoadStart = DRIVER.DRV
   LoadFail = DRIVER.DRV Failure code is 02

</PRE></OL>If the SYSTEM.DRV setting is blank, the following information is recorded
in the BOOTLOG.TXT:
<P>
<PRE>   [boot]
   LoadStart =
   LoadFail =  Failure code is 02

</PRE>NOTE: The BOOTLOG.TXT file that records errors during setup is located in
the failed WINDOWS directory. This file can be viewed with a text editor
(such as the MS-DOS 5.0 Editor) or a word processor.
<P>
Besides SYSTEM.DRV, the following invalid or blank settings may also
cause an error during setup:
<P>
<PRE>   KEYBOARD.DRV=
   MOUSE.DRV=
   DISPLAY.DRV=
   COMM.DRV=
