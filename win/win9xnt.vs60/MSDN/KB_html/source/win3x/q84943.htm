<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a

<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Compaq Corporation has its own original equipment manufacturer (OEM)
version of the HIMEM.SYS extended memory manager called HIMEM.EXE, which is
included on the utilities disks that come with COMPA<B><A href="../vbwin/q80286.htm">Q 80286</A></B>-, 80386-, and
80486-based systems. Some of these computers are capable of supporting more
than 16 MB of RAM. These systems are equipped with the Extended Industry
Standard Architecture (EISA) bus.
<P>
These computer models include the following:
<P>
<PRE>   COMPAQ SYSTEMPRO
   COMPAQ DESKPRO 486/25
   COMPAQ DESKPRO 386/33L
   COMPAQ DESKPRO 486/33L

</PRE>Compaq's HIMEM.EXE driver allows those systems to access extended
memory using the Extended Memory Specification (XMS). It also allows
access to memory beyond 16 MB while allowing MS-DOS-based programs to
use the 64K region of memory located just above the 1 MB address.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
HIMEM.EXE, which supports more than 16 MB of memory, is intended to
replace HIMEM.SYS. However, Microsoft Windows operating system version
3.0 does not support more than 16 MB of RAM. If HIMEM.EXE is used with
Windows 3.0 on a system with more than 16 MB of RAM, data loss or
corruption may occur.
<P>
To avoid problems on COMPAQ systems with more than 16 MB RAM, make
sure to use the Windows 3.0 HIMEM.SYS driver rather than the COMPAQ
HIMEM.EXE driver. However, the version of HIMEM.EXE dated 6-14-90 will
work with Windows 3.0 and is recommended by Compaq for use on COMPAQ
machines with LESS than 16 MB of memory.
<P>
The HIMEM.SYS driver included with Windows 3.0 supports only 16 MB of
RAM. It automatically detects COMPAQ memory above 16 MB and prevents
access to that memory.
<P>
The HIMEM.EXE driver is installed in the CONFIG.SYS file instead of
the HIMEM.SYS driver. The DEVICE= line should read:
<P>
<PRE>   DEVICE=[drive:][path]HIMEM.EXE

</PRE>If the computer has more than 16 MB of extended memory, the "/ISAONLY"
switch should be added to the DEVICE= line, as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   DEVICE=[drive:][path]HIMEM.EXE /ISAONLY
