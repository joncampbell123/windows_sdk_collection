The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
To obtain the enhanced functionality of the dual network support of
LAN Manager 2.1 (dual support for LAN Manager 2.1 and NetWare) under
Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1, you must make some
modifications to your Windows installation.
<P>
The following details the settings that must appear in the SYSTEM.INI
file, and the specifics on the proper method to install dual network
support with Windows 3.1.
<P>
Windows 3.1 does not officially support any dual network driver.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
A proper installation of the dual network driver will make the
following entries in your SYSTEM.INI:
<P>
<PRE>   [boot]
   network.drv=dualnet.drv

   [boot description]
   network.drv=LAN Manager/Netware Dual Network

   [386Enh]
   network=*vnetbios,vdualnet.386,vipx.386,vnetware.386,vlanman.386

   [Netware]
   RestoreDrives=False
   NWShareHandles=True

</PRE><h3>Upgrading to 3.1 with Dual Network Support</h3>
 
<P>
If LAN Manager 2.1 has previously been installed for NetWare
connectivity with Windows 3.0, and the system is being upgraded to
Windows 3.1, the Setup program will not make any changes to the
network drivers. You will need to manually upgrade your NetWare
Windows components. These components are:
<P>
<PRE>   NETWARE.DRV
   VNETWARE.386
   VIPX.386
   NETWARE.HLP
   NWPOPUP.EXE (optional)
   NWPOPUP.HLP (optional)

</PRE>Additionally, you will need to upgrade your MS-DOS NetWare components.
These components are:
<P>
<PRE>   NETX.COM
   IPX.COM.

</PRE>You will need to use the Novell WSGEN or SHGEN programs to create an
IPX.COM from the IPX.OBJ supplied with Windows 3.1.
<P>
<P><h3>Installing Dual Network Support with 3.1</h3>
 
<P>
If you already have Windows 3.1 installed and want to install LAN
Manager 2.1 with NetWare connectivity (or add the NetWare connectivity
to your existing LAN Manager installation), use the LAN Manager Setup
program. This will copy the proper files and make the correct entries
in your SYSTEM.INI file. Make sure that the WSGEN or SHGEN disk you
use to generate a new IPX.COM and copy NETX.COM contains the updated
files (IPX.OBJ and NETX.COM) supplied with Windows 3.1.
<P>
<P><h3>Installing 3.1 on a Dual Network System</h3>
 
<P>
If you already are running LAN Manager 2.1 with NetWare connectivity
and want to install Windows 3.1, Windows will detect that you are
running LAN Manager 2.1 and install for that network only. After you
have completed installing Windows with support for LAN Manager 2.1,
you will need to run the NetWare connectivity Setup again from your
LAN Manager installation to upgrade your NetWare components and make
the necessary modifications to your SYSTEM.INI file (see section above
for more information).
