<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Tandy Corporation has a Microsoft Windows 3.1 compatible sound driver
designed to take advantage of the Digital Audio Circuitry (DAC) sound
chip found in several Tandy computers.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Tandy manufactures a line of computers that use a DAC chip for playing
and recording sound. The DAC chip offers higher performance sound
generation than the standard PC Speaker sound driver. This driver can
play and create .WAV files on the following Tandy machines:
<P>
<PRE>   2500XL       2500SX25
   2500XL/2     1000RSX
   2500SX       2500RSX
   2500SX20     2500SX/33

</PRE>NOTE: The 2500RSX computer can play .WAV files but cannot create them
because it does not have an MIC port.
<P>
Files included with the Tandy sound driver are as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   TDACWAVE.DRV     9040  11-05-92  1:52P
   OEMSETUP.INF     1785  11-05-92  1:48P
   READ.ME          1302  11-05-92  1:18P

</PRE>Below is the text of the READ.ME file that comes with the Tandy sound
driver.
<P>
<P><h3>READ.ME</h3>
 
<P>
To install TDACWAVE.DRV as a Windows 3.1 sound driver:

<OL><P><LI>Run Windows 3.1.

<P><LI>Run the Control Panel from the Main group.

<P><LI>Choose the Drivers icon.

<P><LI>Choose the Add button.

<P><LI>In the List of Drivers box, select Add Unlisted or Updated Driver
   and then choose the OK button.

<P><LI>Insert this disk into a drive and, if necessary, change the drive
   name displayed in the dialog box to the drive name containing this
   disk.

<P><LI>Choose the OK button.

<P><LI>Select Tandy DAC Wave from the list and choose the OK button.
<P>
</OL>Advanced installation notes:
<P>
TDACWAVE.DRV supports a section in the SYSTEM.INI file titled
[TDACWAVE.DRV]. This section may have any or none of the following
parameters
<P>
<PRE>   port=
   int=
   dmachannel=

</PRE></OL>where the port is a hexadecimal value, int is the IRQ setting in
decimal, and dmachannel is the DMA channel in decimal.
<P>
If port is not specified, the driver attempts to obtain this value from
a BIOS call. If dmachannel is not specified, the driver defaults to DMA
Channel 1. If int is not specified, the driver defaults to interrupt 7.
<P>
Note that TDACWAVE.DRV does not create the [TDACWAVE.DRV] section. If the
system needs to override the driver's default values for any of the above
parameters, the SYSTEM.INI file must be manually edited.
<P>
Contact your local Radio Shack store or Radio Shack Computer Support
Services for technical support or to obtain the driver disk.
<P>
The Tandy Sound Driver is manufactured by Tandy Corporation, a vendor
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise,
regarding this product's performance or reliability.
