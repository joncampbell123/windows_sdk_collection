<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Hewlett-Packard (HP) Intellifont-for-Windows 3.0 is a font utility package
that provides scalable screen fonts to match available printer fonts used
on the HP LaserJet III and IIID printers. The package also includes a PCL 5
printer driver for use with Windows 3.0.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
HP Intellifont-for-Windows 3.0 package adds the following to your Windows
3.0 setup:

<UL><LI>HP Intellifont-for-Windows 3.0 application icon
<LI>Intellifont screen font driver: for automatic on-the-fly screen
   fonts
<LI>Eight scalable typefaces: from the CG Times and Univers families
<LI>HP Font Installer: for scalable typefaces and bitmapped printer
   fonts
<LI>PCL 5 Printer Driver: for HP LaserJet III and IIID printers
<LI>Help files: for quick information
<P>
</UL><h3>Screen Font Driver</h3>
 
<P>
HP Intellifont-for-Windows 3.0 includes a screen-font driver that
automatically creates screen fonts from scalable typeface files at all
point sizes supported by Windows 3.0. The screen fonts are created "on-the-
fly," eliminating the need to use memory for traditional bitmapped screen
fonts. The HP Intellifont-for-Windows 3.0 screen font driver can only
create scalable screen fonts for scalable typeface products. Windows 3.0
displays representative screen fonts for other kinds of fonts.
<P>
<P><h3>Eight Scalable Typefaces</h3>
 
<P>
Eight scalable typefaces from the CG Times and Univers families are
included with HP Intellifont-for-Windows 3.0. These typefaces match the
resident typefaces in the HP LaserJet III and IIID printers and are the
source of scalable screen fonts. Both typefaces are available in regular,
bold, italic, and bold italic styles. Optional typefaces are available from
HP.
<P>
<P><h3>HP Font Installer and Compatible Fonts</h3>
 
<P>
Using the HP Font Installer, you can install the following font products
for use in Windows 3.0:

<UL><LI>Scalable typefaces
<LI>Bitmapped printer fonts: cartridge or disk-based (soft)
<LI>Scalable printer fonts: through AutoFont Support utilities
<LI>Printer Cartridge Metric (.PCM) files
<P>
</UL>Disk-based (soft) bitmapped printer fonts must be in PCL format for HP
LaserJet printers. Scalable typeface products must be in AGFA
Compugraphic's FAIS format. All other font products require AutoFont
Support files or .PCM files.
<P>
<P><h3>PCL 5 Printer Driver</h3>
 
<P>
HP Intellifont-for-Windows 3.0 includes an upgraded PCL 5 printer
driver. The new driver (version 3.77) allows selections for: printer
model, paper source (tray), paper size, printer memory size, Page
Protection status, orientation, installed font cartridges, graphics
resolution, gray scale, and number of copies. The PCL 5 Printer Driver
contains special code that allows Windows 3.00 software applications to
access the advanced features of the HP LaserJet III and IIID printers
such as: pattern shades; multiple print directions on a single page;
and mirrored, shadowed, and reverse (white on black) printing.
<P>
To improve graphic image printing, three new gray scale settings are
available. Try printing your graphics with the different gray scale
settings to choose the one that looks best to you.
<P>
<P><h3>Help Files</h3>
 
<P>
Updated online help information is supplied for the new HP Intellifont-for-
Windows 3.0 icon, PCL 5 Printer Driver, and HP Font Installer windows. Help
files contain step-by-step procedures for installing accessory typeface and
font products along with definitions
of terms.
<P>
Use Help any time you need to review a procedure (remember, with Windows
3.0, you can print a help topic any time).
