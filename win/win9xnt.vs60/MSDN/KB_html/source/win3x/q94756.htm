The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The LMLogon= setting in the [network] section of the SYSTEM.INI file
determines functionality in Windows for Workgroups and Workgroup
Connections with a LAN Manager Domain.
<P>
Workgroup Connections requires the LMLogon=YES switch for
functionality. This is different from the way Control Panel in Windows
for Workgroups adds this switch. Any modifications made through the
Control Panel Network interface within Windows for Workgroups set the
LMLogon value to Zero (0) or one (1).
<P>
There is a problem when this setting is equal to "YES" (altered by
Workgroup Connections). The LAN Manager Settings dialog box in the
Windows for Workgroups Control Panel, Network, Networks Options, does
not show Log On To LAN Manager Domain as selected. In other words, the
check box appears to not be selected. However, Windows for Workgroups
behaves as if the Log On To LAN Manager Domain is selected.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The LAN Manager Settings dialog box in Control Panel, Network,
Networks Options, Settings does not display a check in the box next to
Log On To LAN Manager Domain if LMLogon=YES is specified in the
[network] section of the SYSTEM.INI file. If this box is selected in
Control Panel, the SYSTEM.INI setting are changed to LMLogon=1 and LAN
Manager validation is enabled.
<P>
It is possible to be logged on and validated by a LAN Manager server
that is password protected and never be prompted for a password. This
can  happen if you are using LAN Manager validation and either
LMLogon=1 or LMLogon=YES. However if you are using LMLogon=YES,
Control Panel never indicates that LAN Manager has been loaded. This
can make it seem as if Windows for Workgroups is allowing unsecured
access to a secure server. In actuality, you have been properly
validated and the password is part of the password cache.
<P>
It is also possible to never type in a password, not even a Windows
for Workgroups password, and have access to a LAN Manager server that
is password protected. In this situation, the Windows for Workgroups
password was originally entered as null (enter key), then password
caching was selected, and at some point the LAN Manager password was
typed in and recorded as part of the cache. With validation turned on
and LMLogon=1 or LMLogon=YES, you can gain access to the server
without typing any password. As above, you would receive no indication
that LAN Manager had been loaded if LMLogon=YES.
<P>
NOTE: When null is entered as the Windows for Workgroups password, the
prompt to logon to Windows for Workgroups is bypassed.
