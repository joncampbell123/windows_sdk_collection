The information in this article applies to:
<P>
Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11
 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
It may be necessary to force the mounting of VFAT on hard disk drives that
are not detected as 32-bit disk access volumes and volumes that are
compressed. Under normal circumstances, the only type of drive volumes that
are not detected as 32-bit disk access volumes are SCSI and ESDI drives. In
the case of compression (DoubleSpace version 6.2, DriveSpace, or Stacker
version 3.1), extra processing of the INT 21h calls is required before the
INT 13h call can occur. (DoubleSpace version 6.0 does not allow the
mounting of VFAT.)
<P>
RMM.D32 is the real-mode-mapper component that allows VFAT to mount on non-
32-bit disk access volumes and compressed volumes. If 32-bit file access is
enabled on one of these volumes, the following changes are made to the
SYSTEM.INI file by Windows for Workgroups 3.11:
<P>
<PRE>   [386Enh]
   device=ios.386
   device=vxdldr.386

</PRE>IOS.386 replaces the *BLOCKDEV component of a 32-bit disk access volume,
and VXDLDR.386 loads the RMM.D32 real-mode mapper. RMM.D32 does not appear
in the SYSTEM.INI file because it is a component of another Windows for
Workgroups file and is loaded during Windows startup by VXDLDR.386.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When a compressed drive or a non-32-bit disk access volume exists but is
not properly detected, you may need to force the loading of the real-mode
mapper, RMM.D32. To do this, add the following line to the [386Enh] section
of the SYSTEM.INI file:
<P>
<PRE>   ForceMapper=C

   -or-

   ForceMapper=CD

</PRE>Use the second example to force multiple drives to use the RMM.D32 mapper.
Put drive letters that represent each drive on your system, and do not
separate the letters with commas.
