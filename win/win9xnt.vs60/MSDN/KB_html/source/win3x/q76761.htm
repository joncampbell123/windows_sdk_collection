The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows with Multimedia Extensions version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The following information is contained in the Multimedia Extensions
version 1.0 WUGNET.TXT file. The Setup program copies this file to the
Windows with Multimedia Extensions directory.
<P>
This information does not apply to later versions of Windows.
<P>
 
<P><h3>WUGNET.TXT ONLINE DOCUMENT</h3>
 
<P>
<P><h2>PUTTING WINDOWS ON A NETWORK</h2>
 
<P>
This file is intended for system administrators or anyone who will
install Windows on a network to be shared by multiple users.
<P>
The Microsoft License Agreement that came with your Windows package
gives you permission to install Windows on a network. For information
on this license, see the Grant of License section of this agreement or
contact the Microsoft Information Center.
<P>
The files on the CD-ROM may be compressed. To  put Windows with
Multimedia Extensions on the network, you must decompress these files
by using the Expand decompression program that is included with
Windows. To operate Expand efficiently, you will need to create an
MS-DOS batch file. The following procedure contains the commands
necessary to create this batch file.
<P>
This procedure assumes you are copying Windows from the CD-ROM in
CD-ROM drive L to the \\WINDOWS network directory on network disk
drive W and that you must decompress these files. You should replace
the pathnames in these examples with the actual ones you are using,
where appropriate.
<P>
<P><h3>To Install Windows on a Network:</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Connect to the network.

<P><LI>Change to the directory where you want to put the shared copy of
   Windows.

<P><LI>Type copy con expall.bat at the DOS prompt.
<P>
   This DOS command means that what you type next will be copied into
   EXBALL.BAT batch file. You can use any filename for this batch file
   as long as it contains the .BAT extension.

<P><LI>Type the following at the DOS prompt
<P>
<P><PRE>      l:
      for %%i in (*.*) do w:\windows\expand %%i w:\windows\%%i
      w:
</PRE><P>
   This MS-DOS code creates a program that will allow you to enter the
   pathnames of the source and destination of the Windows files.

<P><LI>At the DOS prompt, press CTRL+Z.
<P>
   This MS-DOS command closes the batch files.

<P><LI>Insert the CD-ROM into drive L and type the following at the DOS
   prompt:
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy l:expand.exe w:\windows
</PRE><P>
   The Expand decompression program is copied to your network Windows
   directory.

<P><LI>Now type the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      expall l:*.* w:\windows
</PRE><P>
   This command will run the EXPALL batch file program, which copies
   and expands the files from the Windows disks to the Windows
   directory on network disk drive W. You should enter the network
   disk drive and directory of your choice.

<P><LI>Make all Windows files and the network share read-only.
<P>
</OL>Users may now connect to this directory and run Setup.
<P>
<P><h2>Giving Users Access to Network Applications</h2>
 
<P>
You can give users easier access to applications running on the
network by modifying the SETUP.INF file when you put Windows on the
network. This text file is included with windows and remains in the
shared windows directory.
<P>
Windows setup uses this file, among other reasons, to determine the
initial contents of the user's Program Manager groups. By modifying
the file, you can add applications to these groups and customize their
settings.
<P>
The [progman.groups] section of SETUP.INF lists the groups in the
Program Manager window. Following this section is a list of the
applications that are displayed as icons in each group when a user
starts Windows. Each application is listed by title, pathname, icon
filename, and icon number. These fields are separated by commas. The
icon fields are optional.
<P>
If you want Windows to install an application that is on the network
and place it in the user's Program Manager window, you need to add to
SETUP.INF a title (of your choice) and the pathname of that
application.
<P>
You have the option of specifying which icon will be displayed by
including  an icon filename and/or an icon number.
<P>
The icon filename identifies the file that contains the icon you want
to use. If you want to use an icon that is assigned to another
application, you can enter that application's filename as the icon
filename. If you don't specify an icon filename, the displayed icon
will be one from the application file. Or, if the application file
does not contain any icons, the icon will come from Program Manager.
<P>
If the file you select contains more than one icon, you can specify
the one you want to use by entering the appropriate icon number. This
number corresponds to the order in which the icon is listed in the
file. If you do not enter an icon number, Program Manager will use the
first icon listed in the file.
<P>
<P><h3>To Add a Network Application to a User's Program Manager Window</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Open the SETUP.INF file by using Write.

<P><LI>Choose the No Conversion option in the Write dialog box.

<P><LI>In the section for the group where you want the application to
   appear, type the program title, pathname, and, optionally, the icon
   filename and icon number of the application. The fields must be
   separated by commas.

<P><LI>Choose Save from the File menu to save the changes.
<P>
</OL>The following are examples of different entries that you could put in
SETUP.INF if you wanted to add a shared copy of Microsoft Word to a
user's Program Manager window.
<P>
<PRE>   "Microsoft Word",k:\word\word.exe

   "Microsoft Word",k:\word\word.exe,progman.exe

   "Microsoft Word",k:\word\word.exe,,2

   "Microsoft Word",k:\word\word.exe,progman.exe,2

</PRE></OL><h2>Keeping a User's Files Off a Shared Directory</h2>
 
<P>
When a user runs an application, Program Manager changes the user's
directory to the one that contains the application. As a result, a
user running a shared application from the network might accidentally
leave personal files in the shared directory. These files will use up
disk space and possibly interfere with other users.
<P>
You can avoid this problem when you add the application to SETUP.INF.
First, make sure the application is located on the user's path. Then,
instead of typing the network pathname for the application, type the
user's personal Windows directory followed by the application
filename.
<P>
For example, if EXCEL.EXE is located in K:\APPS, and that directory is
in the user's path, type c:\excel.exe in SETUP.INF. Then, when the
user selects the Excel icon, Windows will change to the user's
directory (C:\) and run Microsoft Excel from the user's path. Any
document files the user creates will stay in the user's directory
rather than in the shared network directory.
<P>
<P><h2>Putting Additional Network Files on a User's System</h2>
 
<P>
When a user runs the network version of Setup, Windows will copy
selected files to the user's system. You can copy additional files to
the user's Windows directory by adding the filenames to the [net]
section of the user's SETUP.INF file.
<P>
<P><h3>To Put Additional Files in the User's Windows Directory</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Open the SETUP.INF file by using a text editor, such as Notepad.

<P><LI>find the [net] section of the file. (If you are using Notepad, you
   can do this by choosing Find from the Search menu, type [net], and
   choosing OK.)

<P><LI>Type a drive number, a colon, the filename, and a title (optional)
   for the file you want to copy.
<P>
   You must enter a drive number, but it does not matter what number
   you use. Include a title only if you want a message to appear
   during Setup that indicates when this file is being copied to the
   user's disk.
<P>
</OL>The following are acceptable entries in the [net] section of
SETUP.INF:
<P>
<PRE>   2:NEW.PIF

   2:NEW.PIF, "Network Application Settings"
