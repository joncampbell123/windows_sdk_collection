The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In Windows for Workgroups, Print Manager manages all local and remote print
jobs except for those from local MS-DOS-based applications. A conflict
arises if a remote client sends a print job at the same time an MS-DOS-
based application is printing.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Because Print Manager does not control local MS-DOS-generated print jobs
and MS-DOS-based programs usually do not close printer ports when their
print jobs are complete, the redirector must use the MS-DOS-based
application's idle time to determine when to print the remote print job. In
Windows for Workgroups version 3.11, this value is specified using the
PRINTBUFTIME= statement both in the [network] section of SYSTEM.INI and in
the [ifsmgr] section of the SYSTEM.INI file on the client machine.  The
entry in the [network] section controls network printing timeout using the
real-mode redirector (outside of Windows), while the entry in the [ifsmgr]
section controls network printing timeout using the protected-mode
redirector (within Windows). By default, this value is set to 45 seconds.
<P>
NOTE: Windows for Workgroups Setup does not add the [ifsmgr] section; this
section may have to be added manually.
<P>
If the above situation occurs, you are warned that a potential device
conflict exists, and, if you continue, the printed output may be incorrect
or garbled. The local (print server) print job goes directly to the port,
breaking up and potentially interrupting the remote print job.
<P>
If you have a shared printer on your machine, do not override a device
conflict warning. You may be able to work around this problem by setting
PRINTBUFTIME= to a lower value (such as 10 seconds).
