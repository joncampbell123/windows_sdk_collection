The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
The following article contains information on the use of Windows for
Workgroups with third-party products or configurations that have not
been tested and are not supported by Microsoft.
<P>
If the steps or procedures described in this article do not function
properly, contact the manufacturer of the third-party product for more
information or use a supported configuration.
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The Standard Microsystems Corporation (SMC) network interface card
driver (SMCMAC.DOS), which is included with Windows for Workgroups
version 3.1, does not support using two SMC network cards at the same
time. Windows for Workgroups does not display a warning message and
will allow setup for two SMC network cards. If two SMC network cards
are set up with the SMCMAC.DOS driver, the following error message
appears when you start the machine:
<P>
<PRE>   Error 5733: The protocol manager has reported an incomplete binding.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This is a limitation with the SMCMAC.DOS NDIS driver and applies to
both Microsoft LAN Manager and Windows for Workgroups. SMC has a
workaround for this limitation for Microsoft LAN Manager, and it
should also work with Windows for Workgroups.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around the limitation, use the following steps.

<OL><P><LI>Obtain the self extracting archive file NDS119.EXE, from either the
   SMC forum on CompuServe or directly from SMC. This file contains
   another NDIS driver for the second network card.

<P><LI>Run the NDS119.EXE file and once the files have been extracted,
   copy the file SMCMAC2.DOS to your Windows for Workgroups directory.

<P><LI>Start Windows for Workgroups and open the Control Panel from the
   Main group and select Network, Adapters.

<P><LI>If there are already two drivers installed for the SMC network
   cards, then exit Windows and skip to step 6. Otherwise, choose Add.

<P><LI>Select an appropriate network card driver for the second SMC
   network card, configure the correct settings for the card, and
   choose Restart Computer when prompted.

<P><LI>Edit the CONFIG.SYS file and add any of the following lines if
   they are not present, or modify any lines that need to be, so they
   match the below lines:
<P>
<P><PRE>      DEVICE=&lt;Windows Path&gt;\PROTMAN.DOS /I:&lt;Windows Path&gt;
      DEVICE=&lt;Windows Path&gt;\SMCMAC.DOS
      DEVICE=&lt;Windows Path&gt;\SMCMAC2.DOS
      DEVICE=&lt;Windows Path&gt;\WORKGRP.SYS
</PRE>
<P><LI>Restart the computer by turning it off and on.
<P>
   NOTE: The SMCMAC2.DOS driver is written so that it may require
   the computer be restarted to properly initialize.
<P>
