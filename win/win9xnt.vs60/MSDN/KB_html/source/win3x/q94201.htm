The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The TopDesk program included with the Windows Resource Kit for Windows
version 3.1 prevents many of the Sound Events included with Microsoft
SoundBits from functioning correctly. Closing TopDesk allows all of
the Sound Events to operate normally.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft SoundBits includes a Sound Events "hook," which allows
Windows' users to attach sounds to specific system events, such as
minimizing and maximizing Windows, opening and closing applications,
and starting and exiting Windows. Under normal circumstances, this
"hook" plays whatever sound is assigned to a system event when that
event occurs.
<P>
If TopDesk is running, however, sounds will not play when certain
system events occur. Among the Sound Events that DO NOT function with
TopDesk are the following:
<P>
<PRE>   Application Maximize
   Application Minimize
   Application Open
   Application Restore Down
   Application Restore Up
   Control Panel Minimize
   Control Panel Open
   Control Panel Restore Up
   File Manager Minimize
   File Manager Open
   File Manager Restore Up
   MBrowser Minimize
   MBrowser Open
   MBrowser Restore Up
   Program Manager Minimize
   Program Manager Restore Up
   Sound Recorder Open
   WinHelp Minimize
   WinHelp Open
   WinHelp Restore Up

</PRE>The only way to allow these Sound Events to operate correctly is to
close TopDesk.
