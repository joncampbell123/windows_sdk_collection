The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups, version 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
NOTE: Microsoft does not encourage nor support user changes to .INF files;
therefore, Microsoft Product Support Services (PSS) does not support the
procedure in this article. Although we have tested the following procedure
and it appears to function as described; we strongly recommend that you
make a backup copy of your .INF file before you proceed.
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
It is possible to install an unsupported modem for use with RAS only, even
though the modem does not appear on the list of supported communications
devices. Although not tested by Microsoft, many devices can operate
satisfactorily. To set up an unsupported modem for RAS, it may be necessary
to edit the MODEM.INF file or to choose an emulation. This article provides
an example to guide you through this process.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The parameters for your modem can be substituted for the parameters in the
example below.
<P>
<P><h3>Example</h3>
 
<P>
You are using a Macronix Stealth 144 modem, which is not included on the
list of approved modems. After trying to install the Stealth 144 as a
different Macronix modem (such as the Maxlite Fax 9696 or the VOMAX 2000),
the modem still does not work correctly.
<P>
Because most modems are Hayes compatible, configure your modem as a Hayes
Compatible 9600. If it works correctly, you can edit the MODEM.INF file to
include an option for your modem. Use the following steps to do this:

<OL><P><LI>Back up the existing MODEM.INF file. Then open the MODEM.INF file in
   your Windows SYSTEM subdirectory, and search for the heading [Hayes
   Compatible 9600]. Select the entire section and choose Copy from the
   Edit menu.
<P>
   The section appears similar to the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      [Hayes Compatible 9600]
      &lt;speaker_on&gt;=M1
      &lt;speaker_off&gt;=M0
      &lt;autodial_on&gt;=ATDT
      &lt;autodial_off&gt;=ATX3D
      CALLBACKTIME=10
      DEFAULTOFF=compression
      MAXCARRIERBPS=9600
      MAXCONNECTBPS=9600
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      COMMAND_INIT=AT&amp;F&amp;C1&amp;D2 V1 S0=0 S2=128 S7=55&lt;speaker&gt;&lt;cr&gt;
      COMMAND_DIAL=&lt;autodial&gt;&lt;phonenumber&gt;&lt;cr&gt;
      COMMAND_LISTEN=ATS0=1&lt;cr&gt;
</PRE>
<P><LI>Move to the end of MODEM.INF. From the Edit menu, choose Paste so that
   the Hayes information can easily be found later. Change the heading on
   the pasted information from [Hayes Compatible 9600] to [Macronix Stealth
   144].

<P><LI>The Stealth 144 is a 14,400 baud modem; however, because of software or
   hardware compression, it is possible to connect at a higher rate. You
   can modify the information pasted in step 2 so that the modem attempts
   to connect at 19,200.
<P>
   The MAXCARRIERBPS= is the maximum baud rate for this modem. Change this
   from 9600 to 19200. The MAXCONNECTBPS= is the baud rate at which
   negotiating (training) begins when the modem is connected. If the two
   modems cannot talk at this rate, lower rates are automatically tried
   until a baud rate at which both modems can operate is found. Change
   MAXCONNECTBPS= from 9600 to 19200.

<P><LI>Load RAS. Choose Setup, then choose Configuration. The new modem should
   now appear under Device. Select it and restart RAS to load the
   information for the new modem.
<P>
   When you install a RAS modem, the installation program reads the
   MODEM.INF file, parses the information for that particular modem, and
   writes part of it to the SERIAL.INI file. When RAS is loaded, it reads
   both the SERIAL.INI and MODEM.INF files. Therefore, after making any
   changes to the MODEM.INF file, reinstall the modem.
<P>
</OL>If this procedure does not work properly, restore the backup copy of
MODEM.INF. For more information, search on the word "script" in RAS Help.
