<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you install a network adapter card, sound card, or other hardware
adapter, you typically have to choose an input/output (I/O) base address.
If the base address you choose for your network adapter card is currently
being used by another hardware adapter card, Protocol Manager may report an
unsuccessful binding, or your system may stop responding (hang).
<P>
This article provides a list of I/O base addresses that may already be in
use on your system and what hardware devices use them.
<P>
NOTE: Most network adapter cards have the default I/O base address 300.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The I/O base address for each hardware adapter card installed on your
system must be unique to avoid potential problems. Before you install your
network adapter card, you should know which I/O base addresses are
currently in use by existing hardware adapter cards installed in your
system. I/O base addresses are typically set using jumpers on the card or
using a software configuration program in EPROM.
<P>
The following list shows I/O base address ranges commonly used by hardware
devices (other than network adapter cards) and what I/O base address they
would conflict with.
<P>
The I/O base address list does not list all available I/O base address. In
addition, some of these addresses may not be supported by your network
adapter card. For more information on I/O base addresses supported by your
network adapter card, consult your hardware documentation or contact the
network adapter card vendor.
<P>
Potential conflicting devices and their I/O base addresses:

</PRE>NOTE: Some video cards use I/O base address 320. If you are using I/O base
address 320 for your network adapter card and are experiencing problems,
try a different I/O base address.
<P>
* These addresses are for older PS/2 computers. ISA computers use the
<PRE>  following address ranges:

     Device   Range Used
     -------------------
     LPT1:    378-37F
     LPT2:    278-27F
     LPT3:    3BC-3BF
