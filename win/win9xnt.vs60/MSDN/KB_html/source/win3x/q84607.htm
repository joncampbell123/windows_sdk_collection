The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When installing Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1, you may get
the "Setup is unable to copy the file win.src..." or "Setup Error #5 -
Setup either cannot open or cannot create the file CPWIN386.CPL..." message
if you have a RAM drive that is assigned to logical drive C. Booting
without the RAM drive or running a custom installation will allow you to
complete the Windows 3.1 Setup program.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Setup may fail on the first file it attempts to copy if you run Setup
from a network drive, and if the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>No hard drive is installed.
<LI>A RAM drive is installed and is assigned to logical drive C.
<LI>Setup is executed from the directory where all Windows files
   reside.
<LI>Express install is selected.
<P>
</UL>When the Setup /N command is executed under these circumstances, you
may get the message:
<P>
<PRE>   Setup is unable to copy the file win.src.

</PRE>This file already exists in the destination directory and is marked
read-only.
<P>
You must remove the read-only attributes from all files in your
Windows directory to successfully complete Windows Setup.
<P>
When "Setup" is executed under the same circumstances, you may get the
message:
<P>
<PRE>   Setup Error #5

   Setup either cannot open or cannot create the file CPWIN386.CPL,
   which is needed to set up Windows. Setup cannot continue.

</PRE>Any one of the following will allow you to complete Windows Setup:

<OL><P><LI>Choose Custom install instead of Express install.
<P>
   -or-

<P><LI>Remark out the RAM drive from the CONFIG.SYS file, by placing REM
   before the RAM drive entry, and then restart the system.
<P>
   -or-

<P><LI>Create the directory into which you would like to install Windows,
   then run Setup from this directory. For example, if you would like
   to set up Windows 3.1 in Y:\WINDOWS and all of the Windows files
   are in Y:\WINSETUP, change your current directory to Y:\WINDOWS
   after creating it. Then type Y:\WINSETUP\SETUP.EXE.
