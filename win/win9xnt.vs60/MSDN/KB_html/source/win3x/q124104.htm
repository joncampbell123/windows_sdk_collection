<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you delete a program item icon from a Program Manager group, if you
hold down the left (primary) mouse button while you press the DEL key, the
following message is displayed:
<P>
<PRE>   Are you sure you want to delete the group &lt;groupname&gt;?

</PRE>If you choose Yes, the icon is deleted. However, the moment you move the
mouse pointer into the group window, the next program item icon attaches to
the pointer as if a drag function is being performed, even if the mouse
button is not being held down. Program Manager continues in this drag mode
until you click or release the mouse button. At that point, it drops the
icon at the current location, as long as it is valid; otherwise, it is
dropped into its original group.
<P>
If you choose No, the screen returns to normal; however, the moment you
move the pointer into the group window, the item icon that had been
selected attaches to the pointer as if a drag function is being performed,
even if the mouse button is not held down. Program Manager continues in
this drag mode until you click or release the mouse button. At that point,
it drops the icon at the current location, as long as it is valid;
otherwise, it is dropped into its original group.
<P>
If the group is empty, the deletion works correctly.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows for Workgroups
versions 3.10 and 3.11. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
At this time, no workaround is available.
