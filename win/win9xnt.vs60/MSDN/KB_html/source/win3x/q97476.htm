<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you set up Windows with an ATI Ultra Pro video board, Setup may
automatically detect the video board as an 8514 adapter. Setup may
stop responding (hang) when it actually starts Windows (a gray screen
is displayed at this point) if the board is set up incorrectly.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
According to ATI Technologies, the ATI Ultra Pro video card, which
uses the Mach 32 chip set, is fully compatible with the IBM 8514
adapter and should work with the Windows 8514 video driver if set up
properly.
<P>
Windows hangs if the video card is set up incorrectly. When you set up
the Mach 32 board with the installation program, you use the Set
Power-Up Configuration option. In the Set Power-Up Configuration
dialog box, you set the VGA Memory Size option. This option tells the
card how much memory to dedicate for the VGA portion of the adapter.
<P>
According to ATI Technical Support, it is a common mistake to set up
this option to use all the memory on the adapter. Doing so causes
Windows to hang if you are using an 8514 driver. This option should be
set to half the total memory on the board (which is usually 512
kilobytes [K] because most Mach 32 boards come with 1 megabyte [MB] of
VRAM. The configuration can also be set to "Shared," which allows VGA
and 8514 programs to share the VRAM on the card; however, this setting
may not always correct the problem. Specifying the amount of memory is
the most reliable way to ensure Windows does not hang.
<P>
