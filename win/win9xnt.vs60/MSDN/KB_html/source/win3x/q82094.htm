The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The MREADME.DOC file on the Setup disk for Microsoft Mouse driver disk
version 7.04 incorrectly states that the MOUSE.DRV file on the Mouse
disk should be copied onto the Microsoft Windows original disks before you
install Windows.
<P>
The MOUSE.DRV on the Microsoft Mouse disk is a mouse driver for Windows
versions 2.x. Running this driver with Microsoft Windows versions 3.0 and
later causes Windows to stop responding (hang or crash) in standard and 386
enhanced modes.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The MREADME.DOC file contains the following instructions:
<P>
Using the new Mouse software with Microsoft Windows:
<P>
<PRE>   To use your new Mouse driver software, including the "ballistic"
   characteristics, with Microsoft Windows, you must replace the
   MOUSE.DRV file on the backup copy of your Windows Setup disk with
   the MOUSE.DRV file located on the Utility or Setup disk in your
   Microsoft Mouse package, and then reinstall Windows. You may want
   to make a backup copy of your WIN.INI file, before doing the
   reinstallation. For more information on installing Microsoft
   Windows, see the "Microsoft Windows User's Guide."

</PRE>These instructions should be disregarded for the Microsoft Windows 3.0
and 3.1 setup.
<P>
The MOUSE.DRV file on the Microsoft Mouse driver disk has a file date of 3-
15-90 and a file size of 3699 bytes. The MOUSE.DRV file on the Windows 3.0
disk has a file date of 5-01-90, and a size of 2896 bytes. If the file size
of MOUSE.DRV on the Windows disk is anything other than 2896 bytes, an
incorrect MOUSE.DRV has been copied onto the disk or the disk is damaged.
<P>
The Microsoft Mouse driver disk may be sent as an update from Microsoft End
User Sales (call [800] 426-9400) and is packaged with Windows and with the
Microsoft Mouse. Acceleration or "ballistic" mouse characteristics are
already included with the Microsoft Mouse driver included with Windows.
