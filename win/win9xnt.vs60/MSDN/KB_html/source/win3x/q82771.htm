<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When a Setup error message contains an error code, it also includes some
text indicating what Setup was trying to do, for example, copying a file.
The text of the error message indicates whether the error is fatal or not.
In some nonfatal cases, Setup may be performing an operation (such as
copying a file) that is needed to run Microsoft Windows. Other times the
error may prevent some specific feature of Windows from operating properly.
<P>
In many cases, the error code is an MS-DOS extended error code. These error
codes are between 0 and 100. Setup-specific error codes have two different
formats, depending on whether the error occurs during the character (MS-
DOS) mode or the Windows graphical user interface (GUI) mode portion of
Setup. The character mode Setup-specific error numbers are in the format
"Snnn", where "nnn" is any three-digit number. The GUI mode error numbers
are codes greater than 200.

208
<PRE>   Out of disk space during file copy in VerInstallFile. Because of
   the disk space checks that Setup does, this problem should occur
   only if you have upgraded over an invalid Windows installation
   (that is, files have been deleted manually). Make sure there is
   enough disk space and then run Setup again. Also make sure that
   VER.DLL does not exist in the WINDOWS directory. It should only be
   in the WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory.

</PRE>209
<PRE>   File in use. This error occurs if some file that needs to be
   replaced by Setup is in use or opened by another some other
   software. Make sure Setup is the only application running or exit
   Windows and run Setup from the MS-DOS prompt.

</PRE>210
<PRE>   Destination file is write-protected. Type

      ATTRIB -r &lt;filename&gt;

   at the MS-DOS prompt, where &lt;filename&gt; is the indicated file and
   run Setup again. This problem may also be caused by virus-
   protection software, in which case, this software should be
   disabled while running Setup.

</PRE>211
<PRE>   Buffers allocated for file expansion operations are too small.
   This error should never occur. If it does, free up some memory and
   run Setup again.

</PRE>212
<PRE>   Unknown version mismatch happened during attempt to install file.
   This problem can be caused by the incorrect version of VER.DLL
   running or by corrupt files. Make sure you do not have VER.DLL in
   your WINDOWS directory. It should only be in the WINDOWS\SYSTEM
   directory.

</PRE>213
<PRE>   File expansion initialization failed. This problem is probably due
   to insufficient memory.

</PRE>214
<PRE>   Source file is unreadable. This problem is probably due to drive
   hardware problems, corrupt files or disks, or, if you are setting
   up from a network, network problems. Setup error 214 can also be
   caused by incorrect CMOS settings for floppy drives or third party
   extended memory managers.
