The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you run Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.0, the following
error message may occur while running multiple applications:
<P>
<PRE>   Could not continue running Windows because of paging error.

</PRE>This error message is usually caused by running Windows on 386 computers
with low RAM configurations. Increasing the amount of RAM or reducing the
number of applications running will usually lessen the chances of receiving
a paging error. In addition, running less MS-DOS-based applications with
the PIF's background option set will help reduce these errors because
Windows will be able to free more RAM by swapping the MS-DOS-based
application out to the swap file. Some Windows-based applications are more
prone to causing paging errors due to their memory-allocation methods.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In 386 enhanced mode, Windows uses both physical RAM and hard-drive space,
by using temporary or permanent swap files, to supply applications with the
memory that they need. This process is controlled by Windows Virtual Memory
Manager (VMM).
<P>
<P><h3>How VMM Works</h3>
 
<P>
When virtual memory is used in 386 enhanced mode, some program code and
data are kept in physical memory while the rest is swapped to the hard disk
in a swap file to free more physical RAM for other applications. Whenever a
reference is made to a memory address, it can be used without interruption
if the information is currently in physical RAM. If the information is not
in physical RAM, then a Page Fault occurs and the VMM takes control,
pulling the required information back into physical RAM and, if necessary,
swapping other information to the disk.
<P>
<P><h3>What Happens When a Paging Error Occurs</h3>
 
<P>
Windows is encountering a nested page fault. It causes the hard drive to
attempt to read and write information faster than the VMM can control. This
condition is known as "disk-racing" or "disk-thrashing" due to the high
rate of hard-disk access.
<P>
This race condition occurs when one or more 4K pages of memory are brought
into physical RAM from the swap file, and at the same time Windows must
force one or more 4K pages out of physical RAM and into the swap file. The
problem occurs when the pages that were moved to the swap file are needed
immediately and are brought back into physical RAM, forcing the previous
pages back to the swap file.
<P>
The situation quickly degenerates into a disk-racing or disk-thrashing
condition and the system shuts down, displaying the above error message.
You may notice the hard drive light is constantly on before the error
message is displayed.
<P>
Windows uses three types of code:

<OL><P><LI>Fixed or locked code that cannot be moved from one memory address
   to another

<P><LI>Moveable code that can be relocated from one memory address to
   another or even swapped out to disk

<P><LI>Discardable code that can be deleted from memory and is reread
   from the hard drive when needed
<P>
</OL>The condition to trigger this problem can be minimized by applications
designed to use mostly moveable or discardable code, which is not locked
into physical RAM address, but can be swapped out to disk or to another RAM
address. In protect mode, moveable code can still be moved in memory even
when the global memory is locked (GlobalLocked()).
<P>
In Windows 3.0, fixed memory is page locked at a specific memory address in
386 enhanced mode. This can create large chunks of code located in RAM
memory that can quickly overload Windows' paging system.
