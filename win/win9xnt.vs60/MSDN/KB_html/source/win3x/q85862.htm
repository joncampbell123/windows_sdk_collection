The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11
<LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11
<LI>Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
You may receive the following error message when you try to start Microsoft
Windows or run Microsoft Windows Setup:
<P>
<PRE>   Error Loading PROGMAN.EXE

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The following can cause of this error message:

<UL><LI>An incorrect or missing SHELL= line in the [boot] section of the
   SYSTEM.INI file

<LI>An incorrect version of the SHELL.DLL file

<LI>VSafe program

<LI>A CHKLIST.MS file in the Windows directory

<LI>The [boot] section heading is missing in your SYSTEM.INI file.

<LI>The PROGMAN.INI file is corrupt.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following sections cover the different causes of the above error
message.
<P>
<P><h3>Incorrect or Missing SHELL= Line</h3>
 
<P>
You receive the error message if the SHELL= line in the [boot] section of
your SYSTEM.INI file is missing or is set to a file that does not exist.
Under Windows version 3.0, you receive an unrecoverable application error
(UAE) if the SHELL= line is missing or set incorrectly.
<P>
The SHELL= line in the [boot] section of the SYSTEM.INI file should
read as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   SHELL=PROGMAN.EXE

</PRE>If this error continues, or if an undefined dynalink error occurs, check
the [boot] section in the SYSTEM.INI file for the line referring to
SYSTEM.DRV=. This line must be present and should read as follows (unless
it is modified by a third-party application, such as Adobe Type Manager):
<P>
<PRE>   SYSTEM.DRV=SYSTEM.DRV

</PRE><h3>Incorrect Version of SHELL.DLL</h3>
 
<P>
Earlier releases of the SHELL.DLL file may prevent Program Manager from
starting. Use the EXPAND utility (EXPAND.EXE) to expand the correct version
of SHELL.DLL to the Windows SYSTEM directory. The following is an example
of the command to be used with the EXPAND utility from Windows 3.1:
<P>
<PRE>   expand &lt;a&gt;:shell.dl_ &lt;c&gt;:\windows\system\shell.dll

</PRE>The drive letters (&lt;a&gt; and &lt;c&gt; in this example) vary depending on the
location of the source and destination of your files. SHELL.DL_ can be
found on Disk 5 (5.25-inch) or on Disk 4 (3.5-inch) of the Windows 3.1
operating system disks.
<P>
Earlier versions of PROGMAN.EXE do not work with the new SHELL.DLL file.
Use the EXPAND command to expand the correct version of PROGMAN.EXE to the
Windows directory. For example, if you are expanding PROGMAN.EX from a disk
in drive a to C:\WINDOWS, type the following command:
<P>
<PRE>   expand a:progman.ex_ c:\windows\progman.exe

</PRE>The drive letters (&lt;a&gt; and &lt;c&gt; in this example) vary depending on the
location of the source and destination of your files. PROGMAN.EX_ can be
found on Disk 4 (5.25-inch) or on Disk 4 (3.5-inch) of the Windows 3.1
operating system disks.
<P>
<P><h3>VSafe Virus-Scanning Software</h3>
 
<P>
The VSAFE.SYS and/or VSAFE.COM virus-protection programs can cause the
above error message. To correct this problem, remove VSAFE.SYS from the
CONFIG.SYS file, and remove VSAFE.COM from the LOAD= line in the WIN.INI
file and your Startup group.
<P>
<P><h3>CHKLIST.MS File in the Windows Directory</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft Anti-Virus creates CHKLIST.MS files and places them in almost
every directory that it checks. If a CHKLIST.MS file is placed in the
Windows directory, the error message above is generated. To correct this
problem, delete the CHKLIST.MS file from your Windows directory.
<P>
NOTE: The file may be reinserted in the directory the next time you use
Anti-Virus; you must delete the file again if the error message reappears.
<P>
<P><h3>The [boot] Section Heading is Missing in Your SYSTEM.INI File</h3>
 
<P>
To correct this problem use a text editor such as Microsoft MS-DOS Editor
to edit the SYSTEM.INI file and add the correct heading.
<P>
The PROGMAN.INI File is Corrupt
 
<P>
To correct this problem use a text editor such as Microsoft MS-DOS Editor
to edit the PROGMAN.INI file and correct entries.
