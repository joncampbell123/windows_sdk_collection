The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The information in this article was taken from the SYSINI.WRI file
contained in the Microsoft Windows Resource Kit for Windows version 3.1.
The SYSINI.WRI file may be viewed with Windows Write.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The [boot] section of the SYSTEM.INI file contains a list of drivers and
Windows modules that are used to configure Windows each time it boots. All
settings contained in this section are required, with the exception of the
CachedFileHandles entry.
<P>
If any of these settings are modified or deleted, Windows may not work
properly. There are no built-in default values for these settings; these
settings are assigned upon Setup based on the system configuration.
<P>
The [boot] section can contain the settings described in the following
paragraphs.
<P>
<P><h3>286grabber=&lt;filename&gt;</h3>
 
<P>
Default:  None
Purpose:  Specifies the filename of the device driver
<PRE>          (called a grabber) that makes a non-Windows
          application visible when you use Windows in
          standard mode.
</PRE>To change:  Choose the Windows Setup icon from the Main
<PRE>            Group window. This setting changes when you
            change the Display setting in Setup. If you are
            installing a device driver that is not included
            with Windows, run Setup from MS-DOS.

</PRE><h3>386grabber=&lt;filename&gt;</h3>
 
<P>
Default:  None
Purpose:  Specifies the filename of the device driver
<PRE>          (called a grabber) that makes a non-Windows
          application visible when you use Windows in 386
          enhanced mode.
</PRE>To change:  Choose the Windows Setup icon from the Main
<PRE>            Group window. This setting changes when you
            change the display setting in Setup. If you are
            installing a device driver that is not included
            with Windows, run Setup from MS-DOS.

</PRE><h3>CachedFileHandles=&lt;number&gt;</h3>
 
<P>
Default:  12
Purpose:  Specifies the number of the most recently-used
<PRE>          executable (.exe) and dynamic link library (.dll)
          files that can remain open. Windows keeps these
          files open so that they can be accessed quickly,
          ensuring optimal performance. However, some
          networks have a limit on the number of files that
          can be open on a server at a time. If you are
          having problems running Windows from a Network
          server, use a lower number for this setting. Valid
          numbers are 2 through 12.
</PRE>To change:  Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
<P>
<P><h3>comm.drv=&lt;filename&gt;</h3>
 
<P>
Default:  None
Purpose:  Specifies the filename of the serial
<PRE>          communications driver you are using.
</PRE>To change:  Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
<P>
<P><h3>display.drv=&lt;filename&gt;</h3>
 
<P>
Default:  None
Purpose:  Specifies the filename of the display driver you
<PRE>          are using.
</PRE>To change:  Choose the Windows Setup icon from the Main
<PRE>            Group window. If you are installing a device
            driver that is not included with Windows, run
            Setup from MS-DOS.

</PRE><h3>drivers=&lt;filename-or-aliasname&gt;</h3>
 
<P>
Default:  None
Purpose:  Specifies the filename(s) or alias name(s) of the
<PRE>          installable drivers that load when Windows is
          started. An installable driver is a dynamic-link
          library that is treated by Windows like a device
          driver. If the drivers you want to use include
          parameters, you must specify them by alias name.
          Alias names are defined in the [Drivers] section
          of the SYSTEM.INI file. You can list several file
          or alias names in this setting
</PRE>To change:  Most setup programs add these settings to the
<PRE>            SYSTEM.INI file when installing installable
            drivers, so you shouldn't need to change the
            settings. Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI
            file.

</PRE><h3>fixedfon.fon=&lt;filename&gt;</h3>
 
<P>
Default:  None
Purpose:  Specifies the filename of the fixed system font

          be used by version 2.x applications.
</PRE>To change:  Choose the Windows Setup icon from the Main-
<PRE>            group window. This setting changes when you
            change the display setting.

</PRE><h3>fonts.fon=&lt;filename&gt;</h3>
 
<P>
Default:  None
Purpose:  Specifies the filename of the proportionately-
<PRE>          spaced system font used by Windows 3.1.
</PRE>To change:  Choose the Windows Setup icon from the Main-
<PRE>            group window. This setting changes when you
            change the display setting in Setup.

            Keyboard option.

<P>
Default:  None
Purpose:  Specifies the name of the dynamic-link library
<PRE>          that supplies language-specific functions. If no
          language library is specified, Windows uses the
          built-in U.S. English library.
</PRE>To change:  Choose the International icon from the Control
<PRE>            Panel window and change the setting for the
            Language option.

</PRE><h3>mouse.drv=&lt;filename&gt;</h3>
 
<P>
Default:  None
Purpose:  Specifies the filename of the mouse driver you are
<PRE>          using.
</PRE>To change:  Choose the Windows Setup icon from the Main-
<PRE>            group window and change the setting for the
            Mouse option.

</PRE><h3>network.drv=&lt;filename&gt;</h3>
 
<P>
Default:  None
Purpose:  Specifies the filename of the network driver you
<PRE>          are using.

<PRE>            group window and change the setting for the

<P>
Default:  None (Setup initializes this value as PROGMAN.EXE)

<PRE>          driver you are using.
