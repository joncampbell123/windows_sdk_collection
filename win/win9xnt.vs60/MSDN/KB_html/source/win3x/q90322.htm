The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11
<LI>Microsoft Workgroup Connections version 1.0
</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If resource connections are persistent in Windows for Workgroups or
Workgroup Connections, connecting to and disconnecting from resource
connections in Windows for Workgroups and Workgroup Connections
changes the list of persistent connections.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Disconnecting from a network drive is permanent, and removes it from
the list of persistent connections. There is no one-time-only
disconnect feature, although you can replace a persistent connection
for one session with a temporary connection. This can only be done in
Windows for Workgroups through the Connect Network and Connect Network
Printer dialog boxes.
<P>
To use a resource for one session, without disrupting the persistent
connection list, clear the selection of the Reconnect At Startup check
box when connecting to that resource.
<P>
The CONNECT.DAT file contains a list of persistent connections. When
starting the network, either from Windows Connections or Windows for
Workgroups, this list is used to keep track of the connections. These
connections are established when you either log on to the network in
Windows Connections, or when Windows for Workgroups is started.
<P>
For example, if a persistent printer resource is set in Windows for
Workgroups and is then disconnected from Windows Connections by using
the NET command, the resource will not automatically reconnect when
starting Windows for Workgroups.
<P>
<P><h3>Novell Users</h3>
 
<P>
You must log on to Novell before starting Windows for Workgroups
for persistent connections to be established when starting Windows for
Workgroups.
