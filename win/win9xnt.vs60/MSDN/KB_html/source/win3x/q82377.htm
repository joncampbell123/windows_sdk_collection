<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Sometimes Borland's Turbo C++ may appear to stop (hang) when you install
Turbo C++ from Microsoft Windows File Manager; however, Turbo C++ is not
hung. Resize the open windows so that the Turbo C++ Setup application icon
is visible. Setup continues normally.
<P>
This also may apply to other Borland products using similar install
engines.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Some third-party products have a Setup program that looks for actions, in
this case an unnecessary WM_PAINT (to repaint the icon), that tell Setup to
continue. Under Windows, WM_PAINT is not sent if the application's icon
does not need to be repainted, as when it is covered by other windows.
<P>
Make sure the icon (created by double-clicking the Setup program in File
Manager) is exposed. Move the icon, or resize any obscuring windows, and
Setup continues as expected.
<P>
The products included here are manufactured by vendors independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these
products' performance or reliability.
