The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.1, 3.11
<LI>Microsoft Mouse Driver for Windows, versions 8.1, 8.2, 9.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
It is possible to change the size, color, and other attributes of the
mouse cursor in Microsoft Windows version 3.1.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The software included with the Microsoft Mouse driver, versions 8.1,
8.2, and 9.0 provides a Windows Mouse Control Panel that allows you to
customize the mouse in the following ways:
<P>
<PRE>   Cursor Size:  Small, Medium, or Large

   Cursor Color: White, Reverse, or Transparent

   Acceleration: Slow, Moderate, Fast, or Unaccelerated

   Sensitivity:  Adjusts how far the cursor moves per inch of mouse
                 movement

   Buttons:      Allows you to choose the primary and secondary buttons

   Double-Click: Allows you to adjust the double-click speed

   Grow:         Causes the mouse to enlarge when it is moved to improve
                 cursor visibility

   Mouse Trails: Shows a trail of mouse cursors when the mouse is moved
                 to improve cursor visibility

</PRE><h3>Installation of the Microsoft Mouse Software</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start Windows.

<P><LI>Insert the mouse Setup disk into drive A.

<P><LI>From File menu in Windows Program Manager, choose Run.

<P><LI>In the Command Line box, type "a:\setup" (without the quotation
   marks).

<P><LI>Follow the instructions on the screen to complete the installation.
   There are options to set up the mouse for Windows and for MS-DOS.
   The software is installed by default in the C:\MOUSE directory.
<P>
   Note: If you are installing version 8.2 of the Mouse driver,
   don't let the Setup program restart your computer; it will hang.
   (This problem does not occur in version 9.0 of the Setup program.)
<P>
</OL>The Mouse Setup program installs a mouse group, which includes the Mouse
Control Panel, into the Windows Program Manager (versions 3.0 and later).
The Setup program also adds POINTER.EXE to the Load= line in the WIN.INI
file.
<P>
In Windows 3.1, Setup also integrates the Mouse Control Panel into the
Windows Control Panel. Both Mouse Control Panels function exactly the same.
If you want, you can delete the mouse group from the Windows 3.1 Program
Manager. You can then use the Mouse icon located in the Windows Control
Panel to customize the mouse.
<P>
The Microsoft Mouse software is included with the Microsoft Mouse and
Microsoft BallPoint Mouse. Information about obtaining updated mouse
software is available at the Microsoft Sales Information Center (MSIC) by
calling (800) 426-9400.
