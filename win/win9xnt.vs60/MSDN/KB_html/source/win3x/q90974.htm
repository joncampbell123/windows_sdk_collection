1. Q. What are the general requirements for using Microsoft Mail
      and Microsoft Schedule+ with Microsoft Windows for Workgroups?

   A. To effectively use Mail and Schedule+, all computers within a
      workgroup should be connected to one postoffice. Only one
      postoffice should be created for a workgroup. Schedule+ relies
      on the established Mail connections in order to work correctly.
      For more information, please refer to the user's guides for Mail
      and Schedule+.

2. Q. What steps are involved in creating a new postoffice for
      Microsoft Mail?

   A. To use Mail, create only one postoffice for all computers in a
      designated workgroup. If you will be the postoffice
      administrator, use the following four steps to do this:

      1. When you start Mail for the first time, select the Create
         A New Workgroup Postoffice option. Unless you specify
         otherwise, this creates a new subdirectory named WGPO in the
         postoffice administrator's Windows directory by default.

      2. Enter your administrator account details in the dialog
         box. You must include entries for Name and Mailbox. A
         password is optional. The Name value is your alias for Mail.
         The Mailbox value is used for internal referencing in Mail.
         The Password value defaults to the word "password"; however,
         you can change this value or remove it if you choose not to
         have a password.

      3. In File Manager, select the WGPO directory.

      4. From the Disk menu, choose Share As, and select the Full
         option button under Access Type. You may want to type
         "Postoffice" (without the quotation marks) in the Comment
         field so that people at other workstations can identify this
         directory when they connect to the postoffice.

3. Q. I cannot access the initial mail dialog box that allows you
      to either connect to or create a postoffice. How can I correct
      this problem?

   A. This problem occurs when more than one postoffice exists within
      a workgroup. Extra postoffices must be deleted. If you delete
      the extra postoffices, those computers that were formerly
      postoffices must connect to the existing postoffice. To delete
      extra postoffices, use the following four steps:

      1. Quit Mail.

      2. From File Manager, select the MSMAIL.INI file. From the
         File menu, choose Rename. In the To box, type "msmail.bak"
         (without the quotation marks), then choose the OK button.

      3. Restart Mail. In the Welcome To Mail dialog box, select
         the Connect To An Existing Postoffice option.

      4. Select the server name and shared directory for the
         postoffice. If you do not have an account, add your
         information to the postoffice.

       NOTE: You must have entries for the Name, Mailbox, and Password
       boxes. Be sure to use the same entries that you were using
       before you renamed the MSMAIL.INI file so that you can access
       your old mail messages.

4. Q. I'm receiving the error messages "Cannot establish a DOS or
      Windows Mail Server" and "Cannot connect to the Workgroup
      Postoffice." How can I correct this problem?

   A. If you receive the error message "Cannot establish a DOS or
      Windows Mail Server" or "Cannot connect to the Workgroup
      Postoffice," a postoffice may not have been created yet or your
      postoffice server may be down. Check with the workgroup or
      system administrator to find out if a postoffice has been
      created. If a postoffice has not been created, determine who
      will be the postoffice administrator and refer to the previous
      procedure for creating a postoffice.

      If a postoffice has been created, you may need to modify the
      MSMAIL.INI file to reflect the location of the postoffice. Use
      the following three steps:

      1. Quit Mail.

      2. Open the MSMAIL.INI file from the Windows directory in an
         ASCII text editor, such as Microsoft Windows Notepad.

      3. Note the entry beside the ServerPath= setting. This should
         match the server name and the shared directory name of the
         postoffice. The proper syntax is as follows:

           serverpath=\\servername\directoryname

5. Q. I can't move mail messages or delete them from a folder. How
      can I correct this problem?

   A. If you cannot move or delete mail messages from a folder, you
      may have a corrupt MSMAIL.MMF file. This file contains all your
      mail folders and messages. To repair the MSMAIL.MMF file, use
      the following three steps:

      1. From the File menu in Microsoft Mail, choose Exit And Sign
         Out.

      2. Restart Mail.

      3. If the built-in Mail utility detects any corrupt mail
         files, a dialog box should appear with the message "Your
         database file is corrupt, repair now?" Choose the Yes button.

      The Mail Message File utility should repair any damage to the
      MSMAIL.MMF file and, when completed, return to Mail.

6. Q. I am receiving the error message "Schedule file could not be
      opened. You may not have the necessary access privileges or the
      file may not be available." How can I correct this problem?

   A. When you choose Open Other's Appt. Book from the File menu in
      Schedule+, you may receive the error message "Schedule file
      could not be opened. You may not have the necessary access
      privileges or the file may not be available." This error occurs
      when the person whose file you are trying to access has not
      granted you access privileges. You must have at least the Read
      Appointments And Tasks privilege to open another's Appointment
      Book. The default setting for privileges is View Free/Busy
      Times, which allows you to view other schedules from Planner.

      Schedule+ defaults to the Appointment Book. To access Planner,
      you must select the tab labeled Planner from the left side of
      the Schedule+ screen. To set access privileges for other users,
      choose Set Access Privileges from the Options menu. For more
      information on access privileges, please refer to the "User's
      Guide."

7. Q. How can I import appointments from Microsoft Windows
      Calendar or WordPerfect Office into Microsoft Schedule+?

   A. Schedule+ has a feature that allows you to import appointments
      from Windows Calendar 3.1 and WordPerfect Office. To import your
      appointments from either of these applications, use the
      following three steps:

      1. In Schedule+, choose Import Appointments from the File
         menu.

      2. In the List Files Of Type box, select the file type that
         corresponds to the appointment book application.

      3. Select a file to import, then choose the OK button.

8. Q. I changed my password in Microsoft Mail and the new password
      works correctly in Mail; however, Schedule+ is prompting me for
      my old password. Is this a problem?

   A. No. If you change your password in Mail, the Schedule+ password
      is affected. After you successfully create a new password in
      Mail, you are prompted for your old password in Schedule+ before
      you can enter the application. If you change your password in
      Schedule+, Mail accepts your new password without prompting you
      for your old password.
