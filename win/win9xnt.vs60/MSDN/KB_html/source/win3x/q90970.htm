 1. Q. What are the memory and disk space system requirements for
       Microsoft Windows for Workgroups?

    A. Windows for Workgroups must be run in 386 enhanced mode in
       order to share resources. 386 enhanced mode requires a minimum
       of 3 megabytes (MB) of memory; however, 4 MB is recommended.
       Standard mode operation requires a minimum of 2 MB of memory.
       These memory requirements refer to total conventional and
       extended memory only. Windows for Workgroups requires a minimum
       of 9.5 MB and a maximum of 14.5 MB of free disk space.
       Upgrading over Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1
       reduces these free disk space requirements to a minimum of 3.5
       MB and a maximum of 8.5 MB. Workgroup Connections require 320
       kilobytes (K) of free conventional memory and 1 MB of free disk
       space.

       Windows for Workgroups must be installed on a workstation that
       has a hard disk drive. Windows for Workgroups and Workgroup
       Connections are supported on MS-DOS-based systems.

 2. Q. I'm having difficulty installing Microsoft Windows for
       Workgroups. What should I do?

    A. Complete information on installing Windows for Workgroups is
       contained in the "Getting Started" manual. The following are
       five general setup tips:

       1. Before you run the Setup program, start your machine with a
          minimal configuration. For more information, please refer to
          the section titled "Streamline the CONFIG.SYS and
          AUTOEXEC.BAT Files" in Chapter 6 of the "Getting Started"
          manual. The examples provided in this manual refer to a
          minimum configuration after Windows for Workgroups is
          loaded. The last three lines in the CONFIG.SYS file and the
          first line in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file that relate to the
          network are not loaded before installation.

       2. Windows for Workgroups installations are most successful
          when installed to a newly created and empty subdirectory.
          This applies to all packages of Windows for Workgroups,
          including upgrade packages. Upgrading over a Windows 3.x
          environment configured for a network other than Microsoft
          LAN Manager or Novell(R) NetWare(R) may cause
          incompatibility issues. If Windows 3.x is currently
          installed on your computer for a network, choose the Windows
          Setup icon, choose Change Systems Settings from the Options
          menu, and select the No Network Installed option before you
          run the Windows for Workgroups upgrade.

       3. If your Windows 3.x environment is not installed for a
          network and you are using any third-party drivers, font
          software, desktop shells, or utilities, consider installing
          Windows for Workgroups to a different directory. If you
          choose to upgrade over the Windows 3.x directories, at least
          disable any third-party products from the Windows 3.x
          environment before you run Setup.

       4. Workgroup Connections should be installed to a different
          subdirectory; do not upgrade over Windows. If you do so, a
          new SYSTEM.INI file is created.

       5. During Setup, if your machine locks up, reboots itself, or
          displays corrupt images on the screen, Setup may have
          incorrectly recognized your hardware. For solutions to these
          problems, please refer to the section titled "Setting Up
          Windows for Workgroups" in Chapter 6 of the "Getting
          Started" manual.

 3. Q. Where can I find more information about setup entries and
       the setup of supported network adapter cards?

    A. To properly configure your network card, please refer to the
       complete instructions in the section titled "Setting Up a
       Network Card" in Chapter 6 of the "Getting Started" manual. The
       following are four general tips:

       1. Entries referring to Workgroup and ComputerName should be
          limited to 15 characters. All other share names should
          conform to the MS-DOS file-naming convention, which consists
          of an eight-character maximum filename and an optional
          extension limited to three characters.

       2. The Windows for Workgroups Setup may not always detect your
          network card and its configuration accurately. For this
          reason, you may want to choose Custom Setup so that you can
          modify the network card configuration. This configuration
          can also be changed in the Windows for Workgroups Control
          Panel after Setup is complete.

       3. Some cards, such as the Intel(R) EtherExpress(TM), may be
          software configurable; therefore, there may not be any
          jumpers and/or switches on the card to configure the IRQ,
          I/O port, and RAM addresses. The Windows for Workgroups
          network card installation software configures these cards.

       4. Windows for Workgroups supports only the NetBEUI protocol.
          The MSIPX protocol is available only after you install the
          optional network functionality for Novell NetWare. The
          protocols conform to the Network Driver Interface
          Specification (NDIS). If you want to use another protocol,
          obtain the NDIS-compliant protocol driver and an
          OEMSETUP.INF file from the software company that provides
          the protocol.

 4. Q. Where can I find information on installing unlisted
       network protocols and adapters?

    A. Information on installing third-party networks and protocols
       can be found on pages 152 and 204 of the "User's Guide." The
       following are six general tips:

       1. For information about using the Microsoft LAN Manager TCP/IP
          protocol with Microsoft Windows for Workgroups, please refer
          to the Windows for Workgroups Resource Kit. For information on
          purchasing Microsoft Data Link Control (DLC) and Microsoft
          TCP/IP for Windows for Workgroups, Call Microsoft Consumer
          Sales at (800) 426-9400. Both TCP/IP and MSDLC are supported
          by Microsoft LAN Manager support.

       2. The MSIPX protocol is available only after you add Novell
          NetWare connectivity to Windows for Workgroups.

       3. If you have an Ethernet adapter that can emulate either an
          NE1000 or an NE2000 network card, choose the NE1000-
          compatible adapter for an 8-bit card or the NE2000-
          compatible adapter for a 16-bit card in the Network Adapter
          dialog box.

       4. If you have an ArcNet(R) adapter that conforms to the
          Network Driver Interface Specification (NDIS), select ArcNet
          Compatible in the Network Adapter dialog box.

       5. If you are not sure whether your network card can use the
          drivers included with Windows for Workgroups, please refer
          to the Network Adapter Compatibility List available through
          the FastTips Technical Note Library.

       6. If your network card is not listed in the Network Adapter
          Compatibility List, you must obtain the NDIS driver specific
          to your network card and the OEMSETUP.INF file from the
          vendor of your network card. The OEMSETUP.INF file is
          necessary for the proper installation of the network card.
          Information on how to create an OEMSETUP.INF file is
          available through the FastTips Technical Note Library.

 5. Q. I'm receiving the error message, "The Protocol Manager has
       reported an incomplete binding." What is causing this error?

    A. The error "The Protocol Manager has reported an incomplete
       binding" is most often caused by a conflict in the upper memory
       area or an incorrect setting in the PROTOCOL.INI file. To
       correct the error, use the following two steps:

       1. If the memory manager EMM386.EXE is loaded in the CONFIG.SYS
          file, modify the line to read as follows:

            device=&lt;path&gt;emm386.exex=a000-efff

       2. Save this file and restart the computer. If the "incomplete
          binding" error message continues after you modify the
          CONFIG.SYS file, the answers to the next two questions may
          help you correct this problem.

 6. Q. I'm still receiving the "incomplete binding" error message
       after I exclude the upper memory area with EMM386 in the
       CONFIG.SYS file. What should I try next?

    A. If you still receive the "incomplete binding" error message
       after you have excluded the upper memory area, use the
       following four steps to check for possible PROTOCOL.INI setting
       errors:

       1. In the Control Panel window, choose the Network icon.

       2. Choose the Adapters button and note the brand name and model
          of the network card listed under Network Adapter In Use. If
          the network adapter is incorrect, choose the Remove button,
          then choose the Add button to select the correct driver.

       3. Note the IRQ, I/O Port, and Base Memory address
          configurations. If any of these settings is incorrect,
          change the entry to its correct setting. This configuration
          information can also be found by choosing the Setup button
          in the Network Adapter dialog box.

       4. The last item to check is the protocol. You must have at
          least one protocol selected in the dialog box titled
          Protocols In Use. Windows for Workgroups supports the
          NetBEUI protocol. MSIPX is only available after Novell
          NetWare connectivity is added to Windows for Workgroups.

 7. Q. I'm still receiving the "incomplete binding" error message
       even after I have confirmed and corrected all the settings in
       the PROTOCOL.INI file. What should I do now?

    A. If you continue to receive the "incomplete binding" error
       message after you verify that all the settings in the
       PROTOCOL.INI file are correct, and if you are using the Intel
       EtherExpress adapter card, use the following three steps:

       1. Turn off the computer and disconnect any cables from the
          card.

       2. Attach a T connector to the card with two terminators on the
          T.

       3. Restart the computer. If the message "The Protocol Manager
          has reported an incomplete binding" no longer displays,
          there is a problem with the cable.

 8. Q. I'm running Microsoft Windows for Workgroups on a Novell
       Token Ring network and am receiving the error message "File
       server cannot be found." What is causing this error?

    A. If you are running on a Novell Token Ring network, the error
       "File server cannot be found" may be caused by loading
       ROUTE.COM in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file. Edit the AUTOEXEC.BAT file
       and remove the line that loads ROUTE.COM. After you save the
       file, restart your machine.

 9. Q. I'm running on a Novell Ethernet network and am receiving
       the error message "File server cannot be found." What is
       causing this error?

    A. If you are running on a Novell Ethernet network, the error
       message "File server cannot be found" may be caused by
       exceeding the user limit of the Novell software or by an entry
       in the PROTOCOL.INI file referring to the incorrect Ethernet
       frame type. If you have not exceeded your user limit on the
       Novell network, try correcting this problem by using the
       following three steps:

       1. In the Control Panel window, choose the Network icon, then
          choose the Adapters button.

       2. Select the adapter that is bound to MSIPX, choose the Setup
          button, then choose the Advanced button.

       3. Select Novell IPX from the Protocols In Use box, then choose
          the Settings button.

       4. In the Adapter Media Type Value box, you will see either
          Novell/Ethernet or Ethernet_II(DIX). Note which parameter is
          indicated, and then select the other Media Type parameter.

10. Q. I'm receiving the error message "NetBIOS session limit
       exceeded." What is causing this error?

    A. "NetBIOS session limit exceeded" refers to the number of
       connections that can be made to your server at any one time.
       This limit is affected by the number of sessions set in the
       [MS$NetBEUI] section of the PROTOCOL.INI file. Other protocols
       refer to variables other than SESSIONS. Please refer to your
       network protocol documentation for more information. Use the
       following four steps to increase the number of sessions:

       1. Open the PROTOCOL.INI file from the WINDOWS directory in an
          ASCII text editor, such as Microsoft Windows Notepad.

       2. Locate the section titled [MS$NetBEUI].

       3. Double the value following SESSIONS=. When you increase the
          value following SESSIONS=, you must also increase the value
          following NCBS=. The NCBS value should be double the value
          of SESSIONS.

       4. Save the file and restart Windows.
