The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL>

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you upgrade from Windows 3.0 to Windows 3.1, Setup attempts to update
the installed printer driver using the file PRTUPD.INF. If Setup cannot
find the file or if the installed printer is referenced differently in
Windows 3.0 than in Windows 3.1, the following error message may be
displayed:
<P>
<PRE>   Cannot find the PRTUPD.INF file necessary to upgrade Windows 3.0
   printer drivers. Be sure that the file is in a directory on the
   default path.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
If Windows 3.1 Setup determines that printer drivers from a previous
version of Windows are installed, it attempts to update these drivers using
the PRTUPD.INF file. If the printer is referenced differently in Windows
3.1 than in 3.0, the Setup program cannot find the information needed to
update the driver and may generate the above error message. For example,
for portrait mode on the Canon LBP-8 III, the WIN.INI file has the setting
"Orient=0" in the [LBPIIIDRV] section. The PRTUPD.INF file does not contain
the correct entry for this printer in portrait orientation. Setup does not
recognize the value in the WIN.INI file and therefore cannot update the
driver.
<P>
NOTE: The aforementioned error does not prevent successful installation of
Windows 3.1; Setup can still continue.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem after you have successfully installed
Windows 3.1, use the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>In the Control Panel window, choose the Printers icon.

<P><LI>Select your printer and choose the Remove button.

<P><LI>In File Manager, delete the appropriate printer driver,
   &lt;FILENAME&gt;.DRV, from the WINDOWS\SYSTEM subdirectory.

<P><LI>In the Control Panel window, choose the Printers icon.

<P><LI>Choose the Add button.

<P><LI>Choose the appropriate printer from the list of printers.

<P><LI>Choose the Install button, and follow the directions to install the
   new printer driver from the Windows disks.
<P>
</OL>The Hewlett-Packard DeskJet 500 and the Canon LBP Series IV printers
are also affected by this problem.
