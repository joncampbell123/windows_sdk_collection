<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When using Microsoft Windows SETUP /H with a SETUP.SHH file (or *.SHH
file), a file called WINMATIC.SHH is created in the user's directory. This
file is a copy of the SETUP.SHH file that was used during the installation.
<P>
To confirm what options were used to set up Windows, you can examine the
entries in this file. This file is not necessary for Windows to run, so it
can be deleted.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Windows Automated Setup option (also called Batch Mode Setup), allows
you to write a script file for Setup (an example called SETUP.SHH comes
with Windows 3.1), which automates the Setup and requires little user
input. You can configure Setup to automatically install certain printers,
applications, hardware options, and other options. The following is an
example of the command line:
<P>
<PRE>   SETUP /H X:\NETWIN\SETUP.SHH /N

</PRE>Note: SETUP.SHH is an example; you can use any acceptable filename with an
extension of .SHH.
<P>
For more information on this feature, refer to pages 75-82 of the
"Microsoft Windows Resource Kit" guide for operating system version 3.1.
