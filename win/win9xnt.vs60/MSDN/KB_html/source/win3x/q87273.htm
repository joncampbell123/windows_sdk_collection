The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11
<LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you try to create a directory or copy files in the Microsoft Windows
3.1 File Manager, you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Access Denied.
   Make sure the disk is not full or write-protected.

</PRE>If you are using Windows 3.0, the following message appears:
<P>
<PRE>   Cannot create directory.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
These error messages can occur when any of the following conditions exist:

<UL><LI>There is a file in the current directory with the same name as the
   directory that you are attempting to create. You can verify this with
   the File Manager Search command.

<LI>You try to copy files and the destination path exceeds 63 characters.

<LI>You try to rename a file that is being used by an application that uses
   SHARE.EXE or VSHARE.386.

<LI>You have 512 files in the root directory of the hard disk.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around these errors, rename the file or directory that you are
attempting to create, or copy the files to another location. You may also
be able to work around these errors if you remove unnecessary files from
the root directory.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
You may encounter this error message if you try to create a directory whose
path exceeds 63 characters. Windows follows the MS-DOS convention that
limits the length of a subdirectory path to 63 characters.
<P>
The maximum length of any subdirectory path cannot exceed 63 bytes,
measured from the beginning of the first name to the end of the last name
(excluding slashes in front or at the end of the PATH statement). MS-DOS
function call 47H (Get Current Directory) requires a 64-byte buffer in
memory to return the current directory path. The returned path is not
preceded by a backslash, but it is terminated by a 0. Therefore, MS-DOS
allows 32 nested levels if each subdirectory name is one letter long. If
path exceeds 63 characters, an error message is displayed.
