<P>
This article describes the WIN.INI file settings used by Access Pack
for Windows, version 3.0a. These entries are only added to your
WIN.INI file when you explicitly save setting changes using the Access
Utility provided with Access Pack.
<P>
WARNING: Be very careful when you modify WIN.INI file settings; refer
to the Access Pack WININI.WRI file for more information.
<P>
To change these settings, choose your settings using the Access
Utility, and then save them using the Save Parameter Changes to Disk
command from the File menu.
<P>
If you cannot run the Access Utility because of unsupported hardware,
you can add these entries to your WIN.INI file using a text editor,
such as Microsoft Windows Notepad. See the Access Pack WININI.WRI file
for more information about the structure of the WIN.INI file and
instructions on making changes.

</PRE>OnOffFeedback=&lt;0 or 1&gt;
<P>
Default: 1
Purpose: Specifies whether the system should produce a rising or
<PRE>         falling audible tone to indicate when the Keyboard Response
         features are turned on or off when using the keyboard. If this
         setting is 0, no sound is emitted.
