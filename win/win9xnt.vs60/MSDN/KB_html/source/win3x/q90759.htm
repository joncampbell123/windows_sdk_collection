1. Q. What is Microsoft WinLogin, and what does it do?

   A. Microsoft WinLogin is a set of tools designed to help manage the
      configurations of Microsoft Windows 3.1 workstations on a
      network.

      Using WinLogin, you can manage configuration files for the
      Windows operating system and for Windows-based applications from
      a central location on a network. This makes it easy to set up
      new applications or change characteristics for groups of users
      or types of workstations. With WinLogin, you need to change only
      one configuration file for each type of computer.

      You can also use WinLogin to match user preferences with
      workstation requirements. A user can log on to any workstation
      running WinLogin and see his or her own personalized Windows
      environment.

2. Q. How can I obtain Microsoft WinLogin?

   A. You can order Microsoft WinLogin from Microsoft Consumer Sales
      by calling (800) 426-9400 or by mailing a form supplied with the
      Windows Resource Kit (WRK) for the Microsoft Windows operating
      system version 3.1.

3. Q. What should I do if Microsoft WinLogin stops functioning
      after I change my Windows display driver?

   A. There are two ways for the WinLogin administrator to re-enable
      WinLogin after someone changes a display driver. The
      administrator can use the WinLogin client setup disk to
      automatically reinstall WinLogin on the client machine. Or, the
      administrator can manually make the changes described in the
      first paragraph of the "Changes to your Windows setup" section
      in the administrator's CLIENT.WRI file.

4. Q. When I try to run WinLogin, I receive the error messages
      "CANNOT CONNECT TO REMOTE RESOURCE" and "COULD NOT LOCATE THE
      FILE SYSTEM.MBD." Why is this occurring?

   A. The error messages "CANNOT CONNECT TO REMOTE RESOURCE" and
      "COULD NOT LOCATE THE FILE SYSTEM.MBD" indicate that the
      WinLogin workstation is not properly connected to the network
      drive where the WinLogin database resides. Reconnect to the
      network drive to restore the connection. The error messages
      should no longer be displayed.

5. Q. During the WinLogin Client Setup, I receive the error
      message "WinLogin Client Setup could not access the WinLogin
      Database as described in the WINLOGIN.INI." How can I correct
      this problem?

   A. The following two problems can cause the error message "WinLogin
      Client Setup could not access the WinLogin Database as described
      in the WINLOGIN.INI:"

      a. There may be insufficient space on the WinLogin client
         hard disk to initialize Setup.(A minimum of 500K of free disk
         space is required to set up a WinLogin client.)

      b. The client may not have access to the remote network
         resource. Make sure the client has full read-write access to
         the database and the network share is not password protected.

6. Q. What networks work with Microsoft WinLogin?

   A. Networks that work with Microsoft Windows version 3.1, except
      IBM PC-LAN Program (an MS-DOS-based network that does not
      support file locking), also work with WinLogin. If you are using
      Microsoft LAN Manager version 2.1, you must obtain an updated
      LANMAN21.DRV file. This file is available from the Microsoft
      Download Service (MSDL), Microsoft Consumer Sales, and Microsoft
      Product Support Services. If you are using 3Com(R) 3+Share(R) and you
      receive errors when you try to open the WinLogin database, you
      may need to increase the number of concurrent file range locks
      supported by your server.

7. Q. At the end of a WinLogin installation, I receive the error
      message "SHARING VIOLATION ON DRIVE" followed by a drive letter
      designation. How can I correct this problem?

   A. The following two situations can cause the "SHARING VIOLATION ON
      DRIVE" error message:

      a. Microsoft Windows and Microsoft WinLogin are using a file
         called VER.DLL. To determine if VER.DLL is being used, look
         for this file in the MS-DOS.T directory. If you find VER.DLL,
         choose the OK button to close the error message, then close
         and restart Windows.

      b. There is a failed installation of WinLogin. Check for the
         existence of a directory called \MS-SETUP.T. This directory
         may have been left in the root directory of the local hard
         drive. If this directory exists and contains the file
         VER.DLL, any subsequent attempts to run Setup generate this
         error message. To correct this problem, delete both the file
         and the directory and run Setup again.

8. Q. The network that I am using requires that SHARE.EXE be
      loaded. What values should I set for file space and for the
      number of file locks in my AUTOEXEC.BAT file?

   A. For networks that use SHARE.EXE, we recommend that the file
      space be set to 4096 and the number of file locks be set to 200.

9. Q. During WinLogin Setup, I have to select either Log Unknown
      Settings or Ignore. What are these options for? Can I change my
      selection at a later time?

   A. This option tells WinLogin how you want it to handle
      initialization settings that users cannot change. If you select
      the Log Unknown Settings option button, WinLogin creates a .DIF
      file for any initialization setting that cannot be changed. When
      you exit Windows, an error message informs you that the .DIF
      file has been created. The system administrator can use the
      information in this file to create merge rules. If you select
      the Ignore option button, WinLogin ignores the initialization
      setting and does not generate an error message. During WinLogin
      Setup, you select one of these options, and the database is set
      up accordingly. If you want to change this setting, you must
      reinstall WinLogin and create a new database file.
