<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Applications that support messaging application program interface (MAPI)
may not display the Mail, Send, or Send Mail menu command unless Workgroup
Mail has been run and a post office has been created and/or connected to.
<P>
As a result, you can fax documents using Microsoft At Work PC Fax only by
choosing Print from the File menu and then selecting the "Microsoft At Work
PC Fax on FAX" printer driver.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Windows for Workgroups Mail and At Work PC Fax support MAPI, which allows
compliant applications to provide a direct interface to the messaging
(mail) system through their own menu bars, such as the Send Mail command on
the Windows for Workgroups File Manager Mail menu, or the Send command on
the Microsoft Word for Windows File menu.
<P>
Applications check for MAPI support by issuing the Windows GetProfileInt
function at installation or at startup. This function searches for the
presence of a MAPI= variable in the [Mail] section of the WIN.INI file. If
this variable is present and is equal to one (1), MAPI support is present.
<P>
Windows for Workgroups Workgroup Mail creates these entries in the WIN.INI
file at run time, not at installation. Consequently, an application's check
for MAPI support fails unless Workgroup Mail has been run, and a post
office has been created or an existing post office has been connected to.
<P>
If you installed Windows for Workgroups 3.11 and selected "No Windows
support for networks" in the Networks dialog box, Mail cannot add the MAPI
entries to your WIN.INI file. To work around this problem, manually edit
your WIN.INI file to add the MAPI entries.
<P>
To manually add MAPI support:

<OL><P><LI>Ensure MAPI.DLL is in the Windows SYSTEM subdirectory. If it is not,
   expand MAPI.DL_ from the original Windows for Workgroups disks using the
   EXPAND command. For example, if your Windows directory is C:\WINDOWS and
   your Windows for Workgroups floppy disk is in drive A, type "expand
   a:\mapi.dl_ c:\windows\system\mapi.dll" (without the quotation marks) at
   an MS-DOS command prompt and then press ENTER.

<P><LI>Add the following lines to the WIN.INI file to enable MAPI support:
<P>
<P><PRE>      [Mail]
      MAPI=1
</PRE>
<P><LI>Quit and restart Windows for Workgroups.
<P></OL>
