</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article discusses the 1 Digitized Voice Channel feature of the
Sound Blaster card hardware and how it works with Windows with
Multimedia Extensions or Windows version 3.1.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The 1 Digitized Voice Channel is referred to as sampled sound,
digitized sound, and so forth. The Sound Blaster refers to it as a
digitized voice, which is NOT the same as the voices mentioned above.
Multimedia Extensions to Windows calls this digitized sound output
"waveform output," which is confusing because all sound is comprised
of waves. Digital enthusiasts call this pulse code modulation (PCM),
which is actually a more accurate title.
<P>
Digitized sound is real sound (human voice, music, effects, and so
forth) that is sampled and digitized with a digital-to-analog
converter (DAC). This is the same type of data stored on audio compact
discs (CDs); however, CDs have a much greater resolution both in
sample rate (44.1 kHz) and sample word size (12 to 16 bits).
<P>
PCM is a simple technique of encoding analog audio in a digital
format, where the waveform amplitude is sampled periodically (at the
sampling frequency) and stored as a number. The term "8 bit" means
that the stored number can have one of 256 discrete values; 12 bit has
4096 discrete values; and 16 bit has 65535.
<P>
The Sound Blaster has one mono 8-bit DAC that can be set to a sample
rate between ~4 kHz and ~23 kHz. This does not produce very high
quality but it can be fun none the less.
<P>
Incidentally, this is where that 24th voice of the Sound Blaster
version 1.0 card came from: 12 C/MS (creative music synthesizer) + 11
FM (frequency modulation) + 1 DAC = 24. This is misleading.
<P>
Multimedia Extensions to Windows requires a minimum of 11 kHz and 22
kHz 8-bit wave output, which the Sound Blaster can do.
<P>
The Sound Blaster supports three different adaptive
differential pulse code modulation (ADPCM) decompression ratios
(as well as no compression) in hardware. Below is a list of these
ratios:

<UL><LI>2 to 1 data compression:  4 bit ADPCM
<LI>3 to 1 data compression:  2.6 bit ADPCM
<LI>4 to 1 data compression:  2 bit ADPCM
<P>
</UL>The greater the ratio, the greater the degradation in sample quality.
<P>
Multimedia Extensions to Windows does not make use of ADPCM at this
time.
<P>
Sound Blaster is manufactured by Creative Labs, a vendor independent
of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding
this product's performance or reliability.
