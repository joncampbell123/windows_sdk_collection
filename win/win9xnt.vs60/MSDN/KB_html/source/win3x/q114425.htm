The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
This article discusses using Microsoft Windows for Workgroups with a floppy
disk configuration. Although the information outlined in this article does
allow Windows for Workgroups to access the network from a floppy disk,
Microsoft does not support this procedure. If the steps or procedures
described in this article do not function properly, a standard Windows for
Workgroups configuration should be used to access the network.
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The steps below describe how to create a bootable floppy disk that loads
the real-mode network, which allows you to connect to a Windows for
Workgroups 3.11 server. Once connected to the server, a full or a network
setup (SETUP /N) can be run to a local hard disk drive or to a directory on
a server machine. This setup disk is ideal for running a large number of
installations to local hard disk drives without needing the Windows for
Workgroups 3.11 disks for each installation.
<P>
This article assumes the following things:

<UL><LI>The network hardware is already installed.

<LI>All machines are using the same network adapter card with the same
   hardware settings. (If different network cards are being used, follow
   the instructions in the note in step 3.)

<LI>The workstation has at least 4 megabytes (MB) of RAM if run from a
   diskless workstation or 3 MB of RAM if run from a machine with a hard
   disk drive.

<LI>SETUP /A will be installed to a C:\WINSHARE directory.

<LI>SETUP /N will be installed to a C:\directory.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create a bootable floppy disk.
<P>
    NOTE: If you are using MS-DOS 6.x and you are not using DoubleSpace,
    you can delete the DBLSPACE.BIN file from the floppy disk to create
    more disk space.

<P><LI>Run an administrative installation (SETUP /A) of Windows for Workgroups
    3.11 to a C:\WINSHARE directory. This machine will be referred to as
    the server machine.

<P><LI>From the C:\WINSHARE directory, run a shared network installation
    (SETUP /N) to the server's hard disk drive (for example C:\KBNETWORK).
    Use the Custom Setup option to perform the following steps:
<P>
    a. Clear the Set Up Printers and "Set Up Applications Already on
       Hard Disk(s)" check boxes.
<P>
    b. Select None for the Swapfile setting.
<P>
    NOTE: To create a second floppy disk for a different type of network
    adapter card, simply repeat step 3 but choose a different directory
    name when you run SETUP /N. Ensure that the appropriate network adapter
    card and its settings are detected during Setup.

<P><LI>Delete the following files from the C:\directory to free
    additional disk space for the floppy disk:
<P>
       *.CLN
       *.WIN
       BOOTLOG.TXT
       EMM386.EXE
       MOUSE.INI
       MSCDEX.EXE
       NCDINFO.INI
       SPART.PAR

<P><LI>Copy the contents of the C:\directory to the root of the
    floppy disk you formatted in step 1.

<P><LI>Create an AUTOEXEC.BAT file and a CONFIG.SYS file on the floppy
    disk with at least the following entries:
<P>
       CONFIG.SYS
       ==========
<P>
       Files=30
       Buffers=20
       Lastdrive=z
       Device=A:\HIMEM.SYS
       Device=A:\IFSHLP.SYS
       Device=A:\RAMDRIVE.SYS 1024 512 512 /E
       &lt;Third-party disk partitioner&gt;
       &lt;Third-party disk-compression driver&gt;
       &lt;Other necessary third-party driver&gt;
<P>
       NOTE: If the workstation has a hard disk drive, the
       Device=A:\RAMDRIVE.SYS is not necessary and can be removed from the
       CONFIG.SYS file.
<P>
       AUTOEXEC.BAT
       ============
<P>
       A:\SMARTDRV A+
       Path=a:\;w:
       A:\NET LOGON UserName Password
       A:\NET USE W: &lt;\\SERVER&gt;\&lt;ShareName&gt; /p:No
       Set Temp=C:\
<P>
       NOTE: &lt;\\SERVER&gt; is the name of the machine that contains the Setup
       /A (C:\WINSHARE) copy of Windows for Workgroups. &lt;\\ShareName&gt; is
       the name given to the C:\WINSHARE directory when it is shared. (See
       step 9 for more information.)

<P><LI>Edit the SYSTEM.INI file on the floppy disk and set the DEVDIR
    entry in the [Network Drivers] section to equal A:\.

<P><LI>Edit the SYSTEM.INI file in the C:\directory and delete the
    AutoStart=FULL line from the [Network] section.

<P><LI>Reboot the server machine and run Windows from the hard disk drive.
    Share the C:\WINSHARE directory from File Manager.

<P><LI>Boot a workstation with the floppy disk you created.
<P>
    NOTE: The first time you use this floppy disk, you must reenter the
    password you entered in the logon line in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

<P><LI>At the A:\ prompt, change to the W: drive and install Windows for
    Workgroups to this workstation's hard disk drive, or just run Windows
   from the floppy disk by typing "win" (without the quotation marks).
<P>
</OL>NOTE: If you need help using the network commands at the MS-DOS command
prompt, you type "net /?" or "net use /?" (without the quotation marks) to
access online help and syntax for most network commands.
