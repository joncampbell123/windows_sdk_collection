<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you are using a Creative Labs SoundBlaster Pro sound card with Windows
or Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 or 3.11, you may not see a Recording
Control slider in the Audio Control tool.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the View menu, click Detailed View.

<P><LI>Click Voice Commands.

<P><LI>Click the Line option button.

<P><LI>Make the changes you want and then save the configuration.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you are using a SoundBlaster Pro (or compatible) sound card with
Windows drivers, there is no level control for voice commands in the Audio
Control tool. Creative Labs uses an "auto gain" feature that sets the level
for you automatically.
<P>
By default, when you install the Microsoft Windows Sound System with a
SoundBlaster Pro sound card, Windows Sound System sets the voice commands
to the microphone. However, the microphone input on the SoundBlaster Pro
sound card uses an "auto gain" feature that does not allow you to change
the input. The Windows Sound System microphone, which uses an adapter to
amplify the microphone to a line level, is always plugged into the line
input of a true SoundBlaster Pro sound card because a true SoundBlaster Pro
sound card does not provide power through its microphone input. Generally,
you will want to use the Windows Sound System microphone for voice
commands, as well as for most microphone input, because the SoundBlaster
Pro sound card does not normally include a microphone.
<P>
Since there is no button for voice commands in the Audio Control tool in
this situation, it is difficult to change voice commands to line input.
Normally, you can double-click the volume control of the function in Audio
Control of which you want a detailed view; however, the Recording Control
slider is not present with the Creative Labs "auto gain" feature.
