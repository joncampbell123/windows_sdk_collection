<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
According to Intel Corporation, if you are running the NET SatisFAXtion
software version 2.5 with Windows for Workgroups version 3.11, you must
remove the IPX/SPX Compatible Transport for proper operation of the FAXNODE
software. The Windows CAS manager in NET SatisFAXtion is designed to work
with Novell NetWare and does not support use on a Windows for Workgroups
network. The FAXNODE software is designed to operate with a Novell file
called NWIPXSPX.DLL, which conflicts with the Windows for Workgroups 32-bit
version of the IPX/SPX compatible transport.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
NOTE: The configuration below should not be used if you need to run the
Windows for Workgroups network in conjunction with Novell NetWare or if you
need to communicate with other Windows for Workgroups or Windows NT
machines across a router. (NetBEUI is not a routable protocol where IPX/SPX
is a routable protocol.)
<P>
To work around this problem, Intel suggests removing IPX/SPX Compatible
Transport with NetBIOS in Network Setup. To do this, use the following
steps:

<OL><P><LI>In Program Manager, open the Networks group and double-click the Network
   Setup icon.

<P><LI>Choose the Drivers button and select IPX/SPX Compatible Transport with
   NetBIOS.

<P><LI>Choose the Remove button. Choose Yes when you are prompted for
   confirmation of this action.

<P><LI>Choose Close and then OK. Windows for Workgroups generates a message
   indicating that it has modified your .INI files and you should restart
   Windows to make the changes take effect.

<P><LI>Choose Restart Windows.
<P>
</OL>For more information about this issue and using other versions of NET
SatisFAXtion software with Windows for Workgroups, call the Intel FaxBack
service at either (503) 629-7576 or (800) 525-3019 and request fax #6120.
