ADDENDUM TO THE MICROSOFT SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT
<P><h2>FOR MICROSOFT WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEM VERSION 3.10</h2>
 
<P>
The files provided in this Application Note are intended to replace
the corresponding files provided with Microsoft Windows 3.10. Upon
installation, these files become a part of the Windows operating
system and are subject to the same license terms and conditions as the
Windows 3.10 product you previously acquired from Microsoft
Corporation. Any other use of these files is prohibited.
<P>
<P><h2>MICROSOFT WINDOWS VERSION 3.11 FILES</h2>
 
<P>
This Application Note includes updated versions of eight core Windows
3.10 files. To update these files to version 3.11, follow the
procedure below that is appropriate to your configuration.
<P>
NOTE: This update to Microsoft Windows 3.10 has been tested by
Microsoft in the MS-DOS/Windows environment only. We recommend that
users of IBM(R) OS/2(R) for Windows contact IBM's support facilities
for advice on how to proceed.
<P>
<P><h3>To update a local installation of Windows 3.10 to Windows 3.11</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Quit Microsoft Windows.

<P><LI>Create a backup directory. For example, to create a backup
   directory off the root of drive C, type MD C:\BACKUP at the MS-DOS
   command prompt and then press ENTER.

<P><LI>Copy the files listed below from your Windows SYSTEM subdirectory
   to the backup directory or a floppy disk.
<P>
<P><PRE>      COMMDLG.DLL
      GDI.EXE
      KRNL386.EXE
      PSCRIPT.DRV
      SHELL.DLL
      UNIDRV.DLL
      USER.EXE
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: After you copy the new USER.EXE file to your Windows SYSTEM
   subdirectory, your registered user and company name will be blank.
<P>
   To do this, use the following syntax
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy &lt;drive&gt;:\&lt;windir&gt;\system\&lt;filename&gt; &lt;drive&gt;:\&lt;backdir&gt;
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;drive&gt; is your hard disk drive, &lt;windir&gt; is your Windows
   directory, &lt;filename&gt; is the file you are copying, and &lt;backdir&gt; is
   your backup directory.
<P>
   For example, if your hard disk drive is C, your Windows directory
   is named WINDOWS, your backup directory is called BACKUP, and you
   are copying COMMDLG.DLL, type the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy c:\windows\system\commdlg.dll c:\backup
</PRE><P>
   Repeat this command for the remaining files.

<P><LI>Insert the enclosed WW0981 disk in the appropriate floppy disk
   drive. At the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following and then
   press ENTER
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy &lt;drive&gt;:\*.* &lt;destination&gt;
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;drive&gt; is your floppy disk drive and &lt;destination&gt; is your
   Windows SYSTEM subdirectory.
<P>
   For example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy a:\*.* c:\windows\system
</PRE>
<P><LI>If you use Novell(R) NetWare(R) connectivity, do the following:
<P>
   a. Use a text editor (such as Windows Notepad) to open your
<P><PRE>      SYSTEM.INI file, which is located in your Windows directory.
</PRE><P>
   b. In the [386Enh] section, change device=*vtd to device=vtda.386.
<P>
   c. Save the file and quit the text editor.
<P>
</OL><h3>To update a network installation of Windows 3.10 to Windows 3.11</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Determine the location of your SYSTEM.INI file and the network
   share that contains your shared Windows files. For example, if the
   network drive containing your Windows program files is Q, the
   location of your shared Windows files may be Q:\WINSHARE and your
   user directory may be Q:\USER\&lt;YOURNAME&gt; (or your user directory
   may be located on your local hard disk drive).

<P><LI>Quit Microsoft Windows.

<P><LI>Create a backup directory. For example, to create a backup
   directory off the root of drive C, type MD C:\BACKUP at the MS-DOS
   command prompt and then press ENTER.

<P><LI>Copy the following files from the network share to the backup
   directory on your hard disk drive using the following syntax at the
   MS-DOS command prompt and then press ENTER
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy &lt;netdrive&gt;:\&lt;netshare&gt;\&lt;filename&gt; &lt;harddrive&gt;:\&lt;backdir&gt;
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;netdrive&gt; is the network drive, &lt;netshare&gt; is the network
   share containing your SYSTEM.INI file, &lt;filename&gt; is the file you
   are copying, &lt;harddrive&gt; is your hard disk drive, and &lt;backdir&gt; is
   your backup directory.
<P>
   For example, if your network drive is Q, the network share is
   WINSHARE, the file you want to copy is COMMDLG.DLL, your hard disk
   drive is C, and your backup directory is called BACKUP, type the
   following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy q:\winshare\commdlg.dll c:\backup
</PRE><P>
   Repeat this command for the remaining files:
<P>
<P><PRE>      COMMDLG.DLL
      GDI.EXE
      KRNL386.EXE
      PSCRIPT.DRV
      SHELL.DLL
      UNIDRV.DLL
      USER.EXE
</PRE>
<P><LI>Remove the read-only file attributes on the shared Windows files
   using the MS-DOS ATTRIB command.

<P><LI>Insert the enclosed WW0981 disk in the appropriate floppy disk
   drive. At the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following and then
   press ENTER
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy &lt;drive&gt;:\*.* &lt;destination&gt;
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;drive&gt; is your floppy disk drive and &lt;destination&gt; is the
   network drive and share.
<P>
   For example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy a:\*.* q:\winshare
</PRE>
<P><LI>Reset the read-only file attributes on the shared Windows files
   using the MS-DOS ATTRIB command.

<P><LI>If you use Novell NetWare connectivity, do the following:
<P>
   a. Use a text editor (such as Windows Notepad) to open your
<P><PRE>      SYSTEM.INI file.
</PRE><P>
   b. In the [386Enh] section, change device=*vtd to device=vtda.386.
