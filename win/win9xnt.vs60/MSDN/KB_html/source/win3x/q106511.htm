                             INTRODUCTION
                             ============

</PRE>This Application Note discusses installation requirements for
Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11, the differences between
the Setup programs for Windows for Workgroups 3.11 and Microsoft
Windows operating system 3.1, new device drivers and files that ship
with Windows for Workgroups, and the Setup options /A, /N, and /H.
<P>
<P>
<PRE>                       INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS
                       =========================

</PRE>To install and use Windows for Workgroups 3.11, you must be using MS-
DOS version 3.3 or later. To upgrade from a previous installation of
Windows, your Windows version must be 3.1 or later, and your Windows
files must be included in your PATH statement. (If you have a version
of Windows earlier than 3.1, you need to do a complete Windows for
Workgroups installation, not an upgrade.) If you want to preserve your
Program Manager groups and other existing Windows settings, you need
to install Windows for Workgroups in the directory of your current
Windows installation.
<P>
<P><h2>DISK SPACE REQUIREMENTS</h2>
 
<P>
Windows for Workgroups 3.11 requires approximately 4.5 megabytes (MB)
more disk space than Windows 3.1. The following table illustrates the
disk space requirements for the most common installation types.
<P>
<PRE>Type of Installation          Windows 3.1    Windows for Workgroups 3.11
</PRE> 
<PRE>Full installation (286)            8.6 MB         Not Available
Upgrade 3.x (286)                  5.2 MB         Not Available
Full installation (386)            9.5 MB               18.0 MB
Upgrade 3.x (386)                  5.2 MB                9.0 MB

Network setup (setup /N)            .3 MB                1.2 MB

</PRE><h2>SUPPORTED NETWORKS</h2>
 
<P>
The following networks are supported for use with Windows for
Workgroups 3.11:

<UL><LI>Artisoft(R) LANtastic(R) (versions 3.x, 4.x, and 5.x)
<LI>Banyan(R) VINES(R) (versions 4.11, 5.0, and 5.52)
<LI>BW-NFS (version 3.0)
<LI>DEC(R) Pathworks(TM) (versions 4.0, 4.1, and later)
<LI>IBM(R) OS/2(R) Lan Server (versions 1.2, 1.3, 1.3 CSD, and 2.0
   without API)
<LI>Microsoft LAN Manager (version 2.1)
<LI>Microsoft Windows Network
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT(TM) (version 3.1)
<LI>Microsoft Workgroup Client (all versions)
<LI>Novell(R) NetWare(R) (versions 3.x, 4.0, and later)
<LI>Sun Microsystems(R) PC-NFS(R) (version 5)
<LI>TCS(R) 10Net (versions 4.1x, 4.2, and 5.0)
<P>
</UL>Before you run a shared copy of Windows for Workgroups that is
installed over one of these networks, read the following guidelines.
For some networks, you need to take some preliminary steps before
running a shared copy of Windows for Workgroups.
<P>
<P><h3>Novell NetWare Network</h3>
 
<P>
If you are running a shared copy of Windows for Workgroups on a Novell
workstation, be sure to log on to the Novell server before starting
Windows for Workgroups.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft LAN Manager and Windows for Workgroups</h3>
 
<P>
Before you run a shared copy of Windows for Workgroups on a LAN
Manager or Windows for Workgroups workstation, be sure to start the
network workstation services. You can do this with the NET START
WORKSTATION command.
<P>
If you are using the Windows for Workgroups network drivers, you can
start the workstation services automatically by placing one of the
following entries in the [Network] section of your SYSTEM.INI file:
<P>
<PRE>   autostart=full
   autostart=basic

</PRE>Setting AUTOSTART to FULL installs the enhanced network redirector.
The enhanced redirector supports named pipes and LAN Manager
application programming interface (API) functions.
<P>
Setting AUTOSTART to BASIC installs the basic network redirector,
which uses less system memory but does not support named pipes.
<P>
Neither redirector supports network messaging services or pop-up
messages.
<P>
LAN Manager automatically installs the redirector based on entries in
your AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS files. These settings are specified
in the LAN Manager network documentation.
<P>
<PRE>  NOTES

   - With Windows for Workgroups 3.11, you can connect to and use files,
     directories, and printers that are shared on a Microsoft Windows NT
     or a Microsoft LAN Manager server. To view the name of a LAN
     Manager server, at least one computer on the network must have a
     workgroup name that matches the name of the primary domain of the
     LAN Manager server.

   - Unlike in version 3.1, if you are running a shared copy of Windows
     for Workgroups 3.11, you cannot share your workstation's resources
     once you have started the real mode redirector.

</PRE><h3>Using Windows for Workgroups with a Different Network Operating System</h3>
 
<P>
In addition to the Windows for Workgroups 3.11 network functionality,
you can install Windows support for a third-party network operating
system. The network operating systems currently supported are:

<UL><LI>Banyan VINES (versions 4.11, 5.00, and 5.52)
<LI>BW-NFS (version 3.0)
<LI>Novell NetWare Shell (versions 3.x and 4.x)
<LI>Sun Microsystems PC-NFS (version 5.0)
<P>
</UL>No third-party files are included with Windows for Workgroups 3.11.
You must obtain all third-party network operating system files from
your network vendor. You must install the third-party network
operating system before you select the Windows support option.
<P>
<PRE>   NOTE: This procedure is not useful unless the drivers you obtain
   from your vendor are compatible with Windows for Workgroups.

</PRE>To use Windows for Workgroups with a different network:

<OL><P><LI>In the Network group in Program Manager, choose the Network Setup
   icon.

<P><LI>In the Network Setup dialog box, choose the Networks button.
<P>
   The Compatible Networks dialog box appears.

<P><LI>Select the Other option button under the heading "You can install
   Windows support for an additional network" and then select the
   network you want to set up. If that network does not appear in the
   list, select Unlisted Or Updated Network.
<P>
   You are then prompted to insert the disk containing the network
   driver supplied by your vendor. After you insert the floppy disk in
   your drive, Setup installs the network driver. The new network
   should then appear in the Available Network Types group.

<P><LI>Select your network and choose the Add button.
<P>
   This adds the network to the Other Networks In Use list.

<P><LI>Choose the OK button twice to exit the Network dialog boxes.
<P>
<P><PRE>     IMPORTANT: To use the new driver(s), you must reboot your machine.
</PRE><P>
</OL><h2>INSTALLING WINDOWS SUPPORT FOR A THIRD-PARTY NETWORK ONLY</h2>
 
<P>
You can install Windows support for a third-party network only;
however, you lose Windows for Workgroups peer-to-peer functionality if
you do so. You can install support for the following networks:

<UL><LI>Artisoft LANtastic (versions 3.x, 4.x, and 5.x)
<LI>Banyan VINES (versions 4.11, 5.0, and 5.52)
<LI>BW-NFS (version 3.0)
<LI>DEC Pathworks (versions 4.0, 4.1, or later)
<LI>IBM OS/2 Lan Server (versions 1.2, 1.3, 1.3 CSD, and 2.0 without API)
<LI>Microsoft Windows Network (version 3.11 Basic)
<LI>Novell NetWare (versions 3.x, 4.0, and later)
<LI>Sun Microsystems PC-NFS (version 5)
<LI>TCS 10Net (versions 4.1x, 4.2, and 5.0)
<P>
<P>
<PRE>                   DIFFERENCES IN SETUP PROGRAMS FOR
                   =================================
              WINDOWS 3.1 AND WINDOWS FOR WORKGROUPS 3.11
              ===========================================

</PRE></OL>This section discusses new features in the Windows for Workgroups
Setup program, including network detection and dialog box changes.
<P>
<P><h2>NETWORK DETECTION</h2>
 

<UL><LI>Windows for Workgroups 3.11 Setup performs network card detection.
   If Setup fails to detect your network card, it prompts you to
   choose from a list of available network adapters.

<LI>After a failed installation attempt, you can also force Setup to
   perform network card detection by using the /F switch (setup /F).

<LI>You can select No Network as a network type during Setup.
<P>
<P>
</UL><h2>DIALOG BOXES</h2>
 

<UL><LI>Windows for Workgroups Setup 3.11 asks for the computer name and
   the workgroup in the initial user name dialog box.

<LI>After Setup completes printer installation, the Install New Network
   Adapter, Network Adapters, and Compatible Networks dialog boxes may
   appear, as the following table illustrates.
<P>
<PRE>   Dialog box                    Express Setup    Custom Setup
</PRE></UL> 
<PRE>   Install New Network Adapter   Conditional      Conditional
   Network Adapters              No               Yes
   Compatible Networks           Conditional      Yes

   The Install New Network Adapter dialog box does not appear during
   either Express or Custom Setup if the Network Card Detection (NCD)
   utility detects your network card and you confirm the detected
   network card. Confirming the detected network card places a network
   adapter entry in the PROTOCOL.INI file. If you don't confirm the
   detected network card, the Install New Network Adapter dialog box
   appears. If you are upgrading from a Workgroup Connection or LAN
   Manager 2.1 installation, there is already a valid network adapter
   entry in the PROTOCOL.INI file, and this dialog box is skipped.

   The Compatible Networks dialog box does not appear during Express
   Setup if you are upgrading from a LAN Manager 2.1 installation.
   Selecting a network in this dialog box places a multinet= entry in
   the [Network] section of the SYSTEM.INI file. If Setup detects the
   existing LAN Manager 2.1 installation, Setup places the multinet=
   entry in the SYSTEM.INI file and therefore skips the Compatible
   Networks dialog box.

</PRE><LI>Once Setup is complete, the option to restart Windows is no longer
   available. (To load or upgrade network drivers, you must reboot
   your machine.)
<P>
<P>
<PRE>           SETUP OPTIONS (SETUP /A, SETUP /N, AND SETUP /H)
           ================================================

</PRE></UL><h2>SETUP /A AND SETUP /N</h2>
 
<P>
You run Setup with the /A and /N options to configure a workstation to
run Windows from a shared directory. Administrative Setup (setup /A)
copies all the files from the Windows distribution disks to a single
directory and marks them as read-only. This directory can then be used
to install and run a shared copy of Windows. Setup /N sets up the
shared copy of Windows.
<P>
In a stand-alone Windows 3.1 installation, the Windows directory and
SYSTEM subdirectory are on your personal hard disk drive. In a shared
Windows installation, the Windows directory can be located on the
user's hard disk drive or on a network drive, and can be customized
for each user. There is no SYSTEM subdirectory, as such, in a network
installation; system files are typically located in a shared directory
on a network server.
<P>
In Windows for Workgroups 3.11, as in Windows 3.1 running on a
network, the personal Windows directory contains all files with .INI,
GRP, and .PIF extensions, as well as REG.DAT, WIN.COM, WINVER.EXE, and
any MS-DOS device driver files. The personal Windows directory may
also contain the MS-DOS network device drivers and the NET.EXE,
MSIPX.COM, and NETX.COM files. (These files may also be copied to the
root directory of the boot drive, as explained in the following
section.) The shared directory contains all other Windows files.
<P>
<PRE>   NOTE: If you are setting up a third-party network operating system
   under Windows for Workgroups, you must place the necessary files
   provided by the third-party network operating system manufacturer
   in the shared Windows directory created by the setup /a command.
   When you run setup /n, Setup does not prompt you for these files.

</PRE><h3>Where Setup Places Network Files</h3>
 
<P>
The Windows 3.1 Setup program reads the SETUP.INF file to determine
where to install files. SETUP.INF uses the file classifications WINDIR
and SYSDIR to refer to files that Setup installs in the Windows
directory and SYSTEM subdirectory, respectively.
<P>
The Windows for Workgroups 3.11 Setup program reads the NETWORK.INF
file to determine where to install files. Setup places files with the
windir classification in the personal Windows directory and files with
the sysdir classification in a shared server directory. NETWORK.INF
also uses two new file classifications, NETDIR and DEVDIR. Where Setup
places these files depends on the type of installation.
<P>
Real-mode network device drivers (devdir files) are copied to the
personal Windows directory on a local nonremovable, noncompressed
drive. These include PROTMAN.DOS, PROTOCOL.INI, and WORKGRP.SYS. If
the personal Windows directory is on a remote, removable, or
compressed volume, then these files are copied to the root of the boot
drive. These device drivers must be correctly referenced in the
CONFIG.SYS file.
<P>
Real-mode network utilities and terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR)
programs (netdir files) are copied to the personal Windows directory
on a nonremovable hard disk. These include NET.EXE, MSIPX.COM,
NETX.COM, and ROUTE.COM. If the personal Windows directory is on a
remote or removable volume, these files are copied to the same
directory as the devdir files. These utilities and TSRs must be
correctly referenced in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file.
<P>
<PRE>   NOTE: If your personal Windows directory is on a remote volume, you
   still must have your own hard disk drive to run Windows for
   Workgroups. Windows for Workgroups does not support diskless
   workstations or systems without hard disk drives.

</PRE>The following table illustrates where Setup places the netdir and
devdir files for different installations.
<P>

</PRE><h2>BATCH MODE SETUP (SETUP /H)</h2>
 
<P>
You can use Setup with the /H option to automate the Setup program.
Windows for Workgroups 3.11 and Windows 3.1 come with a system-
settings template file called SETUP.SHH, which you can copy or modify
to create a custom system-settings file. In addition to the settings
specified in the Windows 3.1 template file, the Windows for Workgroups
template file includes parameters for the computer name, workgroup,
network card, protocol, and compatible network. The SETUP.SHH file is
located on Windows for Workgroups 3.11 Disk 1 and is copied to the
shared Windows for Workgroups directory when you run setup /A. You can
modify the template file with any text editor that can save
unformatted text (ASCII) files.
<P>
For more information about batch mode setup, refer to Chapter 3 of the
Microsoft Windows for Workgroups "Resource Kit."
