The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In File Manager, if you type a space on the To line of the Rename dialog
box and choose OK, Windows appears to delete the file. You cannot find the
file by searching for a space.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The file has not actually been deleted. Windows has renamed the file to
"current" (without the quotation marks) in the directory that the file
resided in originally.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To correctly rename the file:

<OL><P><LI>In File Manager, select the file named "current."

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Rename.

<P><LI>Type the new filename on the To line and choose OK.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows for Workgroups
versions 3.10 and 3.11. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
