The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
There are two instances in which you can close a running or minimized
MS-DOS-based application (either by choosing Close from the Control
menu or by quitting Windows):

<UL><LI>The application's program information file (PIF) has the Allow Close
   When Active option selected in the PIF's advanced settings.
<P>
  -or-

<LI>The application was started with SHIFT+ENTER or a double-click while
   the SHIFT key was held down.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Allow Close When Active option in the advanced section of the
application's PIF allows the application to be closed when it is still
running. This setting is not recommended for applications that need to
run in the background because the application does not have an
opportunity to save work when it is shut down.
<P>
NOTE: The Allow Close When Active option in the advanced section of
the PIF Editor is only available in 386 enhanced mode.
<P>
When you start an application with either SHIFT+ENTER or SHIFT+
double-click, it does not actually perform any functions until you
open it by switching to it (provided background operation has not been
enabled). Before you switch to the application, you can still close it
by choosing Close from the Control menu or by quitting Windows.
