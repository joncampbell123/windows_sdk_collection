<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
After using a third-party Windows screen font creation and installation
utility, such as Bitstream Fontware Installation Kit, to create and install
large Windows screen fonts, the text under the icons in Program Manager and
on the Windows 3.0 desktop, may become very large. This is because the
fonts that were being used originally were the wrong resolution for the
video driver that is installed.
<P>
You must install the appropriate set of screen fonts from the original
Windows disks by using the Control Panel. You can also use the
EXPAND.EXE utility to decompress the appropriate font files from the
disks by copying them to the Windows SYSTEM directory and modifying
the [fonts] section of the WIN.INI file, appropriately.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The screen font used for the text under the icons for Program Manager
is chosen from the list of available screen fonts in the WIN.INI, with
a preference for those fonts that match the screen resolution of the
video driver installed. For Windows installed using the VGA video
driver, the preference would be to use the font closest to Helv 8 (VGA
Res). This font is included in the file HELVE.FON. If that font is not
installed, the system will attempt to pick an appropriate substitute,
choosing from fonts with the correct resolution first.
<P>
When you install additional screen fonts that have been created for
the correct resolution for the Windows video driver, these fonts will
take precedence over other screen fonts that may be closer in size and
style to Helv 8 (VGA Res) but are at the wrong resolution.
<P>
For example, if you are running in VGA mode and the only Helv font
installed at VGA resolution is 24 point, the font under the icons in
Program Manager will use the Helv 24 (VGA Res) font even if there is a
Helv 8 (8514/a Res) font installed.
