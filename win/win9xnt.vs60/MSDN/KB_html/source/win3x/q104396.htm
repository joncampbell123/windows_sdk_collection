<PRE>1. Q. What types of fax modems can I use with Microsoft At Work PC Fax?

   A. There are three types of fax modems available: Class One, Class Two,
      and CAS. Microsoft At Work PC Fax supports all three types of fax
      modems. It is important to know which type of fax modem you have
      before you begin troubleshooting any problems. Microsoft At Work
      PC Fax supports different features depending on the type of fax
      modem you are using.

2. Q. I can't send or receive faxes using Microsoft At Work PC Fax.
      What could be causing this problem?

   A. If you cannot send or receive faxes through Microsoft At Work PC
      Fax, make sure that your fax modem is on the list of compatible
      fax modems. Also, check the ROM version in your modem by starting
      Microsoft Windows Terminal and configuring it for the port to
      which the modem is connected. Enter the command ATI3 and press
      ENTER. Compare the ROM version number reported back to the
      terminal screen with the README.WRI file packaged with Windows
      for Workgroups.

3. Q. I have confirmed that my fax modem is on the list of compatible
      fax modems and that the ROM version is compatible, but I still
      can't send or receive faxes using Microsoft At Work PC Fax. What
      should I do?

   A. If your modem and ROM version meet the requirements for use with
      Microsoft At Work PC Fax and you still cannot send or receive
      faxes, try the following steps:

      1. Be sure the fax modem works as a modem under other Microsoft
         Windows applications, such as Terminal or Cardfile. Also, try
         sending to or receiving from a different fax machine to determine
         if the problem is related to your fax modem or your phone
         connection.

      2. If you have a CAS modem, be sure that you have the CAS software
         installed in either your CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT file. Consult
         your modem user's guide for specific information about installing
         these drivers.

4. Q. I cannot send or receive binary files using Microsoft At Work
      PC Fax and my security features are unavailable (grayed out).
      Why is this occurring?

   A. Binary file transfer and security features are available only
      between machines running Microsoft At Work PC Fax with Class One
      fax modems.
