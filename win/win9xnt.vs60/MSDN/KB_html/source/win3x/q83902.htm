<PRE> this article applies to:

</PRE><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1 cannot be run on a
Novell nondedicated server. A nondedicated server is a computer that
operates as both a server and a workstation at the same time.
<P>
The following are two possible workarounds:

<UL><LI>Run Windows 3.1 on all workstations, and run Windows 3.0 in real
   mode on the nondedicated server.

<LI>Purchase another computer to be a dedicated server.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Novell NetWare allows a server machine to double as a workstation. In
this case, the server is called a nondedicated file server. However,
no extended or expanded memory is available to the workstation, and
Windows 3.0 can run in real mode only. Windows 3.1 does not have a
real mode and therefore cannot be run on a nondedicated file server.
For more information, query on the following words in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   win31 real stable

</PRE>Nondedicated servers are available with the following Novell products:
<P>
<PRE>   ELS Level I           (4 users)
   ELS Level II          (8 users)
   Advanced NetWare 286  (100 users)

</PRE>A dedicated file server functions as a file server only. A dedicated
file server is preferable because the processor time is not split
between the workstation functions and the requirements of the file
server.
