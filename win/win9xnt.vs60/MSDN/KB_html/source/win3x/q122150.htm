The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT versions 3.1, 3.5
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When your Windows for Workgroups 3.11 machine is configured with Novell ODI
drivers, and attempts to be validated by a LAN Manager or Windows NT
server, you receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   No domain server was available to validate your password. You were
   logged on without password validation.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This error occurs when you run NET START FULL before you start Windows for
Workgroups 3.11. When you run NET START FULL with ODI drivers, Windows for
Workgroups uses the IPX transport to obtain validation. Because Windows NT
3.1 does not recognize IPX/SPX (it recognizes IPX/SPX with NetBIOS),
Windows NT 3.1 does not validate the client machine.
<P>
NOTE: In this case, Windows for Workgroups cannot use NetBEUI and IPX/SPX
because they are protect-mode protocols and cannot be loaded from the
MS-DOS command prompt.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this problem, do one of the following:

<UL><LI>Upgrade to Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.5. Windows NT Advanced
   Server 3.5 can use the IPX transport without NetBIOS.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Load ODINSUP and NETBEUI. ODINSUP allows real-mode protocols, such as
   NETBEUI, to load so that the network can communicate with the Windows NT
   domain server through the real-mode protocol. Because Microsoft doesn t
   support the use of ODINSUP, this workaround has not been tested and is
   not supported by Microsoft.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Load the Novell implementation of NetBIOS (NETBIOS.EXE) from the MS-DOS
   command prompt. This workaround has not been tested and is not supported
   by Microsoft.
