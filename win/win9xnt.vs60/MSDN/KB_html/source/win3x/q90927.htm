The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Windows for Workgroups (WFWG) version 3.1 does not include
the functionality to join network segments, regardless of topology or
operating system.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Windows for Workgroups includes the functionality to connect a Windows
for Workgroups workstation to one or more separate network segments
through separate network interface cards. It does not include the
functionality to join these separate segments to each other.
<P>
<P><h3>Example of Connecting to Two Different Topologies</h3>
 
<P>
A Windows for Workgroups machine cannot be used to join multiple
network segments of different types. However, you can connect a single
workstation to two different networks. For example, you can use one
network card to connect a Windows for Workgroups workstation to a LAN
Manager Ethernet network using the NetBEUI protocol and then use a
second network card to connect to a Novell network using the MSIPX and
NetBEUI protocols. This  workstation can communicate with (and use and
share resources on) both networks, but it cannot join the two networks
together.
<P>
This type of connection is sometimes referred to as internal bridging
or routing. To connect networks of different topologies or operating
systems, you must use the correct hardware device. For example, to
connect an Ethernet network to a Token Ring network, you must use a
device called a gateway (which supports this function).
<P>
<P><h3>Example of Connecting to Two Different Segments</h3>
 
<P>
You cannot use a Windows for Workgroups machine to join multiple
network segments of the  same type. If, for example, a workstation has
two network cards installed (both of the same type, such as Ethernet),
you can connect 1 to 10 workstations on one segment (Segment 1) and 20
workstations on the other (Segment 2). The 10 workstations on Segment
1 will be able to communicate with each other, as will the 20
workstations on Segment 2. The machine that is connected to both
segments (through the two separate network cards) can communicate with
all 30 workstations, but it does not join the segments together in a
way that enables them to share and use resources on the other segment.
<P>
In other words, a Windows for Workgroups machine can connect to
different segments of a network, but it cannot replace a hardware
device designed to join network segments. To connect multiple network
segments, a device that supports this function is required, such as a
multiport repeater or Multistation Access Unit (MAU). The device is
specific to the network topology and existing network.
