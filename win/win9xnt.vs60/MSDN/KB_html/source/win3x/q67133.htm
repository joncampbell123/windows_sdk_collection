The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you select the Save Changes option while exiting the Program Manager,
the layout of the open group windows is saved, but the layout of the closed
group icons is not. These icons are automatically reorganized at the bottom
of the Program Manager the next time Windows is run. You cannot save their
screen positions, but you can save the order in which they appear on the
screen.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Using an example, the procedure below outlines the steps to order Program
Manager's group icons. Make sure you follow the instructions closely.
<P>
Groups in example:
<P>
<PRE>   Main
   Accessories
   Games
   WEP
   SDK Tools
   MS-DOS Apps

</PRE>Group icons we want to order:
<P>
<PRE>   Games
   Windows Entertainment Pack (WEP)
   SDK Tools
    MS-DOS Apps

</PRE>Desired order from left to right:
<P>
<PRE>   WEP
   Games
   MS-DOS Apps
   SDK Tools

</PRE><h3>Procedure</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Switch to Program Manager.

<P><LI>Restore ALL group icons to a window (do not maximize them).

<P><LI>Select the group window (from the Window menu is probably easiest
   at this point) that you want to appear on the far right; for
   example, SDK Tools.

<P><LI>Minimize this window to a group icon.

<P><LI>Repeat steps 3-4 for the next adjacent group icon; in this case,
   MS-DOS Apps.

<P><LI>Repeat steps 3-4 for the rest of the groups you want to order
   (first Games, then WEP).
<P>
   NOTE: At this point, the group icons should be the REVERSE of what
   you want.

<P><LI>Exit Windows and select Save Changes.

<P><LI>Run Windows.
<P>
   The group icons are now in the proper order. If you want to avoid any
   further screen changes in Program Manager, deselect Save Changes the
   next time you exit Windows .
<P>
</OL>In a general description, Windows 3.00 Program Manager keeps track of
which group icons you have minimized. The last icon you minimize is
put at the BOTTOM LEFT of the window IF you select Save Changes.
<P>
Technically, when you minimize an icon, its "order" is saved in a
"Last-In-First-Out" (LIFO) stack.  When you select Save Changes and
run Windows again, Program Manager reads the LIFO stack and places the
group icons in the window from LEFT to RIGHT, BOTTOM to TOP.
<P>
This LIFO technique is the reason the group icons were in reverse
order after step 6.
