The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
You may get the following message when trying to run Windows version
3.0 in 386 enhanced mode:
<P>
<PRE>   You must have the file WINA20.386 in the root of your boot
   drive to run Windows in enhanced mode

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
WINA20.386 is a file included in compressed format with MS-DOS version
5.0. The compressed filename is WINA20.38_. It should be copied to the
root directory during the MS-DOS 5.0 installation/upgrade. If it is
not, you will receive this message.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Use this procedure to reinstall the WINA20.386 file:

<OL><P><LI>Insert MS-DOS 5.0 Disk 3 (for 3.5-inch disks) or Disk 5 (for
   5.25-inch disks) into drive A or B.

<P><LI>Use the EXPAND.EXE utility provided with MS-DOS 5.0. From the root
   directory type the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      expand a:\wina20.38_ c:\wina20.386
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: You must use the EXPAND.EXE utility provided with MS-DOS
   5.0. If EXPAND.EXE is not in the DOS directory, do the following:
<P>
   a. Insert MS-DOS 5.0 Disk 3 (for 3.5-inch disks) or Disk 6 (for
<P><PRE>      5.25-inch disks) into drive A or B.
</PRE><P>
   b. Change to drive A or B.
<P>
   c. Type the following:
<P>
<PRE>         copy expand.exe c:\expand.exe

   d. Change back to drive C and follow the above instructions.

</PRE><P><LI>Start Windows (you do not need to reboot).
<P>
</OL><h3>Moving WINA20.386 Out of Root Directory</h3>
 
<P>
If the WINA20.386 file is in a different directory, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Add a SWITCHES=/W command to your CONFIG.SYS file.

<P><LI>Add the following line to the [386Enh] section of your SYSTEM.INI
   file:
<P>
<P><PRE>      DEVICE=&lt;&lt;drive:&gt;&lt;path&gt;&gt; WINA20.386
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;&lt;drive:&gt;&lt;path&gt;&gt; refers to the drive and path where the
   WINA20.386 file is located.
<P>
</OL><h3>QEMM and Windows 3.1</h3>
 
<P>
Using a version of Quarterdeck QEMM386 earlier than 6.0 with the NOEMS
switch causes a message to appear when starting Windows 3.1. Windows
is able to run in all modes, but a message is displayed stating that
the WINA20.386 file could not be found.
<P>
This behavior is caused in part by measures taken to work with earlier
versions of QEMM. When Windows starts, it sends two version messages,
one saying that it is version 3.0, and another saying it is version
3.1. When MS-DOS 5.0 intercepts the 3.0 message, it immediately checks
for the existence of the WINA20.386 file. MS-DOS does not need this
file if you are running Windows version 3.1.
<P>
The following are methods to prevent the WINA20.386 error message from
being displayed:

<UL><LI>Upgrade QEMM to the latest version (6.0 or later).

<LI>Add the following line to the CONFIG.SYS file:
<P>
<P><PRE>     switches=/w
</PRE><P>
