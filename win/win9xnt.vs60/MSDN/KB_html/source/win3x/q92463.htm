When you use Infinite Disk for MS-DOS from Chili Pepper Software, the
following error message appears when you try to run any program from

<P>

   Please reinstall this application.

</PRE><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>

<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Infinite Disk is a utility program designed to optimize disk space by
performing three types of activities on your hard disk:

<UL><LI>File aging
<LI>Automatic migration of qualified files
<LI>Automatic recall of any migrated file when opened
<P>
</UL><h3>File Aging</h3>
 
<P>
File aging is performed by IDRES.EXE, an Infinite Disk terminate-and-stay-
resident (TSR) program that changes the creation date of all files to the
date the program was installed.
<P>
<P><h3>Automatic Migration</h3>
 
<P>
Migration is the process of moving a file from one storage level to the
next.
<P>
<PRE>   Level 0 = Standard file with no compression
   Level 1 = A file that has been compressed by Infinite Disk
   Level 2 = A file that has been removed from the local hard disk

</PRE>Infinite Disk automatically migrates files from one level to the next based
on age criteria that you define during installation.
<P>
<P><h3>Automatic Recall</h3>
 
<P>
Recall is the process of decompression and/or restoring a file from a Level
1 or Level 2 migration.
