The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Your computer stops responding (hangs) when the Windows for Workgroups logo
screen is displayed.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem can occur if either your network card or Windows for
Workgroups installation is configured incorrectly. After you upgrade to
Windows for Workgroups, the network card may not respond, which causes your
system to hang.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To isolate and correct this problem, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Turn the machine off completely and then restart the machine
   (cold boot). This forces the network card to reinitialize and
   may correct the problem.

<P><LI>If you are running Windows for Workgroups version 3.1, start
   Windows in standard mode (at the MS-DOS command prompt, type "win /s"
   without the quotation marks). If you are running Windows for
   Workgroups 3.11, use "win /d:t" (without the quotation marks).
<P>
   If this corrects the problem, you may need to exclude the network
   card adapter memory range by adding the following statement to the
   [386Enh] section of your SYSTEM.INI file
<P>
<P><PRE>      EMMEXCLUDE=xxxx-zzzzz
</PRE><P>
   where xxxx-zzzz is the specific memory range for the network
   adapter. Use the value A000-EFFF for troubleshooting purposes.
   You may also need to exclude this memory range from your memory
   manager (for example, EMM386.EXE X=A000-EFFF).

<P><LI>The system may also hang if the network adapter is configured
   incorrectly. The configuration settings include IRQ, Base I/O
   port, and Base Memory Address.
<P>
   To correct your settings under Windows for Workgroups 3.1, delete the
   PROTOCOL.INI, PROTMAN.DOS, WORKGRP.SYS, and other Workgroup network
   driver files. Then, from Control Panel, choose the Network icon, and
   indicate the correct network adapter and configuration settings.
<P>
   To correct your settings under Windows for Workgroups 3.11:
<P>
   a. Start Windows for Workgroups by typing "win /n" (without the
<P><PRE>      quotation marks) and then press ENTER.
</PRE><P>
   b. In the Network group, choose the Network Setup icon.
<P>
   c. Configure Windows for Workgroups for No Network and exit Windows for
<P><PRE>      Workgroups.
</PRE><P>
   d. Rename the PROTOCOL.INI file to PROTOCOL.PSS. For example, type
<P><PRE>      "ren c:\windows\protocol.ini c:\windows\protocol.pss" (without the
      quotation marks) at the MS-DOS command prompt and then press ENTER.
</PRE><P>
   e. Run Windows for Workgroups.
<P>
   f. In the Network group, choose the Network Setup icon.
<P>
   g. Configure Windows for Workgroups for the appropriate network card
<P><PRE>      using the correct settings.
</PRE><P>
   h. Exit and restart Windows for Workgroups.
<P>
   NOTE: Each time the PROTOCOL.INI file is updated, the old one is
   saved with a sequentially numbered extension (that is, PROTOCOL.000,
   PROTOCOL.001, PROTOCOL.002, and so forth). Using this naming
   convention, you may be able to recover an earlier PROTOCOL.INI that
   was configured correctly.

<P><LI>Windows may hang if you have installed the incorrect NDIS NIC
   network card driver in your CONFIG.SYS file. To verify that the
   driver you selected matches the network card you are using, choose
   the Network icon from Control Panel. If the network card you are
   using is not listed during Setup, check the manufacturer's
   suggested emulation.
<P>
   The network card supplier may need to provide an NDIS-compatible
   driver. If the card you are trying to install is not listed in
   Control Panel, contact your network card manufacturer to obtain a
   specific NDIS driver that works with Windows for Workgroups.
<P>
   The order of the network drivers in the CONFIG.SYS file is also
   important. For example, protocol manager (PROTMAN.DOS) must be
   loaded before any other Windows for Workgroup network drivers. If
   PROTMAN.DOS is not loaded first, you may receive various error
   messages referring to the protocol manager.
<P>
   For troubleshooting purposes, remove the Windows for Workgroups
   network drivers from the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files. When
   you start Windows for Workgroups, you should receive a message
   about no network functionality. Accept the message and continue
   loading Windows for Workgroups.

<P><LI>If you still experience the problem, check to make sure that the
   adapter is seated properly in the expansion slot. Check for other
   hardware-related problems such as incorrect cabling, improper
   installation of T-connectors and terminators, and other connections
   within the workgroup.
