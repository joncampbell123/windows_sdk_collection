<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you install Microsoft Windows version 3.0 on a system with a bus
mouse, you may get the following message:
<P>
<PRE>   Problem with disk drive C: Please check that the diskette is
   properly inserted in the disk drive and the door is closed.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
A hardware interrupt conflict with the hard disk controller and a bus
mouse set to IRQ2 can cause this message. Many AT and 386 computers
use interrupt 2 (IRQ2) to communicate with the hard disk drive. If
your mouse hardware is also on this interrupt, you may have interrupt
conflicts. Some examples of mouse hardware that can cause interrupt
conflicts are as follows:

<UL><LI>A bus mouse card set for IRQ2
<LI>A built-in mouse port on the motherboard that is configured for
   IRQ2
<LI>A video card with a built-in mouse port that is configured for
   IRQ2 such as the ATI VIP VGA
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
The solution is to reassign the mouse to an unused interrupt. Do this
by resetting the jumpers on the bus card, or by using the software
setup program for the mouse. The owner's manual of the hardware
causing the problem should list the proper steps to change the IRQ.
