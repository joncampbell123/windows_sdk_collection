The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In File Manager, to view network directories and files with long names
greater than the MS-DOS standard convention, use the following entry
in the WINFILE.INI file's [SETTINGS] section:
<P>
<PRE>   longfilenames=1

</PRE>This information applies to LAN Manager version 2.1. This entry works
only for the LANMAN21.DRV driver used with Windows version 3.1; it
does not work with Windows for Workgroups.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This switch does not exist in the WINFILE.INI file by default and must
be added to see directories and files with long names greater than the
MS-DOS convention. The MS-DOS convention is eight characters followed
by a period (.), and then three more characters (for example,
FILENAME.EXT).
<P>
Many networks, such as LAN Manager networks running on OS/2 servers,
support directories and filenames greater than the MS-DOS standard
convention.
<P>
<P><h2>FEATURES OF LONG FILENAME SUPPORT</h2>
 

<OL><P><LI>You can rename a long filename to a shorter filename.

<P><LI>You can rename a short filename to a longer filename.

<P><LI>You can copy the long filename from one directory on the server to
   another directory on the server.

<P><LI>You can copy a long filename from the server to a local MS-DOS
   partitioned hard disk, but will receive the following message about
   needing to shorten the filename:
<P>
<P><PRE>      This path does not match the DOS format for filenames.
      Please enter a new name.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Windows 3.1's Association feature will not function on files with
   long names. For more information on the Association feature, refer
   to the pages 130-132 of the "Microsoft Windows User's Guide."

<P><LI>Windows 3.1 applications cannot open files with long names.
<P>
   Write displays the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>        This filename is not valid.

   Notepad displays the following error message:

        Cannot find LONGFILENAME.EXT.

        Do you want to create a new file?

   Answering either Yes or No, creates a new untitled document.

   Workaround
   ----------

   Rename the file to a short filename and then you can open it.

</PRE></OL><h2>FEATURES OF LONG DIRECTORY NAME SUPPORT</h2>
 

<OL><P><LI>File Manager will allow you to create directories with long names
   on the server after displaying the following message:
<P>
<P><PRE>      File Manager may not be able to access files created in
      the directory "X:\LONGDIRNAME".
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      Do you want to continue?
</PRE>
<P><LI>If a short filename or long filename file is located in a directory
   that has a long directory name, then the Run command under the File
   menu will be unavailable (dimmed).
