</PRE><h3>Introduction</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft Windows version 3.00 Swapfile does not work on Zenith
computers. For this reason, Zenith has manufactured its own version of
the Swapfile program. The enclosed disk contains the Zenith version of
SWAPFILE.EXE. The instructions below describe the steps to install the
Zenith version of Swapfile for Windows version 3.00.
<P>
<P><h3>Installation</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Exit Windows.

<P><LI>The SWAPFILE.EXE file on the enclosed Zenith Swapfile Disk is
   compressed in Windows 3.00 compression format. Decompress
   SWAPFILE.EXE and copy it to the appropriate directory by doing the
   following:
<P>
   a. Copy EXPAND.EXE from Microsoft Windows Disk #2 to your hard
<P><PRE>      drive (this utility expands compressed files to a usable
      format). To do this, insert Windows Disk #2 in Drive A and from
      the DOS prompt, type the following and press ENTER:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>         copy a:expand.exe c:\

   b. Remove Disk #2 and insert the enclosed Zenith Swapfile Disk in
      Drive A (or any floppy-disk drive).

   c. Locate the directory where SWAPFILE.EXE currently resides on
      your hard disk (usually C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM). Then (assuming the
      enclosed disk is in Drive A), type the following and press ENTER

         expand a:swapfile.exe location\swapfile.exe

      where location is the drive and directory where the Microsoft
      version of SWAPFILE.EXE resides -- for example, type the
      following:

         expand a:swapfile.exe c:\windows\system\swapfile.exe.

      The compressed file is expanded as it is copied to your hard-
      disk drive.

</PRE><P><LI>Follow the instructions on Page 522 of the "Microsoft Windows
   User's Guide" to set up a permanent Windows swap file.
<P>
</OL>For more information on the Zenith version of Windows, contact Zenith
Corporation at (800) 842-9000 for the nearest dealer who can provide
this information.
<P>
