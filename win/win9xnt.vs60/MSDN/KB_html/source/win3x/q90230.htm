The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
The following article contains information on the use of Windows for
Workgroups with third-party products or configurations that have not
been tested and are not supported by Microsoft.
<P>
If the steps or procedures described in this article do not function
properly, contact the manufacturer of the third-party product for more
information or use a supported configuration.
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article discusses the use of the following upper memory block
(UMB) managers with Windows for Workgroups (WFWG):

<UL><LI>EMM386.EXE
<LI>Qualitas' 386MAX
<LI>BlueMax
<LI>QuarterDeck's QEMM
<P>
</UL>All other UMB managers are not specifically supported.
<P>
Most of the UMB manager issues that apply to Windows 3.1 also apply to
Windows for Workgroups and are documented in the Knowledge Base. This
article addresses the following issues that relate specifically to
Windows for Workgroups:

<UL><LI>Excluding the Network Card UMB Memory Area
<LI>Reconfiguring the Device Driver and TSR Loading (the system stops
   responding at startup)
<LI>Using Stealth with QEMM
<LI>Using VGASWAP with 386MAX
<LI>Mixing Load High Methods
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Excluding the Network Card UMB Memory Area</h3>
 
<P>
Most net cards use some address space in the UMB. You may need to
exclude this address range so the UMB manager does not overwrite a
device driver or Terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) program. You can
use Microsoft Diagnostics to determine what address range your network
card uses, or consult your network card documentation. To determine
how to exclude a memory range, consult your UMB manager documentation.
To exclude a memory range using EMM386.EXE, add the following
parameter to the DEVICE= line in your CONFIG.SYS file (where yyyy-zzzz
indicates the address range):
<P>
<PRE>    x=yyyy-zzzz

</PRE>Reconfiguring Device Driver and TSR Loading
 
<P>
QEMM and 386MAX place device drivers and TSRs into predetermined
memory areas using memory optimization programs. If an Expanded Memory
Specification (EMS) page frame is present, these programs can also
borrow memory from the EMS page frame to load some device drivers and
TSRs. Windows for Workgroups device drivers load themselves into free
UMB space. This can cause conflicts with QEMM's and 386MAX's
optimization programs resulting in a system that stops responding
(hangs) at system startup.
<P>
To recover from this situation you must start the system from an
MS-DOS startup (boot) disk, edit your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT
files to remove all load high commands.
<P>
<P><h3>Using Stealth with QEMM</h3>
 
<P>
QuaterDeck's Stealth option for QEMM in implemented as ST:x on the
QEMM load line in the CONFIG.SYS file, where x is an single letter
parameter. Stealth is unsupported with Windows for Workgroups.
<P>
<P><h3>Using VGASWAP with 386MAX</h3>
 
<P>
VGASWAP is a 386MAX parameter. This parameter relocates ROM into
portions of the memory region usually reserved for VGA memory. This
parameter is unsupported by Windows for Workgroups but generally is
safe to use. The know limitation is that the network card UMB memory
area cannot be mapped to the area made available by VGASWAP. The
network card needs to be configured so it uses another area.
<P>
<P><h3>Mixing Load High Methods</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft does not support mixing load high methods. You should either
use 386MAX, BlueMAX, EMM386.EXE or QEMM. Mixing 386MAX, BlueMAX or
QEMM with the MS-DOS LOADHIGH command is not supported.
