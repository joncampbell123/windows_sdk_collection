The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When viewing the BOOTLOG.TXT file in the Windows directory, you may see the
following line:
<P>
<PRE>   LoadFail = NETAPI.DLL Failure code is 02

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This error code is placed in the BOOTLOG.TXT file during Setup. Error code
02 means that the file (in this case, NETAPI.DLL) was not found.
<P>
When setting up Microsoft Windows for Workgroups 3.11, Setup searches for
NETAPI.DLL. If Setup cannot find NETAPI.DLL, an error entry is placed in
BOOTLOG.TXT file.
<P>
When you run WIN /B, Windows for Workgroups appends the original
BOOTLOG.TXT file that Setup created. The failure code error remains in the
BOOTLOG.TXT file until the file is deleted.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
The "LoadFail = NETAPI.DLL Failure code is 02" entry in the BOOTLOG.TXT
file is added during Setup only. You can rename or delete the BOOTLOG.TXT
file so that a new file will be created when you run WIN /B.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The LoadFail error is recorded in the BOOTLOG.TXT file when installing
Windows for Workgroups 3.11 in the following ways:

<UL><LI>When you upgrade Windows 3.x to Windows for Workgroups 3.11

<LI>When you upgrade Windows for Workgroups 3.1 to Windows for Workgroups
   3.11

<LI>When you install Windows for Workgroups 3.11 to a clean directory
<P>
</UL>When installing over an existing Windows for Workgroups 3.11 installation,
this error is not recorded in the BOOTLOG.TXT file unless NETAPI.DLL is
missing or damaged.
