<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you select the Re-share At Startup option when sharing a floppy or
CD-ROM drive, and you start Windows for Workgroups without a disk
in the shared drive, the following error may be displayed.
<P>
<PRE>   System Error Cannot Read from Drive X.

</PRE>(where X: is the driver letter representing the shared drive)
<P>
If you choose the Cancel button, the following error message will be
displayed:
<P>
<PRE>   An error occurred while trying to share X. Error 5291. The
   path X:\ does not exist. Do you want to continue to share X each
   time you start Windows for Workgroups?

   -or-

   An error occurred while trying to share X. Error 5341. The
   path X:\ does not exist.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Windows for Workgroups File Manager allows the sharing of local
disk resources including fixed disks, floppy drives, and CD-ROM
drives. You can make these shares persistent by selecting the Re-share
At Startup option. If you select this option and the shared CD-ROM or
floppy drive does not contain a disk when Windows for Workgroups is
restarted, the above errors may occur.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To eliminate these error messages, make sure that the shared drive
contains a disk before starting Windows for Workgroups.
<P>
There are several ways to recover from the error condition, depending
on the intended result.

<UL><LI>To immediately reestablish the share, insert a disk in the shared
   drive and choose Retry in the System Error Cannot Read From
   Drive X dialog box.

<LI>To not reestablish the share for the current session, but attempt
   to reestablish the share in future sessions, choose Cancel at the
   System Error Cannot Read From Drive X dialog box and choose Yes at
   the Do You Want To Continue To Share X Each Time You Start Windows
   for Workgroups? dialog box.

<LI>To not reestablish the share for the current or future sessions,
   choose Cancel in the System Error Cannot Read From Drive X dialog
   box and choose No at the Do You Want To Continue To Share X Each
   Time You Start Windows For Workgroups? dialog box.
