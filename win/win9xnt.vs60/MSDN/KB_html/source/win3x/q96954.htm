The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Windows for Workgroups NET command contains support for real-mode
network functionality. It includes the real-mode network redirector
and the NetBIOS Extended User Interface (NetBEUI) protocol. This
article discusses the functionality of the following NET commands:

<UL><LI>NET START NETBEUI
<LI>NET START BASIC
<LI>NET START FULL (NET START ENHANCED)
<LI>NET START WORKSTATION
<LI>NET START REDIR
<LI>NET START /LIST
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>NET START NETBEUI</h3>
 
<P>
NET START NETBEUI loads the real-mode version of the NetBEUI protocol
into conventional memory. It does not load the real-mode network
redirector. If you start Windows for Workgroups with NetBEUI loaded,
most network virtual device drivers (VxDs) are used (such as
VREDIR.386 and VSERVER.386) except for VNB.386 (the NetBEUI VxD).
<P>
NET START NETBEUI hooks into the interrupt vector table at 5CH.
Programs often check 5CH to determine if NetBEUI is present and can do
so with the NET START NETBEUI command.
<P>
If you start Windows for Workgroups 3.1 without using NET START NETBEUI
first, the NetBEUI VxD (VNB.386) loads and provides NetBEUI support
but does not hook 5CH. Applications that use 5CH for NetBEUI detection
fail in this situation. Windows for Workgroups 3.11 hooks 5CH; therefore,
NET START NETBEUI should not be needed for most NetBIOS applications."
<P>
NOTE: Until you use the NET START WORKSTATION command or start Windows
for Workgroups, the network redirector does not load.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>NET START BASIC</h3>
 
<P>
NET START BASIC loads the real-mode network redirector into
conventional memory. If you have not already loaded a static protocol
stack (such as TCP/IP or XNS), NetBEUI also loads into conventional
memory.
<P>
NET START BASIC does not load support for named pipes and many LAN
Manager network application programming interfaces (APIs).
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>NET START FULL (NET START ENHANCED)</h3>
 
<P>
NET START FULL (synonymous with NET START ENHANCED) loads the real-
mode redirector into conventional memory along with support for named
pipes and other LAN Manager network APIs. As with NET START BASIC,
NetBEUI may install depending on the other protocols in use.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>NET START WORKSTATION</h3>
 
<P>
Using the NET START WORKSTATION command is equivalent to using NET
START BASIC (by default). The AutoStart= setting in the SYSTEM.INI file
specifies the redirector loaded by the NET START WORKSTATION command. If
you have no AutoStart entry in your SYSTEM.INI file, NET START WORKSTATION
loads the basic redirector.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>NET START REDIR</h3>
 
<P>
The NET START REDIR command starts the default redirector as specified
in SYSTEM.INI.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>NET START /LIST</h3>
 
<P>
The NET START /LIST command lists all network services that have
started.
