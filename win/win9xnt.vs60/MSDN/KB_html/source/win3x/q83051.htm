The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
A lot of time may be spent setting up object-linking-and-embeding
(OLE) information in the Registration database, especially if the only
way to reregister an application is to run its Setup program again.
<P>
It is necessary to preserve OLE information when reinstalling the
Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1. A new directory should
be created to install Windows 3.1 into, and the current REG.DAT file
should be copied into this directory before installing Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
All OLE registration information is stored in the file REG.DAT in the
Windows directory. Link information is stored with individual
documents that reference information in the Registration database.
<P>
If Windows 3.1 is installed over Windows 3.0 or Windows 3.1, then the
REG.DAT file is preserved and OLE and shell registration information
for the Windows 3.1 programs packaged with Windows are added to the
database.
<P>
The same is true if Windows 3.1 is installed to a directory that
already has a REG.DAT file in it. Therefore, if you set up a new
installation of Windows 3.1 (rather than an upgrade), a new directory
should be created to install Windows 3.1 into, and the current REG.DAT
file should be copied into this directory before installing Windows.
<P>
If Windows 3.1 has already been installed into a new directory, you
can copy the REG.DAT file from the old Windows directory to the new
Windows directory. Be sure Windows is not running when you copy the
REG.DAT file. Then use the following steps to update the REG.DAT file:

<OL><P><LI>Start Windows.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Run.

<P><LI>Type the following command in the Command Line text box:
<P>
<P><PRE>      REGEDIT SETUP.REG
</PRE>
<P><LI>Choose OK.
<P>
</OL>If there are more .REG files to merge into the database, use File
Manager to search for them and either double-click each one (press
ENTER), or drag and drop all of them (at one time or individually)
onto the REGEDIT window.
<P>
Until Windows 3.1 is reinstalled with OLE information, the old Windows
3.1 directory and all subdirectories should not be deleted because
applications are installing OLE servers in the Windows directory tree.
In addition, shared DLL files may be in the SYSTEM directory.
