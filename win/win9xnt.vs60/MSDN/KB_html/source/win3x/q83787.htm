The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Attempting to communicate with an internal modem using the same COM port as
an existing on-board COM port or a multi-I/O board can cause various
problems, depending upon the hardware and BIOS used. These problems can
occur even though nothing is connected to the physical COM port. Symptoms
associated with having duplicate COM ports include the following:

<UL><LI>The system hangs when you create a communications document, try to
   connect, or use an Autodial/Dial This Number command.

<LI>The system reboots when attempting to dial out or when the connection
   would have occurred.

<LI>The modem dials and rings but does not connect.

<LI>The modem initializes and dials but the message NO CARRIER is displayed.

<LI>A cursor is not enabled for Terminal under Microsoft Windows version 3.0
   or 3.1.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To correct these problems, do one of the following:

<UL><LI>Disable or reassign the on-board or multi-I/O board COM port. Consult
   your hardware documentation for information on reconfiguring the COM
   port.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Reconfigure the internal modem to use a different COM port, such as COM3
   or COM4. Consult your modem documentation for information about doing
   this. NOTE: Make sure that the IRQ of the COM port you choose is not
   being used by any other installed device.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Use an external modem.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Many PC motherboards ship with two built-in COM ports. Even though there
may not be an external connector for the second COM port on the back of the
case, the COM port circuitry is on these motherboards and must be disabled
to reliably use an internal modem on COM2. Reconfiguring the COM ports
usually involves changing a DIP switch or moving a jumper. Consult your
hardware documentation for more information about configuring the COM
ports.
