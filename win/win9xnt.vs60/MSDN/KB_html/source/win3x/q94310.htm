The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The Windows for Workgroups File Manager may show multiple WIN.INI files if
the WIN.INI file is renamed, moved, or deleted with File Manager. All the
files and directories previously listed correctly will be listed as WIN.INI
even if the screen is refreshed.
<P>
NOTE: This situation occurs only when the network drivers are loaded in
memory. If the network drivers are not loaded you can successfully rename
your WIN.INI file. However, if you rename it back to WIN.INI you receive a
general protection (GP) fault in WINFILE.EXE.
<P>
WARNING: Microsoft does not recommend or support modifying the WIN.INI file
in the above manner from any version of Windows File Manager.
<P>
Quit Windows completely before renaming, moving, or deleting the WIN.INI
file.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To restore the listings, exit and restart File Manager.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft does not recommend renaming, moving, or deleting core Windows
files (including WIN.INI and SYSTEM.INI) while Windows is running.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The only file that causes this behavior is the WIN.INI file. Renaming,
moving, or deleting other files does not affect File Manager's listing of
files and directories.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Load File Manager.

<P><LI>Open the Windows directory and select the WIN.INI file.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Rename.

<P><LI>Enter a different name for WIN.INI, such as WIN.BAK.

<P><LI>Choose the OK button.
<P>
</OL>All files and directories are now listed as WIN.INI.
