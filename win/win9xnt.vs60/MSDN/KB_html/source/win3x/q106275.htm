<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The following is the complete text of the Most Common Questions and
Answers about Microsoft Windows for Workgroups that was included as a
single sheet of paper in the shipped product.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Q: What network adapter information do I need to configure Windows for
<PRE>   Workgroups 3.11?

</PRE>A: You will need to know the following:
<P>
<PRE>    - Network adapter brand and model
    - Interrupt or IRQ
    - I/O port address
    - Base memory (RAM) address

   For more information about determining these settings, see the section
   "Configuring Your Network Card" in Appendix C "Installing Network
   Hardware," in the Microsoft Workgroup Add-On for Windows User's Guide.
   When Setup is run, it attempts to detect what network adapter (card)
   is installed on the computer, and how it is currently configured. You
   should verify the adapter brand and model as well as the adapter
   settings that Setup detects. If Setup cannot detect a network
   adapter, you should select the correct adapter and settings from the
   list of available drivers. If your adapter is not listed in the
   Network Adapter dialog box, you must obtain the proper NDIS-compliant
   or ODI-compliant driver from your network adapter manufacturer, or
   select a driver that is compatible with your network adapter.  Consult
   your adapter documentation or manufacturer for more information about
   the compatibility of your adapter with other adapter drivers that are
   available in Windows for Workgroups 3.11. Additional or updated
   drivers are also available on the Microsoft Download Service (or MSDL)
   via modem at (425) 936-6735.

   If you are upgrading over Windows for Workgroups 3.1, Setup will
   default to the adapter configuration used in that previous
   installation. Before beginning the upgrade, please check in Control
   Panel, Networks, Adapters, Setup and note the driver name and the
   current adapter settings.

</PRE>Q: What should I do if my machine hangs or locks up during Setup of
<PRE>   Windows for Workgroups 3.11?

</PRE>A: This could mean Setup had difficulty recognizing your hardware, or
<PRE>   there is a conflict with a TSR or device driver loading in the
   CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT. You first need to exit Setup by pressing
   the F3 key. If this does not exit Setup, restart the machine. See
   the section "Streamlining Your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT Files," in
   Appendix E, "Troubleshooting," in the Microsoft Workgroup Add-On for
   Windows User's Guide, for more information on creating a minimal
   CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT. You will then need to run Setup again
   and install Windows for Workgroups 3.11 into the same directory.
   Setup will automatically turn off some of its hardware detection
   capability to try to prevent a hardware detection problem from
   occurring again. If you still encounter problems during Setup,
   restart your computer and type the following at the MS-DOS command
   prompt:

      SETUP /I

   and press ENTER. This instructs Setup to disable all of its hardware
   detection capability.

</PRE>Q: After running Setup successfully, I am unable to start Windows for
<PRE>   Workgroups 3.11. What could be the problem?

</PRE>A: If you have completed Setup but cannot start Windows for Workgroups
<PRE>   3.11, see the section "Windows won't start after a successful Setup,"
   in Appendix E "Troubleshooting," in the Microsoft Workgroup Add-On for
   Windows User's Guide. This section list the most common causes of not
   being able to start Windows for Workgroups 3.11, and how to correct
   these problems.

</PRE>Q: When I start Windows for Workgroups 3.11, I cannot see other
<PRE>   computers on the network. What could be the problem?

</PRE>A: Listed below are some of the most common problems:
<P>
<PRE>    - An IRQ, I/O port address, and/or base memory (RAM) address
      conflict. See Appendix C,  "Installing Network Hardware," in the
      Microsoft Workgroup Add-On for Windows User's Guide for more
      information on configuring your network adapter.  See Appendix D
      "Configuring Network Adapter Drivers, "for information on changing
      the settings in Windows for Workgroups 3.11.

    - A cabling or connector problem.  See Appendix C, "Installing
      Network Hardware," for more information about connecting cables.
      You can also test your network cabling and adapter hardware by
      running the Microsoft Network Diagnostics utility included with
      Windows for Workgroups 3.11.  For more information on using this
      utility, see the section "Using Microsoft Network Diagnostics to
      Troubleshoot Networking Problems," in Appendix E,"Troubleshooting."

</PRE>Q: How do I configure Windows for Workgroups 3.11 to run with Novell's
<PRE>   ODI drivers?

</PRE>A: Windows for Workgroups 3.11 can use the ODI drivers to communicate
<PRE>   with both Novell Netware servers and other computers using Windows
   for Workgroups 3.11. Before setting up Windows for Workgroups 3.11,
   you must have the ODI drivers loaded and configured properly for your
   network adapter. You will also need to obtain support drivers that
   Novell provides for Netware functionality within Windows operating
   systems. Contact you local Novell reseller or Novell's CompuServe
   forums for information on obtaining these drivers. When installing
   support for Netware connectivity using the ODI drivers, Setup will
   prompt you for these files. If you are upgrading over Windows for
   Workgroups 3.1 or Windows 3.1, and had Netware connectivity enabled,
   these support drivers will already exist in your Windows directory.
   Setup will detect these files and will prompt you to choose to use
   these files, or install the diskette from Novell.  For more
   information on configuring Windows for Workgroups 3.11 with the ODI
   drivers, please refer to the  NETWORKS.WRI file, located in your
   Windows for Workgroups 3.11 directory.  This file can be viewed with
   the Write application in Windows for Workgroups 3.11

</PRE>Q: What is 32-Bit File Access and how can I get it running on my
<PRE>   computer?

</PRE>A: 32-BIT FILE ACCESS provides a faster way to read and write to the
<PRE>   disk cache in Windows for Workgroups 3.11 than SMARTDrive can provide.
   It provides a much higher disk access performance boost on compatible
   hard drive controllers when running Windows for Workgroups 3.11 by
   utilizing a 32-bit cache as opposed to SMARTDrive's 16-bit cache.
   However, SMARTDrive is still used for caching floppy drives with
   Windows for Workgroups 3.11.

   By default, 32-BIT FILE ACCESS is NOT enabled.  For more information on
   activating this disk performance enhancement utility,  see the section
   "Improving Performance," Chapter 8 of the Microsoft Workgroup Add-On
   for Windows User's Guide.

</PRE>Q: What are the PROTOCOL.CLN, SYSTEM.CLN, and WIN.CLN files in my
<PRE>   Windows for Workgroups 3.11 directory?

</PRE>A: PLEASE NOTE: These files should only be used if Windows for
<PRE>   Workgroups 3.11 worked properly after its initial install.

   The files listed above are created by Setup after it installs Windows
   for Workgroups 3.11 onto your harddrive. They are to be used if, for
   some reason, Windows for Workgroups 3.11 cannot start, or is not
   functioning properly after a change was made to one of three files:
   PROTOCOL.INI, SYSTEM.INI, and WIN.INI. To restore these files to
   their original settings, you need to first make a backup copy onto a
   floppy diskette of your PROTOCOL.INI, SYSTEM.INI, and WIN.INI files
   from your directory. Next, copy the PROTOCOL.CLN, SYSTEM.CLN, and
   WIN.CLN files in your Windows for Workgroups 3.11 directory to
   PROTOCOL.INI, SYSTEM.INI, and WIN.INI respectively. This will
   restore your files to their original settings.

</PRE>Q: I have a Hercules Monochrome, CGA,  or EGA video adapter, but this
<PRE>   driver is not available. Can I run Windows for Workgroups 3.11 with
   this type of display adapter?

</PRE>A: Yes. If you had a previous version of Windows 3.1 or Windows for
<PRE>   Workgroups 3.1, and had one of these video drivers installed, Setup
   will recognized this and will keep this driver for use in Windows for
   Workgroups 3.11. If this is a new install, you can obtain these
   drivers by downloading them from the Microsoft Download Service (or
   MSDL) via modem at (425) 936-6735.

</PRE>Q: I have a computer that I only use for MS-DOS-based applications. Can
<PRE>   I still have access to my Windows for Workgroups 3.11 network from
   MS-DOS on this computer?

</PRE>A: Yes. You will need to purchase the Microsoft Workgroup Add-On for
<PRE>   MS-DOS package from Microsoft, and install a compatible network
   adapter on the computer. This product allows you to connect to
   Windows for Workgroups 3.11 computers and printers, and also allows
   you to share your files with other computers on the network from
   MS-DOS. For more information about this product, please call
   Microsoft Sales Information Center (MSIC) at (800) 426-9400.

</PRE>Q: In the Network Drivers dialog box, it lists "IPX/SPX Compatible
<PRE>   Transport," or "IPX/SPX Compatible Transport with NETBIOS" as a
   protocol. Why is this installed and how is it used?

</PRE>A: In the previous version, Windows for Workgroups 3.1, a Windows for
<PRE>   Workgroups computer communicated with other Windows for Workgroups
   computers using the NetBEUI protocol by default. With Windows for
   Workgroups 3.11, a second protocol, either IPX/SPX Compatible
   Transport or IPX/SPX Compatible Transport with NETBIOS, is installed
   along with NetBEUI, if the computer has six megabytes or more of RAM.
   This allows Windows for Workgroups 3.11 to communicate with other
   computers that use either the NetBEUI protocol or IPX/SPX Compatible
   Transport. The benefit of the IPX/SPX Compatible Transport and the
   IPX/SPX Compatible Transport with NETBIOS is that either of these
   protocols can communicate across a router, whereas the NetBEUI
   protocol cannot. Novell Netware servers can act as routers between
   two different Windows for Workgroups 3.11 networks.
