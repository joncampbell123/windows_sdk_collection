The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use File Manager to copy or move files less than 512 bytes in size
to a write-protected floppy disk, the files are not copied to the floppy
disk and no warning message is given. Also, when you move files less than
512 bytes in size to a write-protected floppy disk, the files are not
copied to the destination drive but are deleted from the source drive
without warning.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in File Manager in Windows
versions 3.1 and 3.11. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
This problem does not occur in Windows for Workgroups 3.1 or 3.11.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, remove write-protection from the floppy disk
before moving or copying small files, or use an MS-DOS command prompt to
copy or move small files to a floppy disk.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you copy or move files of 512 bytes or larger to a write-protected
floppy disk, File Manager displays a warning message indicating that access
to the disk has been denied and suggests that the disk may be full or write-
protected.
<P>
When you copy files smaller than 512 bytes to a write-protected floppy
disk, File Manager displays a dialog box on the screen indicating that it
is opening, copying, and closing the files. However, File Manager does not
copy the files to the write-protected disk.
<P>
Moving files smaller than 512 bytes to a write-protected floppy disk also
results in File Manager displaying a dialog box that indicates it is
opening, copying, and closing the files; however, File Manager does not
copy the files to the write-protected disk, and, in fact, the files are
deleted from the source disk without warning.
<P>
NOTE: This problem occurs when copying or moving files from either a hard
disk drive or a floppy disk drive to a write-protected floppy disk.
