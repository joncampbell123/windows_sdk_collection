<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If a Microsoft Windows printer driver file is corrupted, you may have to
force Windows to replace it. The easiest way to do this is to modify
the [Installed] section of the CONTROL.INI file.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Control Panel maintains a list of all Windows 3.1 files it has
installed in the Printers and International dialog boxes. This list is
maintained in the [Installed] section of CONTROL.INI, as in the
following example:
<P>
<PRE>   [Installed]
   3.1=yes
   HPPCL5A.DRV=yes
   HPPCL5A.HLP=yes
   FINSTALL.DLL=yes
   FINSTALL.HLP=yes
   HPPCL5OP.HLP=yes
   PSCRIPT.DRV=yes
   PSCRIPT.HLP=yes
   TESTPS.TXT=yes

</PRE>If you remove the line "3.1=yes," all drivers are marked as old. If
you reinstall the printer driver, the corrupted driver is then
replaced with the functioning driver from the original disks. To
modify CONTROL.INI, use the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Edit the CONTROL.INI file with a standard ACSII text editor.

<P><LI>Locate the line "3.1=yes" and delete it.

<P><LI>Save the file and restart Windows.

<P><LI>Open the Control Panel.

<P><LI>Choose the Printers icon, then choose the Add button. Reinstall the
   printer driver.
<P>
</OL>The line "3.1=yes" informs Control Panel that the following list of
files were installed with Windows 3.1 (specifically with version 3.1
of MAIN.CPL, which comes with Windows). When a newer version of
Windows is released, Control Panel will know that all of the following
files are obsolete and should be replaced. If a file exists in this
section and this section was created with the current version of
Windows, Control Panel does not need to copy the file from the
original disks again.
