The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The following symbols appear as NetWare login drives when Novell NetWare
Connectivity is loaded in Windows for Workgroups and the line LASTDRIVE=Z
is included in the CONFIG.SYS file:
<P>
<PRE>  "[" and "]"

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Setting LASTDRIVE=Z conflicts with Novell NetWare NETX.COM and NETX.EXE
because they use drive letters after those set by the LASTDRIVE= statement
in the CONFIG.SYS file.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To correct this problem, change the line to LASTDRIVE=P, instead of Z.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The value of the LASTDRIVE statement is set to P by default when Novell
NetWare connectivity is loaded in Windows for Workgroups. The LASTDRIVE
statement specifies the range of drive letters you can use for connecting
to other Windows for Workgroups computers. For example, if your LASTDRIVE
is set to P, you can use letters from A to P to connect to other Windows
for Workgroups computers.
<P>
If you set up Novell NetWare connectivity, the letter that follows the
LASTDRIVE value is your login drive. (This is because Novell uses LASTDRIVE
+1.) For example:

<UL><LI>If LASTDRIVE=P, then your login drive is Q. Although you can use
   any letter to connect to NetWare directories, letters after the
   value of the LASTDRIVE statement (that is drives after P) are
   reserved for NetWare directories only.

<LI>If LASTDRIVE=F, then your login drive is G, and drives after F
   are unavailable for connecting to other Windows for Workgroups
   computers.
<P>
</UL>NOTE: If your login script(s) has been set up to use drive F as the login
drive, setting LASTDRIVE=P may result in errors during bootup. To resolve
those errors, change your login script(s) to reflect the login drive
change, or change LASTDRIVE to E. Please note the following limitations:

<UL><LI>If you set LASTDRIVE to E and your users have machines with single hard
   disk drives (C), you are limiting them to two network connections (D and
   E).

<LI>If you set LASTDRIVE to E, and your users have local hard disk drives
   with only two partitions (C and D) and a CD-ROM drive (E), they cannot
   establish any network connections.
