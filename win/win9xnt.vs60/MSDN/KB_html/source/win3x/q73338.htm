The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>

<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Accessing the Control Menu for Non-Windows-Based Applications</h3>
 
<P>
Page 21 of the Microsoft Windows "User's Guide" incorrectly states:
<P>
<PRE>   Do not double-click; if you do, the window closes or the icon
   is restored to a window.

</PRE>The statement should read as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   Do not double-click; if you do, the application will be restored
   to either a window or full screen.

</PRE>Double-clicking a minimized non-Windows-based application either restores
the application to a full screen or to a window.
<P>
<P><h3>Canon 300: Envelope Printing Procedure Changed</h3>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Windows "User's Guide" for version 3.1 incorrectly describes
the necessary steps to print #10 envelopes. The manual shows the envelope
being loaded horizontally into bin #1. The correct orientation for
envelopes is vertical, not horizontal.
<P>
NOTE: When the envelope size is selected, the driver switches to landscape
orientation automatically. This is the correct orientation.
<P>
<P><h3>Cardfile Size Limitations</h3>
 
<P>
The last paragraph on page 444 of the Microsoft Windows "User's Guide"
for version 3.1 states:
<P>
<PRE>   The number of cards you can store in a Cardfile file depends on the
   amount of memory in your computer and the amount of information on
   the individual cards.

</PRE>This is misleading. You are limited to 1260 cards per file and 52 bytes per
card. You can create new files, each with 1260 cards per file, until you
are out of hard disk space.
<P>
<P><h3>Clicking Outside a Copied Cutout in Paintbrush</h3>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Windows "User's Guide" explains how to use the mouse and the
SHIFT key to move a cutout in Paintbrush. The directions tell you to do the
following:

<OL><P><LI>Move the cutout and release the mouse when the cutout is where you
   want to leave it.

<P><LI>Click outside the cutout to paste the cutout permanently.
<P>
</OL>However, the guide does not explain that if you don't click outside the
cutout, it appears to work correctly. The cutout is pasted on the screen,
but when the file is saved, it does not save the newly pasted cutout.
<P>
<P><h3>Group Limitation in Program Manager</h3>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Windows 3.1 "User's Guide" (on page 76) and the Microsoft
Windows 3.1 "slim docs" version of the "User's Guide" (on page 74)
incorrectly state that you can add any number of groups to Program Manager.
Microsoft Windows 3.1 allows a maximum of 40 program groups and 50 program
items per group in Program Manager.
<P>
<P><h3>Incorrect COM Port Addresses</h3>
 
<P>
In the Microsoft Windows "User's Guide" for version 3.1, the communication
ports table on page 163 incorrectly states the common BIOS addresses for
COM2 and COM3. For COM2, it lists 03F8; for COM3, it lists 02F8.
<P>
The correct BIOS addresses and IRQs are as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   Port            Address    IRQ
   ------------------------------

   COM1            03F8       4
   COM2            02F8       3
   COM3            03E8       4
   COM4            02E8       3

</PRE></OL><h3>Incorrect SMARTDrive BufferSize Setting Hangs System</h3>
 
<P>
Page 540 of the Microsoft Windows "User's Guide" states that the valid
values for BufferSize can be any multiple of the ElementSize setting. The
guide provides no upper limit. However, there is an upper limit on the
BufferSize setting based on how much memory is available in the upper
memory area (UMA) or in conventional memory.
<P>
The valid entries for ElementSize and BufferSize are as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   If this value
   is used for /e        Use this value for /b
   ------------------------------------------------------------------

   /e:1024               Multiples of /e up to and including /b:16384
   /e:2048               Multiples of /e up to and including /b:32768
   /e:4096               Multiples of /e up to and including /b:57344
   /e:8192               Multiples of /e up to and including /b:57344

</PRE>If you try to use any other values, you may experience one of the
following problems:

<UL><LI>The system stops responding (hangs).
<P>
   -or-

<LI>The error message "Sector not found reading drive &lt;x&gt;" (where &lt;x&gt; is the
   drive being accessed after SMARTDrive is loaded) appears.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>The size of SMARTDrive's buffer does not match the BufferSize setting.
<P>
</UL>For additional information about SMARTDrive, refer to pages 539-541 in the
Microsoft Windows "User's Guide."
<P>
<P><h3>Location of Terminal Function Keys Incorrect in "User's Guide"</h3>
 
<P>
The Terminal function key chart on page 390 of the Microsoft Windows
"User's Guide" for Windows 3.1 incorrectly displays the F&lt;x&gt; (where &lt;x&gt; is
a value between 1 and 8) key layouts.
<P>
The Microsoft Windows "User's Guide" incorrectly state that the function
keys are located as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   F1              F2              F3              F4
   F5              F6              F7              F8

</PRE>The correct layout is:
<P>
<PRE>   F1              F3              F5              F7
   F2              F4              F6              F8

</PRE>NOHIGH in Windows 3.1 EMM386.EXE
 
<P>
On page 552 of the Microsoft Windows "User's Guide" for version 3.1, the
/nohigh switch for EMM386.EXE is documented incorrectly. The switch should
read /nohi.
<P>
The following error message appears if the /nohigh or nohigh parameters
are used with Windows 3.1 EMM386.EXE:
<P>
<PRE>   Invalid Parameter

</PRE><h3>Paintbrush Menu Bar Documented Incorrectly in "User's Guide"</h3>
 
<P>
The screen image on page 330 of the Microsoft Windows "User's Guide" for
Windows 3.1, was created with Windows 3.0 Paintbrush (PBRUSH.EXE).
<P>
The Paintbrush menu bar on page 330 contains the following menus:
<P>
<PRE>   File
   Edit
   View
   Font
   Style
   Size
   Pick
   Options
   Help

</PRE>The menu bar for the Paintbrush program included with Windows 3.1
actually contains the following menus:
<P>
<PRE>   File
   Edit
   View
   Text
   Pick
   Options
   Help

</PRE>The Windows 3.0 Paintbrush menus Font, Style, and Size have been combined
into the Text menu for Windows 3.1.
<P>
<P><h3>Program Shortcut Keys Work in Windows 3.1</h3>
 
<P>
Page 276 of the Microsoft Windows "User's Guide" for version 3.1
incorrectly states that CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+"character" is different from
CTRL+SHIFT+ALT+"character." Actually, these keystrokes are equivalent.
<P>
<P><h3>Shortcut Keys Work in Standard and 386 Enhanced Modes</h3>
 
<P>
The first sentence on page 276 of the Microsoft Windows "User's Guide" for
Windows 3.1 states:
<P>
<PRE>   When running in 386 enhanced mode, Windows provides a special feature
   called an Application Shortcut Key.

</PRE>The next paragraph documents how to assign a shortcut key with the PIF
Editor and with the Properties command in File Manager.
<P>
The first sentence on page 276 is only partially correct. Assigning
shortcut keys in the PIF Editor is available only in 386 enhanced mode;
however, assigning shortcut keys in File Manager with the Properties
command is available in both standard mode and 386 enhanced mode.
<P>

<P>
"Microsoft Windows User's Guide," version 3.1, pages 79-80, 276-277
<P>
<P><h3>Using Terminal in VT-100 Emulation in Windows 3.1</h3>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Windows "User's Guide" for version 3.1 incorrectly
states on page 386:
<P>
<PRE>   To use the function keys for DEC VT-100 (ANSI) terminal emulation,
   SCROLL LOCK must be turned on. If SCROLL LOCK is turned off, the
   function keys and arrow keys have normal Windows (not VT-100)
   functionality.

</PRE>For correct DEC VT-100 (ANSI) emulation in Windows 3.1, SCROLL LOCK must be
turned OFF, and Terminal Preferences must be set as previously mentioned.
<P>
<P><h3>Windows: How to Exit Print Manager</h3>
 
<P>
Page 232 (the Quitting Print Manager section) of the Microsoft Windows
"User's Guide" states the following incorrect procedures for exiting Print
Manager:
<P>
<PRE>   To quit Print Manager

   1. From the Options menu, choose Exit.

      If there are still files in the print queue, a message appears,
      asking whether you want to cancel printing these files.

   2. Choose the OK button to cancel printing and quit Print Manager.

</PRE>The guide should say:
<P>
<PRE>   1. From the View menu, choose Exit.

</PRE>All other information should remain the same.
<P>
<P><h3>Wrong Location for _DEFAULT.PIF</h3>
 
<P>
Page 238 of the Microsoft Windows "User's Guide" incorrectly states:
<P>
<PRE>   The _DEFAULT.PIF file is located in the Windows System subdirectory.

</PRE>The _DEFAULT.PIF file is actually located in the Windows directory.
<P>
Page 305 of the "Microsoft Windows Resource Kit Manual" is correct.
<P>
YES Button Appears, Not OK Button, When Clearing Clipboard
 
<P>
Step 5 of "To clear the Clipboard" on page 63 of Chapter 2 in the Microsoft
Windows "User's Guide" for Windows 3.1 is incorrect. It states the
following:
<P>
<PRE>   To clear the Clipboard:

   1. Switch to Program Manager.

   2. Open the Main group.

   3. Choose the Clipboard Viewer icon.

   4. From the Edit menu, choose Delete or press DEL.

   5. Choose the OK button.

</PRE>Step 5 is incorrect, the program does not prompt a dialog with an OK
option. After the Clear Clipboard dialog box appears, there is a prompt for
Yes or No.
<P>
Step 5 should state the following:
<P>
<PRE>   5. Choose the Yes button.
