The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Windows for Workgroups 3.11 supports multiple network drivers and can
co-exist with other network products, such as Beame and Whiteside NFS
(BW-NFS), version 3.0c.
<P>
After you upgrade to Windows for Workgroups 3.11, your BW-NFS connectivity
may not exist. This article describes procedures to correct this problem
that are based on information provided by Beame and Whiteside. If you want
to use ODI interface (running Novell NetWare, BW-NFS, and Windows for
Workgroups 3.11), contact Beame and Whiteside for configuration
recommendations.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>CONFIG.SYS File Changes</h3>
 
<P>
Make the following changes in your CONFIG.SYS file by either remarking out
(with the REM command) or deleting the lines shown below.
<P>
NOTE: The following information assumes that your BW-NFS files are in a
directory called C:\BW30c.
<P>
<PRE>   rem DEVICE=C:\BW30c\NDIS\PROTMAN.DOS
   rem DEVICE=C:\BW30C\NDIS\&lt;ELNK3.DOS&gt;   (where &lt;ELNK3.DOS&gt; is your
                                          specific network card driver)
   rem DEVICE=C:\BW30C\ETHDEV.SYS
   rem DEVICE=C:\BW30C\TCPIP.SYS 1460

</PRE><h3>SYSTEM.INI File Changes</h3>
 
<P>
Verify that your SYSTEM.INI file contains the following lines.
<P>
NOTE: You must copy the ETHDEV.SYS and TCPIP.SYS files to the directory
specified on the DEVDIR= line in the [network drivers] section of your
SYSTEM.INI file. The following is an example and assumes that the Windows
for Workgroups 3.11 network is also installed:
<P>
<PRE>   [boot]
   network.drv=wfwnet.drv
   secondnet=bwnet.drv

   [boot.description]
   network.drv=Microsoft Windows Network (version 3.11)
   secondnet.drv=BW-NFS Network File System (version 3.0)

   [386Enh]
   network=*vnetbios,*vwc,vnetsup.386,vredir.386,vserver.386
   secondnet=bwdosnet.386,bwredir.386
   TimerCriticalSection=1000
   UniqueDOSPSP=TRUE
   PSPIncrement=5

   [Network]
   winnet=wfwnet/00025100
   multinet=bwnfs

   [network drivers]
   transport=ethdev.sys,tcpip.sys 1460,ndishlp.sys,*netbeui
   devdir=C:\Windows
   LoadRMDrivers=Yes

</PRE><h3>PROTOCOL.INI File Changes</h3>
 
<P>
Verify that your PROTOCOL.INI file located in the Windows directory
contains the following lines.
<P>
NOTE: The following is an example that uses a Western Digital Plus Family
Adapter. Your network adapter may differ and may have a different section
name and settings under that section.
<P>
[protocol manager]
drivername=PROTMAN$
<P>
<PRE>[WD8003XMAC]                  ;This section varies depending on the
drivername=MACWD$             ;network adapter used in your system.
</PRE>irq=5
ramaddress=CC00
iobase=0X280
<P>
[ETHDEV]
drivername=ETHDEV27
<PRE>bindings=WD8003XMAC           ;This line must be identical to the
                              ;adapter name section in brackets
                              ;above. This line is case sensitive.

</PRE><h3>AUTOEXEC.BAT File Changes</h3>
 
<P>
Remark out any NETBIND= lines in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.
<P>
If you are running only the TCP portion of the BW-NFS software, you should
remove the BWRPC and BWNFS drivers from the AUTOEXEC.BAT file.
<P>
If you are using the NFS portion of the BW-NFS software, you should remove
the BWSTART line from your AUTOEXEC.BAT file. There should be a
C:\WINDOWS\NET START line only. If you see another similar line that is
pointing to the BW-NFS directory, either remark out or delete that line.
<P>
<P><h3>Rename Your Files</h3>
 
<P>
Regardless of the installation (ODI or NDIS), in the BW-NFS directory,
rename the NET.EXE file to NFS.EXE and the STARTNET.EXE to BWSTART.EXE.
This eliminates potential conflicts with Windows for Workgroups drivers.
<P>
NOTE: BW-NFS version 3.1 uses STARTNET.COM instead of STARTNET.EXE.
<P>
<P><h3>Save Your Changes and Reboot</h3>
 
<P>
Save all changes to your files and reboot your computer. Your Beame and
Whiteside connectivity should then be restored.
<P>
For more information, contact Beame and Whiteside Software, Inc.
