<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Norton Desktop for Windows (NDW) versions 1.x and 2.0 create two sets
of backup files to store the configuration of both the MS-DOS
environment and the Microsoft Windows environment.
<P>
The first set of files have the .ND0 file extension. These files are
the original configuration files that were used by both MS-DOS and
Windows prior to the original installation of Norton Desktop for
Windows.
<P>
For Norton Desktop for Windows 1.0, you have the following files:
<P>
<PRE>   AUTOEXEC.ND0
   CONFIG.ND0
   WIN.ND0
   SYSTEM.ND0

</PRE>For Norton Desktop for Windows 2.0, you have the following files:
<P>
<PRE>   CONFIG.NDW
   AUTOEXEC.NDW
   WIN.NDW
   SYSTEM.NDW

</PRE>The second set of files have the .NDW file extension. The .NDW files
are the configuration files prior to the most recent installation of
Norton Desktop for Windows. These files are replaced with subsequent
installation of Norton Desktop for Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To return Windows and MS-DOS to the state they were in before Norton
Desktop for Windows was installed, copy the *.ND0 files to the
original system files with the appropriate extension. For example, to
restore the AUTOEXEC.BAT file, type the following at the MS-DOS
command prompt:
<P>
<PRE>   copy autoexec.nd0 autoexec.bat

</PRE>You will be left with a number of extraneous files in the various
directories; however, Windows will run as it originally did.
<P>
For more information of removing all Norton Desktop for Windows
files, query on the following words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

</PRE>Norton Desktop for Windows is manufactured by a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this
product's performance or reliability.
