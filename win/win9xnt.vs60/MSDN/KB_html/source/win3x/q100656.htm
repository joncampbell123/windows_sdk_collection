The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
The following article contains information on the use of Windows for
Workgroups with third-party products or configurations that have not been
tested and are not supported by Microsoft.
<P>
If the steps or procedures described in this article do not function
properly, contact the manufacturer of the third-party product for more
information.
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you print to a remote Lexmark IBM 4037 or 4039 printer from a Windows
for Workgroups machine using the PCL 5 language driver that comes with the
printer, you receive one of the following error messages:

<UL><LI>Error writing to LPT1
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Printer port is offline or disconnected
<P>
</UL><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To eliminate either of these error messages, change the driver settings.
<P>
NOTE: The 4039 PostScript printer drivers do not require any changes.
<P>
The Lexmark IBM 4039 line of printers ship with an accelerated printer
driver (a PCL 5 driver specific to the 4039 printers) and a PostScript
driver. To use the accelerated driver to print to a Lexmark IBM 4039
printer over a Windows for Workgroups network, you must disable the Fast
Printing Direct To Port option on the client machine. To do this, use the
following steps:

<OL><P><LI>In Control Panel, choose the Printers icon.

<P><LI>Select the IBM 4039 Print Accelerator Driver. (This is the PCL 5
   language driver that comes with the printer.)

<P><LI>Choose the Setup button and then the Options button.

<P><LI>Clear the Fast Printing Direct To Port check box.
<P>
</OL>NOTES:

<UL><LI>This change does not need to be made on the system that is sharing the
   Lexmark 4039 printer.

<LI>According to the "Software Application Driver Information Manual" from
   IBM, the 4019 and 4029 printer drivers do not work with the 4039
   printer.
