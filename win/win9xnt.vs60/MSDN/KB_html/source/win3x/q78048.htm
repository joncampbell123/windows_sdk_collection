The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Macros recorded with the Microsoft Windows Recorder program are more
reliable when created using keystrokes, than macros created using
equivalent mouse operations.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Macros based on mouse operations are dependent upon the locations and sizes
of objects on the desktop. The sizes and location of objects tend to change
for each Windows session and user. Therefore using these as reference
points may result in Recorder macro errors, such as the following:
<P>
<PRE>   Playback window does not exist

</PRE>Keystroke-based macros do not depend on the locations or sizes of objects;
thus, they are not sensitive to changes in these reference points.
<P>
<P><h3>Example of Keystroke Macro</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Execute the Recorder program.

<P><LI>Minimize Program Manager.

<P><LI>From the Recorder menu, choose Macro Record.

<P><LI>Begin recording the macro, using the following settings:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Playback (Group Box)
</PRE><P>
<PRE>      To:                 Same Application
      Speed:              Fast
      Record Mouse:       Everything
      Relative to:        Screen

</PRE><P><LI>While holding down the ALT key, press the TAB key repeatedly until
   Program Manager is highlighted. Release both ALT and TAB to restore
   Program Manager.

<P><LI>Press ALT+F, R to choose Run from Program Manager's File menu.

<P><LI>Type
<P>
<P><PRE>      clock.exe
</PRE><P>
   and press ENTER to run the Clock program.

<P><LI>Type CTRL+BREAK to stop recording.

<P><LI>Save the macro.
<P>
</OL>Steps 1-4 must be performed because the Program Manager may be minimized at
the start of the macro. If so, it will not respond to the File Run command
given in step 5. These steps ensure the Program Manager is open.
