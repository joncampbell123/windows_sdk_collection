<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
There is no direct method to print a listing of files or directories from
Microsoft Windows File Manager.
<P>
To work around this limitation, you can print the list of files using a
batch file. Or, if the file list is short enough, you can press the
ALT+PRINT SCREEN key combination to copy the active File Manager window,
paste the information into Microsoft Windows Paintbrush, and then print the
bitmap from Paintbrush.
<P>
If you are using Windows 3.0 or 3.0a, you can print the list of files from
MS-DOS Executive (MSDOS.EXE).
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Printing from a Batch File</h3>
 
<P>
You can print a directory listing in Windows by creating an MS-DOS batch
file with the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Using a text editor such as Microsoft Windows Notepad, create a batch
   file with the following line:
<P>
<P><PRE>      DIR %1 &gt; LPT1 (or another appropriate printer port)
</PRE>
<P><LI>Save the file as DIRPRINT.BAT in a directory that is in your PATH
   statement.

<P><LI>In File Manager, choose Run from the File menu.

<P><LI>Type the following
<P>
<P><PRE>      dirprint.bat &lt;drive&gt;:&lt;path&gt;&lt;directory&gt;
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;drive&gt;:&lt;path&gt;&lt;directory&gt; points to the directory you want to
   print. For example, type the following to print a listing of the Windows
   directory on drive C:
<P>
<P><PRE>      dirprint.bat c:\windows
</PRE>
<P><LI>An MS-DOS screen appears briefly and then a batch file is run,
   sending the directory information to the printer. You are then
   returned to File Manager.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: This procedure does not work with PostScript printers. Refer to the
"Printing to a PostScript Printer" section below for more information.
<P>
<P><h3>Printing from MS-DOS Executive</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft Windows MS-DOS Executive is included with Windows versions 3.0
and 3.0a but not later versions. If you upgraded from Windows 3.0, you may
still have the MS-DOS Executive file (MSDOS.EXE) in your Windows program
directory. If you do not have MS-DOS Executive, you can obtain it from the
Windows Driver Library. (For a complete listing of the WDL's contents and
instructions for obtaining the WDL, query on "<B><A href="../win3x/q82006.htm">Q82006</A></B>" [without the
quotation marks] in the Microsoft Knowledge Base.)
<P>
MS-DOS Executive is the operating shell for earlier versions of Windows. MS-
DOS Executive can print directory listings that include all the files in
that directory plus a listing of all subdirectories in that directory. The
only directory MSDOS.EXE cannot print is the root directory.
<P>
To use MSDOS.EXE for printing directories:

<OL><P><LI>In Program Manager, choose Run from the File menu.

<P><LI>In the Command Line box, type the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      msdos.exe
</PRE><P>
   This file should be in the Windows program directory.

<P><LI>When MS-DOS Executive is running, choose the directory that you want to
   print, then choose Print from the File menu.
<P>
</OL><h3>Printing to a PostScript Printer</h3>
 
<P>
If you are using a PostScript printer, follow the procedure below to
print a directory.

<OL><P><LI>Exit to the MS-DOS prompt.

<P><LI>Type the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      dir {path}  &gt; dirlist.dat"
</PRE>
<P><LI>Type "exit" (without the quotation marks).

<P><LI>In Windows, run Notepad, and open the file.

<P><LI>Print the file to your PostScript printer.
<P></OL>
