The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The following information describes the Intel EtherExpress 16 Network
card specifications. For more information about this Network card,
contact Intel Corporation.
<P>
<P><h2>PHYSICAL SPECIFICATIONS</h2>
 
<P>
The Intel EtherExpress 16 is a half-slot board. It is short enough to
allow an adjacent board to use a piggyback card that is also half
length. The board is 4.2 inches tall and 6.5 inches long.
<P>
<P><h2>CONNECTORS</h2>
 
<P>
The board has two external connectors:
<P>
<PRE>DIX:    A 15-pin, D-shaped connector for AUI interfaced to thick
        Ethernet cables

BNC:    A cylindrical, bayonet connector for interfacing to thin Ethernet
        or Cheapernet cables

</PRE><h2>FCC COMPLIANCE</h2>
 
<P>
The board is an FCC Class B device, making it suitable for use in both
commercial and residential applications.
<P>
<P><h2>ENVIRONMENTAL SPECIFICATIONS</h2>
 
<P>
The board can operate under the following environmental conditions:
<P>
<PRE>   Operating Temperature:  0 to 50 degrees centigrade
   Operating Humidity:     10 to 90 percent, non-condensing

</PRE><h2>MEMORY ON BOARD</h2>
 
<P>
The board has 32K bytes of RAM on it. While this memory is used to
buffer the communications between the board and the network (whether
you select memory-mapped or I/O-mapped buffering), Intel recommends
using I/O-mapped buffering.
<P>
<P><h2>ELECTRICAL SPECIFICATIONS</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Bus Characteristics</h3>
 
<P>
The board works in 8- or 16-bit Industry Standard Architecture (ISA)
busses. This is the same bus that is used on IBM PCs (8 bit) and IBM
PC/ATs (8-bit or 16-bit). The board also works in EISA computers
(because EISA computers are designed to accept both ISA and EISA
boards).
<P>
<P><h3>Slot Characteristics</h3>
 
<P>
Use a 16-bit slot whenever possible because it provides faster
transfer of data between the computer and the network. If a 16-bit
slot is not available, an 8-bit slot works, but at lower performance.
<P>
<P><h2>WORST-CASE POWER CONSUMPTION</h2>
 
<P>
Power consumption depends upon the kind of connector being used. The
table below shows worst-case power consumption.
<P>
<PRE>   Connector                    Worst-Case Consumption in mA
   ---------------------------------------------------------

   BNC                          610 @ +5V
                                215 @ +12V
   DIX                          610 @ +5V
                                *variable @ +12V

</PRE>* When the DIX connector is used, the board does not consume any power
<PRE>  at +12V. It simply passes it through to power any external
  transceiver connected to the AUI cable. To provide you with a means
  of estimating the amount of power likely to be consumed, the following
  table shows the power consumption for external transceivers made by
  three different manufacturers:

   Manufacturer         Model                   Power Consumed
   -----------------------------------------------------------

   Intel                External                150 mA
   Synoptics            508 10BASE-T            420 mA
   HP                   ThinMAU 28641A          270 mA

</PRE><h2>CABLE SPECIFICATIONS</h2>
 
<P>
Each connector requires a different kind of cable. Here are the
specifications for the cable required for each kind of connector.
<P>
<P><h3>Cable for DIX Connectors</h3>
 
<P>
DIX connectors use the standard transceiver cable or AUI cable
conforming to the 10BASE-5 specification. An example suitable
cable is Belden 9898. The maximum distance between the computer
and the transceiver on the thick Ethernet cable is 50 meters.
<P>
<P><h3>Cable for BNC Connectors</h3>
 
<P>
BNC connectors require RG-58 coaxial cable conforming to the
10BASE-2 specification. This is sometimes called thin Ethernet
or Cheapernet cable. The layout of the network must conform to
the following specifications:

<UL><LI>Maximum trunk length with repeaters in the network: 300 meters
<LI>Maximum trunk length without repeaters in the network: 185 meters
<LI>Minimum distance between nodes: 1 meter
<P>
</UL>This information was obtained from "The Complete Guide to Installing
and Configuring the Intel ExtherExpress 16 and 16TP Network Adapters
for ISA Computers." The installation guide is available from Intel
Corporation.
