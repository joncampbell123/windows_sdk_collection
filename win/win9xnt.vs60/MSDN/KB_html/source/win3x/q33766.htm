The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 2.x, 3.0, 3.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
You cannot open a file that does not have an extension by double-clicking
it in the MS-DOS Executive. The extension list in the WIN.INI file will not
recognize an empty extension.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To open a file without an extension, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Determine which application created the file.

<P><LI>Open that application by either double clicking the EXE file in the
   Windows MS-DOS executive with a mouse, or highlight the file in the
   MS-DOS executive and press ENTER. If the file was created by an
   MS-DOS application, then either double-click the PIF file with the
   mouse, or highlight the PIF file and press ENTER.

<P><LI>After the application is open, open the file using the commands
   specific to that particular application.
<P>
</OL>Another alternative is to rename the file without the extension so
that it has an extension. To rename the file, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Highlight the file without the extension.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Rename.

<P><LI>A dialog box will appear, showing the name of the file to be
   renamed and requesting the new name. Type the new filename WITH the
   extension and press ENTER.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: This information applies to Microsoft Windows versions 2.03, 2.1,
2.11, 3.0, and 3.1. It does not apply to later versions of Windows.
