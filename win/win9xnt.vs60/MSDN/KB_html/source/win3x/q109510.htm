The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you try to change your virtual memory configuration using the Enhanced
button in Control Panel, you may receive one of the following error
messages:
<P>
<PRE>   32-bit File Access is not running because you started a real-mode
   network redirector before starting Windows.

</PRE>-or-
<P>
<PRE>   32-bit File Access was unable to run. This may be because you started
   the network before starting Windows, because Windows could not find the
   IFSHLP.SYS driver, or your hard disk(s) may be incompatible with 32-bit
   File Access.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This error can occur when:

<UL><LI>Windows for Workgroups 3.11 32-bit file access (VCACHE) is enabled but
   the IFSHLP.SYS driver is not loading properly (or at all) from the
   CONFIG.SYS file. IFSHLP.SYS must be loaded in order for 32-bit file
   access to function.

<LI>You are using Windows for Workgroups without network functionality, no
   network card is installed, and you have an IDE hard disk. To work around
   this problem remove POWER.EXE.

<LI>If the VSHARE.386 line in the SYSTEM.INI file is missing or not enabled.
   Verify that the following line exists in the [386ENH] section of the
   SYSTEM.INI file:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Device=VSHARE.386
</PRE>
<LI>If you enable 32-bit File Access and do not exit and restart Windows and
</UL>then choose the Virtual Memory button again in the same Windows session.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Make sure that IFSHLP.SYS is being loaded from the CONFIG.SYS file. For
example, if your Windows directory is called WINDOWS and is located on
drive C, CONFIG.SYS should contain the following line:
<P>
<PRE>   device=c:\windows\ifshlp.sys

</PRE>If the IFSHLP.SYS driver is already being loaded from the CONFIG.SYS file,
verify that it is being loaded into memory with the MEM /C /P command.
IFSHLP should take up approximately 4 kilobytes of memory.
<P>
NOTE: If you are using Multi-Config commands in your CONFIG.SYS file, add
the above device statement to the [COMMON] section of your CONFIG.SYS file.
