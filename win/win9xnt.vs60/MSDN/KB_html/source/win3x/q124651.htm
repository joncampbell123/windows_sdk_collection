The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you try to log on to a Microsoft Windows NT or Microsoft LAN Manager
domain through Windows for Workgroups, the following error message may
appear:
<P>
<PRE>   No domain server was available to validate your password. You were
   logged on without password validation.

</PRE>Even though you receive this error, you may still be able to gain access to
Windows NT and LAN Manager resources.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
There are a variety of reasons for receiving the above error (such as
incompatible protocols being used, improper configuration of the domain
name under Windows for Workgroups, and so forth). Some of these causes do
not result in the inability to connect to Windows NT and LAN Manager
resources.
<P>
If you have the appropriate permissions through your user ID and password
combination and the server is online and accessible, you can continue to
use Windows for Workgroups and connect to LAN Manager and Windows NT
resources, even after receiving this error. That is, your access to Windows
NT and LAN Manager servers is based on the access rights assigned to your
user ID and password combination at the server being accessed, not by the
success or failure of your initial logon.
<P>
For additional information about logon validation and reasons for the above
error, search for the following key words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base.
