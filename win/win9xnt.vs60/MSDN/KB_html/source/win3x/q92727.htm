The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article discusses incompatibilities between Norton Utilities and
Windows 3.1.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Disk Monitor</h3>
 
<P>
Norton Utilities Disk Monitor can cause problems with SMARTDrive if
you are running Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1.
Turning off write-behind caching or removing Disk Monitor corrects
these problems. If you try to write to the protected drive, you
encounter an error and your system fails. If you want to write to and
cache a protected drive, add the drive letter to the SMARTDRV command
line in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file. For example, if drive D is protected
by Disk Monitor, add the following line to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file:
<P>
<PRE>   SMARTDRV D

</PRE><h3>NUCONFIG</h3>
 
<P>
The program NUCONFIG.EXE that comes with Norton Utilities versions 6.x
doesn't run correctly with Windows 3.1. This program configures
NCACHE.EXE, which should not be used with Windows 3.1. You should use
SMARTDRV.EXE or another cache that is Windows compatible.
<P>
NUCONFIG may appear to stop responding (hang) when run with Windows
3.1. In most cases, if you wait long enough, the program does return.
This application may also cause a system integrity violation error.
<P>
<P><h3>Norton Command Center</h3>
 
<P>
The Norton Command Center (NCC) in Norton Utilities version 4.5
doesn't correctly reset the display if you are using 40-column mode.
To work around this problem, issue the command again, or upgrade to
Norton version 5.0 or later.
<P>
<P><h3>TIMEMARK</h3>
 
<P>
Norton TIMEMARK cannot keep track of time that has passed between the
use of the Start parameter in one command prompt and the use of the
Stop parameter in another command prompt in Windows 3.1 standard mode.
<P>
<P><h3>NCACHE</h3>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Norton Utilities Version 5.0 (DISKREET, NCACHE)</h3>
 
<P>
This program is incompatible with Windows 3.1 and may cause your
system to fail. It is recommended that you upgrade to the most recent
version of Norton Utilities to correct such problems.
<P>
<P><h3>Norton Utilities Version 6.01 (NCACHE)</h3>
 
<P>
Some versions of NCACHE may prevent you from setting up or starting
Windows 3.1. When Windows is running in standard mode, your system may
fail, especially if NCACHE is set up as an EMS cache. Setting up
NCACHE as an EMS cache is not recommended. Setting up NCACHE as an XMS
cache may correct this problem.
<P>
You may also encounter additional problems using NCACHE. New versions
may correct these problems. For an updated version of NCACHE, contact
Symantec Corporation. In the meantime, you can use SMARTDrive, which
is provided with Windows 3.1.
<P>
<P><h3>Norton Utilities Version 6.01 (DISKMON)</h3>
 
<P>
The text below discusses information from the Symantec application
note #4103 about Norton Utilities version 6.01 and Microsoft Windows
operating system version 3.1.

<OL><P><LI>NCACHE, the Norton disk caching software, may cause system lockups
   when Windows 3.1 is run in standard mode. Norton recommends
   configuring NCACHE for extended memory. If the problem continues,
   disable the Write cache. Consult your Norton manual for instructions.

<P><LI>NCACHE is incompatible with Windows 3.1 32-bit Disk Access. If
   using 32-bit Disk Access, then use SMARTDRV.EXE version 4.0.

<P><LI>The following error message will occur if you run Norton's
   Calibrate utility while SMARTDRV.EXE is caching the drive:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Disk Mapping Error
</PRE><P>
   Disable SMARTDRV.EXE when using the Calibrate program.

<P><LI>Microsoft recommends not running Norton Disk Monitor, DISKMON.EXE,
   while Windows is running. It may cause a prolonged beeping noise.

<P><LI>Erase Protect is normally configured to use as much free hard drive
   space as necessary, this sometimes causes Windows to experience
   printing and temporary swap file problems, because of lack of space
   for temporary files. Norton recommends configuring Erase Protect not
   to protect files with the extensions of .TMP and .SWP, and limiting
   the size of the of Erase Protect to 2048. Consult your Norton manual
   for instructions.
<P>
</OL><h3>Norton Shell</h3>
 
<P>
The Norton Shell should not be used to start Windows 3.1. Microsoft
recommends starting Windows operating system version 3.1 from the
command prompt or the AUTOEXEC.BAT file.
