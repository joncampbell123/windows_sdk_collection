The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.1, 3.11

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If you use the Logitech Mouse with the Microsoft Windows operating
system version 3.1, you may experience problems using the mouse in an
MS-DOS window if you start the MS-DOS application with a program
information file (PIF).
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
With Windows 3.1, you can use the mouse in an MS-DOS application that
is being run in a window if you have an MS-DOS-based mouse driver and
a Windows mouse driver that support this functionality. The
MS-DOS-based mouse driver must be able to communicate with Windows
mouse driver for this to work correctly. The Microsoft mouse driver
version 8.2 or later and the Logitech mouse driver version 6.02 or
later support this feature.
<P>
If you are using the Logitech MS-DOS mouse driver and you start an
MS-DOS application in a window using a PIF, the mouse does not work.
You must start the application full screen and then move it into a
window by pressing ALT+ENTER.
<P>
Logitech is aware of this problem and is working on an update to their
mouse driver.
<P>
Note: Running an MS-DOS application in a window is a feature of 386
enhanced mode only.
<P>
The Logitech Mouse is manufactured by Logitech, Inc., vendor
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise,
regarding this product's performance or reliability.
