The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When the NET START command is executed, you receive one or more of the
following error messages
<P>
<PRE>   Failure: PROTOCOL.INI does not have a DRIVERNAME=xxx.

   Failure: Protocol Manager did not accept xxx.

   Failure: NDIS environment invalid. Driver not loaded.

   Error loading device driver xxx.

   Error 7306: The driver failed to initialize.

   xxx was not loaded.

   Error 7321: Network card drivers failed to load.

</PRE>where "xxx" is your network card driver name (for example, EXP16 or
EXP16.DOS).
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
If you install a second network interface card (NIC) of the same brand and
model as the original and then load an NDIS 2 (real-mode) driver and
protocol for this card, you encounter problems if the initial adapter is
using an NDIS 3 (protected-mode) driver and protocol.
<P>
Because an NDIS 2 driver must run in real mode, it is initialized before
Windows for Workgroups 3.11 is loaded. The adapter binding with the NDIS 2
driver becomes the first physical adapter. To complete the binding process,
the NDIS 2 driver looks in the PROTOCOL.INI file for a
DriverName=FirstDriverInstance$ setting. Because an NDIS 3 driver was
installed first, no such setting exists since NDIS 3 drivers do not require
this setting.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To avoid the above error messages, perform the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Choose the Network Setup icon in the Network group.

<P><LI>Choose the Drivers button.

<P><LI>Remove both network card drivers.

<P><LI>Choose Close, then choose OK. (Allow Windows to reboot the computer
    when you are prompted to do so.)

<P><LI>Restart Windows.

<P><LI>Choose the Network Setup icon in the Network group.

<P><LI>Choose the Drivers button.

<P><LI>Add the network card driver for your network card.

<P><LI>Set up this card with the NDIS 2 driver and protocol.

<P><LI>Add the second instance of the network card driver for your
    network card.

<P><LI>Set up this card with the NDIS 3 driver and protocol.

<P><LI>Choose Close, then choose OK. (Allow Windows to reboot the computer
    when you are prompted to do so.)
<P></OL>
