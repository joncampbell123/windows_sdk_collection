The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you upgrade to Windows version 3.1 on a system with Windows 3.0 that
has more than 40 program groups, the following error message occurs when
Setup attempts to create the program groups:
<P>
<PRE>   Progman.exe caused a General Protection Fault in Progman.exe.

</PRE>Choosing Ignore allows Setup to continue, but the same error message
occurs each time Windows 3.1 is started.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Windows 3.0 has no limit on the number of program groups that can be
created in Program Manager; however, Windows 3.1 is limited to 40 groups.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To solve this problem, edit the PROGMAN.INI file and reduce the number
of groups that are loading to fewer than 40 groups.
<P>
This can be accomplished as follows:

<OL><P><LI>Open PROGMAN.INI in Notepad to edit the PROGMAN.INI file.

<P><LI>Locate the [Groups] section.

<P><LI>After the [Groups] section, you will see lines beginning with the word
   "GroupX," where X is the group number. For example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Group1=c:\Windows\main.grp
</PRE>
<P><LI>Remove the extra GroupX= lines by placing a semicolon (;)
   at the beginning of the extra lines until you have no more than 40
   groups. For example, let's say you have groups called Example and
   Example2, and you don't use these groups very often. Remove them
   from you list of active groups by adding a semicolon as follows:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ;Group40=c:\Windows\example.grp
      ;Group41=c:\Windows\example2.grp
</PRE>
<P><LI>Save the file and start Windows as usual.
<P>
</OL>For more information about Program Manager's restrictions on the
number of program groups or items, query on the following words in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
