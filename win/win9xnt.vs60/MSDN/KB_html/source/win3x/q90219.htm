<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Some object-linking-and-embedding (OLE) applications provide menu
entries and shortcut key combinations to edit linked objects. When you
link an object using information from another computer's ClipBook,
these options are not available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
There are two basic types of OLE objects: linked objects and embedded
objects. Both of these are supported by ClipBook Viewer.
<P>
All information that describes an embedded object is held in the
ClipBook page, and can be inserted in a document on another computer.
If the application used to create the information is available on the
other computer, the object can be edited as well.
<P>
When an object is linked, the information remains on the computer
where it was created. Links to the object in documents on other
computers receive updates of the information from the originating
computer.
<P>
Most OLE applications provide the ability to edit an object that has
been linked (not embedded) into another document. This operation is
not possible when the linked object is from another computer. The OLE
process depends on access to the original source file, which in this
case resides on another computer.
<P>
While the original source file can be made available to others through
file sharing, creating a DDE share does not give others the ability to
edit your source document.
<P>
Depending on the applications involved and the security setting,
attempting to edit an object linked from another computer may change
the appearance of the server application (preparing it for editing),
or report an error.
