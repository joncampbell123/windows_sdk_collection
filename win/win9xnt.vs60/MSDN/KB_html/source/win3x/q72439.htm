The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
This article discusses an undocumented and unsupported command line
parameter. Microsoft does not support or encourage the use of this
parameter, but provides this article as information only. Use this
parameter at your own risk.
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Recorder application (RECORDER.EXE) that is included with Windows 3.0
and 3.1 can be started with certain command-line parameters that allow
Recorder to load a file when started and, optionally, automatically run a
macro that is defined in the file.

<OL><P><LI>From the Program Manager, click the Recorder icon.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Properties.

<P><LI>Specify the optional parameters in the Command Line box.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To start Recorder and load a file, the command line syntax is
<P>
<PRE>   RECORDER.EXE &lt;filename&gt;

</PRE></OL>where &lt;filename&gt; is the name of the Recorder file you want to load. If
the file is not in the same directory as Recorder, then the path needs
to be specified before the filename.
<P>
The following starts Recorder and loads the file TEST.REC:
<P>
<PRE>   RECORDER.EXE TEST.REC

</PRE><h3>Auto-Executing Macros</h3>
 
<P>
Optionally, you can have Recorder automatically execute a macro that
is defined in the macro file. The syntax of the line that does this is
<P>
<PRE>    RECORDER.EXE -h &lt;shortcutkey&gt; &lt;filename&gt;

</PRE>where &lt;filename&gt; is the Recorder filename you want to load and
&lt;shortcutkey&gt; is the key defined in the macro that is being loaded.
The -h switch tells Recorder to use the hotkey defined immediately
after the -h.
<P>
For example, if a macro is defined in the macro file TEST.REC that
used the shortcut key ALT+F10, the command line to execute this macro
when starting Recorder is
<P>
<PRE>   RECORDER.EXE -h %F10 TEST.REC

</PRE>Note the % in this example. This signifies the ALT key. The following
table explains the key sequences:
<P>
<PRE>    Key             Sequence
    ---             --------

    ALT                %
    CTRL               ^
    SHIFT              +

</PRE>It is possible to use all these keys in conjunction with the keys
listed in the drop-down list box in the dialog box that appears when
you choose Properties from the Macro menu. A sample command line is as
follows:
<P>
<PRE>   RECORDER.EXE -h %^+F10 TEST.REC

</PRE>Depending on your version of Windows, there are up to three ways to
automatically run macros when you start Windows.

<UL><LI>To start Recorder from the MS-DOS prompt when you start Windows and
   have it execute a macro, use the following command line during startup:
<P>
<P><PRE>      WIN RECORDER.EXE -h %^+F10 TEST.REC
</PRE><P>
   NOTE:  If you are entering this command line into a batch file, you
   need to use a double percent sign, %%. A single percent sign
   is interpreted as a null character and does not perform the
   desired function.
<P>
</UL>-or-

<UL><LI>Run the macros from the RUN= or LOAD= line in the WIN.INI file (for
   example, enter "RUN=mymacro.rec" in the WIN.INI file [without the
   quotation marks]).
<P>
</UL>-or-

<UL><LI>In Windows 3.0, Use the following steps to automatically execute your
   Windows Recorder macro without having to include the command line
   parameters:
<P>
   a. From File Manager, highlight a Recorder macro document file.
<P>
   b. From the File menu, choose Associate.
<P>
   c. Type "recorder.exe -h &lt;shortcutkey&gt;" (without the quotation
<P><PRE>      marks), where &lt;shortcutkey&gt; is the hotkey for your macro.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      For example, if a macro was defined in the macro file
      MYMACRO.REC that used the shortcut key ALT+F12, type the
      following in the Associate dialog box:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>         recorder.exe -h %f12

      NOTE: Using CTRL+Shortcutkey does not work in this situation.
      The symbol for CTRL "^" is reserved in the [EXTENSIONS] section
      of WIN.INI. Using CTRL in the hotkey causes the following
      message:

         No macro file - ignoring shortcut key MACRONAME.REC

   d. Place the name of the macro file on the LOAD= or RUN= line of the
      WIN.INI file.

      -or-

      Start Windows from MS-DOS, specifying the macro filename (for
      example, type "win mymacro.rec" [without the quotation marks]).

</PRE></UL>Note that all macro files run from any command line, including File
Manager and the MS-DOS Executive, execute files automatically using
the specified shortcut key.
