</UL><h3>Changes and New Features</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft Windows for Workgroups (WFW) version 3.11 contains all of the
features included in version 3.1 plus the following features:
<P>
Network Features:

<UL><LI>NDIS 3.0-specification network drivers: Protect-mode drivers, installed
   as VXDs, using no conventional memory.
<LI>NWLink (and NWNBLink): 32-bit protect-mode protocol for the IPX/SPX
   transport. Routable. NWNBLink adds a NetBIOS layer.
<LI>Novell NetWare ODI connectivity. Full support for IPXODI, monolithic
   IPX, and MSIPX (from WFW 3.1).
<LI>Universal Client Support. Can be configured using Windows network
   drivers to be a client only for all of the networks supported with
   Windows 3.1.
<LI>ADMINCFG: A utility for network administrators. Configures security and
   WFW 3.11 network settings for individual WFW 3.11 workstations remotely.
   Documented primarily in the Windows Resource Kit. Allows the disabling
   of file sharing, print sharing, and network DDE sharing.
<LI>Remote Access Service (RAS). Client software for dialing into a RAS
   server on a Windows NT or LAN Manager server. A Point-to-Point server
   for WFW computers was made available via download later. When a client
   dials into a Windows NT or LAN Manager RAS server, he or she has full
   connectivity into the network. If a client dials into the WFW Point-to-
   Point RAS server, he or she has connectivity to that computer only.
<LI>Real Mode Server for Workgroup Add-On for MS-DOS. Allows 8088/8086-based
   computers (and higher) to share their resources (usually as print
   servers). NOTE: The real-mode server is available only in Workgroup Add-
   On for MS-DOS.
<P>
</UL>Non-Network Features:

<UL><LI>No Network option. WFW can be installed with no network support, much
   like Windows 3.1. Also, WFW 3.11 can be invoked without network
   components (with the WIN /N command) even though installed for a
   network.
<LI>Performance Enhancements (VFAT and VCACHE). WFW 3.11 includes VFAT, a
   32-bit file system that processes INT21h calls for file I/O on local
   disk volumes in protect mode. WFW 3.11 also includes a unified protect-
   mode cache, VCACHE, for both network files accessed by the network
   redirector and local files accessed through VFAT.
<LI>Microsoft At Work PC-Fax. Allows workstations to share fax modems to
   send and receive fax messages using the Microsoft Mail MAPI engine.
<LI>Enhanced Communication Architecture. The architecture of the
   communications interface is more modular. Its components are COMM.DRV,
   *VCD, VCOMM.386, SERIAL.386, and LPT.386. With this new modular design,
   vendors can write device-specific drivers for serial or LPT ports to
   interface with VCOMM.386. It uses the 32-bit interface directly with
   VCOMM.386.
<LI>New troubleshooting switches: WIN /D:C turns off 32-bit file access.
   WIN /D:T skips the *.386 drivers in the [386Enh] section of the
   SYSTEM.INI file.
<P>
</UL><h3>Available Packages (SKUs)</h3>
 

<UL><LI>Windows for Workgroups 3.11--full retail version (also used to upgrade
   over Windows 2.x and 3.0).
<LI>Workgroup Add-On for Microsoft Windows--upgrade over Windows 3.1 or WFW
   3.1 only.
<LI>Workgroup Add-On for MS-DOS--full retail version (also used to upgrade
   over Workgroup Connection 1.0).
<P>
</UL><h3>Limitations</h3>
 

<UL><LI>Real-mode server capabilities available only in Workgroup Add-On for
   MS-DOS, not in WFW 3.11.
<LI>VCACHE caches only local and network hard disks (no CD-ROM or floppy
   drives).
<LI>Standard mode not supported.
