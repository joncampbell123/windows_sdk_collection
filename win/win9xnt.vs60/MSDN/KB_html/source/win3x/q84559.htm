The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Hewlett-Packard (HP) provides a scalable printer driver for use with
the DeskJet 500 and DeskJet 500C printers and Microsoft Windows
version 3.0. This driver is not updated during the upgrade from
Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.0 to version 3.1.
<P>
This HP printer driver is not compatible with the TrueType font
technology that is included with Microsoft Windows operating system
version 3.1. However, the HP driver does include the scalable fonts CG
Times, Courier, and Univers. These fonts are not available if the
Microsoft supplied driver that is included with Microsoft Windows
version 3.1 is used.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When upgrading from the Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.0
to version 3.1, the HP DeskJet 500 scalable font printer driver is not
updated. The earlier driver is left installed because the Microsoft
provided DeskJet 500 printer driver does not directly support some of
the HP scalable soft fonts included with the earlier printer driver.
<P>
The DeskJet printer driver included with Windows 3.1 supports TrueType
fonts, unlike the HP version. The new driver supplied with Microsoft
Windows 3.1 has compatible fonts to the HP scalable fonts.
<P>
TrueType fonts will not be available to Windows applications if the HP
supplied scalable driver is used.
<P>
The Microsoft supplied driver includes the following TrueType fonts that
are compatible with the HP scalable fonts.
<P>
<PRE>Hewlett-Packard Scalable Font   Microsoft TrueType Scalable Font
-----------------------------   --------------------------------

CG Times                        Times New Roman
Courier                         Courier New
Univers                         Arial

</PRE>Do the following to add the new Microsoft Windows 3.1 DeskJet 500
printer driver:

<OL><P><LI>Run Control Panel.

<P><LI>Choose the Printers icon.

<P><LI>Choose Add.

<P><LI>Choose the appropriate driver (DeskJet 500, or DeskJet 500C).

<P><LI>Choose Install.
<P>
</OL>After installing the new DeskJet 500 printer driver, the HP Scalable
driver may be left installed in conjunction with the current driver,
or may be removed.
<P>
Most Windows-based applications allow switching between printer
drivers from the File menu. Often this selection is available as Print
Setup or Printer Setup. This feature allows you to switch between the
earlier HP scalable driver and the later Microsoft driver that
supports TrueType. This feature will only be available if both drivers
are installed.
<P>
While the HP scalable driver may be left in tact for compatibility
reasons, the newer TrueType driver provides compatible fonts and
should be suited for most applications. For most users, the HP
scalable driver can be removed.
<P>
<P><h3>Notes</h3>
 
<P>
Saved documents that include CG Times, Courier, and Univers fonts will
be automatically updated to use the TrueType counterparts when the
Microsoft 3.1 driver is installed.
