<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The hDC Memory Viewer is a utility included as part of the Windows
Resource Kit. This utility gives you a graphic display of how your
system's memory (including extended and expanded memory) is being
used. It also uses an icon to display the amount of free memory you
have available. The following is a description of how Memory Viewer
reports the memory usage under Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The amount of memory use being reported in the DOS area includes the
memory used by any TSR (terminate-and-stay-resident) programs and
drivers, including SMARTDrive or RAMDrive.
<P>
When the Include Discardables check box is selected in the Options
File menu in the hDC Memory Viewer, it will display the sum amount of
memory including code segments that Windows has marked as
"discardable." Not all the code segments that an application requires
are needed at any given moment. When these unused code segments are
marked as discardable, Windows can use that area of memory for another
applications. However, it must always save enough memory space so that
all the applications that are loaded can perform any potential
functions that they might call. This is where the "Swap Area" listed
on the Memory Viewer comes in; this is a common "ensure area" that
Windows uses to ensure that all applications have the potential memory
that they may need.
<P>
Most Windows-based applications have a large portion of their code
segment marked as discardable; however, not all Window's-based applications
do this.
<P>
The Memory Viewer has the option to display memory used by
applications, system libraries, system fonts, and device drivers. The
memory reported in use by system libraries (User, GDI, and so on) is
an indication of how much system resources are being used, but it
requires some interpretation. The amount reported for each library
includes the data segment, any code segments, and any objects on the
local heap "owned" by that library. Any one of these items can be up
to 64K (thus the 64K limitation on system resources in Windows 3.0).
When combined, however, they could be a lot more -- this is why each
of the libraries can total 100K or more.
