<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The following information was taken from the WinLogin 1.0 CLIENT.WRI
file.
<P>
This information applies to version 1.0 of Microsoft WinLogin. For
information about ordering Microsoft WinLogin, call the Microsoft Sales
Information Center (MSIC) at (800) 426-9400, or mail the form supplied with
the Windows Resource Kit (WRK) for the Microsoft Windows operating system
version 3.1.

<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>WinLogin Workstations</h3>
 
<P>
This document contains information about using WinLogin, for end
users. If you are looking for additional information about Windows
version 3.1 that does not pertain to networks, see "Other Online
Documents" at the end of this file for a description of the Windows
3.1 online documents.
<P>
Other Online Documents
<P>
The following table describes other online documents that contain
important information about WinLogin that is not included in the
Microsoft WinLogin User's Guide or in online Help:
<P>
<PRE>Document     Contains

README.WRI   Information about using WinLogin with a specific version
             of your network, and information updated after the
             administrator's guide was printed.

ADMIN.WRI    Detailed technical information about how WinLogin works.

</PRE>**********************************************************************
<P>
This document is designed for the system administrator's use as an aid
in the preparation of a document for distribution to WinLogin clients.
It should be used as a template and modified for the specific
installation of WinLogin.
<P>
WinLogin, a tool that allows central configuration of Windows 3.1
workstations on a network, has been installed on this machine. This
program allows .INI files to be created as Windows boots. Windows will
use these newly created .INI files rather than the original .INI files
that were created by Windows setup. Windows will look and act exactly
as it did before WinLogin was installed, with only a few exceptions.
<P>
<P><h3>Changes to your Windows Setup</h3>
 
<P>
When WinLogin was setup, the Windows version 3.1 WIN.COM file was
renamed W31.COM and the WLCOM.COM file was copied to the workstation
and renamed WIN.COM.
<P>
A FALLBACK subdirectory is created in the Windows directory on the
workstation. Critical .INI files that were on the workstation when
WinLogin was set up are copied to the FALLBACK directory. These files
can be used to start Windows if there are problems with the network,
or if there are problems in using the user, workstation, group, or
default settings. (WinLogin also maintains another set of backup files
in the Windows directory. The .INI files for the last user who logged
on are renamed with the .LGN extension and saved in the Windows
directory.) These files must not be deleted.
<P>
<P><h3>Starting Windows using WinLogin</h3>
 
<P>
You will still start Windows by typing "WIN". WinLogin checks the
database for the location of the various configuration files it needs
and builds the appropriate files by using the administrative settings
and the settings for the user, workstation, and group that your system
administrator has defined. You will notice a small dialog box appear
in the upper left hand corner telling you which file WinLogin is
building.
<P>
You can also use the /u option to specify your name when you start
Windows using WinLogin. If you were the last user logged on to this
machine, the user backup files are used to start Windows. This
decreases the time needed to start Windows because WinLogin does not
have to build the configuration files--instead, it uses the backup
.INI files stored in the Windows directory on the workstation.
<P>
To start Windows by using the /u option, at the MS-DOS prompt, type
win /u:username, where username is your name.
<P>
If the name does not match the last user's name, WinLogin follows the
usual procedure for building the configuration files for you and the
workstation that you are using.
<P>
<P><h3>Running Windows with WinLogin</h3>
 
<P>
Windows looks the same as it did before WinLogin was setup on the
workstation, except that when WinLogin is running on a workstation,
the WinLogin icon appears on the desktop. You can use this application
to save the current configuration settings to the directories on the
server. To save the current settings to the files on the network, from
the Configuration menu, choose Save.
<P>
Every few seconds, WinLogin will check for logon status. If someone
was logged on to the network, but now is not, WinLogin will display a
dialog box asking whether the current user wants to continue with the
current configuration or quit Windows and return to MS-DOS. If someone
was logged on to the network and now someone else is logged on,
WinLogin will display a dialog box asking whether the user wants to
continue with the current configuration or restart Windows with
configuration files built for the current user. If no one was logged
on to the network and now someone is, WinLogin will display a dialog
box asking whether the user wants to continue with the current
configuration or restart Windows with configuration files built for
the current user.
<P>
In all of these cases, if you choose to continue with a configuration
that was not built for you, the Save command is not available and the
settings are not saved to the network server when you quit Windows.
<P>
You can quit WinLogin by choosing Exit from the Configuration menu. If
any changes have been made since Windows was started, a dialog box
appears, asking whether to save the current configuration settings to
the files on the network server. After you quit WinLogin, any
configuration changes you make to Windows are not saved.
<P>
<P><h3>Special Modifications to your Windows configuration</h3>
 
<P>
There may be other changes that your system administrator made to your
Windows environment. This has been done either to ensure that all
hardware settings remain with the workstation that WinLogin was
installed on, or to prevent certain changes from being made. Your
system administrator has defined which changes can and cannot be made
to your Windows environment. If you are attempting to make changes to
Windows, such as changing your desktop, colors, or install or modify
an application that makes changes to your Windows configuration files
and these changes are not saved between sessions, check with your
system administrator to determine if you have been prevented from
making these changes.
