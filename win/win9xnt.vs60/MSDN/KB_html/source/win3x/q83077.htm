<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article discusses troubleshooting unsuccessful installations of
the Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1 by examining the
BOOTLOG.TXT file.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When Windows SETUP.EXE completes the character or text portion of
Setup, and the system appears to hang, consider the following:

<OL><P><LI>Wait from 30 to 60 seconds to ensure Windows has not hung. Windows
   may take up to 1 minute to switch from the text mode to the
   graphics mode of Setup.

<P><LI>If the screen still shows the character mode message, the problem
   occurred before the Windows display driver initialized.
<P>
   If the system is hung, restart your system and examine the
   BOOTLOG.TXT file by typing the following at the MS-DOS command
   prompt:
<P>
<PRE>        type BOOTLOG.TXT | more

   If the BOOTLOG.TXT shows that the display driver or some other
   driver is not finished initializing, rerun Setup and select Custom
   Setup to explicitly select drivers. Also, select no network and no
   mouse (and reboot the machine without network software) to
   eliminate these possibilities. Make sure the display selected is
   valid.

</PRE><P><LI>If the screen becomes light gray when the hourglass appears, the
   display driver has finished initializing. Check BOOTLOG.TXT for
   other devices that have not initialized.

<P><LI>If the screen looks like the graphical portion of Setup has
   started, the user name and company screen is displayed. Check to
   ensure the correct keyboard is selected. Also, check to see if the
   reboot message appears when CTRL+ALT+DEL is pressed. If the screen
   displays "garbage" characters, an incorrect display driver is
   probably causing the problem, although this behavior may also be
   caused by hardware/software that is incompatible with DOSX.EXE, or
   another selected driver. Check BOOTLOG.TXT.

<P><LI>If BOOTLOG.TXT is missing, then most likely there is a problem with
   access to extended memory, or there is some software loading that
   does not work when protected mode is initiated.

<P><LI>If BOOTLOG.TXT exists, then the last thing listed should indicate
   the problem area. If BOOTLOG.TXT looks fine, then the problem could
   be a corrupt SETUP.EXE or SETUP.INF.
