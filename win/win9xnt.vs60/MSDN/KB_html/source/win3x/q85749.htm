The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Page 269 of the "Microsoft Windows Resource Kit" (WRK) guide for
Windows 3.1 gives inaccurate instructions for placing the 386 enhanced
mode translation buffers in the upper memory area (UMA).
<P>
Paragraph 3 of the section titled "Freeing Conventional Memory in 386
Enhanced Mode" states:
<P>
<PRE>   Then add an x= switch to the EMM386 line in the CONFIG.SYS to
   exclude the unused UMB ranges.

</PRE>Other information in this section indicates that Windows 3.1  uses
these excluded ranges for placement of the translation buffers.
<P>
This is incorrect; any UMAs excluded by an upper memory block (UMB)
provider will also be excluded from use by Windows 3.1.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Windows running in 386 enhanced mode queries any UMB provider (such as
EMM386.EXE, QEMM, and 386Max) for information about the UMB area.
<P>
Every UMB provider creates a data structure that contains the following
information in 4K granularity (that is, every 4K is marked as one of the
following):

<OL><P><LI>Part of a UMB
   Something has been loaded into this address range.

<P><LI>Part of an EMM page frame
   The memory is part of a LIM 4.0 page frame.

<P><LI>Part of an EMS page frame
   The memory is part of a LIM 3.2 page frame.

<P><LI>Usable
   This is the region that is "free." All areas marked by an I=
   parameter in EMM386.EXE, which are not actually used, will be
   marked as usable.

<P><LI>Unusable
   This is the region that is either RAM, ROM, or specifically
   excluded (for example, the X= parameter in EMM386.EXE).

<P><LI>Unknown
   All addresses that are not scanned will be marked as Unknown.
   This region will be scanned by Windows as it normally would.
<P>
</OL>Under Microsoft Windows 3.0, only numbers 1 and 3 are looked at.
Consequently, address ranges that need to be excluded on the command
line for the UMB provider should also be excluded in the [386Enh]
section of the SYSTEM.INI with an EMMExclude statement.
<P>
Under Microsoft Windows 3.1, the whole structure is looked at and assumed
to be valid. As a result, the following entries in the [386Enh] section of
the SYSTEM.INI are ignored, except where they do not conflict with the
structure created by the UMB provider:

<OL><P><LI>EMMINCLUDE

<P><LI>EMMEXCLUDE

<P><LI>RESERVEDHIGHAREA

<P><LI>USEABLEHIGHAREA

<P><LI>IGNOREINSTALLEDEMM

<P><LI>NOEMMDRIVER

<P><LI>EMMPAGEFRAME
<P>
</OL>For example, if EMM386.EXE is installed with the line
<P>
<PRE>   DEVICE=C:\Windows\EMM386.EXE NOEMS

</PRE></OL>then the line "EMMInclude=B000-B7FF" would be used by Windows 3.1
because the B000 region is not scanned by EMM386.EXE. However, the
line "EMMExclude=D800-DFFF" will be ignored because this region is
scanned by EMM386.EXE.
