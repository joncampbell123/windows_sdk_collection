The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If the same computer is operating as both the postoffice server and
the browse master for a workgroup, the system may appear to stop
responding (hang) when Workgroup Mail is active.
<P>
You may have to wait for as long as three to four minutes for the
system to return to your control.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Windows for Workgroups dynamically elects a computer in a workgroup to
act as the browse master for a period of time. If this computer
happens to be the same computer that is acting as the postoffice
server, performance may drop significantly when Mail is active.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
If your computer is acting as the postoffice server and you are
experiencing severe performance problems, add the following line to
the [Network] section of the SYSTEM.INI file:
<P>
<PRE>   MaintainServerList=no

</PRE>This setting prevents your computer from ever becoming the browse
master. Note that this setting should only be used in extreme cases.
