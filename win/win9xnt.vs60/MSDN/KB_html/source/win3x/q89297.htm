The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
The following article contains information on the use of Windows for
Workgroups with third-party products or configurations that have not
been tested and are not supported by Microsoft.
<P>
If the steps or procedures described in this article do not function
properly, contact the manufacturer of the third-party product for more
information or use a supported configuration.
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you use Windows for Workgroups and don't have a network card
installed or if the network card and driver fail to initialize, you receive
one of the following error messages:
<P>
<PRE>   The Following Error Occurred While loading the device VNETSUP:
   Could not locate driver WORKGRP.SYS (DOS error 2).

   -or-

   The following error ocurred while loading the device VNETSUP:
   Error 6111: Could not locate driver WORKGRP.SYS (MS-DOS error 2)

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The error message appears because WORKGRP.SYS or the NDIS driver
(.DOS) is unable to load in the CONFIG.SYS file.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To disable the error and allow Windows for Workgroups to function as a
standalone installation of Windows 3.1, comment out the network.drv=
entry in the SYSTEM.INI file (that is, place a semicolon in front of
the network.drv= line).
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
You may occasionally need to use Windows for Workgroups without a
network card (for example, card failure, card repair). By removing
WFWNET.DRV from the network.drv= line in the [BOOT] section of the
SYSTEM.INI file, the error message will no longer appear and Windows
3.1 functionality will remain. Change the following line in the [BOOT]
section
<P>
<PRE>   network.drv=wfwnet.drv

</PRE>-to-
<P>
<PRE>   ;network.drv=wfwnet.drv

</PRE>then add the following line below it:
<P>
<PRE>   network.drv=

</PRE>This change disables the Windows for Workgroups network driver from
loading.
