<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you are running Microsoft Windows in enhanced mode and you attempt to
scan a document with the Complete Scanner, you can't see the image on the
screen.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
According to Complete technical support, the Complete Scanner does not
work properly with Windows 3.0 in enhanced mode when the scanner is
connected through a scanner port on the Complete Fax Card.
<P>
NOTE: This applies only when the scanner is connected through a scanner
port on the Complete Fax Card.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
According to Complete technical support, you can work around this problem
by adding the following line to the [386Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI
file:
<P>
<PRE>   COMXIRQ=false

</PRE>where X equals the COM port to which the card is assigned)
<P>
This disables the modem when Windows runs in enhanced mode and allows the
scanner to work correctly.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Complete Scanner is an MS-DOS application and should work correctly in
real and standard modes, or outside of Windows.
<P>
