The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
You may experience problems when using the Logitech Serial Mouse with
Microsoft Windows version 3.0.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Logitech terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) programs conflict with the
operation and installation of Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
You should remark out the LOGIMENU and CLICK TSR programs if they are
listing in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file. In addition, if you find the
GOMOUSE.BAT file, replace it with a MOUSE.COM file dated 10/02/89
because the GOMOUSE.BAT file may also contain LOGIMENU and CLICK.
<P>
If your mouse continues to exhibit problems, refer to the following
troubleshooting sections to resolve the problem(s).
<P>
<P><h3>Mouse Pointer Doesn't Move or Doesn't Appear</h3>
 
<P>
In addition to problems caused by TSRs, you may notice that the Mouse
pointer intermittently shows up in Windows 3.0 but does not move, or
that the mouse pointer may not display at all.

<OL><P><LI>Verify the Windows Logitech Serial Mouse Driver is installed by
   selecting the Setup icon from the Main group of Program Manager.
   Verify that the mouse driver file is the corect size and date:
   the Windows 3.0 file should be dated 5/1/90 and the 3.00a file
   should be dated 10/31/90; either version should be 3584 bytes in
   size. Files of different sizes or dates may still be compressed,
   or may be corrupted, or may have been provided with an OEM
   version of Windows. Also verify that a Microsoft VGA or EGA
   driver is loaded rather than a Super VGA driver.

<P><LI>If you have one of the following combinations, use TYPE=2 at
   the end of the WIN.INI file:
<P>
<P><PRE>      BUS card and Logitech serial-type mouse (including serial
      Trackman)
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      PS/2-type port and Logitech serial-type mouse (including
      serial Trackman)
</PRE><P>
   Copy the following example to the end of the WIN.INI file:
<P>
<P><PRE>      [MOUSE]
      TYPE=2
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: According to Logitech, TYPE=3 is no longer supported by
   the Windows 3.00 Logitech Serial Mouse driver.

<P><LI>Boot with a minimal CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT.
<P>
   The CONFIG.SYS file should contain FILES=30, BUFFERS=30,
   DEVICE=HIMEM.SYS, and required disk-partitioning drivers.
<P>
   The AUTOEXEC.BAT file should contain PROMPT $P$G and a PATH
   command to DOS, WINDOWS, and the root directory.
<P>
   Reboot the machine with this configuration. When the machine
   reboots, the BIOS and DOS versions may be displayed along with the
   amount of memory. Write these down and verify that the DOS version
   is the correct version for the machine, and verify that the BIOS is
   at least 1988 or later.

<P><LI>Check that no other device is using the same interrupt. If the mouse
   is on COM1, then no other device should be set for Interrupt 4. If
   the mouse is on COM2, then no other device should be set for
   Interrupt 3.

<P><LI>Check the serial card containing COM ports for the Logitech Mouse.
   Look at the card for a square chip. It may read WINBOND with a
   number underneath it resembling W86C452P. If that chip exists,
   it should be replaced with a different serial-card model.
   (If replacing the card is not an option, proceed to Step 6).

<P><LI>If all else fails, re-install the Windows mouse driver for the
   following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Mouse Systems (or VisiOn) connected to COM1
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      -OR-
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      Mouse Systems (or VisiOn) connected to COM2
</PRE><P>
</OL><h3>Problems After Starting MS-DOS Applications</h3>
 
<P>
Another problem you may have with the Logitech Mouse may occur when
starting any MS-DOS application under Windows (including the MS-DOS
prompt). In this case, quitting or switching back to Windows may cause
erratic mouse movement. If the mouse pointer moves slowly, jumps from
point to point on the screen, or moves at different speeds when running
non-Windows applications, you may have a problem with the MS-DOS
mouse-driver file. You can avoid this problem as follows:

<OL><P><LI>Install version 4.10 of the Logitech Mouse Driver for MS-DOS systems
   that is usually located on the second disk of the Logitech MouseWare
   Utilities Disk for version 4.01.
<P>
   Do not confuse the version of the MouseWare Utilities Disk for 4.01
   with the Logitech Mouse DOS Driver for version 4.10.

<P><LI>If Step 6 above was used to resolve Symptom #1, then you may
   have to create a batch file that contains the following two lines:
<P>
<P><PRE>      &lt;appname&gt;.EXE {the name of the DOS application being run}
      MOUSE PC
</PRE><P>
</OL>Follow the steps on Page 448 of the "Microsoft Windows User's Guide"
that explain "Creating PIFs for Batch Files."
