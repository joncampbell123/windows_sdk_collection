</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Windows for Workgroups fully supports NetBIOS-based applications (such as
Lotus Notes). NetBIOS functionality within Windows for Workgroups is
provided by the NDIS NetBEUI protocol or transport.
<P>
Novell NetWare offers NetBIOS support by using a terminate-and-stay-
resident (TSR) program called NETBIOS.EXE. To enable NetBIOS support under
Novell NetWare, NETBIOS.EXE must be loaded.
<P>
NOTE: NETBIOS.EXE is not provided with Windows for Workgroups. If you have
an earlier installation of NetWare on your machine, you should be able to
use the NETBIOS.EXE TSR program available from that installation.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Using the Novell NETBIOS.EXE TSR program with Windows for Workgroups
requires some manual modifications to your AUTOEXEC.BAT and SYSTEM.INI
files. The following steps enable NETBIOS.EXE to support NetBIOS across the
MSIPX transport.
<P>
NOTE: Make sure that NETBEUI is at LANA0. If you have IPX (Novell) at
LANA0, MSD cannot recognize NETBIOS. Moving NETBEUI to LANA0 and IPX to
LANA1 and using NET START NETBEUI enables MSD to recognize NETBIOS.

<OL><P><LI>Install the NetWare support in Windows for Workgroups. You can do this
   in the Network area in Control Panel.

<P><LI>Edit your AUTOEXEC.BAT file and add "C:\NETWARE\NETBIOS.EXE"
   (without the quotation marks) so that it is loaded after all the
   following network commands:
<P>
<PRE>      net start               &lt;-- WFWG command to initialize network
      msipx.com               &lt;-- WFWG NetWare IPX transport
      netx.com /ps=lanlord    &lt;-- WFWG NetWare shell
      login lanlord/jane      &lt;-- WFWG NetWare login to NetWare server

   Make sure that the NETBIOS.EXE TSR program is loaded before you start
   Windows.

</PRE><P><LI>Edit your SYSTEM.INI file in your WINDOWS directory. In the [386Enh]
   section, add the line "V86MODELANAS=0" (without the quotation marks).
   Under the [NETWORK] section add the line "EXCLUDE=0" (without the
   quotation marks).

<P><LI> Restart your machine.
