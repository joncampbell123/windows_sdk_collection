The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a
<LI>Microsoft Windows Productivity Pack version 1.0
</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Windows Productivity Pack version 1.0 creates two program
groups and a total of 10 icons when you install this package under Windows
version 3.0. There are two methods of recovery if you have inadvertently
deleted the application icons and/or program groups. Because the icon
properties for some of the Windows Productivity Pack modules are somewhat
unusual, the normal method of manually setting up Windows icons or using
the Windows Search For Applications feature doesn't work unless you have
additional information about the required command line entries.
<P>
This is because of the method Productivity Pack uses to create its
icons. Each icon refers to an executable file and either a data file
or a Windows Help file. If you choose Set Up Applications from the
Options menu of Windows Setup, you can recover the executable files.
The only way to recover a lost Troubleshooter Tools group and the
associated icons is to reinstall the Productivity Pack.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
One way of recovering the Productivity Pack groups and icons is to run
the Productivity Pack Setup program. This will re-create all the
groups and icons.
<P>
However, if you only deleted a few things, it may be easier to
re-create them manually. Listed below are the contents of each program
group and the correct properties that must be entered to create the
icons that are normally generated by the Setup program.
<P>
<P><h2>PRODUCTIVITY PACK GROUP CONTENTS</h2>
 
<P>
<PRE>Icon Description        Command Line
----------------        ------------

Learning Windows        C:\PRODPACK\LWIN.EXE

Quick Troubleshooter    C:\PRODPACK\QT.EXE LWINHELP.EXE TROUBLES.HLP

Working Smarter         C:\PRODPACK\LWINHELP.EXE SMARTER.HLP

</PRE>Note that the c:\prodpack portion of the paths listed above are
simply the original program defaults. If you installed the Windows
Productivity Pack to a different directory, insert the appropriate
path.

View SYSTEM.INI         NOTEPAD.EXE C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM.INI

File Manager            WINFILE.EXE
PIF Editor              PIFEDIT.EXE

</PRE>Note that the C:\WINDOWS portion of the paths listed above are simply
the original program defaults. If you installed Windows to a directory
other than WINDOWS, insert the appropriate path.
<P>
The name of the group in which these icons reside must be called
"Troubleshooter Tools." You cannot shorten or change the name in any
way because the Quick Troubleshooter is hard coded to look for that
group name.
<P>
You may receive the following messages when you select an icon created
from the Set Up Applications command of Windows Setup:
<P>
<PRE>Icon Name          Description of Problem or Message that Appears
---------          ----------------------------------------------

MS Modified Help   Starts the Windows Help engine, but doesn't
                   load any file.

</PRE>Windows
<PRE>Setup for WPP      Displays the error message "Setup is currently
                   unable to continue. Insert the Setup disk
                   and type setup again. Press ENTER to exit setup."
                   Windows exits to MS-DOS if ENTER is chosen or if
                   the OK button is chosen. The second time you use
                   this icon, an error message appears stating
                   "Application Execution Error: Cannot find file;
                   check to ensure the path and filename are correct."

</PRE>Quick
<PRE>Troublshooter      Displays the error message "ERROR: Troubleshooter
                   has not been set up correctly. Please insert the
                   Setup disk and type setup."

WINCBT             Display the message "Change Disk: Cannot find
                   CBTLIB.DLL, Please insert in drive A:." If you
                   choose Cancel, the message "Application Execution
                   Error: Cannot find file; check to ensure the path
                   and filename are correct" appears on the screen.
