<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Ventura Publisher's installation program doesn't recognize that you have
inserted the requested disk in the drive and continually prompts you to
insert the next disk in the set. In addition, a message similar to the
following may be displayed:
<P>
<PRE>   General Protection Fault in SETUP2.EXE

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Ventura Publisher is not compatible with the SHARE.EXE program.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around the problem, you should make sure that the SHARE program
is not loaded. You should either rename or remove all copies of SHARE from
your hard drive.
<P>
NOTE: You must rename or remove all copies of SHARE.EXE from your hard
drive because certain Windows applications, including Ventura Publisher,
contain pointers to SHARE.EXE in different locations on the hard drive.
Simply moving SHARE.EXE to a different location on your drive may not work.
<P>
To properly set up Ventura Publisher, search the hard disk for all copies
of SHARE.EXE and then rename or delete them. If you have MS-DOS version 5.0
or later, you can use the following command in the root directory of your
hard drive to locate copies of SHARE:
<P>
<PRE>   DIR share.exe /S

</PRE>After you remove or rename each copy of SHARE from your hard drive, run the
Ventura Publisher setup program again.
<P>
