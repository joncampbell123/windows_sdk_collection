The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11
<LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
You receive insufficient memory errors in Windows or Windows for Workgroups
when you try to run an application or perform a task. The specific error
messages vary but are similar to the following:

<UL><LI>Application Execution Error
   Insufficient memory to run this application. Quit one or more
   Windows applications and then try again.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>There is not enough memory available.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
These errors may be caused by any of the following:

<UL><LI>Insufficient Memory in the Global Heap

<LI>Insufficient Windows System Resources

<LI>File Corruption, Application Problems, or Configuration Problems

<LI>Low Memory Below 1 Megabyte (MB)

<LI>Low Windows Selectors

<LI>The BIOS Is Configured Incorrectly for Your System
<P>
</UL>Each of these issues, and possible workarounds, is discussed below.
Although these issues are listed in the order they are most likely to
occur, troubleshooting insufficient memory errors in Windows is not always
a straightforward step-by-step process. To increase your knowledge of the
major issues and decrease your troubleshooting time, you may want to read
this entire article before you proceed.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Insufficient Memory in the Global Heap</h3>
 
<P>
Cause:
<P>
The entire memory area that Windows controls is called "global memory" or
the "global heap." The global heap begins at the location where MS-DOS
first loads Windows into memory and ends at the top of available memory,
which most often is at the top of physical memory. A Windows-based
application returns an insufficient memory error if the amount of free
memory in the global heap, after swapping, is insufficient to run the
application or perform the selected task.
<P>
To determine how much memory is free in the global memory heap, set your
Windows swap file to None in Control Panel's 386 Enhanced Virtual Memory
dialog box and then choose About Program Manager from the Help menu in
Program Manager. The Memory value reported is free memory in the global
heap. If your application requires more memory than is available in the
global heap, you may receive an "out of memory" error message. Increasing
the size of the swap file may allow Windows to swap enough information to
disk to free memory in the global heap.
<P>
Resolution:
<P>
To free more memory for your application, close one or more Windows-based
applications or increase the size of your permanent swap file. If this does
not correct the out of memory errors, you may need to update your system
with additional RAM.
<P>
<P><h3>Insufficient Windows System Resources</h3>
 
<P>
Cause:
<P>
Insufficient memory errors also occur when Windows calculates that not
enough system resources exist to perform the desired operation.
<P>
Status:
<P>
In Windows 3.1 and Windows for Workgroups, system resources are determined
by the following four heaps:

<UL><LI>GDI.EXE (64-kilobyte [K] data segment)
<P>
   The GDI.EXE heap contains information about graphical objects, such as
   pens, brushes, cursors, fonts, icons, buttons, scroll bars, and so on.
   In Windows 3.1 and Windows for Workgroups, the GDI heap is likely to be
   the bottleneck; therefore, closing heavily graphics-oriented
   applications results in GDI resources being freed.

<LI>USER.EXE (64K data segment)
<P>
   The USER.EXE heap contains information about the windows currently in
   existence, dialog boxes, controls in dialog boxes, and so on.

<LI>menu (64K data segment)
<LI>menu strings (64K data segment)
<P>
   The menu and menu string heaps are new in Windows 3.1. These heaps,
   originally combined in USER.EXE under Windows 3.0, were designed to free
   up space in the USER heap. These heaps are created dynamically (that is,
   at run time) by the USER heap. They are not contained in any .EXE files
   and are each limited to 64K.
<P>
</UL>When you choose About Program Manager from the Help menu, Windows and
Windows for Workgroups report the heap with the smallest amount available
as the amount of free system resources.
<P>
To maintain backwards compatibility with earlier versions of Windows and
Windows-based applications, all four heaps were each designed with a 64K
data segment limit.
<P>
Resolution:
<P>
Some applications may not release all the system resources they use after
they are closed. If you have a chronic problem with one or more
applications, contact the manufacturer of the applications for more
information.
<P>
Some 16-bit Windows applications (such as Microsoft Word for Windows,
Microsoft Access, Microsoft Visual Basic, and Microsoft Excel) require
ample free amounts of both USER.EXE and GDI.EXE heaps because of the
graphical user interface (GUI). If these applications do not find available
space to load their information into these heaps, they generate an
insufficient memory error (or a similar error). A large Excel workbook and
large graphical images on machines running high resolution video drivers
rely heavily on the GDI resource because of their graphical nature.
<P>
If your system resources are often low, keeping few applications running is
probably the best solution; however, you may also want to try the
following:

<UL><LI>Minimize seldom-used groups to conserve system resources.

<LI>Do not use wallpaper, or use a small bitmap and tile it.

<LI>Try not to open groups that have many icons.

<LI>If you run an application that uses system resources every time it runs,
   try to keep it open instead of closing and reopening it many times.

<LI>Try not to load fonts that are not needed.

<LI>Check your screen savers to make sure that they are not overusing
   resources.
<P>
</UL><h3>File Corruption, Application Problems, or Configuration Problems</h3>
 
<P>
Cause:
<P>
Insufficient memory errors may occur when two or more memory resident
programs or drivers conflict, when Windows accesses corrupted files or
files that are still in compressed form, or when there is a problem in the
application you are running.
<P>
Resolution:
<P>
Try to isolate the problem to a specific application. Clean boot the
computer so that only the necessary Windows and application-specific device
drivers and terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) programs are loading in the
CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files. For more information about a "clean
boot" for Windows and Windows for Workgroups, query on the following words
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   clean and boot and append

</PRE>Disable any applications that start automatically when you start Windows
(check the WIN.INI file and the StartUp group), run Windows Setup and
change to standard Windows drivers (VGA, No Mouse, No Network), and use the
Program Manager (PROGMAN.EXE) as your Windows shell.
<P>
If the insufficient memory errors occur only in a specific application, try
reinstalling the application to a new directory or manually expand any
necessary files to rule out file corruption.
<P>
If the application has never worked, it is possible that the files on the
original installation disks are corrupted. Try to install the offending
application on another computer using the same disks.
<P>
If these procedures do not eliminate the problem, contact the manufacturer
of the application that is causing the errors.
<P>
<P><h3>Low Memory Below 1 Megabyte (MB)</h3>
 
<P>
Cause:
<P>
When Windows creates a new task (that is, starts a new application), the
Windows loader creates a task database (TDB) for it. The TDB contains vital
information about the task, such as its current directory, its instance
handle, and so on. To maintain compatibility with 16-bit Intel processors
and MS-DOS, Windows creates the TDB in memory below 1 MB in the global
heap. Because the only memory below 1 MB in the global heap is conventional
memory, the TDB must be created below 640K (conventional memory).
<P>
Status:
<P>
Memory below 1 MB is limited and should be used sparingly. TDBs are not the
only block of memory that may end up below 1 MB. Applications such as
Microsoft Word for Windows, Microsoft Remote Access Services (RAS),
Microsoft Anti-Virus , Microsoft Mail, Microsoft Schedule+, and multimedia
packages are examples of applications that load .DLL files into the first
megabyte of memory when loading or performing certain operations.
<P>
Every segment in the Windows global heap is marked with certain attributes
that tell Windows how to manage the segment. First and foremost, the
segments are marked as Fixed or Moveable. A fixed segment always resides at
the same physical memory location where it was first allocated (although it
can be paged if it is not "page-locked"). Movable code can be moved or
marked as Discardable code. This means that Windows can move moveable
segments in memory if necessary to make room for other memory allocations
or, if the code is marked as Discardable, Windows can discard the code by
determining the "least recently used" (LRU) discardable segment. Windows
can later reload the discardable code by accessing the application's .EXE
file.
<P>
The enhanced mode global heap is composed of a series of free and in-use
blocks stored contiguously in memory. When Windows is asked by an
application to allocate a block of memory, KRNL386.EXE starts at the
beginning or end of the global heap, depending on the type of code the
application loads, and iterates through each of the blocks until it finds a
suitably sized free block.
<P>
KRNL386.EXE starts to allocate fixed segments from the bottom up in the
global heap. At the top of the global heap, Windows allocates discardable
segments. Between the fixed and discardable segments, Windows allocates
moveable segments. When an application starts and Windows needs to allocate
fixed segments, Windows starts searching from the bottom up for a
sufficiently large free block below the area of moveable segments. This is
to avoid memory fragmentation. If it cannot find a segment large enough it
begins moving moveable segments up in memory to make room. If that doesn't
work, Windows begins discarding discardable segments.
<P>
TDBs must be located below 1 MB, but fixed and moveable memory segments do
not. An insufficient memory error that appears when you try to start an
application may occur because fixed segments, which are loaded starting
from the bottom of the global heap to avoid memory fragmentation, end up
loading in the first megabyte. These fixed memory segments cannot be moved
if they are "page-locked," hence they may consume memory space that Windows
would otherwise use to load the TDBs. KRNL386.EXE's desire to keep fixed
memory as low as possible conflicts with the need to keep memory below 1 MB
as free as possible.
<P>
Because of the way Windows allocates memory, memory below 1 MB is a limited
resource even when you are running Windows-based applications. Program
developers are encouraged to ensure that their programs and .DLL files do
not use this space needlessly. Fixed memory segments should not be used
unless absolutely necessary.
<P>
Resolution:
<P>
To troubleshoot this problem, optimize conventional memory as much as
possible. If you have MS-DOS version 6.0 or 6.2, use MemMaker to optimize
conventional memory. You may also want to change the order in which your
programs or drivers load. This may alter where the fixed code gets located
and minimize memory fragmentation. For a workaround, create a multi-boot
configuration to minimize what loads into conventional memory for
particular operations. This may free enough space so that Windows can load
the TDBs.
<P>
Disable any applications that start automatically when you start Windows
(check the WIN.INI file and StartUp group), run Windows Setup and change to
standard Windows drivers (VGA, No Mouse, No Network), and use the Program
Manager (PROGMAN.EXE) as your Windows shell. For troubleshooting, remove
any third-party Windows drivers or virtual device drivers (VxDs) by
rebuilding the WIN.INI and SYSTEM.INI files. For more information about
this procedure, query on the following words in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:
<P>
<PRE>   win.ini and win.sr_ and create

   -and-

   system.ini and system.sr_ and create

</PRE><h3>Low Selectors</h3>
 
<P>
Cause:
<P>
An important aspect of Windows-based application memory management that is
NOT included in the free system resources percentage is the number of
selectors. A selector is a memory pointer that is consumed with each memory
allocation made by a Windows-based application. Windows has a fixed number
of selectors (4096 in standard mode, 8192 in 386 enhanced mode). If a
Windows-based application allocates a very large number of small data
objects, it is possible to run out of selectors. This also produces an
insufficient memory message.
<P>
Resolution:
<P>
These problems are application specific. Writing a Windows-based
application to handle its own data objects more efficiently can help in
this situation. If you experience a chronic problem with a particular
application while none or few other applications are loaded and the
computer is clean-booted, contact the application vendor. It is important
that the vendor become aware of the problem so that it can be corrected if
possible.
<P>
<P><h3>The BIOS Is Configured Incorrectly for Your System</h3>
 
<P>
If your BIOS is incorrectly configured for a floppy disk drive, you may
receive the aforementioned error messages when you attempt to install
software. For example, an error can occur if you have a 1.44-megabyte 3.5-
inch floppy disk drive installed and the BIOS is set for a 1.2-megabyte
5.25-inch disk drive.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
You can also receive "Insufficient memory" error messages if you try to
load an application over the network to run on a Windows-based computer
running an MS-DOS network client when the network is heavily congested.
Request timeouts during application loading are misinterpreted locally as
an insufficient memory condition.
<P>
Also, you can receive this error message if the Execute permission has been
removed from the network share containing the application.
