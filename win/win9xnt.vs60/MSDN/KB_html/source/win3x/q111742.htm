The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The following information was taken from the Microsoft Windows for
Workgroups version 3.11 PRINTERS.WRI file.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
4.8  Troubleshooting PostScript Printer Problems with TESTPS.TXT
<P>
Windows for Workgroups 3.11 comes with a file called TESTPS.TXT. This
file is copied into the \WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory if you install a
PostScript printer. TESTPS.TXT is used to test PostScript printers
for connection and functionality problems. To use TESTPS.TXT, copy it
to the port to which the PostScript printer is connected as follows:
<P>
COPY C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\TESTPS.TXT LPTx
or
COPY C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\TESTPS.TXT COMx
where x is the port number
<P>
If the printer is functioning correctly, it will print a page that
contains the following information:
<P>
<PRE>Max Printer VM (KB):          xxx.x
Max Suggested VM (KB):          xxx.x
Bit Rate:                    19.2 kilobits per second (Kbps) or less
Data Bits:                    7
Parity:                              None
Stop Bits:                    1
Flow Control:                    Hardware

</PRE>If the printer is not functioning or is not connected properly, no
page is printed. If no output occurs, check the following:
<P>
<PRE>  Is the printer plugged in? Is the power on? Try turning off the
</PRE>power and turning it back on again.
<P>
<PRE>  Is there paper in the printer?

  Is the correct port being used to copy TESTPS.TXT? Try copying the
</PRE>file to other available ports.
<P>
<PRE>  Is the printer cable functioning properly? Try a different cable.

  Is the LPT or serial card/port configured correctly? Check the DIP
</PRE>switches or software setup for the card.
<P>
<PRE>  Are the settings in the Ports window of the Control Panel
</PRE>configured according to the TESTPS.TXT output? To verify this, use
the following steps:
<P>
<PRE>   Open Control Panel, and then double-click the Ports icon.
   Select the active port, and then choose the Settings button.
   Compare the settings with the TESTPS.TXT output.

</PRE>5.0  Notes About Hewlett-Packard, Canon, and PCL Printers and Plotters
<P>
This section contains information specific to printing on
Hewlett-Packard, Canon, and PCL printers and plotters.
<P>
5.1  Configuring Memory on PCL Printers
<P>
If you are using a PCL printer, you may want to configure printer
memory to reserve a portion of it for permanently downloaded fonts or
macros. To do this, you can add two settings to the [HPPCL,Ports]
section of your WIN.INI file:
<P>
<PRE>  MemReserve=&lt;kilobytes&gt; specifies the amount of total printer memory
</PRE>that is reserved. For example, if you are using permanently
downloaded soft fonts that occupy 300K of memory, you can add
MemReserve=300 to your WIN.INI file. You do not need to add this
setting if you use the Font Installer program provided with Windows
for Workgroups to download your fonts. In this case, the printer
driver can automatically detect how much memory is taken up by the
fonts.
<P>
<PRE>  ResetPrinter=&lt;0, 1, 2&gt; specifies when the driver should reset
</PRE>printer memory. If the value is 0, the driver resets printer memory
when the amount of memory available for printing (the total amount
less the value for MemReserve) is low. If the value is 1, the driver
resets printer memory after printing each page. If the value is 2,
the driver never resets printer memory. In most cases, a value of 0
works, providing that the value for MemReserve is accurate. If you
are printing a large document that contains complex graphics, you may
want to specify a value of 1.
<P>
For more information about editing the WIN.INI file, see the
WININI.WRI online document.
<P>
<P>
5.2  Simulating Bold Type on PCL Printers
<P>
The Windows for Workgroups PCL driver no longer simulates bold for a
font that does not include a bold font style. For example, if you use
a cartridge or soft font in your application that includes only a
regular font style and you format text as bold, the text prints in
the regular font style on a PCL printer.
<P>
<P>
5.3  Printing from PageMaker Version 3.x to a PCL Printer
<P>
Aldus PageMaker version 3.x expects a text band to be sent if you are
printing to a PCL printer. If you are using a 3.x version of
PageMaker, you need to add the following line to the [HPPCL,Port]
section of your WIN.INI file in order to print successfully:
<P>
ForceTextBand=1
<P>
For more information about editing the WIN.INI file, see the
WININI.WRI online document.
<P>
<P>
5.4  Using the Hewlett-Packard LaserJet IIIsi in PostScript Mode
<P>
If you are using a LaserJet IIIsi printer in PostScript mode, make
sure the PRT PS ERRS option on your printer panel's menu is turned
off (this is the factory-default setting), unless you are writing
PostScript programs and need error information for debugging. If this
option is on, your print jobs pause and a message appears on your
printer's panel each time a PostScript error is encountered. In most
cases, your documents still print, but the printing process is
interrupted.
<P>
<P>
5.5  Using Intellifont for Windows Version 1.0 with Hewlett-Packard
LaserJet III Printers
<P>
If you install Intellifont for Windows version 1.0 after setting up
Windows for Workgroups version 3.11, you must reinstall the LaserJet
III printer driver by using the Printers option in Control Panel or
the Printer Setup command in Print Manager. The installation program
for Intellifont for Windows installs an earlier version of the
LaserJet III printer driver. This driver does not work correctly with
Windows for Workgroups.
<P>
5.6  Upgrading HP LaserJet Series III Printer Drivers
<P>
The HP LaserJet III printer driver included with Windows for
Workgroups is named HPPCL5MS.DRV. In earlier versions of Windows,
this driver was named HPPCL5A.DRV. If you upgrade to Windows for
Workgroups, the Setup program updates the printer driver for the HP
LaserJet III printer. However, some applications store the
information about the printer-driver file with the document, and if
you try to print a document that you created before you upgraded to
Windows for Workgroups, you may receive a message notifying you that
the printer driver cannot be found. If this happens, choose the
Printer Setup command in your application to update the driver
information stored in the document.
<P>
<P>
5.7  Using the Hewlett-Packard DeskJet 500 Printer Driver
<P>
If you are using the HP DeskJet 500 printer driver provided by
Hewlett-Packard with the HP DeskJet 500 printer, you need to adjust
the resolution setting to print at 300 dpi. To do this, first try
adjusting the resolution setting in the printer setup dialog box by
using the Printers option in Control Panel or the Printer Setup
command in Print Manager. If this doesn't work, add the following
line to the [DJ500,Port] section of your WIN.INI file:
<P>
prtresfac=0
<P>
For more information about editing the WIN.INI file, see the
WININI.WRI online document.
<P>
<P>
5.8  Printing Envelopes in Word for Windows Version 2.0  on a
Hewlett-Packard DeskJet 500 Printer
<P>
If you are using the DeskJet 500 printer driver provided with Windows
for Workgroups, you may encounter difficulties when using Word for
Windows version 2.0 to print envelopes on a Hewlett-Packard DeskJet
500 printer.
<P>
To correct the problem:

<OL><P><LI> In Word for Windows, choose the Options command from the Tools menu.

<P><LI> In the Category list, select the Win.ini button.

<P><LI> In the Option box, type hpdskjet

<P><LI> In the Setting box, type +1

<P><LI> Choose the Close button.
<P>
</OL>You can also add the following line to the [Microsoft Word 2.0]
section of your WIN.INI file:
<P>
hpdskjet=+1
<P>
For more information about editing the WIN.INI file, see the
WININI.WRI online document.
<P>
<P>
5.9  Printing TrueType Fonts on Canon Series II and III Laser Printers
<P>
The Canon series II and III laser printers do not support incremental
downloading of TrueType fonts. To print TrueType fonts by using one
of these printers, you must select the Enable TrueType Fonts check
box in the printer setup dialog box for the printer. This option
supports the printing of TrueType fonts on these printers by printing
them as graphics. This check box is selected by default when a Canon
series II or III printer is installed.
<P>
If the Enable TrueType Fonts check box is not selected, TrueType
fonts cannot be printed on these printers and are not available in
your Windows-based applications; only printer and plotter fonts are
available. For more information about setting printer options, see
Help for Print Manager.
<P>
<P>
5.10  Printing Graphics on a Canon Bubble-Jet BJ-10e or BJ-130e
<P>
If you are printing in 360x360 dpi graphics mode and part of the
graphics images in your documents are missing, make sure the DIP
switch that controls graphics image density is set to HIGH.
<P>
<P>
5.11  Adjusting Hewlett-Packard Plotter Margins
<P>
If you are using one of the plotters in the following list, you can
probably correct margin problems by experimenting with the margin
settings in your application and by turning on the Expand switch on
your plotter:
<P>
<PRE>   HP 7580 A,B (hardware switch on back panel, pin #9)
   HP 7585 A,B (hardware switch on back panel, pin #9)
   HP DraftPro DXL, EXL (hardware switch on back panel, pin #9)
   Draftmaster I, II (front panel selection)

</PRE></OL>Turning on the Expand switch increases the plotting area by setting
the outer margins to the area under the grid wheels. However, this
might decrease plot quality.
<P>
5.12  Adding Distinct DocI/Comp Pub I and Brilliant Pres I/Comp Pub
II Font Cartridges
<P>
If you need to install these font cartridges for your LaserJet III
printer, you can do so by using the Font Installer.
<P>
To install the font cartridges:

<OL><P><LI>In Print Manager, choose Printer Setup from the Options menu.

<P><LI>In the Printers dialog box, select your printer from the list of
</OL>installed printers, and then choose the Setup button.

<OL><P><LI>In the printer driver dialog box, choose the Fonts button.

<P><LI>In the Font Installer dialog box, choose the Add Fonts button.

<P><LI>In the dialog box that appears, type the path for your Windows
</OL>SYSTEM directory for example:
<P>
<PRE>     c:\windows\system

</PRE><P><LI>Select the name of the cartridge you want to install, and then
</OL>choose the OK  button.
<P>
<P>
5.13 Using the Hewlett-Packard HP-GL/2
<P>
Support for HP-GL/2 is in the HPPCL5E driver.  Under the Options
Dialog in the Printer Setup, an option of "Graphics Mode" is
available.  Two options are present:  HP-GL/2 or Raster.  The first
choice enables HP-GL/2 which will increase print performance.  The
second choice uses raster only.  The default graphics mode is set to
raster for the HP LaserJet 4L.  The default mode is set to HP-GL/2
for the HP LaserJet 4/4M and 4Si/4Si MX.
<P>
For the HP LaserJet 4/4M and 4Si/4Si MX, if you encounter print
difficulties in the default Graphics Mode, it is recommended that you
change the mode to Raster and try your print job again. Additional
information on this topic may be found in the help files that
accompany this driver.  Choose Help from the driver dialog screens or
the HP font installer screens to access the HELP information.
<P>
<P>
6.0  Notes About Additional Printers and Font Packages
<P>
This section contains information specific to font packages and
printing on dot-matrix, 24-pin, Epson, and IBM printers.
<P>
<P>
6.1  Feeding Paper on Fujitsu Dot-Matrix Printers
<P>
The manual-feed option is not supported on Fujitsu dot-matrix
printers. All paper is automatically fed to the printer from the
roller.
<P>
<P>
6.2  Printing to an IBM Personal Pageprinter, Using the EPT Port
<P>
For best results, use the IBM Personal Pageprinter Adapter Program
version 1.3.1 or later.
<P>
If you want to print to an IBM Personal Pageprinter assigned to the
EPT port, you must set the LPT1 device contention to never issue a
warning. For more information about managing device requests, see
Help for Control Panel.
<P>
<P>
6.3  Printing to an IBM Proprinter X24 or XL24, Epson MX-80, or
Okidata 24-Pin Printer
<P>
Because Print Manager sometimes interrupts the flow of data while
printing, you might notice erratic output if you are using an IBM
Proprinter X24 or XL24, Epson MX-80, or Okidata 24-pin dot-matrix
printer when Print Manager is active. These printers cannot
accommodate interruptions in data flow. To solve this problem, try
deactivating Print Manager.
<P>
If you still have problems after deactivating Print Manager, use the
following procedure.
<P>
To print to a file and then send the file to a printer:

<OL><P><LI> Using the Printer Setup command in Print Manager or the Printers
</OL>option in Control Panel, connect to the port named FILE.

<OL><P><LI> Choose the Print command in your Windows application.

<P><LI> Copy the print file to the port your printer is connected to.
<P>
</OL>For more information about activating and deactivating Print Manager
and printing to a file, see Help for Print Manager. For more
information about printing to a file, see your MS-DOS documentation.
<P>
Note: This problem should not occur when you are printing on an IBM
Proprinter X24e or XL24e.
<P>
<P>
6.4  Using Fonts with the Epson LQ-510, LQ-850, and LQ-1050 Printers
<P>
The Epson LQ-510, LQ-850, and LQ-1050 printer drivers support the
full set of fonts provided with the latest versions of these printer
models. Earlier versions of these printer models support only the
Roman and Sans Serif fonts.
<P>
<P>
6.5  Printing TrueType Fonts on Kyocera F-Series Printers
<P>
To print TrueType Fonts on Kyocera F-Series printers, you must select
the Print TrueType As Graphics check box in the Options dialog box
when configuring your printer. Otherwise, TrueType fonts may not
print correctly. For more information about configuring printers, see
Help for Print Manager.
<P>
<P>
6.6  Changing Printer Settings When Using Bitstream FaceLift Version 1.0
<P>
With some applications, you can change the settings for your printer
on a per- page basis. If you are using the Facelift version 1.0
soft-font package from Bitstream, you cannot use this feature when
you are printing multiple-page documents.
<P>
<P>
6.7  Using the Cut-Sheet Feeder on the NEC Pinwriter P7 Printer
<P>
The Paper Source option, Cut Sheet Feeder, does not work properly
with the NEC Pinwriter P7 printer. To use the cut-sheet feeder as the
paper source, you must specify a left margin of about three inches
for your document so that text prints correctly on the page.
<P>
6.8 Using Separator Pages
<P>
If you are using one of the following printer models and the printer
is a local printer (attached to your computer), do not use the
separator-page feature in Print Manager. This feature is not
supported in these printer models.

<P>
<P>
7.0 Troubleshooting
<P>
7.1 Troubleshooting Garbled Output
<P>
If you get garbled output on a printer, it may be due to one of the
following problems:

<OL><P><LI>Your network adapter and LPT1 port may have a conflicting IObase
</OL>address, such as 370. You need to change the IObase address of the
network adapter.

<OL><P><LI>If you are using a NetWare server and PRINTCON.DAT is set up for
</OL>text mode or is not in the SYS directory for your Novell network
installation, Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 will not print
TrueType fonts correctly. One of the functions of PRINTCON.DAT is to
set up the default data stream type. Without a PRINTCON.DAT file, the
default is a "TEXT" data stream.
<P>
To correct this problem, use the Novell PRINTCON utility to generate
a PRINTCON.DAT file with a default data stream of "BITSTREAM". Once
this is done, TrueType fonts should print normally.
<P>
