The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a

<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If you want to use a DOS mouse driver with a Logitech mouse in conjunction
with Microsoft Windows 3.0, you must use version 4.1 or later of the
Logitech DOS mouse driver.
<P>
Windows 3.0 does not use the DOS mouse driver; it uses its own internal
mouse driver. However, if you want to use a mouse in DOS applications, a
DOS mouse driver is necessary.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Logitech version 4.1 driver has the following attributes:
<P>
<PRE>   Driver     Size   Date
   ------     ----   ----

   MOUSE.COM  19784  10-02-89
   MOUSE.SYS  19898  10-02-89

</PRE>Note that since these drivers have the same names as the Microsoft
equivalents, the Windows version 3.0 Setup program normally replaces
them with the new Microsoft version 7.04 DOS mouse driver.
<P>
NOTE: The Microsoft 7.04 driver should NOT be used. Make sure to use
the Logitech driver 4.1 or later.
<P>
Using the wrong driver may cause loss of mouse operation or pixels to
be left on the screen when the mouse is moved.
<P>
Version 4.1 of the Logitech DOS mouse driver can be obtained from
Logitech Technical Support or by modem from the Logitech electronic
bulletin board service.
<P>
The Logitech products included here are manufactured by a vendor
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise,
regarding these products' performance or reliability.
