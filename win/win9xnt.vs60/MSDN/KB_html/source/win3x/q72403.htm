<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
There are two methods of printing multiple copies of a print job. These
methods vary only slightly, but affect the speed in printing.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1</h3>
 
<P>
If you choose the Print command from the File menu in your Windows
application, you can select the number of copies of the file to be printed.
This causes Windows to send that many copies to the print spooler, and
subsequently to the printer. This method can be very slow if you are
printing many copies.
<P>
This method is called "collated," and is a function of the application.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 2</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>From the File menu, choose Printer Setup.
<P>
   -or-
<P>
   From the Control Panel, select Printers.

<P><LI>Select the printer, then click on the Setup button. From the
   Control Panel, you first need to click on the Configure button.
<P>
</OL>You are presented with the printer options supported by the printer driver.
Some printer drivers (such as the HP LaserJet series) have a Copies option
available. By changing the number of copies in this box, you can speed up
the printing process. For each job sent to the print spooler, this
number of copies is created; therefore, only one copy of a print job needs
to be downloaded to create any number of copies.
<P>
This method is called "uncollated," and is a function of the printer
driver. This method is not necessarily supported by every printer driver.
<P>
