Microsoft Windows 3.0 cannot run in 386 enhanced mode on a workstation that
was booted from a network server. Microsoft has an Application Note,
"WW0407: RIPLMEM.EXE for Remote Boot Workstations and Windows 386 Enhanced
Mode," that corrects this problem.

</PRE>The enclosed disk contains RIPLMEM.EXE, a memory-resident program that
allows you to run Windows version 3.00 in 386 enhanced mode on
workstations that are booted from a network server (not from a local
floppy or hard disk drive).
<P>
<P><h3>Using RIPLMEM.EXE</h3>
 
<P>
To enable 386 enhanced mode on a workstation:

<OL><P><LI>Copy RIPLMEM.EXE from the enclosed disk to a location that the
   workstation can access while it is running Windows. For example,
   copy the file to the Windows directory (or copy the file to the
   workstation's hard disk, if the workstation has a hard disk).

<P><LI>Make sure that the workstation's path line includes both the drive
   and directory where RIPLMEM.EXE is located. Then, following the
   path line, insert a line that reads:
<P>
<P><PRE>      RIPLMEM
</PRE><P>
   If you place the file on a network drive, make sure the workstation
   connects to the network before it attempts to start RIPLMEM.EXE.

<P><LI>Restart the workstation. RIPLMEM.EXE should start at this time.

<P><LI>Use the /3 switch to start Windows 3.00 in 386 enhanced mode on the
   workstation. For example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      win /3
</PRE><P>
</OL>To use RIPLMEM.EXE properly:

<UL><LI>Make sure RIPLMEM.EXE is on a drive that Windows can always gain
   access to. In other words, don't put the file on a drive that can
   be accessed only while the workstation is being started.

<LI>Do not move the RIPLMEM.EXE file while RIPLMEM is running. If you
   do, the program will be disabled, and you will need to restart the
   workstation to restart the program.
