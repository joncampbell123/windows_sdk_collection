The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
It is possible to mix the touch-tone and pulse-dialing capabilities of
a Hayes or Hayes-compatible modem when you dial from Windows Cardfile
or Windows Terminal. This capability allows the modem to mix dialing
methods when dialing a series of numbers.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Hayes and Hayes-compatible modems use the "AT" command set. "AT" is
used to get the attention of the modem. The command for tone dialing
is "ATDT" followed by a phone number. ("DT" indicates tone dial.) The
command for pulse dialing is "ATDP" followed by the phone number.
("DP" indicates pulse dial.)
<P>
Some phone systems are restricted to pulse dialing until an outside
line or other phone service is reached by dialing a prefix, such as
"9." Because tone dialing is faster than pulse dialing, you may want
to dial the prefix in pulse and then switch to tone dialing for the
actual phone number.
<P>
Listed below are the steps to mix tone and pulse dialing with Cardfile
and Terminal.
<P>
<P><h3>Cardfile</h3>
 
<P>
Cardfile allows you to call another party without actually connecting
the two modems. To dial a number with Cardfile, use the following
steps:

<OL><P><LI>From the Card menu, choose Autodial; or, press F5.

<P><LI>In the Autodial dialog box, choose the Setup button, and select
   either the Tone or Pulse option button to set the default dialing
   method. To pulse dial a prefix and then tone dial the phone number,
   select the Pulse option as the default.

<P><LI>Select the Use Prefix check box.

<P><LI>To dial a prefix in pulse, type the proper number in the Prefix box
   and add the letter "T." ("T" instructs the modem to switch to tone
   dialing after it pulse dials the prefix.)
<P>
   Some phone systems may require a pause between dialing the prefix and
   dialing the phone number. In such cases, add a comma to the prefix to
   allow a two-second pause before the phone number is dialed.
<P>
</OL>For example, you might use the following settings in the Autodial
dialog box:
<P>
<PRE>   Number: 555-1212
   Prefix:     9T,

</PRE></OL>Note: A modem that is set for tone dialing can be switched to pulse
dialing by inserting a "P" instead of a "T." In Cardfile, the "P" or
"T" can also be inserted in the phone number, rather than the prefix.
<P>
For more information about using automatic dialing with Cardfile,
refer to pages 446-447 of the "Microsoft Windows User's Guide" for
version 3.1.
<P>
<P><h3>Terminal</h3>
 
<P>
Terminal can connect two modems together and enable two computers to
exchange information. The settings to switch dialing modes in Terminal
are similar to those in Cardfile. To modify the settings in Terminal,
use the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>From the Settings menu, choose Modem Commands. The default prefix
   for tone dialing is "ATDT." Change it to "ATDP" to make Terminal use
   pulse dialing.

<P><LI>To make Terminal pulse dial the prefix "9," pause before tone
   dialing a phone number, type the following in the Dial field of the
   Modem Commands dialog box:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ATDP9,T
</PRE><P>
   Change this setting to "ATDT9,P" to make Terminal first use tone
   dialing and then switch to pulse dialing.
<P>
</OL>Note: In Terminal, the "P" and "T" commands cannot be entered with the
phone number because Terminal converts any letters in the phone number
to numbers. These commands must be placed in the prefix.
<P>
For more information about using Terminal, refer to Chapter 11 of the
"Microsoft Windows User's Guide" for version 3.1.
