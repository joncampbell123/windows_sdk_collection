The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 4.0, 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you send a fax from Microsoft Excel with Microsoft At Work PC Fax by
choosing Send Mail from the File menu, you may receive one of the following
error messages:

<UL><LI>A document with the name &lt;filename&gt; is already open
<P>
   -or-

<LI>General Protection fault in the file VBA.DLL
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Undeliverable Mail - Error while rendering fax
<P>
</UL>NOTE: This problem does not occur with other Microsoft Office applications.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When you send mail from an application and address the message to a FAX
recipient, Microsoft Mail calls the application associated with the
attached document to render (print) the document to generate the final .DCX
output file. Because Microsoft Excel does not support having two copies of
the same document open simultaneously, you receive one of the errors noted
above.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem in Microsoft Excel 5.0:

<OL><P><LI>From the Microsoft Excel File menu, choose Print.

<P><LI>Choose Printer Setup.

<P><LI>Choose "Microsoft At Work Fax on FAX:" and then choose OK twice.
<P>
</OL>To work around this problem in Microsoft Excel 4.0:

<OL><P><LI>From the Microsoft Excel File menu, choose Page Setup.

<P><LI>Choose Printer Select.

<P><LI>Choose "Microsoft At Work Fax" as the default printer.
<P>
</OL>When you fax a document this way, the application renders the document, and
then a Mail message is created with an attached .DCX file.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you choose the File Send command, Microsoft Excel embeds the active
sheet in a mail message. The embedded object uses the name of the active
sheet and is given the extension .XLS. When the message is ready to be
faxed, Microsoft Mail activates the object. Upon activation, the embedded
sheet is copied to the TEMP directory and Microsoft Excel is told to open
it. After the file is opened, a Print command is sent to Microsoft Excel,
and the file is printed to the fax port.
<P>
The aforementioned errors occur when the embedded file uses the same name
as the workbook that is already open in Microsoft Excel. The embedded sheet
fails to open, Microsoft Excel displays a message indicating there is
already a file with that name open, and the fax is never sent.
<P>
Application Note WG0992, "Updated Files for Microsoft At Work PC Fax
Version 1.0," addresses a similar issue. If the steps taken above do not
correct this problem, you may want to order WG0992. For information about
