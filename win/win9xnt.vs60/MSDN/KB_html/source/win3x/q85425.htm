The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows &amp; MS-DOS 5 for IBM PS/2
</UL> 
<P>
Summary:
<P>
The following information was taken from the Windows &amp; MS-DOS 5 for
IBM PS/2 SETUP.TXT file.
<P>
More Information:
<P>
<P><h2>SETUP.TXT for Microsoft Windows 3.1 and MS-DOS 5.0</h2>
 
<P>
This file contains information about problems that may occur while
running the Windows and MS-DOS Setup program and describes problems
that can occur when using terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) programs
or drivers with Windows or the Windows and MS-DOS Setup program. If
you are using a TSR or if you encounter problems setting up Windows
version 3.1, read this document BEFORE running Setup again.
<P>
Note: Within this document, "Windows Setup" refers to the Windows part
of the Windows and MS-DOS Setup program.  You can execute the Windows
only part of this program by following the instructions below:
<P>
When this file instructs you to run Windows Setup, do the following:
<P>
--If this file instructs you to run Setup from the Main Group within
<PRE>  the Windows Program Manager, carry out the procedure as stated.

</PRE>--If you have not installed Microsoft Windows and MS-DOS,
<PRE>  carry out the procedure described in "Running Setup" in the
  Microsoft Windows and MS-DOS Getting Started manual.  In
  this case, you will have to install MS-DOS before you install
  Windows.

</PRE>--If you have installed Microsoft Windows and MS-DOS, and this
<PRE>  file does not instruct you to run Setup from the Main Group,
  carry out the following procedure to run Setup for Windows only:

  1. Make drive C your current drive.
  2. Insert Setup Disk #1 into drive A.
  3. Type the following at the C&gt; command prompt:
        a:setup

  This procedure for running a "Windows only" setup after MS-DOS has
  been installed is also described in Appendix B of the Windows and
  MS-DOS Getting Started manual.


</PRE><h2>General Setup Notes for the Windows portion of Setup</h2>
 
This section includes notes on specific system configurations that may
prevent Setup from installing Windows successfully. A solution to each
problem is provided.
<P>
If you are using a hardware or software product listed here, follow
the proposed recommendations before running Setup.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>MS-DOS Screen Savers</h3>
 
If you are using an MS-DOS screen saver, you should disable it before
running Setup. These screen savers can cause problems when running
Setup.
<P>
<P>
COMPAQ Computer with MS-DOS Version 5.0 and EGA or VGA
 
If you are using the upgrade version of Microsoft MS-DOS 5.0, check
your CONFIG.SYS file to make sure the following drivers appear in this
order:
<P>
<PRE>    HIMEM.SYS
    EMM386.EXE
    ANSI.SYS

</PRE>Note: If you are using the COMPAQ version of MS-DOS 5.0, HIMEM.EXE is
<PRE>      used in place of HIMEM.SYS and CEMM.EXE is used in place of
      EMM386.EXE.

</PRE>If ANSI.SYS is loaded before HIMEM.SYS or EMM386.EXE (or if you are
using COMPAQ MS-DOS 5.0 before HIMEM.EXE or CEMM.EXE), Setup may
restart your system before Windows is installed. Also, if you are
using the DOS=HIGH,UMB command line to load MS-DOS into upper memory,
loading EMM386.EXE (or CEMM.EXE) before loading ANSI.SYS will create
the maximum amount of upper memory space on a COMPAQ computer.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>AT&amp;T Safari Computer</h3>
 
<P>
If you have an AT&amp;T Safari computer, you cannot maintain two versions
of Windows (version 3.0 and version 3.1) on your system. You must
upgrade over version 3.0. If you set up Windows 3.1 in its own
directory, Windows will not use the special drivers required for it to
run on the Safari computer.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Using the TIGA Display Driver</h3>
 
<P>
After successfully setting up Windows, you can increase the amount of
conventional memory available to non-Windows applications when Windows
is running in 386 enhanced mode by loading TIGACD.EXE from the
WINSTART.BAT file. The WINSTART.BAT file runs only in 386 enhanced
mode. If you want to run Windows in standard mode, you must load
TIGACD.EXE manually. For more information, see the README.WRI online
document.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Displays That Are Incompatible with Windows Version 3.1</h3>
 
<P>
Certain display adapters can cause problems with Windows version 3.1.
The most serious problem is a system failure while running the Windows
and MS-DOS Setup program. If you encounter this problem, run Custom
Setup, and then select one of the standard display types, such as VGA,
provided with Windows version 3.1.
<P>
With other display drivers, Windows may be set up successfully but
TrueType fonts may not appear correctly on your screen. An updated
driver may be available in the Windows Driver Library or from your
display vendor or manufacturer. For information about obtaining the
Windows Driver Library, see "Microsoft Windows and MS-DOS Getting
Started."
<P>
The following display adapters may cause problems:
<P>
-  ATI Graphics Ultra and Vantage
<P>
<PRE>   NOTE: These adapters are 8514/a-compatible and run well
         with the 8514/a driver provided with Windows 3.1.

</PRE>- All DGIS display adapters (Direct Graphics Interface Standard)
<PRE>  from Graphic Software Systems, including the following:
        NEC MultiSynch Graphics Engine (MGE)
        Zenith Z-649
        HP IGC-10, IGC-20
        GSS 1000 Series

   NOTE: Some DGIS-based adapters are TIGA-compatible and
         run well when used with the appropriate TIGACD.EXE
         MS-DOS driver and with the TIGA driver provided with
         Windows 3.1.

</PRE>- HP Ultra VGA
- IBM Image Adapter/A
- Matrox MG Series/M-WIN Series
- Palettized VGA 640x480, 16-color (provided with Windows
<PRE>  Multimedia Extensions version 1.0)
</PRE>- Radius SVGA MultiView
<P>
- All RGDI (Renaissance Graphics Device Interface) display
<PRE>  adapters from Appian, Inc., including the following:
       Appian Rendition II, IIe, II/XE, and III
       Appian GV1024
       Decpc 433

</PRE>- All S3 adapters, including the following:
<PRE>      Orchid Fahrenheit 1280
      STB WIND/X
      Diamond Stealth VRAM


</PRE><h3>Using Stacker</h3>
 
<P>
If you are using Stacker to compress your hard disk, there are certain
steps you need to take before setting up Windows. ]
<P>
*  Before you run Setup, install MS-DOS 5.0 manually. For
<PRE>   instructions, see section 2.21 of the README.TXT file.

</PRE>*  If you want to use a swap file with Windows, you must set up the
<PRE>   swap file on the uncompressed drive. When setting up Stacker, you
   can leave at least 1 megabyte (MB) of disk space uncompressed for
   storing system files. To  leave enough space for the swap file, it
   is recommended that the amount of uncompressed disk space equal at
   least twice the amount of system memory. For example, if your
   system has 4 MB of memory, you should leave at least 8 MB of disk
   space uncompressed. For more information about swap files, see
   "Working with Windows Swap Files" in Chapter 14, "Optimizing
   Windows," in the "Microsoft Windows User's Guide."

   If Stacker is already set up on your system and there is not enough
   uncompressed disk space for a swap file, you can run the STAC
   utility provided with Stacker to increase the amount of
   uncompressed disk space. For more information, see your Stacker
   documentation.

</PRE>*  If you upgraded from an earlier version of Stacker to
<PRE>   Stacker 2.0 or later, choose the Custom Setup option
   when you run Setup. When Setup prompts you, don't choose to let
   Setup modify your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files. Modify
   these files yourself after Setup is complete, by carrying out
   the following steps:

   * In your AUTOEXEC.BAT, add Windows to your path.

   * Copy the HIMEM.SYS and EMM386.EXE files to your
     uncompressed drive, unless you use a different memory
     manager, such as QEMM-386.

   * Add DEVICE commands for HIMEM.SYS and EMM386.EXE to
     your CONFIG.SYS, unless you use a different memory manager
     such as QEMM-386. The command lines that load these drivers
     should appear before the command that loads STACKER.COM.

   * Make sure a copy of SMARTDRV.EXE is on the
     uncompressed drive. In your CONFIG.SYS file, the
     SMARTDRV.EXE command line should include the
     "/double_buffer" switch and should be the path
     of the file at boot time. For example, if SMARTDRV.EXE
     is in the root directory at boot time, you would include
     the following command in your CONFIG.SYS:

     DEVICE=C:\SMARTDRV.EXE DOUBLE_BUFFER

     SMARTDRV.EXE should be loaded before STACKER.COM in the
     CONFIG.SYS file.

   * In the AUTOEXEC.BAT file, the SMARTDRV.EXE command
     line should be the path of the file after disk drives
     are swapped.

</PRE>*  If you are using Stacker version 2.0 or later, but didn't
<PRE>   upgrade from Stacker version 1.1, choose the Express Setup
   option when you are prompted. Setup will modify your CONFIG.SYS
   and AUTOEXEC.BAT files for you. When Setup is finished making
   the modifications, it displays a message at the end
   of the Windows portion of Setup that notifies you of the
   modifications that have been made. If you have used Stacker to
   swap your startup drive, when you restart your system Stacker will
   ask whether you want to update to the new version of the
   CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT file. Choose Yes.

</PRE>*  If you are using a version of Stacker earlier than 2.0, you
<PRE>   need to modify your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files
   yourself, using the CONFIG.WIN and AUTOEXEC.WIN files that
   Setup generates. For information about using these files,
   see "Modifying Your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT Files Yourself,"
   following this topic.

</PRE>*  After you have set up MS-DOS manually, type the following at
<PRE>   the command prompt to set up Windows:

   a:setup /w

</PRE><h3>Modifying Your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT Files Yourself</h3>
 
When you set up Windows, Setup usually places the HIMEM.SYS,
SMARTDRV.EXE, and EMM386.EXE files in the Windows directory.
If the Windows directory is on a disk that is not available
when you start your computer, such as a removable or nonlocal
disk, or if Setup detects one of the following conditions,
Setup does not modify the CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT file:
<P>
- Your boot drive has been modified by a disk-compression
<PRE>  utility.

</PRE>- Your CONFIG.SYS file contains references to block device
<PRE>  drivers.

</PRE>- There is not enough available space on your hard disk to
<PRE>  copy the files.

</PRE>- The files are already installed on your system and Setup
<PRE>  cannot overwrite them (they are read-only).

</PRE>Instead, Setup writes proposed changes to the CONFIG.WIN and
AUTOEXEC.WIN or the CONFIG.00x and AUTOEXEC.00x files.
In this case, you must either move the HIMEM.SYS, SMARTDRV.EXE,
and EMM386.EXE files to a drive that is available when you start
your computer, or use a text editor to modify your CONFIG.SYS or
AUTOEXEC.BAT file so that any references to HIMEM.SYS,
SMARTDRV.EXE, and EMM386.EXE appear after the device=
command line used to load the drivers for your disk drives. Refer
to the CONFIG.WIN and AUTOEXEC.WIN or the CONFIG.00x and
AUTOEXEC.00x files for the proposed changes.
<P>
NOTE
Setup may also create AUTOEXEC.OLD and CONFIG.OLD files
if it cannot modify your startup files. (These files may also
be named AUTOEXEC.00x and CONFIG.00x if AUTOEXEC.OLD and
CONFIG.OLD already exist.) If Setup creates AUTOEXEC.OLD
or CONFIG.OLD files, note the reason that it does so. Then
merge the CONFIG.OLD and CONFIG.WIN files with the CONFIG.SYS
file, and the AUTOEXEC.OLD and AUTOEXEC.WIN files with the
AUTOEXEC.BAT file.
<P>
<P><h3>Setting Up XGA on a PS/2 Model 75 or 90</h3>
 
<P>
If you have a PS/2 model 75 or 90 with an XGA, the Windows and MS-DOS
Setup program will configure the display adapter for 16-color, 640x480
resolution. Do not change this configuration during Setup. Specifying
a different XGA configuration while setting up Windows may cause Setup
to fail.
<P>
After you have successfully installed Windows, you can configure your
XGA to use a different resolution or 256 colors, if your monitor
supports it. For more information on how to do this, see the topic
"IBM XGA" in the README.WRI online document.
<P>
If you are using the plasma screen on the PS/2 model 75, use ONLY the
640x480, 16-color configuration. If you change this configuration, you
will be returned to the MS-DOS prompt when you try to start Windows.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Correcting the "Out of Environment Space" Error Message</h3>
 
<P>
If you receive an "out of environment space" message when starting
Windows, you can either:
<P>
*  Increase the size of your environment by adding the SHELL=
<PRE>   command line to your CONFIG.SYS file. See your MS-DOS
   documentation for more information about the SHELL command
   and modifying your CONFIG.SYS file.

</PRE>*  Move the SET commands in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file
<PRE>   to the beginning of the file so that they run before the
   commands that load terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR)
   programs or drivers, such as SMARTDrive.


</PRE>If Setup Does Not Detect Your Network
 
If you have a network installed, you choose Custom Setup, and Setup
specifies "No Network" in the System-Information screen, Setup is not
able to detect your network. For Setup to detect certain networks, the
directory that contains the network program files must be included in
your path.
<P>
This is a known problem with these networks: 3Share, 3Open, LAN
Manager, and MSNet. If your path does not include the directory where
the network files are located, you can either:
<P>
*  Add the directory to the PATH line in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.
<P>
*  Run Custom Setup again and specify the full path for your
<PRE>   network in the System-Information screen.


</PRE>Using Terminate-and-Stay-Resident (TSR) Programs
and Drivers with Windows Version 3.1
 
<P>
The Program Listing section of this document lists several terminate-
and-stay-resident (TSR) programs and drivers that are known to cause
problems when running with Windows version 3.1. Some of the problems
you may encounter include system failures or an incorrect display of
information on your screen. In some cases, special steps are provided
to solve the problems.
<P>
While setting up Windows version 3.1, the Windows portion of Setup
searches the AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS files for references to TSR
programs and drivers, in addition to scanning memory for TSRs that are
currently running. If Setup detects a TSR that is known to cause
problems when running with Windows version 3.1, a message appears,
asking whether you want to continue or quit Setup.
<P>
If you receive such a message, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Locate your TSR in the Program Listing section of this document
   and use the information to determine if the situation encountered
   prevents Windows Setup from successfully installing Windows 3.1.

<P><LI>If the situation does not affect Windows Setup, you can continue
   setting up Windows 3.1 by following the instructions on your
   screen.
<P>
   If the situation does affect Windows Setup and prevents it from
   installing Windows on your computer, follow the instructions
   on the screen to quit Setup, and then complete the following
   steps.

<P><LI>Quit the TSR and remove all references to it from your
   AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS files. For more information,
   see the documentation for your TSR.

<P><LI>Restart your computer.

<P><LI>Run Windows Setup again.
<P>
</OL>After Windows is successfully set up, you may want to restore your
TSRs.
<P>
Not all TSRs or drivers included in the Program Listing section are
detected by Setup. The TSRs and drivers that Setup detects are in the
SETUP.INF file, listed under the names "incomptsr1" and "incomptsr2".
<P>
<P><h2>Program Listing</h2>
 
This section describes some problems, discovered during testing,
that you might encounter while using a TSR with Windows version 3.1.
It does not include all possible problems that can occur.
<P>
<P><h3>386MAX</h3>
 
The documentation for 386MAX recommends against setting the EXT
parameter below 64. If you set this parameter to 0, Windows Setup and
Windows running in standard mode will fail.
<P>
See the README.WRI online document for more information about running
386MAX with Windows 3.1.
<P>
<P><h3>386MAX Disk-Cache Utility (QCACHE.EXE)</h3>
 
Do not use this disk-cache utility simultaneously with SMARTDrive.
There is no reason to use two disk-cache utilities with Windows. It is
recommended that you use SMARTDrive, which is installed with Windows
3.1, instead.
<P>
<P><h3>All Charge 386 Version 3.1</h3>
 
<P>
ALLEMM4.SYS is a memory manager that causes problems with Setup and
Windows 3.1. If you encounter problems running this program with
Windows, it is recommended that you use EMM386.EXE and HIMEM.SYS,
provided with Windows 3.1, to manage memory instead.
<P>
<P><h3>Anarkey Version 4.00</h3>
 
With some memory configurations, Anarkey version 4.00 running with
Windows 3.1 in 386 enhanced mode may cause unpredictable  system
failures. In rare cases, this program can also corrupt hard-disk data.
In addition, Windows 3.1 might not start when this program is running.
<P>
Do not run Windows 3.1 in 386 enhanced mode when Anarkey version
4.00 is running. Version 4.01 may correct these problems. Contact
Moderne Software for a free upgrade of Anarkey 4.01.
<P>
<P><h3>Anarkey Version 4.01</h3>
 
If Anarkey version 4.01 is loaded before starting Windows in standard
mode, it is not available in any MS-DOS Prompt that you start from
Windows. In this case, it is recommended that you load Anarkey from
each MS-DOS Prompt, as needed.
<P>
Do not load Anarkey HIGH before starting Windows in 386 enhanced mode.
If you load Anarkey HIGH, your system may fail when you try to start
an application.
<P>
<P><h3>APPEND (MS-DOS)</h3>
 
<P>
Do not use the APPEND utility with Windows 3.1. It prevents Windows
and Windows applications from creating valid Well-Formed-Path (WFP)
names for the files they are using. (A WFP is the complete name of a
file, including the drive letter and full path specification, starting
from the root
directory.)
<P>
<P><h3>ASP Integrity Toolkit Version 3.7</h3>
 
<P>
This product is a virus-protection program that can cause problems
when running Windows Setup, including system failure, automatic
restarting of the system, and the inability to use the keyboard. You
should turn off protection in the toolkit before setting up Windows
3.1. For information about how to do this, see your ASP Integrity
documentation.
<P>
NOTE: Setting up Windows is considered a system-administration task.
<PRE>      The ASP Integrity Toolkit documentation instructs you to turn
      off protection when performing these types of tasks.

</PRE></OL><h3>Autocon Version 2.0e</h3>
 
<P>
Autocon enables you to select up to fifty different configurations
when starting your system. To do this, it modifies the CONFIG.SYS
and AUTOEXEC.BAT files, based on information in its database
(AUTOCON.DAT), when you restart your system from within AUTOCON.
<P>
Windows Setup modifies only the first section in the CONFIG.SYS and
AUTOEXEC.BAT files. If you want to use specific configurations with
Windows, you must run Autocon and then manually edit the
configurations in the database that you want to use. You must do this
after setting up Windows. For your changes to take effect, you must
restart your system from within Autocon. For more information, see
your Autocon documentation.
<P>
<P><h3>Bootcon Version 1.60</h3>
 
<P>
Using Bootcon, you can maintain different system-configuration
information in your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files. You can then
select the configuration you want to use from a menu when starting
your system.
<P>
Windows Setup modifies only the first section in the CONFIG.SYS
and AUTOEXEC.BAT files. You must edit the sections of those files
that contain the configurations you want to use after you set up
Windows. For more information, see your Bootcon documentation.
<P>
BOOT.SYS
 
Using BOOT.SYS, you can maintain different system-configuration
information in your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files. You can
then select the configuration you want to use from a menu when
starting your system.
<P>
Windows Setup modifies only the first section in the CONFIG.SYS
and AUTOEXEC.BAT files. You must edit the sections of those files
that contain the configurations you want to use after you set
up Windows. For more information, see your BOOT.SYS documentation.
<P>
<P><h3>Bootsafe</h3>
 
<P>
If you are running Bootsafe, you may experience problems while
running Setup. Carry out the following procedure:

<OL><P><LI>Open your AUTOEXEC.BAT with any text editor.
</OL>2. Type "REM" and a space in front of the line that loads
<PRE>   Bootsafe. For example, the line might look something like this:

      rem c:\cpav\bootsafe

</PRE><P><LI>Save the file, and restart your computer by pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL.
</OL>4. Run Setup again.
<P>
<P><h3>CACHE.EXE Disk-Cache Utility</h3>
 
<P>
Do not use two disk-cache utilities with Windows 3.1. It is
recommended that you use SMARTDrive, provided with Windows 3.1, and
remove all references to other disk-cache utilities from your
CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files. (If CACHE.EXE is detected, Setup
removes it from the CONFIG.SYS file for you.)
<P>
<P><h3>CACHE.SYS Disk-Cache Utility</h3>
 
<P>
This disk-cache utility will not work properly with SMARTDrive. It is
recommended that you use SMARTDrive, provided with Windows 3.1, and
remove all references to other disk-cache utilities from your
CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files. (If CACHE.SYS is detected, Setup
removes it from the CONFIG.SYS file for you.)
<P>
<P><h3>CED Version 1.0e</h3>
 
<P>
Using CED with Windows 3.1 may cause problems, including system
failure. It is recommended that you do not use CED with Windows 3.1.
<P>
<P><h3>Central Point Anti-Virus Version 1.1 (VSAFE.COM/VSAFE.SYS)</h3>
 
<P>
VSAFE.COM/VSAFE.SYS should not be loaded when you set up Windows 3.1.
Otherwise, Setup may not run properly. After you set up Windows 3.1,
you can load VSAFE.
<P>
Because Windows uses the disk for memory swapping, you should turn off
the VSAFE write-protection option when running Windows. For more
information, see the Central Point Anti-Virus documentation.
<P>
<P><h3>CMDEDIT.COM Version 2.0 (Date 12-6-91)</h3>
 
<P>
If this command-line editor is loaded before starting Windows, it may
cause a General Protection Fault when running multiple MS-DOS Prompts
in 386 enhanced mode. Also, it cannot be loaded from an MS-DOS Prompt
within Windows when Windows is running in standard mode.
<P>
<P><h3>Cubit Version 3.01</h3>
 
<P>
When using Cubit with Windows 3.1, do not compress the Windows SYSTEM
directory or any file that is loaded from the CONFIG.SYS file.
Compressing these files could cause problems.
<P>
Before upgrading to Windows 3.1, make sure that the earlier version of
Windows is uncompressed on your hard disk. You may recompress the
files after you have successfully set up Windows 3.1.
<P>
<P><h3>Data Physician Plus Version 2.0 (VirALERT)</h3>
 
<P>

Windows 3.1 may try to access "phantom" disk drives if you use
Doubledisk with Windows 3.1. Phantom drives occur when you use
Doubledisk to create a compressed drive. For example, if you have
drives A, B, and C on your computer and you use Doubledisk to create
drive F, Windows 3.1 (and MS-DOS) recognize drives D and E as valid
drives, even though they do not actually exist. You can use the DRVOFF
utility to prevent Windows from recognizing phantom drives. Contact
Vertisoft to order a copy of the DRVOFF utility.
