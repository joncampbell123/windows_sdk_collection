<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
According to STB Systems, Inc., the STB WIND/X video card may conflict
with the address of the COM4 serial port (2E8h). This article contains
an excerpt from the "WIND/X Video Card" user's manual that describes
the problem and workarounds.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following text is from page 1-4 of the STB "WIND/X Video Card"
user's manual:
<P>
<PRE>   The WIND/X graphics controller chip uses the hex port address 46E8 for
   one of its extended register sets. When only the first 8 bits of this
   16 bit address are decoded in any operation, the address appears as
   hex port address 2E8, which is a popular hex port address for a COM 4
   serial port. This may result in an address conflict and prevent COM 4
   from functioning or cause it to operate in an unpredictable manner.
   (e.g., Windows losing text, COM 4 locking up)

   If you have a COM 4, or any other device in your system that you
   suspect uses the 2E8h address, consult the device documentation for
   alternate address selection/configuration.

</PRE>For more information about the WIND/X video card, contact STB Systems.
