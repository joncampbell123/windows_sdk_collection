<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article discusses the Microsoft Windows version 3.1 WIN.INI
[Compatibility] section.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Compatibility bits are defined in the [Compatibility] section of the
WIN.INI file for the following applications:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Publisher
<LI>Microsoft Money
<LI>Microsoft Works
<LI>WordPerfect
<LI>Lotus Freelance
<LI>CC Mail
<LI>Microsoft Visual Basic
<LI>Ami Pro

<LI>Turbo Tax
<P>
</UL>When an application loads under Windows 3.1, KERNEL.EXE checks to see
if the application was compiled exclusively for Windows 3.1. If the
application was compiled for Windows 3.0, and will therefore run under
Windows 3.0 or 3.1, KERNEL.EXE checks the module name and determines
if any bits are defined for that name in the [Compatibility] section
of the WIN.INI file.
<P>
The following is a detailed explanation of compatibility bits. The
symbolic name is defined in WINDOWS.H. The problem, listed for each
application, will be fixed if the compatibility bit is defined. If
these switches are in the [Compatibility] section of the WIN.INI file
then these  problems will not occur. The Windows 3.1 Setup program
automatically inserts these  switches into the WIN.INI, regardless of
whether or not that application is on the machine.
<P>
The symbolic names are internal only, they are not in the WINDOWS.H
that ships with the Software Development Kit (SDK).
<P>
<P><h3>Bit: 1</h3>
 
Symbolic name: GACF_IGNORENODISCARD
Meaning: Ignore NODISCARD flag if passed to GlobalAlloc(). C 6.x
<PRE>         Runtime install library was allocating global memory
         improperly by incorrectly specifying the GMEM_NODISCARD bit.
</PRE>Apps:
<PRE>   Publisher
      WIN.INI Line: notshell=0x0001
      Problem: Setup for MS apps. does not work on 1M 286 machine.
   Money
      WIN.INI Line: notshell=0x0001
      Problem: Setup for MS apps. does not work on 1M 286 machine.
   Works
      WIN.INI Line: notshell=0x0001
      Problem: Setup for MS apps. does not work on 1M 286 machine.

</PRE><h3>Bit: 2</h3>
 
Symbolic name: GACF_FORCETEXTBAND
Meaning: Separate text band from graphics band. Forces separate band
<PRE>         for text, disallowing 3.1 optimization where Text and
         Graphics are printed in the same band. Word Perfect was
         assuming text had to go in second band.
</PRE>Apps:
<PRE>   WordPerfect
      WIN.INI Line: WPWINFIL=0x0006
      Problem: Can't print graphics in landscape mode. The
               compatibility switch doesn't completely fix the
               problem, just fixes it for certain memory
               configurations.
   Freelance
      WIN.INI Line: rem=0x8022
      Problem: Freelance couldn't print presentation (.pre) files.

</PRE><h3>Bit: 4</h3>
 
Symbolic name: GACF_ONELANDGRXBAND
Meaning: One graphics band only. Allows only one Landscape graphics
<PRE>         band. Take as much memory as possible for this band. What
         doesn't fit in that band doesn't print.
</PRE>Apps:
<PRE>   WordPerfect
      WIN.INI Line: WPWINFIL=0x0006
      Problem: Can't print graphics in landscape mode. The
               compatibility switch doesn't completely fix the
               problem, just fixes it for certain memory
               configurations.

</PRE><h3>Bit: 8</h3>
 
Symbolic name: GACF_IGNORETOPMOST
Meaning: Ignore topmost windows for GetWindow(HWND,GW_HWNDFIRST)
Apps:
<PRE>   CCMail
      WIN.INI Line: ccmail=0x0008
      Problem: CCMail would GP fault when running any Windows applet
               from CCMail because it assumed the applet it starts
               will be at the top of the window list when winexec
               returns. Because of the addition of TOPMOST windows in
               Win 3.1, this isn't the case.  The compatibility bit
               fixes this so GetWindow doesn't return a topmost
               window.

</PRE><h3>Bit: 10</h3>
 
Symbolic name: GACF_CALLTTDEVICE
Meaning: Set the DEVICE_FONTTYPE bit in the FontType for TT fonts
<PRE>         returned by EnumFonts().
</PRE>Apps:
<PRE>   Ami Pro
      WIN.INI Line: Amipro=0x0010
      Problem: Font mapping problems, described below.
   WordPerfect
      WIN.INI Line: win2wrs=0x1210
      Problem: WordPerfect was assuming TT fonts enumerated by the
               printer would have the device bit set. TT fonts are not
               device fonts, so this bit wasn't set. There were
               various font mapping problems, such as TNR appearing in
               Script or Symbol.

</PRE><h3>Bit: 20</h3>
 
Symbolic name: GACF_MULTIPLEBANDS
Meaning: Manually break graphics output into more than one band when
<PRE>         printing.
</PRE>Apps:
<PRE>   Freelance
      WIN.INI Line: Rem=0x08022
      Problem: Freelance wouldn't print graphics when there was enough
               memory and unidrv used only one band for printing. If
               the first band was the entire page, it didn't issue any
               graphics calls, thinking it was the text only band.
               This forces unidrv to use multiple bands.

</PRE><h3>Bit: 40</h3>
 
Symbolic name: GACF_ALWAYSSENDNCPAINT
Meaning: SetWindowPos() must send a WM_NCPAINT message to all
<PRE>         children, disallowing the 3.1 optimization where this message
         is only sent to windows that must be redrawn.
</PRE>Apps:
<PRE>   Pixie
      WIN.INI Line: pixie=0x0040
      Problem: File window overlaps the toolbox and doesn't repaint
               when a new file is opened.  Pixie used the receipt of
               WM_NCPAINT messages to determine that they may need to
               reposition themselves at the top of the list.  Win 3.0
               used to send the messages to windows even when they
               didn't need to be sent; in particular if the window was
               within the bounding rect of any update region involved
               in a window management operation.
   ObjectVision
      WIN.INI Line: Vision=0x0040
      Problem: Repaint problems with dialog boxes left on the screen
               after file.open or file.new operations.
   Cricket Presents
      WIN.INI Line: cp=0x0040
      Problem: Tool window is not available when opening the app.

</PRE><h3>Bit: 80</h3>
 
Symbolic name: GACF_EDITSETTEXTMUNGE
Meaning: Strings that are passed to Edit Controls by WM_SETTEXT are
<PRE>         forced to upper case. Just Write was expecting this
         behavior, which was a bug in 3.0.
</PRE>Apps:
<PRE>   Just Write
      WIN.INI Line: JW=0x42080
      Problem: Just Write wouldn't change the extension in the
               file.open dialog when opening a file of a different
               format. Just Write calls SetDlgItemText to set the
               default extension in edit controls during WM_INITDIALOG
               processing. SetDlgItemText ultimately calls text
               insert routine which had a bug in 3.0 where it
               converted the case of the text passed in dependent on
               edit control style. Thus, under 3.0, SetDlgItemText
               was (wrongly) modifying the string passed in. The app
               has worked around the bug in 3.0 and is now failing in
               3.1 since the bug has been fixed. The compatibility
               bit reverts to 3.0 behavior.

</PRE><h3>Bit: 100</h3>
 
Symbolic name: GACF_MOREEXTRAWNDWORDS
Meaning: Add 4 to the extra bytes (CBWNDEXTRA) in the window instance
<PRE>         and class instance structures. In Windows 3.0, even if you
         didn't allocate extra window/class words, you could still
         access them and corrupt Windows internally. In Windows 3.1,
         you are prevented from accessing extra words you didn't allocate
         so that apps won't corrupt windows. This switch forces
         extra words for all classes/windows created by the given
         application.
</PRE>Apps:
<PRE>   Compton's MM Ency
      WIN.INI Line: TME=0x0100
      Problem: Crashes choosing atlas. Caused by not initializing the
               WNDCLASS.cbWndExtra field.
   ExploreNet
      WIN.INI Line: netset2=0x0100
      Problem: Application error selecting update in "Input Form"
               window. Caused by the app specifying 0 extra bytes
               when creating the window class.
   Aporia 1.4
      WIN.INI Line: aporia=0x0100
      Problem: Aporia icons don't appear on the desktop. Hangs the
               system. App says it wants 1 extra byte in the
               RegisterClass, then does a SetWindowWord (2 bytes),
               then GetWindowLong (4 Bytes).

</PRE><h3>Bit: 200</h3>
 
Symbolic name: GACF_TTIGNORERASTERDUPE
Meaning: Don't enumerate Duplicate bit map fonts for TT fonts. Times
<PRE>         New Roman was displayed and printed as a vector font. We
         install bit map fonts for Arial and Times New Roman at sizes
         8,10 (EGA resolution). When we enumerate fonts for face names
         Arial and Times New Roman, we would enumerate the sizes
         available in the bit map fonts and one size for the
         corresponding true type font. This confused the font mapper
         in WordPerfect. It would somehow get confused into believing
         that a TNR font was available for only the two bit map sizes
         and map a request for a larger size to a Roman vector font.
</PRE>Apps:
<PRE>    Word Perfect
      WIN.INI Line: Win2wrs=0x01210
      Problem: Some fonts displayed as vector fonts. GDI will not
               enumerate raster fonts which have the same face or
               family name as a TT font if TT is enabled and the
               compatibility bit is set.
    Visual Basic
       WIN.INI Line: vb=0x0200
       Problem: Reports duplicate font sizes.

</PRE><h3>Bit: 800</h3>
 
Symbolic name: GACF_DELAYHWHNDSHAKECHK
Meaning: Don't check hardware handshaking on SetCommState(). Do not
<PRE>         check hardware handshaking (CTS and DSR) on SetCommState().
         (Reverts to 30 behavior.) Packrat could not Dial. It only
         checked for DSR, but this is not set until carrier detect. A
         bug existed in win30 where SetCommState never checked DSR and
         CTS. If a serial printer was off-line, data would be sent to
         the COM port anyway, causing lost data.
</PRE>Apps:
<PRE>    Packrat
      WIN.INI Line: packrat=0x0800
      Problem: Packrat didn't dial using modem on COM2.
    Microcourier
      WIN.INI Line: mcourier=0x800
      Problem: Couldn't connect to modem using COM2.

</PRE><h3>Bit: 1000</h3>
 
Symbolic name:  GACF_ENUMHELVNTMSRMN
Meaning: Enumerates TmsRmn and Helv. Some apps are broken because they
<PRE>         relied on 3.0 fonts Helv and Tms Rmn by name. Font
         Substitution covers much of these problems but we cannot
         legally enumerate Helv and Tms Rmn for future apps, so it was
         dropped. We still have the exact same fonts, but now under
         the names MS Sans Serif and MS Serif, and will enumerate them
         as Helv and Tms Rmn when this bit is set. (We are allowed to
         do this for backwards compatibility.)
</PRE>Apps:
<PRE>    Spinnaker +
      WIN.INI Line: plus=0x01000
      Problem: Text alignment and spacing problems in buttons and
               titles. Fix only works if Smallfonts come after serif
               and sans serif entries. Setup does this automatically.
    Milestones, etc.
      WIN.INI Line: milesv3=0x1000
      Problem: Text is unreadable when the app is started. App does
               its own font mapping and gets confused when it can't
               find Tms Rmn.
    Guide
      WIN.INI Line: guide=0x1000
      Problem: Text problems.
    Excel
      WIN.INI Line: Excel=0x1000
      Problem: Can't get past point where you have to enter a point
               size in the tutorial.
    WordPerfect
      WIN.INI Line: win2wwrs=0x1210
      Problem: Uses a vector font for TmsRmn.

</PRE><h3>Bit: 2000</h3>
 
Symbolic name:  GACF_ENUMTTNOTDEVICE
Meaning: Turns off DEVICE_FONTTYPE. Some apps fail to enumerate more
<PRE>         that one size of true type fonts because they interpret the
         DEVICE_FONTTYPE flag incorrectly. They assume the font must
         be device resident and disregard the case where the font is
         downloaded (as TT can be).  Therefore, when TT is correctly
         enumerated with the device bit set, the apps check the device
         capabilities to see if the printer can scale fonts. If the
         device cannot, the app assumes one size of for the current
         font. This problem is not seen on postscript printers which
         can download and scale fonts, nor on dot matrix printers
         which cannot download fonts. This Compatibility bit simply
         checks all the above conditions and selectively turns the
         DEVICE_FONTTYPE off.
</PRE>Apps:
<PRE>    Pagemaker 4.0
      WIN.INI Line: pm4=0x2000
      Problem: Not all point sizes listed for some printers.
    Designer 3.1
      WIN.INI Line: designer=0x2000
      Problem: Font size reverts to 6 point when selecting a TT font
               in the font dialog.
    Ascend 3.1
      WIN.INI Line: planner=0x2000
      Problem: TT fonts only allow one point size.
    MGXDraw 3.0
      WIN.INI Line: draw=0x2000
      Problem: Shows no font sizes for TT fonts.
    AccPack
      WIN.INI Line: winsim=0x2000
      Problem: Lists only one point size for TT fonts.
    Charisma
      WIN.INI Line: charisma=0x2000
      Problem: Not all point sizes listed for some printers.
    Persuasion
      WIN.INI Line: pr2=0x2000
      Problem: Lists only one point size for TT fonts.
    Just Write
      WIN.INI Line: jw=0x42080
      Problem: Lists only one or two point sizes for TT fonts.

</PRE><h3>Bit: 4000</h3>
 
Symbolic name:  GACF_SUBTRACTCLIPSIBS
Meaning:  This flag affects the way window invalidation works for non-
<PRE>          WS_CLIPSIBLINGS parent windows and their children (e.g.,
          dialog boxes and dialog controls). Normally, if two
          children of a non-WS_CLIPSIBLING parent overlap, and an area
          that contains both of those windows is invalidated (either
          by a call to InvalidateRect or through window
          rearrangement), both of the windows will get invalidated,
          even if one or both is WS_CLIPSIBLINGS. With
          GACF_SUBTRACTCLIPSIBS, any sibling window underneath a
          WS_CLIPSIBLINGS window will not be invalidated in the part
          of the window that is beneath the WS_CLIPSIBLINGS window.
          This situation arises most commonly when windows that are
          supposed to appear overlapped don't seem to overlap
          properly. Applications that implement drop down combo boxes
          as child windows of dialog boxes will exhibit this problem
          (e.g., Lotus Notes 2.1 drive drop downs). It's often hard to
          tell whether a drop down is implemented as a top-level
          window (e.g., the Windows system combo boxes) or as a child
          window -- if there seem to be overlapping problems, then
          GACF_SUBTRACTCLIPSIBS could be the solution.
</PRE>Apps:
<PRE>    Lotus Notes 2.0 &amp; 1
      WIN.INI Line: _BNOTES=0x24000
      Problem: Pull down drive list box pops down behind a list box
               which is already on the screen.
    Ingress
      WIN.INI Lines: wagl=0x4000
                     waglr=0x4000
      Problem: Overlapping child controls.

</PRE><h3>Bit: 8000</h3>
 
Symbolic name: GACF_FORCETTGRAPHICS
Meaning:
Apps:
<PRE>    Freelance
      WIN.INI Line: rem=0x8022
      Problem: Freelance wouldn't print TT unless print TT as graphics
               was selected.

</PRE><h3>Bit: 10000</h3>
 
Symbolic name: GACF_NOHRGN1
Meaning:  This bit affects applications that depend on a bug in the
<PRE>          3.0 GetUpdateRect() function. Under 3.0, GetUpdateRect
          would not always return the rectangle in logical DC
          coordinates: if the entire window was invalid, the rectangle
          was sometimes returned in window coordinates. This bug was
          fixed for 3.0 and 3.1 apps in Windows 3.1: coordinates are
          ALWAYS returned in logical coordinates. This bit re-
          introduces the bug in GetUpdateRect(), for those
          applications that depend on this behavior.
</PRE>Apps:
<PRE>    MSDraw
      WIN.INI Line: ED=0x00010000
      Problem: Canvas not redrawn properly opening specific MSDraw
               objects in Winword.

</PRE><h3>Bit: 20000</h3>
 
Symbolic name: GACF_NCCALCSIZEONMOVE
Meaning: 3.1 optimized WM_NCCALCSIZE if a window was just moving,
<PRE>         where 3.0 always sent it. This bit causes it to be sent
         always, as in 3.0.
</PRE>Apps:
<PRE>    Lotus Notes
      WIN.INI Line: _BNOTES=0x24000
      Problem: Navigator bar of window fails to redraw when the window
               is moved across the desktop.

</PRE><h3>Bit: 40000</h3>
 
Symbolic name: GACF_SENDMENUDBLCLK
Meaning: Passes double-clicks on a menu bar on to the app. With this
<PRE>         bit set, if the user double clicks on the menu bar when a
         menu is visible, we end processing of the menu and pass the
         double click message on to the application. This allows Just
         Write to detect double click on the system menu of a
         maximized MDI child.    The normal (and expected) behavior is
         for Windows to detect the double click on a sys menu of a
         maximized child and send the app a WM_SYSCOMMAND SC_CLOSE
         message which is what happens with a non-maximized MDI child
         window.
</PRE>Apps:
<PRE>    Just Write
      WIN.INI Line: JW=0x00042080
      Problem: Sub-editors (such as footer and header editors)
               couldn't be closed by double-clicking the system menu.

</PRE><h3>Bit: 80000</h3>
 
Symbolic name: GACF_30AVGWIDTH
Meaning: Changed the way we calculate avg width, this fixes it for
<PRE>         postscript. Scale all fonts by 7/8. This flag has been
         added for TurboTax for printing with pscript driver. Turbo
         Tax has hard coded average width it uses for selecting fonts.
         Since we changed the way we calculate avg width to match what
         is in TT, Turbo Tax is broken.
</PRE>Apps:
<PRE>    TurboTax
      WIN.INI Line: turbotax=0x80000
      Problem: 1040 tax forms wouldn't print correctly.

</PRE>If a third party vendor fixes the problems in their application, they
can recompile it so that it requires Windows 3.1; the  compatibility
bits will not be used. If the third party vedor wants their
application to run under Winodws 3.0 and 3.1, then they can change the
module name  or edit the WIN.INI.
