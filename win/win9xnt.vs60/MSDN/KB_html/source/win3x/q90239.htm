The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups, version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Windows for Workgroups file sharer, VSHARE.386, contains several
improvements over the MS-DOS file sharing utility, SHARE.EXE. These
improvements allow Windows for Workgroups to share files in a manner
similar to other network operating systems.
<P>
This article defines the file sharer (NOT the file server) and its
function in the operating system.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To be able to allow multiple users or programs concurrent access to
files and resources, an operating system must provide two basic
services:

<UL><LI>Arbitration of access requests

<LI>Updating of in-memory information that describes resources
<P>
</UL>Under MS-DOS, these two functions are handled by a component known as
the file "sharer." This component is separate from the MS-DOS kernel.
For MS-DOS versions 3.00 and later, this functionality is provided by
the terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) program, SHARE.EXE. Microsoft
Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 when running in Enhanced Mode,
replaces this with a new program, VSHARE.386.
<P>
VSHARE.386 is intended as a drop-in replacement for SHARE.EXE. Because
VSHARE is an Enhanced Mode virtual device driver (VxD), it has
features which improve file sharing under Enhanced Mode. Because it
was designed to work with Windows for Workgroups, VSHARE has features
to make it "friendlier" than SHARE.EXE, especially in the area of
access control. If SHARE.EXE is loaded and you start Windows for
Workgroups in Enhanced Mode, VSHARE takes over as file sharer until
you exit Windows. If you usually run Windows for Workgroups in
Enhanced Mode, you may not need to run SHARE.EXE at all (this can save
5K or more of conventional memory).
<P>
For each file open on the local computer, MS-DOS maintains a copy of
information about the file in memory. This includes both global
information that pertains to the file on disk, such as the file's
location on disk and its size, and local information that pertains to
each open instance of the file, such as the application's file
pointer. If a file is opened by multiple programs, and one application
changes a global attribute of the file, the sharer updates the
information for all file handles open on that file.
<P>
NOTE: The file handles that applications use to keep track of files
point to the copies of information about files maintained by MS-DOS in
memory.
<P>
If the real mode sharer SHARE.EXE is present without VSHARE, then all
information needed to open a file must be in memory at all times, even
when Enhanced Mode virtual memory is being used. (Virtual memory cannot
be swapped into or out of memory while MS-DOS is busy with a file
system request.) When you use VSHARE instead of (or in addition to)
SHARE, file open information for multiple Virtual Machines (VMs) does
not need to be in memory at the same time, only when each VM is
active. (MS-DOS applications run in separate VMs, and the Windows for
Workgroups file server runs its own separate VM.)
<P>
NOTE: This means you can use the Enhanced Mode PerVMFiles setting with
VSHARE, which means you can open more files using VSHARE than using
SHARE when running Windows for Workgroups in Enhanced Mode. See the
"Microsoft Windows Resource Kit," version 3.1, for a discussion of the
PerVMFiles setting.
<P>
Unlike SHARE (which uses global conventional memory), VSHARE uses
extended memory to store its copy of open file information. This
greatly increases the number of open files that Windows for
Workgroups, especially the server, can work with at once. Applications
which use file locking, such as Microsoft Mail, are less likely to run
out of file locks with VSHARE than with SHARE.
<P>
Because Windows for Workgroups is designed to function as a peer
server, the access control rules used by SHARE have been relaxed
somewhat in VSHARE. SHARE forbids the opening of "compatibility mode"
files while a "sharing" file is open, and vice versa. SHARE forbids
the opening of "compatibility mode" files from different machines or
VMs. Since a large percentage of MS-DOS applications and Windows
applications still use compatibility mode, SHARE prevents the Windows
for Workgroups server from operating effectively with several clients
connected to one server (the only way SHARE could operate in this
environment is if all the files on the server had read-only
attributes). This makes it inconvenient for network administrators to
set up directories of shared files on a network file server.
<P>
Using VSHARE, a compatibility mode read request can be active from
different machines and at the same time as most sharing requests. This
makes it easy to set up a directory of shared files under Windows for
Workgroups. The access rules are only relaxed for "safe" access
requests. If a process tries to open a file to write to it, for
example, the more restrictive set of rules is used.
<P>
This new file access behavior is known as "softcompat mode."  There
may be a reason to disable this, if there is a conflict with an older
application that has problems with the new access rules. This can be
done by placing "SOFTCOMPATMODE=FALSE" in the [386ENH] section of the
Windows SYSTEM.INI file. There are no applications known to require
this setting.
<P>
It is necessary to use a file sharer on any machine being used as a
file server or peer server. If an access violation happens on a
server and "Sharing Violation" error message appears, it interferes
with server performance. This is because MS-DOS is in a critical
section while the error message pop-up is visible. For this reason,
VSHARE disables sharing violation pop-up messages on MS-DOS versions
4.01 and greater. If this causes problems, you can add the
"ENABLESHARINGPOPUPS=TRUE" setting to the [386ENH] section of the
Windows SYSTEM.INI file. There are no applications known to require
this setting.
<P>
The file sharer can also be used to control access to MS-DOS device
drivers, if these are opened using MS-DOS file system calls. With
SHARE present, it is possible to get sharing violations on the NUL and
CON devices. VSHARE does not generate sharing violation error messages
when you access these devices. You can restore SHARE device sharing
functionality by adding "TRADITIONALDEVICESHARING=TRUE" to the
[386ENH] section of the Windows SYSTEM.INI file. There are no
applications known to require this setting.
<P>
Some applications are incompatible with file access checking. In
general, it is not recommended that you run such applications under
Windows for Workgroups, especially while the file server is running.
You can use the SYSTEM.INI switch "IGNORESHARINGVIOLATIONS=TRUE" to
diagnose such problems that occur when VSHARE is installed. This
switch turns off file access checking for all files and devices in the
system. Use this switch to diagnose problems only; you should not use
it to correct problems. It usually causes more problems than it
solves. If any application refuses to run with SHARE or VSHARE
installed, contact the application vendor for assistance.
<P>
Sometimes problems occur where a "network aware" version of an
application does not keep application documents open. These
applications attempt to arbitrate document access by using a semaphore
or marker in the document file or on disk. This technique usually
fails in a multi-user network environment due to synchronization
problems. In order to write an application properly to handle multi-
user or multi-application access to data files, the first instance of
the application accessing any data file should KEEP THE FILE OPEN to
allow the file sharer and MS-DOS to communicate to subsequent
applications that the file is in use. This suggestion applies equally
to SHARE and VSHARE. There is no way that the file sharer can know
that a file is "busy" unless it is actually kept open by the
application.
<P>
<P><h3>Troubleshooting Tip</h3>
 
<P>
If problems with file sharing are suspected, remember that the file
sharer responsible for a specific file is the sharer running on the
machine where the file is physically located. If file sharing problems
occur while you access a file on a network drive, modifying the VSHARE
settings on the local machine will not help.
