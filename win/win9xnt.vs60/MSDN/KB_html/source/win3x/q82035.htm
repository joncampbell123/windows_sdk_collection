<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Popup Window is a ROM-based utility on Toshiba laptops that includes
several battery-saving functions. This utility does not work properly
with Microsoft Windows version 3.0 running in 386 enhanced mode.
<P>
To work around this problem, obtain the WINTOSH.ZIP shareware utility
program from the Toshiba BBS. This utility is designed to replace
Popup Window while running 386 enhanced mode Windows.
<P>
This shareware utility program is also available on CompuServe under
the name WINTSH.ZIP.
<P>
NOTE: This shareware utility was NOT created by Toshiba and is updated
by its author on an ongoing basis.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
According to Toshiba Technical Support, the battery-saving software
cannot make the appropriate calls to the ROM BIOS while Windows is
operating in 386 enhanced mode.
<P>
Toshiba reports that the Popup Window utility works properly in the real
and standard modes of Windows.
<P>
For more information on this problem, contact Toshiba PC Product
Support.
