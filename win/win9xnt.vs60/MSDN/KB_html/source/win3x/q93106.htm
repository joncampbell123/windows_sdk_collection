WINDOWS
kbnetwork kberrmsg kbprb
<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.1, 3.11
<LI>Microsoft WinLogin version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you try to install WinLogin version 1.0 on a Microsoft LAN Manager
version 2.1 network without an updated LAN Manager driver file, the
following error message is displayed:
<P>
<PRE>   WinLogin Client Setup Error

   WinLogin Client Setup could not access the network path where this
   machine's configuration files are to be stored.

   Please ensure this machine has access to the remote network resource
   and retry.

</PRE>Once you install the updated driver file, you may also need to change
an entry in your WIN.INI file. This article explains how to do this.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The size and date of the updated driver file is:
<P>
<PRE>   LANMAN21.DRV      227,104        06/18/92

</PRE>This driver is available on the MSDL BBS at (425) 936-6735 in the LAN
Manager area as LANMAN21.EXE.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Install LANMAN21.DRV</h3>
 
<P>
When you update the LAN Manager driver file, you need to locate the
existing file and delete multiple copies, install the updated version
of the file, and change an entry in your WIN.INI file. Each of these
procedures is described below.
<P>
To locate and delete any multiple copies of LANMAN21.DRV:

<OL><P><LI>Use File Manager to check for copies of LANMAN21.DRV.

<P><LI>Delete all but one copy of the file. This copy should be located in
   either the LANMAN.DOS\NETPROG or the WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory.
<P>
</OL>To install the updated version:

<OL><P><LI>Quit Windows.

<P><LI>Rename the older copy of LANMAN21.DRV. For example, if the file is
   located in the LANMAN.DOS\NETPROG directory, use the following
   command:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ren c:\lanman.dos\netprog\lanman21.drv *.21
</PRE>
<P><LI>Place the disk that contains the updated driver file in your floppy
   disk drive.

<P><LI>Copy the new LANMAN21.DRV into the desired directory. For example,
   to copy it from a disk in drive A to the LANMAN.DOS\NETPROG directory
   on drive C, use the following command:
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy a:\lanman21.drv c:\lanman.dos\netprog
</PRE><P>
</OL>To change the entry in your WIN.INI file:

<OL><P><LI>Open the WIN.INI file (for example, by using SYSEDIT).

<P><LI>Search for the [network] section.

<P><LI>Search for and delete the following entry:
<P>
<P><PRE>      DefaultDialogs=1
</PRE><P>
   Note: If you do not find this entry, you don't need to modify the
   WIN.INI file.

<P><LI>Save the modified WIN.INI file.

<P><LI>Restart the computer and restart Windows.
<P>
</OL><h3>Features of the Updated LANMAN21.DRV</h3>
 

<UL><LI>Updated File File Manager dialog box.

<LI>Shows only one dialog box for both Net Connections and Net
   Disconnections. There use to be two separate dialog boxes.

<LI>Enables you to make multiple disconnections without having to leave
   the dialog box. Previously you were ejected from the dialog box after
   each disconnection.

<LI>Enables you to view your Previous Connections in a drop-down list
   box in the Net Connections dialog box.

<LI>Enables you to specify whether a network connection should be made
   persistent. (If a connection is designated as persistent, Windows 3.1
   restores the connection each time you log in.)
