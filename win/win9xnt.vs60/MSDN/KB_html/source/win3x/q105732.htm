The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 differs from previous
versions of Windows (including Windows for Workgroups 3.1) with respect to
the requirements for, and the limitations of, network server-based shared
installations (that is, SETUP /A and SETUP /N installations).
<P>
This article is intended to provide system administrators with some
guidelines for performing such installations.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you set up a server-based shared installation of Windows for
Workgroups 3.11, be aware of the following:

<UL><LI>In the Microsoft LAN Manager and Windows NT environment (or any
   network requiring the installation of the real-mode Windows for
   Workgroups 3.11 redirector prior to accessing the server with the
   shared, SETUP /A, directory), Windows for Workgroups 3.11 nodes have
   client functionality only.
<P>
   NOTE: Because Novell NetWare requires its own real-mode redirector
   (giving the node access to the shared directory before loading Windows
   for Workgroups and its peer-to-peer network components), this
   limitation may not exist in integrated Windows for Workgroups
   3.11/NetWare environments.

<LI>When running SETUP /N to a workstation from a Novell server, the
   Windows for Workgroups Setup program requires that Novell's Windows
   support files exist in the shared directory on the server (that is,
   the directory created with SETUP /A). The following files need to be
   copied to the shared Windows directory prior to running SETUP /N:
<P>
<P><PRE>      NETWARE.DRV
      NETWARE.HLP
      NWPOPUP.EXE
      VNETWARE.386
      VIPX.386
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: Other third-party networks may present the same restrictions;
   refer to your network product documentation or vendor for more
   information.
<P>
</UL>Novell NetWare is manufactured by Novell, a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this
product's performance or reliability.
