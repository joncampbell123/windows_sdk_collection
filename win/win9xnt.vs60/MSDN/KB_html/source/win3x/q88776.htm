<P><h3>Sigma Models and Specific Model Issues</h3>
 
<P>
LaserView Monochrome or LaserView Classic
<P>
This monitor supports 1600 x 1200 pixel resolution. The Windows 3.1
drivers for this card may display the Windows 3.0 logo when Windows is
started. If this is a problem, contact Sigma for updated drivers that
correct this problem.
<P>
This card uses two upper memory areas (UMA) B000-BFFF and D000-DFFF.
The base I/O address for this card is located at 249 hexadecimal.
<P>
PageView and SilverView Monochrome, and VGA Legend
<P>
Microsoft has no information about PageView Monochrome and SilverView
Monochrome having any problems with Windows. However, when running
Windows 3.1 in enhanced mode with the VGA Legend, black and white
rectangles may appear on the screen. (Alternative symptoms are brown
and tan colored bands obscuring all Windows features.)
<P>
To resolve this problem, insert the following line in the [386enh]
section of the SYSTEM.INI:
<P>
<PRE>   sysvmin2ndbank=false

</PRE>Sigma/H
<P>
This is an earlier Sigma EGA or VGA card, which is not compatible with
Windows. Contact Sigma and have your card upgraded to the Sigma
Legend.
<P>
NOTE: Many Sigma cards come in both Micro channel (MCA) and ISA bus
interfaces. If you are using the MCA version of the card, make sure
you are using the PS/2 drivers, instead of the Windows 3.0 drivers.
<P>
<P><h3>Driver Installation</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Exit Windows, and change your directory to C:\WINDOWS.

<P><LI>Type "setup" (without any quotation marks) and press ENTER.

<P><LI>From the hardware options screen, choose Display.

<P><LI>Choose Other, and insert the Sigma driver disk.
<P>
</OL>The Sigma Designs products included here are manufactured by a vendor
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise,
regarding these products' performance or reliability.
