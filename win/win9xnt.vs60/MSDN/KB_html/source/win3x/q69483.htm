<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
According to Future Domain, SMARTDrive may be run with Future Domain's
LDRIVE.SYS driver for its SCSI drive without risk of data loss if
LDRIVE.SYS is loaded after SMARTDrive in the CONFIG.SYS file.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
LDRIVE.SYS is a third-party disk partitioning driver that addresses
partitions larger than 32 MB. Microsoft generally recommends that
SMARTDrive not be used when using third-party disk partitioning
drivers that create a nonstandard MS-DOS environment. However, for
bus mastering disk controllers such as SCSI drives, SMARTDrive
provides double buffering of data that is important for Windows
operation.
<P>
Future Domain has tested this configuration extensively and supports
running both these drivers concurrently, as long as the device line
for SMARTDrive comes before LDRIVE.SYS in the CONFIG.SYS file. An
alternative is to reformat and partition the hard drive with the MS-DOS
FDISK program if this configuration is incompatible.
<P>
