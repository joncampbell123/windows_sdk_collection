The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
You may receive a printing error message when you try to print from a
Windows application under Windows 3.0 or 3.0a. For example, you may receive
the following error message in the Write:
<P>
<PRE>   Could not print page - Error:-1.

</PRE>This problem does not occur with later versions of Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This may be caused by the file DOSSHELL.SWP being in the directory pointed
to by the SET TEMP= setting in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file. The DOSSHELL.SWP file
is created in this directory if the following statements are both true:

<UL><LI>DOSSHELL has been executed and then shelled out by pressing
   SHIFT+F9.

<LI>Multiple instances of the DOSSHELL program have been entered and
   are running.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
If multiple instances of DOSSHELL are started while Windows is running, use
the following procedure to close the multiple instances of DOSSHELL to
remove the DOSSHELL.SWP file from the temporary directory:

<OL><P><LI>Close Windows.

<P><LI>At the command prompt, type
<P>
<P><PRE>      exit
</PRE><P>
   to go into the DOSSHELL program.

<P><LI>Close the DOSSHELL by pressing ALT+F to open the File menu, and
   press X to exit.

<P><LI>Repeat steps 2 and 3 above until you do not go into the DOSSHELL
   program when you type:
<P>
<P><PRE>      exit
</PRE><P>
</OL>This should remove the DOSSHELL.SWP file from the temporary directory.
<P>
NOTE: If the computer has been turned off while the DOSSHELL.SWP file
was in the temporary directory, the above procedure may not remove the
file.
<P>
The DOSSHELL.SWP file is created with a read-only attribute. The file can
not be deleted until you clear the read-only attribute. The following
command can be used to clear the read-only attribute of the file so that it
can be deleted:
<P>
<PRE>   Attrib -r dosshell.swp
</PRE>
