<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If you are running Windows, and are connected to a bridged Novell network,
leaving the machine idle may result in the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Error reading from network

</PRE>At this point the machine will probably be locked up, and you will have to
reboot the computer. If you encounter this error message outside of
Windows, you will likely be able to choose Abort from the error message
options, save your work, and reconnect to the network. This is not possible
when the network disconnects when Windows 3.1 is running.
<P>
This problem is likely caused by using Watchdog, provided with Novell
NetWare version 3.11.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If you are using a bridged network and leave the system inactive for longer
than 15 to 20 minutes, Watchdog will disconnect the bridge. When this
happens, Windows 3.1 will hang.
<P>
There is no way to turn watchdog off. The only solution is to set all of
Watchdogs time-out settings to their maximum. This should allow the machine
to sit idle for 15 hours before disconnecting from the network.
<P>
For more information on configuring Watchdog, please contact Novell.
<P>
The Watchdog product included here is manufactured by a vendor independent
of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this
product's performance or reliability.
