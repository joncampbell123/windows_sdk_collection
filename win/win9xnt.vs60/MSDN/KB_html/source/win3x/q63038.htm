The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Testing by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) has shown Pathworks
version 4.0 and Microsoft Windows 3.0 (and Windows-based applications)
to be compatible.
<P>
NOTE: This information is not valid for later versions of  Microsoft
Windows. Later versions of Windows ship with drivers for the Pathworks
network (version 4.0 and 4.1) provided by DEC.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
DEC produces a mainframe communication package called PCSA that allows
PCs to access mainframes. The PCSA network is composed of two different
servers, a disk server and a file server. This network is not a supported
network and Microsoft does not make any claims as to its compatibility.
<P>
Windows cannot be installed on the PCSA Disk Server because Windows
must be able to create, read, and write to temporary files to swap its
applications. Because DEC's PCSA Disk Server is a removable media
device, Windows cannot install.
<P>
Supported networks include the following:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Networks (or 100-percent compatible)
<LI>Microsoft LAN Manager 1.00
<LI>Microsoft LAN Manager 2.00
<LI>3Com 3+Share
<LI>3Com 3+Open LAN Manager
<LI>Banyan Vines 4.0
<LI>Novell NetWare 2.1 or later
<LI>Novell NetWare 386
<P>
</UL>Users of DEC PCSA versions earlier than 4.0 should consider investigating
the upgrade to the later version because this later version is more
compatible with Windows 3.0.
<P>
PCSA (now called Pathworks) is DEC's client software loosely based on
the LAN Manager redirector that allows DOS and OS/2 machines to access
DECnet. DECnet is DEC's enterprise network that includes SNA connectivity
and integration of Macintosh machines (also a Pathworks product; although
no Microsoft software is involved.)
<P>
The products included here are manufactured by vendors independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these
products' performance or reliability.
