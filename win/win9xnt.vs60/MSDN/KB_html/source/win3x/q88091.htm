The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If Windows starts from the Windows directory but not from another
directory, such as the root directory, then one or more of the
following conditions may exist:

<UL><LI>There are multiple WIN.COM files. For example, WIN.COM file has been
   copied to the root directory of the boot drive.
<LI>A batch file is being used to start Windows.
<LI>There is a pathing problem.
<LI>Incompatible files are present in the current directory or path.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Make sure you are starting Windows by typing "WIN" (without the
quotation marks) instead of using a batch file to start Windows.
<P>
Edit the AUTOEXEC.BAT file and make WINDOWS the first directory in
your PATH= statement. This usually resolves any pathing problems.
<P>
Windows requires that certain file are in the same directory as the
WIN.COM file. To search for multiple WIN.COM files or a batch file
that is attempting to start Windows from another directory:

<OL><P><LI>Run File Manager.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Search.

<P><LI>In the Search For box, type "WIN.COM" (without the quotation marks)
   to search for multiple WIN.COM files or "WIN.BAT" to search for a
   batch file that might start Windows.

<P><LI>Make sure the Start From text box contains C:\ and that the Search
   All Subdirectories check box is selected.
<P>
</OL>If you are using MS-DOS 5.0 or later, you can search for these files using
the DIR command.

<OL><P><LI>Change to the root directory by typing the following at the MS-DOS
   command prompt:
<P>
<P><PRE>      cd \
</PRE>
<P><LI>Type the following command to check for duplicate WIN.COM files:
<P>
<P><PRE>      dir win.com /s
</PRE>
<P><LI>Type the following command to check for a batch file called
   WIN.BAT:
<P>
<P><PRE>      dir win.bat /s
</PRE><P>
</OL>These commands will list all WIN.COM and WIN.BAT files on the current
hard drive. If you have more than one WIN.COM file, delete all the
extra ones, leaving just one WIN.COM file on the hard drive in the
WINDOWS directory.
<P>
If you find a WIN.BAT file, rename it to something else, such as
GOWIN.BAT. Rename the file WINSTART.BAT because Windows treats this as
a special file to be read after starting Windows.
<P>
If you have tried all of the above, and Windows will start from the
WINDOWS directory, but it won't start from another directory such as
the root directory, you probably have incompatible device drivers in
the directory from which Windows will not start. To correct this
problem, compare a directory listing of the Windows directory with the
directory from which Windows will not start, and look for duplicate
files (or device drivers) such as MOUSE.DRV, LMOUSE.DRV, VGA.DRV,
VGA.3GR, and so on.
