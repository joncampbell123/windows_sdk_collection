The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you use Chips &amp; Technologies PEAK/DM BIOS version 1.1, you may receive
Unrecoverable Application Error (UAE) or Internal Stack Overflow error
messages while Microsoft Windows version 3.0 is running in enhanced mode.
<P>
These errors may occur while running a Windows-based application such as
Microsoft Excel 3.0 in enhanced mode.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem is caused by an outdated BIOS version.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
You need to upgrade the BIOS to version 1.3 (dated March 21, 1991) or
later. For an update to this BIOS, contact Chips and Technologies, Inc.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Chips &amp; Technologies, Inc. is a supplier of motherboards to many computer
manufacturers. These motherboards use the PEAK/DM BIOS, which is also
manufactured by Chips &amp; Technologies, Inc.
<P>
<P><h3>Details of PEAK/DM BIOS Version 1.3</h3>
 
<P>
Version 1.3 of the BIOS provides the following improvements:

<OL><P><LI>Reduced the time-out delay that occurs on 386 and 486 systems when
    waiting for the printer line to no longer be busy. This makes the time-
    out on printer failure more consistent with the IBM PC/AT.

<P><LI>Improved the detection of EGA/VGA BIOS, even if both exist and are
    addressed at C0000H; the following is the precedence that is given
    to the multiple video BIOS in one system:
<P>
    a. External BIOS at C0000H (signature is AA55H)
    b. Internal BIOS at E0000H (signature is 6699H)
    c. Internal BIOS at C0000H (signature is AA55H)

<P><LI>Changed the BIOS serial interface (INT 14H) so that it no longer
    does range checking on the COM port index.

<P><LI>Corrected a problem with the conversion of 286 LOADALL instruction
    data to 386 LOADALL instruction data, which caused AUTOCAD for DOS
    version 10 to fail when running in MS-DOS mode under OS/2 version
    1.1.

<P><LI>Improved the moving of C000 segment ROM data to shadow RAM when the
    ROM is on the motherboard; now the whole 64K segment, rather than
    just the video BIOS, is scanned for valid adapter ROMs to be copied
    to shadow RAM.

<P><LI>Reduced the time-out delay on the RTC test from 3-4 seconds down to
    1.5-2.0 seconds.

<P><LI>Changed the cache enable field name in the ADVANCED FEATURE CONTROL
    page of the setup from "Cache Operation" to "Cache Initialization"
    to differentiate it from the CHIPset REGISTER CONTROL page of the
    setup.

<P><LI>Changed the description of the cache enable bit on the CHIPset
    REGISTER CONTROL page to indicate that enabling this bit will not
    provide any pre-enable initialization of the cache, and thus may
    cause system failure.

<P><LI>Corrected a problem with the time display in Setup when the RTC
    time values are corrupted; now, if the values are invalid or not in
    BCD format, the time is reset to midnight.

<P><LI>Corrected a problem with the adapter ROM scan so that the scan
    still checks every 2K, even if it finds an adapter ROM smaller
    than 2K.

<P><LI>Changed the fixed disk interface (INT 13H) so that the fixed disk
    drive is selected early enough to allow certain drives to become
    ready, even when the CPU is running at very high speeds (such as
    33 MHz or higher).

<P><LI>Corrected some problems in the handling and display of drive data
    for the user-defined fixed disk drives.

<P><LI>Changed the speed-switching part of the BIOS to support the newest
    version for the CHIPS Keyboard controller (version 2.14), which
    allows several pins to be used for input from a turbo switch
    (which the keyboard controller will monitor), and any of several
    pins to be used for changing the state of a turbo LED.

<P><LI>Changed the floppy disk interface (INT 13H, INT 40H) so that the
    disk change line is ignored if the drive is a 360K drive.
