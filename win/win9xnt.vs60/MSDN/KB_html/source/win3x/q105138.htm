The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In version 3.11 of Microsoft Windows for Workgroups, there are
additional menu items not supplied in the retail package of Microsoft
Mail for PC Networks.
<P>
Under the Mail Options menu, there is a section titled "Optimize Local
Mail File." The following new choices are available:
<P>
<PRE>   DoubleSpace
   Highest Security

</PRE>These two choices are specific to version 3.11 of Microsoft Windows
for Workgroups Mail and are only available when running with MS-DOS
version 6.0 or later.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
DoubleSpace is considered to have less encryption (resulting in less
security) but better performance (that is, increased speed) than the
Highest Security option. DoubleSpace is available with MS-DOS version
6.0 or later only.
<P>
The Highest Security option uses the same Mail message file (.MMF)
encryption algorithm that Microsoft Mail for PC Network uses. Highest
Security is not as fast as DoubleSpace because time is used to encrypt
and decrypt the .MMF file.
<P>
The DoubleSpace encryption is built into DoubleSpace itself. A file
cannot be copied from a DoubleSpace drive, imported to a different
computer, and easily read. Since the file allocation table (FAT)
system is cluster-based, DoubleSpace uses its own FAT (which is called
the Microsoft DoubleSpace FAT [MDFAT]) to achieve sector allocation.
This encryption option is fast, however, it is not as secure as the
encryption algorithm used in the Highest Security setting.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Additional information about DoubleSpace can be found on pages 118-136
in the MS-DOS "User's Guide" and in Chapter 3 of the MS-DOS "Technical
Reference Manual."
