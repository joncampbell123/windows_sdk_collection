The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If you have Microsoft Windows 3.0 configured for a Microsoft LAN Manager
2.0 enhanced (or 100-percent-compatible) network, and the network is
currently loaded, you can receive pop-up messages from a server or from
other users on the network. These messages are displayed in a Windows
pop-up panel titled "WinPopup," whose associated executable is
WINPOPUP.EXE. This executable is typically on the LOAD= line in the
WIN.INI file.
<P>
You cannot receive pop-up messages if you are currently running an MS-DOS
application and any of the following conditions is true:

<UL><LI>You are running Windows in real mode.

<LI>You are running Windows in standard mode.

<LI>You are running the MS-DOS application with full-screen and exclusive
   display and tasking options settings in Windows enhanced mode.
<P>
</UL>You can receive pop-up messages while running the MS-DOS application in
Windows enhanced mode if the application is running in a window and/or the
exclusive tasking option for the application is unchecked.
<P>
NOTE: If you are running a full-screen, nonexclusive MS-DOS application in
Windows enhanced mode and you receive a pop-up message, the MS-DOS
application will minimize to allow the pop-up message to be displayed.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Messenger service receives the messages and passes them to NetPopup.
However, if NetPopup detects that Windows is running, then it simply queues
the messages (to prevent the messages from crashing Windows). WinPopup
polls NetPopup every three seconds or so to determine if there are any
messages. However, because WinPopup is running in the background,if you are
running in real or standard mode or are running a full-screen exclusive
MS-DOS session in enhanced mode, WinPopup is not able to respond. The
message(s) will be displayed once you switch back to Windows or quit the
MS-DOS application.
<P>
NOTE: In IBM's DOS LAN Requester, NETPOPUP.EXE is called MSGPOPUP.EXE. Also
MSGPOPUP.EXE is loaded into memory when the /POP parameter is included in
the NET START command.
