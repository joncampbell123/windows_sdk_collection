The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article contains a general listing of Artisoft LANtastic cards and
their use with Windows for Workgroups.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Artisoft's 2Mbps Card (also known as the AEX Card, and most often packaged
with the LANtastic Starter Kit) DO NOT work with Windows for Workgroups.
These are proprietary cards that are designed with a NetBIOS chip on the
card itself. This design does not work with a network driver interface
specification (NDIS) compliant driver.
<P>
The following cards have NDIS drivers supplied with Windows for Workgroups
and are supported:

<UL><LI>AE-1 Ethernet Card
<LI>AE-2 Ethernet Card
<LI>AE-3 Ethernet Card
<LI>Noderunner 2000
<P>
</UL>All the above network cards can emulate an NE1000. The AE-2 and AE-3 can
also be configured to emulate an NE2000. However, emulation for the AE-2
and AE-3 is configured through setting physical jumpers on the network
card. Specific instructions for jumper settings can be found in Artisoft's
documentation.
<P>
Artisoft's Noderunner 2000 card is configurable through the NRCONFIG.EXE
program. This adapter works with the NE2000-compatible driver in Windows
for Workgroups version 3.11.
