The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The Windows-based Banyan VINES Pop-Up application MESSAGES.EXE does
not work correctly with Windows for Workgroups.
<P>
The Banyan VINES network operating system versions 4.11 and higher
provides a message service that can send and receive messages from
within Windows using the MESSAGES.EXE program. When you use Windows
for Workgroups with the VINES connectivity drivers, you hear a sound
when a message is received but the MESSAGES.EXE program continues to
show that no messages have been received.
<P>
NOTE: This problem may also affect other messenger-based VINES
applications.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To view the messages, use the MS-DOS-based LASTMSG.EXE program, which
correctly shows all messages received since you logged in.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Banyan Systems has confirmed this to be a problem with its Windows
for Workgroups drivers and can be contacted for further information.
<P>
Banyan VINES is manufactured by Banyan Systems, a vendor independent
of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding
this product's performance or reliability.
