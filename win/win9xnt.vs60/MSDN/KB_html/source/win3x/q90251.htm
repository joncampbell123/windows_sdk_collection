<P>
In Hearts, when the cards are dealt, the positions of the cards that
are passed and played can be discerned by other players. Dots appear
adjacent to the cards to be passed, and played cards are realistically
removed from players' hands.
<P>
As your cards are always automatically sorted, it seems that you could
predict roughly which cards other players have passed and played.
However, this is not true. The positions that you see represent the
other players' hands before the cards were sorted. Although the positioning
is accurate for all players, it has nothing to do with the automatic
sorting, giving you no real clues as to the cards your opponents are
holding.
