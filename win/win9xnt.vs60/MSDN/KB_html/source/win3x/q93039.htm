The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Some token ring network interface cards (NICs) can use a "local addressing"
feature with Windows for Workgroups. This feature allows the network card's
internal network address to be bypassed and defined manually.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The local address is defined by placing the following line in the
network card section of the PROTOCOL.INI file:
<P>
<PRE>   [MS$IBMTR1]            (Using the IBM Token Ring card)
   Netaddress="&lt;value&gt;"   (The quotation marks are required)

</PRE>The value for the Netaddress= setting must be stated as a series of 12
hexadecimal digits within quotation marks, with no spaces separating
the digits. There is no default for the Netaddress= setting.
<P>
The address must be within the range 400000000000 through
40007FFFFFFF; however, for strict IBM compatibility, use only decimal
digits (0-9), as in "400001020304."
<P>
<P><h3>Incorrectly Entered Netaddress Values</h3>
 
<P>
If the Netaddress= value is incorrectly entered (without quotation
marks, for example), one of the following error messages may be
displayed during startup:
<P>
While loading PROTMAN.DOS:
<P>
<PRE>   PRO0006E: Integer overflow in PROTOCOL.INI parameter
   Unable to open Protocol Manager

</PRE>While loading the netcard driver:
<P>
<PRE>   MAC0001: Initialization Failure
   Press any key to continue...

</PRE>While executing NET USE in AUTOEXEC.BAT:
<P>
<PRE>   Error 3653: The protocol manager could not be found.

</PRE>To correct these errors, verify that there are 12 digits, that they
are within quotation marks, and that there are no spaces between
entries.
<P>
<P><h3>Computers Using the Same Netaddress</h3>
 
<P>
You may also experience one of the following problems if there are
duplicate computers on the network using the same Netaddress= value:

<UL><LI>Computers cannot connect to the network. (This problem occurs when
   the first computer to enter the ring causes another machine that is
   attempting to use the same Netaddress= value to fail.)

<LI>Lost connection to the ring when starting Windows for Workgroups or
   starting the real mode redirector.

<LI>Inability to browse or connect to other computers within Windows for
   Workgroups.
<P>
</UL>No error messages are displayed if you start a machine that is attempting
to use a network address that is already in use, but network access
problems, as described above, do occur.
<P>
To troubleshoot a possible network address conflict, remove the Netaddress=
line in the PROTOCOL.INI by placing a semicolon at the beginning of that
line. If problems persist, there is may be some other conflict, such as
IRQ, I/O address, or device driver.
<P>
The following token ring network cards support local addressing with
Windows for Workgroups:
