The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In Windows for Workgroups, the Windows Clipboard Viewer was completely
rebuilt as ClipBook Viewer, which includes capabilities to transfer
information over the network (called network dynamic data exchange [DDE]).
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To test network DDE, both machines should be running the same video
driver, such as VGA (16 colors), which shipped with Windows for
Workgroups.
<P>
Network DDE works like object-linking-and-embedding (OLE) over a network.
There are several logical steps to troubleshoot a network DDE problem:

<OL><P><LI>Make sure that the machines can communicate with each other. To
   test this, try to copy a file from one machine to another.
   Remember that a Windows for Workgroups machine needs to be in
   enhanced mode and have 4 megabytes (MB) of memory to have server
   functionality.

<P><LI>To make sure that the problem is not application-related, do a
   network DDE link using Paintbrush and Write. The steps are as
   follows:
<P>
   a. Open a bitmap in Paintbrush and copy it to the Clipboard.
<P>
   b. Open ClipBook. From the Edit menu, choose Paste. This brings
<P><PRE>      up a dialog box that asks for a Page (Share) Name.
</PRE><P>
   c. Type "test" (without the quotation marks) as the Page Name and
<P><PRE>      choose OK. (Make sure the Share Item Now box is selected.)
</PRE><P>
   d. When the next dialog box comes up, choose Start Application
<P><PRE>      On Connect.
</PRE><P>
   e. From the Client machine, open ClipBook. From the File menu,
<P><PRE>      choose Connect.
</PRE><P>
   f. Select the server name from the list, then select the "test"
<P><PRE>      file.
</PRE><P>
   g. From the Edit menu, choose Copy.
<P>
   h. Start Write. From the Edit menu, choose Paste Link. This should
<P><PRE>      create a Network DDE link from Paintbrush on the server machine
      to Write on the client machine.
</PRE><P>
   i. Test the link by drawing in Paintbrush on the server and see
<P><PRE>      if Write is updated on the client.
</PRE><P>
</OL>If Write isn't updated, there is a problem with Network DDE. If the
above steps work, the problem is in one or both of the applications
that were having the original problem.
<P>
Each of the applications can be tested with Write or Paintbrush to
determine which application is at fault. Some applications may have to
be upgraded to work properly with Network DDE. Check with the
application vendor for more information on a specific application.
