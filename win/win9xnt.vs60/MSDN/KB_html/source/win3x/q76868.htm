<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
MIDI files authored using the high-end data alone do not produce
sound on a low-end MIDI device. For example, if a MIDI file was
created that used only channels 2 through 5, a low-end device would
not receive the MIDI data. Because there is no low-end version of the
data, nothing is sent through the mapper to the low-end (for example,
AdLib) device.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The 16 MIDI channels are organized as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   Channel   Use
   -------   ---
      1      high-end (highest priority)
      2      high-end
      3      high-end
      4      high-end
      5      high-end
      6      high-end
      7      high-end
      8      high-end
      9      high-end (lowest priority)
     10      high-end percussive
     11      RESERVED
     12      RESERVED
     13      low-end (highest priority)
     14      low-end
     15      low-end (lowest priority)
     16      low-end percussive

</PRE>MIDI data is authored concurrently, with high-end and low-end data. The
mapper masks off data that is inappropriate for the device on which
the sound is played. (The mapper also transforms the sound according
to the maps.)
<P>
In the case above, to hear the MIDI data, it would be necessary to
create a map that passes the data on channels 2 through 5 to the
AdLib, or to modify the file to use channels 13 through 16.
