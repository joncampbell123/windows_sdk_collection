<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you have more than one macro with the same key sequence, and one of
the macros was created in the Recorder program packaged with Microsoft
Windows version 3.0, Windows replays the Recorder-created macro instead of
a macro created from other Windows-based applications.
<P>
For example, if you write a macro in Microsoft Excel that is activated
by the CTRL+A key sequence, and you also have a macro created for the
Recorder application that uses CTRL+A, the Recorder macro is activated
when you press CTRL+A. This occurs if Recorder is running in a window
or as an icon.
<P>
If the Recorder macro is set to play back into Any Application, the
macro keystrokes are sent to the application that is running. If the
Recorder macro is set to play back into Same Application, the Recorder
attempts to switch control to the application where the macro was
recorded and then play back into THAT application. If the application
is not running, Recorder terminates with an error message.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To change Recorder's playback, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>From the Options menu, choose Preferences.

<P><LI>The Default Preferences dialog box appears. Under Playback To,
   select Any Application or Same Application.
