<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article discusses conditions that may cause Windows to hang when
a Banyan Vines 3270 program is run. The following topics are included:

<UL><LI>NEWREV 1W patch causes Windows to hang
<LI>Banyan Vines 3270/RA 3270 hangs because of login script
<LI>Windows 3.0 and 3270 with Banyan Mail
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>NEWREV 1W Patch Causes Windows to Hang</h3>
 
<P>
After the server software has been updated with the addition of the
NEWREV 1W patch, network clients accessing 3270 services under Windows
may experience problems with their computers' locking, according to
Banyan.
<P>
Note: There is no workaround for this problem other than removing the
patch and going back to a former revision level.
<P>
<P><h3>Banyan Vines 3270/RA 3270 Hangs Because of Login Script</h3>
 
<P>
Banyan Vines 3270/RA 3270 may not function correctly after
an invalid login statement under Vines 4.0. The following causes the
problem:

<OL><P><LI>Choose the MS-DOS icon in Windows.

<P><LI>Execute the 3270 command. You receive a host screen.

<P><LI>Request the Time Sharing Operation (TSO). You will receive a Login
   dialog box.

<P><LI>Enter an invalid name/password combination for the 3270
   connection. You receive an invalid name/password message.

<P><LI>Before the screen is updated, press ALT+TAB to switch back to the
   Windows environment. The system hangs and the computer has to be
   turned off and restarted. (Pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL does not work.)
<P>
   Note: There is no workaround for this problem.
<P>
</OL><h3>Windows 3.0 and 3270 with Banyan Mail</h3>
 
<P>
To run Banyan Mail and 3270 Terminal Emulation simultaneously under
Windows 3.0, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Place the command
<P>
<P><PRE>      Z:\SETMSGS OFF
</PRE><P>
   in the Banyan start up batch file anywhere after the LOGIN
   command. Replace Z:\ with the path to the SETMSGS command if
   necessary. If this command is not used, and a network broadcast
   message appears, the 3270 communications link may be broken.

<P><LI>Start Banyan Vines and log on before entering Windows.

<P><LI>Set the PIF for the 3270 Terminal Emulator session for
   Background and Full Screen.

<P><LI>Set the PIF for Banyan Mail to run full screen with neither
   Background nor Exclusive selected.
