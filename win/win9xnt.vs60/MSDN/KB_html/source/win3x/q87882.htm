The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft WinLogin version 1.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Some MS-DOS-based networks use SHARE.EXE to provide file locking and
sharing capabilities. To run WinLogin 1.0 on these networks, SHARE
must be loaded on both the client and the server.
<P>
Some MS-DOS-based networks, including IBM PC LAN, do not fully support
the file locking (byte-range locking) necessary to use some types of
databases. WinLogin will not work with these networks.
<P>
For information about ordering Microsoft WinLogin, call the Microsoft Sales
Information Center (MSIC) at (800) 426-9400, or mail the form supplied with
the Windows Resource Kit (WRK) for the Microsoft Windows operating system
version 3.1.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Using SHARE.EXE</h3>
 
<P>
The default number of files and locks that SHARE.EXE uses may need to be
increased for WinLogin to operate properly. The recommended configuration
for SHARE.EXE is as follows:
<P>
<PRE>  SHARE /L:200 /F:4096

</PRE>This line will provide sufficient files and locks for most WinLogin
installations.
<P>
<P><h3>Sharing Violations</h3>
 
<P>
A "Sharing Violation on Drive X:" error may occur during the setup of
WinLogin 1.0 in the following situations:

<OL><P><LI>After the client installation of WinLogin has completed. The
   VER.DLL file is being used by both Windows and the WinLogin setup
   programs.
<P>
   To correct for this problem, choose the OK button on the error
   dialog, then close and re-start Windows to run as a WinLogin client.

<P><LI>If the WinLogin Setup fails. Check for the existence of the
   directory called "\MS-SETUP.T" that may have been left in the root
   directory of the local hard drive. If this directory exists, and it
   contains the file, VER.DLL, then any subsequent attempts to run
   Setup will produce the Sharing Violation message.
<P>
   To correct for this problem:
<P>
   a. Delete all files from this directory.
<P>
   b. Remove the directory from the hard drive and rerun Setup.
<P>
</OL>For further information about WinLogin, query on the following word in
