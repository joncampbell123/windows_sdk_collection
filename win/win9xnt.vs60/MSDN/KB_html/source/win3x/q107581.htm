The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
The following article contains information on the use of Windows for
Workgroups with third-party products or configurations that have not been
tested and are not supported by Microsoft.
<P>
If the steps or procedures described in this article do not function
properly, contact the manufacturer of the third-party product for more
information or use a supported configuration.
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If you install Windows for Workgroups 3.11 using the SETUP /N command on a
workstation without a hard disk (a "diskless" workstation), and you then
run a NET USE command in a Windows for Workgroups virtual machine (VM), all
Novell NetWare drive mappings, all Windows for Workgroups drive
connections, and all Windows for Workgroups printer connections are
displayed (in that order).
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
On a computer with a hard disk drive and a SETUP /N configuration (or a
local installation of Windows for Workgroups with Novell NetWare), a NET
USE command in a Windows for Workgroups VM displays only the existing
Windows for Workgroups drive and printer connections.
<P>
However, all network connections (both NetWare mappings and Windows for
Workgroups connections) are displayed in a Windows for Workgroups VM if the
following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>You have a SETUP /N configuration on a diskless NetWare workstation as a
   second network under Windows for Workgroups.

<LI>All startup files are on a boot disk image.

<LI>All startup files are on the network.

<LI>The Windows directory is located on the network.

<LI>All Windows files are on the network.

<LI>All above directories and files must be in the NetWare search
   paths.
