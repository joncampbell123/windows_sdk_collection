The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In Windows versions 3.0 and 3.0a, Windows no longer uses expanded memory
for the advantage of Windows applications except in real mode.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Expanded memory management under Windows 3.0 or 3.0a is handled as follows.
<P>
<P><h3>Real Mode</h3>
 
<P>
Real mode Windows 3.0/3.0a uses expanded memory in the same manner as
Windows/286 versions 2.1x.
<P>
When Windows runs in real mode, expanded memory may be provided by the
following:

<UL><LI>On 8088/80286 machines, an expanded memory board's driver, which
   is the only genuine method to obtain LIM standard expanded
   memory on these processors. However, of course, we recommend
   reconfiguring the board as extended memory if it is being used
   on a 286 machine and expanded memory is not absolutely required
   by an MS-DOS application.

<LI>On 386 machines, the Microsoft EMM386.SYS driver, included with
   the Windows 3.0/3.0a package, which converts 386 extended
   memory to expanded via the special capabilities of the 386
   processor.
<P>
</UL><h3>286 Protected Mode</h3>
 
<P>
When Windows runs in 286 protected mode, expanded memory may be provided by
the following:

<UL><LI>On 286 machines, an expanded memory board's driver, as above. In
   this case, Windows doesn't use the supplied expanded memory because
   Windows is running in protected mode. However, expanded memory may
   be used by MS-DOS applications running before, during, or after
   Windows.

<LI>On 386 machines, the Microsoft EMM386.SYS driver. Here, any
   extended memory converted to expanded by EMM386.SYS prior to
   running 286 protected mode is unavailable to Windows. Additionally,
   expanded memory may be allocated by an application or driver via
   EMM386.SYS prior to running Windows and not cause problems.
<P>
</UL><h3>386 Enhanced Mode</h3>
 
<P>
In 386 enhanced mode, expanded memory may be provided by the following:

<UL><LI>Windows, which provides expanded meory emulation for MS-DOS
   applications running under Windows in 386 enhanced mode virtual
   machines.

<LI>If expanded memory is also required outside of Windows/386
   enhanced mode, it may be supplied in one of two forms depending
   on the requirements of the application/driver that needs
   expanded memory:
<P>
<P><PRE>    -- By the Microsoft EMM386.SYS driver (in a manner similar to
       that noted above)
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       - or -
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    -- By the Windows/386 enhanced mode WINSTART.BAT feature. If
       Windows enhanced mode detects that a WINSTART.BAT batch file
       is present in the path when Windows is executed, the following
       procedure is performed:
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       1. Loads the Windows/386 enhanced mode memory management,
<PRE></PRE>          including expanded memory emulation.

       2. Runs WINSTART.BAT, allowing any programs or drivers
          executing therein to use the emulated expanded memory
          loaded in Step 1. This may include starting a network
          that loads network drivers in expanded memory.

       3. Loads the Windows interface.

       NOTE: WINSTART.BAT is simply a means of loading some programs in
       Windows that can use expanded memory. It doesn't provide expanded
       memory, it just allows you to run programs that want to use it.
