The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When Windows 3.0 is set up on a network workstation via the SETUP /N
command, at least three default program groups, Main, Games, and
Accessories, are created. Each of these groups have a certain number
of default program items.
<P>
It is possible to have custom new groups created with selected program
items or change the contents of the default program groups by editing
the SETUP.INF before running SETUP /N on the individual workstations.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Use the following outline to create custom groups via the SETUP.INF file.

<OL><P><LI>Edit SETUP.INF with a standard ASCII text editor and locate the
   line:
<P>
<P><PRE>      [progman.groups]
</PRE>
<P><LI>Add a blank line directly under Games, and, on this line, type the
   name of the new group you want to have built:
<P>
<P><PRE>      [progman.groups]
      Main,1
      Accessories
      Games
      MyWork
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      The ",1" parameter indicates which group will be the default
      "open" group upon starting Windows.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Add a new section header after the listing of groups and a list of
   what program items you want to appear in this group:
<P>
<P><PRE>      [MyWork]
<PRE></PRE>      "Solitaire",   SOL.EXE
      "StyleSheet",  "NOTEPAD.EXE STYLESH.TXT"
      "GammaWrite",  GW.EXE

</PRE></OL>The new group "MyWork" will have three program items in it. "Solitaire" is
the word that appears under the icon and the executable file is SOL.EXE.
"StyleSheet" is a text file on company style that will be represented as an
icon for quick reference. The command line is in quotation marks because
there is a space between the two filenames. "GammaWrite" is a third-party
utility program item. Because it does not come with Windows, it is
necessary to add GW.EXE to the end of two other sections of the SETUP.INF,
[dontfind] and [win.apps]. If this program is not located in the shared
Windows directory, supply a full path description to the executable file.
<P>
The SETUP.INF file is a comma-delineated text file formatted for 160
columns that supplies customized directions to the SETUP.EXE.
<P>
<P><h3>Preferred Workstation Setup Method</h3>
 
<P>
Install Windows 3.0 on a network (see pages 543-556 of the "Microsoft
Windows User's Guide"), and then run the SETUP /N command on each
workstation. In some instances (for example, large workstation groups) it
may not be efficient to do this and then customize each workstation
individually. By editing the SETUP.INF file with a text editor, it is
possible to enhance the SETUP /N command so that it customizes each
workstation to a company standard.
