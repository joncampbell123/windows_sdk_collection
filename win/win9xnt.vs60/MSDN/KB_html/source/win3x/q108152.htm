The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 

<UL><LI>The utilities that STAC Electronics Stacker 3.1 installs in Windows for
   Workgroups 3.11 File Manager do not work when 32-bit file access is
   enabled.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>When you are using Stacker version 4.0, you cannot use 32-bit file
   access on any compressed drive.
<P>
</UL>NOTE: 32-bit disk access is still available on any compressed or
uncompressed drive.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem with Stacker 3.1, disable 32-bit file access
while you are using the utilities. To do this, choose the 386 Enhanced icon
in Control Panel, choose the Virtual Memory button, choose Change, and then
clear the 32-Bit File Access check box. You can restore 32-bit file access
when you are finished using the utilities without causing any damage to the
disk.
<P>
If you are using Stacker version 4.0, you can work around this problem by
obtaining a file that enables the use of 32-bit file access on Stacker-
compressed drives. This self-extracting file (S32BFA.EXE) is available on
the STAC Electronics bulletin board service (BBS). Although this file has
been tested by STAC Electronics, as of 8/29/94, the beta test is not yet
complete. S32BFA.EXE can be downloaded from LIB:1 in the STAC forum on the
STAC Electronics BBS. For more information, contact STAC Electronics.
<P>
STAC Electronics also suggests that you can work around this problem by
loading SMARTDrive from your AUTOEXEC.BAT file. You can use the 386
Enhanced icon in Control Panel to set up a swap file and 32-bit file access
for any uncompressed drive. Stacker adds an icon called Virtual Memory to
Control Panel. You can set up a swap file on any drive and enable 32-bit
disk access with this icon.
<P>
Stacker 3.1 adds the following menu to File Manager:
<P>
<PRE>   Stacker
   -------

   File Info
   Disk Info

</PRE>If you try to choose one of these menu items, the following error message
is displayed:
<P>
<PRE>   Stacker not installed

</PRE>The Stacker volume file still functions properly with 32-bit file access
enabled, and all files are available normally.
