<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When the application FAX.EXE (supplied with Intel's SatisFAXtion fax
board) is displaying an incoming fax in an MS-DOS window, two sets of
moving mouse cursors are displayed.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Intel's SatisFAXtion fax board comes with a MS-DOS-based program called
FAX.EXE. This program allow you to send files and documents as faxes, and
to view incoming faxes on the screen. When a fax is viewed on the screen,
the program switches into graphics mode (640 x 480 monochrome). A graphic
mouse cursor appears along with Windows-like scroll bars.
<P>
When a fax is displayed in a window, moving the mouse causes the Windows
arrow cursor to move as well as FAX.EXE's mouse cursor. The two cursors
move at different speeds; only the "native" mouse cursor is the one that
works. The application's mouse cursor doesn't move across the whole window;
only a few square inches of the upper-left corner.
<P>
The products included here are manufactured by vendors independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these
products' performance or reliability.
