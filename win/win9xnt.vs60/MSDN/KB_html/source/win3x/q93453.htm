1.0 Printing Extended or International Characters
 
<P>
In addition to the 128 standard ASCII characters you can type by using
your keyboard, you can use extended or international characters by
using the Character Map application. For more information, see Help
for Character Map.
<P>
When Windows prints a file, each character you typed while using your
application is translated from the Windows character to the
appropriate character on your printer. If your printer supports the
same character, the character prints. Otherwise, some other character,
such as a period or other filler character, prints instead. Check your
printer manual and experiment with your printer to determine which
extended characters are supported.
<P>
Note: This limitation applies only to the printer's hardware fonts.
Fonts provided by Windows for Workgroups do print the extended
characters.
<P>
<P><h3>2.0 Upgrading Windows Version 3.0 Laser-Printer Drivers</h3>
 
<P>
If you are upgrading to Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 and have a
laser printer installed, you should upgrade your printer driver to
version 3.1. Earlier versions of laser-printer drivers do not support
TrueType fonts. If you have not yet upgraded your laser-printer
driver, you can do so by using the Printers option in Control Panel or
the Printer Setup command in Print Manager. For more information, see
Chapter 5, "Print Manager," in the Microsoft Windows for Workgroups
User's Guide, or see the information about printing in Chapter 6,
"Troubleshooting," in Getting Started.
<P>
<P><h3>3.0 Configuring Your Printer's DIP-Switch Settings</h3>
 
<P>
The following printer models require certain DIP-switch settings in
order to work properly in Windows for Workgroups. Make sure you
configure your printer's DIP-switch settings before you install your
printer.
<P>
<P><h3>3.1 Canon Bubble-Jet BJ-10e and BJ-130e</h3>
 
<P>
All DIP switches should be set to the factory-default position. For
the BJ-10e and BJ-130e models, this is the OFF position.
<P>
3.2 Epson 9-Pin and 24-Pin
<P><h3>Printers Supported by Windows for Workgroups</h3>
 
<P>
The following DIP-switch settings are required for all Epson 9-pin and
24-pin printers:
<P>
<PRE>   Auto LineFeed: OFF
   Skip Over Perf: OFF

</PRE>3.3 Fujitsu 9-Pin and 24-Pin
<P><h3>Printers Supported by Windows for Workgroups</h3>
 
<P>
The following DIP-switch settings are required for all Fujitsu 9-pin
and 24-pin printers:
<P>
<PRE>   Color:  AUTOSEL
   LF Code:  LF Only
   CR Code:  CR Only
   Emulate:  DPL24/DPL24C

</PRE><h3>4.0 Notes About PostScript Printers and Cartridges</h3>
 
<P>
This section contains information specific to PostScript printers.
<P>
<P><h3>4.1 Installing a PostScript Printer</h3>
 
<P>
When installing a PostScript printer, make sure you select the name of
your printer model (not PostScript Printer) from the List Of Printers
box in the Printers dialog box. If you select PostScript Printer, you
may encounter problems when printing. However, if you are using Finale
(manufactured by CODA), this is not the case.
<P>
4.2 Installing Support for Additional PostScript Printers
 
<P>
If you are using a PostScript printer that is not listed in the List
Of Printers box in the Printers dialog box, you need to install a
Windows PostScript Definition (WPD) file for the printer. To do this,
use the Printers option in Control Panel or the Printer Setup command
in Print Manager, and select Install Unlisted Or Updated Printer in
the List Of Printers box.
<P>
Windows for Workgroups requires an OEMSETUP.INF file to install the
WPD file. In drive A, insert the Windows for Workgroups disk that
contains this file, and then follow the instructions for setting up a
printer. For more information about installing a printer, see Chapter
5, "Print Manager," in the Microsoft Windows for Workgroups User's
Guide. If you have a WPD file created for Windows version 3.0, you do
not need an OEMSETUP.INF file.
<P>
4.3 Printing a PostScript Print File in UNIX
 
<P>
The PostScript printer driver inserts a CTRL+D key combination at the
beginning of every print job to reset the printer. Because UNIX
systems recognize CTRL+D as an end-of-file character, any print files
you create by using the PostScript printer driver do not print in
UNIX. You can correct this problem by removing the CTRL+D key
combination from the print job. To do this, add the following setting
to the [ModelName,Port] section in the WIN.INI file (where ModelName
is the name of your PostScript printer model):
<P>
<PRE>   CtrlD=0

</PRE>For more information about editing the WIN.INI file, see the
WININI.WRI online document.
<P>
4.4 Printing TrueType Fonts in Place
<P><h3>of Other Fonts on a PostScript Printer</h3>
 
<P>
In most cases, the PostScript printer driver can evaluate the fonts in
your document and determine whether to use the Windows TrueType fonts,
the fonts built into your printer, or downloaded soft fonts.
<P>
In some cases, the printer driver can use either the Windows TrueType
fonts or the printer fonts, as in the following examples:
<P>
You are using a True Image printer that includes built-in TrueType
fonts that have the same name as the Windows TrueType fonts, such as
Times New Roman.
<P>
You want to print a document in Windows for Workgroups version 3.1
that was created by using Windows version 3.0, and the document
contains a font that is no longer supported, such as Tms Rmn. In this
case, the closest matching printer font is Times, and the closest
matching Windows font is Times New Roman; both are acceptable for
printing.
<P>
If the driver can use either the Windows TrueType fonts or the printer
fonts, it uses the printer fonts by default. If you want the driver to
use the Windows TrueType fonts instead, add the following setting to
the [ModelName,Port] section in the WIN.INI file (where ModelName is
the name of your PostScript printer model):
<P>
<PRE>   ttfavor=1

</PRE>To use the printer fonts again, set this value to 0.
<P>
For more information about editing the WIN.INI file, see the
WININI.WRI online document.
<P>
4.5 Controlling TrueType Font Downloading on PostScript Printers
 
<P>
When setting printer options for a PostScript printer, you can specify
that TrueType fonts be downloaded as Adobe Type 1 fonts. You do this
by using the Send To Printer As option in the Advanced Options dialog
box for the PostScript printer driver. This setting causes smaller
TrueType fonts to be printed as bitmaps and larger TrueType fonts to
be printed as outline fonts.
<P>
By using the MinOutlineEppem setting in the WIN.INI file, you can
specify (in the number of points per em) exactly when TrueType fonts
should be printed as bitmaps and when they should be printed as
outline fonts. To do this, add the following setting to the
[ModelName,Port] section in the WIN.INI file (where ModelName is the
name of your PostScript printer model):
<P>
<PRE>   minoutlineeppem=&lt;number&gt;

</PRE>The default value for number of points per em is 101. Fonts whose
points per em are fewer than the number you specify are downloaded as
bitmaps. Fonts whose points per em are greater are downloaded as
outline fonts. To conserve printer memory, decrease the value. To
produce high-quality printed fonts at larger point sizes, increase the
value. Increasing the value also speeds up printing time but requires
more memory.
<P>
For more information about editing the WIN.INI file, see the
WININI.WRI online document.
<P>
4.6 Setting the Timeout for PostScript Printers
 
<P>
Some PostScript printers require a high timeout value in order to
print complex documents. If you selected the Print PostScript Error
Information check box in the Advanced Options dialog box when you
configured your printer and your printer is printing timeout messages,
try increasing the printer's timeout value. To specify the timeout
value for your printer, add the following setting to the
[ModelName,Port] section in the WIN.INI file (where ModelName is the
name of your PostScript printer model):
<P>
<PRE>   timeout=&lt;number-of-seconds&gt;

</PRE>For example, if you want to set the printer timeout to 10 minutes on
an Apple LaserWriter IINT connected to LPT1, you would add the
following setting to the [Apple LaserWriter IINT,LPT1] section of the
WIN.INI file:
<P>
<PRE>   timeout=600

</PRE>NOTE: The timeout setting and the Timeouts options in the Printer
Connect dialog box are unrelated. The timeout setting specifies the
timeout value for your printer, whereas the Timeouts options in the
Printer Connect dialog box specify the timeouts for Windows.
<P>
For more information about configuring your printer and setting
Timeouts options for Windows, see Help for Print Manager or Control
Panel. For more information about editing the WIN.INI file, see the
WININI.WRI online document.
<P>
<P><h3>4.7 Rotating EPS Files When Printing in Landscape Mode</h3>
 
<P>
If the placement or orientation of imported images (such as EPS files)
is incorrect when printing in landscape mode from an application that
supports imported files, try adding the following setting to the
[ModelName,Port] section of the WIN.INI file (where ModelName is the
name of your PostScript printer model):
<P>
<PRE>   LandScapeOrient=270

</PRE>For more information about editing the WIN.INI file, see the
WININI.WRI online document.
<P>
5.0 Notes About Hewlett-Packard, Canon, and PCL Printers and Plotters
 
<P>
This section contains information specific to printing on Hewlett-
Packard, Canon, and PCL printers and plotters.
<P>
<P><h3>5.1 Configuring Memory on PCL Printers</h3>
 
<P>
If you are using a PCL printer, you may want to configure printer
memory to reserve a portion of it for permanently downloaded fonts or
macros. To do this, you can add two settings to the [HPPCL,Ports]
section of your WIN.INI file:
<P>
MemReserve=&lt;kilobytes&gt; specifies the amount of total printer memory
that is reserved. For example, if you are using permanently downloaded
soft fonts that occupy 300K of memory, you can add MemReserve=300 to
your WIN.INI file. You do not need to add this setting if you use the
Font Installer program provided with Windows for Workgroups to
download your fonts. In this case, the printer driver can
automatically detect how much memory is taken up by the fonts.
<P>
ResetPrinter=&lt;0, 1, 2&gt; specifies when the driver should reset printer
memory. If the value is 0, the driver resets printer memory when the
amount of memory available for printing (the total amount less the
value for MemReserve) is low. If the value is 1, the driver resets
printer memory after printing each page. If the value is 2, the driver
never resets printer memory. In most cases, a value of 0 works,
providing that the value for MemReserve is accurate. If you are
printing a large document that contains complex graphics, you may want
to specify a value of 1.
<P>
For more information about editing the WIN.INI file, see the
WININI.WRI online document.
<P>
5.2 Simulating Bold Type on PCL Printers
 
<P>
The Windows for Workgroups PCL driver no longer simulates bold for a
font that does not include a bold font style. For example, if you use
a cartridge or soft font in your application that includes only a
regular font style and you format text as bold, the text prints in the
regular font style on a PCL printer.
<P>
<P><h3>5.3 Printing from PageMaker Version 3.x to a PCL Printer</h3>
 
<P>
Aldus PageMaker version 3.x expects a text band to be sent if you are
printing to a PCL printer. If you are using a 3.x version of
PageMaker, you need to add the following line to the [HPPCL,Port]
section of your WIN.INI file in order to print successfully:
<P>
<PRE>   ForceTextBand=1

</PRE>For more information about editing the WIN.INI file, see the
WININI.WRI online document.
<P>
5.4 Using the Hewlett-Packard LaserJet IIIsi in PostScript Mode
 
<P>
If you are using a LaserJet IIIsi printer in PostScript mode, make
sure the PRT PS ERRS option on your printer panel's menu is turned off
(this is the factory-default setting), unless you are writing
PostScript programs and need error information for debugging. If this
option is on, your print jobs pause and a message appears on your
printer's panel each time a PostScript error is encountered. In most
cases, your documents still print, but the printing process is
interrupted.
<P>
5.5 Using Intellifont for Windows Version 1.0
with Hewlett-Packard LaserJet III Printers
 
<P>
If you install Intellifont for Windows version 1.0 after setting up
Windows for Workgroups version 3.1, you must reinstall the LaserJet
III printer driver by using the Printers option in Control Panel or
the Printer Setup command in Print Manager. The installation program
for Intellifont for Windows installs an earlier version of the
LaserJet III printer driver. This driver does not work correctly with
Windows for Workgroups.
<P>
<P><h3>5.6 Upgrading HP LaserJet Series III Printer Drivers</h3>
 
<P>
The HP LaserJet III printer driver included with Windows for
Workgroups is named HPPCL5MS.DRV. In earlier versions of Windows, this
driver was named HPPCL5A.DRV. If you upgrade to Windows for
Workgroups, the Setup program updates the printer driver for the HP
LaserJet III printer. However, some applications store the information
about the printer-driver file with the document, and if you try to
print a document that you created before you upgraded to Windows for
Workgroups, you may receive a message notifying you that the printer
driver cannot be found. If this happens, choose the Printer Setup
command in your application to update the driver information stored in
the document.
<P>
<P><h3>5.7 Using the Hewlett-Packard DeskJet 500 Printer Driver</h3>
 
<P>
If you are using the HP DeskJet 500 printer driver provided by
Hewlett-Packard with the HP DeskJet 500 printer, you need to adjust
the resolution setting to print at 300 dpi. To do this, first try
adjusting the resolution setting in the printer setup dialog box by
using the Printers option in Control Panel or the Printer Setup
command in Print Manager. If this doesn't work, add the following line
to the [DJ500,Port] section of your WIN.INI file:
<P>
<PRE>   prtresfac=0

</PRE>For more information about editing the WIN.INI file, see the
WININI.WRI online document.
<P>
5.8 Printing Envelopes in Word for Windows Version 2.0
on a Hewlett-Packard DeskJet 500 Printer
 
<P>
If you are using the DeskJet 500 printer driver provided with Windows
for Workgroups, you may encounter difficulties when using Word for
Windows version 2.0 to print envelopes on a Hewlett-Packard DeskJet
500 printer.
<P>
To correct the problem:

<OL><P><LI>In Word for Windows, choose the Options command from the Tools
   menu.

<P><LI>In the Category list, select the Win.ini button.

<P><LI>In the Option box, type hpdskjet

<P><LI>In the Setting box, type +1

<P><LI>Choose the Close button.
<P>
</OL>You can also add the following line to the [Microsoft Word 2.0]
section of your WIN.INI file:
<P>
<PRE>   hpdskjet=+1

</PRE></OL>For more information about editing the WIN.INI file, see the
WININI.WRI online document.
<P>
5.9 Printing TrueType Fonts on Canon Series II and III Laser Printers
 
<P>
The Canon series II and III laser printers do not support incremental
downloading of TrueType fonts. To print TrueType fonts by using one of
these printers, you must select the Enable TrueType Fonts check box in
the printer setup dialog box for the printer. This option supports the
printing of TrueType fonts on these printers by printing them as
graphics. This check box is selected by default when a Canon series II
or III printer is installed.
<P>
If the Enable TrueType Fonts check box is not selected, TrueType fonts
cannot be printed on these printers and are not available in your
Windows-based applications; only printer and plotter fonts are
available. For more information about setting printer options, see
Chapter 5, "Print Manager," in the Microsoft Windows for Workgroups
User's Guide.
<P>
5.10 Printing Graphics on a Canon Bubble-Jet BJ-10e or BJ-130e
 
<P>
If you are printing in 360x360 dpi graphics mode and part of the
graphics images in your documents are missing, make sure the DIP
switch to control graphics image density is set to HIGH.
<P>
<P><h3>5.11 Adjusting Hewlett-Packard Plotter Margins</h3>
 
<P>
If you are using one of the plotters in the following list, you can
probably correct margin problems by experimenting with the margin
settings in your application and by turning on the Expand switch on
your plotter:
<P>
<PRE>   hP 7580 A,B (hardware switch on back panel, pin #9)
   HP 7585 A,B (hardware switch on back panel, pin #9)
   HP DraftPro DXL, EXL (hardware switch on back panel, pin #9)
   DraftMaster I, II (front panel selection)

</PRE>Turning on the Expand switch increases the plotting area by setting
the outer margins to the area under the grid wheels. However, this
might decrease plot quality.
<P>
5.12 Adding Distinct DocI/Comp Pub I and
<P><h3>Brilliant Pres I/Comp Pub II Font Cartridges</h3>
 
<P>
If you need to install these font cartridges for your LaserJet III
printer, you can do so by using the Font Installer.
<P>
To install the font cartridges:

<OL><P><LI>In Print Manager, choose Printer Setup from the Options menu.

<P><LI>In the Printers dialog box, select your printer from the list of
   installed printers, and then choose the Setup button.

<P><LI>In the printer driver dialog box, choose the Fonts button.

<P><LI>In the Font Installer dialog box, choose the Add Fonts button.

<P><LI>In the dialog box that appears, type the path for your Windows
   SYSTEM directory-for example:
<P>
<P><PRE>     c:\windows\system
</PRE>
<P><LI>Select the name of the cartridge you want to install, and then
   choose the OK button.
<P>
</OL><h3>6.0 Notes About Additional Printers and Font Packages</h3>
 
<P>
This section contains information specific to font packages and
printing on dot-matrix, 24-pin, Epson, and IBM printers.
<P>
6.1 Feeding Paper on Fujitsu Dot-Matrix Printers
 
<P>
The manual-feed option is not supported on Fujitsu dot-matrix
printers. All paper is automatically fed to the printer from the
roller.
<P>
6.2 Printing to an IBM Personal Pageprinter, Using the EPT Port
 
<P>
For best results, use the IBM Personal Pageprinter Adapter Program
version 1.3.1 or later.
<P>
If Windows is running in 386 enhanced mode and you want to print to an
IBM Personal Pageprinter assigned to the EPT port, you must set the
LPT1 device contention to never issue a warning. Standard mode does
not require special settings. For more information about managing
device requests, see Help for Control Panel.
<P>
6.3 Printing to an IBM Proprinter X24 or XL24,
Epson MX-80, or Okidata 24-Pin Printer
 
<P>
Because Print Manager sometimes interrupts the flow of data while
printing, you might notice erratic output if you are using an IBM
Proprinter X24 or XL24, Epson MX-80, or Okidata 24-pin dot-matrix
printer when Print Manager is active. These printers cannot
accommodate interruptions in data flow. To solve this problem, try
deactivating Print Manager.
<P>
If you still have problems after deactivating Print Manager, use the
following procedure.
<P>
To print to a file and then send the file to a printer:

<OL><P><LI>Using the Printer Setup command in Print Manager or the Printers
   option in Control Panel, connect to the port named FILE.

<P><LI>Choose the Print command in your Windows application.

<P><LI>Copy the print file to the port your printer is connected to.
<P>
</OL>For more information about activating and deactivating Print Manager,
see Help for Print Manager. For information about printing to a file,
see Chapter 5, "Print Manager," in the Microsoft Windows for
Workgroups User's Guide. For more information about printing to a
file, see your MS-DOS documentation.
<P>
NOTE: This problem should not occur when printing on an IBM Proprinter
X24e or XL24e.
<P>

<P>
To print TrueType Fonts on Kyocera F-Series printers, you must select
the Print TrueType As Graphics check box in the Options dialog box
when configuring your printer. Otherwise, TrueType fonts may not print
correctly. For more information about configuring printers, see

<P>
With some applications, you can change the settings for your printer
on a per- page basis. If you are using the Facelift version 1.0 soft-
font package from Bitstream, you cannot use this feature when printing
multiple-page documents.

<P><h3>6.7 Using the Cut-Sheet Feeder on the NEC Pinwriter P7 Printer</h3>
 
<P>
The Paper Source option, Cut Sheet Feeder, does not work properly with
the NEC Pinwriter P7 printer. To use the cut-sheet feeder as the paper
source, you must specify a left margin of about three inches for your
document so that text prints correctly on the page.
<P>
<P><h3>6.8 Using Separator Pages</h3>
 
<P>
If you are using one of the following printer models and the printer
is a local printer (attached to your computer), do not use the
separator-page feature in Print Manager. This feature is not supported
in these printer models.
