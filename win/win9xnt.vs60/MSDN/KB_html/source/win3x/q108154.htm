The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you run Beame and Whiteside's network file system (BW-NFS) for Lan
Workplace on open datalink interface (ODI) with Windows for Workgroups 3.11
and you set an NFS file system as a mounted drive, the drive is visible but
not accessible in Windows. (It appears as a blank disk.)
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is caused by a problem with the Beame and Whiteside NFS
redirector.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Although the directory appears empty, the files can be accessed if you know
the name of the file. Beame and Whiteside is aware of this problem.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Beame and Whiteside has developed new drivers to make Windows for
Workgroups 3.11 work with its product and the ODI stack. The problem in the
redirector will be addressed in a future release. For more information,
contact Beame and Whiteside at (905) 765-0822 (phone)or (905) 765-0815
(fax).
