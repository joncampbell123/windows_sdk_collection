<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If you try to delete a file marked read-only from File Manager, the
following warning message will be display:
<P>
<PRE>   Delete write-protected or hidden file...

</PRE>File Manager does allow you to delete the file if you choose to do so.
There is no way to prevent a read-only file from being deleted within
the File Manager.
<P>
MS-DOS, however, displays an access denied message and does not allow you
to delete the file.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
A possible option to prevent a read-only file from being deleted from
File Manager is to set its file attributes to Hidden, and do not
include it as a viewed document. Use the following steps to change a
file's attributes to Hidden from File Manager:

<OL><P><LI>From File Manager, select the file you want to hide.

<P><LI>From the File menu, select Change Attributes.

<P><LI>Put a check mark in the Read-Only box and in the Hidden
   box and select OK.

<P><LI>From the View menu, choose Include.

<P><LI>Clear the Show Hidden/System Files box and choose OK.
<P>
</OL>File Manager stills allow you to delete a read-only file; however,
by marking a file as Hidden, it is less likely to be deleted.
