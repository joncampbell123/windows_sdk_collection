<P>
Caution: If you use a network, read the information about
<PRE>         your network in this file BEFORE installing Windows
         3.1 and MS DOS 5.0.

</PRE>Note: This file contains information which should be used if
<PRE>      you are upgrading to both MS-DOS 5 and Windows 3.1. If
      for some reason you are upgrading only to Windows, see
      the NETWORKS.WRI file. For the location of the file, see
      the PACKING.LST file on Setup disk 1.

</PRE><P><LI>Introduction
<P>
</OL>If you use a network, you might need to update one or more files on
your hard disk before you set up Windows 3.1 and MS-DOS 5.0 on your
computer. This file contains basic information about upgrading
networks which is appropriate for someone with experience setting up
networks and personal computers. If you do not have this experience,
you should get someone who does to help you ensure your network
software is compatible with Windows 3.1 and MS-DOS 5.0.
<P>
In many cases, there are separate network files which may need
updating to support MS-DOS vs. Windows 3.1. Thus, you should find the
section of this document which pertains to the network you have and
read the entire section once before trying to do anything. In many
sections, there may be a subsection for the Windows procedure and a
subsection for the MS-DOS procedure.
<P>
There are new versions of files for many widely used networks included
with this package of Windows 3.1 and MS-DOS. To make these networks
compatible with Windows 3.1 and MS-DOS 5.0, follow the procedure
outlined for your network to install the appropriate file (or files)
on your hard disk. For some networks, the network vendor should supply
the necessary files.
<P>
Important: To find which Setup Disk has a specific file, use any text
editor to open the PACKING.LST file on Setup Disk 1 and then search
for the filename.
<P>
<P>
In general, if you are using a network:
<P>
o Check the list in Chapter 1, "Upgrading from a Previous
<PRE>  Version of DOS to Windows and MS-DOS," of "Getting Started"
  to determine whether your network needs to be updated.

</PRE></OL>o Follow the procedures in this file to update your
<PRE>  network files.

</PRE>o If you have trouble after updating, see
<PRE>  "Getting Started" for possible solutions.

</PRE>You need to be familiar with the following tasks to successfully carry
out the procedures in this file:
<P>
o Using MS-DOS to change drives and directories
<P>
o Working with network software
<P>
o Searching a disk for a file
<P>
o Searching a file for text
<P>
o Editing a text file
<P>
o Renaming or backing up files
<P>
o Working with paths
<P>
o Identifying when a file was created

<OL><P><LI>  General Notes
<P>
</OL>o There are many settings in the SYSTEM.INI file that affect
<PRE>  the way Windows interacts with a network. You can change
  these settings to correct most problems you might have
  operating Windows with your network. See the SYSINI.WRI
  online document for information about changing the
  following SYSTEM.INI settings:

  [Boot]
  Network.drv=

  [Standard]
  Int28Filter=
  NetHeapSize=

  [386Enh]
  AllVMsExclusive=
  EMMExclude=
  FileSysChange=
  InDOSPolling=
  Int28Critical=
  NetAsyncFallback=
  NetAsyncTimeout=
  NetDMASize=
  NetHeapSize=
  Network=
  PSPIncrement=
  ReflectDOSInt2A=
  TimerCriticalSection=
  TokenRingSearch=
  UniqueDOSPSP=

</PRE></OL>o Many networks require the TimerCriticalSection entry
<PRE>  in the [386Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file to be set
  to a value of 10000 or greater. For more information, see
  the SYSINI.WRI file.

</PRE>o The default value for the NetHeapSize entry in the
<PRE>  [Standard] section of the SYSTEM.INI file is 8K. Although
  some applications require this value, in most cases you
  can decrease the value to 4K in order to increase the
  amount of memory available to your applications. A few
  applications require the value to be 4K.

</PRE>o If for some reason you use Setup to change your
<PRE>  network configuration after you have already set up
  Windows, Setup might not remove all support for your
  previous network selection. Unnecessary files might be
  left in your Windows directory, and entries might be left
  in your WIN.INI or SYSTEM.INI files that could harm your
  system's performance. If you change your network
  configuration, check the notes about both your previous
  and new selections to see if any previous entries are no
  longer required.

</PRE>o Some network adapter cards require the
<PRE>  ExcludeHighRegion (or EMMExclude) entry in the [386Enh]
  section of the SYSTEM.INI file to be set to the memory
  range used by the card. For more information, see your
  network-adapter documentation and the SYSINI.WRI file.

  These cards may also require an X= option on the EMM386
  command line in your CONFIG.SYS file. For more
  information, see chapter 14, "Optimizing Windows," in the
  "Microsoft Windows User's Guide."

</PRE>o Some network cards and some network transport stacks
<PRE>  require special handling. Consult the following sections
  not only for the manufacturer of your network but also for
  the manufacturer of your network adapter and your
  transport stack.

</PRE>o Many networks have pop-up message facilities that
<PRE>  allow you to see messages sent from other servers or
  workstations. In most cases, these pop-up programs will
  cause the Windows part of Setup to fail if a message is
  received while setting up. Many networks provide
  additional utilities that allow them to work with Windows
  once Windows is set up, but these are generally not
  available during Setup. You should make sure any such pop-
  up service is disabled before setting up Windows. Please
  consult specific entries regarding your network in the
  following sections, or consult your network documentation
  for instructions.

</PRE>o If you configured your remote-boot workstation to run
<PRE>  Windows version 3.0, you may be loading a program called
  RIPLMEM.EXE or RPLMEM.EXE in your AUTOEXEC.BAT. This
  program is no longer required for running Windows version
  3.1.

</PRE>o The Windows Resource Kit for the Microsoft Windows
<PRE>  Operating System Version 3.1 contains additional
  information about setting up and configuring Windows for
  use with a network, and information for system
  administrators. This kit provides complete technical
  information about Windows version 3.1 for the support
  professional. It includes a technical reference manual,
  and a disk containing helpful utilities, system resource
  viewers, drivers, and accessories.

  To order the Windows Resource Kit within the United
  States, dial:

  1-800-642-7676

  To order outside of the United States, dial the phone
  number for your area. You can find this number on the
  International Subsidiary card.

</PRE>o If you are running a shared copy of Windows from a network
<PRE>  drive, make sure both your personal Windows directory and
  the shared network directory are included on the PATH
  command line in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

</PRE>o If you receive sharing violations while running a shared
<PRE>  copy of Windows, make sure that all of the files in the
  shared network directory are marked as read-only.

</PRE>o If you have problems running a shared copy of Windows,
<PRE>  remove the MS-DOS SHARE command from your system. With
  some networks, the MS-DOS SHARE utility must not be loaded
  on a workstation to run a shared copy of Windows.

</PRE>o If you have problems and your network software is loaded
<PRE>  high (in the upper memory area between 640K and 1 MB), try
  loading the network in conventional memory.

</PRE>o Windows Print Manager spools print jobs to the location
<PRE>  specified by the MS-DOS environment variable TEMP. If TEMP
  is not set, Print Manager will use the root of drive C.
  For diskless workstations, set the TEMP variable either to
  a RAM disk or to the location of a network directory (you
  must have full access to this directory). The TEMP
  variable may be set by placing a SET TEMP= statement in
  the AUTOEXEC.BAT file or network login script. For
  example, to spool to the network directory
  X:\USERNAME\WINUSER\TEMP, you would use the statement
  SET TEMP=x:\username\winuser\temp. Each user must have a
  personal TEMP directory.

</PRE>o On some diskless workstations, you will not be able to
<PRE>  start Windows in standard mode unless you have a TEMP
  environment variable set or you have added a swapdisk
  entry in the [NonWindowsApp] section of the SYSTEM.INI
  file. For more information about the swapdisk entry, see
  the SYSINI.WRI file.

</PRE>o If you are running a peer-to-peer network, you may not be
<PRE>  able to format a floppy disk by using File Manager. You
  can use the FORMAT command at the MS-DOS prompt instead.

</PRE>o Some networks ship with their own copies of files that are
<PRE>  included with Windows version 3.1. Usually Windows
  includes a newer version, and upgrades the one provided
  with the network when you run Setup. However, if you
  install the network after installing Windows 3.1, some
  network installation programs will overwrite the newer
  file provided with Windows with their own, older version.
  This older version may lack features provided in the newer
  version, or it may not function properly with Windows 3.1.
  You should back up your network and Windows files before
  upgrading your network software. If problems occur, you
  may need to restore the previous version of some files.

</PRE>o If you use the MS-DOS Shell, note that most network
<PRE>  software won't work correctly if you start it from an
  MS-DOS Shell command prompt. Start your network before
  starting MS-DOS Shell.

</PRE>o You can install both Windows and MS-DOS from a network
<PRE>  share point. To do so, carry out the following procedure:

  1. Make sure your network is running with at least one
     server and one client.

  2. Restart the client computer by inserting Setup disk 1
     into drive A, and pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL.

  3. Press ENTER at the Welcome screen. Then, at the next
     screen, press F3 twice to quit Setup.

  4. Create an INSTALL directory on the hard drive and make the
     drive current by typing the following at the command prompt:

     c:
     md install
     cd install

  5. Copy all the files on the disk to the INSTALL directory
     by typing the following at the command prompt:

     copy a:\*.* c:\install

  6. Insert each of the remaining Setup disks and copy all the files
     to the INSTALL directory.

  7. Expand the ATTRIB.EX_ file by typing the following at the
     command prompt:

     expand attrib.ex_ attrib.exe

  8. Insert Setup disk 1 into drive A.

  9. Remove the attributes from the IO.SYS and MSDOS.SYS files by typing
     the following at the command prompt:

     attrib -h -s -r a:\io.sys
     attrib -h -s -r a:\msdos.sys

  10. Copy the IO.SYS and MSDOS.SYS files to the INSTALL directory
      by typing the following at the command prompt:

      copy a:\io.sys c:\intall
      copy a:\msdos.sys c:\install

  11. Delete the ATTRIB.EXE file in the INSTALL directory by typing
      the following at the command prompt:

      del c:\install\attrib.exe

  12. Remove Setup disk 1 from drive A, and restart your computer
      by typing CTRL+ALT+DEL.

  13. Connect to the network and create a directory called DOSWIN
      on the network drive.

  14. Run Setup by typing the following at the command prompt:

      c:\install\setup /a

  15. Follow the directions on your screen.

  16. To install Windows and MS-DOS on a client computer from the
      network share point, connect to the network drive and run
      Setup by typing the following at the command prompt:

      dwsetup

  17. Follow the instructions on your screen.

</PRE>o If you have copied the Windows and MS-DOS files to a network
<PRE>  share point by typing "setup /a," and you want to run Windows
  from the network on a client computer, make sure you set up
  MS-DOS 5.0 only on the client computer before you type
  "setup /n."


</PRE><P><LI>Novell NetWare
<P>
</OL>Note: The procedures for Microsoft Windows 3.1 and MS-
<PRE>      DOS 5.0 are integrated in this section.

</PRE></OL>Additional Notes at Press Time:
<P>
<PRE>     NetWare Shell Version (NETX.COM):

     The NetWare workstation shell software is Novell's
     basic DOS shell and is included with MS-DOS 5.0.  You
     may require a different shell for a specific
     application.  Contact your authorized Novell reseller
     if you believe another shell may be needed. EMSNET5.EXE
     and XMSNET5.EXE, alternate shells, are available from
     Novell.

     Novell Remote Workstations (RPLFIX.COM):
     If you can't load MS-DOS 5.0 on your remote-boot
     workstation, contact Novell for the RPLFIX.COM file.

     Drive Mapping Utilities:
     If you run LOGIN.EXE, MAP.EXE, and SESSION.EXE from MS-
     DOS Shell or while MS-DOS Shell is running, a search
     path is not added to the existing path. Use these
     programs before starting MS-DOS Shell.

     TBMI2.COM and Task Swapper:
     If you can't use Task Swapper in MS-DOS Shell when
     running a Novell network, do the following:
     1. Expand and copy the IPX.OB_ and TBMI2.CO_ files to
        your hard disk. If your AUTOEXEC.BAT file has a
        command that loads the NET3.COM or NET4.COM file,
        expand and copy the file from the Setup disk to
        the hard drive.

        See the PACKING.LST file on Setup
        disk 1 for the location of the files and for
        instructions on how to use the EXPAND command.

     2. Use the IPX.OBJ file to create a new IPX.COM file.
        For information about creating an IPX.COM file, see
        your Novell documentation.

     3. Start your network, using the new IPX.COM and
        NETX.COM files.

     4. Start TBMI2.COM.

     5. Start the application that may be causing problems
        with Task Swapper.  Run the application and then exit.

     6. Display diagnostic information by typing the
        following:
        tbmi2 /d

     7. If the value in the field named Far Call Usage is
        not 0, you need to run TBMI2.COM before using Task
        Swapper.

        To get help with TBMI2.COM, type the following:
        tbmi2 /?

        The default configuration for TBMI2.COM is correct for
        most applications. If you need help configuring the
        program, contact Novell.


</PRE>The Windows 3.1 and MS-DOS 5.0 Upgrade includes updated
versions of several Novell NetWare files that are required
to run with Windows 3.1. If you are running Novell NetWare,
the Windows part of Setup will copy the following files to
the SYSTEM subdirectory of your Windows directory (or the
shared network directory if you set up a shared copy of
Windows by using setup /n):
<P>
NETX.COM (version 3.26)
IPX.OBJ (version 3.10)
TBMI2.COM (version 2.1)
IPXODI.COM (version 1.20)
LSL.COM (version 1.21)
<P>
Before running Windows you may need to do the following:
<P>
o Replace your current NetWare shell with the NETX.COM
<PRE>  provided (if your current NetWare shell is older than the
  version provided). Windows 3.1 requires that the NetWare
  shell components on your workstation (such as NETX.COM) be
  version 3.01 or higher. You can use these shell components
  even if your servers are running older versions of NetWare
  (as early as NetWare 2.10).

  Your current shell may have one of the following names:

  NET3.COM        XMSNET3.EXE     EMSNET3.EXE
  NET4.COM        XMSNET4.EXE     EMSNET4.EXE
  NETX.COM        XMSNET5.EXE     EMSNET5.EXE
  NETX.COM        XMSNETX.EXE     EMSNETX.EXE

  NETX.COM will run on MS-DOS versions 3.1 or higher. The
  EMS and XMS versions of the shell are available from your
  Novell dealer and the Microsoft Windows Driver Library
  (WDL). For information about ordering the WDL, see
  "You have special hardware to set up with Windows" in
  Chapter 3, "Troubleshooting During Setup," of "Getting
  Started."

</PRE>Note: The EMS NetWare shells (EMSNETX.EXE, etc.) are not
<PRE>      supported when Windows is running in 386 enhanced mode.

</PRE>If you have a NetWare version earlier than 2.1, contact your
network vendor for an update.
<P>
To update the NETX command for NetWare versions 3.11 or
earlier:

<OL><P><LI>Expand and copy the NETX.CO_ file to your network directory.
   See the PACKING.LST file on Setup disk 1 for the location of
   the files and for instructions on how to use the EXPAND command.

<P><LI>Replace the network startup command in your
   AUTOEXEC.BAT file with the NETX command.
<P>
</OL>After you complete the procedure, set up MS-DOS 5.0 on your
computer. For information about installing MS-DOS 5.0, see
"Getting Started."
<P>
Note: If you use any programs specific to Internetwork
<PRE>      Packet Exchange (IPX), such as NVER, SYSCON, and
      RCONSOLE, you need to take additional steps to run
      these programs with MS-DOS Task Swapper. For more
      information about running these programs with MS-DOS
      Task Swapper, see the README.TXT file. See the
      PACKING.LST file on Setup disk 1 for the location of
      the README.TXT file.

</PRE></OL>o If you are running Novell IPXODI.COM and LSL.COM, you need
<PRE>  to upgrade these to versions 1.20 or higher. Use the files
  provided with Windows and copy them from the SYSTEM
  subdirectory of your Windows directory (or your shared
  network directory) to the directory where your existing
  versions are located.

</PRE>o To run Windows in standard mode, load the TBMI2.COM memory-
<PRE>  resident utility when running Windows. Novell recommends
  that you create a batch file that will load this utility,
  start Windows, and then unload the utility when you quit
  Windows. The batch file could be named RUNWIN.BAT and look
  like this:

  TBMI2
  WIN
  TBMI2 /U

  TBMI2 enables you to safely run applications that use the
  NetWare IPX and SPX functions in standard mode Windows or
  the MS-DOS 5.0 task switcher.

</PRE>o If you are running Novell IPX.COM, create a new version using
<PRE>  the IPX.OBJ file. For information about creating an IPX.COM
  file, see your Novell documentation.

</PRE>In addition:
<P>
o If you enable 32-bit disk access and you are running the
<PRE>  XMS shell rather than one of the standard NetWare shells
  (NETX.COM, etc.), you can further improve performance by
  setting the OverlappedIO entry in the [386Enh] section of
  your SYSTEM.INI file to On.

</PRE>o Do not try to log in, log out, attach, or detach a Novell
<PRE>  server from the MS-DOS Prompt within Windows. You should log
  in before starting Windows, and attach or detach servers
  by using File Manager or the Printers option in Control
  Panel.

</PRE>o If you experience problems starting applications while
<PRE>  running Windows or Windows applications from a file
  server, make sure you are not running the MS-DOS SHARE
  utility. Current versions of the NetWare shell are not
  fully compatible with SHARE.

</PRE>o If you have a Western Digital Ethercard Plus and have
<PRE>  problems accessing drives by using the MAP ROOT command,
  contact Western Digital for an updated driver.

</PRE>o By default, NetWare gives you access to only 40 files at a
<PRE>  time. When you are running applications with Windows, you
  can exceed this limit rather quickly. If so, you might see
  unexpected error messages. To increase the file access
  limit, add the following line to your SHELL.CFG file:

  file handles = 60

  You should also add the following to your CONFIG.SYS file:

  files = 60

</PRE>o If you get unusable output when printing to a NetWare
<PRE>  server (such as incorrect fonts, garbled text, invalid
  page breaks, or blank lines), you may need to edit your
  print-job configuration. Try using the NetWare PRINTCON
  utility to set the Auto Endcap and Enable Timeout options
  to No.

</PRE>o When running Windows in 386 enhanced mode, swapping to a
<PRE>  drive on a NetWare 286 server might make starting Windows
  take up to a minute. See Chapter 14, "Optimizing Windows,"
  in the "Microsoft Windows User's Guide" for information
  about controlling the location of your swap file.

</PRE>o A NetWare file server does not include the directory
<PRE>  entries dot (.) and double dot (..) as MS-DOS does.
  However, the NetWare shell (version 3.01 or higher) can
  emulate these entries when applications attempt to list
  the files in a directory. If you have problems listing
  files or deleting directories, turning on the Show Dots
  feature will help. Add the following line to your
  SHELL.CFG file:

  show dots = on

  Turning on Show Dots will cause problems with earlier
  versions of some 286-based NetWare utilities, such as
  BINDFIX.EXE and MAKEUSER.EXE. Make sure you upgrade these
  utilities if you upgrade your NetWare shell. For more
  information, contact your Novell dealer.

</PRE>o Redirected drives can look different in Windows than they
<PRE>  did without Windows. For example, a device mapped as
  FileServerName/Volume:Directory will appear in Windows as
  FileServerName/Volume:\, showing the root of the file
  server's shared volume, rather than the subdirectory you
  expected. You can correct this with the MAP ROOT entry
  explained in the following information.

</PRE>o In some cases, Windows applications may change the default
<PRE>  directory on a drive. This might cause problems if, for
  example, your path includes the current directory on a
  network drive (that is, your path includes a drive letter
  without a specific directory, such as z: instead of
  z:\system).

  You can prevent this problem by using MAP.EXE and
  LOGIN.EXE versions 3.0 and later to set up fake roots, or
  by choosing the MAP ROOT function when mapping a
  connection in File Manager. This feature simulates the
  MS-DOS SUBST command, which sets the root of a given drive
  to a directory designated by the user instead of to the
  true root of the volume.

  For example, suppose you normally mapped drive F to the
  HOME\TERRI directory on the COUNT\SYS volume, and then
  included F: in your path. You would do this by including
  the following command in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file or by
  typing the command before starting Windows:

  map f:=count\sys:home\terri

  The default directory on drive F would then be HOME\TERRI.
  To prevent Windows from changing this, you would replace
  the command above with the one shown below:

  map root f:=count\sys:home\terri

  This command would make the directory HOME\TERRI appear to
  be the root drive F.

</PRE>o If you are running Windows in 386 enhanced mode, you can
<PRE>  adjust the way Windows handles your network drive mappings
  by using the Network option in Control Panel.

  Normally, when you quit Windows, all of your drive
  mappings are restored to the way they were before you
  started Windows, and all changes you made inside Windows
  are lost. If you clear the Restore Drives option, the
  mappings you made inside Windows will remain when you quit
  Windows.

  Typically, each instance of the MS-DOS Prompt you start from
  Windows has its own set of drive mappings. Changes you
  make in one instance do not affect another. If you set the
  NWShareHandles option, drive mappings will instead be
  global, and changes made in one instance of the MS-DOS Prompt
  will affect all other applications. If you are running a
  NetWare 286 server, setting NWShareHandles increases the
  number of workstations that can be connected to the server
  before the server runs out of available connections.

  See the Help available in the Network dialog box in
  Control Panel for more information on these options.

</PRE>o When setting up Windows for use with Novell NetWare, the
<PRE>  following entry is added to the [windows] section of your
  WIN.INI file:

  load=nwpopup.exe

  This automatically starts the NetWare pop-up utility,
  which displays your incoming broadcast messages.

</PRE>o If you are running Novell NetBIOS, you may need to specify
<PRE>  TimerCriticalSection=10000 in the [386Enh] section of the
  SYSTEM.INI file.

</PRE>o If you have applications or files that use extended
<PRE>  characters (ASCII characters above 128) and you have
  problems viewing or using them, try adding the following
  line to your SHELL.CFG file:

  special uppercase = on

</PRE>o When connecting or disconnecting network resources from
<PRE>  File Manager,  Print Manager, or Control Panel, pay
  attention to the state of the Permanent check box. If this
  option is checked when you make a connection, the
  connection is automatically made each time you restart
  Windows. To stop reconnecting, disconnect with the
  Permanent option checked. If the option is not checked
  when you disconnect, the connection is removed for the
  current Windows session, but is reconnected when you
  restart Windows.

<P>
</OL>5.1. MS-DOS Procedure
<P>
Banyan VINES version 4.1 is compatible with MS-DOS 5.0.
You can use Banyan VINES version 4.0x with MS-DOS 5.0 if you
have the REDIRALL.EXE or REDIR4.EXE file in the BANYAN
directory on your hard disk.
<P>
If neither file is on your hard disk, but you have the VINES
installation disks that include one of  these files, copy
the file to the directory on your hard disk that contains
network files.
<P>
If the files are not on either your hard disk or the VINES
installation disks, contact your Banyan VINES network
vendor.
<P>
If you have a VINES version earlier than 4.0, contact your
network vendor for an update.
<P>
Note: If you are upgrading from MS-DOS version 4.x, you
<PRE>      do not need to update your network files.


</PRE></OL>5.2. Windows Procedure
<P>
<P>
Setup will correctly handle the following Banyan VINES
versions:
<P>
o Banyan VINES 4.0 is compatible with Microsoft Network and
<PRE>  will be handled as such by Windows.

</PRE>o Banyan VINES 4.1 and later come with additional Windows
<PRE>  components, which are installed when you set up Windows
  for use with Banyan VINES 4.1.

</PRE>See the following sections for information about running
these versions of VINES with Windows.
<P>
Note: You should start VINES and log in before starting
<PRE>      Windows. Banyan does not support logging in while
      Windows is running. If you start Windows when the
      network is not loaded or you are not logged in, you
      will receive one or more error messages indicating that
      you will not be able to use VINES functions from within
      Windows.


</PRE>5.2.1. Banyan VINES 4.0x
<P>
When you set up Windows for use with Banyan VINES 4.0x, the
following entries are added to the [386Enh] section of your
SYSTEM.INI file:
<P>
TimerCriticalSection=5000
UniqueDOSPSP=TRUE
PSPIncrement=5
<P>
See SYSINI.WRI for more information on these settings.
<P>
o To use Windows printing functions with VINES 4.0, you must
<PRE>  have VINES 4.00(5) or later and must have the NetBIOS
  support loaded. If you cannot print to a network printer,
  ask your network administrator to verify that you are
  loading NetBIOS and that you are running the proper
  version of VINES.

</PRE>o If you are running VINES 4.0 with Windows running in 386
<PRE>  enhanced mode and want to run non-Windows applications
  that use NetBIOS, you must install VINES 4.00(5) or later.
  In addition, you will need to start NetBIOS before
  starting Windows.

  If you start VINES NetBIOS support before starting Windows
  in standard mode, you may not be able to start any non-
  Windows applications. If you have this problem, load
  NetBIOS from within Windows, or contact your Banyan dealer
  for more information.

</PRE>o Versions below site-specific patch 0H will not support
<PRE>  Windows running in 386 enhanced mode.

</PRE>o If you are running VINES version 4.0x and you have a
<PRE>  problem with print jobs that time-out intermittently, you
  can either update to VINES 4.1x, or use the VINES SETPRINT
  utility to remove the timeout on your printer port by
  specifying the following:

  SETPRINT lptn servicename /D:INFINITE

  Lptn is the printer port, and servicename is the name of
  the network print queue.


</PRE>5.2.2. Banyan VINES 4.1x
<P>
When you set up Windows for use with Banyan VINES 4.1, the
following entries are added to the [386Enh] section of your
SYSTEM.INI file:
<P>
<PRE> Network=*dosnet, *vnetbios, vvinesd.386
 TimerCriticalSection=5000
 UniqueDOSPSP=TRUE
 PSPIncrement=5

</PRE>See SYSINI.WRI for more information on these settings.
<P>
In addition:
<P>
o If you are running VINES 4.10 or 4.11 (below 4.11(5)) and
<PRE>  you have problems printing, you may need to upgrade your
  VINES.DRV. This driver is available from Banyan.

</PRE>o If you are running Banyan VINES 4.10 or 4.11, you do not
<PRE>  need to load NetBIOS unless you are running NetBIOS-
  specific applications.  (It is not required for printing,
  as it is with VINES 4.0x.)

  If you are running version 4.10 and you want to run
  NetBIOS-specific applications with Windows running in 386
  enhanced mode, you must start NetBIOS before starting
  Windows. However, you can only run a single NetBIOS
  application at a time.

  If you are running version 4.11, you can load NetBIOS
  either before starting Windows or after starting Windows
  in 386 enhanced mode.

  If you want to run NetBIOS with Windows running in
  standard mode, you must load NetBIOS from within Windows.
  If you load NetBIOS before starting Windows, you will not
  be able to start any non-Windows applications.

  For more information on running memory-resident
  applications after starting Windows, see Chapter 7, "Non-
  Windows Applications," in the "Microsoft Windows User's
  Guide."

<P>
o Olivetti Olinet-LM, version 2.0 or earlier
<P>
o Ungermann-Bass Net/One LM, versions 1.1 through 2.0
<P>
The updating procedure differs, depending on which version
of LAN Manager you are using. Follow the instructions for
the version you have. If you are not sure which version
you have, see the following section.
<P>
<P>
6.1.1. Determining Which Version You Are Using
<P>
To determine which version you are using, type the following
at the command prompt:
<P>
net config workstation
<P>
If you see information about your configuration, you have an
Enhanced version. This information indicates whether you
have Enhanced version 2.x or Enhanced version 1.x.
<P>
If you receive an error message when you type the command,
you have a Basic version. To find out whether you have Basic
version 2.x or Basic version 1.x, check the creation dates
of the files in your LAN Manager directory (typically
C:\\LANMAN.DOS\BASIC). If the files are dated before July
1990, you have version 1.x. Files dated after July 1990 are
typically version 2.0; files dated after July 1991 are
typically version 2.1.
<P>
Note: If you installed 3Com 3+Share with minimal NetBIOS
<PRE>      implementation, do one of the following:
      - Reinstall with a complete NetBIOS implementation.
      - Copy the REDIR.400 file to replace the MSREDIR.EXE

<PRE>  LAN Manager. Choose the Microsoft LAN Manager option when
  running the Windows and MS-DOS Setup program. Setup should
  correctly identify your network and the proper version
  number.

</PRE>In addition:
<P>
If you are using an Ungermann-Bass network card with any
network, including networks not produced by Ungermann-Bass,
your system may not run correctly in 386 enhanced mode
unless you have the proper settings in your SYSTEM.INI file.
<P>
If you experience problems, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Open your SYSTEM.INI file by using a text editor such
   as Notepad. SYSTEM.INI is located in your Windows
   directory.

<P><LI>Find or add the [386Enh] section in the file.
<P>
   If you're using Notepad, you can find this section by
   choosing Find from the Search menu, typing [386Enh], and
   then choosing the OK button.

<P><LI>Find or add the TimerCriticalSection=10000 line in
   this section.

<P><LI>Save your SYSTEM.INI file.

<P><LI>Quit and restart Windows.
<P>
<P>
</OL>6.2.2. Using the Ungermann-Bass XNS Transport Stack
<P>
If you are using the Ungermann-Bass XNS transport stack and
running Windows in 386 enhanced mode, you must make sure the
transport stack is not using expanded memory. If your system
is configured to provide expanded memory with a memory
manager such as EMM386, you can disable that product's
expanded-memory option. Or, if you want to continue using
expanded memory, you can disable its use by using the
Ungermann-Bass transport stack as follows:

<OL><P><LI>Open your PROTOCOL.INI file by using a text editor
   such as Windows Notepad. PROTOCOL.INI is located in your
   LAN Manager directory.

<P><LI>Find the section [XNS_XIF].
<P>
   If you're using Notepad, you can find this section by
   choosing Find from the Search menu, typing [XNS_XIF], and
   then choosing the OK button.

<P><LI>Add a line NOEMM, or, if the line already exists,
   make sure that it is not commented out with a semicolon
   (;) at the beginning of the line.

<P><LI>Save your PROTOCOL.INI file.

<P><LI>Restart your workstation.
<P>
<P>
</OL>6.2.3. Using LAN Manager and Expanded Memory
<P>
If you are running Windows in 386 enhanced mode, it is
recommended that you not use expanded memory with LAN
Manager. If you do, you may find that your system slows down
considerably or it may lock up occasionally. If this is a
problem, turn off the use of expanded memory by modifying
your LANMAN.INI and PROTOCOL.INI files. The exact procedure
will vary depending on what components you are running. See
your LAN Manager documentation for further details.

<OL><P><LI>Open your LANMAN.INI file by using a text editor such
   as Notepad. LANMAN.INI is located in your LAN Manager
   directory.

<P><LI>Find or add the section [workstation].
<P>
   If you're using Notepad, you can find this section by
   choosing Find from the Search menu, typing [workstation],
   and then choosing the OK button.

<P><LI>Find or add the LIM= line in this section, and then
   edit it to read:
<P>
   LIM=NO

<P><LI>Save your LANMAN.INI file.

<P><LI>Restart your workstation.
<P>
</OL>Or you can stop your workstation and restart it again using
the net stop workstation and net start workstation commands.
<P>
In addition, you may want to configure other network
components (such as protocol stacks) to avoid using expanded
memory. Consult your network documentation for the specific
component for instructions on how to do this.
<P>
<P>
6.2.4. Using Pop-up Services
<P>
LAN Manager Enhanced includes pop-up services you can use to
see incoming broadcast messages. These pop-up services can
disrupt the Windows screen display, so you must either
disable them or run the LAN Manager WinPopup utility so they
can coexist with Windows.
<P>
The WinPopup utility should be located in your LAN Manager
NETPROG directory, included in your path. To automatically
start the utility when you start Windows, include the
following entry in the [windows] section of your WIN.INI:
<P>
load=winpopup.exe
<P>
If you set up Windows for use with LAN Manager version 2.0
or 2.1 Enhanced, the Windows part of Setup adds this line to
your WIN.INI file. If you are running LAN Manager 1.x
Enhanced, you must insert this line yourself. See WININI.WRI
for information on modifying your WIN.INI file. If you are
using LAN Manager 1.x, you also need to obtain an updated
version of NETPOPUP.EXE from your network dealer.
<P>
Note: Windows version 3.1 includes an updated version of
<PRE>      the WinPopup utility. This utility may not be
      compatible with all networks that are based on
      Microsoft LAN Manager. If you are running AT&amp;T/NCR
      StarGroup LAN Manager version 2.0 Release 3.5, you
      should use the WNETMSG utility provided instead of
      WinPopup.

</PRE></OL>Alternatively, if you want to disable the pop-up services,
use the following procedure:

<OL><P><LI>Find your LAN Manager root directory.

<P><LI>Use Notepad to open the LANMAN.INI file, and locate
   the line that begins with WRKSERVICES=.

<P><LI>Remove the NETPOPUP or MINIPOP entry from this line.
<P>
   If you remove the netpopup and minipop entries but leave
   the messenger entry, messages will still be received but
   will be recorded in the MESSAGES.LOG file in your LAN
   Manager directory rather than being displayed on the
   screen. If you do not want to log your messages, you can
   also remove the messenger entry from this same line.

<P><LI>Save the file.

<P><LI>Quit Windows, and then restart your workstation.
<P>
<P>
</OL>6.2.5. LAN Manager Basic
<P>
When you set up Windows for use with LAN Manager Basic (all
versions), the following entry is added to the [386Enh]
section of your SYSTEM.INI file:
<P>
network=*dosnet, *vnetbios, lanman10.386
<P>
See the SYSINI.WRI file for more information on this entry.
<P>
Network software based on LAN Manager Basic, or on LAN
Manager Enhanced without full API support, must not be
loaded in the high memory area (the first 64K of extended
memory).
<P>
You need to modify the LANMAN.INI file in your network
directory to prevent the network from loading in the HMA.
Find all lines that begin with REDIR and add the following
command-line option to each:
<P>
/HIMEM:NO
<P>
<P>
6.2.6. LAN Manager 1.x
<P>
Some early copies of LAN Manager 1.x require a maintenance
upgrade to run with Windows. If you experience problems,
contact your network vendor for an upgrade.
<P>
<P>
6.2.7. LAN Manager 2.0 Enhanced
<P>
When you set up Windows for use with LAN Manager 2.0
Enhanced, the following entry is added to the [386Enh]
section of your SYSTEM.INI file:
<P>
network=*vnetbios, *dosnet
<P>
See the SYSINI.WRI file for more information on this entry.
<P>
For Windows to support LAN Manager 2.0 Enhanced, you must
have the files NETAPI.DLL, PMSPL.DLL, LANMAN.DRV,
LANMAN.HLP, WINPOPUP.EXE, and WINPOPUP.HLP. These files are
located in your LAN Manager NETPROG directory, which should
be in your path. Windows also includes updated versions of
these files, which will be automatically installed on some
older versions of LAN Manager.
<P>
<P>
6.2.8. LAN Manager 2.1 Basic
<P>
If you upgrade from an earlier version of LAN Manager Basic
to version 2.1 Basic using the Over-the-Network Upgrade
process, your SYSTEM.INI and WIN.INI files may be left with
incorrect information. This will only happen if your upgrade
procedure has been configured to update Windows
installations.
<P>
This problem will cause you to receive a warning that
"WinPopup" cannot be found, and all network functions in
Windows File Manager, Print Manager, and Control Panel will
be unavailable.
<P>
To correct this problem, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Open your WIN.INI file by using a text editor such as
   Notepad. WIN.INI is located in your Windows directory.

<P><LI>Find or add the load= line in the file.
<P>
   If you're using Notepad, you can find this section by
   choosing Find from the Search menu, typing load=, and then
   choosing the OK button.

<P><LI>Remove the word WinPopup or WinPopup.exe from this
   line.

<P><LI>Save your WIN.INI file.

<P><LI>Quit Windows.

<P><LI>Change to the Windows directory.

<P><LI>Start Windows Setup by typing setup at the MS-DOS
   prompt.

<P><LI>Choose the Network entry to display a list of network
   options.

<P><LI>Choose the option Microsoft LAN Manager (version 2.1
   Basic).

<P><LI>Choose to accept the configuration shown.

<P><LI>Restart Windows.
<P>
<P>
</OL>6.2.9. LAN Manager 2.1 Enhanced
<P>
When you set up Windows for use with LAN Manager 2.1
Enhanced, the following entry is added to the [boot] section
of your SYSTEM.INI file:
<P>
Network.drv=lanman21.drv
<P>
See the SYSINI.WRI file for more information on this entry.
<P>
For Windows to support LAN Manager 2.1 Enhanced, you must
have the files NETAPI.DLL, PMSPL.DLL, LANMAN21.DRV,
LM21_W31.HLP, WINPOPUP.EXE, and WINPOPUP.HLP. These files
are usually located in your LAN Manager NETPROG directory,
which is on your path. If Windows cannot find any of these
files, you may receive warning messages when starting
Windows, or be unable to use Windows network functions.
<P>
Note: Customers can obtain the latest Lanman21.drv from the Microsoft
Download (MSDL) service. The following information pertains to the MSDL
service:
<P>
<PRE>     Number: (425) 936-MSDL
     Baud: 1200, 2400, 9600, 14000
     Settings: N,8,1.
     Protocols: X - XMODEM
