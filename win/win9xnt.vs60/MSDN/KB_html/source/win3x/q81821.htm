The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When a program is started using the run= line in the WIN.INI file, or
by placing its name on the command line that starts Windows, Program
Manager starts minimized. When Program Manager is restored, Program
Manager does not come up maximized, even if it was maximized when you
last exited Windows and saved changes.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
The only workaround at this time is to save the changes with Program
Manager in a non-maximized state, but with the borders pulled out as
far as possible.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows version 3.0. This
problem was corrected and does not occur in later versions of Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The WIN.INI file has a run= line, on which program executable filenames
can be placed. For example:
<P>
<PRE>   run=c:\winword\winword.exe c:\windows\calendar.exe

</PRE>The programs listed on this line are then started automatically as if
they had been started by double-clicking their icons or starting them
by choosing Run from the File menu. The same thing occurs if the program is
started by including its name on the command line that starts Windows. For
example:
<P>
<PRE>   win winword

</PRE>This is as opposed to using the load= line in the WIN.INI file where the
programs start minimized as icons on the desktop. One consequence of
starting programs on the run= line or the command line is that Program
Manager is minimized regardless of whether or not Minimize On Use is
selected in the Options menu of Program Manager.
<P>
If the Program Manager is then restored by double-clicking its icon,
it returns in a non-maximized state. This occurs even if, when the you
last exited Windows, Program Manager was maximized and the changes
were saved.
<P>
The state of Program Manager, minimized, maximized, or restored (open
as a Window but not maximized) is recorded in the PROGMAN.INI file in
the [Settings] section. The line appears as follows
<P>
<PRE>   Window=vv ww xxx yyy z

</PRE>where z can be either 1, 2, or 3. This number determines the state
Program Manager is in when Windows starts. Restored is represented by 1,
minimized by 2, and maximized by 3. If the number is 3, Program Manager
starts maximized unless a program is started on the run= line in the
WIN.INI file or by putting its executable filename on the command line that
starts Windows.
<P>
When the program starts, Program Manager is minimized. When you double-
click on its icon, Program Manager displays in a window but is not
maximized. The value in the PROGMAN.INI file, however, is not changed.
It is still 3.
