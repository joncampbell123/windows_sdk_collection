The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.1, 3.11
<LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you start Windows or Windows for Workgroups on a computer with a Sony
CDU 55e IDE CD-ROM drive installed, you may receive a blue screen with the
following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   This program tried to access your hard disk in a way that is
   incompatible with Window's 32-bit disk-access feature (*wdctrl).

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When the Sony CDU 55e IDE CD-ROM drive is installed as a "slave" to the
"master" hard disk and 32-bit disk access is enabled, the CD-ROM drive uses
the same primary IDE channel as the hard disk. The CD-ROM drive shares the
hard disk's cable, interrupt, and port (IRQ 14, 1F0h).
<P>
Because this CD-ROM drive does not meet the WD1003 specification, the
master hard disk loses 32-bit disk access capabilities and the WDCTRL
driver does not load.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, use either of the following methods:

<UL><LI>Move the CD-ROM drive to a secondary IDE channel on the controller
   card. Note that this method requires using separate cables for the
   hard disk and CD-ROM drive.
<P>
   For information about configuring the hardware in your computer,
   please consult the hardware documentation or manufacturer.

<LI>Disable 32-bit disk access. To do so, double-click the 386 Enhanced
   icon in Control Panel, click the Virtual Memory button, click the
   Change button, then clear the 32-Bit Disk Access check box.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Sony CDU 55e CD-ROM drive is typically bundled with a Future Domain
16003 IDE controller and is installed on the secondary IDE channel by
default using IRQ 15 and port 170h.
<P>
Sony's Setup program puts the ATAPI_CD.SYS driver in the CONFIG.SYS file
and Corel's CORELCDX.EXE CD-ROM extension in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file. The
CD-ROM drive works with either CORELCDX.EXE or MSCDEX.EXE, but both will
fail if the CD-ROM drive is installed as a slave and 32-bit disk access is
enabled.
<P>
Using an enhanced IDE controller instead of a standard IDE controller does
not solve the problem under current versions of MS-DOS and Windows. Also,
using third-party 32-bit disk access drivers (such as those from OnTrack,
Western Digital, or MicroHouse) does not solve the problem.
