The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you quit Windows for Workgroups 3.11, you may receive the following
error message:
<P>
<PRE>   There are 1 user(s) connected to your computer. Quitting Windows for
   Workgroups will disconnect them. Do you want to continue?

</PRE>When you run Net Watcher, you find a connection to your machine, even if
you do not have any shared resources. The machine name is displayed in the
left side of the Net Watcher window, but no shares are displayed in the
right side of the Net Watcher window.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Such connections are part of the browsing system. The connections typically
exist only for a few seconds and occur when your machine has been selected
as the browse master or browser backup. You are more likely to notice this
problem if you are using a slower 80386 machine.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Machines appear in Net Watcher when a machine has connected to the IPC$
share, which is the share to which browse masters from other domains and
browser backups connect in order to get the name of browser backups and the
current list of machines on the workgroup or domain. Although this
connection usually lasts only second before being terminated, the
connection may last longer on very large networks.
