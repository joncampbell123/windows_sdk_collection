<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes the naming conventions for network interface
cards (NICs) manufactured by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC).
These conventions are used to identify various information about the
network cards, including the class, architecture, and connections of
the card.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
DEC NICs are stamped with a product number on the bracket. (For
example, the DEC Etherworks Turbo/TP has the product number DE201.)
This number is visible from the back of the computer. The meaning of
the different name and number mappings are as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   DE10x - Etherworks LC
   DE20x - Etherworks Turbo
   DE21x - Etherworks MC

</PRE>NOTE: "DE" indicates a DEC Etherworks card.
<P>
The number in the first position (1, 2, or 4) indicates the class of
the network card. The classes are as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   1 - Standard
   2 - Turbo
   4 - EISA

</PRE>The number in the middle position (0, 1, or 2) indicates the bus
architecture as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   0 - ISA
   1 - Microchannel
   2 - EISA

</PRE>The number in the last position ("x") indicates the type of connectors
on the card and the card name as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   0 - AUI and BNC
   1 - AUI and TP
   2 - BNC and TP

</PRE>Originally, DEC manufactured a card with the name "DEPCA." This card
was an 8-bit net/mouse full-length card. It had a connector for the
mouse and a BNC connector only for the network connection on the card.
<P>
Since this card was produced, all network cards subsequently produced
by DEC have been supersets of this original DEPCA card. These cards
all use the same NDIS driver (DEPCA.DOS) and therefore have been
erroneously called "DEPCA" cards. All DEC cards excluding the original
DEPCA card has been given a product name and a product number as
described above.
