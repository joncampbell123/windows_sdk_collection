<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If an application workspace has been resized to be quite small, any
modeless dialogs that are generated by the program may be clipped by
the boundaries of the workspace window, making it difficult to see or
access various fields and/or buttons.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Modeless dialogs allow you to access the application's menu bar, tool
bar, and other documents opened by the application, without closing
the dialog first. This generally allows a function or command to be
applied to a number of different documents. A typical use for a
modeless dialog would be a spell-checker dialog, such as the one used
by PowerPoint for Windows.
<P>
If modeless dialogs are implemented so that their parent window is the
application window, the dialog must be contained within the boundaries
of that application window. In addition, they may be implemented in
such a way that they are actually treated like an open document in a
MDI (multiple document interface) application, and appear under the
application's Window menu along with the other open-document windows.
