<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The portable Zenith MastersPort may have mouse problems after reviving
from its rest feature when running Microsoft Windows operating system
version 3.1 with a bus mouse.
<P>
An update for the Zenith Flash BIOS is available on CompuServe in the
Zenith forum (GO ZENITH) or by contacting any Zenith dealer. The file
on CompuServe is called MPSL3.EXE and is in the library section. This
file is compressed and self-extracting.
<P>
Any questions regarding the file MPSL3.EXE or the BIOS update should be
directed to Zenith Data Systems at (800) 227-3360.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The MastersPort can shut itself down to preserve battery power. Once
the machine is reactivated, a software program will continue where it
left off. However, if Windows version 3.1 is running with a bus mouse,
the mouse will either be frozen on the screen or "rubber banded" to
the screen border (that is, when the mouse is moved, it will jerk back
to the border as if it were attached to it with a rubber band).
<P>
The MastersPort is manufactured by a vendor independent of Microsoft;
we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
performance or reliability.
