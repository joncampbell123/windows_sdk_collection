The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you try to access a connected network drive from the MS-DOS command
prompt using Windows for Workgroups 3.11 and Novell NetWare connectivity,
you may receive the following message:
<P>
<PRE>  Extended Error 53

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This error message occurs because the real-mode network, when running
Novell NetWare connectivity, cannot load the same protocols that load in
386 enhanced mode Windows for Workgroups 3.11. Because the real-mode
network is using the IPX or IPXODI driver to communicate with the network
adapter, it cannot load the NDIS2 or NDIS3 protocols. However, it does
allow communication with any Windows for Workgroups 3.11 server running the
IPX/SPX Compatible Transport or IPX/SPX Compatible Transport with NetBIOS
on the network.
<P>
It is not possible to access a Windows for Workgroups 3.1 server because it
cannot use the IPX/SPX compatible protocol. Communication with a Windows NT
server is also not possible because the real-mode network does not provide
the NetBIOS interface necessary to communicate with the Windows NT IPX/SPX
Compatible Transport.
<P>
If persistent connections are stored in Windows for Workgroups 3.11 and
ghosted connections are enabled, starting the real-mode network in MS-DOS
will seem to connect machines not running the IPX/SPX compatible protocol,
including Windows for Workgroups 3.1 and Windows NT servers. However, if
you try to access files or printers on these servers, you receive the error
message "Extended Error 53." This occurs because ghosted connections have
been enabled in Windows for Workgroups 3.11 and therefore no attempt is
made to connect to the server when the real-mode network is first started.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Communication is not possible with a Windows for Workgroups 3.1 or Windows
NT server using the real-mode redirector in conjunction with Novell NetWare
connectivity. If you need to access another Windows for Workgroups 3.11
machine, the computer you are trying to connect to must be running Windows
for Workgroups 3.11 and must have the IPX/SPX Compatible Transport (either
with or without NetBIOS) installed as a protocol.
