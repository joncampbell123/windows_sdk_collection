The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When Windows for Workgroups 3.11 is installed with DEC Pathworks configured
as the primary network, you may receive the following error message when
you start Windows:
<P>
<PRE>   System Error  --  Network error on drive x

</PRE>where &lt;x&gt; is the drive letter connecting a DEC Pathworks server.
<P>
After you choose Cancel a number of times, you may be able to proceed into
Windows for Workgroups. However, if you try to access a DEC Pathworks
server drive from File Manager, you receive the following message
<P>
<PRE>   An error occurred reading drive D:

</PRE>or, if you try to access a DEC Pathworks drive from the MS-DOS Prompt
in Windows, you receive the following Pathworks error message:
<P>
<PRE>   NET804:  Network busy - remote node not responding

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Primary networks, including Microsoft LAN Manager, Artisoft LANtastic, and
DEC Pathworks, may use some network drivers that are incompatible with the
IFSHLP.SYS device driver that is loaded with Windows for Workgroups 3.11.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To properly run Windows for Workgroups 3.11 with one of these networks as a
primary network, you must remove the IFSHLP.SYS device driver from the
CONFIG.SYS file.
<P>
NOTE: If IFSHLP.SYS is not loaded, 32-bit file access is not available.
<P>
You may also be able to workaround this problem by obtaining the
integration kit for Windows for Workgroups provided by DEC. It allows DEC
Pathworks and the Windows for Workgroups 3.11 network functionality to
coexist by setting up DECNET as a protocol on an existing Windows for
Workgroups installation. IFSHLP.SYS does not need to be removed with this
installation. For more information, contact DEC technical support, or the
DECPCI forum on CompuServe.
