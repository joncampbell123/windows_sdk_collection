The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After you install version 3.0 or later of the retail version of Microsoft
Mail or the version of Microsoft Mail that ships with Windows for
Workgroups version 3.11 over the older version of Mail shipped with Windows
for Workgroups 3.1, you receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   This version of Mail is too old to access your message file.

</PRE>NOTE: Choosing OK closes Mail.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
NOTE: This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft
DriveSpace. For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands
and filenames.
<P>
In Windows for Workgroups version 3.11, you can use two different types of
compression on the Mail message file (.MMF): DoubleSpace Security or
Highest Security. The difference between these is the encryption method
employed. The DoubleSpace option is less heavily encrypted and allows
DoubleSpace to compress the file on a DoubleSpace volume.
<P>
The aforementioned error message can occur when you are using Windows for
Workgroups version 3.11 if DoubleSpace Security is enabled rather than
Highest Security. Windows for Workgroups Mail 3.1 and the retail version of
Microsoft Mail cannot read the Windows for Workgroups 3.11 .MMF because
they cannot read the DoubleSpace encryption method.
<P>
To use Windows for Workgroups Mail version 3.1 or the retail version of
Microsoft Mail, you must use the Highest Security method.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To change the encryption method, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Rename the current MSMAIL.EXE to MSMAIL.SAV. This file is usually found
   in the Windows directory although it is possible for it to be located in
   another directory.

<P><LI>Expand the file MSMAIL.EX_ from your original Windows for Workgroups
   version 3.11 disks. At an MS-DOS command prompt, change to your Windows
   directory, and type the following command
<P>
<P><PRE>      expand &lt;drive&gt;:\msmail.ex_ &lt;destination&gt;:\windows\msmail.exe
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;drive&gt; is the floppy disk drive containing your original Windows
   for Workgroups disk and &lt;destination&gt; is the drive containing Windows.
<P>
   NOTE: This file is located on Disk 2 of the 1.2-MB 5.25-inch disk set
   and Disk 3 of the 1.44-MB 3.5-inch disk set.

<P><LI>Start MSMAIL.EXE from the Windows directory.

<P><LI>From the Mail menu, choose Options. Change DoubleSpace Security to
   Highest Security.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Exit And Sign Out.

<P><LI>Delete the MSMAIL.EXE file that you expanded in step 2--it is no longer
   required.

<P><LI>Rename the saved copy of the mail executable MSMAIL.SAV to MSMAIL.EXE.

<P><LI>Restart Mail.
<P>
</OL>If the compression options listed are missing, check to see if the
MSMAIL.EXE file being used was in the Windows directory. If MSMAIL.EXE was
being called from a different location, run Mail from the Windows directory
and repeat the above steps.
<P>
NOTE: The physical size of the .MMF does not change as a result of changing
the encryption method; however, a progress bar is displayed at the bottom
of the Mail screen during the conversion process. This conversion process
takes approximately 10 to 15 seconds per megabyte of .MMF size.
<P>
If Microsoft Mail cannot convert the .MMF to Highest Security but still
functions when you are using Windows for Workgroups version 3.11, proceed
as follows:

<OL><P><LI>Run Microsoft Mail, and choose Export Folder from the File menu.

<P><LI>Export all folders to another file (for example, EXPORT.MMF).

<P><LI>Rename the MSMAIL.MMF file to MSMAIL.OLD.

<P><LI>Run the retail version of Microsoft Mail or Windows for Workgroups
   version 3.10 Mail.

<P><LI>When prompted for the location of the .MMF, select the exported file
   (for example, EXPORT.MMF).
<P>
   A message informing you that this is a backup message file should
   appear. Choose OK to convert this exported .MMF to the active .MMF for
   Mail.

<P><LI>Mail should then function normally.
<P></OL>
