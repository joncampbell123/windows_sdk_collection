<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
You may receive the following error message during the setup of Microsoft
Windows version 3.0:
<P>
<PRE>   Setup cannot modify your SYSTEM.INI. Delete WINVER.EXE and
   re-install Windows

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This indicates that SETUP.EXE cannot modify or create the SYSTEM.INI file.
However, you can't delete the WINVER.EXE file because it hasn't been
created yet. The error message can be caused by the following:

<UL><LI>Making backups (DISKCOPY.COM) off of the original Windows 3.0
   installation disks.

<LI>Disk 1 of the Windows installation disks is corrupted.

<LI>The computer system you are installing on has TSR
   (terminate-and-stay-resident) software, an improper configuration,
   or a similar problem.
<P>
</UL><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
Follow these troubleshooting steps:

<OL><P><LI>Delete all the related Windows 3.0 files in the directory where
   Windows was partially installed.

<P><LI>Remove any TSR software from the AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS files.

<P><LI>Re-install off of the original disks if the backups were used
   for the corrupted installation or copy (do not use the DISKCOPY.COM
   file) the original files to preformatted disks and install from them.

<P><LI>If Disk 1 is corrupted, replace the disk and follow steps 1-3. To
   obtain a replacement disk, call Microsoft Product Support Services
   at (425) 637-7098.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The file SYSTEM.SRC is copied from the setup disks and renamed to
SYSTEM.INI during Windows setup. If Windows SETUP.EXE cannot update
the new SYSTEM.INI file with drivers and parameters, you will receive
the above error message.
<P>
You can tell that the SYSTEM.SRC file is corrupted when you try to
expand the file and get an error message indicating that this file
is already expanded. The SYSTEM.SRC file is located on Disk 1 and has
a compressed file size of 470 bytes. The expanded size should be
790 to 791 bytes in size.
<P>
If you do expand the SYSTEM.SRC file, load this file into a text editor
(such as Notepad) and verify that the file is complete with no strange
characters or missing sections. It is normal for some sections (such as
the Nonwindowsapp and Standard sections) to have no entries under them.
It is also normal that some drivers will have no entries for them.
