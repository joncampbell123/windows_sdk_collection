<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Three different digitizing technologies currently exist that meet the
requirements for Windows for Pen Computing. These technologies are
resistive, electrostatic, and electromagnetic. The digitizing technology
must work effectively with an LCD screen, it must protect the LCD polarized
surface, and it should accurately simulate the sense of pen and paper.
Also, handwriting recognition software requires that the digitizer
resolution be at least 250 dots/inch or greater. The resistive,
electrostatic, and electromagnetic technologies meet all of these
requirements.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Resistive Digitizers</h3>
 
<P>
Resistive technologies basically consists of a single or a double
layer of transparent conductive sheets spread over a protective glass
surface that lies above the top polarizing layer of the LCD screen.
The double-layered version relies on membrane touch-panel technology.
The pen causes the two sheets to make contact, and the currents are
measured for an x and y coordinate of the pen position. The single
layer version requires a tethered pen to conduct current through the
single transparent sheet.
<P>
The two-layer resistive digitizing technology is relatively
inexpensive and it is easy to implement on an LCD system. However, it
has several drawbacks. The two conductive sheets on top of the LCD
screen reduce brightness more than any of the other digitizing
methods. Also, the two sheets, which are separated by spacers, are
easily influenced by temperature and humidity in such a way as to
adversely affect the uniform resistivity of the conductive sheets. As
a result, the positional measurements for the pen are less accurate.
Similar, though less pronounced problems, occur with the
single-conductive-layer resistive digitizer design. A final flaw with
both versions of the resistive digitizing technology is that it does
not allow for proximity sensing of the pen.
<P>
Normally, pen development standards would expect the pen to register
when the pen is close but not touching the pen writing surface, but
this feature is not available with resistive digitizers.
<P>
<P><h3>Electrostatic/Capacitive Digitizers</h3>
 
<P>
Electrostatic or capacitive digitizers require a tethered pen, and a
transparent conductive layer must be deposited on the underside of the
protective glass shield. In this way, when the pen comes close to the
surface of the glass, the electronic signal in the pen creates a
capacitive effect with the conductive sheet on the underside of the
glass. Relative current measurements determine the x and y coordinate
position of the pen.
<P>
The electrostatic/capacitive digitizer has an advantage over resistive
digitizers because it implements proximity sensing for the pen. Not
only can the electrostatic method provide information about pen
position above the writing surface, but it also provides information
about pen height as well as pen tilt. The disadvantages of the
electrostatic/capacitive digitizer is that it requires a tethered pen,
and it reduces optical transmissions to about the same degree as the
single-layer resistive technique (that is, the transparent conductive
layer reduces LCD transmission by about 15 percent).
<P>
<P><h3>Electromagnetic Digitizers</h3>
 
<P>
The electromagnetic digitizer relies on a series of looped coils on a
sensor board beneath the LCD screen. A magnetic field is created
through the coils. The pen may either reflect these electromagnetic
waves back to the sensor board by its own coil inside of the pen, or
the pen is tethered and will send back its own signal. Pen position is
determined by measuring the magnetic signal from the pen relative to
the position of the sensor board coils under the LCD.
<P>
The main advantage that the electromagnetic digitizer has over the
other two technologies is that it does not interfere with the optical
transmission of the LCD. Because the sensor board is behind the LCD
screen, only a protective clear glass layer needs to be placed above
the top of the LCD display panel. A disadvantage of the
electromagnetic system is that it requires the "light-pipe" design for
backlighting. This method of backlighting requires that the light
source be placed at the side of the LCD screen rather than directly
behind the screen. Additionally the electromagnetic digitizer requires
that a magnetic shield be placed between the sensor board and the
system motherboard. Examples of currently released products that use
the electromagnetic digitizing technique are the NCR 3125 clipboard,
the WACOM 648A tablet, and the WACOM 510C tablets.
