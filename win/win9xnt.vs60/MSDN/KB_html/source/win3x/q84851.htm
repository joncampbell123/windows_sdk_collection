The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
You may not be able to set up Microsoft Windows version 3.1 on a hard drive
that was partitioned with Konan TenTimes HD controller software. When
running Windows 3.1 Setup, the installation may fail or lock up when
switching from character-based Setup to graphics-mode Setup.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Konan TenTimes HD controller Setup program (TENSETUP.EXE) will
normally low-level format, partition, and high-level format the drive.
The drive then requires the device driver TENTIME.SYS be loaded from
the CONFIG.SYS file to properly access any drive higher than drive C
(for example, drive D, E, and so on).
<P>
Windows 3.1 Setup program will not be able to complete normally if the
hard drive was formatted using the TenTimes partitioning method.
<P>
TenTimes has confirmed this to be a problem with its partitioning
software. For additional information, please contact TenTimes at (602)
940-9800.
<P>
There is an option in the TenTimes Setup program to perform a standard
MS-DOS partition and format of the hard drive. According to TenTimes,
if the drive is partitioned and formatted this way, Windows 3.1 should
install and function correctly. Note: This has not been tested yet by
TenTimes or Microsoft.
<P>
Additional information will be posted here as it becomes available.
<P>
The TenTimes product included here is manufactured by a vendor
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise,
regarding this product's performance or reliability.
