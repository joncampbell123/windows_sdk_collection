The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
The following article contains information on the use of Windows for
Workgroups with third-party products or configurations that have not
been tested and are not supported by Microsoft.
<P>
If the steps or procedures described in this article do not function
properly, contact the manufacturer of the third-party product for more
information or use a supported configuration.
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you use hDC Windows Express 3.0 as the Windows shell with Microsoft
Windows for Workgroups, the following errors may occur:

<UL><LI>The LOAD= and RUN= lines in the WIN.INI file may not run correctly.

<LI>Closing Windows Express may not end the current Windows session.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Because of the differences between the shell logic used in Windows
Express and Windows for Workgroups, Windows Express loads itself as a
normal application without establishing a Windows shell. Because no
shell has been established, the only way to end the Windows session is
to restart (reboot) the computer.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, use Program Manager as the Windows shell
and do one of the following to run Windows Express:

<UL><LI>Use Windows Program Manager to Add an icon for Windows Express to
   the StartUp group.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Add EXPRESS to the RUN= line in your WIN.INI file.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you use Windows Express version 3.0 as the Windows shell, it
expects to be started before all other Windows applications. However,
when you use this application with Windows for Workgroups, Windows
Express cannot be started first because Windows for Workgroups starts
two hidden applications (NETDDE.EXE and CLIPSRV.EXE) prior to loading
Windows Express.
<P>
This feature is by design.
<P>
For additional information about Windows Express, contact hDC Computer
Corporation.
