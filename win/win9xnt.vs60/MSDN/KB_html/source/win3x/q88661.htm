The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11
</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The IBM PS/1 series computer runs Microsoft Windows, and is similar to
other ISA-compatible computers. This article discusses the following
issues:

<UL><LI>The PS/1 should be configured to boot from the hard drive
<LI>Windows should not be started from the SHELLSTB.COM menu
<LI>Configuring the PS/1 Printer (model 2205) in Windows 3.0 and 3.0a
<LI>MSD.EXE and the PS/1
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>The PS/1 Should Be Configured to Boot from the Hard Drive</h3>
 
<P>
The IBM PS/1 series computer can be configured to boot either from system
ROMs or the hard drive. For Windows to load HIMEM.SYS and function
correctly, the computer must boot from the hard drive.
<P>
There are two ways to make the PS/1 boot from drive D so that HIMEM.SYS is
loaded.

<UL><LI>Customize the boot process:
<P>
   1. From the PS/1 main menu, choose the IBM DOS option.
<P>
   2. Select "Customize how the system starts from the DOS Shell."
<P>
<P><PRE>      When you select this option, the PS/1 does not boot directly
      from drive C, and the default PS/1 menu no longer appears.
      (See the next section of this article for information about
      this menu.)
</PRE><P>
   3. Press ENTER to save changes and restart the PS/1.
<P>
   NOTE: In some cases, disabling the ROMs and booting from the hard
   drive may not work. (This problem is usually caused by a bad or
   missing COMMAND.COM file.) If the system doesn't restart, hold
   down both mouse buttons to force the machine to boot from the ROM
   again.
<P>
   For more information, refer to pages 78-81 in the "IBM PS/1 User's
   Reference for the PS/1 Computer."

<LI>Press ALT+PRINT SCREEN. This forces the computer to restart using
   drive C. This is a short-term solution; as soon as the computer is
   turned off and back on again, it starts from the ROMs again.
<P>
</UL>If you are installing Windows 3.1 to a PS/1 started from ROMs, you
may receive an error message about not being able to update your system
files. To correct this problem:

<OL><P><LI>Configure the PS/1 to boot from the hard drive.

<P><LI>Update the system files used to boot, using the COPY command by
   typing the following at the MS-DOS command prompt (press ENTER
   after each line):
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy c:\windows\config.win c:\config.sys
      copy c:\windows\autoexec.win c:\autoexec.bat
</PRE><P>
</OL><h3>Windows Should Not Be Started from SHELLSTB.COM Menu</h3>
 
<P>
When you boot from a PS/1 hard drive, many PS/1s load a terminate-and-stay-
resident (TSR) menu program called SHELLSTB.COM. Microsoft does not
recommend that you operate Windows from this menu.
<P>
This file can be installed in CONFIG.SYS or loaded in AUTOEXEC.BAT. Be sure
to remark out SHELLSTB.COM from both files, and then restart your computer.
<P>
NOTE: If you don't disable this line before starting Windows, Windows
operates from the IBM PS/1 menu. To confirm this, exit Windows to PC-DOS,
and then type "exit" (without the quotation marks) and pressing ENTER. You
are then in the PS/1 menu.
<P>
<P><h3>Configuring the PS/1 Printer (model 2205) in Windows 3.0, 3.0a</h3>
 
<P>
Windows versions 3.0 and 3.0a do not come with a driver for the PS/1
printer. This printer should be set up as an IBM Proprinter X24E in
Windows. Windows 3.1 does come with a driver for the PS/1 printer.
<P>
<P><h3>MSD.EXE and the PS/1</h3>
 
<P>
MSD.EXE may stop responding (hang) when run on a PS/1 that is running LAN
Manager 2.1.
