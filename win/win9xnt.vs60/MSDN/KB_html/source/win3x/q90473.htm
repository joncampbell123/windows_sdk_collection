<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Comm Server is a LAN Manager server-based product that
allows connectivity (over Token Ring) to mainframes from workstations
running the Comm Server client software. The server portion of Comm
Server, which resides on the LAN Manager server, transmits Comm Server
client mainframe sessions (usually 3270 emulation sessions) using
named pipes. The majority of these named pipes are asynchronous.
<P>
This article discusses the use of Comm Server with Windows for
Workgroups and Workgroup Connections redirectors.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Comm Server requires the ability of the redirector to support
asynchronous named pipes. The only redirectors that currently support
this are the Vredir and the Full redirector.
<P>
The Vredir is the preferred redirector to use with Comm Server because
it can handle the multiple asynchronous named pipe requests that Comm
server requires and it frees up more resources than does the Full
redirector.
<P>
The Full redirector does not have enough internal support to satisfy
all the asynchronous requests of the Comm Server. Although the Full
redirector does support asynchronous pipes, it cannot accept multiple
requests at once.
<P>
NOTE: The Full redirector does not support asynchronous named pipes
inside of Windows, but it does support named pipes inside of Windows.
<P>
The Basic redirector does not have named pipe support, and therefore
does not work with Comm Server.
