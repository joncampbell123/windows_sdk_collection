The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the Printer Echo command in Terminal, it does not echo
the commands to the printer immediately.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
If Printer Echo is active, all the information displayed on the screen
is sent to Print Manager to be printed. The spooled data is printed
when the print queue link with Print Manager is closed. This occurs
when you close Terminal, or when you choose Printer Echo from the
Settings menu to deactivate Printer Echo. This is the same process
that all Windows 3.1 applications use to print. The printout consists
of every line and command that is issued within the Terminal session.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
At any time during a Terminal session, you can force the contents that
are being echoed to the printer to start printing by choosing Printer
Echo from the Settings menu again, thereby closing the print job. If
you want to restart capturing data again during the session, choose
Printer Echo again from the Settings menu.
<P>
If Print Manager is disabled, the information and commands displayed
are not spooled; they are immediately sent to the printer.
<P>
NOTE: The buffer is not specifically related to printing. Its function
is to retain a specific number of lines for you to review. The buffer
size can be modified by changing the settings in the dialog box that
appears when you choose Terminal Preferences from the Settings menu.
The minimum number of lines for the buffer is 25; the maximum number
of lines is 400.
