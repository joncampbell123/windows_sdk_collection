The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you run Windows on a Novell NetWare network, check the SET TEMP=
variable for the following:

<UL><LI>You must have both read and write privileges (rights) to the
   directory where the SET TEMP= variable is pointed.

<LI>The above directory must exist and normally be empty when
   Windows is not running.

<LI>You cannot share a TEMP directory with other users.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
After you do a network installation of Windows (SETUP /N) to your local
hard drive, or your user directory on the network, you can either set your
TEMP directory to the local hard drive or subdirectory on the network.
<P>
<P><h3>Local Hard Drive</h3>
 
<P>
If you install your user files on your local hard driver, then the SET
TEMP= should also be set to your local hard drive. You already have
full privileges to it.
<P>
<P><h3>User Directory on Server</h3>
 
<P>
If you have your personal Windows files in your user directory on the
server, then the SET TEMP= can be pointed to a directory on your local
hard drive if you have one, or a TEMP subdirectory under your
user directory. If you use the user directory, make sure you have
read and write privileges to that directory and the TEMP subdirectory.
<P>
You should use the Novell MAP ROOT command in mapping to the user
directory on the server. For more information on this procedure, refer
to the NETWORKS.WRI file shipped with Windows.
<P>
For example, assuming "Robert's" user directory has been map rooted as
M:, and the TEMP directory is under Robert's user directory, then SET
TEMP=M:\TEMP is the proper syntax in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file. If SET
TEMP=F:\USERS\BOB\WINDOWS\TEMP is used, Windows may complain about
insufficient disk space or memory.
<P>
With Windows, it is usually best to have only one drive mapping for
any given directory -- whether it is a mapped drive or a search drive
-- and have only one path to access it.
