</PRE><h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
 
<P>
The WW1000 disk included with this Application Note contains
VSHARE.386 version 3.11.0.402. This version of VSHARE.386 is
compatible with Microsoft Windows version 3.1 and Windows for
Workgroups versions 3.1 and 3.11.
<P>
<PRE>  NOTE: Microsoft Office versions 4.2 and 4.3 install version
  3.11.0.401 of VSHARE.386.

</PRE>The version of VSHARE.386 included with this Application Note differs
from the version included with Windows for Workgroups 3.11 (version
3.11.0.300) in the following ways:

<UL><LI>The version of VSHARE.386 included with this Application Note
   supports Windows version 3.1.

<LI>The version of VSHARE.386 included with this Application Note
   corrects a problem than can cause Windows for Workgroups 3.11 to
   stop responding (hang) when you start your computer.
<P>
</UL><h3>USING VSHARE.386</h3>
 
<P>
If you are using applications that support OLE 2.0, you must run
either SHARE.EXE or VSHARE.386. VSHARE.386 eliminates the need to run
SHARE.EXE when you run Windows 3.1 or Windows for Workgroups in 386
enhanced mode. If you run Windows 3.1 in standard mode, you must run
SHARE.EXE. If you run applications that are not compatible with
SHARE.EXE and you are running Windows 3.1 in 386 enhanced mode, the
applications may work with VSHARE.386 instead of SHARE.EXE.
<P>
<P><h3>INSTALLING THE UPDATED VSHARE.386 FILE</h3>
 
<P>
To install VSHARE.386 version 3.11.0.402, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Quit Windows.

<P><LI>If you received a disk with this Application Note, insert the disk
   in the appropriate floppy disk drive.
<P>
   If you downloaded this Application Note from an online service,
   skip to step 3. This procedure assumes that you have already
   downloaded and extracted the compressed file.

<P><LI>At the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following command and
   then press ENTER
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy &lt;source&gt;:\vshare.386 &lt;location&gt;
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;source&gt; is either the letter of your floppy disk drive or
   the directory containing the file you downloaded from online
   services, and &lt;location&gt; is the path to your Windows\SYSTEM
   subdirectory. For example, if you are installing from a floppy disk
   that you inserted in drive A, and C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM is the path to
   your Windows\SYSTEM subdirectory, type:
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy a:\vshare.386 c:\windows\system
</PRE><P>
   Or, for example, if you downloaded the WW1000.EXE file from online
   services to C:\DOWNLOAD and C:WINDOWS\SYSTEM is the path to your
   Windows\SYSTEM subdirectory, type:
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy c:\download\vshare.386 c:\windows\system
</PRE>
<P><LI>Use any text editor (such as MS-DOS Editor) to edit the
   AUTOEXEC.BAT file. Remove the SHARE.EXE command from the
   AUTOEXEC.BAT file and then save and close the file.

<P><LI>Edit the [386Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file to add the
   following line:
<P>
<P><PRE>      device=vshare.386
</PRE>
<P><LI>Save and then close the SYSTEM.INI file.

<P><LI>Restart your computer.
