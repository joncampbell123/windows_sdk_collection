<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Attempting to load SMARTDrive version 4.0 (SMARTDRV.EXE) as a double-buffer
driver into the upper memory area (UMA) generates the following error
message:
<P>
<PRE>   Double buffering driver cannot be loaded into a UMB. Do not use the
   devicehigh command or other load-high utilities to load
   Smartdrv.exe.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When loaded in the CONFIG.SYS file as a device driver to provide double
buffering, SMARTDRV.EXE must be loaded in conventional or low memory.
Even if a memory manager is present that allows programs to be loaded
into the UMA, SMARTDRV.EXE must be loaded low if it is being used as a
double-buffering device driver.
<P>
NOTE: There is no workaround for this problem.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The double buffering that SMARTDRV.EXE provides is required for
certain Bus Master disk controllers when running in the Virtual 8086
mode of the 80386 and 80486 processors.
<P>
Improved compatibility between Virtual 8086 mode and these older
controllers depends on the fact that the buffer (approximately 2K)
that SMARTDrive uses for the purposes of double buffering loads into
an address that is identical to its location in physical memory.
<P>
386 memory managers, such as EMM386.EXE, allow you to load device
drivers and terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) programs into upper
memory blocks (UMBs) by using the ability of 80386 and 80486
processors to remap addresses between 640K and 1024K into physical
extended memory. Because this reassigning of addresses would prevent
SMARTDRV.EXE's double buffer from residing at an address compatible
with its location in physical memory, SMARTDRV.EXE must remain in
conventional memory.
<P>
NOTE: This information does not apply if you are using SMARTDRV.EXE
version 4.0 as a disk cache in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file. The ability to
provide double buffering is independent of SMARTDRV.EXE's role as a
disk cache. You can load SMARTDRV.EXE with the /double_buffer option
low in the CONFIG.SYS file, and load SMARTDRV.EXE, the disk cache,
high in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file.
<P>
