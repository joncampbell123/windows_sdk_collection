The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11
</UL>

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When switching from a temporary swap file to a permanent swap file,
the following message may be displayed:
<P>
<PRE>   Windows is currently using a temporary swap file located on drive
   C. This may prevent an accurate permanent swap-file analysis.

</PRE>This message indicates Windows cannot correctly recommend a permanent
swap file setting because of the disk space that is being used by the
temporary swap file.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In determining the recommended size for a permanent swap file, Windows
examines the following:

<OL><P><LI>Largest available block of free contiguous disk space.

<P><LI>Total amount of free hard disk space.
<P>
</OL>If there is a temporary swap file already using disk space, Windows cannot
precisely determine the amount of free contiguous hard disk space
available. Windows does not calculate how much, if any, of the temporary
swap file is contiguous. Switching from a permanent to a temporary swap
file does not give this message because the temporary swap file does not
need contiguous disk space.
<P>
After choosing the permanent swap file, restarting Windows, and going back
to the virtual memory settings, there will be a more precise recommended
permanent swap file size. This is because Windows knows the exact amount of
space being taken by the file and its location on the hard drive.
<P>
For further information on how Windows determines the swap file size,
query on the following words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   recommended and maximum and swap and file and size
