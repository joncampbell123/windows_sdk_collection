The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
SUN PC-NFS is not directly supported by Windows 3.1. The Windows Setup
program detects it as NO NETWORK INSTALLED. SUN PC-NFS may work correctly
with Windows 3.1 if you modify the SYSTEM.INI file as described in this
article.
<P>
NOTE: Version 3.5C should be used for the modification. However, please
note that even with the modifications, PC-NFS is still not directly
supported by Windows 3.1.
<P>
<P><h3>SYSTEM.INI</h3>
 
<P>
Using a text editor, add the following line to the [386Enh] section of the
SYSTEM.INI file:
<P>
<PRE>   UniqueDosPSP=True

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Viewing and Connecting to Network Shares</h3>
 
<P>
With version 3.5C of PC-NFS, you cannot view a network printer queue
from within Print Manager. Also, you cannot connect or disconnect
network drives from within File Manager. You can still make the
connection to a PC-NFS host server either from MS-DOS before going
into Windows or from an MS-DOS command prompt in Windows.
<P>
Network connections made from an MS-DOS command prompt before entering
Windows appear as local drives in File Manager. The connections are
accessible from File Manager or any MS-DOS command prompt. You can
disconnect the network drive from an MS-DOS command prompt.
<P>
Network connections made from an MS-DOS command prompt in Windows are
only visible to that MS-DOS session. This network connection is not
visible from File Manager or from MS-DOS after you exit Windows.
<P>
<P><h3>3COM Interrupt Conflict</h3>
 
<P>
If you run Windows in 386 enhanced mode and have a 3COM board
installed and configured for IRQ3, the machine may hang or lock up
when you try to access a remote drive or printer. If a problem occurs,
either use a different interrupt setting on the network card, or run
Windows in standard mode.
<P>
<P><h3>Swap and Temporary Files</h3>
 
<P>
Any 386-enhanced mode swap files or standard mode temporary files
should be created on a local drive. The SYSTEM.INI settings and MS-DOS
environment variables listed below should NOT refer to a remote drive:
<P>
<PRE>   Section of SYSTEM.INI         Setting
   -------------------------------------

   [386Enh]                      PagingFile=(path to a local drive)
   [NonWindowsApp]               SwapDisk=(path to a local drive)

   MS-DOS Environment Variable
   ---------------------------

   SET TEMP=(any directory that exists on a local drive)

</PRE><h3>PIFs for PC-NFS 3.5C Utilities</h3>
 
<P>
When creating a .PIF file for PC-NFS utilities in 386 enhanced mode,
be sure to use the Lock Application Memory In Advance option in the
PIF editor. Failure to do so may result in system crashes or data
loss.
