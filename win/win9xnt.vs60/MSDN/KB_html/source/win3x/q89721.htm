The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.1, 3.11
<LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When performing an upgrade installation of Windows 3.1, Setup rebuilds the
Main, Accessories, and Games program groups with defaults. In addition, PIF
files for MS-DOS-based applications that are found when you run Express
Setup or Custom Setup, and then select Setup Applications, are overwritten
with defaults.
<P>
NOTE: The Startup group will not be modified.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Main, Games, and Accessories groups are returned to their default
configuration when you upgrade to Windows 3.1. If you have customized these
groups by deleting icons from them, those icons will be restored during
setup. If you have added additional icons to the groups, these icons will
not be deleted. Additional groups that you or other applications have set
up will not be affected.
<P>
In addition, any program information files (PIFs) that you created should
be backed up to ensure that they are not overwritten by a default PIF for
the application.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Back up all the .GRP and PIF files before upgrading. These files are set up
by default in the WINDOWS directory. After the upgrade is complete, restore
them to the WINDOWS directory.
<P>
If you are upgrading to Windows for Workgroups and want to preserve
these default groups, be aware that the above workaround removes the
following icons from their respective groups:

<UL><LI>Main Group
   ----------
<P>
   Clipbook Viewer
   Mail
   Schedule+

<LI>Accessories Group
   -----------------
<P>
   Chat
   WinMeter
   NetWatcher

<LI>Games Group
   -----------

   Hearts
