The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.1, 3.11
<LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
IBM has confirmed that when an IBM AS/400 is used as a file server, Windows
will not recognize the AS/400 folders when Windows or Windows for
Workgroups is running in 386 enhanced mode. However, Windows 3.1 or 3.11
will recognize these folders when running in standard mode.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
According to IBM, the problem is due to the AS/400 device drive ECYDDX.SYS,
which allocates logical drives.
<P>
NOTE: This device driver may prevent Windows for Workgroups 3.11 File
Manager from recognizing drive A or B, resulting in the "drive A: or B:
does not exist" error message.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To correct the problem, obtain a Program Temporary Fix (PTF) for the
appropriate version, release, and modification level of ECYDDX.SYS. This
information can be obtained by typing "go licpgm" (without the quotation
marks) and choosing Option 10 on the AS/400.
<P>
To update the system, obtain one of the following files

<UL><LI>For V2R1M0 use (PTF) SF10163
<LI>For V2R1M1 use (PTF) SF10165
<LI>For Extended DOS use (PTF) SF09768
<P>
</UL>where V is the version, R is the revision, and M is the modification
level.
<P>
These corrections may be obtained from IBM by using the ECS Modem
connected to the AS/400. Please contact IBM if you have further questions
regarding this particular problem or how to correct it.
<P>
The AS/400 included here is manufactured by a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this
product's performance or reliability.
