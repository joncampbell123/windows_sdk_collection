The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Windows for Workgroups 3.11, if you try to install the Microsoft
Data Link Control (MS-DLC) protocol for Windows for Workgroups by using
the SETUP.EXE program provided on the installation disk, you receive
the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   The network setup process could not be started.

   Setup Error 908: The version of the NETWORK.INF file that is currently
   on your system is incompatible with Setup and Control Panel. Expand and
   copy the NETWORK.INF file into the Windows SYSTEM directory.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When you run MS-DLC SETUP.EXE, it first copies over the WFWSETUP.DLL
and WFWSETUP.CPL files. This replaces the Windows for Workgroups 3.11
WFWSETUP.DLL file with an older version and causes a file that is no
longer used to be added. Next, the MS-DLC Setup program attempts to run
the Windows for Workgroups 3.11 network setup routine. MS-DLC Setup
uses the correct routine for Windows for Workgroups 3.1, but this
routine doesn't work with version 3.11.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Do not modify the NETWORK.INF file (there is nothing wrong with it).
To correct this problem, first delete the WFWSETUP.DLL file from the
Windows SYSTEM directory, then expand the correct version from the
Windows for Workgroups 3.11 Disk 2 (for both the 3.5-inch and 5.25-inch
disk sets). To expand the file, use the following syntax
<P>
<PRE>   expand &lt;a&gt;:\wfwsetup.dl_ &lt;c&gt;:&lt;\windows\system&gt;\wfwsetup.dll

</PRE>where &lt;a&gt; is your floppy disk drive containing Disk 2, &lt;c&gt; is your drive
containing Windows, and &lt;\windows\system&gt; is the path for your Windows
SYSTEM directory. Also, delete the WFWSETUP.CPL file from your computer.
Windows for Workgroups 3.11 does not use this file. Restart Windows and
add the MS-DLC protocol as an unlisted or updated protocol by choosing the
Network Setup icon, which is located in the Network program group.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
For information on installing an unlisted or updated protocol in Windows
for Workgroups 3.11 see the "User's Guide." For additional information on
setting up and configuring Microsoft DLC, see the Windows for Workgroups
3.11 Resource Kit or the MS-DLC documentation.
