The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
A bitmap (.BMP) file created in Windows Paintbrush does not appear to tile
if the image attributes are not set to the desired size before the image is
created. It is possible, however, to take an image that was incorrectly
created in a full canvas, and make a new image that has the correct image
attributes to be tiled on the Windows desktop.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If you attempt to change the image attributes of an existing drawing,
nothing will happen with Windows version 3.0. With Windows version 3.1
you will receive the following message:
<P>
<PRE>   Resetting image attributes will clear the current image and start a
   new editing session.

   Do you want to start a new session with the new image attributes?

</PRE>Choosing Yes will start a new session with the desired size (image
attributes); however, the new session will not contain the old loaded
image.
<P>
<P><h3>Creating a Bitmap Tile Image from Scratch</h3>
 
<P>
If you want to create a bitmap image to be tiled on the Windows
Desktop:

<OL><P><LI>From the Options menu, choose Image Attributes.

<P><LI>Select the correct width and height for your tile image.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose New. The image attributes (the drawing
   area) will be the size you specified. The image then will be tiled
   on the Windows Desktop as much as possible, depending upon the
   ratio of the image attributes size, verses the total screen size.
<P>
</OL><h3>Creating Bitmap Tile Image From a Previously Created Full-Screen Bitmap</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start Paintbrush.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Open to open the image in Paintbrush.

<P><LI>From the View menu, choose Cursor Position. This will display the
    x, y coordinates of the mouse cursor position from the top-left
    corner. The coordinates in pixels are displayed on the Paintbrush
    menu bar towards the right.

<P><LI>Select the Pick tool (scissors with a dotted box over them). Then
    draw a rectangle selecting ONLY the part of the image you want to
    be your tile image.

<P><LI>From the Edit menu, choose Copy.

<P><LI>You should still have the Pick tool selected. While the Pick tool
    is the active tool, the mouse cursor looks like a large plus sign
    when the cursor is inside the drawing area.

<P><LI>There are two possible cases for this next step:
<P>
    a. The desired tile image is in the top-left corner of the
       Paintbrush drawing region. If this is the case, then put the
       center of the cursor (the point where the lines cross) at the
       bottom right corner of the rectangular box you have drawn around
       your image to be tiled. Write down the numbers being displayed on
       the menu bar in the upper-left corner for the x, y coordinates in
       pixels.
<P>
    b. The desired tile image is somewhere in the Paintbrush canvas
       other then the top-left corner. If this is the case, then put the
       center of the cursor (point where the lines cross) at the
       top-left corner of the rectangular box you have drawn around your
       image and then write down the coordinate numbers displayed on the
       menu bar.
<P>
       Next, place the center of the cursor on the bottom-right corner
       of the rectangle, and then write down the numbers displayed on
       the menu bar. Subtract the first pair of numbers from their
       corresponding second numbers you have written down.

<P><LI>From the Options menu, choose Image Attributes.

<P><LI>Change the Units to "pels".

<P><LI>Change the numbers for the width and height to match those you
    determined in step 7. Choose OK.

<P><LI>You will now have a blank drawing area the size you specified,
    which should match your desired tile bitmap image. From the Edit
    menu, choose Paste.

<P><LI>Save this new image with a filename that is different from the
    filename of the original bitmap image. Make sure the file is saved
    to the Windows directory.

<P><LI>Run Control Panel and choose the Desktop icon. Change the
    Wallpaper selection the filename indicated in step 12 and select
    the Tile option.

<P><LI>Exit Control Panel, and you should now have your image tiled on
    the desktop.
