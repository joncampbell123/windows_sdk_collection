</PRE><h3>Introduction</h3>
 
<P>
You may have problems quitting Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 on
systems using the NDIS version 2 IBM(R) token ring driver
(IBMTOK.DOS). If you run, quit, and then restart Windows for
Workgroups (without restarting the computer), the computer usually
stops responding (hangs). With this driver, you may also notice that
your video display is reset after you quit Windows for Workgroups. For
example, if your video display is set to 50-line mode before you run
Windows for Workgroups, it may be reset to 25-line mode after you
quit.
<P>
The WG0971 disk included with this Application Note contains a new
NDIS 2.0/3 support layer file (NDIS2SUP.386) to correct these
problems.
<P>
<P><h3>To install the new NDIS2SUP.386 file</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Insert the enclosed WG0971 disk in the appropriate floppy disk
   drive.

<P><LI>To copy the file to the Windows SYSTEM directory, type the
   following at the MS-DOS command prompt and then press ENTER
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy &lt;drive&gt;:\ndis2sup.386 &lt;destination&gt;
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;drive&gt; is the floppy disk drive containing the WG0971 disk
   and &lt;destination&gt; is the drive and directory of your Windows SYSTEM
   directory.
<P>
   For example, if the WG0971 disk is in drive A and your Windows
   directory is C:\WINDOWS, type the following at the MS-DOS command
   prompt and then press ENTER:
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy a:\ndis2sup.386 c:\windows\system
</PRE><P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows for
Workgroups version 3.11. We are researching this problem and will post new
<P><h3>information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.</h3>
