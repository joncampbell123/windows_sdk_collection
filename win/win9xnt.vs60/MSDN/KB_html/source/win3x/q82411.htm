The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Lotus Express is an electronic mail package that runs under MS-DOS
versions 3.x or earlier. However, a utility called METRO.EXE version
1.11a allows Lotus Express to run under MS-DOS versions 4.x and 5.0.
For more information, contact Lotus Express customer support.
<P>
For proper use of Lotus Express with Microsoft Windows, do the following:

<UL><LI>Do not load Lotus Express before starting Windows. Instead, start
   Lotus Express from a program information file (PIF) after loading
   Windows. The Lotus Express icon and EXPRESS.PIF file are included
   with the Windows Setup disks.

<LI>In standard mode, you must close Lotus Express to switch to other
   tasks. As a result, Lotus Express can't run in the background.

<LI>In enhanced mode, Lotus Express can run in the background, but you
   may still encounter problems. The KB Required (Memory
   Requirements) field may be reduced from 320K to 155K if needed in
   EXPRESS.PIF.
<P>
</UL>WARNING: Lotus Express version 1.0, even when run from its PIF, may
still be incompatible with Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Lotus Express documentation states that Lotus Express should be
loaded BEFORE running Windows, and should be unloaded AFTER exiting
Windows.
<P>
This is NOT recommended with the Microsoft Windows versions 3.1 and 3.11.
<P>
The following can occur if Lotus Express is running before starting
Windows:

<UL><LI>With Lotus Express running, Windows 3.1 Setup may fail because of
   insufficient memory to read SETUP.INF. Either unload Lotus Express
   (press ALT+SHIFT+END) before running Setup, or load HIMEM.SYS and
   EMM386.EXE at bootup before running Lotus Express and Windows
   Setup.

<LI>With Lotus Express running before loading Windows 3.1 in standard
   mode, some applications may appear to load; however, only the
   icons appear on desktop. You can call Lotus Express screens ONLY
   from the FIRST MS-DOS box, and you must exit screens to switch
   tasks. If you attempt to unload Lotus Express from an MS-DOS box,
   it won't work. If after such an attempt you want to close the
   MS-DOS box, the system will stop responding (hang or restart).

<LI>With Lotus Express running before loading Windows in 386
   enhanced mode, some applications may not be able to run due to
   insufficient memory. It is possible to decrease the KB Required
   field (Memory Requirements) in the PIF for some applications to
   enable them to run. Problems loading large files may be
   encountered. You can access Lotus Express screens ONLY from ANY
   ONE virtual machine session. Windows may experience contention
   between Lotus Express and any application for some resources such
   as COM ports, which will require your intervention.

<LI>In either mode, Lotus Express will not re-install itself from an
   MS-DOS box or virtual-machine session. Also, Lotus Express
   sometimes cannot unload itself from memory when you press
   ALT+SHIFT+END, which requires you to restart your system after
   exiting Windows.
