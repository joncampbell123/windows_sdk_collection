</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Windows for Workgroups Setup does not perform an upgrade
over Microsoft Windows version 3.1 if it does not detect enough free
disk space. If Setup fails for some reason and you run Setup a second
time, it may refuse to upgrade your system.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs if Setup incorrectly detects insufficient free
disk space. Setup assumes it is upgrading Windows 3.1 and does not
account for the Windows for Workgroups files it has already
transferred.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, delete some Windows for Workgroups files
before you start Setup. The following are some files you can safely
delete:
<P>
<PRE>   NETAPI.DLL
   PMSPL.DLL
   WIN386.EXE

</PRE>You can also delete files with the extensions .BMP and .HLP. These
files are copied again when you run Setup.
<P>
NOTE: Avoid deleting files with the extensions .INI and .GRP. Such
files contain information about your custom Windows configuration.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Windows for Workgroups Setup uses WINVER.EXE to determine which
version of Windows it is installing over. Unfortunately, WINVER.EXE is
one of the last files to transfer. Often in a failed installation,
WINVER.EXE does not get copied; therefore, Setup thinks that it is
upgrading Windows 3.1.
