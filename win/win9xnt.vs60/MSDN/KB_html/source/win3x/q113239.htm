The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
Microsoft does not encourage nor support changes to .INF files; therefore,
Microsoft Product Support Services (PSS) does not support the procedure in
this article. Although we have tested the following procedure and it
appears to function as described, we recommend that you make a backup copy
of your .INF file before you proceed.
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Remote Access Services (RAS) client that ships with Microsoft Windows
for Workgroups supports the packet-switching protocol X.25. The X.25
protocol is used to gain access to vendor-provided wide area networks
(WANs) by modem or direct connections from terminals and computers.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
RAS can be set up as a client to dial Packet Assembly/Disassembly (PAD)
services that are supplied by X.25 carriers. Windows for Workgroups RAS
clients support X.25 networking if the PAD.INF file is set up with the
correct X.25 command scripts. The default PAD entries in the PAD.INF file
include InfoNet, SprintNet Alternate, and SprintNet Standard.
<P>
In some cases, you may need to manually enter the specific PAD command
scripts in the PAD.INF file. These command scripts allow you to automate
communication with your vendor's X.25 dial-up PAD, however, you have the
option to log on interactively to the dial-up PAD by using the Windows For
Workgroups RAS Terminal feature. For additional information refer to the
section titled "CONFIGURING WINDOWS RAS TO USE RAS TERMINAL AFTER DIALING"
in the following article:

   TITLE     :Automating Remote RAS Logons Using SWITCH.INF Scripts

</PRE>The following steps may allow you to connect to an X.25 provider through
Windows for Workgroups RAS:

<OL><P><LI>1. In Remote Access, choose Add from the toolbar.

<P><LI>In the Phone Book Entry dialog box, select Advanced.

<P><LI>At the bottom of the Advanced Phone Book Entry dialog box, select X.25.

<P><LI>Fill in the fields in the X.25 dialog boxes.
<P>
<P><PRE>    - PAD Type: Enter the name of the X.25 provider (for example,
      SprintNet, InfoNet, or another provider that was added to PAD.INF
      file manually).
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - X.121 Address: Provide the access phone number for the X.25 network.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - User Data: Enter any additional connection information required
      by the X.25 host computer. In Windows for Workgroups RAS Setup for
      X.25, the User Data field is usually left blank unless additional
      connection information is required.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>     - Facilities: Facility parameters for the X.25 provider. (For example,
       some X.25 providers support the /R parameter to specify reverse
       charging. Consult the X.25 documentation or provider for more
       information.)
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    NOTE: "PAD Type" and "X.121 Address" are mandatory settings. The
    options for "User Data" and "Facilities" may be optional settings if
    you are using RAS X.25 connectivity for Windows for Workgroups.
</PRE><P>
</OL>To access the X.25 network as a client or server with X.25 smart cards, you
must have RAS 1.1a, which ships with Microsoft Windows NT and Microsoft
Windows NT Advanced Server. Direct connections with X.25 smart cards are
not supported with the Windows for Workgroups 3.11 RAS product.
