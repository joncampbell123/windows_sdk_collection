The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you log on to a Microsoft LAN Manager domain when starting Windows
for Workgroups and you are running a logon script that makes network
drive connections, the following error message may appear:
<P>
<PRE>   An error occurred while reconnecting X: to &lt;\\SERVER\SHARE:&gt;
   [SYS0000]
   Do you want to continue restoring connections?

</PRE>This error may appear for one or more persistent network connections.
Although this error occurs, any persistent connections should still be
accessible from File Manager.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Using LAN Manager logon scripts for network drive connections in
conjunction with Windows for Workgroups is not recommended since
Windows for Workgroups maintains its own list of persistent network
connections in the CONNECT.DAT file. If you need to use a logon script
for network drive connections, use the workaround detailed below.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this error message, rename the CONNECT.DAT file in the
Windows directory to CONNECT.OLD and add the /PERSISTENT:NO (/P:N)
parameter to lines in the logon script that make network drive
connections. The following line is an example:
<P>
<PRE>   net use x: \\server\share /p:n

</PRE>Any previous Windows for Workgroups persistent network connections
that aren't created with the logon script need to be manually
reconnected, which rewrites the CONNECT.DAT file. Make sure not to
create any network connections that are already in the logon script.
<P>
Once the Windows for Workgroups persistent connections are re-created,
you should not have any problems using logon scripts for other network
connections as long as there is a /P:N parameter after the NET USE
command so that it does not write to the CONNECT.DAT file.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This error is caused by the LAN Manager logon script using a NET USE
command, which by default writes the network drive connection to the
CONNECT.DAT file used by Windows for Workgroups for persistent network
connections.
<P>
The Windows for Workgroups 386 enhanced mode redirector always looks
for a CONNECT.DAT file for any persistent connections and tries to
establish any connections present in the file. Since a connection was
already created by the NET USE command in the logon script, when the
386 enhanced redirector tries to make the connection, the above error
message appears.
<P>
This error does not occur if you start Windows for Workgroups in
standard mode since the real-mode redirector should have already been
started at MS-DOS and any persistent network connections are
established at that point.
