The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
It is possible to run a shared copy of Windows for Workgroups from a Novell
NetWare server as long as Novell NetWare has been added as a secondary
network.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
For Windows for Workgroups to run from a shared directory on the network, a
real-mode redirector must be loaded prior to starting Windows and a
connection to the shared directory must be made. Setup does NOT modify
AUTOEXEC.BAT to start the real-mode network; this modification must be made
manually.
<P>
However, Setup does ensure that all of the necessary components for running
the real-mode redirector are on the local drive. Setup adds MSIPX and NETX
to the AUTOEXEC.BAT file when Novell NetWare compatibility is added.
<P>
NOTE: You must log on before starting Windows.
<P>
<P><h3>Using a Local Windows Directory</h3>
 
<P>
If your personal Windows directory is on a local hard drive, the real-mode
network driver files are copied to the local Windows directory. These files
include PROTMAN.DOS, PROTOCOL.INI, MSIPX.SYS, MSIPX.COM, and NETX.COM.
<P>
<P><h3>Using a Windows Directory on the Network</h3>
 
<P>
If your personal Windows directory is on the Novell server, the real-mode
network driver files will be copied to the system startup driver root
directory (usually C:\). The files are copied there to guarantee that the
files will be accessible from the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files during
system startup.
<P>
<P><h3>The PATH= Statement</h3>
 
<P>
As with any SETUP /N configuration, your PATH= statement in the
AUTOEXEC.BAT file must contain the personal WINDOWS directory and the
shared WINDOWS directory. The personal WINDOWS directory should come first
on the path. For example:
<P>
<PRE>   path=c:\windows;z:\shared\windows;c:\dos

</PRE>Setup adds these to the path automatically during SETUP /N, but if you
change the path or the drive letter where the directories exist, you will
have to edit the AUTOEXEC.BAT file and change the PATH= statement yourself.
