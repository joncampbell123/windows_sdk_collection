The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When a network connection is made with Chat, ClipBook, File Manager,
or Print Manager in Windows for Workgroups (WFWG), it is placed in the
WIN.INI file in a Most Recently Used (MRU) list.
<P>
The purpose of the Most Recently Used sections of the WIN.INI file is
to maintain a list of previous connections for the network-aware
utilities in Windows for Workgroups. Once an entry is made in the Most
Recently Used list, it can only be removed by either adding enough new
connections or editing the WIN.INI file.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In the WIN.INI file, the previous connections are stored in three
different sections:

<UL><LI>Chat and ClipBook connections are stored in the [MRU_Chat] section.
   The limit on the number of previous connections in this section
   is 12.

<LI>File Manager connections are stored in the [MRU_Files] section.
   The limit on the number of previous connections in this section
   is 12.

<LI>Print Manager connections are stored in the [MRU_Printers] section.
   The limit on the number of previous connections in this section
   is 12.
<P>
</UL>At the top of each of these sections is an Order= line and it keeps
the order of the most recently used connections. Below the Order= line
is the list of all the connections that correspond to the letters in
the Order= line.
<P>
For example, if the Order=dabc line is present, the most recent
connection made was the connection listed under d=, while the
connection that has gone the longest without being used is listed on
the c= line.
<P>
<P><h3>Removing a Connection from the MRU List</h3>
 
<P>
To remove a connection from a Most Recently Used list, use the
following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Edit the WIN.INI file using any text editor.

<P><LI>Locate the appropriate Most Recently Used section.

<P><LI>Delete the line that lists the connection.

<P><LI>Reorder the lines so that there is no break in the order. For
   example, when there are connections listed from "a" to "e" as in
   the following list (when "d=\\george" is deleted), change "e=\\lisa"
   to "d=\\lisa".
<P>
<P><PRE>      [MRU_Chat]
      Order=cadeb
      a=\\john
      b=\\bill
      c=\\susan
      d=\\george
      e=\\lisa
</PRE>
<P><LI>Remove references to any connections that no longer exist from
   the Order= line. In the above example, "e" was renamed to "d,"
   so the Order= should be changed to Order=cadb.

<P><LI>Save the changes to the WIN.INI file and restart Windows for
   Workgroups.
<P>
</OL>Connections are also removed if the limit is exceeded by adding a
new connection. Once the limit is exceeded, the last connection
referenced in the Order= line is removed and the new connection
becomes the first on the Order= line.
