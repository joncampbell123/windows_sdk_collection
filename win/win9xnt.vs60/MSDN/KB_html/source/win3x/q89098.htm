The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Novell workstations can produce the following error message when
attempting to run Windows in 386 enhanced mode
<P>
<PRE>   Network Error on Server XXXXXXXX:Error Sending on network
   Abort, Retry?

</PRE>-or-
<P>
<PRE>   System Error cannot read from device NETWORK

</PRE>where XXXXXXXXX represents the file server name.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
These messages mean the client (workstation) and the server are no longer
communicating. The error conditions is caused by one of the following:

<UL><LI>IRQ conflict with the network card
<LI>Windows 3.0 and 3.0a patch is needed
<LI>Server is no longer operating
<LI>RAM or base I/O address conflict with network card
<P>
</UL>NOTE: You cannot disable this error message (CASTOFF /ALL does not work.)
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve the problem, you must first determine where the
communication problem is located. Follow each set of procedures,
below, until you locate the cause.
<P>
<P><h3>Determining How the Network Card Is Configured</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Search the hard drive for IPX.COM. There should be one copy only.
   When you find the file, change to the directory where IPX.COM
   resides.

<P><LI>Type the following at the MS-DOS command line:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ipx i
</PRE><P>
</OL>This tells you the IRQ, base I/O address, RAM address, and software
versions being used. If you see a message about the card being
self-configurable, then you may need to run a utility program that
came with the card or computer to find this information.
<P>
NOTE: The information returned by "ipx i" may not be the exact
settings of the network card. The card settings and the ipx  settings
can be  different and the network may still connect.  If this
happens,Microsoft Windows may stop responding (hang)  because of the
upper memory conflict. If the card is not found at the ipx address, it
may default to "First Software Configured Adapter." The card is simply
searched out and its settings are used.
<P>
When you are reconfiguring a network card, you must generate a new
IPX.COM with SHGEN or WSGEN (NetWare 386). For more information about
this, refer to your system administrator or to the Novell manuals.
<P>
<P><h3>IRQ Conflict with the Network Card</h3>
 
<P>
The network card should be on a unique IRQ that is not being used by
any other device. If there is a conflict, reconfigure the network card
or the other device to use a different IRQ.
<P>
An IRQ is considered in use if it is being monitored by the peripheral
interrupt controller (PIC). For example, if the COM2 port is using IRQ
3, and no physical device (printer or modem) is connected to IRQ 3, it
would still be in use.
<P>
<P><h3>Windows 3.0 and 3.0a Patch Needed</h3>
 
<P>
If you attempt to use IRQ2 or an IRQ located on the second PIC chip,
then you need to obtain the Novell patch VPICDA.386 and install it.
<P>
If this patch is installed correctly and the error message continues,
select another network card IRQ.
<P>
<P><h3>Server Is No Longer Operating</h3>
 
<P>
If the Novell server goes, then this error message appears and the
workstation locks or hangs. This is a limitation of the Novell
drivers. For more information on this, query on the following in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   novell and standard and disconnects

</PRE></OL><h3>RAM or Base I/O Address Conflict with Network Card</h3>
 
<P>
The network card should have unique base I/O and RAM addresses. If
there is a conflict or if the error message continues, try setting the
base I/O address to 300h or higher. Some network cards (such as ARCNET
cards and some Western Digital Ethernet card), when configured for
D000h do not operate properly. Reconfigure them for D800h.
<P>
<P><h3>Displaying Available Network Card Hardware Configurations</h3>
 
<P>
Change to the MS-DOS directory that contains the IPX.COM file. Type
the following at the command line:
<P>
<PRE>   ipx d

</PRE>This displays the choices available when generating an IPX.COM for the
selected network interface card. Current hardware configuration is
denoted by an asterisk.
