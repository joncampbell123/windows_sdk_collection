The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
Microsoft does not encourage nor support user changes to .INF files;
therefore, Microsoft Product Support Services (PSS) does not support the
procedure in this article. Although we have tested the following procedure
and it appears to function as described; we strongly recommend that you
make a backup copy of your .INF file before you proceed.
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article provides a method to install shared printer drivers without
copying the printer drivers to the user directory. This procedure is
applicable only to printer drivers included in the Windows Driver Library
(WDL) and requires modification of the CONTROL.INF file.
<P>
NOTE: This procedure may not work with all WDL drivers. For example, the
WDL self-extracting file HPPCL5.EXE, which contains updated drivers for the
HP LaserJet III through 4Si MX printers, may not work with this procedure.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
After setting up Windows on a network by using the SETUP /A command to
create the shared Windows directory and the SETUP /N command to create the
user directory, you may want to install shared printer drivers. If you
install a new printer driver by using the Printer icon in Control Panel and
selecting Unlisted Or Updated Printer, the driver is copied to your user
directory. To install the driver without copying the driver to the user
directory, use the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Run SETUP /A to expand the Windows files to the public Windows directory
   on the server.

<P><LI>Make a backup copy of the CONTROL.INF file in the shared Windows
   directory. For example, type "copy control.inf control.old" (without the
   quotation marks) at the MS-DOS command prompt and then press ENTER.

<P><LI>Copy the printer driver and related files to the shared directory. For
   example, the WDL self-extracting file HPPCL.EXE contains updated
   drivers for the HP LaserJet through IIP Plus printers. Note that these
   files are compressed. Once you have expanded the following files (by
   using the EXPAND utility), you can copy them to the shared directory:
<P>
<P><PRE>      FINSTALL.DLL
      FINSTALL.HLP
      HPPCL.DRV
      LICENSE.TXT
      OEMSETUP.INF
      PRINTER.TXT
      UNIDRV.DLL
      UNIDRV.HLP
</PRE>
<P><LI>Using two different copies of Windows Notepad, open the OEMSETUP.INF
   file and the CONTROL.INF file.

<P><LI>Copy all the entries in the [io.device] and [io.dependent] sections of
   the OEMSETUP.INF file, and paste them to their respective sections in
   the CONTROL.INF file. An OEMSETUP.INF file exists for each group of WDL
   drivers; therefore, you need to make the modifications to CONTROL.INF
   immediately after copying each group of WDL drivers to the shared
   directory.
<P>
   NOTE: You may need to remove the Read-Only file attribute before editing
   the CONTROL.INF file.

<P><LI>Run Control Panel and choose the Printers icon.

<P><LI>Choose the Add button.

<P><LI>From the List Of Printers box, select the appropriate driver and
   choose the Install button.
<P>
</OL>Depending on the printer driver, certain files (such as font summary files)
may be copied to the user directory. These files should not be removed. If
they are removed, they are rewritten to the user directory the next time
you print from Windows using the associated printer driver.
