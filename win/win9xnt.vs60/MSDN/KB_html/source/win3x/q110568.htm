<LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL>

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Pentium-based machines with a peripheral component interface (PCI) bus and
a 16550 UART chip stop responding (hang) or exhibit other unexpected
behavior when you use communication applications, such as Microsoft At Work
PC Fax or Microsoft Terminal.
<P>
In some cases, you may be able to run the software successfully once but
then experience problems when you try to run it a second time (before
Windows is restarted).
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The PCI bus uses a new universal asynchronous receiver transmitter (UART)
chip that identifies itself as a 16550 chip but does not handle the 16-bit
buffer the same way that the 16550 UART chip does.
<P>
These problems occur if there is data in the chip when the serial
communications application attempts to open the communications port. A
problem with the chip implementation causes the chip to become trapped in a
mode in which data is always detected in its FIFO buffer.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To correct this problem under Windows for Workgroups 3.11, obtain the
updated SERIAL.386 file included with PSS Application Note WG1001: Updated
SERIAL.386 Driver for Windows for Workgroups.
<P>
