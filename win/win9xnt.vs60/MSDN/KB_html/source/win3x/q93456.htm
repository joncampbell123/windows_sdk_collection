The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The following information was taken from the Microsoft Windows for
Workgroups version 3.1 SYSINI.WRI file. This article contains the
second half of the SYSINI.WRI file.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h2>[standard] Section Settings</h2>
 
<P>
The [standard] section contains settings that are specific to running
Windows for Workgroups in standard mode:
<P>
The [standard] section can contain the following settings:
<P>
FasterModeSwitch=&lt;0-or-1&gt;
<P>
Default: 0
<P>
Purpose: Enabling this setting causes Windows for Workgroups running
in standard mode to use a faster method of switching from protected
mode to real mode on many 80286-based computers. When this setting is
enabled, Windows for Workgroups responds quicker to hardware
interrupts, allowing better throughput for interrupt-intensive
applications, such as communications applications. In addition, you
should enable this setting if you are using a Zenith Z-248 system and
are losing characters while typing, or if you are using an Olivetti M-
250-E and lose mouse functionality.
<P>
Note: This setting has no effect on 80386-based computers. Some early
IBM AT and compatible computers do not have the BIOS support necessary
to use this setting. Enabling this setting on these computers may
cause them to lock up when starting Windows for Workgroups.
<P>
Int28Filter=&lt;number&gt;
<P>
Default: 10
<P>
Purpose: Specifies the interval of INT28h interrupts, generated when
the system is idle, that are made visible (or reflected) to software
that is loaded before Windows for Workgroups. Windows for Workgroups
will reflect every nth interrupt, where n is the value of this
setting. For example, a value of 1 reflects every INT28h interrupt, a
value of 2 reflects every second INT28h interrupt, and so on.
Increasing this value might improve Windows for Workgroups
performance, but may interfere with some memory-resident programs,
such as network software. Set this value to 0 to prevent any INT28h
interrupts from being reflected. Setting this value too low (from 1 to
9) might interfere with communications applications.
<P>
NetHeapSize=&lt;kilobytes&gt;
<P>
Default: 20
<P>
Purpose: Specifies the size (in kilobytes) of the data-transfer buffer
that Windows for Workgroups running in standard mode allocates in
conventional memory for transferring data over a network. If an
application is not running correctly, your network may require a
larger buffer than the default value. Increasing this value will
decrease the amount of memory available to applications. If no network
software is running, this setting will be ignored and no memory will
be allocated.
<P>
<P><h2>[386Enh] Section Settings</h2>
 
<P>
The [386Enh] section contains information specific to running Windows
for Workgroups in 386 enhanced mode, including information used for
virtual-memory page swapping.
<P>
The [386Enh] section can contain the following settings:
<P>
AllVMsExclusive=&lt;boolean&gt;
<P>
Default: False
<P>
Purpose: If enabled, this setting forces all applications to run in
exclusive full-screen mode, overriding all contrary settings in the
applications' program information files (PIFs). Enabling this setting
might prolong the length of the Windows session when you are running
network and memory-resident software that is incompatible with Windows
for Workgroups.
<P>
COMBoostTime=&lt;milliseconds&gt;
<P>
Default: 2
<P>
Purpose: Specifies the amount of time (in milliseconds) to allow a
virtual machine to process a COM interrupt. If, while running a
communications application, you lose keyboard characters on the
screen, you can try increasing this value.
<P>
COMMdrv30=&lt;boolean&gt;
<P>
Default: False
<P>
Purpose: If enabled, the Virtual COM Driver (VCD) uses its own copy of
the interrupt handler for the serial communications driver. This
improves performance of your COM ports. Enable this setting if you are
using a Windows version 3.0 serial communications driver. Disable this
setting if you are using the standard Windows version 3.1 serial
communications driver.
<P>
COM1FIFO=&lt;boolean&gt;
COM2FIFO=&lt;boolean&gt;
COM3FIFO=&lt;boolean&gt;
COM4FIFO=&lt;boolean&gt;
<P>
Default: True
<P>
Purpose: Specifies whether the FIFO buffer of a COM port's 16550
Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter (UART) should be enabled
(True) or disabled (False). If a serial port does not have a 16550
UART, this setting is ignored.
<P>
Note: These values are used by Windows for Workgroups for both
standard and 386 enhanced modes.
<P>
COMIrqSharing=&lt;boolean&gt;
<P>
Default: True for Micro Channel Architecture and EISA machines; False
for all other machines.
<P>
Purpose: Specifies whether COM interrupt lines are sharable between
multiple serial ports or with other devices. Enable this setting if
your machine uses the same interrupt for COM3 or COM4 as it does for
COM1 or COM2.
<P>
DOSPromptExitInstruc=&lt;boolean&gt;
<P>
Default: Yes
<P>
Purpose: If this setting is enabled, when you start MS-DOS Prompt, a
message appears with instructions on how to exit and switch away from
MS-DOS Prompt. Disable this setting if you do not want to see the
message.
<P>
DualDisplay=&lt;boolean&gt;
<P>
Default: See "Purpose" below.
<P>
Purpose: Typically, when running in 386 enhanced mode, the memory
between B000:0000 and B7FF:000F is used by the general system unless a
secondary display is detected. Enable this setting if you are using a
VGA-based color display and want EMM386.EXE to include this address
space as an upper memory block (UMB). In addition to enabling this
setting, you must include the i= option in the device=EMM386.EXE
command line in your CONFIG.SYS file as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   device=EMM386.EXE  i=B000-B7FF

</PRE>If this setting is disabled, the address range is available on EGA
systems, but not on VGA systems, because the VGA display device
supports monochrome modes, which use this address space.
<P>
EMMExclude=&lt;paragraph-range&gt;
<P>
Default: None
<P>
Purpose: Specifies a range of memory that Windows for Workgroups will
not scan to find unused address space. This has the side effect of
turning off the RAM and ROM search code for the range. The range (two
paragraph values separated by a hyphen) must be between A000 and EFFF.
This scanning can interfere with some adapters that use the same
memory area. The starting value is rounded down and the ending value
is rounded up to a multiple of 16K. For example, you could set
EMMExclude=C800-CFFF to prevent Windows for Workgroups from scanning
the addresses C800:0000 through CFFF:000F. You can specify more than
one range by including more than one EMMExclude line.
<P>
EMMInclude=&lt;paragraph-range&gt;
<P>
Default: None
<P>
Purpose: Specifies a range of memory that Windows for Workgroups will
treat as unused address space regardless of what may be there.
EMMInclude takes precedence over EMMExclude if you specify ranges that
overlap. The range (two values separated by a hyphen) must be between
A000 and EFFF. The starting value is rounded down and the ending value
is rounded up to a multiple of 16K. For example, you could set
EMMInclude=C800-CFFF to ensure that Windows for Workgroups can use the
addresses C800:0000 through CFFF:000F. You may specify more than one
range by including more than one EMMInclude line.
<P>
EMMPageFrame=&lt;paragraph&gt;
<P>
Default: None
<P>
Purpose: Specifies the starting paragraph where the 64K page frame
will begin when Windows for Workgroups (running in 386 enhanced mode)
cannot find a suitable page frame. Allows an EMM page frame in an area
containing some unused RAM or ROM. For example, you could set
EMMPageFrame=C400 to start the page frame at C400:0000.
<P>
EMMSize=&lt;kilobytes&gt;
<P>
Default: 65536
<P>
Purpose: Specifies the total amount of memory available for mapping as
expanded memory. The default value allocates the maximum possible
amount of system memory as expanded memory. Specify a value for this
setting if you run an application that allocates all of the available
expanded memory. If this is the case, you cannot create new virtual
machines. If this value is zero, no expanded memory is allocated, but
the EMM driver will load. To disable EMM and prevent the EMM driver
from loading, use the NoEMMDriver setting.
<P>
EnableSharingPopUps=&lt;boolean&gt;
<P>
Default: False
<P>
Purpose: Specifies whether a SHARE.EXE sharing-violation message
should appear when a sharing violation occurs while you are using
VSHARE. If this setting is enabled, the SHARE.EXE messages will
appear. If this setting is disabled, the SHARE.EXE message will not
appear and you will not be notified of a sharing violation. Enable
this setting if you are using an MS-DOS-based application that relies
on the sharing-violation message.
<P>
FileSysChange=&lt;on-or-off&gt;
<P>
Default: Off in 386 enhanced mode; not supported in standard mode.
<P>
Purpose: Indicates whether File Manager automatically updates file
information anytime an MS-DOS-based application creates, renames, or
deletes a file. If this setting is disabled, a virtual machine can run
exclusively, even if it modifies files. Enabling this setting can slow
down system performance significantly. If you are sharing directories
and someone else changes the contents of your directories by using an
MS-DOS-based application, File Manager does not update the directory
or file information, even if this setting is enabled.
<P>
InDOSPolling=&lt;boolean&gt;
<P>
Default: No
<P>
Purpose: If enabled, prevents Windows for Workgroups from running
other applications when memory-resident software has the InDOS flag
set. Enabling this setting is necessary if the memory-resident
software needs to be in a critical section to do operations off an
INT21 hook, but will slow down system performance slightly.
<P>
INT28Critical=&lt;boolean&gt;
<P>
Default: True
<P>
Purpose: Specifies whether a critical section is needed to handle
INT28h interrupts used by memory-resident software. Some networks do
internal task switching on INT28h interrupts. These interrupts might
lock up some network software, indicating the need for an INT28h
critical section. If you are not using such software, you might
improve Windows task switching by disabling this setting.
<P>
LocalReboot=&lt;on-or-off&gt;
<P>
Default: On
<P>
Purpose: Specifies whether you can press CTRL+ALT+DEL to quit
applications that cause an unrecoverable error in 386 enhanced mode.
If this setting is enabled, you can quit the applications without
restarting Windows for Workgroups. If this setting is disabled,
pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL will restart your entire system.
<P>
MaxBPs=&lt;number&gt;
<P>
Default: 200
<P>
Purpose: Specifies the maximum number of break points (a method for
transferring control to Windows running in 386 enhanced mode) that can
be used by the virtual-memory manager. You may need to increase this
value if you are using Microsoft C version 7.0 or a third-party
virtual-device driver that requires more break points than the default
value.
<P>
MaxCOMPort=&lt;number&gt;
<P>
Default: 4
<P>
Purpose: Specifies the maximum number of COM ports supported in 386
enhanced mode. Change this value if you have more than four COM ports
installed in your computer.
<P>
NetAsynchFallback=&lt;boolean&gt;
<P>
Default: False
<P>
Purpose: If this setting is enabled, Windows for Workgroups attempts
to save a failing NetBIOS request. When an application issues an
asynchronous NetBIOS request, Windows for Workgroups attempts to
allocate space in its global network buffer to receive the data. If
there is insufficient space in the global buffer, Windows for
Workgroups typically fails the NetBIOS request. If this setting is
enabled, Windows for Workgroups attempts to save such a request by
allocating a buffer in local memory and preventing any other virtual
machines from running until the data is received or the timeout period
(specified by the NetAsynchTimeout setting) expires.
<P>
NetAsynchTimeout=&lt;seconds&gt;
<P>
Default: 5.0
<P>
Purpose: Specifies the timeout period (in seconds) when Windows for
Workgroups will enter a critical section in order to service an
asynchronous NetBIOS request. It is used only when the
NetAsynchFallback setting is enabled. This value can include a decimal
(such as 0.5).
<P>
NetCard=&lt;filename&gt;
<P>
Default: None (Setup sets this value to match your configuration.)
<P>
Purpose: Specifies the virtual-device drivers for your network adapter
that Windows for Workgroups uses when running in 386 enhanced mode.
<P>
NetDMASize=&lt;kilobytes&gt;
<P>
Default: 32 on Micro Channel Architecture machines (IBM PS/2 or
compatible); 0 on non-Micro Channel Architecture machines (IBM PC/AT
or compatible).
<P>
Purpose: Specifies the DMA buffer size (in kilobytes) for NetBIOS
transport software if a network has been installed. In this case, the
buffer size is the larger of this value or the value of DMABufferSize.
<P>
NetHeapSize=&lt;kilobytes&gt;
<P>
Default: 12
<P>
Purpose: Specifies the size (in kilobytes) of the data-transfer
buffers in conventional memory that Windows for Workgroups allocates
for transferring data over a network when running in 386 enhanced
mode. This setting is only needed if you are using real-mode
protocols. It is not required if you are using the VNB.386 protocol.
All values are rounded up to the nearest 4K.
<P>
Network=&lt;filename-or-devicename&gt;
<P>
Default: vnetbios.386, vnetsup.386, vredir.386, vserver.386,
vbrowse.386, vwc.386
<P>
Purpose: Specifies the virtual-network drivers that are used when
Windows for Workgroups is running in 386 enhanced mode.
<P>
ReflectDosInt2A=&lt;boolean&gt;
<P>
Default: False
<P>
Purpose: Indicates whether Windows for Workgroups should consume or
reflect DOS INT 2A signals. The default means Windows for Workgroups
will consume these signals and therefore run more efficiently. Enable
this setting if you are running memory-resident software that relies
on detecting INT2A messages.
<P>
SecondNet=&lt;filename&gt;
<P>
Default: None (Setup sets this value to match your configuration.)
<P>
Purpose: Specifies the virtual-network drivers for the networks you
have added support for. Windows for Workgroups uses these drivers when
running in 386 enhanced mode.
<P>
SyncTime=&lt;boolean&gt;
<P>
Default: True
<P>
Purpose: If this setting is enabled, Windows for Workgroups
periodically synchronizes its time with the computer's CMOS clock. If
this setting is disabled, Windows for Workgroups usually maintains the
correct time, unless TrapTimerPorts is disabled and you are running
applications that can cause the system time to run faster or slower
than the actual time. This setting is related to the TrapTimerPorts
setting.
<P>
TimerCriticalSection=&lt;milliseconds&gt;
<P>
Default: 0
<P>
Purpose: Instructs Windows for Workgroups to go into a critical
section around all timer interrupt code and specifies a timeout period
(in milliseconds). Specifying a positive value causes only one virtual
machine at a time to receive timer interrupts. Some networks,
protocols, and other global memory-resident software may fail unless
this setting is used. However, using this setting slows down
performance and can make the system seem to stop for short periods of
time.
<P>
Transport=&lt;filename&gt;
<P>
Default: vnb.386 (Microsoft NetBEUI)
<P>
Purpose: Specifies the network-protocol virtual-device-driver file
that Windows for Workgroups uses when running in 386 enhanced mode.
<P>
TrapTimerPorts=&lt;boolean&gt;
<P>
Default: True
<P>
Purpose: Specifies whether Windows for Workgroups should trap read and
write operations to the system timer ports that are performed by
applications. If this setting is disabled, Windows for Workgroups will
not trap these operations, allowing applications that frequently read
or write to the timer to run faster. However, this may interfere with
ability of Windows for Workgroups to keep accurate system time. If
this setting is disabled, Windows for Workgroups can usually detect
when an application has changed the timer interrupt interval and then
make any adjustments to the time. If your system's time appears to be
running fast or slow, enable this setting. If you do not want to
enable this setting, enable the SyncTime setting. This causes Windows
for Workgroups to check the time periodically and then make any
necessary adjustments.
<P>
V86ModeLANAs=&lt;lana number, lana number&gt;
<P>
Default: None
<P>
Purpose: Specifies the LANA numbers for all the real-mode protocols
and NetBIOS's that Windows for Workgroups recognizes. This setting is
for real-mode protocols and NetBIOS's only. This setting should not
include any LANA numbers for protected-mode protocols or NetBIOS's. If
you start the network before starting Windows for Workgroups, the
values for this setting must include the LANA numbers for the real
mode protocols and NetBIOS's that you want to use. If you do not start
the network before starting Windows for Workgroups, make sure that the
values for this setting do not include LANA numbers for protected-mode
protocols or NetBIOS's.
<P>
VirtualHDIrq=&lt;on-or-off&gt;
<P>
Default: On for AT-compatible computers; Off for all other computers.
<P>
Purpose: If enabled, Windows for Workgroups in 386 enhanced mode can
terminate interrupts from the hard disk controller, bypassing the ROM
routine that handles these interrupts. Some hard disk drives might
require this setting to be disabled in order for interrupts to be
processed correctly. If this setting is disabled, the ROM routine
handles the interrupts, which slows down system performance.
