<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the Diamond Stealth 24 or Diamond Stealth Pro video adapter
board and its related version 2.0 driver (STEALTH.DRV dated 10/6/93) in
conjunction with Windows or Windows for Workgroups, you may experience the
following symptoms:

<UL><LI>You receive blank lines when you try to print TrueType fonts.

<LI>When you print to a HP DeskJet 500 (or other series), some characters
   are not printed.

<LI>When you print to a HP LaserJet, II, III, or IV, some lines do not print
   properly or are not aligned correctly.

<LI>When you print to an Epson LQ (any series), you receive blank pages if
   the paper size is changed from the default or 8 1/2.
<P>
</UL><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Diamond has confirmed that drivers earlier than version 3.0 caused these
symptoms with these printers.

<UL><LI>Download the updated Diamond driver (version 3.0) from CompuServe,
   America Online, or the Diamond bulletin board service (BBS).
<P>
   For the Diamond Stealth 24, download file ST24B.EXE.
   For the Diamond Stealth Pro, download file STPRO2.EXE.
<P>
   NOTE: Diamond cautions that the 3.0 drivers may not work with the
   Hewlett-Packard (HP) 550C, HP 520C, and Canon BJ200 printers.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Change the display driver to VGA.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Diamond Computing has confirmed that the drivers earlier than version 3.0
included with these boards cause this behavior. Diamond Computing has also
confirmed the problems with the 3.0 driver and Hewlett-Packard (HP) 550C,
HP 520C, and Canon BJ200 printers.
