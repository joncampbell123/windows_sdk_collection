The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you try to add additional printers to Windows, you receive the
following message:
<P>
<PRE>   The information file is damaged or not in the system directory.
   Copy the control.inf file from disk #1 ...

</PRE><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 

<UL><LI>Delete all *.INF (information) files from the Windows directory. NOTE:
   Do not delete any *.INF files from the Windows SYSTEM subdirectory.
<P>
   This error occurs if the *.INF files were placed in the Windows
   directory erroneously. This could occur due to user error, or third-
   party installation programs.

<LI>Re-creating the WIN.INI file may also help correct this error. For
   more information about rebuilding the WIN.INI file, query on the
   following words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<P><PRE>      create and win.ini and without and third-party
</PRE>
<LI>Open the SYSTEM.INI file in a text editor (such as Windows Notepad) and
   add a semicolon preceding the Device=SYMEVNT.386 line to disable it:
<P>
<PRE>      ;Device=SYMEVNT.386   ;Added By NU8

   Restart Windows to make this change take effect. Disabling this
   statement does not allow Norton Utilities to run properly while in
   Windows.

   NOTE: SYMEVNT.386 is a device driver provided with Norton Utilities and
   Norton AntiVirus. Symantec has released a new version of this file that
   may correct this error. Download file NU8DRV.EXE from the Symantec
   bulletin board service (BBS).
