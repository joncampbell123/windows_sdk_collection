The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Network printing in Windows for Workgroups is nearly identical to
printing under Microsoft Windows version 3.1. The following
information is based on a default configuration:

<UL><LI>Print Manager is enabled.
<LI>Send Documents Directly To Network check box is selected.
<LI>Background Printing check box is selected. (3.1 only)
<LI>Printing to a Windows for Workgroups server with a shared
   printer resource is enabled(3.1 only).
<P>
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Printing from an MS-DOS-Based Application</h3>
 
<P>
When an MS-DOS-based application writes data to a printer port
connected to a network printer, the network redirector intercepts the
data and sends it across the network to the appropriate server. For
most server types, including Windows for Workgroups and Microsoft LAN
Manager, the server writes the data into a spool file on disk as the
data is received.
<P>
Because MS-DOS-based applications do not generally close the port they
print to, the redirector on the client machine decides when the job is
finished based on the amount of time the application has allowed to
elapse without printing. In Windows for Workgroups 3.1, if the application
does not print any data for the number of seconds specified by the
PRINTBUFTIME= entry in the [Network] section of SYSTEM.INI (45 seconds
by default), then the redirector assumes the print job is done. (Note that
in Windows for Workgroups 3.11, the PRINTBUFTIME= entry is in both the
[network] section and the [ifsmgr] section of SYSTEM.INI file on the client
machine). Care is taken so that the time in which the printing application
is in a suspended state within Windows for Workgroups is not counted
against the timeout value.
<P>
When the print job is done, the network redirector tells the server to
begin closing it. At this point, the server can close the spool file
and begin sending its contents directly to the printer hardware.
<P>
<P><h3>Printing from a Windows-Based Application</h3>
 
<P>
When a Windows for Workgroups client prints from a Windows-based
application, Windows (GDI.EXE) passes the application data to the
appropriate printer driver, which converts it into a data stream that
is fully formatted and ready to send to the printer hardware. If
Windows determines that the target printer is a network printer, then
it passes this data to the network driver. The network driver calls the
redirector to send the data to the server, and close the print job
when completed.
<P>
Note that in both of these cases, the data sent across the network has been
fully formatted for the target printer, and the client computer must have a
printer driver correctly configured for the printing device attached to the
server computer. Once the print job has arrived at the server, it is sent
to the physical printer without modification.
<P>
<P><h3>Separator Pages Handled Differently</h3>
 
<P>
There is an exception to the above information. If a print server is
configured to print a separator page and a job is received from the
network, the server's printer driver is used for the formatting of the
separator page's data. All other formatting is done in advance at the
client machine.
