<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Clipboard is the main data-exchange feature of Microsoft Windows. It is
a common area for storing data handles through which applications can
exchange formatted data. The Clipboard can hold a number of different data
formats and corresponding data handles, all representing the same data, but
in many different formats.
<P>
For example, a pie chart might be held in the Clipboard as both a
metafile picture and a bitmap. An application receiving the pie chart
from the Clipboard would have to choose which representation matched
its requirements. In general, the format that provides the most
information is the most desirable, as long as the application
understands that format.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Windows provides several predefined data formats for use in data
interchange. The following list describes the common formats:
<P>
<PRE>   Format          Description
   ------          -----------

   BITMAP          Specifies a device-dependent bitmap

   DIB             Specifies a device-independent bitmap

   DIF             Specifies that the data is in the Software Arts'
                   data-interchange format (DIF)

   METAFILEPICT    Specifies a metafile-picture structure

   OEMTEXT         Specifies null-terminated text in the OEM
                   character set

   RIFF            Specifies that the data is in any resource
                   interchange file (RIFF) format.

   SYLK            Specifies that the data is in the Microsoft
                   symbolic link (SYLK) format.

   TEXT            Specifies null-terminated text

                   Windows supports two formats for text: TEXT and
                   OEMTEXT. TEXT is the default Windows Clipboard text
                   format. OEMTEXT is used by Windows for text within
                   non-Windows-based applications.

   TIFF            Specifies that the data is in the tag image file
                   format (TIFF).

   WAVE            Specifies that the data is a RIFF waveform file with
                   form type WAVE.

</PRE>NOTE: Clipboard data objects can be any size. The size of memory
allocated for Clipboard usage is determined by the application copying
to the Clipboard and the application receiving data from the
Clipboard. You may receive an application error message if your
application does not allocate sufficient memory.
