The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The VESA Local Bus Diamond Stealth video card may conflict with other
hardware devices because of the hardware I/O address or IRQ.
<P>
NOTE: This information may also apply to other video cards using
the S3 video chip set, such as the Orchid Fahrenheit card, or other
graphics coprocessor cards, such as the ATI Ultra series.
<P>
<P><h3>Hardware I/O Address</h3>
 
<P>
The Diamond Stealth S3-based video card has a hardware I/O address of
02E8, which cannot be changed. This may cause a conflict with other
hardware devices using this same address. By default, many serial
cards and internal modems use this address for COM4. Some ARCnet cards
also use this address.

<UL><LI>If there is a conflict, it may result in garbled TrueType font
   output when printing.

<LI>If the conflict is with a network card, then you may not be able to
   run in 386 enhanced mode.
<P>
</UL>To correct these problems, change the I/O address of the device
conflicting with the Stealth video card.
<P>
<P><h3>Hardware IRQ</h3>
 
<P>
By default, the Diamond Stealth comes configured to use IRQ2. This is
the cascading IRQ to the second Intel 8259 Programmable Interrupt Chip
(PIC).

<UL><LI>If another device is also using this IRQ, you may receive garbled
   TrueType fonts when printing.

<LI>If there is a conflict, you may be prevented from running in 386
   enhanced mode in Windows 3.0 and 3.1.

<LI>If there is no conflict, you still may not be able to run
   in 386 enhanced mode from Windows 3.0.
<P>
</UL>To correct this problem, you can disable the Stealth's use of IRQ2 by
removing a jumper from the video card. Please refer to your Diamond
Stealth user's guide for the procedure.
