The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
You can manipulate network printers from either Control Panel or Print
Manager. However, the capabilities provided from these applications
differ greatly. You can perform only some network printer operations
from Control Panel, whereas you can perform all possible operations
from Print Manager.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In Control Panel, the network driver provides only the minimal support
needed for making a new network connection when setting up a printer
for the first time. This is for backward compatibility with Microsoft
Windows version 3.1 and for use when running Windows for Workgroups
Setup. (Note you might not make network connections during Windows for
Workgroups Setup because the network driver is not loaded during
installation.)
<P>
Print Manager provides full functionality for printer configuration,
including connecting to and disconnecting from network printers and
managing documents in network print queues.
<P>
Some rules apply to the managing of network print queues:

<UL><LI>On a locally connected printer, regardless of the shared status, any
   print job can be deleted. Print jobs sent across the network can
   only be paused.

<LI>On a locally connected printer, the topmost (currently printing) job
   cannot be moved. All locally submitted print jobs must remain above
   all network jobs in the queue. Therefore, the topmost network job
   cannot be moved up, and the bottommost local job cannot be moved
   down. At least three local jobs or at least two remote jobs must be
   in a queue before you can reposition any print job. (Note: Queue
   management menu items and buttons are not always dimmed when the
   options fail because of these rules.)

<LI>On a network (shared) printer, you can only pause and delete your
   own print jobs, and then only before they start printing. You can only
   move your print job down in the queue, and only before it starts
   printing.
