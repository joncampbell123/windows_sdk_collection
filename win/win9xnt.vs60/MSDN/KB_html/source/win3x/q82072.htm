The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Some third-party, or independent software vendors (ISV), applications
do not function correctly in Microsoft Windows version 3.1 if they were
installed with an existing copy of Windows 3.0 on the hard drive and then
Windows 3.10 was installed into a separate directory.
<P>
Many applications modify the Windows WIN.INI file and other data files
and copy their own .INIs, .DLLs, EXEs and other files into the current
WINDOWS or SYSTEM directories when they install. The new installation
of Windows isn't aware of any of these modifications and may not be able to
run the existing applications.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Follow these steps to solve the problem:

<OL><P><LI>Back up your current Windows 3.0 directory and subdirectories
   (SYSTEM, MSAPPS and others).

<P><LI>Install Windows 3.1 into the same directory as Windows 3.0 in order
   to update the existing version of Windows to version 3.1.
<P>
   -or-

<P><LI>Reinstall third-party applications for the Windows 3.1 directory.

<P><LI>During the installation of these applications make sure that they
   use the same directories as were used in their original
   installation.
<P>
   For example, if Wingz was original installed in a directory called
   C:\WINGZ, then during the reinstallation choose that directory.
