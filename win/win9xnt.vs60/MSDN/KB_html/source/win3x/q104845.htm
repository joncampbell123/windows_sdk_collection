The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11
</UL> 

<PRE>1. Q. Where can I get the files I need to set up Novell as a secondary
      network with Windows for Workgroups 3.11?

   A. To obtain the files required to support Novell as a secondary
      network, contact your local Novell authorized reseller or call
      Novell Technical Support at (800) 638-9273. You can also download
      the support files from the Novell CompuServe forum. At the
      CompuServe prompt, type "go novfiles" (without the quotation
      marks). Download the file WINUP7.ZIP. If you are using Novell's
      ODI protocol implementation, also download DOSUP7.ZIP. For more
      information, read the NETWORKS.WRI file located in your Windows
      subdirectory.

2. Q. How do I install support for Novell NetWare if I'm using ODI?

   A. Obtain the necessary Windows support files from Novell and from
      your network adapter manufacturer. Have the Windows support files
      available on a disk or in a subdirectory of the hard disk. Configure
      the workstation for proper NetWare functionality at MS-DOS and
      then use the following steps in Windows for Workgroups:

      1. Run Network Setup and choose Networks.

      2. Select the option button labeled "Other" and then select the
         proper Novell workstation shell.

      3. Choose Drivers, then choose Add Adapter and select your network
         card from the list of adapters.

      4. Ensure the User, Workgroup, and Computer names are correct.

      5. When prompted for the location of the Novell support files and
         the NET.CFG file, specify the appropriate path. When prompted,
         choose Restart Computer.

      For more information, read the NETWORKS.WRI file located in your
      Windows subdirectory.

3. Q. How do I install support for Novell NetWare if I'm using
      IPX.COM?

   A. Configure the workstation for proper NetWare functionality at
      MS-DOS and then use the following steps in Windows for Workgroups:

      1. Run Network Setup, choose Networks, and select the Install
         Microsoft Windows Network option button.

      2. Select the option button labeled "Other," select Novell NetWare
         Workstation Shell 3.X, then choose OK.

      3. Choose Sharing, select the appropriate options, and choose OK.

         Make sure that the option "IPX Support Driver (Monolithic) with
         NetBIOS transport" appears in the Drivers dialog box. This driver
         replaces your specific network adapter driver. Do not add a driver
         for your specific network adapter.

      4. Ensure User, Workstation, and Computer names are correct.

      5. When prompted for the location of the Novell support files,
         specify the appropriate path. When prompted, choose Restart
         Computer.

   For more information, read the NETWORKS.WRI file located in your
   Windows subdirectory.

4. Q. How do I install support for Novell NetWare if I'm using MSIPX?

   A. If your computer is configured to use MSIPX in Windows for
      Workgroups 3.10 and you upgrade to 3.11, the setup program detects
      that you are using MSIPX and preserves this configuration. However,
      once setup is finished, MSIPX is not an installable option. If you
      want to preserve this configuration and prevent overwriting the MSIPX
      configuration, take care not to change the network card settings in
      Network Setup.

5. Q. Does Windows for Workgroups 3.11 support access to Novell
      NetWare servers using ArcNet?

   A. Windows for Workgroups 3.11 supports simultaneous access to
      Novell NetWare servers and 3.11 peer services using ArcNet network
      hardware. This functionality is supported through the use of either
      Novell's monolithic IPX or IPXODI.

6. Q. How do I install support for Novell NetWare if I'm using ArcNet?

   A. To install support for Novell NetWare with ArcNet, you must have
      the Novell NetWare support files for Windows and a fully functioning
      NetWare installation at MS-DOS. Once you do, use the following steps
      in Windows for Workgroups:

      1. Run Network Setup, choose Networks, and select the Install
         Microsoft Windows Network option button.

      2. Select the option button labeled "Other," select Novell
         NetWare Workstation Shell 3.X, then choose OK.

      3. If you are using IPX.COM, choose Drivers, and select the option
         "IPX Support Driver (Monolithic) with NETBIOS transport." This
         driver replaces your specific network adapter driver. If you are
         using ODI, you should install the "IPXODI Support Driver (ArcNet)"
         option instead of your specific network adapter.

      4. When prompted for the location of the Novell files, specify the
         appropriate path.

      For more information, read the NETWORKS.WRI file located in your
      Windows subdirectory.

7. Q. What is the NET.CFG file and why is it important?

   A. NET.CFG is a text file that the Novell ODI implementation uses
      to configure various settings for the workstation network hardware
      and software. The most important things to know about the NET.CFG
      file are that you should have only one and it should be located
      in the same directory as LSL.COM. This file should contain a LINK
      DRIVER section that specifies your network adapter's MLID name,
      hardware configuration, and your Novell Network's frame type.
      For more information on creating a NET.CFG file, consult your
      NetWare documentation.
