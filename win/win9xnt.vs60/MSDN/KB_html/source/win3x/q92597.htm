<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
You have persistent connections enabled, but you can't use File Manager to
disconnect a network drive connection that isn't currently active.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
If a persistent connection cannot be made to a server, it does not display
in File Manager. Because it does not show up in File Manager, you can't use
File Manager to disable the persistent connection.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To disable an inactive persistent connection, you must use the NET USE
command from the MS-DOS command prompt.
<P>
In the following example, drive M is an inactive persistent connection:
<P>
<PRE>   NET USE M: /D /PER:NO

</PRE>This disables the connection, but causes the following error message
to be displayed:
<P>
<PRE>   Error 3: The specified path was not found.

</PRE>To verify that the persistent connection has indeed been disabled, use
the command:
<P>
<PRE>   NET USE /PER:LIST

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Windows for Workgroups offers a feature known as persistent
connections. This feature allows Windows for Workgroups to automatically
reconnect a workstation to various network drives as configured by the
user. Persistent connections are normally handled through the File Manager,
but File Manager cannot disable a persistent connection if the connection
is not currently active.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows for Workgroups
version 3.1. This problem does not occur in later versions of the product.
