The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article discusses using least recently used (LRU) paging settings in
the [386enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI as a possible solution to erratic
mouse behavior when a swap file is active.
<P>
You should use these steps only after you have determined that a mouse
problem is present only when Windows 3.1 is configured to use virtual
memory.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If you experience missed mouse clicks or jerky mouse movements in Windows
while a swap file is active, you may need to adjust the frequency of the
LRU rate in Windows.
<P>
Missed mouse clicks are mouse button actions that seem to be ignored by
Windows. A "stuck" mouse button or click refers to a situation in which
Windows seems to lock the mouse button down. This locking causes a
"runaway" effect when scrolling. Scrolling will seem automatic for up to a
few seconds.
<P>
The LRU settings are outlined on pages 205-206 of the Windows Resource Kit
for Windows 3.1 and, in general, these settings should not be changed. To
determine if your mouse problem is related to the swap file LRU settings,
place the following line in the [386enh] section of your SYSTEM.INI:
<P>
<PRE>    paging=off

</PRE>If this setting does not improve Windows mouse movement, then general mouse
troubleshooting should be performed. The LRU settings should not be
changed.
<P>
Microsoft has an article available that outlines general mouse
troubleshooting. The article "Troubleshooting Microsoft and Compatible Mice
in Windows" (<B><A href="../win3x/q88543.htm">Q88543</A></B>) can be obtained by contacting Microsoft Product
Support Services.
<P>
If testing with "paging=off" resolves the erratic mouse symptoms, remove
the "paging=off" statement from the SYSTEM.INI file and add the following
lines to the [386enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI:
<P>
<PRE>    LRULowRateMult=1

</PRE>This sets the low LRU rate = to the high LRU rate.
<P>
<PRE>    LRUSweepFreq=x

</PRE>This sets the high LRU rate, the default is 250 (1/4 of a second):
<P>
<PRE>   x=60000 = 1 Minute
   x=600000 = 10 Minutes
   x=6000000 = 1,000 Minutes (about 16 hours)
   x=60000000 = 10,000 Minutes (about 6 days)
   x=600000000 = 100,000 Minutes (about 60 days)

</PRE>Try 60000 first; if that behaves, try 600000000.
<P>
NOTE: You may need to experiment some to determine the proper LRU
settings.
<P>
These settings adjust how Windows uses virtual memory. Different
settings for LRUSweepFreq may be needed depending on if a temporary or
permanent swap file is used.
<P>
For more information about erratic mouse behavior, see the "Mouse Pointer
Movement Is Erratic" section in the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base.
