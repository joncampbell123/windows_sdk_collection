The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Your system seems slower after you enable 32-bit file access.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Enabling 32-bit file access can result in slower system performance in
the following situations:

<UL><LI>VFAT is unable to mount.
<P>
   This can happen as a result of one or more of the following
   problems (note that the numbers below correspond to the numbered
   steps in the "VFAT is Unable to Mount" subsection of this article):
<P>
   1. The real-mode network redirector has been loaded into memory.
<P>
   2. A memory-resident program or device driver has a file open while
<P><PRE>      Windows loads.
</PRE><P>
   3. The drive is involved in a SUBST, ASSIGN, or JOIN action.
<P><PRE>      Because of the way they alter apparent disk characteristics, the
      SUBST.EXE, ASSIGN.COM, and JOIN.EXE programs are not compatible with
      installable file systems (IFS), such as 32-bit file access. These
      utilities can't be used if 32-bit file access is enabled.
</PRE><P>
   4. The cache size selected is too large or invalid.
<P>
   5. Required components are missing, corrupted, or not in the specified
<P><PRE>      directory.
</PRE>
<LI>Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 is in a low-memory situation
   after enabling VFAT.
<P>
   Running VFAT/VCACHE with SMARTDrive may place Windows for
   Workgroups into a low-memory situation because memory used by
   SMARTDrive is not available to VCACHE.386 and vice-versa.
   Since VCACHE.386 provides the caching on VFAT-enabled drives
   and network drives, while SMARTDrive caches CD-ROM drives and
   floppy disk drives, it is possible that systems with too large a
   percentage of memory allocated to caching have some performance
   reduction.
<P>
</UL><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Low-Memory Situation</h3>
 
<P>
If you are in a low-memory situation (that is, you are running both
SMARTDrive and VFAT), make sure that the amount of memory allocated to
SMARTDrive's WinCacheSize and the cache size allocated to VCACHE.386
do not exceed roughly 30 percent of total system RAM.
<P>
For example, on a machine with 4 megabytes (MB) RAM, if you have allocated
1024 kilobytes (K) to VCACHE, set the SMARTDrive WinCacheSize to 128K. To
do this, use a command similar to the following
<P>
<PRE>   c:\windows\smartdrv.exe &lt;1024&gt; &lt;128&gt;

</PRE>where &lt;1024&gt; is the InitCacheSize (the cache size at MS-DOS) and &lt;128&gt;
is the size of the cache in Windows.
<P>
<P><h3>VFAT Is Unable to Mount</h3>
 
<P>
If VFAT is unable to mount, try the following:

<OL><P><LI>You can unload the real-mode network redirector by typing "net
   stop" (without the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS command prompt
   before starting Windows for Workgroups.

<P><LI>To ensure that no device driver or terminate-and-stay-resident
   (TSR) program has any files open upon entering Windows for Workgroups,
   clean start the machine.
<P>
   For more information on clean start configurations for Windows for
   Workgroups version 3.11, query on the following words in the Microsoft
   Knowledge Base:
<P>
<P><PRE>      wfw and clean and start
</PRE>
<P><LI>Do not use the SUBST, ASSIGN, or JOIN utilities with 32-bit file
   access enabled. If you must use one of these utilities, disable 32-bit
   access first.

<P><LI>Verify that the cache size selected is valid. For more information,
   see the "Low-Memory Situation" section above.

<P><LI>The components used by VFAT vary depending on the system's hard disk
   drive (HD) controller type and whether or not disk compression (such as
   DoubleSpace, DriveSpace, or Stac Electronics Stacker) is used. If you
   suspect the components are missing, corrupted, or not in the specified
   directory, verify the components files sizes, or re-expand them from
   your original Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 disks.
<P>
<PRE>   File              Size
   ----              ----
   IOS.386           28,352
   RMM.D32           11,894
   RMM.D32           11,473  (version of RMM.D32 included with Microsoft
                             PSS Application Note WG0973)
   VCACHE.386         9,862
   VFAT.386          32,925
   VXDLDR.386         5,678

   NOTE: VFAT cannot load on a volume compressed with MS-DOS 6.0
   DoubleSpace. This problem was resolved in MS-DOS 6.2 and later.

   IMPORTANT: The SYSTEM.INI file entries shown in the examples below are
   made by Control Panel and do not require manual editing. These
   examples are provided to show the component files involved and to aid
   in troubleshooting. You should avoid manually editing your SYSTEM.INI
   file.

   Example 1: Uncompressed WD 1003 Compatible Drive
   ------------------------------------------------

   Western Digital 1003 or ST506 compatible drives without compression
   require the following entries in the [386Enh] section of the
   SYSTEM.INI file:

      [386Enh]
      device=*BLOCKDEV
      device=*PAGEFILE
      device=*int13
      device=*wdctrl
      device=vcache.386
      device=vfat.386

   All entries marked with an asterisk (*) are contained in the
   WIN386.EXE file. All files should be located in your Windows SYSTEM
   subdirectory unless otherwise noted.

   Example 2: Compressed or Not WD 1003-Compatible Drive
   -----------------------------------------------------

   If the drive is compressed, or if another hard disk in the machine is
   not WD 1003 compatible, then the line "device=*BLOCKDEV" should be
   replaced with the following:

      device=IOS.386
      device=VXDLDR.386.

   In addition, the real mode mapper (RMM.D32) must exist in the
   Windows SYSTEM subdirectory.

   Example 3: Not WD 1003-Compatible Drive
   ---------------------------------------

   If 32-bit disk access cannot be used by a particular hard disk
   controller (because it is not WD 1003 compatible), the VFAT entries
   for the SYSTEM.INI file's [386Enh] section should include the
   following:

      [386Enh]
      device=*PAGEFILE
      device=vcache.386
      device=vfat.386
      device=IOS.386
      device=VXDLDR.386

   Again, RMM.D32 must exist in the Windows SYSTEM directory.

</PRE></OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
VFAT is a 32-bit virtual MS-DOS file allocation table (FAT) file system and
can only mount on hard disk volumes. If 32-bit disk access drivers are not
available for a particular hard disk controller, additional handling of INT
13h calls is required. The IOS.386, VXDLDR.386, and RMM.D32 files provide
this functionality and allow VFAT/VCACHE to work on these drives. (Drives
affected include most SCSI and ESDI drives, a few IDE drives, and
compressed volumes residing on any type of hard disk.)
<P>
32-bit disk access drivers may also be provided by an original equipment
manufacturer (OEM) to work with a specific hard disk controller, replacing
Microsoft's *WDCTRL. As a troubleshooting step, these drivers should be
temporarily disabled and IOS.386, VXDLDR.386, and RMM.D32 should be used
instead.
