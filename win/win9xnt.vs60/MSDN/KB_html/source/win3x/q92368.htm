The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The initial release of Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.0 came
with run-time versions of Asymetrix DayBook and ToolBook. Microsoft was
responsible for supporting these run-time versions. Since the release of
Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1, Asymetrix is responsible
for supporting all versions of DayBook and ToolBook.
<P>
This article includes information on some specific problems with
DayBook and ToolBook and possible solutions or workarounds. The
following topics are discussed:

<UL><LI>Can't drag icons when mouse buttons are swapped
<LI>Error when compiling script
<LI>Valid dates problem
<LI>Mouse required
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Can't Drag Icons When Mouse Buttons Are Swapped</h3>
 
<P>
DayBook version 1.0 with the run-time version of ToolBook does not
allow you to drag icons when the mouse buttons are reversed or swapped
in Control Panel. To work around this behavior, click both the mouse
buttons in quick succession; for example, if the right button is the
"active" button, quickly click the right button, then click and hold
down the left button.
<P>
<P><h3>Error When Compiling Script</h3>
 
<P>
"Error when compiling script: Syntax Error" may occur when DayBook is
running and either Setup Applications is started from the Windows
Setup Options menu or Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows is being set
up. Quit DayBook and run Setup again.
<P>
<P><h3>Valid Dates Problem</h3>
 
<P>
You may receive the following message when the internal clock reaches
1992:
<P>
<PRE>   Valid dates for this version of DayBook are 1-1-91 through
   12-31-91. Please check your system date.

</PRE>According to Asymetrix, this problem occurs only in ToolBook's DayBook
version 1.5, in both the full and run-time versions. There are two
solutions to this problem:

<OL><P><LI>Download DB15FIX.ZIP from the Asymetrix bulletin board service
   (BBS) at (425) 451-1173.

<P><LI>If the full version of ToolBook 1.5 is being used, the DAYBOOK.SBK
   script file can be edited. The following two changes need to be
   made:
<P>
   a. Change "12-31-91" to "12-31-93".
   b. Change "12,31,91" to "12,31,93".
<P>
</OL><h3>Mouse Required</h3>
 
<P>
A mouse is not listed as a system requirement on the envelope in which
run-time ToolBook version 1.0 is packaged.
<P>
A mouse is necessary to be able to access all the features in both
TourBook (An Introduction to ToolBook) and DayBook. Without a mouse,
TourBook does not allow you to select or execute any of the tutorials.
In DayBook, the keyboard allows you to access the file menu options
only.
<P>
You will be able to successfully exit both programs using keyboard
commands. In TourBook, press ALT+SPACE and choose Close. In DayBook,
press ALT+F and choose exit.
<P>
ToolBook and DayBook are manufactured by Asymetrix, a vendor
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise,
regarding these products' performance or reliability.
