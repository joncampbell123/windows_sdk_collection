</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Page 1-33: WFWG Resource Kit States Incorrect Protocol Support</h3>
 
<P>
The "Microsoft Windows for Workgroups Resource Kit" for version 3.1
incorrectly states the number of protocol stacks that Windows for
Workgroups supports.
<P>
The resource kit states on page 1-33:
<P>
<PRE>   Windows for Workgroups supports up to four protocol stacks.

</PRE>This statement is misleading. Windows for Workgroups version 3.1
supports up to four protocol stacks per network interface card.
Although there is a maximum of four network interface cards per
system, you cannot have more than eight protocol stacks per system,
regardless of the number of network interface cards installed.
<P>
<P><h3>Page 1-36: Incorrect Definition of Server Message Block (SMB)</h3>
 
<P>
Page 1-36 of the Resource Kit incorrectly defines the functionality of a
Server Message Block (SMB) as it pertains to networking architecture. It
states:
<P>
<PRE>   The redirector packages SMB requests meant for remote
   computers in a structure known as a Network Control Block
   (NCB). NCBs can be sent over the network to a remote device.

</PRE>NCBs are never sent over the wire. Rather, SMBs are transmitted over the
physical media instead.
<P>
<P><h3>Page 22 (Index): Incorrect Page for WINFILE.INI Section</h3>
 
<P>
The "Microsoft Windows for Workgroups Resource Kit" version 3.1
contains a documentation error on page 22 of the index. The page
listing for the WINFILE.INI section incorrectly states the following:
<P>
WINFILE.INI
<PRE>   sections 6-73--74

</PRE>The statement should read as follows:
<P>
WINFILE.INI
<PRE>   sections 6-80--81

</PRE><h3>Page 3-12: Windows Setup: Transition from MS-DOS to Graphical Portion</h3>
 
<P>
The "Microsoft Windows Resource Kit" for version 3.1 (page 68) and
"Microsoft Windows for Workgroups Resource Kit" for version 3.1 (page 3-12)
incorrectly describe the transition from the MS-DOS portion of Setup to the
graphical portion of Setup.
<P>
The resource kit states that the final step for the MS-DOS portion of
Setup is to use the MS-DOS EXEC command to call WIN.COM, which first
displays the logo screen and then starts Windows in standard mode.
This statement is incorrect.
<P>
After building the WIN.COM file and setting the shell statement in the
SYSTEM.INI file equal to SETUP.EXE (SHELL=SETUP.EXE), the MS-DOS EXEC
command is called to start DOSX.EXE, the standard mode MS-DOS
extender. This causes Windows to start in standard mode. No logo is
displayed during the Windows Setup process.
<P>
<P><h3>Page 3-13: Location of Serial Number</h3>
 
<P>
The "Microsoft Windows or Workgroups Resource Kit," version 3.1 states
the following on page 3-13:
<P>
<PRE>   Next setup prompts you for a user name and a company name, which
   is the identifying name that will appear with the registration
   serial number in the About Program Manager dialog box.

</PRE>The serial number is not listed in the About Program manager dialog
box. The serial number is listed in the back of the "Getting Started"
manual. Only the user name and the company name are listed in the About
Program dialog box.
<P>
<P><h3>Page E-5: WFWG Err Msg: DOS -- TCP/IP Resident Driver Initialization...</h3>
 
<P>
The "Microsoft Windows for Workgroups Resource Kit" for version 3.1
contains an error in Appendix E, page 5, under "Configuring the
Microsoft TCP/IP Protocol."
<P>
The setting that shows drivername=tcpip$, under the [ms$tcp] section,
is in lowercase. The driver name should be in all uppercase (capital)
letters, such as Drivername=TCPIP$.
<P>
The PROTOCOL.INI file for Windows for Workgroups can contain
case-sensitive text. If this driver name is in lowercase in the
PROTOCOL.INI file, the following error message is displayed during
startup:
<P>
<PRE>   DOS -- TCP/IP Resident Driver Initialization failed.

</PRE>To correct this problem, change the name of the driver to all capital
letters.
<P>
<P><h3>Page E-10: MaintainServerList=No in [network] Section of SYSTEM.INI File</h3>
 
<P>
The "Microsoft Windows for Workgroups Resource Kit" for version 3.1
incorrectly states on page E-10 that the MaintainServerList=No line should
be added to the [386enh] section. It should be added to the [network]
section.
<P>
<P><h3>Page E-10: No HP StarLAN Adapter in Windows for Workgroups</h3>
 
<P>
On page 19 of Appendix E of the "Windows for Workgroups Resource Kit"
for version 3.1, step 6 reads as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   When prompted for your network adapter, choose HP StarLAN network
   adapter.

</PRE>There is no Hewlett-Packard (HP) StarLAN network adapter available in
version 3.1 of Windows for Workgroups. For this step, substitute any
network adapter and continue as directed. In this procedure,
configuring the AT&amp;T StarLAN ISO Stack, the network adapter you choose
is not important because the network information is manually modified
in subsequent steps.
<P>
<P><h3>Pages E-16 and E-18: Configuring Microsoft DLC</h3>
 
<P>
The "Microsoft Windows for Workgroups Resource Kit" for version 3.1
contains a documentation error in Appendix E, pages E-16 and E-18,
under Configuring Microsoft DLC. The setting ti_tick_one=255, under
the [dlcxif] section, is repeated and incorrect. The setting should be
ti_tick_two=255. For example, a correct [dlcxif] section will contain:
<P>
<PRE>   [dlcxif]
   drivername=msdlc$
   bindings=ms$elnkii
   commands=24
   saps=8
   stations=20
   timers=12
   bufqelements=512
   t1_tick_one=10
   t1_tick_two=50
   ti_tick_one=255
   ti_tick_two=255

</PRE>This error is repeated again on page E-18, were a sample PROTOCOL.INI
file is shown.
<P>
<P><h3>README.WRI File: Incorrect Reference to SmartMon utility</h3>
 
<P>
The Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 README.WRI file contains the
following incorrect statement in Section 9.0, "Running Communications
Applications":
<P>
<PRE>   SMARTDrive may cause download errors when it clears the
   write-behind cache. If this happens, disable the SMARTDrive
   write-behind cache during high-speed downloads. This can be done
   easily using the SmartMon utility included in the Windows for
   Workgroups Resource Kit.

</PRE>This is incorrect. The SmartMon utility is included with the
"Microsoft Windows Resource Kit" for Windows 3.1, not the "Windows for
Workgroups Resource Kit."
<P>
For information about obtaining the "Microsoft Windows Resource Kit" for
version 3.1, call the Microsoft Sales Information Center (MSIC) at (800)
426-9400.
