<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article discusses some known problems with, current versions of,
and installation of the MicroField Graphics display driver, T8.DRV.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>GP Faults</h3>
 
<P>
Some versions of the MicroField Graphics display driver, T8.DRV, cause
general protection (GP) faults in Windows Resource Kit (WRK) for Windows
3.1 applications such as SMARTDrive Monitor (SMARTMON.EXE).
<P>
<P><h3>Version Information</h3>
 
<P>
MicroField has released five major versions of its display driver:
<P>
<PRE>   Version  Date
   -------  ----
   3.14     10/13/90
   3.21     03/04/91
   3.26     12/26/92
   3.30     02-24-92
   3.32     05-07-92

</PRE>Other minor releases were made between these major releases.
<P>
The MicroField installation program installs CHKVER.EXE in the Windows
directory. This program reports the version of the MicroField Graphics
display driver that is currently running.
<P>
MicroField Graphics recommends that all users upgrade to version 3.32 of
its driver. A minimum of version 3.30 is required for Windows 3.1, but
version 3.30 has problems with TrueType and PowerPoint.
<P>
<P><h3>Display Driver Installation</h3>
 
<P>
The MicroField Graphics documentation instructs you to install a VGA or
EGA display driver when installing Windows. After you have a functioning
installation of Windows, you can use the MicroField Graphics installation
program to install its drivers. The MicroField Graphics installation
program does not use the Windows Setup program, so if you are having
installation problems, you should contact MicroField Graphics for
assistance.
<P>
Obtaining Updated Display Drivers
 
<P>
MicroField Graphics customers can obtain the current drivers from
MicroField Graphics Sales.
<P>
For additional information, please contact MicroField.
