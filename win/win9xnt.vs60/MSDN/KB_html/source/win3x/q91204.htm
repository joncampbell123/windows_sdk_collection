<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In the Windows 3.1 StartUp group, applications load in left-to-right
sequence, with Windows-based applications taking precedence over MS-DOS-
based applications, regardless of the order in which they appear in the
StartUp group.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Windows 3.1 StartUp group starts Windows-based applications beginning
with the first icon in the group and moves from left to right, starting
each Windows-based application in the first line. It then moves down a
line, if applicable, and begins starting Windows-based applications in the
same fashion. Startup skips over any MS-DOS-based applications that are
placed between the Windows-based applications. If a switch appears on the
command line for a Windows-based application, then it will load after the
other Windows-based applications.
<P>
Startup then begins with the second MS-DOS-based application and moves from
left to right, skipping over the already running Windows-based
applications. After the last MS-DOS-based application in the StartUp group
is started, startup goes back and starts the first MS-DOS-based
application.
<P>
If the StartUp group contains MS-DOS-based applications only, startup
begins loading the second application and does not start the first
application in the group until the last application has been started.
