<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
A DLL (dynamic link library) file is an executable file that allows
applications to share code and other resources necessary to perform
particular tasks. Microsoft Windows provides DLL files that contain
functions and resources that allow Windows-based applications to
operate in the Windows environment.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
DLLs most often appear as files with a .DLL extension; however, they
may also have an .EXE or other extension. For example, SHELL.DLL
provides the OLE drag and drop routines the Windows and other programs
use.
<P>
KERNEL.EXE, USER.EXE, and GDI.EXE are examples of DLLs with .EXE
extensions. They provide code, data, or routines to applications
running in the Windows operating system. For example, one of these
files provides the "CreateWindow" function, which applications use
when they want to create a new window on the screen.
<P>
In Windows, an installable driver is also a DLL. An application can
open, enable, query, disable, and close the driver.
<P>
DLLs may be found in the WINDOWS directory, WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory,
or in an application's directory.
<P>
If an application is started and one of its DLL files is missing, the
error message "CANNOT FIND xxx.DLL FILE" will appear. If an
application is started with an outdated DLL file, the error message
"CALL TO UNDEFINED DYNALINK" will appear. In both situations, the
proper DLL file must be obtained and placed in the proper directory
for the application to run correctly.
