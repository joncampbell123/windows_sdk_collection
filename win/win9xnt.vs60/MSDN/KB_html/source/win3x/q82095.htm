The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the desktop wallpaper feature in the Windows 3.0 Control
Panel, the following error message may be displayed:
<P>
<PRE>   Unable to Use XXXX.BMP As a Desktop Bitmap

</PRE>where XXXX.BMP is the filename of a bitmap.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Any of the following can cause this problem:

<UL><LI>There is not enough free memory or free system resources to
   display the picture.

<LI>The picture is not a valid bitmap (.BMP) file.

<LI>The path to the bitmap is incorrect when selecting a bitmap from
   another directory.
<P>
</UL><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Verifying There Is Enough Memory</h3>
 
<P>
To verify that there is enough memory or resources, make sure that Windows
is not running in real mode. Real mode may not allocate enough free memory
or system resources to Windows to display a bitmap as a background
wallpaper. Large bitmaps, such as CHESS.BMP, cannot run in real mode.
Large bitmaps such as this CHESS.BMP require more free memory than is
likely to be available in real mode.
<P>
<P><h3>Verifying the Picture Is a Bitmap</h3>
 
<P>
To verify that the picture is a valid bitmap, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Load the file into Paintbrush.

<P><LI>Save the picture, as a bitmap called TEST.BMP, to the WINDOWS
   directory.

<P><LI>Run Control Panel and choose the Desktop icon.

<P><LI>In the Wallpaper section, select TEST.BMP. (Note: If Windows is
   running in real mode, you must restart Windows in order to see the
   new wallpaper.)
<P>
</OL><h3>Selecting a Bitmap as Wallpaper</h3>
 
<P>
To select a bitmap for use as wallpaper from another directory:

<OL><P><LI>Run Control Panel and choose the Desktop icon.

<P><LI>In the Wallpaper section, enter the complete path and filename of
   the bitmap. This will copy the bitmap to the Windows program
   directory and select it for use as a wallpaper. The bitmap must be
   copied because Windows looks for bitmaps located within the Windows
   program directory only.
<P></OL>
