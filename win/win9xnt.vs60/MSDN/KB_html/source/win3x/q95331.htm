The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Windows for Workgroups provides support for Novell
connectivity on Ethernet and token-ring network adapters. However, the
Microsoft implementation of the IPX protocol (MSIPX) only lets you
install Novell connectivity on one network adapter.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If you choose Novell NetWare as an additional network, Windows for
Workgroups adds the MSIPX drivers to your configuration. These drivers
are installed to the first network adapter in the list displayed in
the Network Adapters dialog box of the Control Panel (accessed by
choosing the Network icon and then choosing the Adapters button).
<P>
If your machine has more than one network adapter, the first adapter
chosen during the setup process is the adapter on which NetWare
connectivity will be supported.
<P>
If you want to support IPX on a different network adapter, the
adapters must be removed and reinstalled so that the desired adapter
is first on the list. To accomplish this, use the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Start Windows for Workgroups.

<P><LI>In the Main group, start Control Panel.

<P><LI>In the Control Panel window, choose the Network icon.

<P><LI>Choose the Networks button.

<P><LI>Under Other Networks in Use, select Novell NetWare.

<P><LI>Choose the Remove button.

<P><LI>Choose the OK button to close the Compatible Networks dialog box.

<P><LI>Choose the Adapters button.

<P><LI>Select a network adapter.

<P><LI>Press the Remove button.

<P><LI>Repeat steps 9 and 10 until you have removed all adapters.

<P><LI>Choose the Close button.

<P><LI>The following warning message is displayed:
<P>
       Windows for Workgroups will not provide workgroup features
       without a network adapter installed. Are you sure you want
       to continue without a network adapter installed?
<P>
    Choose the Yes button.

<P><LI>Choose the Adapters button to reenter the Network Adapters dialog
    box.

<P><LI>Choose the Add button.

<P><LI>Find the adapter that you want to use to connect to Novell NetWare
    resources, select it, and then press the OK button.

<P><LI>Add any adapters that were previously installed on the machine.

<P><LI>When you have added all the adapters you want to use, choose the
    OK button to close Adapters dialog box.

<P><LI>Choose the Networks button.

<P><LI>Under Available Netware Types, select Novell NetWare, and then
    press the Add button.

<P><LI>Choose the OK button to close the Network Settings dialog box.

<P><LI>Choose the OK button again.
<P>
</OL>Windows for Workgroups now warns you that you must reboot for the
changes to take effect. To do so, choose the Restart button.
