The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.1, 3.11
<LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
You may receive the following error message while running an MS-DOS-based
application under Windows or Windows for Workgroups:
<P>
<PRE>   EMM386 Exception Error #6

</PRE>This error message indicates that an MS-DOS-based application has caused
the processor to execute an invalid instruction.
<P>
Although the error message is provided by EMM386.EXE, it is not the cause,
nor is it directly related to the problem. The error is probably caused by
a corrupt .EXE file or a bad memory chip.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When Windows starts, it turns off EMM386.EXE but leaves its error handler
installed. When the CPU notifies Windows of a problem, it passes the error
to the default handler, which in this case is EMM386.EXE.
<P>
EMM386 Exception Error #6 indicates an "invalid opcode." According to
"Microsoft's 80386/80486 Programming Guide" second edition (pages 122-123),
this error can be caused by either of the following:

<UL><LI>The processor tries to decode a bit pattern that does not correspond
   to any legal machine instruction.

<LI>The processor tries to execute an instruction that contains invalid
   operands.
<P>
</UL>Both situations indicate the same thing--the CPU is trying to execute
instructions, but is being given random values from the wrong memory
location. This can be caused by one of the following:

<UL><LI>The application gave an invalid jump instruction, causing a jump to
   an invalid memory location.

<LI>The application gave a correct jump, but the memory it jumped to is
   corrupted.
<P>
</UL>The most likely cause of these problems is either a corrupted file (.EXE,
.DLL, or virtual device driver [VxD]) or a bad memory chip. If the problem
occurs on more than one distinct program, it is probably caused by a bad
memory chip. For example, if the problem occurs when you choose Open from
the File menu in Microsoft Windows Write and Microsoft Windows Notepad, the
error is probably being caused by a corrupted common dialog box .DLL file
(COMMDLG.DLL). But if the problem occurs in two applications that do not
share any .DLL files, the error is likely caused by a bad memory chip.
<P>
If you are using MS-DOS 6.2 or later or Windows for Workgroups version
3.11, you may be able to correct this problem by removing HIGHSCAN from the
EMM386.EXE command in your CONFIG.SYS file.
<P>
This error can also be caused by upper memory conflicts. See the following
article for more information:

</PRE><h3>Exception Error #6 with Microsoft Backup for Windows</h3>
 
<P>
If you receive the "EMM386 Exception Error #6" while you are running
Microsoft Backup for Windows, you may have an incompatible third-party
virtual device driver (VxD).
<P>
Use a text editor, such as Microsoft Windows Notepad, to edit the
[386Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file and use a semicolon to remark
out the following lines:
<P>
<PRE>   device=fastback.386

</PRE>-or-
<P>
<PRE>   device=virwt.386

</PRE>NOTE: VFINTD.386 is the virtual device driver for MS-DOS 6.x Backup
for Windows and should not be removed.
<P>
<P><h3>Exception Error #6 With Older Version of After Dark</h3>
 
<P>
This error can occur while running older version of Berkeley Systems' After
Dark with other applications (such as Intuit's Quicken) in Microsoft
Windows.
<P>
To solve the problem, remove After Dark.
