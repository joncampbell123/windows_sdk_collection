The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
32-Bit Disk Access should not be used on battery-operated portable
computers that implement power-saving features. Enabling 32-Bit Disk
Access on such machines can cause Microsoft Windows version 3.1 to stop
responding (hang).
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Enabling 32-Bit Disk Access causes Windows to access the system's hard
disk(s) using an Enhanced mode virtual device driver (VxD), which
accesses the controller hardware directly. To function correctly, the
disk controller must be completely compatible with the standard
Western Digital hard disk controller architecture. In most cases,
Setup and the VxD's own initialization code properly detects those
controllers that are not 100% compatible with the Western Digital
standard. The disk controllers used in portable computers are very
similar to Western Digital controllers but have extensions used for
power management, such as shutting down the disk drive when it hasn't
been used for a while or when the machine is placed in suspend mode by
the user (typically by pressing a button). Some machines, such as
Tandon notebook computers, change the state of the disk controller
when the power source is changed from line to battery. Basically, the
power management support can change the state of the disk controller
without notifying Windows.
<P>
Since there is no standard for this hardware, the 32-Bit Disk driver
cannot determine when power-management events have occurred or what to
do about them. If the driver determines the controller is in a
different state than it expected, it will produce an error message. If
this message is encountered, 32-Bit Disk Access should be turned off.
<P>
If Windows cannot be started in Enhanced mode while 32-Bit Disk Access
is enabled, Windows should be started with the command line,
<P>
<PRE>     WIN /D:F

</PRE>The switch temporarily disables 32-Bit Disk Access. 32-Bit Disk Access
should then be turned off permanently by using Control Panel's Virtual
Memory dialog box.
<P>
Controllers that support drive spin-down, such as Compaq's 386N
computers, should not use 32-Bit Disk Access for similar reasons.
<P>
NOTE: To avoid problems with these machines, 32-Bit Disk Access is
disabled by default. If the machine is not a portable and does not
support spin-down, then 32-Bit Disk Access can be enabled.
