The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11
</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
STB (Simply The Best) Systems video adapter required BIOS revisions
and general notes are listed below for:

<UL><LI>Windows 3.0 and 3.0a
<LI>Windows 3.1
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h2>WINDOWS 3.1</h2>
 
<P>
Simply The Best (STB) video cards operating with BIOS dates earlier
than those listed below may cause Windows 3.1 to stop responding
(hang) when running in enhanced mode. General protection (GP) faults
may occur in some applications. Standard mode works normally.
<P>
<PRE>STB Video Card         BIOS Version
--------------         ------------

Powergraph             2.2
Powergraph Ergo VGA    1.6
Powergraph Combo VGA   1.6
QuickVGA               1.0
VGA Extra-EM           1.73
VGA EM-16              1.33
Powerview Rev A.       1.4
Powerview Rev B.       1.5
VGA 800/16             1.81
AutoVGA                2.23

</PRE>The Video section of the MSD (Microsoft Diagnostics) utility can be
used to determine the video BIOS version. If this information is
incomplete, use the Memory Browser under the Utilities menu and select
Video ROM BIOS.
<P>
The following are notes on various types of STB cards.
<P>
<P><h3>Powergraph Series</h3>
 
<P>
The entire Powergraph series is based on the ET4000 video chip set and
will work with the TSENG drivers available on the Microsoft Download
Service (MSDL). Query on the following words in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base for more information about MSDL:
<P>
<PRE>   msdl and connect and genie

</PRE><h3>QuickVGA</h3>
 
<P>
The STB QuickVGA does not have a current driver for Windows 3.1.
<P>
<P><h3>VGA Extra-EM and Extra-EM16</h3>
 
<P>
The STB Extra-EM and EM-16 both require the EM-TRANS version 2.2. In
addition, STB has Windows 3.1 drivers available on its BBS. (See below
for BBS information.)
<P>
<P><h3>Powerview Series</h3>
 
<P>
The video BIOS on the STB Powerview cards are not interchangeable.
They are based on the ET4000 chip set, and will use the TSENG drivers
on the MSDL.
<P>
<P><h3>VGA 800/16 and AutoVGA</h3>
 
<P>
The STB 800/16 and AutoVGA do not have a Windows 3.1 video driver
available, and none are currently planned. The 800/16 is based upon
the Chips &amp; Technologies chip set, while the AutoVGA uses the Cirrus
chip set.
<P>
<P><h3>STB EGA</h3>
 
<P>
If your STB EGA card has a BIOS revision of 1.0, your system may stop
responding when you try to run a full-screen MS-DOS-based application
from enhanced mode Windows. This does not occur with an MS-DOS-based
application running in a window. STB EGA BIOS revision 1.13 does not
cause this behavior. Other STB EGA cards may have similar problems and
may require BIOS upgrades.
<P>
<P><h2>WINDOWS 3.0 and 3.0a</h2>
 
<P>
The following STB cards run with Windows 3.0:
<P>
<PRE>Card                   Notes
----                   -----

Powergraph VGA         Has a driver to support 1024 x 768 with 256
                       colors; this card needs at least 1 MB of
                       memory to support this video mode

Auto VGA               Uses a Microsoft driver for standard VGA

VGA Extra Em           Uses a Microsoft driver for standard VGA

VGA Em 16              Uses a Microsoft driver for standard VGA

</PRE>640 VGA and VGA 80/16  May require a BIOS upgrade from STB if the
<PRE>                       BIOS version is 1.78 or earlier

</PRE>The products included here are manufactured by vendors independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these
products' performance or reliability.
