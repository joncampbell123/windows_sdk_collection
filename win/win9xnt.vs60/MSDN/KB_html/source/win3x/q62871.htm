The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you manually copied the compressed files located on the Run-Time
ToolBook Setup Disk onto your hard disk, you may  receive the error
"Insufficient Memory to Run Application" when trying to click the
following files in the TOOLBOOK directory:
<P>
<PRE>   TBOOK.EXE
   DAYBOOK.TBK
   DBHELP.TBK
   TOURBOOK.TBK

</PRE><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
If you must set up DayBook by manually copying the files to the hard
drive, you must first decompress the files with the Windows EXPAND.EXE
program. This can be accomplished by doing the following:

<OL><P><LI>Place the Windows 3.0 Disk 2 into Drive A. From the MS-DOS prompt, type
   "A:" (without the quotation marks), then press ENTER.

<P><LI>Type "COPY EXPAND.EXE C:\" (without the quotation marks). This
   copies the EXPAND.EXE file to the root of Drive C.

<P><LI>Create a backup copy of the ToolBook disk(s), and delete the files
   TBKSETUP.EXE and TBKSETUP.INF from this backup.

<P><LI>Place the backup of the ToolBook Setup Disk into Drive A and type
   the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      EXPAND A: *.* C:\TOOLBOOK
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: This step requires that you have already created the TOOLBOOK
   directory on Drive C.

<P><LI>When all the files have been successfully decompressed and copied
   to Drive C, associate the file DAYBOOK.TBK with ToolBook. Page 135
   of the "Microsoft Windows User's Guide" describes how to associate
   files with applications.
<P>
</OL>The above steps does not create the icons or the group for the DayBook
application or the Introduction to ToolBook application. This can be
done by following the instructions listed on Pages 87-91 of the
"Microsoft Windows User's Guide."
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following steps outline the normal setup procedure for DayBook and
the Introduction to ToolBook. This setup automatically decompresses the
files and create icons, the group and associations for both applications.

<OL><P><LI>Make sure Windows 3.0 has been successfully installed and type
   "WIN" (without the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS prompt to start
   Windows.

<P><LI>Insert the Run-Time ToolBook Setup Disk into Drive A, and
   Type "A:" (without the quotation marks) to make Drive A active.

<P><LI>From the File menu, Choose Run from within the Program Manager.

<P><LI>Type A:\TBKSETUP and click OK.
