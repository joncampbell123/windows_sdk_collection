<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you save a file from Windows Write to a floppy disk, you may
encounter one or both of the following error messages:
<P>
<PRE>   Error Message 1
   ---------------

       &lt;drive&gt;:\&lt;filename&gt;
       Cannot find this file (or "cannot read this file")

   Where &lt;drive&gt;:\&lt;filename&gt; refers to the file that Windows is unable
   to locate or read.

   Error Message 2
   ---------------

      Either something has happened to the network or possibly the
      file has been renamed or moved. Do you want to try again?

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This error message occurs when the file that you attempt to save on a
floppy disk originated from a different floppy disk that has been
removed from the drive.
<P>
This error message occurs because Write needs to read from the file's
original source file in order to save the file to another destination.
In this case, since the disk was removed from drive A and another disk
was placed in the drive, the original source file cannot be found.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Since Write is unable to locate and read the source file, you must
either save the file to the hard drive with the original source disk
still in the floppy drive, or save the file first to the hard drive,
then save to another floppy disk.
<P>
Once the file is resident on the hard drive, Write has a permanent source
file that it can locate, read to memory, and save to a second floppy disk.
<P>
This situation does not occur if you saved TEST.WRI to the A drive,
replaced the floppy disk in the A drive, and attempted to save the document
to the hard drive again as TEST.WRI. This saving procedure works because
when the Write file was saved to the floppy disk, a temporary file was
written to the TEMP directory on the hard drive; Windows will locate and
read this file in order to save the file to the hard drive but it cannot
locate this file to save it to a floppy disk.
