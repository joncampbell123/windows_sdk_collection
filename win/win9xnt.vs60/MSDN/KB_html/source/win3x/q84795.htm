<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you run Microsoft Windows, incorrect or outdated dynamic link library
(.DLL) files can cause the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Call to Undefined Dynalink

</PRE>This article discusses several software products and files that can cause

</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Access Pack for Microsoft Windows</h3>
 
<P>
After you install Access Pack for Microsoft Windows (available on the
Windows Driver Library [WDL]), you may receive the "Call To Undefined
Dynalink" error message when you try to run one of the Access Pack
utilities.
<P>
The error occurs because one or more of the following conditions exist:

<UL><LI>The MOUSE.DRV= entry in the [BOOT] section of the SYSTEM.INI file
   points to the wrong mouse driver.
<LI>The KEYBOARD.DRV= entry in the [BOOT] section of the SYSTEM.INI file
   points the wrong keyboard driver.
<LI>The Access Pack mouse driver (AP-MOU.DRV) in your Windows SYSTEM
   subdirectory is not the current version.
<LI>The Access Pack keyboard driver (typically AP-KBD.DRV, AP-KBDHP.DRV, or
   AP-KBDOL.DRV) in your Windows SYSTEM subdirectory is not the current
   version.
<P>
</UL>If the MOUSE.DRV= entry in the [BOOT] section of the SYSTEM.INI file points
to anything other than AP-MOU.DRV, change it to read MOUSE.DRV=AP-MOU.DRV,
and then copy the AP-MOU.DRV file from the WDL disk to your Windows SYSTEM
subdirectory. For example, if Windows is installed in the C:\WINDOWS
directory and your WDL disk is in drive A, type the following at the MS-DOS
command prompt and then press ENTER:
<P>
<PRE>   copy a:\ap-mou.drv c:\windows\system

</PRE>If the KEYBOARD.DRV= entry in the [BOOT] section of the SYSTEM.INI file
points to KEYBOARD.DRV, KBDHP.DRV, or KBOLI,DRV, change it to point to the
appropriate Access Pack keyboard driver (AP-KBD.DRV, AP-KBDHP.DRV, or AP-
KBDOL.DRV), and then copy the corresponding file from the WDL disk to your
Windows SYSTEM subdirectory. For example, if Windows is installed in the
C:\WINDOWS directory, your WDL disk is in drive A, and you change your
KEYBOARD.DRV= entry from KEYBOARD.DRV to AP-KBD.DRV, type the following at
the MS-DOS command prompt and then press ENTER:
<P>
<PRE>   copy a:\ap-kbd.drv c:\windows\system

</PRE>NOTE: If your current keyboard driver is not AP-KBD.DRV, AP-KBDHP.DRV, or
AP-KBDOL.DRV, contact your mouse vendor to determine if it is compatible
with the Microsoft Mouse driver. If it is not, your mouse vendor may
provide Access Pack-compatible drivers.
<P>
If the MOUSE.DRV= entry in the [BOOT] section of the SYSTEM.INI file points
to the Access Pack mouse driver (AP-MOU.DRV), replace the file with the
correct mouse driver from the WDL disk. For example, if Windows is
installed in the C:\WINDOWS directory and your WDL disk is in drive A, type
"copy a:\ap-mou.drv c:\windows\system" (without the quotation marks) at the
MS-DOS command prompt and then press ENTER.
<P>
If the KEYBOARD.DRV= entry in the [BOOT] section of the SYSTEM.INI file
points to AP-KBD.DRV, AP-KBDHP.DRV, or AP-KBDOL.DRV, replace the file with
the correct keyboard driver from the WDL disk. For example, if Windows is
installed in the C:\WINDOWS directory, your WDL disk is in drive A, any you
are using AP-KBD.DRV, type "copy a:\ap-kbd.drv c:\windows\system" (without
the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS command prompt and then press ENTER.
<P>
NOTE: If the Access Pack keyboard drivers are installed properly, most
Access Pack features work correctly even if an improper mouse driver is
installed. However, the MouseKeys and SerialKeys features are disabled, and
you cannot run the Access Utility to customize the settings or view Help.

</PRE><h3>Ace File</h3>
 
<P>
The database program Ace File version 1.0 for Windows may cause a "Call to
Undefined Dynalink" error message when you choose Open from the File menu
and select Database. Ace Software can be contacted at (408) 451-0100.
<P>
There is currently no solution to this problem. Contact Ace Software for
an upgrade.
<P>
<P><h3>Artisoft LANtastic for Windows</h3>
 
<P>
You may receive a "Call to Undefined Dynalink" error message or "FatalExit
code=0x0404" if you are running an earlier version of the LANtastic version
3.0 install program WINSTALL.EXE.
<P>
These error messages occur if the date of the WINSTALL.EXE file is earlier
than 10/23/91. They do not occur if you use Windows 3.1 to update an
existing version of Windows 3.0 that was already configured for the
network.
<P>
To correct this problem, obtain an updated version of the WINSTALL.EXE
file by contacting LANtastic technical support.
<P>
<P><h3>Lasertools PCPanel</h3>
 
<P>
When running under Windows 3.1, the LaserTools utility Printer Control
Panel (PCPanel) may cause a "Call to Undefined Dynalink" error message.
<P>
PCPanel is produced by LaserTools and ships with some NEC printers, the
Texas Instruments MicroLaser, and Okidata Lasers.
<P>
PCPanel looks for HPPCL or PostScript data being sent to the printer and
then modifies the data being sent. This function may not work correctly
with Windows 3.1 and may cause error messages and/or printing problems.
<P>
This problem has been corrected in version 2.3 of PCPanel, and is
available from LaserTools.
<P>
To Obtain Version 2.3:
<P>
Current owners of PCPanel can receive a new copy by calling LaserTools at
(800) 995-6487. NEC Silentwriter owners who purchased their printer after
January 1, 1992 receive this upgrade free of charge. Silentwriter owners
who purchased their printers before January 1, 1992 are charged a $15.00
handling and shipping fee. The software upgrade center accepts popular
credit cards or a check by mail. The mailing address is:
<P>
<PRE>   NEC Redemption Center
   P.O. Box 3503,
   Wallingford, CT 06494

</PRE>The upgrade package includes installation instructions, and also revised
.WPD files for Silentwriter Model 95 usage with Windows 3.1. This 800
number is for SOFTWARE UPGRADES only, and is not a technical support
center.
<P>
NEC Bulletin Board System (BBS): (508) 635-4706
<P>
Temporary Workaround:
<P>
Until you receive the updated version of PCPanel, you can work around the
problem by removing PCPanel. The following paragraph is taken from the
"Printer Control Panel Owner's Manual":
<P>
<PRE>   If you install Printer Control Panel for Windows 3.0, certain
   information is added to your Windows 3.0 files. If you wish to
   remove that information from your working copy of Windows 3.0, you
   must use the Re-INSTALL program to do so. Simply choose the
   Remove PCPANEL From Windows selection from the Windows 3.0 menu
   in INSTALL. You'll want to remove Printer Control Panel as an
   application in Windows 3.0 also. Refer to Appendix A.

   NOTE: Appendix A shows how to delete the PCPanel icon.

</PRE>According to LaserTools technical support, you can remove the Printer
Control Panel with the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>In the PCPrinter or LaserTools directory, type:
<P>
<P><PRE>      install /u
</PRE>
<P><LI>Select "Skip this step without modifying the AUTOEXEC.BAT."

<P><LI>Choose Remove Printer Control Panel For Windows.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: The MS-DOS-based TSR can remain in place.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Dr. Watson</h3>
 
<P>
If you have an earlier version of TOOLHELP.DLL (dated before 3-10-92) in
your Windows directory, you will receive a "Call to Undefined Dynalink"
error message. When earlier versions of Dr. Watson were installed under
Windows 3.0, DRWATSON.EXE and TOOLHELP.DLL were installed into the Windows
directory. When Dr. Watson version 0.80 is installed during the
installation of Windows 3.1, DRWATSON.EXE is installed into the Windows
directory, and TOOLHELP.DLL is installed into the Windows\SYSTEM directory.
To correct this problem, delete the TOOLHELP.DLL file from the Windows
directory.
<P>
NOTE: This problem can also occur with an earlier version of SHELL.DLL (see
below), OLECLI.DLL, OLESVR.DLL, and COMMDLG.DLL. All these files should be
located in the Windows\SYSTEM directory and should be dated 3/10/92 or
later.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft LAN Manager</h3>
 
<P>
If you receive a "Call to Undefined Dynalink" error message when starting
Windows 3.1 with Microsoft LAN Manager loaded, you most likely have
outdated versions of LAN Manager network dynamic link libraries (DLLs).
Using the proper versions of the DLLs corrects the problem.
<P>
Normally, the original DLLs, NETAPI.DLL and PMSPL.DLL, are in the NETPROG
subdirectory of the LAN Manager directory and they are updated in place.
The original DLLs are backed up to NETAPI.BAK and PMSPL.BAK. To prevent the
destruction of the original files when multiple installations or updates
take place, the files are not updated if the .BAK files are already
present.
<P>
The problem can result from a variety of causes:

<UL><LI>If the backup files are present but the DLLs are out of date, then
   the files are not updates and the out-of-date DLLs are used.

<LI>If the LAN Manager directory isn't found during setup, but the
   out-of-date DLLs are in the path, they are used.

<LI>If Windows was set up for a different network, and you changed to
   LAN Manager 2.0 from Windows Setup in maintenance mode, the drivers
   aren't copied correctly. MS-DOS maintenance mode Setup copies the
   files correctly.
<P>
</UL>The LAN Manager 2.0 files are called NETAPI20.DLL and PMSPL20.DLL on
the Windows disks. They may be present in the system directory in some
cases. If the files are not, they can be expanded from the Windows disks
using the EXPAND utility. These files should be copied to the NETPROG
subdirectory of the LAN Manager directory and renamed to NETAPI.DLL and
PMSPL.DLL.
<P>
Note that these LAN Manager 2.0 DLLs should NOT be used with LAN Manager
2.1. The DLLs and drivers provided with LAN Manager 2.1 should be used. If
the error message results on a LAN Manager 2.1 configuration, NETAPI.DLL
and PMSPL.DLL may have been overwritten by LAN Manager 2.0 libraries and
should be expanded from the LAN Manager 2.1 disks. This can occur if you
specified LAN Manager 2.0 as your network when installing Windows 3.1 and
then changed to LAN Manager 2.1. This will happen most likely when using
batch mode installations on dissimilar machines. If the .BAK files are
larger than the .DLL files, then this has probably occurred.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft SHELL.DLL File (Program Item Properties Dialog)</h3>
 
<P>
Choosing the Change Icon button in the Program Item Properties dialog
box in Windows 3.1 may cause the "Call to Undefined Dynalink" error
message if the SHELL.DLL file is dated earlier than 3-10-92:
<P>
To update the SHELL.DLL file:

<OL><P><LI>Expand the SHELL.DLL file from the original Windows 3.1 disks (Disk
   4 of the 1.44-MB 3.5-inch disk set, or Disk 5 of the 1.2- MB
   5.25-inch disk set) to the Windows\SYSTEM directory. To do this, at
   the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following
<P>
<P><PRE>      expand [drive1]:\shell.dl_ [drive2]:\windows\system\shell.dll
</PRE><P>
   where "drive1" is the drive designating the location of the Windows
   3.1 disk, and "drive2" is the drive on which Windows 3.1
   is installed.

<P><LI>Remove any SHELL.DLL files that may exist in the Windows directory.
<P>
</OL><h3>Microsoft Printer Drivers</h3>
 
<P>
The "Call to Undefined Dynalink" error message may occur if Windows version
3.1 attempts to use a Windows version 3.0 printer driver. You must remove
the Windows version 3.0 printer driver and install the Windows version 3.1
printer driver to correct the problem.
<P>
NOTE: You must remove duplicate printer driver entries from the Installed
Printers list or you will be unable to install a new Windows version 3.1
printer driver from the Windows disks.
<P>
Be sure to search all drives and directories for outdated printer drivers.
This is especially important if you are running on a network, where printer
drivers may be stored in multiple directories.
<P>
<P><h3>Novell NetWare Utilities</h3>
 
<P>
When you start Windows for Workgroups, the wallpaper appears, the "Call to
Undefined Dynalink" error message flashes on the screen, and you return to
an MS-DOS prompt.
<P>
If you have the Novell NetWare Tools for Windows installed and their files
are dated earlier than 1992 you need to update the utilities.
<P>
<P><h3>Powersoft Powerbuilder</h3>
 
<P>
Using Powersoft PowerBuilder 1.0a with Windows 3.1 may result in a "Call to
Undefined Dynalink" error message. PowerBuilder uses a custom version of
TOOLHELP.DLL. This design is not compatible with the TOOLHELP.DLL file
shipped with Windows 3.1.
<P>
To run PowerBuilder successfully with Windows 3.1, please contact Powersoft
for a PowerBuilder update.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Bookshelf for Windows 1994, 1995, 1996-97</h3>
 
<P>
For information pertaining to this error message with the versions of
Bookshelf listed above, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base.
