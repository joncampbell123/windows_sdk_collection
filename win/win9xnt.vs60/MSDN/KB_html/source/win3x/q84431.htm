The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows with Multimedia Extensions version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The Sounds option under the Settings menu in the Alarm Clock program
is unavailable (dimmed). Alarm Clock is located in the Accessories
group and comes with Microsoft Windows with Multimedia Extensions
version 1.0.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
If the file WINCOM.DLL is not in the path, is missing, or is
corrupted, the Sounds option is unavailable.
<P>
The WINCOM.DLL file is necessary for playing .WAV sound files through
the Sounds option. The WINCOM.DLL file should have a size of 38800
bytes with a date of 8/14/91 and is normally located in the
Windows\SYSTEM directory. The size and date were taken from the
WINCOM.DLL file included with the "generic" version of Multimedia
Extensions 1.0 and does not reflect any changes made by other vendors.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 
<P>
Perform one of the following:

<OL><P><LI>Move the WINCOM.DLL to a directory that is not in the path.
<P>
   -or-

<P><LI>Delete the WINCOM.DLL file.
<P>
   -or-

<P><LI>Corrupt the WINCOM.DLL file by typing the following commands at the
   MS-DOS command prompt
<P>
<P><PRE>       copy /b &lt;filename&gt;+wincom.dll wincom.dl
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       rename wincom.dl wincom.dll
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    where &lt;filename&gt; is the name of a file. For example:
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       copy /b config.sys+wincom.dll wincom.dl
</PRE><P>
   The Copy command combines the source &lt;filename&gt; with the
   WINCOM.DLL file, thus creating a corrupt file called WINCOM.DL. Use
   the Rename command to rename the WINCOM.DL to WINCOM.DLL.
<P>
</OL>Each of these methods results in an unavailable (dimmed) Sounds option
in Alarm Clock.
