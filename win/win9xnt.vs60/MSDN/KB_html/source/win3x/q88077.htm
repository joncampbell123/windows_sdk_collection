<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Symantec technical support has confirmed that when you use version 2.0
of Norton Desktop for Windows with Windows 3.1 and a Microsoft LAN
Manager 2.1 Enhanced network, you may not be able to disconnect from
network drives.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If you are using Desktop for Windows 2.0 as the shell for Windows 3.1
and have installed the LAN Manager 2.1 Enhanced network driver, you
may not be able to disconnect from network drives when choosing
Disconnect Net Drive from the Disk Menu of Desktop for Windows 2.0.
<P>
Page 4-7 of the "Norton Desktop for Windows User's Guide" for version
2.0 states that when you choose this option:
<P>
<PRE>   Either the Disconnect Network Drive dialog box or the Network
   Connections dialog box appears, depending on your network and
   which version of Windows you are running."

</PRE>When using Windows 3.1 with the LAN Manager 2.1 Enhanced network
driver installed, the Disconnect Network Drive dialog box should
appear. Instead, the Connect Network Drive dialog box appears.
<P>
Symantec has confirmed that this to be a problem with Desktop for
Windows 2.0. Symantec/Norton Desktop for Windows developers are
currently studying the problem and plan to have a correction or update
available soon.
