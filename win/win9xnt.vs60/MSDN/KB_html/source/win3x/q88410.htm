The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.1, 3.11
<LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you start Microsoft Windows or Windows for Workgroups, you receive one
of the following error messages:

<UL><LI>The Microsoft Windows 32-bit disk driver (WDCTRL) cannot be loaded.
   There is unrecognizable disk software installed on this computer.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>The Microsoft Windows 32-bit disk driver (WDCTRL) cannot be loaded.
   There is a conflict with another virtual device.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>This application has tried to access the hard disk in a way
   that is incompatible with the Windows 32-bit disk access feature
   (WDCTRL). This may cause the system to become unstable.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>The Microsoft Windows 32-bit disk driver (WDCTRL) cannot be loaded.
   There is unrecognizable disk software installed on this computer.
   The address that MS-DOS uses to communicate with the hard disk has
   been changed. Some software, such as disk-caching software, changes
   this address. If you aren't running such software, you should run a
   virus-detection program to make sure the computer is virus free. To
   continue starting Windows without using the 32-bit disk driver, press
   any key.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The above error messages can be displayed when:

<UL><LI>The system is infected with a virus.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>You are running the PC Cillin anti-virus program.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>The Device=*WDCTRL entry occurs more than once in [386Enh] section of
   the SYSTEM.INI file.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>You are using a third-party replacement for WDCTRL and you have
   reinstalled Windows.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>You are loading a real-mode driver in the CONFIG.SYS file that alters
   the manner in which Windows monitors and controls INT 13h.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Using a QD6500A VLB controller that was installed in Windows 3.1 and
   then installing WFW 3.11.  After the install there will be an *int13,
   WDCTRL, and QDICTRL.386 in [386Enh] section of system.ini.  QDICTRL.386
   alone breaks the IFSHLP.SYS. Remark out the  QDICTRL.386 line and use
   the WDCTRL. Leave the QD6500.SYS line in the config.sys.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>The System Is Infected with a Virus</h3>
 
<P>
During startup, if Windows detects that a particular undocumented interrupt
has been hooked by a "program" it does not recognize, Windows displays one
of the above messages. Quite often, the program it does not recognize is a
virus. The Stoned, Bloomington, and Form viruses can cause these errors.
<P>
To correct this problem, run virus-detection software to detect and remove
any viruses from the hard disk drive. The Anit-CMOSa virus will also cause
this; McAfee v2.14 will find, but not cure it.
<P>
<P><h3>You Are Running the PC Cillin Anti-Virus Program</h3>
 
<P>
PC Cillin anti-virus software can cause these error messages. For more
information on PC Cillin and problems with Windows, query on the following
words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   pc cillin and windows

</PRE>You Are Using a Third-Party Replacement
<P><h3>for WDCTRL and You Have Reinstalled Windows</h3>
 
<P>
If you have a Western Digital Caviar 2540 hard disk drive (or another model
that uses WDCDRV.386 as a replacement for WDCTRL) and you reinstall Windows
to the same directory, Windows puts WDCTRL in the SYSTEM.INI file but does
not remove the third-party driver. Removing the DEVICE=*WDCTRL entry from
the SYSTEM.INI file corrects this problem.
<P>
You are Loading a Real-Mode Driver in the CONFIG.SYS File That
<P><h3>Alters the Manner in Which Windows Monitors and Controls INT 13h</h3>
 
<P>
Real-mode drivers that manipulate the way in which INT13 calls are handled
may prevent the 32-bit disk access driver from loading.
