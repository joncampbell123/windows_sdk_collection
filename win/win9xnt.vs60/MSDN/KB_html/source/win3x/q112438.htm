           =================================================

</PRE>Windows has built-in support for the two-handed Dvorak keyboard
layout, which may be useful for preventing or coping with some types
of repetitive motion injuries associated with typing. To use this
layout, choose the International icon in Control Panel.
<P>
Two additional layouts are designed for people who type with the left
hand only or with the right hand only. These layouts can also be
useful for people who type with a single finger or a wand. Since these
layout are not compatible with Windows 3.0, you need to update to a
later version of Windows before installing them. The single-handed
layouts are included with the PSS Application Note GA0650, "Dvorak
Keyboard Layouts." If you have a modem, you can download GA0650 from
the network services listed in the previous section. The filename is
GA0650.ZIP, except on MSDL, where this Application Note is available
in the self-extracting file GA0650.EXE.

       PRODUCTS FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE BLIND OR HAVE LOW VISION
      ==========================================================

</PRE>If you are blind or have low vision, many products are available to
help you use Windows. For persons with low vision, there are several
screen-enlargement utilities. For blind individuals, there are screen
readers that provide alternative output by synthesized voice or
refreshable Braille displays. Screen readers for Windows 3.0 are not
available. If you need this type of product to use Windows, you need
to upgrade to Windows 3.1 or Windows for Workgroups version 3.1.
<P>
For more information on the products available, see the "Getting More
Information" section of this Application Note. For more information
about customizing Windows for individuals with low vision, see the
following section.
<P>
<P>
<PRE>    CUSTOMIZING WINDOWS 3.0 WITHOUT ADDITIONAL HARDWARE OR SOFTWARE
    ===============================================================

</PRE>There are many ways you can adjust the appearance and behavior of
Windows to suit varying eyesight and motor skills without any
additional software or hardware. For example, by changing settings in
your WIN.INI and SYSTEM.INI files, you can control screen colors, font
sizes, and mouse behavior. You can change these settings in Control
Panel or by directly modifying the files. The following sections
describe how to identify which settings to modify to achieve the
desired results and how to safely modify the WIN.INI, SYSTEM.INI, and
other Windows initialization files.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>Modifying Initialization Files</h2>
 
<P>
Windows initialization files (.INIs) contain information about your
system environment. For example, the WIN.INI file contains settings
about your Windows environment, and the SYSTEM.INI file contains
settings that tell Windows about your system's hardware needs.
<P>
You can configure Windows and Windows-based applications to meet your
needs and preferences by modifying the information stored in these
files. For more information about WIN.INI and SYSTEM.INI, refer to the
WININI.TXT, WININI2.TXT, SYSINI.TXT, SYSINI2.TXT, and SYSINI3.TXT
files located in your Windows directory. You can print or view these
files from Microsoft Windows Notepad.
<P>
<PRE>   IMPORTANT: Errors made when editing initialization files can lead
   to undesirable results when you run Windows. Before changing any
   entry, make a backup copy of your original file. Also, some text
   editors can damage characters that have ANSI values greater than
   127. To avoid these problems, we recommend that you use Control
   Panel or Setup whenever possible to make changes. If you must edit
   the file, use a text editor such as Microsoft Windows Notepad,
   System Configuration Editor (SYSEDIT.EXE), or MS-DOS Editor.

</PRE>To change .INI file entries with a text editor:

<OL><P><LI>Create a backup copy of the .INI file you want to edit. For
   example, run File Manager and copy WIN.INI to WIN.BAK.

<P><LI>Open the .INI file with a text editor, such as Notepad.

<P><LI>Edit the specific entries and save the file.

<P><LI>Restart Windows so that the changes take effect.
<P>
</OL>The next four sections of this Application Note discuss the
initialization file entries you can change to achieve the specific
results you want. Many of the initialization file entries discussed
below are not present in the WIN.INI file by default but you can
easily add them with a text editor.
<P>
Changing Colors
 

<UL><LI>If you have trouble differentiating the system colors, or if they
   cause eyestrain, you can adjust them in the Colors dialog box of
   Control Panel.

<LI>If the desktop pattern or wallpaper causes eyestrain, you can
   adjust them in the Desktop dialog box of Control Panel.

<LI>If you have trouble differentiating the colors used by Windows
   Help, you can adjust them by using the IFJumpColor, IFPopupColor,
   JumpColor, MacroColor, and PopupColor entries in the [Windows Help]
   section of the WIN.INI file. The syntax for these entries is
<P>
<P><PRE>      &lt;entry&gt;=red &lt;value&gt; green &lt;value&gt; blue &lt;value&gt;
</PRE><P>
   where the &lt;value&gt; is a number from 000 to 999, with 999 giving the
   highest intensity. You must include three digits for each value,
   and you must include each color value. You can experiment with this
   setting to create a color that works best for you. The following
   table lists some colors you can work with:
<P>
<PRE>   Setting          Resulting color
</PRE></OL> 
<P>
<PRE>   000 000 999      Blue
   000 999 000      Green
   999 000 000      Red
   999 999 000      Yellow
   999 000 999      Magenta

</PRE></UL><h3>Changing Fonts</h3>
 

<UL><LI>If you have trouble reading the Windows system fonts (which are
   used to display window titles, menus, and dialog boxes), you can
   increase the font size using the FIXEDFON.FON, FONTS.FON, and
   OEMFONTS.FON entries in the [boot] section of the SYSTEM.INI file.
   However, you should replace the default fonts only with other
   system font files supplied with Windows. These fonts include
   8514FIX.FON, 8514SYS.FON, and 8514OEM.FON.
<P>
   For example, if you are using a VGA video driver, your .FON files
   are probably set as follows:
<P>
<P><PRE>      fixedfon.fon=vgafix.fon
      fonts.fon=vgasys.fon
      oemfonts.fon=vgaoem.fon
</PRE><P>
   To increase the size of the system font, expand 8514FIX.FON,
   8514SYS.FON, and 8514OEM.FON from the original Windows disks to
   your Windows program directory (usually C:\WINDOWS). For example,
   type the following command at the MS-DOS command prompt, and then
   press ENTER:
<P>
<P><PRE>      expand a:\8514fix.fon c:\windows\system\8514fix.fon
</PRE><P>
   Then, edit the [boot] section of your SYSTEM.INI file to read:
<P>
<P><PRE>      fixedfon.fon=8514FIX.FON
      fonts.fon=8514SYS.FON
      oemfonts.fon=8514OEM.FON
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    WARNING: Do not use font files other than the system .FON fonts
    supplied with Windows.
</PRE><P>
  - If you have trouble reading small fonts used by some applications,
   you can restrict the fonts available to Windows-based applications
   by removing the fonts you do not want in the Fonts dialog box of
   Control Panel. You do not need to actually delete the font files.
   If you remove all the fonts, only the system fonts remain available
   to applications.
<P>
<P><PRE>    NOTE: You may also need to adjust the icon spacing in the Desktop
    dialog box of Control Panel and choose Arrange Icons from the
    Window menu in Program Manager to make all your icon titles
    visible.
</PRE>
<LI>If you have trouble locating the text-selection cursor (also known
   as the caret or insertion bar) in your applications, you can adjust
   the rate at which it flashes. To do this, choose the Desktop icon
   in Control Panel.
<P>
</UL><h3>Changing Mouse Behavior</h3>
 

<UL><LI>If you have difficulty controlling the Microsoft Mouse, you can
   adjust its speed in the Mouse dialog box of Control Panel.

<LI>If you have trouble positioning the mouse on window frames so that
   you can adjust the size of the windows, you can increase the window
   border width setting in the Desktop dialog box of Control Panel.
<P>
</UL><h3>Changing Keyboard Behavior</h3>
 

<UL><LI>If you have trouble using the keyboard because of the speed at
   which it repeats, you can adjust this setting in the Keyboard
   dialog box of Control Panel. (You can adjust keyboard settings even
   further using Access Pack for Microsoft Windows, which is described
   later on in this Application Note.)
<P>
   KeyboardSpeed establishes how much time elapses between repetitions
   of a character on the display when you hold down a keyboard key
   (the default is 31 milliseconds).

<LI>You can use Windows Recorder to automate common tasks. For more
   information about using Recorder, run Recorder and choose Contents
   from the Help menu to open Recorder Help.

<LI>You can use two methods to reduce the number of keystrokes required
   to switch between applications. You can use Task List to display a
   list of all applications currently running, or you can assign a
   shortcut key to each MS-DOS-based application (as long as Windows
   is running in 386 enhanced mode). Task List can be invoked by
   pressing CTRL+ESC, or by choosing Switch To from any application's
   Control menu. Application shortcut keys for MS-DOS-based
   applications can be assigned by creating a .PIF file for the
   application only when Windows 3.0 is running in 386 enhanced mode.
   For more information on Task List and shortcut keys, see the
   "Microsoft Windows User's Guide."
