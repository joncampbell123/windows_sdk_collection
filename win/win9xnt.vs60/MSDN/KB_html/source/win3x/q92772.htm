The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Arcnet network interface cards based on the Standard Microsystems
Corporation (SMC) 90C65 controller chip may generate the "No Files
Found" error when you attempt to view a directory of a network drive
in File Manager with Microsoft Windows for Workgroups (WFWG).
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
There is no work around for this problem. The only correction is a
hardware modification to the card. Contact the manufacturer of the
network card for specific information on upgrading the affected chip.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If a network card with this chip is used on a Windows for Workgroups
server with the NetBEUI protocol, a Windows for Workgroups workstation
can browse and successfully connect to the server, but the "No Files
Found" error is generated even though there are files in the shared
directory. Other symptoms of this problem are the inability to run:

<UL><LI>Novell's TurboKit drivers
<LI>Artisoft's Lantastic SMCARC drivers
<LI>Possibly other NetBEUI protocol networking software products
<P>
</UL>The SMC120 Arcnet card uses their top-of-the-line ASL30519 Arcnet
controller chip. The SMC 90C65 Arcnet Controller Chip contains a
subset of the instructions in SMC's ASL30519 Arcnet Controller Chip.
The 90C65 chip is used in several OEM Arcnet network interface cards,
but is not used in any SMC Arcnet boards.
