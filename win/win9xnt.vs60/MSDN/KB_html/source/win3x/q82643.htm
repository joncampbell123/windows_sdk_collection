<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Windows version 3.1, Terminal and other Windows
communications applications work as described in the following
paragraphs.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 

<OL><P><LI>Applications open and initialize an available communications port
   using the standard Windows application program interface (API).
   Windows keeps track of what ports are in use by other
   applications, and will return an error code if a requested port is
   already in use.
<P>
   Windows applications do not need to know how to access specific
   types of communications hardware; this is handled in a device
   independent fashion by the communications API and driver.
<P>
   Windows applications can select bit rates up to 57.6 kilobits per second
   (Kbps) via the communications API.

<P><LI>Windows applications send/receive data to/from the COM port using
   the standard Windows API documented in the SDK.
<P>
   To service active port connections, Windows applications should
   set a timer or use the EnableCommNotification() API.
   EnableCommNotification() will send a window message to the
   application when data buffers are filled or empty. This prevents
   the application from unnecessarily clogging the system when
   waiting for data transmissions. Applications should NOT rely on
   PeekMessage() when servicing open ports.

<P><LI>Windows sends/receives application data to/from the communications
   driver (COMM.DRV). In Windows 3.1, the data is sent and received
   between Windows and the driver in blocks, rather than individual
   characters. This reduces transmission overhead and improves
   performance. Windows 3.00 used individual characters.

<P><LI>The communications driver sends/receives data to/from the COM
   port. The COM driver supports 8250 compatible universal
   asynchronous receiver transmitters (UARTs). Also, the Windows 3.1
   COM driver enables the FIFO buffer of 16550A compatible UARTs in
   order to reduce interrupt overhead and improve data throughput.
   Special communications devices may require a replacement
   communications driver to support extra features or a different
   hardware interface.

<P><LI>In enhanced mode, the virtual communications device (VCD)
   virtualizes COM port hardware to arbitrate access by multiple
   applications. The VCD notifies virtual machines (VMs) when their
   COM ports require servicing.
<P>
   In enhanced mode, COMBUFF buffers data between the communications
   driver and physical port. This prevents multitasking applications
   from losing data when they do not currently have CPU time.

<P><LI>Finally, data is received and transmitted by the physical COM port
   to/from the attached device (for example, modem, direct
   connection, fax card, and so on.). Some COM ports have onboard
   data buffers, such as those using the 16550A UART, to improve
   communications throughput and reduce errors.
