The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Eagle technical support reports that Windows for Workgroups does not work
when you use either the Windows for Workgroups drivers supplied with the
Novell/Eagle NE200 PCMCIA Ethernet cards or the drivers Eagle distributes
on its bulletin board service (BBS). The Novell/Eagle EP2000 Plus also
doesn't work with NDIS drivers.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Driver Disks Supplied with NE200 Card</h3>
 
<P>
At least some of the driver disks that Eagle distributes with the NE200
PCMCIA card incorrectly supply an OEMSETUP.INF file for the Eagle NE3210
card, which uses entirely different drivers and settings than the NE200.
<P>
<P><h3>Drivers Supplied on Eagle BBS</h3>
 
<P>
Even though the disk that Eagle distributes on its BBS includes an improved
OEMSETUP.INF file, the supplied NDIS driver still does not load
successfully under Windows for Workgroups.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Eagle is aware of these problems and is working on solutions. You can
contact Eagle Technical Services at (800) 726-5267.
