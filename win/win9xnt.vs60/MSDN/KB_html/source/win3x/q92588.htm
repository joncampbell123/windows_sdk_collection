The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 uses share-level security. As a
result, when you type a password to start the network, the only
purpose this serves is to provide access to the network from the
workstation.
<P>
The access granted provides reconnection services to shares to
which the workstation was previously connected. If these connections
were password protected on a share-level basis, then these passwords
were saved in a password cache and are only accessible if
the correct password was entered when the network was started. You
must type the correct password for a given user name, or the network
does not start.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If an alternate user name is typed at the login prompt, then the
reconnection services are still provided, but you are prompted to
enter a password to any shares that are secured by one. If you do not
know the share password, then you are not allowed to reconnect.
<P>
When using LAN Manager connectivity with Windows for Workgroups,
user-level security is implemented for all LAN Manager servers. If
there is a server available during logon, then it validates the user
by checking for the correct user name and user-level password. If the
user is not validated during logon, then any LAN Manager server that
is set up to use user-level security validates the user name and
user-level password before it allows connection. If you do not give
the correct password, you can connect but only with guest privileges.
<P>
User-level security is implemented when a server is set up with
restrictions that govern who can access the server. These
restrictions, may include the time of day that the user has access to
the server, the files and subdirectories the user may access, and the
level of rights the user is granted (such as read, write, create, and
delete).
<P>
Share-level security serves to restrict connections to a specified
drive that has been set up as a share. Security is established by
assigning a password to the drive. There are two levels of privileges
that can be granted: read only and full access.
<P>
Windows for Workgroups has built-in functionality to store passwords
to shares that are secured by a password. This feature is optional,
and is only implemented when the user chooses to enter a password when
starting the network. Null is a valid password and if used, the user
is not prompted for the password. It is only implemented for LAN
Manager logon if the user selects the check box that saves the
password in the password cache.
<P>
If password caching is enabled, Windows for Workgroups saves the LAN
Manager logon and user-level passwords in the cache so that the next
time the user tries to log on or connect to a server the user is not
prompted for the password. It is also possible to choose not to save
an individual connection's password. Within File Manager this is done
by clearing the option that saves the password in the password cache.
Password saving can also be prevented when making the connection at
the MS-DOS command prompt by using the SAVEPW:NO command. For example,
type:
<P>
<PRE>   net use \\server\share password \savepw:no

</PRE>To disable password caching and prevent your PWL file from being accessed,
add the following line to the [NETWORK] section of the System.ini file:
<P>
<PRE>   PasswordCaching=no
</PRE>
