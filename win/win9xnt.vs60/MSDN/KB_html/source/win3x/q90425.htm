The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Workgroup Connections version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Windows for Workgroups and Workgroup Connections support
Microsoft LAN Manager Logon scripts. This feature is supported when
running Windows for Workgroups if LAN Manager has been installed as a
secondary network through the Networks option in Control Panel.
<P>
To support LAN Manager Logon scripts with Workgroup Connections, you
must make some changes to your configuration.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To enable this feature with Workgroup Connections or when starting the
real-mode redirector from Windows for Workgroups, perform the following
modifications to your configuration:

<OL><P><LI>When starting the real-mode redirector, use the FULL redirector
   by issuing the following command when starting the network:
<P>
<P><PRE>      net start full
</PRE>
<P><LI>Edit the SYSTEM.INI file, and add the following lines to the
   [Network] section
<P>
<P><PRE>      LMLogon=Yes
      LogonDomain=&lt;Domain name&gt;
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;Domain name&gt; is the LAN Manager Domain that you have
   an account on and want to logon to at startup.
<P>
   NOTE: NET.EXE only reads the LMLogon=line with a value of YES or NO.
   Zero (0) and one (1) are not acceptable values for this setting.
<P>
</OL>The SYSTEM.INI file for Windows for Workgroups is normally in the
WINDOWS directory.
<P>
The SYSTEM.INI for Workgroup Connections is normally in the directory
in which Workgroup Connections was installed (that is, C:\DOS\NET).
