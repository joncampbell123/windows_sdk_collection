The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft WinLogin version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
To install Microsoft WinLogin with Windows for Workgroups, you must
follow the procedures in this article for all computers that will be
running the WinLogin application.
<P>
NOTE: These procedures only work with a Windows for Workgroups network
or Microsoft LAN Manager network, as they can connect through the
MS-DOS level before starting Windows for Workgroups.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Make the following changes for each computer that will be running
Windows for Workgroups and WinLogin:

<OL><P><LI>From your Windows for Workgroups Disk 3 (either 5.25-inch or
   3.5-inch disks), expand a copy of the MSNET.DR_ file and place this
   file in the WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory.
<P>
   Type the following command at the MS-DOS command prompt to expand
   the file:
<P>
<P><PRE>      expand x:\MSNET.DR_ c:\windows\system\msnet.drv
</PRE><P>
   where x is the floppy drive that contains the MSNET.DR_ file.

<P><LI>In the [BOOT] section of the SYSTEM.INI file, change the following
   line:
<P>
<P><PRE>      NETWORK.DRV=WFWNET.DRV
</PRE><P>
   to:
<P>
<P><PRE>      NETWORK.DRV=MSNET.DRV
</PRE>
<P><LI>In the [386Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file, comment out the
   following line:
<P>
<P><PRE>      NETWORK=VNETBIOS.386,VNETSUP.386,VREDIR.386,VSERVER.386,
      VBROWSE.386,VWC.386
</PRE><P>
   by placing a semicolon (;) as the first character, as follows:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ;NETWORK=VNETBIOS.386,VNETSUP.386,VREDIR.386,VSERVER.386,
      VBROWSE.386,VWC.386
</PRE>
<P><LI>Add the following line to the [386Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI
   file:
<P>
<P><PRE>      NETWORK=*VNETBIOS,*DOSNET
</PRE>
<P><LI>(Optional) To keep the WinLogin application transparent to users,
   you may want to add the following as the last line in the
   AUTOEXEC.BAT file:
<P>
<P><PRE>      net start enhanced
</PRE><P>
   This starts the MS-DOS redirector without any intervention from the
   user, and after the computer is started, the user needs to type a
   user name and password only. The user can then start Windows for
   Workgroups (along with the WinLogin application).

<P><LI>To install the WinLogin Client Software, you must first log in at
   the MS-DOS level and connect to the server\share locations where
   WinLogin is installed before you start Windows for Workgroups.

<P><LI>Start Windows for Workgroups. You will receive an error message
   stating that you do not have network connections because you are
   using the MSNET.DRV driver.

<P><LI>Start File Manager. You will not have Network options; however, you
   will see the network drives that you connected to before starting.

<P><LI>Install the Client software from either a disk drive or network
   drive.
<P>
</OL>Once the software is installed, you must do one of the following to
have all Windows for Workgroups functionality returned:

<UL><LI>Edit the SYSTEM.INI file in the users directory and remove the
   remarks from steps 2, 3, and 4 above.
<P>
</UL>-or-

<UL><LI>Using the INI Editor, add to the WinLogin database the lines in
   SYSTEM.INI that reflect Windows for Workgroups entries (steps 2, 3,
   and 4 above).
<P>
</UL>Once the changes have been made, you have full functionality of both
WinLogin and Windows for Workgroups. You can share resources as well
as connect to shared resources.
<P>
It is not necessary to create a persistent connection to the server
containing the WinLogin database because the WinLogin application can
connect and disconnect as necessary.
