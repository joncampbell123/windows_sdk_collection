<P>
This article contains information about the use of Windows for Workgroups
with third-party products or configurations that have not been tested and
are not supported by Microsoft.
<P>
If the steps or procedures described in this article do not function
properly, contact the manufacturer of the third-party product for more
information or use a supported configuration.

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Windows does not have the ability to spool local print jobs sent to the
printer by MS-DOS-based applications. This article contains a potential
workaround for this situation. This workaround may also alleviate device-
contention errors.
<P>
To spool print jobs from MS-DOS-based applications, you must print from
one computer to another using a dummy port and then redirect the job back
to the first computer. The print job is then put in the print queue. This
process may eliminate device conflicts when you try to print to the local
printer.
<P>
NOTE: This workaround works only if the application has the ability to
choose the LPT2 port instead of the LPT1 port.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following example shows how the print job is redirected over the
network. The diagram illustrates the flow of the data, and the text
explains how to configure your system to obtain this functionality.
