The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
This information applies to the Media Player and to Windows version 3.1.
<P>
If you play a disk and you have configured the Media Player for CDAudio by
choosing CDAudio from the Device menu, you may receive the following error
message
<P>
<PRE>   System Error - Cannot read from drive &lt;x&gt;

</PRE>where &lt;x&gt; is the drive letter of the CD-ROM. After selecting Cancel,
another error is displayed:
<P>
<PRE>   Cannot open file or device

</PRE><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
There are two possible workarounds for this problem:

<UL><LI>Open a different device from the Media Player Device menu (WaveAudio,
   MIDI Sequencer, or Animation). Open a file, and then choose CDAudio from
   the Device menu again.

<LI>Exit the Media Player and restart it. CDAudio will now function
   correctly.
<P>
</UL>This problem occurs when you attempt to open a file after changing CD-ROM
disks. The CD-ROM is still using the previous default directory, which is
now invalid because you have changed disks. When Windows tries to open the
CDAudio driver (MCICDA.DRV), it looks first in the current drive/directory,
which is now invalid. Because Windows does not allow the Ignore option to
be placed in the dialog box on a critical error, you cannot choose to
ignore the current drive error and continue looking along the rest of the
path for the driver.
