<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Windows version 3.1's Setup automatically replaces earlier
versions of HIMEM.SYS or HIMEM.EXE with the version supplied with
Windows 3.1, regardless of whether they were from Microsoft or another
company. Windows 3.1's HIMEM.SYS is version 3.07, and supports the
Lotus/Intel/Microsoft/AST eXtended Memory Specification version 3.0.
<P>
In general, HIMEM.SYS from Microsoft is completely compatible with the
HIMEM.EXE supplied by COMPAQ. Microsoft HIMEM.SYS version 3.07
includes all functionality found in COMPAQ HIMEM.EXE versions through
3.02 (which was the version available at the time Windows was
released).
<P>
However, COMPAQ will eventually ship a HIMEM.EXE version 3.03 which
will have one additional function not found in Microsoft HIMEM.SYS.
This is the ability to handle more than 16 MB of memory on an ISA
machine. (Existing versions of HIMEM.SYS will only support more than
16 MB of memory on EISA or MCA machines.) This feature will be turned
off by default and must be explicitly enabled to be used. If you need
this functionality, then you should continue to use the COMPAQ
HIMEM.EXE version 3.03.
<P>
The products included here are manufactured by vendors independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these
products' performance or reliability.
