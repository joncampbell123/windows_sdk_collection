The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
With Microsoft At Work PC Fax version 1.0 (supplied with Microsoft
Windows for Workgroups 3.11), if you want to perform binary file
transfers or use the advanced security features, you must use a Class
1 fax modem at both ends of the communication. This article provides
instructions to determine what class of fax modem you have.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Use the following procedure to determine what class of fax modem you
are using:

<OL><P><LI>Load the Terminal application provided with Windows for Workgroups
   and configure it with the correct settings for your modem.

<P><LI>In the Terminal window, type the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      AT+FCLASS=?
</PRE><P>
</OL>The modem should respond with one of the following strings of numbers:
<P>
<PRE>   0

   -or-

   0,1

   -or-

   0,1,2

   -or-

   0,2

</PRE></OL>These strings can be interpreted as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   0 = Data

   1 = Class 1

   2 = Class 2

</PRE>Class 1 and Class 2 are standards that define an interface with an
asynchronous serial bidirectional data stream between the computer and
the fax modem. Fax modems can be members of more than one fax class.
For example, if the result of the above procedure was "0,1,2," the fax
modem would belong to the Data, Class 1, and Class 2 categories.
<P>
Microsoft At Work PC Fax software can send a fax as a graphical image
(facsimile format) or as a Microsoft Mail message in binary form
(electronic mail format).
<P>
The ability to send a fax in binary form allows you to send
attachments, such as Word for Windows documents or Microsoft Excel
spreadsheets, to remote locations without having to use communications
software (such as Terminal). These attachments can also be edited,
whereas a fax transmitted in the facsimile format cannot be edited.
<P>
Without a Class 1 fax modem on both the sending and receiving ends of
a fax transmission made with At Work PC Fax, faxes always transfer as
graphical images that can be viewed and printed only.
<P>
At Work PC Fax also provides advanced security features to ensure the
security of faxes by encrypting them. An encrypted fax cannot be read
by anyone except the intended recipient. These security features
include password encryption, key encryption, and the ability to apply
a digital signature to the fax.
<P>
To use the security features provided by At Work PC Fax, both the
sender and the recipient of the fax must be using Microsoft At Work PC
Fax and Class 1 fax modems so that the fax can be transmitted in the
electronic mail binary file format.
