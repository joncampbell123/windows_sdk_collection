The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11
<LI>Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you upgrade from Microsoft Windows version 3.0 or 3.1 to Windows
for Workgroups or Windows version 3.11, you may receive one of the
following error messages:

<UL><LI>Windows 3.x could not be located on your computer. This version
   of Windows for Workgroups requires that Windows 3.x already be
   installed. You must either install Windows 3.x onto your
   computer, or purchase the complete version of Windows for
   Workgroups.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Windows 3.1 or Windows for Workgroups 3.1 could not be found on your
   system.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem can occur if:

<UL><LI>You do not have the appropriate version of Windows 3.0 or 3.1 installed
   on the computer for Windows or Windows for Workgroups to install
   properly.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>You are using an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) version of
   Windows 3.1 that was preinstalled and has the WIN.COM file renamed. For
   example, this problem occurs on some Toshiba laptops (because WIN.COM is
   renamed as WIN_.COM). This problem also occurs on some Acer Power 500
   computers (because WIN.COM is renamed as WINDOWS.COM).
<P>
   -or-

<LI>The [boot.description] section of the SYSTEM.INI file contains the line:
<P>
<P><PRE>      SETUPSTATE=1
</PRE><P>
   -or-

<LI>The SHELL= entry in the [boot] section of the SYSTEM.INI file refers to
   WINSETUP.EXE.
<P>
</UL><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 

<OL><P><LI>Install the appropriate version of Windows on your computer.

<P><LI>Use any text editor (such as Notepad) to edit the SYSTEM.INI file and
   delete the "SETUPSTATE=" line from the [boot.description] section of
   the file (if it is present).

<P><LI>Change the "SHELL=" line in the [boot] section of the SYSTEM.INI file
   from
<P>
<P><PRE>      shell=winsetup.exe
</PRE><P>
   to:
<P>
<P><PRE>      shell=progman.exe
</PRE>
<P><LI>Save and then close the file.

<P><LI>Install the upgrade or add-on again.
<P>
</OL>If you have an OEM version of Windows, you may need to use the following
steps:

<OL><P><LI>Rename WIN_.COM or WINDOWS.COM (in the Windows directory) to WIN.COM.

<P><LI>Run Setup.

<P><LI>Rename WIN.COM back to WIN_.COM or WINDOWS.COM.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The upgrade for Microsoft Windows version 3.0 and the add-on for Microsoft
Windows version 3.1 require that the appropriate version of Windows 3.0 or
3.1 be installed on the computer for Windows for Workgroups to install
properly. The upgrade and add-on Setup programs allow the Windows for
Workgroups files to be placed in the existing Windows directory or in a new
directory.
<P>
The upgrade for Microsoft Windows version 3.0 users installs a full version
of Windows for Workgroups on computers running Windows 3.0. The add-on for
Microsoft Windows version 3.1 installs a full version of Windows for
Workgroups on computers running Windows 3.1.
