<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you start Windows, you receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Could not read the file C:\TABWORKS\DEFAULT.TWF

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This error occurs when you are using TabWorks instead of Program Manager
as the Windows shell and there is a problem with the DEFAULT.TWF file.
The file may be missing or damaged, or it may have been moved to another
directory.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Use one of the following methods to work around this problem:
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1</h3>
 
<P>
Use Program Manager instead of TabWorks for the Windows shell. To do so,
quit Windows and edit the SYSTEM.INI file. Change the SHELL= line to
read:
<P>
<PRE>   shell=progman.exe

</PRE><h3>Method 2</h3>
 
<P>
Rebuild the default TabWorks book so that tabs and icons appear correctly.
To do so, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>From the TabWorks File menu, choose New Book. When you are prompted to
   save changes to untitled, choose No.

<P><LI>When you are prompted "Do you wish to create tabs from your existing
   Program Manager groups?" choose Yes. TabWorks creates a new default
   book.

<P><LI>If the fonts in the new book are legible, skip this step. If the fonts
   are not legible, change the tab font by choosing Options, then Font,
   then Tab Font.

<P><LI>Quit Windows. When you are prompted for a name for the new file, name
   it anything but DEFAULT.TWF (but make sure to give the file a .TWF
   extension). The name of the new file replaces the reference to
   DEFAULT.TWF in the [Binder] section of the TABWORKS.INI file.

<P><LI>Restart Windows.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
TabWorks is software published by Xerox and sold through Compaq that
replaces Program Manager as the Windows shell. A TabWorks book is a saved
file containing the information that formats and sorts groups (or "tabs")
and icons within the tabs. The DEFAULT.TWF file stores the information that
loads the default book when TabWorks starts. This file is located in the
TabWorks directory and is referenced in the TABWORKS.INI file.
<P>
A new version of TabWorks, version 1.1, is available from Compaq. The
new version automatically creates a backup DEFAULT.TWF file in case the
original one is damaged.
<P>
