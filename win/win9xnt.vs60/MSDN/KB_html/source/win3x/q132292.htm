The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
You can set At Work Fax to store unsent faxes in a queue for trans-mission
at a later time. At Work Fax can store a maximum of 75 faxes in the queue
at one time. If you exceed this number of stored faxes, you may receive one
of the following error messages:

<UL><LI>A general protection (GP) fault in FAXOPT.DLL.

<LI>An Undeliverable Mail message stating that the fax transport has run
   out of memory.
<P>
</UL>Or, the computer may stop responding (hang) or become unstable.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When At Work Fax places a fax in the queue, it renders the message and
prepares it for transmission by the fax modem, storing the message as a
file in the TEMP directory. Queued fax messages have a EFSND&lt;nn&gt;.EFX
filename, where &lt;nn&gt; is a number from 01 to 75.
<P>
FAXOPT.DLL is the At Work Fax module that is responsible for managing
the queue. This module takes EFSND&lt;nn&gt;.EFX files from the TEMP directory
and spools them to the modem. It also has an internal buffer for keeping
track of the number of fax messages and the priority of each message.
<P>
You may encounter the queue size limitation if you are using a shared
network fax that has send times set to Cheap Rates rather than ASAP, or
if you perform a mail merge to Electronic Fax in Microsoft Word for
Windows and the number of messages sent to the fax queue exceeds 75.
