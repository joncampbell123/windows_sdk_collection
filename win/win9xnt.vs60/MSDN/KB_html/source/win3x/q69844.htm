<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The "load=" and "run=" statements in the WIN.INI both load applications
when Windows boots up.
<P>
The "load=" statement loads applications as icons. None of these
applications are the active application.
<P>
The "run=" statement loads the applications in a window. The last
application loaded by the "run=" statement is the active application.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
load=
 
<P>
When loading an application from the "load=" statement in the WIN.INI file,
Windows uses the function SW_SHOWMINNOACTIVE. This function leaves the
application minimized (that is, an icon) as a background application.
<P>
In 386 enhanced mode, if an MS-DOS application is on the "load=" line and
the program information file (PIF) does not have the background option
selected, then the application does not actually load until you double-
click the icon, making the application active. With the background option
selected in the PIF, the application is then allowed to run in the
background and load into memory.
<P>
In standard and real modes, MS-DOS applications on the "load=" line have an
opportunity to load into memory before Windows continues on its next step.
This happens because Windows swaps itself out of memory to run MS-DOS
applications. The MS-DOS application becomes the active application during
this process and loads into memory. Then the system switches back to
Windows so Windows can continue with its next step.
<P>
run=
 
<P>
When loading an application from the "run=" statement in the WIN.INI file,
Windows uses the function SW_SHOWNORMAL. This function leaves the
application maximized (that is, in a full-screen window) as the active
application. If there is more than one application on the "run=" line, then
the last application is the active application when Windows is through
loading them.
