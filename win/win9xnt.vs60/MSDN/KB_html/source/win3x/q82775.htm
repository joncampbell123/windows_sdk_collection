<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Below is a list of files that are not compressed on the Windows 3.1
disk sets, and an explanation of why they are not compressed.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
DISKx: Where x corresponds to the disk number. These files are 8 bytes
in length. It would be useless to compress these files because they
would still take up a sector on each disk. These files are used during
System Administrator Setup (/A) to track which disks have been copied
to the network.
<P>
SETUP.EXE: This file cannot be compressed because it is started from
the source directory.
<P>
SETUP.INF: This file cannot be compressed because it is read from the
source directory during first time setup.
<P>
SETUP.SHH: This file is the template file for performing hands-off
installations (setup /H:setup.shh). Users must be able to read it from
the disk, make a local copy, and modify it to suit their hardware.
Although this file is intended to be used by System Administrators
(where it will be read from a network), Setup supports SETUP /H from a
disk.
<P>
SETUP.TXT: This file contains information about problems that may
occur while running Setup. It must be readable from the disk in the
unlikely event that Setup is unsuccessful.
<P>
XMSMMGR.EXE: This file is a TSR (terminate-and-stay-resident) version
of HIMEM.SYS. It is run from the source directory when Setup has
determined that there is not an XMS provider loaded in memory. Because
it is run from the source directory (which may be a disk), it must be
uncompressed.
<P>
EXPAND.EXE: This is the file expansion utility. It is used to manually
expand files from the Windows 3.1 disks. It cannot be in compressed
format.
<P>
SETUP.INI: This file is used during the implementation of Copy
Disincentive. In certain cases, when the customer enters his or her
name and company name, this information is written back to the disk
that contains SETUP.INI, in encrypted format. This file cannot be
compressed because it uses an encryption scheme, and is read directly
from the disk and never copied to disk.
<P>
MSD.EXE: This program is used to diagnose a user's H/W. In cases where
Setup fails, MSD (Microsoft Diagnostics) can be run directly from the
disk to determine the system configuration. Therefore, the file cannot
be compressed.
<P>
CONTROL.INF: This file contains a list of printers, which is used by
Control Panel to set up printers.
<P>
PRTDUPD.INF: This file is used by Setup to upgrade printers. It is
read into memory directly from the source directory (it is not copied
to disk except during System Administrator's Setup -- /A) during
printer upgrades, and therefore cannot be compressed.
