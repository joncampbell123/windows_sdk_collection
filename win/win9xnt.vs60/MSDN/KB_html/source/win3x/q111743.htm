1.0  Printing from MS-DOS based Applications
<P>
1.1 Print Conflicts Between Remote and Local MS-DOS based Applications
<P>
In Windows for Workgroups, Print Manager manages all local and remote
print jobs, except for those from local MS-DOS based applications. A
conflict arises if a remote client sends a print job at the same time
an MS-DOS based application is printing. Since Print Manager does not
control local MS-DOS generated print jobs and MS-DOS based programs
usually do not close printer ports when their print jobs are
complete, the redirector must use the MS-DOS based application's idle
time to determine when to print the remote print job. The time the
redirector waits is specified in the [Network] section of the
SYSTEM.INI file in the PRINTBUFTIME= statement. By default, this
value is set to 45 seconds.
<P>
If the above situation occurs, you are warned that a potential device
conflict exists and if you continue, the printed output may be
incorrect or garbled. The local (print server) print job goes
directly to the port, breaking up and potentially interrupting the
remote print job.
<P>
If you have a shared printer on your machine, do not override a
device conflict warning. You may be able to work around this problem
by setting PRINTBUFTIME= to a lower value (such as 10 seconds).
<P>
<P>
1.2 Spooling Print Jobs from MS-DOS based Applications
<P>
This section contains information on the use of Windows for
Workgroups with third-party products or configurations that have not
been tested and are not supported by Microsoft. If the procedures
described in this section do not enable print spooling to work
properly on your computer, contact the manufacturer of the
third-party product for more information or use a supported
configuration.
<P>
Windows for Workgroups cannot spool local print jobs sent to the
printer by MS-DOS based applications. The following paragraphs
outline a workaround for this situation. This workaround may also
alleviate device contention errors.
<P>
To spool print jobs from MS-DOS based applications, you must print
from one computer to another (using a dummy port) and then redirect
the job back to the first computer. The print job is then put in the
print queue. This may eliminate any device conflicts when you try to
print to the local printer.
<P>
Note: This works only if the application has the ability to choose
the LPT2 port over the LPT1 port.
<P>
In the following example, Computer One has a shared local printer on
LPT1 that is being accessed by Computer Two over the network.

<OL><P><LI> Install a printer driver for the port LPT1.DOS on Computer Two
</OL>and share it.

<OL><P><LI> From Computer One, connect to the share on Computer Two using LPT2.

<P><LI> Print from an MS-DOS based application to LPT2. Your print job
</OL>may be effectively spooled.
<P>
<P>
<P>
2.0  Printing Extended or International Characters
<P>
In addition to the 128 standard ASCII characters you can type by
using your keyboard, you can use extended or international characters
by using the Character Map application. For more information, see
Help for Character Map.
<P>
When Windows prints a file, each character you typed while using your
application is translated from the Windows character to the
appropriate character on your printer. If your printer supports the
same character, the character prints. Otherwise, some other
character, such as a period or other filler character, prints
instead. Check your printer manual and experiment with your printer
to determine which extended characters are supported.
<P>
Note: This limitation applies only to the printer's hardware fonts.
Fonts provided by Windows for Workgroups do print the extended
characters.
<P>
<P>
<P>
3.0  Configuring Your Printer's DIP-Switch Settings
<P>
The following printer models require certain DIP-switch settings in
order to work properly in Windows for Workgroups. Make sure you
configure your printer's DIP-switch settings before you install your
printer.
<P>
<P>
3.1  Canon Bubble-Jet BJ-10e and BJ-130e
<P>
All DIP switches should be set to the factory-default position. For
the BJ-10e and BJ-130e models, this is the OFF position.
<P>
<P>
3.2  Epson 9-Pin and 24-Pin Printers Supported by Windows for Workgroups
<P>
The following DIP-switch settings are required for all Epson 9-pin
and 24-pin printers:
<P>
Auto LineFeed: OFF
Skip Over Perf: OFF
<P>
<P>
3.3  Fujitsu 9-Pin and 24-Pin Printers Supported by Windows for Workgroups
<P>
The following DIP-switch settings are required for all Fujitsu 9-pin
and 24-pin printers:
<P>
Color:  AUTOSEL
LF Code:  LF Only
CR Code:  CR Only
Emulate:  DPL24/DPL24C
<P>
<P>
<P>
4.0  Notes About PostScript Printers and Cartridges
<P>
This section contains information specific to PostScript printers.
<P>
<P>
4.1  Installing a PostScript Printer
<P>
When you install a PostScript printer, make sure you select the name
of your printer model (not PostScript Printer) from the List Of
Printers box in the Printers dialog box. If you select PostScript
Printer, you may encounter problems when printing. However, if you
are using Finale (manufactured by CODA), this is not the case.
<P>
<P>
4.2  Installing Support for Additional PostScript Printers
<P>
If you are using a PostScript printer that is not listed in the List
Of Printers box in the Printers dialog box, you need to install a
Windows PostScript Definition (WPD) file for the printer. To do this,
use the Printers option in Control Panel or the Printer Setup command
in Print Manager, and select Install Unlisted Or Updated Printer in
the List Of Printers box.
<P>
Windows for Workgroups requires an OEMSETUP.INF file to install the
WPD file. Insert the vendor-provided disk that contains this file in
drive A, and then follow the instructions for setting up a printer.
For more information about installing a printer, see Help for Print
Manager.
<P>
4.3  Printing a PostScript Print File in UNIX
<P>
The PostScript printer driver inserts a CTRL+D key combination at the
beginning of every print job to reset the printer. Because UNIX
systems recognize CTRL+D as an end-of-file character, any print files
you create by using the PostScript printer driver do not print in
UNIX. You can correct this problem by removing the CTRL+D key
combination from the print job. To do this, add the following setting
to the [ModelName,Port] section in the WIN.INI file (where ModelName
is the name of your PostScript printer model):
<P>
CtrlD=0
<P>
For more information about editing the WIN.INI file, see the
WININI.WRI online document.
<P>
<P>
4.4  Printing TrueType Fonts in Place of Other Fonts on a PostScript
Printer
<P>
<P>
In most cases, the PostScript printer driver can evaluate the fonts
in your document and determine whether to use the Windows TrueType
fonts, the fonts built into your printer, or downloaded soft fonts.
<P>
In some cases, the printer driver can use either the Windows TrueType
fonts or the printer fonts, as in the following examples:
<P>
<PRE>  You are using a True Image printer that includes built-in TrueType
</PRE></OL>fonts that have the same name as the Windows TrueType fonts, such as
Times New Roman.
<P>
<PRE>  You want to print a document in Windows for Workgroups version 3.11
</PRE>that was created by using Windows version 3.0, and the document
contains a font that is no longer supported, such as Tms Rmn. In this
case, the closest matching printer font is Times, and the closest
matching Windows font is Times New Roman; both are acceptable for
printing.
<P>
If the driver can use either the Windows TrueType fonts or the
printer fonts, it uses the printer fonts by default. If you want the
driver to use the Windows TrueType fonts instead, add the following
setting to the [ModelName,Port] section in the WIN.INI file (where
ModelName is the name of your PostScript printer model):
<P>
ttfavor=1
<P>
To use the printer fonts again, set this value to 0.
<P>
For more information about editing the WIN.INI file, see the
WININI.WRI online document.
<P>
<P>
4.5  Controlling TrueType Font Downloading on PostScript Printers
<P>
When you are setting printer options for a PostScript printer, you
can specify that TrueType fonts be downloaded as Adobe Type 1 fonts.
To do this, use the Send To Printer As option in the Advanced Options
dialog box for the PostScript printer driver. This setting causes
smaller TrueType fonts to be printed as bitmaps and larger TrueType
fonts to be printed as outline fonts.
<P>
By using the MinOutlineEppem setting in the WIN.INI file, you can
specify (in the number of points per em) exactly when TrueType fonts
should be printed as bitmaps and when they should be printed as
outline fonts. To do this, add the following setting to the
[ModelName,Port] section in the WIN.INI file (where ModelName is the
name of your PostScript printer model):
<P>
minoutlineeppem=&lt;number&gt;
<P>
The default value for number of points per em is 101. Fonts whose
points per em are fewer than the number you specify are downloaded as
bitmaps. Fonts whose points per em are greater are downloaded as
outline fonts. To conserve printer memory, decrease the value. To
produce high-quality printed fonts at larger point sizes, increase
the value. Increasing the value also speeds up printing time but
requires more memory.
<P>
For more information about editing the WIN.INI file, see the
WININI.WRI online document.
<P>
<P>
4.6  Setting the Timeout for PostScript Printers
<P>
Some PostScript printers require a high timeout value in order to
print complex documents. If you selected the Print PostScript Error
Information check box in the Advanced Options dialog box when you
configured your printer and your printer is printing timeout
messages, try increasing the printer's timeout value. To specify the
timeout value for your printer, add the following setting to the
[ModelName,Port] section in the WIN.INI file (where ModelName is the
name of your PostScript printer model):
<P>
timeout=&lt;number-of-seconds&gt;
<P>
For example, if you want to set the printer timeout to 10 minutes on
an Apple LaserWriter IINT connected to LPT1, you would add the
following setting to the [Apple LaserWriter IINT,LPT1] section of the
WIN.INI file:
<P>
timeout=600
<P>
Note: The timeout setting and the Timeouts options in the Printer
Connect dialog box are unrelated. The timeout setting specifies the
timeout value for your printer, whereas the Timeouts options in the
Printer Connect dialog box specify the timeouts for Windows.
<P>
For more information about configuring your printer and setting
Timeouts options for Windows, see Help for Print Manager or Control
Panel. For more information about editing the WIN.INI file, see the
WININI.WRI online document.
<P>
<P>
4.7  Rotating EPS Files When Printing in Landscape Mode
<P>
If the placement or orientation of imported images (such as EPS
files) is incorrect when you are printing in landscape mode from an
application that supports imported files, try adding the following
setting to the [ModelName,Port] section of the WIN.INI file (where
ModelName is the name of your PostScript printer model):
<P>
LandScapeOrient=270
<P>
For more information about editing the WIN.INI file, see the
WININI.WRI online document.
