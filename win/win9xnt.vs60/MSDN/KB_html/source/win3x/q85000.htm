The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.1, 3.11
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Works for Windows, version 2.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Some fonts, including the WingDings font, included with Windows version 3.1
do not correctly export from Character Map, CHARMAP.EXE, into some Windows-
based applications, such as Write and version 4.0 of Microsoft Excel for
Windows.
<P>
NOTE: This problem does not occur with the Times New Roman or Arial fonts.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When using the Character Map to insert a character into a Windows
application, you are copying the character to the clipboard. The font
chosen in the Character Map must be the same font as selected in the
application. If  Wingdings is selected in the Character Map then the
Wingdings font must be selected in the application.
<P>
If, for example, you copy the WingDings ampersand character (keystroke k)
from Character Map, and paste it into Excel where you have the Microsoft
Sans Serif font selected, the Sans Serif k character (keystroke k) is
pasted in rather than the Wingdings ampersand.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Open the Clipboard, or open the Clipbook Viewer.

<P><LI>Select the View menu.

<P><LI>Notice that Default Format is checked and Rich Text Format is greyed
   out(not available).

<P><LI>Choose Text.

<P><LI>Close the Clipboard or Clipbook Viewer.

<P><LI>Open Character Map and copy the same Wingdings symbol.

<P><LI>Open the Clipboard.

<P><LI>Notice that the symbol displays correctly.

<P><LI>Click on the View menu and notice that Default Format is checked again
   and now Rich Text Format is available.
<P>
</OL>Copying a Wingdings symbol while the Text option was selected, forced the
clipboard to add Rich Text format as an available option thus, translating
the correct symbol.
<P>
To insert a WingDings character in a file, proceed as follows:

<OL><P><LI>In your application, locate the position where you want the
   WingDing character to be located and choose WingDings as your font.

<P><LI>Select the WingDing character from Character Map, and paste it into
   your application.
<P>
</OL>If you have already pasted the character into your document and it
appears in the incorrect font, you can convert it to WingDings as
follows:

<OL><P><LI>Select the text that was supposed to be WingDings.

<P><LI>Use the font menu in your application to convert the text back to
   WingDings.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: You can insert the Wingding font multiple times by typing the font
and then choosing Copy from the Edit menu. You can then paste the font
whenever you want regardless of the chosen font.
