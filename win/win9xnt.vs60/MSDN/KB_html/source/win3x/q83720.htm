<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article discusses the installation and use of Microsoft Windows
3.1 on an AT&amp;T Safari notebook computer.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Installing Windows 3.1 on a AT&amp;T Safari</h3>
 
<P>
Windows 3.1 cannot be installed in a new directory on an AT&amp;T Safari
notebook computer. Windows must be upgraded by installing Windows 3.1
over Windows 3.0. If you attempt to install Windows in a new
subdirectory or have renamed the WIN.COM file, you receive the
following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Windows cannot be installed on this type of computer. You can only
   upgrade from version 3.0

   Quit Setup, contact your hardware manufacturer for a copy of
   Windows 3.0 and install it on your system. Then run Setup for
   Windows 3.1 to update.

</PRE>AT&amp;T has a version of Windows 3.0 that was modified specifically for
the Safari notebook computers. The devices included with this version
of Windows are also required to run Windows 3.1.
<P>
<P><h3>Problems Running MS-DOS Prompt</h3>
 
<P>
According to AT&amp;T technical support, when you run an MS-DOS prompt
from Windows 3.1 in 386 enhanced mode, the computer may hang when you
attempt to access a floppy drive. This problem may also occur in
MS-DOS when you are not running Windows.
<P>
The problem can be corrected with a BIOS upgrade. You can identify the
problem BIOS by the "Diagnostics Reference ID ##" line that is
displayed at the top of the screen when you first start up your
machine. The problem BIOS is number 12.
<P>
To upgrade the BIOS, you must send your machine to AT&amp;T to have the
chip set replaced. At this time, the most recent version of the BIOS
is 16. For more information, please contact AT&amp;T.
<P>
Safari notebook computers are manufactured by AT&amp;T, a vendor
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise,
regarding this product's performance or reliability.
