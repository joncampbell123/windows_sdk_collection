The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.1, 3.11
<LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
This article contains information about using Windows and Windows for
Workgroups with third-party products or configurations that have not been
tested and are not supported by Microsoft.
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you try to run an application, you receive an error message similar to
one of the following

<UL><LI>&lt;Product Name&gt; requires VSHARE.386 to be installed.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>&lt;Product Name&gt; requires SHARE.EXE in order to run.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>You must exit Windows and load SHARE.EXE in order to run &lt;Product Name&gt;
<P>
   where &lt;Product Name&gt; is the application you are running.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Many Windows-based applications that support OLE 2.0 require file-sharing
and file-locking capabilities to be enabled. This is accomplished by
loading VSHARE.386 in the [386Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file or by
loading SHARE.EXE in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file.
<P>
If you use Novell DOS, VSHARE.386 does not function properly, and file-
sharing and file-locking capabilities are not properly enabled.
<P>
The following applications are known to encounter such errors when
SHARE.EXE or VSHARE.386 is not present:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access version 2.0
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, version 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Project for Windows, version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Publisher version 2.0
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, version 6.0
<LI>Microsoft Works for Windows, version 3.0
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
There are two possible resolutions to these error messages:

<UL><LI>Install and use a supported version of Microsoft MS-DOS rather than
   Novell DOS.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Use the DOS level terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) program SHARE.EXE
   provided by Novell DOS instead of VSHARE.386. To do this:
<P>
   1. Open the SYSTEM.INI file with a text editor, such as Windows Notepad.
<P>
   2. Place a semicolon in front of the VSHARE.386 setting in the [386Enh]
<P><PRE>      section as follows:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>         [386Enh]
         ;Device=VSHARE.386

   3. Open the AUTOEXEC.BAT file with the text editor.

   4. Add the line for SHARE.EXE to this file.

      NOTE: For specific instructions about the settings that can be
      used with SHARE.EXE, consult your Novell DOS manual.

   5. Quit Windows and reboot your computer.

</PRE></UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Windows 3.11 and Windows for Workgroups 3.1 and 3.11 ship with
VSHARE.386. VSHARE.386 is available from Microsoft PSS as a separate
Application Note (WW1000) for Windows 3.1. Some applications (such as
Microsoft Word 6.0 for Windows) ship and install VSHARE.386 on systems not
already equipped with it.
<P>
VSHARE.386 is a virtual device driver (VxD) and does not use conventional
memory. Microsoft recommends that you use this VxD rather than SHARE.EXE.
