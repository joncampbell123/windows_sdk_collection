The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Some earlier CD-ROM drives may not be able to play audio CDs. The MCI
CD Audio device driver released with Windows will install regardless
of the CD drive's ability to play CD audio.
<P>
The manufacturer of the CD drive should be contacted for an updated
device driver or CD drive.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The MCI CD Audio device driver will install in the Driver dialog box
of Control Panel. No errors will be received, until an attempt is made
to play the audio CD. Media Player, for example, might display this
error message:
<P>
<PRE>   No MCI drivers present.

</PRE>Looking back at the installed drivers list in Control Panel will show
that the MCI CD Audio driver is properly installed. You can choose the
Setup button and a message will appear:
<P>
<PRE>   One CDROM drive was detected. Installation is complete.

</PRE>At this point, you should check that you have the current, supported
versions of MSCDEX.EXE (Microsoft CD Extensions) and CD drive software
with the manufacturer of the CD drive.
