</OL> 
If you have questions about procedures or commands mentioned in this
file, you will probably find answers in the Microsoft "MS-DOS User's
Guide and Reference." The following paragraphs describe frequently
mentioned topics that the guide covers in more detail.
<P>
Many sections of the readme discuss changing your CONFIG.SYS file. For
detailed information about modifying a CONFIG.SYS file, see Chapter 11
of the "MS-DOS User's Guide and Reference."
<P>
The readme often refers to DEVICE commands in your CONFIG.SYS file.
These DEVICE= statements are meant to be examples of the type of
command you might need to add to your CONFIG.SYS file. You need to
modify these statements to reflect the configuration of your system.
For more information, see the DEVICE command in Chapter 14 of the
"MS-DOS User's Guide and Reference."
<P>
The readme sometimes asks you to use the EXPAND command to copy files
from the distribution disks to your hard disk. See Chapter 14 of the
"MS-DOS User's Guide and Reference" for more information about using
the EXPAND command.

<OL><P><LI>NOTES ON SETUP
</OL> 
For information about the Windows portion of Setup and Setup conflicts
with terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) programs, see the SETUP.TXT
file.  For the location of the file, see the PACKING.LST file on Setup
disk 1.
<P>
<P><h3>2.1 Priam and Everex Disk-Partitioning Software</h3>
 
For information about Priam and Everex, see the section "Setup
displays the 'Incompatible hard disk or device driver' screen" in
Chapter 3 of "Getting Started."
<P>
<P><h3>2.2 SyQuest Removable Hard Disk</h3>
 
For information about SyQuest, see the section "Setup displays the
<PRE>'Incompatible hard disk or device driver' screen" in Chapter 3 of
</PRE></OL>"Getting Started."
<P>
<P><h3>2.3 Iomega Bernoulli Products</h3>
 
Bernoulli Cache
<P>
For information about Bernoulli Cache, see the section "Setup displays
the 'Incompatible hard disk or device driver' screen" in Chapter 3 of
"Getting Started."
<P>
Note: The most recent Iomega products may include Future Systems
<PRE>      Solutions' SpeedCache+, which is usually loaded with a command
      in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file. If you use SpeedCache+, open your
      AUTOEXEC.BAT file with any text editor, type "rem" and a space
      in front of the command that loads the SCPLUS.EXE file, and save
      the file, and restart your computer by pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL.
      For example, the modified command line should look like this:

      REM SCPLUS INSTALL

      After you have installed Windows and MS-DOS, remove the "rem"
      from the command line, save the file, and restart your computer.

</PRE>Fixed Drive and Bernoulli Removable Drive
<P>
If your computer has a fixed disk drive, the fixed disk drive should
be used to boot your computer. The ROM on the Iomega PC2B or PC4B
adapter should be disabled. Refer to the Host Adapter Installation
guide for more information.
<P>
Bernoulli OAD and RCD Drivers
<P>
All versions of Iomega OAD drivers are compatible with MS-DOS 5.0.
The OAD drivers began shipping in May 1992
<P>
If you are using an Iomega RCD driver, such as RCD.SYS or RCD4.SYS,
you need at least version 4.7 for a PC2 adapter or version 6.2 for
a PC4 adapter. If you have an Iomega PC0 adapter (A10-20.COM) or a
PC3B adapter (RCD3.SYS), you will need a new adapter card. Contact
Iomega Customer Service for more information.
<P>
If you have problems installing Windows and MS-DOS 5.0 on a bootable
Bernoulli drive, and you are using the new Iomega OAD driver, disable
the driver in the CONFIG.SYS file before running Setup. To disable the
driver, open your CONFIG.SYS file with any text editor and type "rem"
and a space in front of the command that loads the driver. The command
line should look something like this:
<P>
REM DEVICE=C:\OADDOS\DOSOAD.SYS
<P>
Save the file and restart your computer by pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL. Then
Run Setup again. If you cannot set up Windows and MS-DOS, contact
Iomega Customer Service for more information.
<P>
If you are able to set up Windows and MS-DOS, remove the "rem" from
the command line that loads the OAD driver, save the file, and
restart your computer.
<P>
<P><h3>2.4 Disk Manager</h3>
 
For information about Disk Manager, see the section "Setup displays
the 'Incompatible hard disk or device driver' screen" in Chapter 3 of
"Getting Started."
<P>
<P><h3>2.5 SpeedStor and Volume Expansion</h3>
 
If you have a SpeedStor partition on your computer, Setup probably
referred you to this section for one of the following reasons:
<P>
* Setup could not find in your CONFIG.SYS file a command
<PRE>  for the device driver that supports your SpeedStor partition.
  If this is the case, add the command line to your CONFIG.SYS
  file, restart your computer, and run Setup. For more information
  about adding the command line to your CONFIG.SYS file, see your
  SpeedStor documentation.

</PRE>* Your CONFIG.SYS file has a DEVICE=HARDRIVE.SYS line in it.
<PRE>  If this is the case, carry out the following procedure:
   1. Use the EXPAND command to expand and copy the SSTOR.SYS
      file to your hard disk. Make sure you copy the SSTOR.SYS
      file to the same path as the HARDRIVE.SYS file.

      See the PACKING.LST file on Setup disk 1 for the location
      of the SSTOR.SYS file on the Setup disks and for instructions
      on how to expand and copy it to your hard drive.

   2. Replace the DEVICE=HARDRIVE.SYS file with a DEVICE=SSTOR.SYS
      command. For example, if the command that loaded the
      HARDRIVE.SYS file was "DEVICE=C:\SSTOR\HARDRIVE.SYS", you
      would replace it with the following:

      DEVICE=C:\SSTOR\SSTOR.SYS

   3. Restart your computer by pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL.

   4. To make sure you can access your hard drive, type the following
      at the command prompt:

      dir

   5. Insert Setup disk 1 in drive A, and type the following at the
      command prompt:

      a:setup

</PRE>If you have a Novell or Xenix partition, see the section "Setup
displays the 'Incompatible hard disk or device driver' screen" in
Chapter 3 of "Getting Started."
<P>
If your system is an IBM PS/2 or has MicroChannel architecture,
contact your software vendor for disk-partitioning software that is
compatible with MS-DOS 5.0.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>2.6 Novell Partitions</h3>
 
For information about Novell Partitions, see the section "Setup
displays the 'Incompatible hard disk or device driver' screen" in
Chapter 3 of "Getting Started."
<P>
<P><h3>2.7 Vfeature Deluxe</h3>
 
For information about Vfeature Deluxe, see the section "Setup displays
the 'Incompatible hard disk or device driver' screen" in Chapter 3 of
"Getting Started."
<P>
<P><h3>2.8 Columbia Data Products Device Driver</h3>
 
If you use a Columbia Data Products device driver, carry out the
following procedure:
<P>
<PRE>   1. Remove the DEVICE=SSTBIOS.SYS and DEVICE=SSTDRIVE.SYS commands
      from your CONFIG.SYS file before running Setup.
   2. Restart your system.
   3. Run Setup.
   4. Reinstall the device drivers by returning the DEVICE=
      commands to your CONFIG.SYS file and restarting your system.

</PRE><h3>2.9 Incompatible Primary DOS Partition</h3>
 
If Setup referred you to this section, and no other section in part 2
of this README.TXT file is relevant to your system, you have a
partition that is incompatible with MS-DOS 5.0. You must delete the
partition from your hard disk. See the section "Setup detects a
problem with your primary DOS partition" in Chapter 3 of "Getting
Started." Make sure you back up the files on your hard drive before
deleting your partition.
<P>
<P><h3>2.10 WYSE Partition</h3>
 
If you have partitions created by WYSE DOS 2.11 or 3.1, you must
delete them from your hard disk before running Setup. See the section
"Setup detects a problem with your primary DOS partition" in Chapter 3
of "Getting Started." Make sure you back up the files on your hard
drive before deleting your partition.
<P>
<P><h3>2.11 286 Accelerator Card</h3>
 
If your system includes a 286 accelerator card, Setup may not be able
to determine the amount of extended memory you have and may
incorrectly install MS-DOS 5.0. If this occurs, disable the card
before running Setup. If you can't disable the card, install MS-DOS
5.0 manually. Use the procedure in the "Priam and Everex" section of
"Setup displays the 'Incompatible hard disk or device driver' screen"
in Chapter 3 of "Getting Started."
<P>
<P><h3>2.12 Iomega Bernoulli Products</h3>
 
If Setup refers you to this section, see section 2.3 of this file.
<P>
<P><h3>2.13 AT&amp;T 6300 Computer</h3>
 
If you use an AT&amp;T 6300 computer and your ROM BIOS is version 1.20 or
earlier, contact your vendor for a ROM BIOS upgrade. The ROM BIOS
version number is displayed when you start your computer.
<P>
<P><h3>2.14 Western Digital SCSI Hard-Disk Controller</h3>
 
If you are using a Western Digital WD 7000 FASST or AT/XT SCSI
controller with hard-disk ROM version 3.35 or earlier, contact
Columbia Data Products Customer Services for an upgrade before
installing Windows and MS-DOS 5.0. The ROM version number is displayed
when you start your computer.
<P>
<P><h3>2.15 Machine-Specific HIMEM.SYS Switches</h3>
 
For HIMEM.SYS /machine switch values, see "You receive the 'Missing
HIMEM.SYS' message" in Chapter 4 of "Getting Started," and page 545 of
the "User's Guide" for Microsoft Windows version 3.1.
<P>
<P><h3>2.16 Toshiba with a Hard RAM Disk</h3>
 
These instructions apply to Toshiba models T1200, T1600, T1200XE and
T1000LE.
<P>
To use the hard RAM disk, do the following before installing MS-DOS
5.0:
<PRE>  1. Back up your hard RAM disk.
  2. Using the Toshiba Setup program, delete the hard RAM
     disk by allocating zero kilobytes to it. All data on
     the hard RAM disk will be lost.
  3. Restart your system.
  4. Install Windows and MS-DOS.
  5. Use the Toshiba Setup program to reinstall the hard RAM
     disk.
  6. Run FDISK, change to drive 2, and create a primary DOS
     partition. Quit FDISK.
  7. Use the FORMAT command to format drive D.

</PRE><h3>2.17 Unix And Xenix Partitions</h3>
 
If you have a Novell or Xenix partition, see the section "Setup
displays the 'Incompatible hard disk or device driver' screen" in
Chapter 3 of "Getting Started."
<P>
<P><h3>2.18 Apricot XEN-S Computer</h3>
 
To install Windows and MS-DOS on an Apricot XEN-S computer:
<PRE>   1. Remove the DEVICE=AEMM386.SYS command from your CONFIG.SYS file.
   2. Restart your system.
   3. Run Setup.
   4. Put the DEVICE=AEMM386.SYS command back in your CONFIG.SYS file
      and restart your system.

</PRE><h3>2.19 4DOS</h3>
 
Setup replaces the SHELL command in your CONFIG.SYS file with one that
invokes COMMAND.COM. To recover your 4DOS SHELL command, retrieve it
from the original CONFIG.SYS file, which is saved as CONFIG.DAT on
your Uninstall disk.
<P>
If external DOS utilities display messages that refer to error
numbers, contact JP Software for an upgrade.
<P>
2.20 LapLink
 
If you use Traveling Software LapLink, disable the LapLink device
driver before you install Windows and MS-DOS. The driver conflicts
with the Setup program. Once you install Windows and MS-DOS, reenable
the LapLink driver.
<P>
<P><h3>2.21 Stacker</h3>
 
<P>
If you are using Stacker data-compression software on your computer,
begin by determining which drives are compressed and which are
uncompressed.
<P>
To determine which drives are compressed and which are uncompressed
<P>
*   Type the following at the command prompt:
<P>
<PRE>    [drive]:\stacker\swapmap

    For the [drive] parameter, type the letter of the drive
    that contains your Stacker directory.

    If drive C was drive C at boot time, carry out Procedure 1.

    Otherwise, the drive that was C at boot time is the uncompressed
    drive. The drive that is now C is compressed. Carry out Procedure
    2.

</PRE>Procedure 1
<P>
To set up Windows and MS-DOS
<P>
1   Type the following at the command prompt:
<P>
<PRE>    a:setup

</PRE>2   When the "A disk-compression program is in use" screen
<PRE>    appears, choose Continue Setup.

</PRE>3   Follow the instructions on your screen.
<P>
Procedure 2
<P>
You need to determine whether there is enough disk space on your
uncompressed drive to set up MS-DOS 5.0
<P>
To determine whether there is enough disk space
<P>
*   Type the following at the command prompt:
<P>
<PRE>    chkdsk [drive]:

    For the [drive] parameter, type the letter of the
    uncompressed drive.

    Information about your hard disk appears. If the bytes
    available on disk are more than 3,000,000, carry out
    Procedure 1. Otherwise, carry out Procedure 3.

</PRE>Procedure 3
<P>
To set up Windows and MS-DOS on a computer that has Stacker installed:
<P>
1   Quit Setup if you have not already done so.
<P>
2   Set up MS-DOS on floppy disks by typing the
<PRE>    following at the command prompt:

    a:setup /f

    Follow the instructions on your screen.

    NOTE
    If your Setup disks are a higher density than your drive A, see
    section 2.27 of the README.TXT file to set up MS-DOS on floppy
    disks.

</PRE>3   Restart your computer from the hard disk by removing disks
<PRE>    from all floppy disk drives, and restarting your computer by
    pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL.

</PRE>4   To determine the path of COMMAND.COM file, type the following
<PRE>    at the command prompt:

    set

    A list of environment variables appears on your screen.

    The line that begins with COMPSPEC= indicates the location of the
    COMMAND.COM file. For example, the following indicates that the
    COMMAND.COM file is in the DOS directory:

    COMSPEC=C:\DOS\COMMAND.COM

</PRE>5   Type the following at the command prompt:
<P>
<PRE>    c:\stacker\swapmap

    The drive that was C at boot time is the uncompressed drive. The
    drive that is now C is the compressed drive.

</PRE>6   Create an OLDDOS directory by typing the following at the command
<PRE>    prompt:

    md c:\olddos

</PRE>7   Copy your old DOS files to the OLDDOS directory. For example, if
<PRE>    your files are in C:\DOS, type the following at the command
    prompt:

    copy c:\dos\*.* c:\olddos

</PRE>8   Delete your original DOS files from your DOS directory. For
<PRE>    example, if your original files are in the DOS directory on
    drive C, type the following at the command prompt:

    del c:\dos\*.*

</PRE>9   Copy all files from the Startup/Support disk to the directory that
<PRE>    contained your original DOS files.

    For example, if the Startup/Support disk is in drive A, and you
    want to copy the files to the DOS directory on drive C, type the
    following:

    copy a:*.* c:\dos

</PRE>10  If the COMSPEC variable indicates that the COMMAND.COM file is in
<PRE>    a directory other than the one your original DOS files were in,
    copy the COMMAND.COM file to the directory the COMSPEC variable
    specifies.

</PRE>11  Copy the COMMAND.COM file to the DOS directory on the uncompressed
<PRE>    drive. (Refer to Step 5 to determine which drive uncompressed.)
    For example, if the Startup/ Support disk is in drive A and the
    DOS directory is on the uncompressed drive E, type the following
    at the command prompt:

    copy a:command.com e:\dos

</PRE>12  Insert the Help/BASIC/Edit/Utility disk in drive A, and copy all
<PRE>    the files from it to your DOS directory on drive C. Then insert
    the Supplemental disk in drive A, and copy all the files from it
    to your DOS directory on drive C.

</PRE>13  On the uncompressed drive, update any drivers in your CONFIG.SYS
<PRE>    file that load before the STACKER.COM file.

    Typically, these files are located in the DOS directory on the
    uncompressed drive. For example, if the DOS directory contains the
    SETVER.EXE, EMM386.EXE, and HIMEM.SYS files, copy these files
    From your floppy disks to the DOS directory on the uncompressed
    drive. To determine the location of the device driver files on the
    Startup/Support, Help/BASIC/Edit/Utility, and Supplemental disks,
    open the PACKING.LST file on Setup Disk 1 by using any text
    editor.

    If a driver you need is not located on one of these disks, expand
    and copy the driver from the Setup disks. To determine the
    location of the driver you need, open the PACKING.LST file on
    Setup Disk 1 by using any text editor. The PACKING.LST file also
    contains instructions on how to expand the compressed files on the
    Setup disks.

    Note: Do not update the SMARTDRV.EXE or SMARTDRV.SYS files. Setup
    will update these file for you.

</PRE>14  Copy the CHKDSK.EXE file from the DOS directory on drive C to the
<PRE>    DOS directory on your uncompressed drive.

</PRE>15  Insert the Startup/Support disk in drive A, and restart your
<PRE>    computer by pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL. Then type the following at the
    command prompt:

    sys a: c:

</PRE>16  Remove disks from all floppy disk drives, and restart your
<PRE>    computer by pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL. If Stacker prompts you to
    update the COMMAND.COM file, choose Yes.

</PRE>17  To make sure you can access your hard disk, type the following at
<PRE>    the command prompt:

    c:
    dir

</PRE>18  Insert the Startup/Support disk in drive A, and type the following
<PRE>    at the command prompt:

    a:
    sys a: c:

</PRE>19  Repeat step 16.
<P>
20  Before setting up Windows, read the following information.
<P>
If you are using Stacker to compress your hard disk, there are
certain steps you need to take before setting up Windows.
<P>
*  If you have not set up MS-DOS 5.0, and you want to set up
<PRE>   Windows only on a computer with an older version of Stacker,
   your computer might halt on Setup disk 3 while it is analyzing
   your system software. If this happens, remove the Setup disk,
   restart your computer by pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL, and run
   Setup again by typing the following at the command prompt:

   a:setup /w /c

   Note: Before you run Setup again, make sure all the commands
         that load memory-resident programs have been disabled
         in your AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS files. To disable
         a command, type "rem" and a space in front of the command
         in your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT file. Then save the
         file, and restart your computer.

</PRE>*  If you want to use a swap file with Windows, you must
<PRE>   set up the swap file on the uncompressed drive. When
   setting up Stacker, you can leave at least 1 megabyte (MB)
   of disk space uncompressed for storing system files. To
   leave enough space for the swap file, it is recommended
   that you allocate as uncompressed disk space twice the
   amount of your system memory. For example, if your
   system has 4 MB of memory, you should leave at least 8 MB
   of disk space uncompressed. For more information about
   swap files, see "Working with Windows Swap Files" in Chapter 14,
   "Optimizing Windows," in the "Microsoft Windows User's Guide."

   If Stacker is already set up on your computer and there is not
   enough uncompressed disk space for a swap file, you can run
   the STAC utility provided with Stacker to increase the amount
   of uncompressed disk space. For more information, see your
   Stacker documentation.

</PRE>*  If you upgraded from an earlier version of Stacker to
<PRE>   Stacker 2.0 or later, choose the Custom Setup option
   when you run Setup. When Setup prompts you, don't choose to let
   Setup modify your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files. Modify
   these files yourself after Setup is complete by carrying out
   the following steps:

   * In your AUTOEXEC.BAT, add Windows to your path.

   * Copy the HIMEM.SYS and EMM386.EXE files to your
     uncompressed drive, unless you use a different memory
     manager, such as QEMM-386.

   * Add DEVICE commands for HIMEM.SYS and EMM386.EXE to
     your CONFIG.SYS file, unless you use a different memory
     manager such as QEMM-386. The command lines that load these
     drivers should appear before the command that loads
     STACKER.COM.

   * Make sure a copy of SMARTDRV.EXE is on the
     uncompressed drive. In your CONFIG.SYS file, the
     SMARTDRV.EXE command line should include the
     "/double_buffer" switch and should be the path
     of the file at boot time. For example, if SMARTDRV.EXE
     is in the root directory at boot time, you would include
     the following command in your CONFIG.SYS:

     DEVICE=C:\SMARTDRV.EXE /DOUBLE_BUFFER

     SMARTDRV.EXE should be loaded before STACKER.COM in the
     CONFIG.SYS file.

   * In the AUTOEXEC.BAT file, the SMARTDRV.EXE command
     line should be the path of the file after disk drives
     are swapped. Also, add the /L switch to the SMARTDRV.EXE
     command in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

</PRE>*  If you are using Stacker version 2.0 or later, but didn't
<PRE>   upgrade from Stacker version 1.1, choose the Express Setup
   option when you are prompted. Setup will modify your CONFIG.SYS
   and AUTOEXEC.BAT files for you. When Setup is finished making
   the modifications, it displays a message at the end
   of the Windows portion of Setup that notifies you of the
   modifications that have been made. If you have used Stacker to
   swap your startup drive, when you restart your system Stacker will
   ask whether you want to update to the new version of the
   CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT file. Choose Yes.

</PRE>*  If you are using a version of Stacker earlier than 2.0, you
<PRE>   need to modify your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files
   yourself, using the CONFIG.WIN and AUTOEXEC.WIN files that
   Setup generates. For information about using these files,
   see "Modifying Your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT Files Yourself,"
   following this topic.

</PRE>*  After you have set up MS-DOS manually, type the following at
<PRE>   the command prompt to set up Windows:

   a:setup /w

   Note: After you have set up Windows and know your system is
         working correctly, you might want to delete the DOS files
         in your OLDDOS directory.


</PRE><h3>Modifying Your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT Files Yourself</h3>
 
<P>
If Setup cannot modify your startup files, Setup writes proposed
changes to the CONFIG.WIN and AUTOEXEC.WIN files. (These files may
also be named CONFIG.00x and AUTOEXEC.00x if CONFIG.WIN and
AUTOEXEC.WIN already exist.) In this case, you must either move
the HIMEM.SYS, SMARTDRV.EXE, and EMM386.EXE files to a drive
that is available when you start your computer, or use a
text editor to modify your CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT file
so that any references to HIMEM.SYS, SMARTDRV.EXE, and
EMM386.EXE appear after the DEVICE command that loads
the drivers for your disk drives. Refer to the CONFIG.WIN
and AUTOEXEC.WIN files for the proposed changes.
<P>
Note: You have the choice of using HIMEM.SYS and EMM386.EXE
<PRE>      as your memory managers, or of using a third-party
      memory manager, such as QEMM-386. If you decide to
      use a third-party memory manager, do not copy HIMEM.SYS
      or EMM386.EXE to a drive that is available when you
      start your computer, and do not add commands for these
      files to your AUTOEXEC.BAT or CONFIG.SYS file. These files
      should already include the correct command lines for your
      memory manager.

      If you decide to use HIMEM.SYS and EMM386.EXE instead
      of the third-party memory manager, delete the commands
      that load the third-party memory manager in your
      CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT file. Then add command lines
      for HIMEM.SYS and EMM386.EXE in your CONFIG.SYS or
      AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

</PRE><h3>2.22 Dell DOS 3.30</h3>
 
Some Dell DOS 3.30 installations were done with a utility called
AFORMAT, which creates and formats multiple 32 MB partitions. These
extended partitions become invisible with Windows and MS-DOS unless
you run a utility called FIXPART before or after installing Windows

remove all existing SMARTDRV.EXE switches, you will need to manually
restore any switches which Setup removes.

<OL><P><LI>NOTES ON MEMORY MANAGEMENT
</OL> 
<P>
<P><h3>3.1 386MAX (5.11 or Earlier)</h3>
 
If you have used the SETVER command to report a different version
number to a program you are loading into the upper memory area with
386LOAD.COM or MAXHI.COM, also use the SETVER command to report that
number to 386LOAD.COM or MAXHI.COM. For information about the SETVER
command, see Chapter 14 of the "MS-DOS User's Guide and Reference."
<P>
The new version number is reported to all programs loaded by
386LOAD.COM and MAXHI.COM.
<P>
MAXHI.COM programs supplied with versions of 386MAX earlier than 5.0
are incompatible with MS-DOS 5.0.

Version 2.5 or later of the All Computers expanded-memory driver
(ALLEMM4.SYS) is compatible with MS-DOS 5.0 HIMEM.SYS. Contact All
Computers to get an updated driver.
<P>
<P><h3>3.3 Problems Loading into the Upper Memory Area</h3>
 
Some computers with bus master DMA controllers may not be able to load
device drivers or programs into the upper memory area. Add a
"DEVICE=SMARTDRV.EXE /DOUBLE_BUFFER" command before any DEVICEHIGH
commands in your CONFIG.SYS file. Make sure the command includes the
full path of the SMARTDRV.EXE file. For example, if the SMARTDRV.EXE
file is in the WINDOWS directory on drive C, the command would look
like this:
<P>
DEVICE=C:\WINDOWS\SMARTDRV.EXE /DOUBLE_BUFFER
<P>
Also, add an /L switch to the SMARTDRV.EXE command in your
AUTOEXEC.BAT file. This is required if you use the /DOUBLE_BUFFER
switch in your CONFIG.SYS file.
<P>
<P><h3>3.4 Intel Expanded-Memory Driver (EMM.SYS)</h3>
 
If you use Intel's EMM.SYS driver with Aboveboard, use EMM.SYS version
4.0 revision D or later. If you have an earlier version, contact Intel
for a free upgrade.
<P>
