The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you try to browse network connections from a Windows for Workgroups
3.11 workstation, you receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   There is not enough memory available.


</PRE><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, manually insert the path for the computer name
and share name.
<P>
You may also be able to work around this problem by doing one of the
following:

<UL><LI>Run MS-DOS Prompt from the Program Manager Main group, and type "exit"
   (without the quotation marks) to return to Windows for Workgroups.

<LI>Run MS-DOS Prompt from the Program Manager Main group, type "net view",
   (without the quotation marks) and then type "exit" (without the
   quotation marks)to return to Windows for Workgroups.

<LI>Increase the available conventional memory. Depending on your system
   configuration, you'll need 475 to 600K free for Windows for Workgroups
   to browse correctly.

<LI>Remove all applications from your Program Manager Startup group.

<LI>Use only one protocol.

<LI>If you are using a third-party shell, switch back to Program Manager.

<LI>The protocol file may be corrupt. Reinstall the protocol.

<LI>Disabling NETWORK DDE may allow you to browse when memory optimization
   fails.
<P>
</UL>NOTE: If running MS-DOS Prompt corrects the problem, create a one-line
batch file that reads COMMAND.COM /C. If running NET VIEW from MS-DOS
Prompt corrects the problem, create a one-line batch file that reads
COMMAND.COM /C NET VIEW. Name the batch file FIX.BAT and create an icon
in the Startup group using FIX.BAT as the command line and Browse Fix as
the Description.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows for Workgroups
version 3.11. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If you try to connect to a network drive in File Manager, you may see only
a workgroup name listed in the browse list. Trying to force the list of
computers to appear by choosing the workgroup name may cause the error
above to be displayed.
<P>
This error occurs only if the local computer is not providing the browse
list.
