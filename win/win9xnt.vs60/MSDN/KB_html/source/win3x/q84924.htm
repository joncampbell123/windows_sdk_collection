The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.1, 3.11
<LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The PC-Speaker driver included on the Microsoft Download (MSDL) service
allows some systems to play .WAV sound files through the computer's
internal speaker, but only for a limited time.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
If the PC-Speaker driver is playing .WAV files for only a limited time, the
Seconds To Limit Playback option may have been set to a low value, such as
1 or 2 seconds, during installation.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
The values you choose during installation are stored in the Windows
SYSTEM.INI file in the [speaker.drv] section. To modify these values, edit
the SYSTEM.INI file with a text editor such as Notepad, or do the
following:

<OL><P><LI>Run Control Panel.

<P><LI>Choose the Drivers icon.

<P><LI>From the list of drivers, select Sound Driver For PC-Speaker, and
   choose the Setup button.

<P><LI>Change the settings and choose the OK button.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The PC-Speaker is not guaranteed to operate on all machines because of
varying limitations in the speaker hardware. The following text was
taken from the SPEAKER.TXT file included with the PC-Speaker driver:
<P>
<PRE>   The PC-Speaker driver may not produce high-quality sound on all
   computer systems. The performance of the PC-Speaker driver is
   largely dependent upon the hardware itself. Microsoft does not
   guarantee that the speaker driver will work with all computer
   systems.
