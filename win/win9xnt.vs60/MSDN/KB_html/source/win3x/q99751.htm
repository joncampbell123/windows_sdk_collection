                             INTRODUCTION
                             ============

</PRE>This application note discusses installation requirements for
Microsoft Windows for Workgroups, the differences between the Setup
programs for Windows for Workgroups and Microsoft Windows operating
system version 3.1, new device drivers and files shipped with Windows
for Workgroups, and the administrative Setup options (the /A and /N
switches).
<P>
<P>
<PRE>                       INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS
                       =========================

</PRE>To install and use Windows for Workgroups you must be using MS-DOS
version 3.3 or later. To upgrade from a previous installation of
Windows, your Windows version must be 3.0 or later, and your Windows
files must be included in your PATH statement. (If you have a version
of Windows earlier than 3.0, you need to do a complete Windows for
Workgroups installation, not an upgrade.) If you want to preserve your
Program Manager groups and other existing Windows settings, you need
to install Windows for Workgroups in the directory of your current
Windows installation.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>DISK SPACE REQUIREMENTS</h2>
 
<P>
Windows for Workgroups requires approximately 4.5 megabytes (MB) more
disk space than Windows 3.1. The following table illustrates the disk
space requirements for the most common installation types.
<P>
<PRE>  Type of Installation         Windows 3.1   Windows for Workgroups 3.1
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------

  Full installation (286)           8.6 MB            13.8 MB
  Upgrade 3.x (286)                 5.2 MB             6.6 MB
  Full installation (386)           9.5 MB            15.0 MB
  Upgrade 3.x (386)                 5.2 MB            10.0 MB
  Network administrator (Setup /A) 15.3 MB            21.0 MB
  Network setup (Setup /N)           .3 MB             1.2 MB


</PRE><h2>SUPPORTED NETWORKS</h2>
 
<P>
The following networks are supported for use with Windows for
Workgroups:
<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft Workgroup Client (all versions)
   Microsoft LAN Manager (version 2.1)
   Novell(R) NetWare(R) (all versions)

</PRE>Before starting a shared copy of Windows for Workgroups that is
installed over one of these networks, please use the following
guidelines:
<P>
<P><h3>Novell NetWare Network</h3>
 
<P>
If you are running a shared copy of Windows for Workgroups on a Novell
workstation, be sure to log on to the Novell server before starting
Windows for Workgroups.
<P>
<P><h3>LAN Manager or Windows for Workgroups Network</h3>
 
<P>
If you are running a shared copy of Windows for Workgroups on a LAN
Manager or Windows for Workgroups workstation, be sure to start the
network workstation services before you start Windows for Workgroups.
You can do this with the "net start workstation" command.
<P>
If you are using the Windows for Workgroups network drivers, you can
start the workstation services automatically by placing either of the
following entries in the [network] section of your SYSTEM.INI file:
<P>
<PRE>   AUTOSTART=FULL
   AUTOSTART=BASIC

</PRE>Setting AUTOSTART to FULL installs the enhanced network redirector.
The enhanced redirector supports named pipes and LAN Manager
application programming interface (API) functions.
<P>
Setting AUTOSTART to BASIC installs the basic network redirector,
which uses less system memory but does not support named pipes.
<P>
Neither redirector supports network messaging services, or pop-up
messages.
<P>
LAN Manager automatically installs the redirector based on entries in
your AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS files. These settings are specified
in the LAN Manager network documentation.
<P>
<PRE>  NOTE: Setup adds the AUTOSTART switch for you if you are installing
  on a 286-based machine.


</PRE><h2>UNSUPPORTED NETWORKS</h2>
 
<P>
The following networks that are supported under Windows 3.1 are not
specifically supported in the Windows for Workgroups package.
(Drivers for these networks are not shipped with Windows for
Workgroups but might be available through your network vendor.)
<P>
<PRE>  No Network Installed
  Artisoft LANtastic (all versions)
  Banyan(R) VINES(R) (all versions)
  DEC(R) Pathworks(TM) (all versions)
  IBM(R) OS/2(R) LAN Server (all versions)
  IBM PC-LAN Program (all versions)
  Microsoft LAN Manager (version 2.0 and earlier)
  Microsoft Networks or compatible (all versions)
  TCS(R) 10Net (all versions)
  3Com(R) 3+Share(R) (all versions)
  3Com 3+Open(TM) (all versions)

</PRE>Setup does not detect these networks, and therefore cannot notify you
if they are installed on your system. Check with your network vendor
to obtain the necessary drivers before you install Windows for
Workgroups over any of these networks. Then, perform the procedure
below.
<P>
Drivers that support using Banyan VINES and DEC Pathworks with Windows
for Workgroups are available from Banyan Systems and Digital Equipment
Corporation.
<P>
<P><h3>To use Windows for Workgroups with a different network</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>  NOTE: This procedure won't be useful unless the drivers you obtained
  from your vendor are compatible with Windows for Workgroups.

</PRE><P><LI>Open Control Panel, and from the Settings menu, choose Network. (Or
   choose the Network icon.)

<P><LI>In the Network Settings dialog box, choose the Networks button.
   The Compatible Networks dialog box appears.

<P><LI>From the Available Network Types list, select Unlisted Or Updated
   Network, and then choose the Add button.
<P>
   You will be prompted to insert the disk containing the network
   driver supplied by your vendor. When you insert the floppy disk,
   Setup installs the network driver. The new network should now
   appear in the Available Network Types group.

<P><LI>Select the network, and then choose the Add button.
   This adds the network to the Other Networks In Use list.

<P><LI>Choose the OK button twice to exit the Networks dialog boxes. Close
   Control Panel and then reboot your machine.
<P>
<P><PRE>    Important: To use the new driver(s), you must reboot your machine.
</PRE><P>
<P>
<PRE>                   DIFFERENCES IN SETUP PROGRAMS FOR
              WINDOWS 3.1 AND WINDOWS FOR WORKGROUPS 3.1
              ==========================================

</PRE></OL>This section discusses new features in the Windows for Workgroups
Setup program, including network detection and dialog box changes.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>NETWORK-DETECTION ISSUES</h2>
 

<UL><LI>Setup no longer prompts for a network type.
<P>
   Setup always selects Windows for Workgroups as the network type.

<LI>Windows for Workgroups Setup performs network card detection.
<P>
   If Setup fails to detect your network card, it prompts you to
   choose from a list of available network adapters.
<P>
<P>
</UL><h2>DIFFERENCES IN DIALOG BOXES</h2>
 

<UL><LI>Setup now asks for the computer name and the workgroup in the
   initial user name dialog box.

<LI>After Setup completes printer installation, the Install New Network
   Adapter, Network Adapters, and Compatible Networks dialog boxes may
   appear, as the following table illustrates.
<P>
<PRE>    Dialog Box                     Express Setup    Custom Setup
    -------------------------------------------------------------

    Install New Network Adapter    Conditional      Conditional

    Network Adapters               No               Yes

    Compatible Networks            Conditional      Yes

   The Install New Network Adapter dialog box does not appear during
   either Express or Custom Setup if the Network Card Detection (NCD)
   utility detects your network card and you confirm the detected
   network card. Confirming the detected network card places a network
   adapter entry in PROTOCOL.INI. If you don't confirm the detected
   network card, then the Install New Network Adapter dialog box
   appears. If you are upgrading from a Workgroup Connection or LAN
   Manager 2.1 installation, there is already a valid network adapter
   entry in PROTOCOL.INI, and this dialog box is skipped.

   The Compatible Networks dialog box does not appear during Express
   Setup if you are upgrading from a LAN Manager 2.1 installation.
   Selecting a network in this dialog box places a multinet= entry in
   the [network] section of SYSTEM.INI. If Setup detects the existing
   LAN Manager 2.1 installation, Setup places the multinet= entry in
   SYSTEM.INI and therefore skips the Compatible Networks dialog box.

</PRE><LI>The option to Restart Windows once Setup is complete is no longer
   available.
<P>
   This is because in order to load or upgrade network drivers, you
   must reboot your machine.
<P>
<P>
<PRE>         DRIVERS AND FILES SHIPPED WITH WINDOWS FOR WORKGROUPS
         =====================================================

</PRE></UL>Setup does not delete drivers that were installed with Windows 3.1 but
not shipped with Windows for Workgroups. The following table shows the
drivers and files that are shipped with Windows 3.1 and Windows for
Workgroups.
<P>
<PRE>  Driver or File         Windows 3.1  Windows for Workgroups

                                      Workgroups does not detect this
                                      display. You must manually
                                      select the driver.

                                      TBM12.COM file, Setup copies the
                                      new driver and file to the
                                      Windows directory and modifies
                                      the AUTOEXEC.BAT file to point
                                      to the new (updated) driver and

         ADMINISTRATIVE SETUP OPTIONS (SETUP /A AND SETUP /N)
         ====================================================

</PRE>You run Setup with the /A and /N options to configure a workstation to
run Windows from a shared directory. Setup with the /A option
(Administrative Setup) copies all the files from the Windows
distribution disks to a single directory and marks them read only.
This directory can then be used to install and run a shared copy of
Windows. Setup /N sets up the shared copy of Windows.
<P>
In a stand-alone Windows 3.1 installation, the Windows directory and
SYSTEM subdirectory are on your personal hard drive. In a shared
Windows installation, the Windows directory can be located on the
user's hard disk drive or on a network drive, and can be customized
for each user. There is no SYSTEM subdirectory, as such, in a network
installation; system files are typically located in a shared directory
on a network server.
<P>
In Windows for Workgroups, as in Windows 3.1 running on a network, the
personal Windows directory contains all files with .INI, .GRP, and
.PIF extensions, as well as REG.DAT, WIN.COM, WINVER.EXE, and any MS-
DOS device driver files. The personal Windows directory may also
contain the MS-DOS network device drivers and the NET.EXE, MSIPX.COM,
and NETX.COM files. (These files may also be copied to the root
directory of the boot drive, as explained in the following section.)
The shared directory contains all other Windows files.
<P>
<P><h2>WHERE SETUP PLACES NETWORK FILES</h2>
 
<P>
The Windows 3.1 Setup program reads SETUP.INF to determine where to
install files. SETUP.INF uses the file classifications "windir" and
"sysdir" to refer to files that Setup installs in the Windows
directory and SYSTEM subdirectory, respectively.
<P>
The Windows for Workgroups Setup program reads NETWORK.INF to
determine where to install files. Setup places files with the windir
classification in the personal Windows directory and files with the
sysdir classification in a shared server directory. NETWORK.INF also
uses two new file classifications, "netdir" and "devdir." Where Setup
places these files depends on the type of installation.
<P>
Real-mode network device drivers (devdir files) are copied to the
personal Windows directory on a local nonremovable, noncompressed
drive. These include PROTMAN.DOS, PROTOCOL.INI, and WORKGRP.SYS. If
the personal Windows directory is on a remote, removable, or
compressed volume, then these files are copied to the root of the boot
drive. These device drivers must be correctly referenced in
CONFIG.SYS.
<P>
Real-mode network utilities and terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR)
programs (netdir files) are copied to the personal Windows directory
on a nonremovable hard disk. These include NET.EXE, MSIPX.COM,
NETX.COM, and ROUTE.COM. If the personal Windows directory is on a
remote or removable volume, these files are copied to the same
directory as the devdir files. These utilities and TSRs must be

<P>
<PRE>  NOTE: If your personal Windows directory is on a remote volume, you
  still need to have your own hard disk drive to run Windows for
  Workgroups. Windows for Workgroups does not support diskless
  workstations or systems with no hard disk drive.

</PRE>The following table illustrates where Setup places the netdir and
devdir files for different installations.

</PRE><h2>SETUP /H (BATCH MODE SETUP)</h2>
 
<P>
You can use Setup with the /H option to automate the Setup program.
Windows for Workgroups and Windows 3.1 come with a system-settings
template file called SETUP.SHH, which you can copy or modify to create
a custom system-settings file. In addition to the settings specified
in the Windows 3.1 template file, the Windows for Workgroups template
file includes parameters for the computer name, workgroup, network
card, protocol, and compatible network. The SETUP.SHH file is located
on Windows for Workgroups 3.1 Disk 1 and is copied to the shared
Windows for Workgroups directory when you run Setup /A. You can modify
the template file with any text editor that can save unformatted text
(ASCII) files.
<P>
For more information about batch mode setup, refer to Chapter 3 of the
"Microsoft Windows for Workgroups Resource Kit."
