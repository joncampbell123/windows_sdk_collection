The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows with Multimedia Extensions version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The following information is contained in the Windows with Multimedia
Extensions version 1.0 README.TXT file. The Setup program copies this
file to the Windows with Multimedia Extensions directory.
<P>
This information does not apply to later versions of Windows.
<P>
 
<P><h3>README.TXT ONLINE DOCUMENT</h3>
 
<P>
<P><h2>USING WINDOWS WITH MULTIMEDIA EXTENSIONS</h2>
 
<P>
This section describes information you need to know when running
Windows with Multimedia Extensions or installing the multimedia
extensions from the CD-ROM.
<P>
<P><h3>WINDOWS OPERATING MODES</h3>
 
<P>
Windows runs in three operating modes: real, standard, and 386
enhanced. Of these operating modes, the Multimedia extensions augment
the capabilities of Windows standard and 386 enhanced modes with
sound, photographic-quality images, and animation. The Multimedia
extensions are designed for data intensive applications and minimally
require a 80386sx PC platform for performance considerations.
<P>
You can run Windows 3.0 in real mode; however, you will be unable to
use the Multimedia extensions while using Windows real mode.
<P>
<P><h3>DISPLAY DRIVER SETTINGS</h3>
 
<P>
<P><h3>MCGA256 Driver</h3>
 
<P>
When setting up the display driver for Windows with Multimedia, the
SETUP program and the Display application from  the Control Panel
adjust several entries of the SYSTEM.INI  file. For the MCGA256 video
driver, the 386grabber entry in the [boot] section of SYSTEM.INI  is
assigned the driver vga.gr3 and may not update parts of a DOS box
window properly.
<P>
This may be solved by changing the line in SYSTEM.INI from
<P>
<PRE>   386grabber=vga.gr3

</PRE>to
<P>
<PRE>   386grabber=v7vga.gr3

</PRE><h3>Using a Display Driver with VRAM II</h3>
 
<P>
The VRAMII video card uses the VGAPAL.DRV video driver shipped with
Windows with Multimedia. You can use either this video driver or the
video driver that comes with the card.
<P>
The drivers MMV7VGA.DRV and V7VGA.DRV do not support this video card;
they support the VRAM I card.
<P>
<P><h3>WHEN DEVICE DRIVER ASSIGNMENTS BECOME EFFECTIVE</h3>
 
<P>
Windows with Multimedia loads its waveform, MIDI, joystick, and timer
drivers at boot time. You can install and change these driver
assignments at any time with the Drivers Control Panel application;
however, Windows with Multimedia doesn't make these changes during the
current Windows session. Instead, it records the changes for the next
session of Windows. To recognize driver changes once they've been
recorded, close and restart Windows.
<P>
<P><h3>RUNNING TSR PROGRAMS DURING SETUP</h3>
 
<P>
When you run SETUP for Windows with Multimedia, avoid invoking TSR
programs while the installation is running. That is, don't interrupt
the installation by starting TSR programs.
<P>
<P><h3>USING SCREEN SAVERS</h3>
 
<P>
The Multimedia extensions for Windows include screen saver
applications, which you can install from SETUP and from the Screen
Saver Control Panel application. For information about Screen Savers
included with the Multimedia extensions, see the HyperGuide section
entitled Appearances, in the Control Panel Concepts. The Control Panel
is part of the Main Group in HyperGuide.
<P>
Third party screen saver applications also exist and can conflict if
they are loaded concurrently in Windows. The main symptom of a
conflict is that the system fails to recognize keystrokes and mouse
movements once the Screen Saver assumes control of the system. To
remedy this situation, you must disable one of the screen savers.
<P>
To keep the Multimedia extensions Screen Saver, remove the third-party
screen saver from the files listed in the "load=" entry in the
[windows] section of the WIN.INI file. WIN.INI is located in your
Windows directory.
<P>
To keep the third-party screen saver, you must make two edits:

<OL><P><LI>In the WIN.INI file located in your Windows directory, remove
   SCRNSVR.EXE from the "load=" entry in the [Windows] section.

<P><LI>In the SYSTEM.INI file located in your Windows directory, remove
   the file name assigned to the "SCRNSAVE.EXE=" entry in the [boot]
   section.
<P>
</OL><h3>WORKING WITH CD-ROM DRIVES</h3>
 
<P>
To avoid problems, don't change discs in the CD-ROM drive while in the
middle of an operation (for example, getting a directory listing,
playing an audio segment from the CD-ROM, or playing an audio CD with
Music Box).
<P>
The MS-DOS COMP utility doesn't work when comparing files on a CD-ROM.
<P>
<P><h3>WORKING WITH THE MSCDEX CD-ROM DRIVER</h3>
 
<P>
Be careful when installing the CD-ROM driver MSCDEX.EXE from the
Windows DOS Prompt. MSCDEX doesn't check to find out whether it has
already been loaded before loading itself. Thus, you might encounter
situations in which multiple versions of MSCDEX are loaded on top of
one another. To make sure this doesn't occur, always install MSCDEX
from an AUTOEXEC.BAT file before starting the Windows graphical
environment.
<P>
MSCDEX can't be loaded into high memory (for example, using LOADHIGH
in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file).
<P>
<P><h3>CALIBRATING JOYSTICKS</h3>
 
<P>
Don't use the Joystick Control Panel application to calibrate a
joystick while running a game or other application that uses the
joystick.
<P>
<P><h3>USING SOUND RECORDER WITH EXCEL 3.0</h3>
 
<P>
The Sound Recorder accessory can be used for Object Linking and
Embedding (OLE) with applications that support OLE. Microsoft Excel
Version 3.0 allows you to use Sound Recorder to embed up to 32K of
data. You can link to data larger than 32K if the 32K limit on
embedded data is too small.
<P>
<P><h3>COPYING WINDOWS WITH MULTIMEDIA FILES FROM THE CD-ROM</h3>
 
<P>
The files on the Windows with Multimedia CD-ROM may be compressed.
Compressed files are not usable until they are expanded. Setup and
Control Panel expand the compressed files as they are copied onto your
hard disk.
<P>
If you need to copy files directly from the CD-ROM without using Setup
or Control Panel, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Copy EXPAND.EXE from the CD-ROM directory \xxxxx onto your hard
   drive. (This utility expands compressed files to a usable format.)

<P><LI>Type the following and press ENTER:
<P>
<P><PRE>      expand x:&lt;path\filename&gt; y:&lt;path\filename&gt;
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    where x: is the CD-ROM drive (source)
<PRE></PRE>          y: is the disk drive you are copying to (destination)

   The compressed file is expanded as it is copied onto your hard-disk
   drive.

</PRE></OL>System files (.SYS) are named SY$ as compressed files. For example,
MOUSE.SYS is named MOUSE.SY$; HIMEM.SYS, HIMEM.SY$ and so forth. When
you use Windows Setup to install these files, they are renamed with
.SYS extensions automatically.
<P>
If you use the expand utility to copy .SY$ files onto your hard disk,
you must change their filename extensions to .SYS. You can use the
MS-DOS Rename command or you can rename each file as you copy them
from the CD-ROM with the Expand command.
<P>
To rename a file when you expand it, type the following command and
press ENTER:
<P>
<PRE>   expand x:filename.sy$ c:\windirectory\filename.sys

</PRE>where x: is the CD-ROM drive (source), filename.sy$ is the name of the
compressed file you want to copy, \windirectory is the name of your
windows directory, and filename.sys is the renamed file that will
appear on your hard disk.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>LEARNING ABOUT WINDOWS APPLICATIONS IN HYPERGUIDE</h3>
 
<P>
The Quick Looks topics in the HyperGuide on-line documentation system
show how to use the programs provided in the Windows graphical
environment with multimedia extensions. For easy access to these
topics, you may want to copy the files that contain them from the
Windows with Multimedia CD-ROM to your hard disk. (These files may be
compressed on the CD-ROM; see the instructions in the preceding
section for copying compressed files.) Use the following procedure:

<OL><P><LI>Copy the Quick Look help files from the CD-ROM to your Windows
   directory. The Quick Look help files have "QL" as the last letters
   in their base names. If compressed, these files have extensions of
   .HL$. (For example, MQL.HL$ is the compressed help file for the
   Windows Program Manager.)  Otherwise, they have extensions of .HLP.
   If these files are are compressed, you must rename these files so
   they have extensions of .HLP after you expand them. (For example,
   you must rename PMQL.HL$ to PMQL.HLP after you expand it.)

<P><LI>Copy the file named QLHD.HL$ (if compressed) or QLHD.HLP (if
   uncompressed) from the CD-ROM to your Windows directory.  This file
   contains the Table of Contents for the Quick Look topics. If this
   file is compressed, you must change the filename to QLHD.HLP after
   you expand the file.

<P><LI>Copy the file named QUIKLOOK.IC$ (if compressed) or QUIKLOOK.ICO
   (if uncompressed) from the CD-ROM to your Windows directory.  This
   file contains the icon for the Quick Look topics.  If this file is
   compressed, you must change the filename to QUIKLOOK.ICO after you
   expand the file.

<P><LI>Add a new program item to any Program Manager group for the Quick
   Look topics. Specify QUIKLOOK.ICO as the icon file for the new
   program item. Specify the following command line for the program
   item:
<P>
<P><PRE>      winhelp qlhd.hlp
</PRE><P>
</OL>Now, anytime you want to learn how to run any Windows application,
simply select the Quick Look icon you created in step 4. Follow the
instructions in HyperGuide to learn about the application.
