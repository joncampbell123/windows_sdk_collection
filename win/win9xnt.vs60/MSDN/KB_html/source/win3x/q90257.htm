</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Windows for Workgroups Setup detects if LAN Manager 2.1 is running by
determining whether the LAN Manager redirector is present in memory.
If it is, Setup then tries to upgrade using the information in the LAN
Manager SETUP.INI file.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
LAN Manager 2.1 is only detected if it is loaded and running during
Setup. This means that the NET START WORKSTATION command must have
been executed in order for Setup to find it. Setup does not check the
CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT or any other file to find LAN Manager.
<P>
If Setup does find LAN Manager 2.1, it uses the information in the LAN
Manager 2.1 SETUP.INI file to upgrade the configuration to Windows for
Workgroups and to remove the LAN Manager statements from the
CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files.
<P>
Setup checks the SETUP.INI for the following entries:
<P>
<PRE>   [setup]
   DRIVER0 = card protocol [protocol [protocol [protocol]]]
   DRIVER1 = card protocol [protocol [protocol [protocol]]]
   DRIVER2 = (etc.)

</PRE>It then uses the [netcard] and [transport] sections in LM21DRV.UPD to
map the LAN Manager driver names to Windows for Workgroups driver
identification numbers. A new PROTOCOL.INI is created using the mapped
drivers. The settings for the drivers are copied from the LAN Manager
PROTOCOL.INI file.
<P>
If a mapping does not exist for a driver in SETUP.INI, Setup will warn
the user that the driver could not be upgraded and the driver will be
skipped. The user will have to add this device back by hand using the
Control Panel, which may require the use of Windows for Workgroups
compatible original equipment manufacturer (OEM) disks.
<P>
Setup uses the the [ConfigSys] and [StartupCmd] sections in SETUP.INI
file to delete any lines from the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files
that LAN Manager added. If the user has modified any of these lines so
that they no longer match the lines in the SETUP.INI file, they might
not be deleted. Setup also deletes any lines from the AUTOEXEC.BAT
file that contain these phrases: LOAD NETBEUI, LOAD TCPIP, NET START,
NET LOGON, or NET LOGIN.
