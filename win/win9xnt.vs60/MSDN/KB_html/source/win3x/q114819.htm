<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In July 1993, video board manufacturer Video Seven of Fremont, California,
closed its doors after being declared insolvent. Video Seven was founded in
1983 and was well known for its popular line of PC video boards. At the
time Video Seven shut its doors, it was partially owned by Spea Software
AG, a German graphics board manufacturer.
<P>
Spea Software AG of Starnberg, Germany, controls the license of the Video
Seven product name and currently sells several products under the
Spea/Video Seven brand name in Europe. Product support for most of the
newer Video Seven products (for example, VEGA VGA, VRAM II, 1024i Plus,
WIN.SWIFT, WIN.PRO, and WIN.VGA) released in the United States can be
obtained by contacting Spea Software AG in Germany.
