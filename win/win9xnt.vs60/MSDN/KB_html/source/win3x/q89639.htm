The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows Resource Kit version 2.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The NEWIPX utility, included with the Microsoft Windows Resource Kit for
operating system version 3.1, may not upgrade a Novell NetWare IPX.COM file
if it is unable to determine the current IPX.COM configuration.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
NEWIPX uses the Novell NetWare linker (NLINK.EXE) to generate a new IPX.COM
with an updated version of IPX.OBJ. To do this, NEWIPX must be able to
determine the current configuration of the IPX.COM file before making any
changes to it. If NEWIPX cannot determine the current IPX.COM
configuration, then it will be unable to configure the newly generated
IPX.COM so that it will still work. In this case, NEWIPX returns the error
message:
<P>
<PRE>   Error: cannot duplicate original settings from "IPX.COM" in upgrade.
   No upgrade performed.

</PRE>At this point the IPX.COM is still intact and has not been modified.
<P>
If NEWIPX cannot determine the current IPX.COM configuration, the
problem may be related to the IPX.COM file having a "Configurable by
Jumpers" option.
<P>
When an IPX.COM is generated using the "Jumpers Configurable" option
(assuming it has this option), initially it will be unusable until the
JUMPERS utility is run to configure the IPX.COM. If an IPX.COM file
has been generated in this way and has not yet been configured by
JUMPERS, the NEWIPX utility cannot determine the configuration and
returns the above error message.
<P>
The Novell NetWare IPX.COM file is generated from two parts:

<OL><P><LI>An IPX.OBJ file, which is what NEWIPX attempts to upgrade.

<P><LI>A network-card specific .OBJ file. This file is referred to as the
   "driver" and is specific to the Network Interface Card (NIC).
<P>
</OL>These parts are linked together by NLINK.EXE, the Novell NetWare
linker, using either the WSGEN or SHGEN Novell utilities, depending
upon the version of Novell NetWare in use. (SHGEN and WSGEN both
generate IPX.COM files.)
<P>
An IPX.COM file has a fixed list of configuration options dependent on
the driver. Some drivers, however, have an option that allows the
Novell NetWare JUMPERS utility to be used to select the IRQ, I/O Base
Address, and Base Memory address individually.
<P>
For more information on WSGEN, JUMPERS, SHGEN, NLINK, or IPX.COM files
and their configuration, consult your Novell NetWare documentation.
<P>
For information on using the NEWIPX utility, see the IPX.WRI file that
ships with NEWIPX in the Windows 3.1 Resource Kit.
<P>
The NetWare Turbo RX-Net ARCnet driver is an example of a
JUMPERS-configurable driver that ships with Novell NetWare version
3.11.
