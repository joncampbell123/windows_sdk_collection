The "Windows Solution for Faulty Pentium Floating-Point Unit" (WW1140)
Application Note contains a utility called PENTFIX.EXE. The PENTFIX.EXE
utility automatically disables the Intel Pentium floating-point hardware
that contains the floating-point division accuracy error. When you use
the PENTFIX.EXE utility, the Pentium behaves similarly to an Intel 486SX
or 386 that does not contain floating-point processing hardware.

</PRE><h3>Introduction</h3>
 
<P>
The WW1140 disk included with this Application Note contains a utility
called PENTFIX.EXE. The PENTFIX.EXE utility automatically disables the
Intel(R) Pentium floating-point hardware that contains the floating-
point division accuracy error. When you use the PENTFIX.EXE utility,
the Pentium behaves similarly to an Intel 486SX or 386 that does not
contain floating-point processing hardware.
<P>
