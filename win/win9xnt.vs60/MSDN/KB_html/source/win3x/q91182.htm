</PRE><h3>Changes to the MS-DOS-Based Portion of Setup</h3>
 
<P>
The Workgroup upgrade for Microsoft Windows version 3.0 users and the
Workgroup upgrade for Microsoft Windows version 3.1 users perform a
version check and require a previous version of Windows installed on
the system. Setup looks for the WIN.COM file.
<P>
During hardware detection, networks supported for Windows 3.1 are
detected to determine compatibility with Windows for Workgroups. Only
Workgroup Connections, NetWare, and Microsoft LAN Manager version 2.1
are compatible with Windows for Workgroups.
<P>
The networks list is not shown in the system settings; WFWNET.DRV is
the only supported primary network for this version. NetWare can be
added as a secondary network later in the Windows-based portion of
Setup.
<P>
SETUP /I disables hardware detection, including network software
detection, and initiates Custom Setup instead of Express Setup by
default.
<P>
<P><h3>Changes to the Graphics-Based Portion of Setup</h3>
 
<P>
The first event in the graphics-based portion of Windows for
Workgroups Setup is network card detection (NCD). If the system stops
responding (hangs) at the transition from the MS-DOS-based portion of
Setup to the Windows-based portion of Setup (at the blue "Windows
Setup" screen), it is probably because of NCD.
<P>
To recover from this situation, restart the computer and run Setup
again. Setup leaves a flag in the SYSTEM.INI file so that NCD is not
run the second time. Running Setup with the /I parameter also disables
NCD.
<P>
The user-information dialog box now contains computer name and
workgroup in addition to the user's name and company.
<P>
If MCSDEX.EXE or TBMI2.COM are in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file, Setup copies
a new version of these files to the WINDOWS directory and replaces the
lines calling these files in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file. The /y parameter
is also added to the MSCDEX line. The mouse is handled in a similar
fashion.
<P>
Network adapters, protocols, and secondary network drivers are added
right after printer installation.
<P>
The Exit Setup dialog box no longer contains the Restart Windows
option because the network drivers (WORKGRP.SYS and so forth) must be
loaded by restarting the computer.
<P>
<P><h3>Changes to Maintenance Mode of Setup</h3>
 
<P>
The networks list is not shown in the system settings; WFWNET.DRV is
the only supported primary network for this version. The Network
Adapter and Compatible Networks dialog boxes are available from the
Control Panel Networks option and are not available from Setup in
maintenance mode.
<P>
