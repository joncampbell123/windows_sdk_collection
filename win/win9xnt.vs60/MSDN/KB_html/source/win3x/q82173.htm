<P><h3>WordPerfect for Windows</h3>
 
<P>
If you have been running WordPerfect version 5.1 with Windows version
3.0 and you find that it runs differently with Windows version 3.1,
you need to obtain an updated version of Wordperfect.

<P>
<P><h3>WordStar for Windows</h3>
 
<P>
If you have been running WordStar for Windows with Windows version
3.0, you might see some differences when you run this application with
Windows version 3.1. For example, some elements of the WordStar screen
might not be displayed the same as they were in Windows version 3.0.
<P>
Windows version 3.1 uses descriptive printer-model names for printer
drivers. Because WordStar does not recognize the new names, you need
to update your WordStar templates. Do this by opening a template,
selecting the printer you are using, and then saving the new
information in the template.
<P>
To obtain an updated version of WordStar for Windows, contact your
software vendor or call Wordstar International, Incorporated, at
1-800-227-5609. Outside the United States, contact your local software
vendor or WordStar subsidiary.
