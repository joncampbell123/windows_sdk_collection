The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Attempting to run the DBASE.EXE file on a network either from a PIF,
File Manager, or directly from the Windows command line results in the
following Windows error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Insufficient Memory To Run Application

</PRE>This is caused by running DBASE.EXE rather than DBASE.COM on a network
version of dBASE IV versions 1.0 and 1.1.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
DbASE IV can be installed specifically to run on a network that will
allow for multiple-user access. If dBASE IV is installed in this way,
DBASE.COM is the executable file that is created. If dBASE IV is not
installed to run on a network it will create a DBASE.EXE file that
cannot be run off the network and work correctly.
<P>
It is possible to run DBASE.EXE from within Windows 3.0 by executing
it from the MS-DOS command line under Windows or by creating a batch file
that calls it. However, this is not a recommended way to run dBASE IV
on a network and is unstable according to Ashton-Tate.
