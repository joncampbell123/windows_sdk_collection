  NOTE: Microsoft has tested the Microsoft Windows operating system on
  versions 3.1 or later of MS-DOS and PC-DOS. However, we cannot
  ensure the success of running Windows with DR-DOS from Digital
  Research(R). Digital Research has announced the availability of a
  software update for running Windows with DR-DOS. You may want to
  obtain this update as an alternative to the following procedure.
  However, Microsoft neither ensures the stability of nor endorses
  running Microsoft Windows version 3.1 on DR-DOS with or without
  Digital Research's software update.

</PRE>When you install Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1 with
DR-DOS, Windows may display the following message when it enters the
graphical user interface (GUI) mode of Windows Setup:
<P>
<PRE>   Standard Mode: Fault in MS-DOS Extender

</PRE><h3>Recovering Windows 3.0</h3>
 
<P>
The above message indicates a failed Windows 3.1 installation. If you
receive this message when you try to upgrade from Windows 3.0 to
Windows 3.1, you will be unable to start Windows. The following set of
instructions allow you to return to a functional Windows 3.0
installation after a failed installation of Windows 3.1:

<OL><P><LI>Restart your computer.

<P><LI>Change the current directory to the Windows directory. For example,
   if Windows is installed on drive C in the WINDOWS directory, type
   the following at the C:\&gt; command prompt and press ENTER:
<P>
<P><PRE>      cd windows
</PRE>
<P><LI>Rename all the .INI and .GRP files in the Windows directory to .INN
   and .GRN by typing the following at the command prompt and pressing
   ENTER after each line:
<P>
<P><PRE>      rename *.ini *.inn
      rename *.grp *.grn
</PRE>
<P><LI>Delete the WINVER.EXE file from the Windows directory. This will
   allow Windows 3.0 to update all the Windows files. To delete this
   file, type the following at the command prompt:
<P>
<P><PRE>      del winver.exe
</PRE>
<P><LI>Reinstall Windows 3.0 to the Windows directory with the previous
   configuration options (accept the previous configuration options
   that the Windows Setup program displays).
<P>
   Do not select any of the options in the graphics mode of Windows
   3.0 Setup (that is, Printers, Setup Applications, Read Documents,
   and modify the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files).
<P>
   If you do not have enough disk space to install Microsoft Windows
   version 3.0, you will receive the message:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Your System does not have enough free disk space. Windows
      requires a minimum of 6300000 bytes of free disk space for
      installation.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    Note: If you receive this message, see the section "If Disk Space
    Is Limited" later in this document.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Copy all the .INN and .GRN files to the same name with the original
   extensions (.INI and .GRP), by typing the following at the command
   prompt:
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy *.inn *.ini
      copy *.grn *.grp
</PRE>
<P><LI>Copy the SYSINI.W31 and WININI.W31 files to SYSTEM.INI and WIN.INI,
   respectively, by typing the following at the command prompt. The
   .W31 files are the backup .INI files that Windows 3.1 created
   during the failed upgrade to Windows 3.1.
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy sysini.w31 system.ini
      copy winini.w31 win.ini
</PRE>
<P><LI>Delete the W8D40P2T.A4G file in the Windows directory by typing the
   following at the command prompt. This file is used by Windows 3.1
   to start the graphics mode of Setup.
<P>
<P><PRE>      del w8d40p2t.a4g
</PRE><P>
</OL>All object linking and embedding (OLE) functionality will be intact
for pre-Windows 3.1 OLE applications such as version 3.0 of Microsoft
Excel and version 2.0 of Microsoft Word for Windows.
<P>
<P><h3>If Disk Space Is Limited</h3>
 
<P>
To set up Windows 3.0 on a system with limited hard disk space, you
may need to temporarily adjust the Windows 3.0 SETUP.INF file. Before
you reinstall Windows 3.0 (step 5 of the "Recovering Windows 3.0"
procedure above), do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Copy the SETUP.EXE and SETUP.INF files from Windows 3.0 Disk 1 to a
   separate directory on the hard disk. For example, if you insert
   Disk 1 in drive A and want to copy the files to the root directory,
   type the following at the command prompt:
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy a:\setup.exe c:\
      copy a:\setup.inf c:\
</PRE>
<P><LI>Use a DOS-based editor, such as DR-DOS Editor, to edit the [DATA]
   section of this SETUP.INF file for Windows 3.0. When you open the
   file, the [DATA] section will read as follows:
<P>
<P><PRE>      [DATA]
      neededspace386=6300000
      space386upgrade=2000
      neededspace286=4500000
      space286upgrade=1000
</PRE><P>
   Change the values for neededspace386= and neededspace286= as
   follows:
<P>
<P><PRE>      neededspace386=1
      neededspace286=1
</PRE>
<P><LI>Run Windows Setup from the directory with the adjusted SETUP.INF
   file (in this example, the adjusted SETUP.INF file is in the root
   directory).

<P><LI>After Windows Setup is complete, copy the Windows 3.0 SETUP.INF
   file from Disk 1 to the Windows 3.0 SYSTEM subdirectory. For
   example, if you insert Disk 1 in drive A and your Windows directory
   is on drive C and is named WIN, type the following at the command
   prompt:
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy a:\setup.inf c:\win\system
</PRE><P>
</OL>For more information on running Microsoft Windows with DR-DOS, please
contact Digital Research.
