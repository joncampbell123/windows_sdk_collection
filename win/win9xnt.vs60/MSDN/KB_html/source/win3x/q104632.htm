<P><h3>Introduction</h3>
 
<P>
This Application Note contains updated Windows for Workgroups files
(NET.EXE, WORKGRP.SYS, VREDIR.386, and VBROWSE.386) and information
about using these files with a Novell NetWare version 4.0 client
configuration. Providing Windows for Workgroups support for NetWare
4.0 first requires proper installation of Novell's client software. If
the setup steps described in this document do not function properly,
contact Novell for more information. Microsoft can ensure connectivity
between Windows for Workgroups and Novell NetWare only when you are
running MSIPX.COM. If you cannot enable the open data-link interface
(ODI) drivers using Novell's procedure (included with NetWare 4.0),
call Novell Technical Support at (800) 638-9273.
<P>
Although the current specification of Windows for Workgroups is MSIPX,
an exclusively NDIS-compliant protocol, Novell's ODINSUP.COM, allows
NDIS protocol stacks to run unmodified over the ODI link support layer
(LSL) and talk to an ODI LAN driver. Novell's LSL can be accessed by
using the ODINSUP driver. Microsoft recommends using ODINSUP.COM
version 1.22 with this Application Note. Novell makes this file
available on its bulletin board service and in the Novell
CompuServe(R) forum. The current filename is DOSUP7.ZIP. For more
availability information, contact Novell or look on the Novell
CompuServe forum.
<P>
When you use ODINSUP.COM with Windows for Workgroups and NetWare 4.0,
the following configuration files are modified:
<P>
<PRE>   CONFIG.SYS
   STARTNET.BAT or AUTOEXEC.BAT
   NET.CFG
   PROTOCOL.INI
   SYSTEM.INI

</PRE><h3>Before You Begin</h3>
 
<P>
Since this configuration requires the Novell IPXODI drivers, set up
your machines and connect to a Novell server from an MS-DOS command
prompt using IPXODI.COM before proceeding with the setup instructions
below. Be sure to back up your files so that you can restore your
original configuration if necessary.
<P>
<P><h3>Setup Instructions</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Install Windows for Workgroups with your network interface card
   (NIC) and with Novell NetWare as a secondary network.

<P><LI>Run the Novell NetWare 4.0 client installation program.

<P><LI>Edit the CONFIG.SYS file and remove or remark out (using the REM
   command) the following lines
<P>
<P><PRE>      device=c:\windows\&lt;drivername.xxx&gt;
      device=c:\windows\msipx.sys
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;drivername.xxx&gt; is the name of your NDIS network card
   driver. If you already have ODI connections, these entries are not
   present.
<P>
<P><PRE>    NOTE: The NetWare 4.0 installation program changes the LASTDRIVE=
    statement from drive P to drive Z. Leave this change intact.
</PRE>
<P><LI>By default, the NetWare 4.0 installation program creates a
   STARTNET.BAT file (from which the NetWare files are run) in the
   NWCLIENT subdirectory. You need to edit this file unless the
   NetWare drivers are to be loaded from the AUTOEXEC.BAT file (in
   which case, you need to make the same changes in the AUTOEXEC.BAT
   file). If these drivers are loading from the AUTOEXEC.BAT file,
   remove the @CALL STARTNET.BAT line, which the NetWare installation
   procedure inserts. When you are finished editing the STARTNET.BAT
   or AUTOEXEC.BAT file, it should read as follows:
<P>
<PRE>  Lines                          Comments
</PRE></OL> 
<PRE>  SET NWLANGUAGE=ENGLISH         This is new under 4.0.

  LSL

  ODI MAC driver for your NIC    For example, this line would read
                                 NE2000 if you have an Novell NE2000
                                 NIC.

  ODINSUP.COM                    Manually add this driver from the
                                 DOSUP7.ZIP file.

  C:\WINDOWS\NET START NETBIND   Make sure this line is in either
                                 your AUTOEXEC.BAT or STARTNET.BAT,
                                 depending on which one is used to
                                 start NetWare connectivity.

  IPXODI

  VLM.EXE                        This file replaces NETX.EXE in
                                 NetWare 4.0.

</PRE><P><LI>In the AUTOEXEC.BAT file, remove or remark out the following lines:
<P>
<P><PRE>      c:\windows\net start
      c:\windows\msipx.com
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    IMPORTANT: Steps 6 and 7 provide the changes made in the NET.CFG
    and PROTOCOL.INI files if you are using a Novell NE2000 NIC. If
    you are using a different card, many of the changes made will be
    specific to your NIC and therefore different than those below.
</PRE>
<P><LI>To use ODINSUP.COM with Windows for Workgroups 3.1, the NET.CFG
   file should appear as follows. Some of the settings below appear as
   a result of the NetWare 4.0 installation program; you may need to
   manually edit others.
<P>
<P><PRE>    NOTE: If you were using ODINSUP.COM with NetWare 3.11, the 4.0
    installation removes the changes that were made to the NET.CFG
    file. The final file should read as follows:
</PRE><P>

</PRE></OL> 
<PRE>PB BUFFERS 7                     This line is added.

PROTOCOL ODINSUP                 This line exists if ODI is
                                 installed before you begin this
                                 procedure.
   BIND NE2000                   If you are using a NIC other than
                                 the NE2000, a different MAC driver
                                 appears here.
   BUFFERED

Link Driver NE2000               This line varies depending on the
                                 NIC you are using.
   Port &lt;XXX&gt;                    This line is set to the I/O base
                                 being used.
   INT &lt;XX&gt;                      This line is set to the IRQ being
                                 used. Both the Port and INT
                                 settings assume that the defaults
                                 are not being used. If the defaults
                                 are being used, these lines do not
                                 appear.
   MEM &lt;XXXXX&gt;                   This line appears only if your NIC
                                 is memory address configurable.
   Frame Ethernet_802.2          These frame types are required.
   Frame Ethernet_802.3
   Frame Ethernet_II
   Frame Ethernet_SNAP
   Protocol IPX 0 Ethernet_802.3
</PRE>NetWare DOS Requester
<PRE>   First Network Drive = F       This setting is new with NetWare
                                 4.0 and is the reason LASTDRIVE no
                                 longer needs to be set to P.
