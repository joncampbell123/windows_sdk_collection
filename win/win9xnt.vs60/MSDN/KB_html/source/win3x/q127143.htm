The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11
<LI>Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you are running the SMARTDrive Monitor tool (SMARTMON.EXE) that is
shipped with Microsoft MS-DOS version 6.0 or higher, the tool does not
report any caching information for SMARTDRV.EXE even though SMARTDRV.EXE
is loaded properly.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The SMARTDrive Monitor tool does not show SMARTDrive caching information
for the following types of drives:

<UL><LI>Drives that are not cached.

<LI>Network drives.

<LI>CD-ROM drives.

<LI>Hard disks running in Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 with
   32-bit file access enabled.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Drives That Are Not Cached</h3>
 
<P>
SMARTMON.EXE cannot report cache information for a drive if caching for
that drive has been disabled.
<P>
<P><h3>Network Drives</h3>
 
<P>
SMARTDrive does not cache network drives, so SMARTMON.EXE cannot report
cache information for these drives.
<P>
<P><h3>CD-ROM Drives</h3>
 
<P>
SMARTMON.EXE version 1.03 does not recognize the caching of CD-ROM drives
because it was not designed to do so. SMARTMON.EXE 1.03 was originally
released with Microsoft MS-DOS version 6.0, which includes SMARTDrive
version 4.0. SMARTDrive version 4.0 does not cache CD-ROM drives.
<P>
<P><h3>Hard Disks Using 32-Bit File Access</h3>
 
<P>
The 32-bit file access feature in Windows for Workgroups 3.11 uses a 32-bit
protect-mode cache (VCACHE.386) that replaces SMARTDRV.EXE at the Windows
level. When you use the 32-bit file access feature, SMARTDRV.EXE caches
only floppy and CD-ROM drives. SMARTMON.EXE does not report caching
information for hard disks using the 32-bit file access feature because
VCACHE.386 has disabled the hard disk caching in SMARTDRV.EXE.
<P>
The only way to work around this behavior is to not use the 32-bit file
access feature in Windows for Workgroups 3.11. You may not want to disable
the 32-bit file access feature, however, because doing so causes you to
lose the performance increases that 32-bit file access and VCACHE.386
provide over SMARTDrive's real-mode caching.
