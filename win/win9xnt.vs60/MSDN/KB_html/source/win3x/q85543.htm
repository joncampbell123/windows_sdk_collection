The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The following error message may appear when starting Windows 3.0 or
3.1:
<P>
<PRE>   Bookmarks are damaged. Delete WINHELP.BMK. Choose OK to delete the
   bookmark and continue. The bookmark has been damaged or corrupted.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
A bookmark allows quick return to a specific location in a Windows Help
topic. The bookmark menu defines shortcuts to find specific topics in Help
instead of looking through two or three levels to find the information.
<P>
If the bookmarks are damaged or corrupt, the above error message is
displayed. To correct this problem, delete the WINHELP.BMK file.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To keep the error from recurring, delete the file WINHELP.BMK from the
Windows directory. (Note that you may need to do this from the MS-DOS
command prompt.) Then, exit exiting and restart Windows to reset the
bookmarks.
<P>
NOTE: Deleting the WINHELP.BMK file removes all the existing bookmarks.
Previous bookmarks should be redefined.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To define a bookmark, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>From the Help Index, select a topic where a bookmark is desired.

<P><LI>From the Bookmark menu, choose Define.

<P><LI>Enter a Bookmark name (up to 20 characters in length).

<P><LI>Choose OK to add it to the list of bookmarks at the bottom of the
   Bookmark menu.
<P>
</OL>Help automatically puts a number next to the bookmark for quick
keyboard access. To return to a topic of interest, open the Bookmark
menu and choose the defined Bookmark name (or type the number next to
the bookmark). Help displays the topic.
<P>
WINHELP.BMK is placed in the Windows directory and must remain there
for Windows Help to be able to retrieve defined bookmarks.
<P>
Windows Help is unable to generate a list of defined bookmarks if
WINHELP.BMK is removed from the Windows directory (even if the file is
placed in a directory that lies within the search path).
