<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When using Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1 with OLE version
1.0, it is possible to share an object (create a link to a piece of data)
that is located on a network file server. To do this, both the client
application and the server application must be installed on the same local
machine.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To establish an OLE communication, both the server and the client
application must be installed on the same machine. The interprocess
communication that OLE uses (dynamic data exchange -- DDE) is not
supported across the network, only locally. The information, either
the container document or the source of the linked object, can be on
the network server.
<P>
In the case of a linked object, the network address for the file that
contains the object is stored with the object. When the object is
activated, OLE tries to bind to the object. If the network file server
is not connected, OLE will attempt to make the connection. If the file
server has a password, then OLE will ask for the password. If the
connection cannot be established, or if the file is not found, an
error message is displayed:
<P>
<PRE>   Linked document is unavailable.

</PRE>There is no known limit to the number of connections or links to a
network file server, except available drive letters.
