The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After running the CorelDRAW 3.0 Setup program from the CD-ROM, it may take
up to 15 minutes to start WordPerfect for Windows. WordPerfect for Windows
may also start slowly when you select a printer driver in WordPerfect for
Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When installing CorelDRAW 3.0 from the CD, it will add approximately 250
TrueType fonts (unless otherwise specified). These fonts are added to any
existing font packages installed, such as the TrueType font pack or the
standard set of Windows 3.1 TrueType fonts.
<P>
When WordPerfect is started, it looks for a .WRS printer file. If this file
is not available, it will create one. The .WRS file is also updated
whenever the Windows printer driver settings are changed (including
changing paper orientation, size, source, and the available fonts).
<P>
The large number of fonts installed by CorelDRAW are what cause the very
long start time for WordPerfect for Windows. WordPerfect is translating the
Windows 3.1 printer driver settings into a format that WordPerfect can use.
<P>
Either of the following two workarounds prevent WordPerfect from reading
the fonts in the WIN.INI file, allowing WordPerfect to start normally.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Workaround One</h3>
 

<UL><LI>If the WordPerfect for Windows version date is 11-4-91, make sure
   the following line is added to the [COMPATIBILITY] section of the
   WIN.INI file:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Win2wrs=0x01210
</PRE>
<LI>If the WordPerfect for Windows version date is 4-30-92, make sure
   the above line is removed from the [COMPATIBILITY] section of the
   WIN.INI file. The installation program should remove the line from
   the section.
<P>
</UL><h3>Workaround Two</h3>
 
<P>
Set the attribute on all .WRS printer files to read-only by using the
MS-DOS Attrib command:
<P>
<PRE>   attrib +r *.wrs

</PRE>For more information on the maximum number of TrueType fonts, query on
the following words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   TrueType and font and max
