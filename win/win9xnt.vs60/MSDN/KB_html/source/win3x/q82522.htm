<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article contains information on the following topics concerning
running Aldus PageMaker version 4.0 and Microsoft Windows:

<UL><LI>GP Fault Exiting PageMaker
<LI>PageMaker GP Faults Printing Imported Micrografx File
<LI>GP Fault in PageMaker 4.0 Using Leaders with Tabs Feature
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>GP Fault Exiting PageMaker</h3>
 
<P>
Aldus PageMaker 4.0 may cause a general protection (GP) fault when you
quit PageMaker after printing several documents in Windows 3.1. This
error occurs if you print multiple files one after the other without
closing the last file loaded. You may be able to work around this
problem by closing each file before you load the next file you want to
print.
<P>
Note: With Windows 3.0, this error occurs as a unrecoverable
application error.
<P>
<P><h3>PageMaker GP Faults Printing Imported Micrografx File</h3>
 
<P>
PageMaker 4.0 produces a GP fault if you attempt to print an imported
Micrografx Charisma file to a Hewlett-Packard (HP) LaserJet Series III
printer when using Windows 3.1. This problem can also occur with
Micrografx Designer and Draw.
<P>
Note: With Windows 3.0, this error occurs as a unrecoverable
application error.
<P>
To work around this problem, do not use the PageMaker Place command to
import the graphic. Instead, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Start Charisma and select the graphic.

<P><LI>From the Edit menu, choose Copy.

<P><LI>Start PageMaker.

<P><LI>From the Edit menu, choose Paste.
<P>
</OL><h3>GP Fault in PageMaker 4.0 Using Leaders with Tabs Feature</h3>
 
<P>
If you are using the PageMaker 4.0 Leaders with Tabs (table of
contents) feature and you increase the font size to 7 points or
greater, you may receive a general protection (GP) fault when you
print from PageMaker or from another application running with Windows
3.1. In addition, you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   PageMaker caused a General Protection Fault in PM4.EXE at 0049:00FC

</PRE></OL>This error occurs if you use Tabs with Dot Leaders but there isn't
enough space between the words for PageMaker to image the dots.
Reducing the point size of the text or eliminating the dot-leaders
should correct this problem as long as PageMaker allows the text to be
imaged.
<P>
If PageMaker cannot display the text, and therefore continues to cause
GP faults, you can work around the problem with the following
procedure:

<OL><P><LI>Restart PageMaker without opening the file causing the GP fault.

<P><LI>Adjust the application window so that only the title bar and the
   menu bar are visible.

<P><LI>Open the document that causes the GP fault. Since PageMaker doesn't
   have to image the file, it can open the document without causing a GP
   fault.

<P><LI>From the Edit menu, choose Preferences, then choose Other.

<P><LI>Set Stretch Text Above and Vector Text Above to 650 pixels and
   choose OK.

<P><LI>Set Greek Text Below to 650 pixels and choose OK.

<P><LI>Save the document.

<P><LI>When you adjust the application window and the document window, all
   the text on screen should be in Greek, allowing you to reduce the
   point size, increase the space between words, or eliminate the
   dot-leaders.

<P><LI>Change the Greek Text Below setting to the previous level to see
   the text again.
<P>
</OL>Greeked text allows PageMaker to indicate where the text should be by
displaying gray bars instead of text. This way PageMaker doesn't
attempt to display any of the text, or in this case, the dots that
should be between the text. Aldus has confirmed this to be a problem
in PageMaker 4.0. For more information, contact Aldus Technical
Support at (425) 628-2040.
