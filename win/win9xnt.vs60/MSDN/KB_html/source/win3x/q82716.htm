The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The process of upgrading from Microsoft Windows operating system version
3.0 to Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1 requires that the
character (MS-DOS) mode portion of Setup disable certain Windows 3.0
components. These components must be replaced by new 3.1 components so that
they don't interfere with the upgrade process. The Windows 3.1 Setup
program temporarily disables the following items:

<UL><LI>All fonts except the system, fixed pitch, and OEM fonts.

<LI>The shell (Program Manager, Norton Desktop for Windows, and so
   on).

<LI>The desktop bitmap.

<LI>Screen savers.

<LI>The Task Manager.

<LI>Installable drivers loaded through the drivers= line in the
   SYSTEM.INI file.
<P>
</UL>If the Setup process is interrupted before the Windows graphical user
interface (GUI) mode portion has been completed, some or all of the
above items may not be properly reenabled.
<P>
To regain Windows 3.0 functionality, the WIN.INI and SYSTEM.INI files
must be edited as described below.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To restore the disabled Windows 3.0 components that are controlled by
the SYSTEM.INI file, rename the following lines in the SYSTEM.INI
file; do NOT alter the information to the right of the equal sign:
<P>
<PRE>   Windows Component     Section       Line to Rename    New Name
   -----------------     -------       --------------    --------

   Shell                 [boot]        oldshell=         shell=

   Task Manager          [boot]        oldtaskman=       taskman=

   Installable drivers   [boot]        olddrivers=       drivers=

</PRE>To restore the disabled Windows 3.0 component that is controlled by
the WIN.INI file, rename the following line in the WIN.INI file; do
NOT alter the information to the right of the equal sign:
<P>
<PRE>   Windows Component     Section       Line to Rename    New Name
   -----------------     -------       --------------    --------

   Desktop bitmap        [desktop]     oldwallpaper=     wallpaper=

   Note: The screen savers should always be properly reenabled, and
   therefore should require no changes to be made.

</PRE>Fonts are disabled by renaming the [fonts] section in the WIN.INI file
to [wt4gpi8s56bz]. Setup can encounter problems with reenabling the
old fonts if the system memory is very low or if two aborted
installations have occurred. If there is a problem, Setup will display
a message box telling you that trouble was encountered when restoring
the previously installed fonts and that the [fonts] and [wt4gpi8s56bz]
sections must be merged by hand. This merging process is fairly
simple.
<P>
To merge the two sections, open the WIN.INI file in a text editor (for
example, the MS-DOS version 5.0 Editor), and do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Delete any line from the [wt4gpi8s56bz] section that is
   duplicated in the [fonts] section.

<P><LI>Append the contents of the [wt4gpi8s56bz] section to the [fonts]
   section.

<P><LI>Delete the [wt4gpi8s56bz] section.
<P></OL>
