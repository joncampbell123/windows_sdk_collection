<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1's SYSTEM.INI
MaxCOMPort switch can be used to increase the number of COM ports that
the enhanced-mode Windows Virtual Communications Device (VCD) can
support. Obtaining support for more than four COM ports for Windows
applications still requires a different communications driver.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
A system may have more than four COM ports. IBM originally provided
space for four COM ports in the BIOS port table in its first PC, so
four is the limit for a default configuration for MS-DOS. To support
more than four ports, a special MS-DOS device driver is necessary.
Addressing the additional COM ports is the responsibility of this
device driver. Most MS-DOS communications applications talk directly
to the port hardware, so some of them do support more than four COM
ports without requiring a special MS-DOS device driver.
<P>
The Windows communications driver (COMM.DRV) also assumes a limit of
four COM ports. It is possible for a COM driver to support more, but
the interface routines in USER.EXE limits the maximum to nine. There
is no method to configure COMM.DRV to support more; however, with the
Device Development Kit (DDK) sources, it is possible to build a new
COM driver that can support more by changing a single equate.
<P>
The Virtual Communications Device (VCD) for 386 enhanced mode can be
configured to support more than four COM ports; the extra ports are
addressable only from MS-DOS applications unless COMM.DRV is replaced.
The SYSTEM.INI MaxCOMPort= switch in the [386Enh] section can specify
a higher number. This switch assumes that the COM ports are each
addressed through separate I/O ports. There are some multiport
adapters that have all of the COM ports share a common set of I/O
ports, and then an index value is written to it that indicates which
COM port is being addressed. These multiplexed cards are not supported
by VCD.
