The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Windows for Workgroups (WFWG) provides the functionality to work with
Banyan VINES network versions 4.11(5), 5.00(5), and 5.50(1) or later.
This allows a Banyan VINES client workstation to become a Windows for
Workgroups workstation, thereby providing access to Banyan VINES
servers and/or Windows for Workgroups servers.

<P>
<P>
</UL><h2>HOW TO OBTAIN THE BANYAN VINES NDIS DRIVERS</h2>
 
<P>
To install VINES support for Windows for Workgroups, first make sure
you have the correct version of Banyan VINES drivers available either
in a directory on your hard disk or on a floppy disk.
<P>
These drivers can be obtained by ordering the appropriate Application
Note from Microsoft Product Support Services or by obtaining the drivers
from Banyan VINES.
<P>
Banyan VINES drivers for Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1
can be downloaded from the Banyan On-line Access service (BOA) at
(508) 836-1834.
<P>
The files needed to be downloaded from BOA are:
<P>
<PRE>   VINES version 4.11(5)      V4115WFW.ZIP
   VINES version 5.0(5)       V5005WFW.ZIP
   VINES version 5.5(1)       V5051WFW.ZIP


</PRE><h2>HOW TO INSTALL THE BANYAN VINES DRIVERS</h2>
 
<P>
To support Windows for Workgroups, your VINES network must be running
version 4.11(5), 5.00(5), or 5.50(1) of the network software. If your
network is running an earlier version, such as 4.10, you must first
upgrade to a more recent version. If your network is running 5.00(6),
you must first either reinstall version 5.00(5) or upgrade to 5.50(1).
<P>
The Banyan directory or the floppy disk contains the ADDNETS.EXE file,
which you need to run before you install VINES support for Windows for
Workgroups. The ADDNETS.EXE file modifies the NETWORK.INF file and
installs other network software.
<P>
Before you install VINES network support, you need to install Windows
for Workgroups. Once you've installed Windows for Workgroups, use the
following steps to install VINES support:

<OL><P><LI>If you are running Windows for Workgroups, quit and return to
   the MS-DOS command prompt.

<P><LI>Use a text editor to open your AUTOEXEC.BAT file and remove any
   VINES-specific commands (such as BAN, Z:LOGIN, and so forth).

<P><LI>Save your modified AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

<P><LI>Insert the disk in your floppy disk drive that contains the Banyan
   drivers, or change to the directory where they are located.

<P><LI>At the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following and press ENTER
<P>
<P><PRE>      &lt;drive:&gt;addnets &lt;destination&gt;
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;drive&gt; is your floppy disk drive and &lt;destination&gt; is the
   path for your Windows for Workgroups directory.
<P>
   NOTE: If Windows for Workgroups is in your PATH environment
   variable, you don't need to specify the destination. Also, if you
   are a network administrator and have installed Windows for
   Workgroups to a server by using Setup with the /A option, you can
   type the path to the shared server directory in place of the
   destination parameter to update that installation.
<P>
   The Addnets installation program modifies the NETWORK.INF file with
   VINES-specific information and installs some updated driver files
   (WFWNET.DRV and WFWSETUP.CPL).
<P>
</OL>This completes the steps that must be performed at the MS-DOS command
prompt. To add the VINES network to your list of compatible Windows
for Workgroups networks, continue with the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Start Windows for Workgroups.

<P><LI>In the Main group, choose the Control Panel icon.

<P><LI>In the Control Panel window, choose the Network icon.
<P>
   The Network Settings dialog box appears.

<P><LI>Under Options, choose the Networks button.
<P>
   The Compatible Networks dialog box appears.

<P><LI>Under Available Network Types, select either Banyan VINES 4.11(5),
   Banyan VINES 5.00(5), or Banyan VINES 5.50(1) (depending on your
   network version), and then choose the Add button.
<P>
   If the VINES files are on a disk, the VINES network software files are
   copied to your local hard disk drive from the disk. If the disk is not
   in your floppy disk drive, the system first prompts you to insert it.
   If the files are on your hard disk drive, you must direct it to the
   appropriate directory.

<P><LI>Choose the OK button to close the Compatible Networks dialog box.
<P>
   Control Panel displays a message indicating that the AUTOEXEC.BAT,
   PROTOCOL.INI, and SYSTEM.INI files have been modified. VINES-
   specific information has been added to these files. If you want to
   view them, use a text editor.

<P><LI>Choose the OK button again.

<P><LI>Remove the disk from your floppy disk drive (if any), and then
   restart your workstation.
<P>
   You must restart your workstation to make the changes take effect.
<P>
<P>
</OL><h2>CHANGES MADE BY THE BANYAN VINES DRIVERS</h2>
 
<P>
The following additions are made when Banyan VINES connectivity is
enabled in Windows for Workgroups:
<P>
<P><h2>AUTOEXEC.BAT</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>CD &lt;WFWG directory&gt;</h3>
 
<P>
The above entry may include a drive letter before the directory name,
which would cause the line to implement incorrectly. You may have to
manually change the entry from
<P>
<PRE>   CD &lt;DRIVE LETTER&gt;:&lt;WFWG DIRECTORY&gt;

   -to the following:

      &lt;drive letter&gt;:
      CD \&lt;WFWG DIRECTORY&gt;

</PRE></OL><h3>BAN /NC</h3>
 
<P>
The above entry loads the VINES software into the computer's memory
and connects the computer to a VINES network. The NC switch examines
communications hardware in the computer without initializing it.
<P>
<P><h3>NDISBAN</h3>
 
<P>
This loads the NDIS-specific portion of the VINES software.
<P>
<P><h3>REDIRALL</h3>
 
<P>
This loads support for all versions of MS-DOS.
<P>
<P><h3>ARSWAIT (Address Resolution Server Wait)</h3>
 
<P>
This entry waits until your computer has been assigned a network
address by a server. After it sees that your network has received a
network address from the network, it exits and allows your computer to
continue.
<P>
NOTE: Normally this function is built into the VINES native drivers,
but NDIS requires this functionality to be added after the NDIS driver
is loaded.
<P>
<P><h3>&lt;Z&gt;:LOGIN</h3>
 
<P>
This entry logs on to the network from the server (Z by default).
<P>
<P><h2>CONFIG.SYS</h2>

</PRE>If Microsoft LAN Manager connectivity is installed in addition to
Banyan VINES, then the following line is changed in the SYSTEM.INI
file:
<P>
[network]
<PRE>   multinet=lanman,vines500


</PRE><h2>BANYAN VINES SUPPORT FOR TOKEN RING WITH WINDOWS FOR WORKGROUPS</h2>
 
<P>
Token-Ring support for Banyan VINES drivers in Windows for Workgroups
is available directly in version 5.50(1). For support of version
4.11(5) or version 5.00(5) on a token-ring local area network (LAN)
with Windows for Workgroups, you must install a site-specific patch
for token-ring support. Patches for these versions to support token-
ring LANs are available from Banyan VINES.
<P>
To change the LAN driver in VINES version 5.50(1), do the following:

<OL><P><LI>From the Windows directory, type "pcconfig" (without the quotation
   marks) and press ENTER. This brings up a Banyan VINES menu.

<P><LI>Select NETWORK CARD SETTINGS from the menu and then press ENTER.
   This brings up a list of network cards.

<P><LI>From the network card list, select NDIS TOKEN-RING, and then press
   the F10 key twice to save your changes and exit the Banyan setup
   program.

<P><LI>Reboot your computer to make the changes take effect.
