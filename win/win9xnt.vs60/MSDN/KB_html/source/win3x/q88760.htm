The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Caere Corporation has two versions of OmniPage that are Windows 3.0, 3.0a,
and 3.1 compatible: OmniPage 386 and OmniPage Professional version 2.0.
Both versions are full-feature optical character recognition (OCR)
packages. OmniPage Professional contains two additional modules:

<UL><LI>OmniSpell (Spell checker utility)
<LI>OmniDraft (allows OmniPage to recognize dot matrix fonts)
<P>
</UL>According to OmniPage technical support, anytime you are upgrading from one
version of OmniPage to another version, you should delete the existing
version first (after saving any data files).
<P>
<P><h3>Using OmniPage 386</h3>
 
<P>
There are no known problems using OmniPage 386 with Windows 3.0 and 3.0a.
You must use OmniPage version 3.2 if you are using Windows 3.1.
<P>
<P><h3>Using OmniPage Professional Version 2.0</h3>
 
<P>
You must use OmniPage Professional version 2.0 or later if you are
running Windows 3.1. Using earlier versions causes general protection
(GP) faults during the character-recognition stage of scanning.
<P>
When you run Windows, OmniPage Professional version 2.0 may cause a general
protection (GP) fault (in Windows 3.1) or an Unrecovable Application Error
(UAE) (in Windows 3.0 and 3.0a) during a find and replace operation, if the
Find Backwards option is selected. Shortly before you receive the GP fault,
the replace operation repeats continuously.
<P>
Caere Corporation should be contacted for an upgrade if this problem
occurs.
<P>
If random problems occur while using an ATI video driver, a patch
may be required. This patch may be obtained from OmniPage technical
support.
<P>
OmniPage and OmniPage Professional are manufactured by Caere Corporation, a
vendor independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise,
regarding these products' performance or reliability.
