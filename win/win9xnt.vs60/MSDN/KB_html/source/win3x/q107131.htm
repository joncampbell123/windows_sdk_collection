The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
You can use your original Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 or
3.11 disks to create a new SYSTEM.INI file for your specific hardware and
version of the network operating system.
<P>
Creating a new SYSTEM.INI file can be useful for troubleshooting or for
replacing a damaged or deleted SYSTEM.INI file.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To create a new SYSTEM.INI file that does not contain references to third-
party device drivers but that is configured for your specific hardware, do
the following:

<OL><P><LI>Rename the SYSTEM.INI file to SYSTEM.BKP.

<P><LI>Expand the file SYSTEM.SR_ from the original Windows for Workgroups
    3.1 or 3.11 disks to your Windows directory (usually C:\WINDOWS) by
    typing the following at the MS-DOS command prompt and pressing
    ENTER:
<P>
       c:\windows\expand a:system.sr_ c:\windows\system.ini
<P>
    NOTE: For Windows for Workgroups 3.1, this file is located on Disk 3
    for both the 1.44-megabyte (MB) 3.5-inch and 1.2-MB 5.25-inch disk
    sets. For Windows for Workgroups 3.11, this file is located on Disk 2
    for both the 1.44-MB 3.5-inch and 1.2-MB 5.25-inch disk sets.

<P><LI>Change to the Windows for Workgroups drive and then change to the
    Windows directory. For example, at the MS-DOS command prompt, type
    the following, pressing ENTER after each line:
<P>
       c:
       cd \windows

<P><LI>To start the MS-DOS portion of Windows for Workgroups Setup, type
    "setup" (without the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS command prompt.

<P><LI>The options are either blank or contain some incorrect defaults
    similar to the following:
<P>
<PRE>       Keyboard:   keyboard.typ
       Codepage:   woafont.fon

    Select the correct hardware options for your system.

</PRE><P><LI>Accept the changes.
<P>
    NOTE: When you accept the changes, you are given the option to have
    Setup copy new drivers.

<P><LI>Open the new SYSTEM.INI file in a text editor, such as MS-DOS 6.0
    or 6.2 Editor. Make the following changes to the SYSTEM.INI file:
<P>
     - Add PROGMAN.EXE to the SHELL= line in the [boot] section.
<P>
     - Remove or remark out the TASKMAN.EXE= line in the [boot]
       section.
<P>
     - Add the following NETWORK.DRV= line to the [boot] section:
<P>
<PRE>          [boot]
          Network.drv=wfwnet.drv

     - For Windows for Workgroups 3.1, change the network= line in the
       [386Enh] section to the following:

          [386Enh]
          network=vnetbios.386,vnetsup.386,vredir.386,vserver.386,
          vbrowse.386,vwc.386

     - For Windows for Workgroups 3.11, change the network= line in the
       [386Enh] section to the following:

          [386Enh]
          network=*vnetbios,vnetsup.386,vredir.386,vserver.386,*vwc

       NOTE: The network= setting in the [386Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI
       file should be on one line and should not contain spaces or wrapping
       around the second line.

    - To enable 32-bit disk access, add the following lines to the
      [386Enh] section:

         32BitDiskAccess=&lt;Boolean&gt;
         device=*int13
         device=*wdctrl

      NOTE: To enable 32-bit disk access, replace &lt;Boolean&gt; with "True"
      (without the quotation marks). If you do not want 32-bit disk access
      enabled, replace &lt;Boolean&gt; with "False" (without the quotation
      marks).

      For more information about 32-bit disk access, see Appendix D in
      the Windows Resource Kit, or query on the following words in the
      Microsoft Knowledge Base:

          Windows and 3.1 and 32-bit and disk and access

</PRE><P><LI>Start Windows for Workgroups without attempting to load any network
    drivers:
<P>
    - To start Windows for Workgroups 3.1 in standard mode, type the
      following at the MS-DOS command prompt:
<P>
      win /s
<P>
      NOTE: Standard mode is not accessible in Windows for Workgroups
      3.11.
<P>
    - For Windows for Workgroups 3.11, type the following at the MS-DOS
      command prompt:
<P>
      win /n

<P><LI>In the Main group, choose Control Panel and then choose the Network
    icon.
<P>
    For Windows for Workgroups 3.11, open the SYSTEM.INI file in a text
    editor, such as Notepad.

<P><LI>Add the workgroup and computer names.
<P>
    For Windows for Workgroups 3.11, add the ComputerName= and Workgroup=
    settings in the [Network] section.

<P><LI>In Windows for Workgroups 3.1, do the following:
<P>
    - Choose the Adapters button.
<P>
    In Windows for Workgroups 3.11, do the following:
<P>
    - Choose the Network Setup icon in the Network group, then choose the
      Drivers button.

<P><LI>Add the network interface card (NIC).
<P>
    NOTE: You may need to first remove and then reinstall the NIC driver.
