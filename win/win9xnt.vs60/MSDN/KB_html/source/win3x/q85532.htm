</PRE>Introduction to Access Pack
<P>
Access Pack for Microsoft Windows makes it easier for users to control
the keyboard and mouse when using Windows versions 3.0 or 3.1.  It is
designed primarily for individuals with motion-related disabilities
who may have difficulty using the computer keyboard or mouse, and for
individuals who prefer visual feedback in place of  sounds.
<P>
Access Pack provides the following features:
<P>
<PRE>StickyKeys      allows single-fingered typing
SlowKeys        ignores keys which are pressed accidentally or for a
            short time
RepeatKeys      adjusts or disables the keyboard repeat rate
BounceKeys      ignores keys which are pressed too quickly or at the same
            time
MouseKeys       allows control of the mouse cursor using the keyboard
ToggleKeys      provides audio queues when toggle keys are turned on or off
SerialKeys      allows control of the computer using an alternate input
            device
ShowSounds      provides a visual cue when sounds are generated\177
</PRE>TimeOut  turns off the Access features when they're not being used
<P>
These features can be used separately or in combination, and can be
customized to suit the user's preference.  They are all designed so
that an individual who requires a feature can turn it on without
assistance, as long as the Access Pack is installed. When all features
are disabled, individuals who do not need them should not notice that
the Access Pack is installed.  Therefore, a computer on which Access
Pack is installed can be used both by individuals who require it and
those who do not.
<P>
It is recommended that Access Pack be installed on all computers which
may be used by multiple people, such as public or workgroup machines.
<P>
The Access Pack software is fully compatible with most hardware
configurations.  Access Pack consists of three keyboard drivers and a
mouse driver, which replace the standard Windows drivers which are
used on most hardware. It also includes the Access Utility
(ACCESS.EXE), a program that controls the Access function, and a few
other files which the Access Utility uses.
<P>
Installation of Access Pack software
<P>
To install Access Pack by hand

<OL><P><LI>Exit Windows to return to the MS-DOS prompt.

<P><LI>Open the SYSTEM.INI file by using a text editor.

<P><LI>Find the section labeled [boot].

<P><LI>In the [boot] section, find the entry labeled "keyboard.drv=".

<P><LI>The following entries indicate that you are already running an
   older version of the Access Pack keyboard driver:
<P>
<PRE>            keyboard.drv=ap-kbd.drv
            keyboard.drv=ap-kbdhp.drv
            keyboard.drv=ap-kbdol.drv

   If the entry in the [boot] section of your SYSTEM.INI file
   matches any of these, you need to copy the newer version of
   the corresponding .drv file to the Windows SYSTEM directory.
   For example, if the Access Pack software is located on a
   floppy disk in your A: drive, and your SYSTEM.INI file reads
   "keyboard.drv=ap- kbd.drv", and Windows is installed in the
   WINDOWS directory on drive C:, then you should type the
   following command at the MS-DOS prompt:

            copy a:ap-kbd.drv c:\windows\system

   The following entries indicate that you are running a keyboard
   driver compatible with a corresponding Access keyboard driver,

   If your entry says:         change the entry to:     and   copy file:
   keyboard.drv=keyboard.drv   keyboard.drv=ap-kbd.drv        ap-kbd.drv
   keyboard.drv=kbdhp.drv      keyboard.drv=ap-kbdhp.drv      ap-kbdhp.drv
   keyboard.drv=kbdoli.drv     keyboard.drv=ap-kbdol.drv      ap-kbdol.drv

   Instructions for copying the appropriate file to the Windows
   SYSTEM directory are explained in the preceding paragraph.

   If your entry does not match any of those listed here, then
   your computer may not be compatible with the Access Pack
   software.  Contact your computer manufacturer to find out if
   your computer can be used with any of the Access Pack keyboard
   drivers.

</PRE><P><LI>In the [boot] section, find the entry labeled "mouse.drv=".
<P>
   If the entry says "mouse.drv=ap-mou.drv" then you are already
   running an older version of the Access Pack mouse driver.  You
   need to copy the newer version of the AP-MOU.DRV file to your
   Windows SYSTEM directory.
<P>
   If the entry says "mouse.drv=mouse.drv" then you are running
   standard keyboard drivers which can be replaced with the
   corresponding Access driver. Copy the file AP-MOU.DRV to your
   Windows SYSTEM directory, and edit the entry in SYSTEM.INI to
   say "mouse.drv=ap-mou.drv".
<P>
   If your entry does not match any of those listed here, contact
   your mouse manufacturer to find out if your mouse is
   compatible with the Microsoft mouse driver, or if the
   manufacturer has an Access driver available.
<P>
   If you cannot install an Access mouse driver, you will not be
   able to use the Access Pack MouseKeys feature or control the
   mouse using the SerialKeys feature, but you will still be able
   to use the keyboard-related features.

<P><LI>Copy the following files from the Access Pack into your Windows
   directory:
<P>
<PRE>            ACCESS.EXE
            ACCESS.WRI
            ACCESS31.HLP
            ACCESSU.DLL
            IBMMKEYS.BMP
            SKWIN.BMP

   For example, if the Access Pack software is on a floppy disk
   in drive A: and Windows is installed in the WINDOWS directory
   on drive C:, then you should type the following commands at
   the MS-DOS prompt:

            copy a:access.exe       c:\windows
            copy a:access.wri       c:\windows
            copy a:access31.hlp     c:\windows
            copy a:accessu.dll      c:\windows
            copy a:ibmmkeys.bmp     c:\windows
            copy a:skwin.bmp        c:\windows

   Note: If you are running Microsoft Windows version 3.0, you
   should copy the file ACCESS30.HLP instead of ACCESS31.HLP.

</PRE><P><LI>Start Windows, and then create a program item for the file
   ACCESS.EXE.
<P>
   For more information about creating program items, see Chapter 3,
   "Program Manager," in the "Microsoft Windows User's Guide."
<P>
</OL>Automatic Startup of the Access Utility
<P>
Once Windows has been configured to use the Access Pack keyboard
driver, the Access features can be activated whenever Windows is
running. The individual features can be enabled or disabled, or
customized to fit the your preferences, using the Access Utility
(ACCESS.EXE).
<P>
The Access Utility can be started at any time to adjust these options.
Instructions for starting applications are described in Chapter 2,
"Application Basics", in the Windows 3.1 Windows User's Guide (or
Chapter 2, ""Basic Skills" in the Windows 3.0 Windows User's Guide).
<P>
If you would like to have the Access Utility running at all times, you
may have it started automatically every time you start Windows.
<P>
If you are running Windows 3.1, you should add a program item for the
Access Utility to the "StartUp" program group in Program Manager.
For detailed instructions, see Chapter 3, "Program Manager", in the
Windows 3.1 Windows User's Guide.
<P>
If you are running Windows 3.0, you must edit a file called  WIN.INI.
To edit the WIN.INI file, you must have a word processor or text
editor that has the ability to read, write and save a "text" or
"ASCII" file. The WIN.INI file should be in the Windows directory
(for example, c:\windows). The second or third line in the WIN.INI
file contains the instruction "load = ". If a program name or some
command appears after the "load = " instruction, just append the
Access Utility onto the line by leaving a blank space and then type
"access.exe" (without the quotation marks). For example, to have the Access
Utility and the Windows clock program start up as icons each time you
start Windows, change the WIN.INI load line to read as follows:
<P>
<PRE>        load = clock.exe access.exe

</PRE></OL>If you would rather have the Access Utility start as an open window,
append it to the next line of the WIN.INI file, which has the
instruction "run = ".
<P>
Non-Windows Applications' Use of Access Features
<P>
The Disability Access Features StickyKeys, RepeatKeys, SlowKeys,
BounceKeys, MouseKeys, ShowSounds, ToggleKeys, and TimeOut will only
function for Windows Applications. If you need similar access features
in non-Windows applications, you will need to use other programs.
Some of these other programs include Terminate and Stay Resident (TSR)
programs such as AccessDOS. AccessDOS includes all of the above
disability access features for DOS users and is available FREE from
IBM (800) 426-7282.\177
<P>
The StickyKeys Feature
<P>
StickyKeys is a feature that allows people who must type with 1
finger, a mouthstick or a headstick to be able to use modifier keys
(SHIFT, CTRL, and ALT keys).  With StickyKeys turned on, a person can
press a modifier key and then another key in sequence rather than at
the same time, to get shifted (modified) characters.  To turn
StickyKeys on from the keyboard, tap either shift key five times
(without disturbing the mouse).  If you have the sound features of
StickyKeys enabled, you will hear an up-siren tone. To turn off
StickyKeys off from the keyboard, tap a shift key five times (you will
hear a down-siren if the sound feature is enabled).  StickyKeys can
also be turned on or off from the StickyKeys dialog box under the
"Adjust" menu.
<P>
StickyKeys operates in two modes: key latching mode and key locking
mode.  Tapping ONCE on a modifier key causes it to go into LATCHED
mode.  If you have the sound features of StickyKeys enabled, a short
low beep - high beep will be heard.  As soon as the next non-modifier
key is pressed the modifier key(s) will be released. Tapping TWICE in
succession on a modifier key will put it into LOCKED mode.  If you
have the sound features of StickyKeys enabled, you will hear a short
low - high beep after the first tap and a single high beep after the
second tap.  Once a modifier key is LOCKED, it will stay "locked down"
until that modifier key is hit a third time.  Any and all of the
modifier keys (SHIFT, CTRL, and ALT) can be latched or locked in
combination.
<P>
For shared or public use computers, there is an optional "Turn off
when pressing Two keys at once" feature to keep non-disabled users
from being confused if StickyKeys is accidentally left on.  Whenever
an able-bodied typist uses a keyboard, they will hold the modifier key
down and strike another key simultaneously.  If the "Turn off when
pressing Two keys at once" shutoff feature is enabled, StickyKeys will
detect that two keys are down simultaneously and automatically turn
the StickyKeys feature off.
<P>
Some people do not like to have keyboard sounds while others find them
useful.  The ability to turn the different feedback sounds on or off
is provided in the StickyKeys dialog box under the "Adjust" menu.
Also, it is possible to disable the LOCKED mode of StickyKeys
described above if it is not desired.
<P>
On United States keyboards or when using "United States" as your
country and keyboard layout, StickyKeys treats the modifier keys as
identical pairs.  In other words, StickyKeys will treat the left and
right shift (SHIFT), the left and right control (CTRL), and the left
and right alternate (ALT) keys the same.  Treating the modifier keys
as identical pairs allows the user greater flexibility.  For example,
if the user entered LOCKED mode by tapping the left shift key twice,
they could perform their intended function and exit LOCKED mode by
tapping the right shift key once, since the two modifier keys are
treated the same.
<P>
On non United States keyboards or when not using "United States" as
your country or keyboard layout, you may find that your particular
international keyboard attempts to distinguish between the left and
right modifier keys.  In particular, your international keyboard may
need to distinguish between the left and right alternate (ALT) keys.
This is typically done by giving the right alternate key a new name,
instead of just "Alt", it is now called the "AltGr" key.  "AltGr" is
an abbreviation for "alt-graphics". For international keyboard
layouts, StickyKeys will still allow the user to move freely between
the left and right shift (SHIFT) or control (CTRL) keys, but you will
notice a difference in the behavior of the left and right alternate
(ALT) keys.  The left alternate key will behave as the standard "Alt"
key, typically used to quickly access a menu item, while the right
alternate key will behave as the "AltGr" key, which many international
keyboards use to access special characters important to their
individual languages. Both the "Alt" and the "AltGr" keys can still be
used in either LATCHED or LOCKED mode.
<P>
The Keyboard Response Features
<P>
The Keyboard Response group is a set of functions that modify how the
individual keys on the keyboard behave or respond when you press them.
If the standard key-repeat feature of your keyboard is too fast, or
you don't want it at all, RepeatKeys allows you to slow it down or
turn it off.  If you bump keys accidentally as you move around on the
keyboard and would like to slow the keyboard response down so that it
would only accept keys after they have been held down for awhile,
SlowKeys will do this for you.  If you have a tremor and accidentally
type keys twice as you press or release them, BounceKeys can be used
to make the computer ignore the extra tap on the keyboard.
<P>
The three functions under Keyboard Response, RepeatKeys, SlowKeys, and
BounceKeys, are enabled and disabled together as a group.  This is
done to simplify turning the group on and off from the keyboard.  Most
people are only interested in using one or two of the functions in the
group.  This is not a problem.  You can individually adjust the
functions within this group such that when enabled, unwanted functions
will have no effect.
<P>
There are two adjustments for the RepeatKeys function.  The first
setting, "Repeat Rate", allows you to adjust the speed at which the
keys will repeat when you hold a key down. The smaller numbers (like
0.3) will make keys repeat faster.  If you do not want the keys to
repeat at all, then just set the Repeat Rate to OFF.  If the Repeat
Rate is set to OFF, the Delay until Repeat scroll bar will be
disabled.  To re-enable the Delay until Repeat, you must select a
Repeat Rate other than OFF.
<P>
The second setting, "Delay until Repeat", allows you to set the length
of time you must hold a key down before it will begin to repeat.  If
you have trouble releasing a key in time, then set this to a higher or
longer setting.
<P>
(NOTE: For RepeatKeys to work within Windows 3.0, you must adjust the
Control Panel keyboard setting for "Repeat Rate", a sliding bar, all
the way to the left for "slow".  For RepeatKeys to work within Windows
3.1, you must adjust the Control Panel keyboard setting for "Repeat
Rate", a sliding bar, all the way to the left for "slow", and the
keyboard setting for "Delay Before First Repeat", another sliding bar,
all the way to the right for "short".)
<P>
SlowKeys allows you to slow down the keyboard so that keys must be
held down for a while before they will be accepted by the computer.
This is useful for individuals who could use the keyboard but
accidentally bump extra keys when they try to type.  By slowing down
the response of the keyboard, these extra key bumps are ignored and
only the keys that are typed and held down are accepted.  SlowKeys
only has one setting called "Acceptance Delay".  Acceptance Delay
allows you to adjust the amount of time that you must hold a key down
before it will be accepted by the computer.  If you do not want the
SlowKeys function to be active, then just set the Acceptance Delay to
OFF.
<P>
Individuals who tremor or have impaired control of their hands may
find that they type two or more of the same letter when they type.
They bounce on the same key either when they are pressing it or when
they release it, causing extra characters. BounceKeys allows the
computer to ignore these quick bounces on the same key, so that only
one key is accepted.  There is only one setting for BounceKeys,
"Debounce Time". The larger the time setting, the longer you will have
to wait after you release a key before you can type the same key a
second time (up to 2 seconds!).  If you do not want the BounceKeys
function, then just set the Debounce Time to OFF.  When BounceKeys is
on, if you want to type the same key twice you just need to pause a
bit between the two key presses. BounceKeys does not prevent you from
typing other keys quickly.
<P>
BounceKeys and SlowKeys cannot be used or both be active (turned on)
at the same time. This may seem confusing, but if you have SlowKeys on
(e.g. acceptance delay does not equal OFF), it will provide a
BounceKeys like function on both the hit and release of each key.
While SlowKeys would assist some individuals, it would hinder others
since they may only tremor or bounce when they release a key.
Therefore, these individuals would only want to have BounceKeys
active.
<P>
Once you have set up the desired values under Keyboard Response
(RepeatKeys, SlowKeys and BounceKeys), you need to enable group.  If
the Keyboard Response dialog box is open (e.g. under "Adjust" menu),
then select ON at the top of the dialog box.  This will turn on any of
the Keyboard Response  functions which you selected.
<P>
Sometimes you may want to enable or disable the Keyboard Response
functions from the keyboard without having to open the dialog box.  To
do this just hold the right shift key down for 8 seconds.  After about
4 seconds you will hear 3 short warning beeps.  (These are provided
just in case someone is accidentally resting their hand on the right
shift key and doesn't really want to enable these functions - it's
sort of a "get off the key" warning). Since you do want these
functions enabled, just ignore these warning beeps and keep holding
the key down.  After about 4 seconds more you will hear an up-siren
(e.g. provided Sound when turned on or off is enabled).  You can
release the right shift key now and the Keyboard Response functions
will be enabled using the values you set for RepeatKeys, SlowKeys and
BounceKeys.  You can disable the Keyboard Response group from the
keyboard using this same procedure.  When you disable the group you
will hear a down-siren (e.g. provided Sound when turned on or off is
enabled).
<P>
Some individuals are completely unable to operate the computer unless
they can turn the keyboard repeat function off and/or turn SlowKeys
on.  These individuals could find themselves in a Catch-22, unable to
use the computer to turn on the functions they need to operate the
computer.  There is a solution to this problem built into the Access
Utility. There is an emergency enabling routine that allows you to
turn the Keyboard Response functions on using only one key on the
keyboard.  To enable the emergency settings for Keyboard Response from
the keyboard, you just hold down the right shift key (as you normally
do to enable the Keyboard Response) except that you keep holding it
down even after you hear the first up-siren.  If you hold the right
shift key down long enough, this is the sequence of events that will
happen: after 4 seconds, 3 short warning beeps; after 4 more seconds,
a single up-siren indicating that Keyboard Response has turned on with
the settings you previously chose with the dialog box open or with the
default settings; after 4 more seconds, you will hear 2 up-sirens
which is the first level of emergency settings, RepeatKeys will have
the Repeat Rate OFF (no key repeats), SlowKeys will be OFF, (no
acceptance delay), and BounceKeys will have a Debounce Time of 1
second; after 4 more seconds (total of about 16 seconds), you will
hear 3 up-sirens which is the second level of emergency settings,
RepeatKeys will have the Repeat Rate OFF, SlowKeys will have the
acceptance delay set to maximum or 2 seconds, and BounceKeys will be
OFF.  If an individual activates either of the two emergency settings,
they should then open the Keyboard Response dialog box and change the
settings to the values they need to operate the computer keyboard.
After these changes have been made and saved, the user should exit the
emergency settings (hold right shift key down for 8 seconds until the
down-siren) and then re-activate Keyboard Response (hold right shift
key down for 8 seconds until the up-siren).  The Keyboard Response
functions would then be turned on with the individuals newly saved
settings.
<P>
Another very useful feature in the Keyboard Response functions is the
setting called "Click when a key is Pressed".  If this setting is
checked and any of the Keyboard Response functions are active, you
will hear a click when you press the key, or when the key repeats.
For example, if SlowKeys is active, you would hear a key "click" sound
when the key is pressed and also when the computer accepts the key.
You may just wish to have a key "click" sound with every key you press
while not using the Keyboard Response functions.  To do this, set
SlowKeys and BounceKeys to OFF, adjust RepeatKeys to your needs, and
then turn on the Keyboard Response group.  The "Click when a key is
Pressed" feature provides additional user feedback.  This can be very
important when the keyboard has been modified to function or "respond"
differently then the expected norm.
<P>
The MouseKeys Feature
<P>
Some users do not have the physical control to operate a pointing
device such as the mouse, yet need to access software which requires
them to use the pointing device. MouseKeys provides a means to control
the mouse cursor on the screen by using the numeric keypad on the
keyboard.  You turn MouseKeys on or off by simultaneously pressing the
left ALT key, the left SHIFT key and the NUM LOCK key.  When MouseKeys
turns on, you will hear an up-siren if you have sounds enabled.  (If
you are using only one finger, a mouthstick, or a headpointer to
operate the computer, the easiest way to activate MouseKeys is to
first activate StickyKeys by tapping either SHIFT key 5 times.  You
can then hit the three keys in sequence rather than simultaneously.)
Once MouseKeys is turned on, the numeric keypad becomes a mouse
control pad. Each key on the keypad performs a different mouse
function.  The "5, +, 0, and ." keys operate the buttons on the mouse.
Use the "5" key when you want to click a mouse button once.  To
<PRE>double-click a mouse button, use the "+" key.   When you want to hold
</PRE>a mouse button down while you use the mouse (as for dragging), press
the "0" key to lock the mouse button down and the "." key to release
the mouse button.  On 101-key keyboards, the "/" makes the left mouse
button the currently active button, the "-" makes the right mouse
button the currently active button, and the "*" makes both mouse
buttons the currently active button.  On older keyboard with fewer
keys, it may not be possible to make both mouse buttons active.  The
keys "1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9" are used to move the mouse cursor
around the screen in the directions suggested by their location on the
numeric keypad.  For example, pressing the "1" key will move the mouse
cursor down and to the left while pressing the "8" key will move the
mouse cursor straight upward on the screen. Holding a direction key
down will cause the mouse cursor to continue to move in the respective
direction, slowly at first, and then increasing to the maximum speed.
The mouse pointer will then continue at maximum speed until the key is
released.  Both the maximum speed of the mouse cursor and the time it
takes to get to maximum speed are adjustable in the MouseKeys dialog
box under the "Adjust" menu.

(NOTE:  If SlowKeys is active, all the MouseKey control keys will
respond according to the amount of "Acceptance Delay" selected.)
<P>
While MouseKeys is on, you can use the NUM LOCK key to toggle the
MouseKeys control pad back to a numeric keypad and vice versa.  This
feature is especially useful if you are using a laptop or notebook
computer which doesn't have a separate numeric keypad.  On these
computer keyboards, the numeric keypad is usually overlaid on top of
the standard "qwerty" keyboard.  Tapping once on the NUM LOCK key to
toggle between either a numeric keypad or a mouse control pad makes it
very convenient for the user.  When toggling between a mouse control
pad and the numeric keypad, the numeric keypad will be in the state it
was in before MouseKeys was started. For example, if you were using
the numeric keypad for number entry before starting MouseKeys, when
you toggle out of MouseKeys with the NUM LOCK key, you will be able to
enter numbers with the numeric keypad.  If you were using the numeric
keypad as a cursor keypad before starting MouseKeys, when you toggle
out of MouseKeys using the NUM LOCK key, you will have a cursor
keypad.  MouseKeys will work in Windows 3.0 and Windows 3.1 in
conjunction with the standard Microsoft or IBM PS/2 mouse.  You can
use the standard mouse to move quickly about the screen and then use
MouseKeys to move more precisely (unit by unit) to your final
destination.  Some people cannot use the standard mouse while
simultaneously holding down the mouse button.  You can use MouseKeys
to lock down the currently active mouse button, move the mouse cursor
using MouseKeys or the real mouse, and then release the mouse button
using MouseKeys.
<P>
Note:  This version of the Access Utility (3.0.a) does not require the
user to have a Microsoft or PS/2 mouse connected to the computer in
order for MouseKeys to work while running Windows.

The ToggleKeys Feature
<P>
People with visual impairments may not be able to see the lights on
the keyboard that indicate CAPS LOCK, NUM LOCK and SCROLL LOCK status.
ToggleKeys provides a solution to this by emitting a tone whenever
these keys are pressed. If ToggleKeys is enabled, when you press one
of these keys and it turns on, you will hear a high beep. When you
press one of these keys and it turns off, you will hear a low beep.
ToggleKeys is turned on from the keyboard by pressing the NUM LOCK key
and holding it down for about 5 seconds.  When ToggleKeys turns on,
you will hear an up-siren if sound is enabled.  You turn ToggleKeys
off from the keyboard the same way, just hold the NUM LOCK key for
about 5 seconds and you will hear a down-siren. ToggleKeys can also be
turned on or off from the ToggleKeys dialog box under the "Adjust"
menu.  ToggleKeys will also function with some keyboards which do not
have the status indicator lights for the CAPS LOCK, NUM LOCK and
SCROLL LOCK keys.  The audible low and high beeps can be very useful
for all operators when using this style of keyboard.
