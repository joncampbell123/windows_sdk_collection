<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Windows may encounter some problems when running on a computer system
configured with an Intel 386 SnapIn. The following are some of the
most common situations:

<UL><LI>Windows returns to the command line after trying to load.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>The error message "Cannot file or load specific file" is received.
<P>
   -or-

<LI> Windows cannot be run in enhanced mode.
<P>
</UL>This information applies to Microsoft MS-DOS version 5.0 and Windows
versions 3.0 and 3.0a.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If Windows is having a problem operating on a system equipped with an
Intel SnapIn 386, check the following:

<OL><P><LI>Make sure Windows has been reinstalled after SnapIn 386 was added
   to the system. This makes sure the 386 specific files necessary for
   enhanced mode operation are copied to the hard drive. NOTE: This
   case alone is the most common cause for the error message "Cannot
   file or load specific file."

<P><LI>Add VirtualHDIRQ=off to the 386ENH section of the SYSTEM.INI
   file. This will enable certain hard disk controller interrupts to
   go through the ROM routine that handles those interrupts, instead
   of being controlled by Windows when running in enhanced mode.

<P><LI>If SMARTDRV.SYS is loading, add the parameter /b+ to the end of the
   SMARTDRV.SYS command line in the CONFIG.SYS file. The /b+ parameter
   forces the double buffering capability of the SMARTDRV.SYS disk
   cache to be installed. The line would look similar to the following
   example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      DEVICE=[drive:][path]\SMARTDRV.SYS 1024 512 /B+
</PRE><P>
   Warning: It is also possible to use the /b- parameter, which
   disables the double buffering capabilities of SMARTDRV.SYS.
   However, if there is a Bus Master board present in the system and
   the /b- parameter is used, Data corruption may occur.

<P><LI>Check for memory conflicts. If there are expansion boards in the
   system that occupy memory address space (network boards, emulation
   boards, and so on), add an EMMEXCLUDE= statement to the 386ENH
   section of the SYSTEM.INI file. Exclude the range to cover the
   memory address of the expansion board. The line would look similar
   to the following example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      EMMEXCLUDE=A000-EFFF
</PRE><P>
</OL>NOTE: On an Intel SnapIn 386 equipped system running MS-DOS 5.0,
SMARTDRV.SYS looks at the system ID byte and sees a 286. It then
assumes that Windows cannot be run in enhanced mode. Because SnapIn
386 allows these systems to run in 386 enhanced mode, you must make
the adjustments above to ensure stable operation.
