The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11
</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Some Gateway computers ship with the AnyKey programmable keyboard. On such
systems, the keyboard repeat rate may be extremely slow, or you may
accidentally program the keyboard to do something that you do not intend.
In this situation, symptoms may indicate you have a problem with either
Microsoft MS-DOS or Windows when this is not the case. To identify the
AnyKey keyboard, locate a key labeled "Program" in the upper-right corner
of the keyboard.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following information may help you work around problems with the AnyKey
keyboard.
<P>
<P><h3>Slow Keyboard Repeat Rate</h3>
 
<P>
The AnyKey programmable keyboard allows you to select the rate at which
keys repeat when you hold down the keys. This setting overrides any setting
made using the DOS MODE command or Windows Control Panel. You may choose
any one of eight different rates, ranging from 2 characters per second
(CPS) to 30 characters per second.
<P>
To set the repeat rate:

<OL><P><LI>Press the Repeat Rate Key (found in the upper-right corner of the
   keyboard). The Program LED should begin to flash.

<P><LI>Function keys F1 through F8 produce the following repeat rates:
<P>
<PRE>       F1    2  CPS
       F2    3  CPS
       F3    5  CPS
       F4    7  CPS
       F5   10  CPS
       F6   15  CPS
       F7   20  CPS
       F8   30  CPS

</PRE><P><LI>Press the function key that produces the rate you want, then press the
   Repeat Rate key again. The Program LED stops flashing and the new
   repeat rate is set.
<P>
</OL><h3>Keyboard is Programmed Incorrectly</h3>
 
<P>
To reset the keyboard to its default state:

<OL><P><LI>Ensure the NUM LOCK, CAPS LOCK, and SCROLL LOCK LEDs are off. If these
   keys are remapped (that is, they do not respond), skip this step and
   continue with step 2.

<P><LI>Press the CTRL+ALT+Suspend Macro key combination. (The Suspend Macro
   key is in the upper-right corner of the keyboard.)
<P>
</OL>The Program light on the keyboard flashes momentarily, indicating that the
keyboard has been reset. If the keyboard hangs (stops responding) after
performing the above steps, unplug the keyboard from the central processing
unit (CPU), then plug it in again or restart the computer.
<P>
If the computer is running Windows, the reset may fail. If this happens,
exit completely out of Windows to the MS-DOS prompt, and repeat the reset
instructions.
<P>
The AnyKey keyboard is manufactured by Gateway, a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this
product's performance or reliability.
