The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The following error message may appear when you attempt to share an
otherwise properly configured local CD-ROM drive while using Windows for
Workgroups (WFWG):
<P>
<PRE>   You can only share resources that are on your computer. If you are
   trying to share a printer, make sure that it is a local printer and
   that the TEMP directory is on a local drive.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This error may occur if the drive designator (letter) assigned to the
CD-ROM device was previously assigned to a remote resource on the
network.
<P>
Windows for Workgroups running in enhanced mode provides the ability
to share local disks (including CD-ROMs) and printer resources with
other users on the network. If the local drive letter assigned to the
CD-ROM has also been assigned to a remote disk resource, by using the
File Manager or a NET USE command, File Manager still displays the
CD-ROM and its contents for that drive letter. However, attempts to
share the CD-ROM results in the above error message.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
There are three workarounds to eliminate this problem, depending on
the configuration involved and the intended result. Use one of the
following methods:

<UL><LI>From the MS-DOS Prompt INSIDE of Windows for Workgroups, type:
<P>
<P><PRE>      net use &lt;x&gt;: /d
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;x&gt; is the drive letter in conflict between the remote
   resource and the CD-ROM.
<P>
</UL>-or-

<UL><LI>From the Windows for Workgroups directory MS-DOS command prompt
   OUTSIDE of Windows, delete the CONNECT.DAT file.
<P>
   NOTE: This removes ALL persistent network connections. You will
   need to manually re-establish all non-conflicting connections
   during your next Windows for Workgroups session.
<P>
</UL>-or-

<UL><LI>Use the MSCDEX /L:&lt;letter&gt; option to change the drive letter assigned
   to the CD-ROM to that of an available, unassigned drive letter. MSCDEX
   is typically loaded with AUTOEXEC.BAT. Note that the /S parameter is
   also required to share the CD-ROM. Type "mscdex" (without the quotation
   marks) at the MS-DOS command prompt outside of Windows for Workgroups
   for a list of available MSCDEX options.
