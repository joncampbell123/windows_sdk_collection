The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Windows for Workgroups 3.11 may not install properly when you use the SETUP
/N command from a shared copy that is located on a Microsoft LAN Manager-
or Windows NT-based server. This article explains how to correctly set up a
shared copy of Windows for Workgroups on a LAN Manager-based network.
<P>
Please note that when Windows for Workgroups is set up this way, Windows
for Workgroups server capabilities are not available because users must
start the real-mode network redirector to access the shared files on the
server. The Windows for Workgroups server cannot run when the real-mode
redirector is started. This behavior is different from that of Windows for
Workgroups 3.1 (because of changes made in 3.11 to facilitate use of the
Installable File System [IFS] Manager).
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Users wanting to set up a shared copy of Windows for Workgroups must first
have a real-mode networking client installed that is able to connect to the
file server where the shared copy of Windows for Workgroups had been
installed. This article describes how to set up Windows for Workgroups with
either Workgroups Connections 1.0 or the Microsoft LAN Manager client,
which is included in the Microsoft Network client. This article assumes
that SETUP /A has already been completed and the shared files are already
located on the file server.
<P>
<P><h3>Workgroup Connections</h3>
 
<P>
Workgroup Connections is a real-mode networking client that is normally
used to connect to Windows for Workgroups servers. Use the following steps
to set up a shared copy of Windows for Workgroups with Workgroup
Connections:
<P>
1.Install Workgroup Connections in a clean directory. The Setup program
<PRE>  defaults to the DOS directory; do NOT install to this directory. If you
  do so, you install Windows for Workgroups user files over the top of this
  directory.

</PRE>2.Use the Workgroup Connections network to connect to the file server's
<PRE>  Windows for Workgroups share with drive &lt;W&gt;. (It does not matter which
  drive you use, but you must remember the drive letter because the same
  drive must be used after Windows for Workgroups has been set up.)

</PRE>3.Run the Windows for Workgroups SETUP /N command and let Windows for
<PRE>  Workgroups install to the same directory in which you installed
  Workgroup Connections. Setup should automatically choose the Microsoft
  Windows Network, and you should verify that your network card driver is
  set up properly. Be sure to let Setup configure your CONFIG.SYS and
  AUTOEXEC.BAT files.

</PRE>4.Once Setup is complete, reboot the machine. The real-mode network should
<PRE>  start and log you on to the network. Use the NET USE command to connect
  drive &lt;W&gt; to the file server's Windows for Workgroups share. (This drive
  letter should be the same one you used in step 2.)

</PRE>5.Use the WIN command to start Windows for Workgroups. The first time you
<PRE>  start Windows for Workgroups, a warning message states that you do not
  have sharing capabilities (because the real-mode network is started).
  You can ignore this message and choose the NO button to prevent it from
  coming up again.

</PRE><h3>Microsoft Network Client (LAN Manager Client)</h3>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Network Client is a real-mode LAN Manager client that is
available for download from the Microsoft Download Service (MSDL), and the
Internet server (type "GOWINNT ! AdvSys\MSClient" [without the quotation
marks]). If you can't access these services, the Microsoft Network client
is available for sale from Microsoft Sales and Service at (800) 426-9400.
Use the following steps to set up a shared copy of Windows for Workgroups
with the LAN Manager client:
<P>
1.Use the LAN Manager client to connect to the file server's Windows for
<PRE>  Workgroups share with drive &lt;W&gt;. (It doesn't matter which drive you use,
  but you must remember the drive letter because the same drive must be
  used after Windows for Workgroups has been set up.)

</PRE>2.Run the Windows for Workgroups SETUP /N command and direct Windows for
<PRE>  Workgroups to a clean directory. Do not set up Windows for Workgroups in
  the directory that LAN Manager is in. (If you do, the PROTOCOL.INI file
  is not set up correctly.) Setup should automatically choose the
  Microsoft Windows Network, and you should verify that your network card
  driver is set up properly. Be sure to let Setup configure your
  CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files, and make sure that all references to
  LAN Manager are removed from both files.

</PRE>3.Once Setup is complete, reboot the machine. The real-mode network should
<PRE>  start and log you on to the network. Use the NET USE command to connect
  drive &lt;W&gt; to the file server's Windows for Workgroups share. This drive
  letter should be the same drive letter you used in step 1.

</PRE>4.Use the WIN command to start Windows for Workgroups. The first time you
<PRE>  start Windows for Workgroups, a warning message states you do not have
  sharing capabilities (because the real-mode network is started). You can
  ignore this message and choose the NO button to prevent it from coming
  up again.
