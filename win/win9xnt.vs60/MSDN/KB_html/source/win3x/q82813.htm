The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
With Windows version 3.1, OLE clients look for a server application (that
is, the application associated with the object) in the following order:

<OL><P><LI>The location specified in the REG.DAT file.
</OL>2. The WIN.INI file.
3. The WINDOWS directory.
4. The WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory.
5. The location specified in the MS-DOS PATH environment variable
<PRE>   (which is specified in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file).

</PRE></OL>A correct path in any of the above locations is sufficient to start
the server application. If the server application is moved, then do
any one of the following:

<UL><LI>Locate the application's *.REG file and issue the following
   command:
<P>
<P><PRE>     REGEDIT /S &lt;FILENAME&gt;.REG
</PRE>
<LI>Make sure the server's location is specified in the MS-DOS PATH
   environment variable.

<LI>Reinstall the application to update the REG.DAT file.

<LI>Make sure that the server is in the WINDOWS or WINDOWS\SYSTEM
   directory.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If the server application is not found in the location specified in
the REG.DAT file, the path specified in REG.DAT is ignored and the
client looks in the next location.
<P>
The "synching" properties of the registration file makes it so that it
looks in the [Embedding] section of the WIN.INI. For example, if you
install Microsoft Excel 3.0 (not 4.0), then the application writes its
OLE information to the WIN.INI [Embedding] section.  The first time
that you use OLE in Excel, it looks in the REG.DAT file, doesn't find
anything about Excel, then looks in the [Embedding] section of the
WIN.INI, finds the information, updates the REG.DAT, and then launches
the program.
<P>
If the client doesn't locate the information in the WIN.INI, it looks
in the next location (the WINDOWS directory). The REG.DAT and WIN.INI
files are not changed to remove the incorrect location. Therefore, the
identical search pattern is used the next time the OLE libraries
request the location of this particular server application. (The
entries in the [Embedding] section of the WIN.INI file are not used by
the OLE libraries because SHELL.DLL keeps the REG.DAT file and the
WIN.INI [Embedding] section identical.)
<P>
If the client still doesn't locate the information, it looks in the
WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory, and then in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file.
<P>
If Windows is unable to find the server application in any of the
above locations, the following error message is displayed when the
client requests the server's services:
<P>
<PRE>   The server application cannot be found.

   Make sure that the application is properly
   installed, or exists in your DOS path, and that it
   has not been deleted, moved, or renamed.
