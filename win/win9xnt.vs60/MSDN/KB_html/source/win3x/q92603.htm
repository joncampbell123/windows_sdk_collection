The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
A "clean boot" (starting your computer after all unnecessary commands
have been removed from your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files) is used
as a basic troubleshooting step to test possible conflicts between
Windows for Workgroups 3.1 and various terminate-and-stay-resident
(TSR) programs and device drivers. There are different types of clean
boots; the correct one to use depends on whether or not Windows for
Workgroups has been installed.
<P>
NOTE: This article explains how to clean boot your system up to the point
when you start Windows. To start Windows without loading any third-party
programs, you must clear the StartUp group, clear the LOAD= and RUN=
entries in the WIN.INI file, and ensure the SHELL= entry in the SYSTEM.INI
file is loading PROGMAN.EXE. Also, make sure the SYSTEM.INI file does not
include third-party virtual device drivers (VxDs) or other third-party
Windows components.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Before Clean Booting</h3>
 
<P>
Create a bootable floppy disk that contains the MS-DOS system files
and any other files that are required to make the system operational,
such as disk-compression utilities (for example, Stacker), disk-
partitioning drivers (for example, Disk Manager), and other
third-party device drivers.
<P>
<P><h3>To Clean Boot Before Running Windows for Workgroups Setup</h3>
 
<P>
If you are not using any disk-compression software, disk-partitioning
software, or other third-party drivers necessary to boot the computer,
the machine can be booted on a floppy disk that contains only the
MS-DOS system files, without a CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT file.
<P>
If there is disk-partitioning, disk-compression, or other third-party
software required to boot the computer, the startup files on the disk
created above should appear as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   CONFIG.SYS                              AUTOEXEC.BAT
   ----------------------------------------------------

   FILES=45                                PROMPT $P$G
   BUFFERS=20
   &lt;Third-party disk-partitioning driver &gt;
   &lt;Third-party disk-compression driver&gt;
   &lt;Other required third-party driver&gt;

</PRE>After Windows for Workgroups 3.1 is installed with Novell NetWare as
a second network, a clean boot should appear as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   CONFIG.SYS                                    AUTOEXEC.BAT
   ----------------------------------------------------------

   FILES=45                                      &lt;valid path&gt;NET START
   BUFFERS=20                                    &lt;valid path&gt;MSIPX
   DEVICE=C:\&lt;Windows 3.1 directory&gt;\HIMEM.SYS   &lt;valid path&gt;NETX
   &lt;Third-party disk-partitioning driver&gt;        PROMPT $P$G
   &lt;Third-party disk-compression driver&gt;         PATH=C:\WINDOWS;C:\DOS;C:\
   &lt;Other required third-party drivers&gt;          SET TEMP=C:\&lt;valid path&gt;
   DEVICE=&lt;valid path&gt;\PROTMAN.DOS /I:&lt;directory
           where PROTOCOL.INI is located&gt;
   DEVICE=&lt;MAC DRIVER&gt;.DOS
   DEVICE=&lt;valid path&gt;MSIPX.SYS
   DEVICE=&lt;valid path&gt;WORKGRP.SYS
   SHELL=C:\&lt;valid path&gt;\COMMAND.COM  /E:1024 /P
   LASTDRIVE=P
   STACKS=9,256

</PRE><h3>Exceptions</h3>
 
<P>
The following are examples of drivers that should NOT be removed;
these drivers are used when the computer is turned on to make the hard
drive accessible. This is not a complete list, but it does include
most of the commonly used drivers:
<P>
<PRE>   Hard Disk Drivers:          SQY55.SYS, SSTBIO.SYS, SSTDRIVE.SYS,
                               AH1544.SYS, ILIM386.SYS, ASPI4DOS.SYS,
                               SCSIHA.SYS, SCSIDSK.EXE, SKYDRVI.SYS,
                               ATDOSXL.SYS, NONSTD.SYS

   Disk-Partitioning Drivers:  DMDRVR.BIN, SSTOR.SYS, HARDRIVE.SYS,
                               EDVR.SYS, FIXT_DRV.SYS, LDRIVE.SYS,
                               ENHDISK.SYS

   Disk-Compression Utilities: STACKER.COM, SSWAP.COM, SSTOR.EXE,
                               DEVSWAP.COM

</PRE>If the purpose of a device driver or program is unknown, do NOT remove
it. Most device drivers and programs display a message describing the
purpose when they are initialized.
<P>
A clean boot does NOT include the following:

<UL><LI>DOS=HIGH,UMB
<LI>EMM386.EXE
<LI>INSTALL=SHARE.EXE
<LI>INSTALL=FASTOPEN.EXE
<LI>Third-party memory managers
<LI>RAM disk devices
<LI>JOIN, GRAPHICS, PRINT, SUBST, APPEND
<LI>MODE for printer redirection
<LI>Multiple path statements
<LI>MS-DOS-level mouse drivers
<LI>Third-party disk caches
<LI>Various third-party TSRs
<LI>LOGIMENU, CLICK
<LI>Virus checkers
<LI>Drivers for scanners/fax
<LI>Drivers for CD-ROM/network
<LI>Tape backup spoolers/redirectors/buffers
<LI>Data acquisition units
<LI>Keyboard accelerators/buffers
