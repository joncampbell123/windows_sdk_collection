The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SQL Server version 6.5
</UL> 
BUG #: Windows: 16977
<P>
IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry  Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
During the installation of SQL Server 6.5, the MSDB database may not be
created.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Installation of SQL Server is completed with SQL Server started in single
user mode. Performing a default installation of SQL Server invokes the
sp_sqlregister startup stored procedure. This procedure makes a loopback
connection to the SQL Server. Occasionally, this connection succeeds and
prevents the ISQL connection that creates MSDB from connecting. There are
no errors in the SQL errorlog to indicate a failure. The following are the
only indications of a failure:

<UL><LI>MSDB is missing.

<LI>There is a "Login failed" error in the Instmsdb.out file.

<LI>There is an "Unable to write to Mailslot" error in the Windows NT
   application event log.
<P>
</UL><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, do either of the following:

<UL><LI>Use a modified Setup.inf file that enables trace flag 4022. This
   prevents the sp_sqlregister stored procedure from executing. You can
   also modify the Setup.inf file to remove the trace flag. This workaround
   requires you to copy all the files to the hard drive and run the
   installation from the hard drive after replacing the default Setup.inf
   with the modified one.
<P>
   -or-
<P>
</UL>WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor
can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

<UL><LI>Using a .reg file, place the 4022 trace flag in the following registry
   location (note that this should all be on one line):
<P>
<P><PRE>      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\MSSQLSERVER\MSSQLSERVER
      \Parameters
</PRE><P>
   With this method, you must remove trace flag 4022 from the registry
   either manually or by using the xp_regdelvalue stored procedure. This
   workaround allows the installation to be run from the SQL Server CD.
<P>
</UL>The files for both workarounds are in the Instmsdb.exe file located at:
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A href="ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/sql/public/">ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/sql/public/</A></B>

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SQL Server version 6.5. We
are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
