<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 

<OL><P><LI>Default Sort Order and Default Character Set
<P>
</OL>For SQL Server version 6.0, the default sort order is "Dictionary order,
case-insensitive" and the default character set is "ISO 8859-1 (Latin 1 or
ANSI)". In SQL Server version 4.2x, the default sort order is "Binary
order" and the default character set is "850 Multilingual".

<OL><P><LI>System Table Changes
<P>
</OL>There have been several changes to system tables: new columns have been
added, the meaning or contents of some columns has been changed, and some
new system tables have been added.

<OL><P><LI>System Stored Procedure Changes and Changes in Format
<P>
</OL>There have been several changes to system stored procedures. In many cases
the functionality has been expanded to include new SQL Server version 6.0
features.
<P>
The function of some stored procedures has been integrated into the server
itself, as in the case of sp_primarykey, and so forth. In some cases, the
format of the output has been modified to provide a clearer presentation of
the information.

<OL><P><LI>BETWEEN Requires Low &lt;= Hi
<P>
</OL>When using the "z BETWEEN x AND y" comparison, x must now be less than or
equal to y to return any matching values of z. To be ANSI compliant, it now
acts as "z &gt;= x AND z &lt;= y" whereas previously it would effectively swap x
and y if x was larger before performing the comparison.

<OL><P><LI>Changes in LIKE with Fixed-Length Character Values
<P>
</OL>The LIKE operator no longer treats trailing blanks in the pattern as
insignificant. Trailing blanks are significant and must match the source.
The former behavior for fixed length character was not ANSI standard.
Although the declaration of datatype was exact and fixed, the LIKE operator
wasn't considering it as such. ANSI's semantics for LIKE are different from
"="; they are 2 different operators, each with their own semantics. The
former functionality was not transferable to any other database. Trace flag
204 can be used to revert to the previous behavior, but affects other
enhancements as well.
<P>
NOTE: The LIKE operator not treating trailing blanks as insignificant,
refers to the LIKE pattern, not to the expression to which the LIKE pattern
is matched (which is often a column). Hence, the clause WHERE lname LIKE
<PRE>'smith   ' (three trailing spaces) would not match a CHAR(7) not null column
</PRE></OL>containing the value 'smith  ' (two trailing spaces). However WHERE lname like
<PRE>'smith ' (one trailing space) would match a CHAR(7) not null column
</PRE>containing the value 'smith  ' (two trailing spaces). For more details
see the "Search Conditions" section of the Transact-SQL Reference.

<OL><P><LI>Non-Aggregate Columns Must Appear in GROUP BY
<P>
</OL>In earlier releases of SQL Server, it was possible to have non-aggregate
columns in the SELECT list or columns in the SELECT list that were not also
listed in the GROUP BY clause. This often produced undesired results. For
ANSI compatibility, SQL Server version 6.0 does not allow non-aggregate
columns in the SELECT list or columns in the SELECT list that are not also
listed in the GROUP BY clause. Trace flag 204 can be used to revert to the
previous behavior, but affects other enhancements as well.

<OL><P><LI>Nested Aggregates Not Allowed
<P>
</OL>In SQL Server version 4.2x, the following nested aggregate was allowed:
<P>
<PRE>   select count(count(*))
   from &lt;table&gt;

</PRE></OL>In SQL Server version 6.0, an expression passed to an aggregate function
cannot contain an aggregate or a subquery. The following error message is
given:
<P>
<PRE>   Msg 130, Level 15, State 1  Cannot perform an aggregate function on an
   expression containing an aggregate or a subquery.

</PRE>Trace flag 204 can be used to revert to the previous behavior, but affects
other enhancements as well.

<OL><P><LI>&gt; All and &lt; All
<P>
</OL>Now ANSI Compatible Queries with &gt;ALL (greater than ALL) or &lt;ALL (less than
ALL) should evaluate to true when the subquery returns no rows. In earlier
releases, this situation evaluated to false (and subsequently no rows were
returned). ANSI compatibility has been implemented to cause this condition
to return all rows that meet the conditions of the outer query.

<OL><P><LI>Subqueries Now Conform to ANSI Standard
<P>
</OL>In addition to performance enhancements to subquery processing, SQL Server
version 6.0 has many ANSI-compatibility changes. Because of these changes,
it is important that you test all subqueries to ensure desired results in
your applications. Subqueries that define the scope of a NOT IN WHERE
clause should evaluate to UNKNOWN or FALSE for each row that returns a
NULL. In earlier versions of SQL Server, rows with NULL entries in the
evaluated column were returned as part of the NOT IN results set.
<P>
For ANSI compatibility, SQL Server version 6.0 returns only those rows with
valid data that is not in the subquery search condition. Subqueries in the
WHERE clause were previously evaluated such that an EXISTS, IN, or ANY,
when zero rows met the request, caused the entire query to return zero rows
even if the outer query used an OR for the conditions. In SQL Server
version 6.0, each condition is evaluated separately to provide accurate
results when one or more condition(s) return no results. In earlier
releases, in correlated subqueries where duplicates exist, a query that
includes aggregates and EXISTS subqueries sometimes evaluated the query
incorrectly. In SQL Server version 6.0, these queries are resolved because
the subquery is evaluated first.
<P>
In earlier releases, evaluating a SELECT DISTINCT correlated subquery
within an IN condition of the outer query would cause the outer query to
return no rows. In SQL Server version 6.0, this has been resolved so that
DISTINCT values are returned to the outer query for evaluation. Correlated
subqueries that reference the same table as the outer query need to alias
and properly identify each occurrence of that table. If an alias is used in
the FROM clause, it should also be used in the WHERE clause and, if
referenced, then also aliased correctly in the subquery.

<OL><P><LI>Use of Aliases
<P>
</OL>If you have aliased the table, you must use the alias throughout the query
in place of the table name. The following query worked in version 4.21a and
does not work in version 6.0:
<P>
<PRE>   select authors.au_lname
   from authors auth

</PRE></OL>SQL Server version 6.0 gives the error message:
<P>
<PRE>   The column prefix 'authors' does not match with a table name or alias
   name used in the query.

</PRE>This syntax checking was tightened up as the optimizer was improved.

<OL><P><LI>## Tables and Stored Procedures Are Now Global
<P>
</OL>Any table name or stored procedure name that begins with ## (two number
signs) now indicates that the table or stored procedure should be
accessible globally. In version 4.2x, a table or stored procedure named
##test, for example, was available only to the creating connection, which
remains the case in version 6.0 for names beginning with one number sign.

<OL><P><LI>Column Nullability depends on database and session settings.
<P>
</OL>The default nullability of a column now depends on session settings. In
version 4.2x, you declared a column to be NULL or NOT NULL and if it was
not specified, the default was NOT NULL. You explicitly had to allow a
column to be set to NULL. In version 6.0, the server-wide default is still
NOT NULL but this can be overridden at the database level and at the
session level.
<P>
The ANSI standard default is NULL; it is recommended that you always
specify NULL or NOT NULL when creating the column rather than depending on
the database or session settings. You can set the database default by using
the sp_dboption 'ANSI null default' and the session level default by using
the SET statement to set ANSI_Null_Dflt_On or ANSI_Null_Dflt_Off.

<OL><P><LI>Stored Procedure Parameter Checking
<P>
</OL>SQL Server version 6.0 now checks stored procedure calls for too many
parameters, or the use of named parameters that were not on the parameter
list. For example, sp_help takes an @objname parameter; calling sp_help
@obj = 'SomeName' SQL Server version 4.2x did not fill @objname and
operated as if no parameters were specified, and did not give an error. SQL
Server version 6.0 detects the parameter name mismatch and issues the
following error:
<P>
<PRE> Msg 8145, Level 16, State 2 @obj is not a parameter for procedure sp_help.

</PRE><P><LI>Quotes When SET QUOTED_IDENTIFIER ON Is Set
<P>
</OL>When SET QUOTED_IDENTIFIER ON has been given, double quotes (") can
only be used to delimit identifiers; they cannot be used to delimit
strings. ANSI specifies that single quotes delimit strings and double
quotes are only used to avoid problems with reserved words. SQL Server
version 6.0 by default assumes a single quote or a double quote begins and
ends a string, as does version 4.2x. However, once the SET option has been
specified, version 6.0 assumes double quotes are used only as delimiters
for identifiers; strings must be delimited by single quotes.

<OL><P><LI>Primary Keys and Foreign Keys
<P>
</OL>The stored procedures sp_primarykey, sp_commonkey, sp_dropkey,
sp_foreignkey, sp_helpjoins, sp_helpkey, and the syskeys table are included
for backward compatibility only. These procedures (and the syskeys table)
are related to old style primary and foreign keys that do not implement
referential integrity. To utilize SQL Server version 6.0 declarative
referential integrity (DRI), use the ALTER TABLE and the CREATE TABLE
statements. Use the sp_help or the sp_helpconstraint system stored
procedures to view constraint information. Note that sp_pkeys and sp_fkeys
still return valid information, however that information is now based on
the true declarative referential integrity from the CREATE and ALTER TABLE
statements.

<OL><P><LI>ODBC SQL Server Driver Has ArithAbort Turned On
<P>
</OL>The ODBC SQL Server driver has arithabort turned on. This is designed to be
consistent with the ODBC standard that states that numeric overflows and
divide by zero errors are fatal. This may cause a change in some ODBC tests
because they may have been coded to the previous default behavior.

<OL><P><LI>User-Defined Datatype Names
<P>
</OL>In version 4.2x, it is possible to create a user-defined datatype named INT
which in version 6.0 is taken to mean the same as 'int'. The case of a
datatype's name is no longer relevant. Integer and Character are now
alternative forms of int and char.

<OL><P><LI>Raiserror Error Numbers
<P>
</OL>In version 4.2x, the user error numbers started at 20,000; in SQL Server
version 6.0, error numbers up to 50,000 are reserved.

<OL><P><LI>Dumps Appended By Default
<P>
</OL>In version 4.2x, dumping to a device that already contained a dump would
overwrite the existing data with the newer information; in SQL Server
version 6.0, the newer information is appended by default; the user must
use INIT to overwrite an existing dump. Users may discover that their dump
devices fill up now where they never did before.

<OL><P><LI>'Conditional Compilation' No Longer Available
<P>
</OL>In a stored procedure using transact-SQL IF statements for conditional
execution based on parameters passed, under some conditions a "not taken"
IF block will now cause compilation to fail. This is so even if the
statement in the IF block causing the error should not be checked until run
time (such as a convert).
<P>
This did not happen on version 4.21x. The error in this scenario was:
<P>
<PRE>   Failure msg: Msg 249, Level 16, State 1
   Syntax error converting CHAR value 'sysobjects' to an INT4 field.

</PRE></OL>A change from version 4.2x to 6.0 causes compile-time evaluation of
constant expressions in some cases where it was not performed previously.
Compile-time evaluation has the performance advantage of allowing the
optimizer to know SP parameters. In general, the version 4.2x server has
always done this, version 6.0 now does it in a few more cases. As a side-
effect, this gives errors for SPs which rely on the cases where compile-
time evaluation was not done in 4.2x, but is now in version 6.0.

<OL><P><LI>Extended Procedure Creation in Master Only
<P>
</OL>With SQL Server version 6.0 extended stored procedures (XPs) can now only
be created in the master database (DB), not in user DBs as you could
previously.

<OL><P><LI>DATEDIFF Function Changes
<P>
</OL>This example shows the difference in results of the new DATEDIFF function
in SQL Server version 6.0. The difference is minor; however, it accurately
reflects the number of "minute boundaries" that were crossed. For the
function call:
<P>
<PRE>   SELECT DATEDIFF(minute, 'jan 1 1995 22:30:16', 'jan 1 1995 23:30:15')

</PRE></OL>In earlier releases the number of "minute boundaries" returned by this
query was 59. In SQL Server version 6.0, the number of "minute boundaries"
crossed is 60.

<OL><P><LI>Numeric Constants with Decimal are Numeric, Not Float
<P>
</OL>In SQL Server version 4.2x, a numeric constant containing a decimal point
was represented by a Float value. In SQL Server version 6.0, numeric
constants containing a decimal point are represented by a Numeric value.

<OL><P><LI>Extended Procedures Must be Recompiled and Relinked
<P>
</OL>You have to recompile and link with the OPENDS60.LIB file to use your
extended stored procedure with SQL Server version 6.0. See the Microsoft
SQL Server version 6.0 Books Online, "Programming Open Data Services,"
Chapter 2, System Requirements, "Existing Open Data Services applications
must be recompiled and rebuilt using Open Data Services 6.0."

<OL><P><LI>Null Checks Are Runtime Now
<P>
</OL>Checks for the assignment of NULL to a NOT NULL column are made at run time
rather than at compile time whenever possible as in version 4.2x. A
violation results in a command abort thus backing out the INSERT or UPDATE
that caused the violation but continuing with the batch or transaction.
NULL assignment violations behave the same as an equivalent constraint
violation. Trace flag "243" reverts to the old version 4.2x behavior.

<OL><P><LI>Embedded Keywords
<P>
</OL>To implement many of the new features of SQL Server 6.0, as well as to be
more ANSI compliant, many new words have been added to the list of
keywords reserved by SQL Server (see the lists below). The CHKUPG.EXE
utility detects the use of new reserved keywords in the existing database,
but it cannot detect those embedded in applications or other scripts. So
even if the database gets an "okay" from CHKUPG.EXE, there is still the
possibility that an application could submit a query using a reserved
keyword, such as SELECT KEY FROM TABLE, and so forth. These keywords
should either be changed to a non-keyword, or they should be double-quoted
(a 'quoted identifier) and used with the 'SET QUOTED IDENTIFIER ON'
session option.

<OL><P><LI>Temporary Tablename Lengths
<P>
</OL>In SQL Server version 6.0, you may now code up to 20 characters for a
temporary #tablename; all 20 characters will be used. If more than 20
characters are given, you will get this error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Msg 193, Level 15, State 1 The object or column name starting with
   '#23456789_123456789_1' is too long. The maximum length is 20
   characters.

</PRE></OL>In SQL Server version 4.21a, you could code a temporary #tablename longer
than 13 characters, but only the first 13 would be used (the remainder of
the 30 bytes would be used for a system generated string). The version
4.21a "Transact-SQL Reference" manual, under the section entitled
"Temporary Tables", states "The name must not exceed 13 characters,
including the initial #."

<OL><P><LI>Null from Nested Select Will Produce Row in Results Set (similar to #9)
<P>
</OL>In SQL Server version 6.0, the following two queries return identical
results, with the inner select in the first select performing similarly to
the outer join in the second select.
<P>
In SQL Server version 4.21a, the first select returns fewer rows, omitting
those rows in authors where the inner select returned a null. This is also
true on singleton selects (without the 'max' which was added because the
inner select in this example may return more than one row).
<P>
<PRE>   use pubs
   go
   select au_id,
     (select max(title_id)
      from titleauthor ta
      where ta.au_id = au.au_id)
   from authors au
   go
   select au.au_id, max(ta.title_id)
   from authors au, titleauthor ta
   where au.au_id *= ta.au_id
   group by au.au_id
