<P>
<PRE>  - Microsoft SQL Server, version 4.2
</PRE> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
It is necessary to frequently examine DBCC output and the SQL error logs to
check for problems. This can be an error-prone or laborious process,
especially if you must do this on several servers, each of which may have
multiple databases.
<P>
Windows NT ships with a powerful pattern-searching utility called
FINDSTR.EXE, which can be used to greatly automate this task. It is even
possible to conditionally execute a batch file based on whether certain
error strings are found. This article describes how to do this, including
examples.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Findstr is a high-performance pattern searching utility that uses Win32
asynchronous and file-mapped I/O for best throughput. It allows the use of
regular expressions, recursive searching down a directory tree, and the
ability to exclude patterns thus achieving a NOT function. See your Windows
NT documentation for more information.
<P>
There are two basic approaches to searching SQL error logs or DBCC output
for errors:
<P>
<PRE>   1. State explicitly what strings to find.

   2. State what strings you do not want to find, which will show you
      all but these.

</PRE>In the first approach, you build a list of strings that define errors you
want findstr to match. This list of strings can be supplied as an input
file to findstr.
<P>
For example, say you want to find any occurrences of these strings "table
corrupt" (which accompanies many serious data errors), and "msg 605" (which
is a specific type of error). Place into a file these strings, so the
content simply looks like this:
<P>
<PRE>   table corrupt
   msg 605

</PRE>Run findstr on the DBCC output files using this syntax:
<P>
<PRE>   findstr /i /g:search.txt dbcc.* &gt; findstr.out

</PRE>where SEARCH.TXT is the file containing the search strings, and dbcc.*
matches a group of dbcc output files to search, and FINDSTR.OUT is where
the search results are placed.
<P>
The challenge with this approach is knowing ahead of time what error
strings to search for. Unfortunately, there is no comprehensive list of SQL
error strings which encompasses all possible DBCC, server, and kernel
errors. However, merely searching for these strings may provide fairly good
coverage as a starting point: "table corrupt", "level 16", "level
17"..."level 21", "Severity: 16", "Severity: 17"..."Severity: 21."
<P>
Using a little experimentation, it is usually possible to further refine
this and get fairly reliable checking (certainly more reliable than doing
so by eye).
<P>
The other approach involves using the "reverse match" capability of findstr
to exclude a list of search strings. This approach is more easily applied
to DBCC output than to error log output, since there are fewer distinct
strings which require exclusion. In some ways this approach, if applicable,
is safer since you are only explicitly stating what NOT to match, and any
new or unanticipated errors will be shown by default.
<P>
For example, say you want to exclude all strings in a series of DBCC output
files which contain the strings "The total number", "Table has", and
"checking". Study indicates this will exclude many non-essential DBCC
status messages, and will not result in loss of any errors. Place into a
file these strings, so that the contents simply looks like this:
<P>
<PRE>   The total number
   Table has
   checking

</PRE>Run findstr on the DBCC output files using this syntax:
<P>
<PRE>   findstr /v /i /g:search.txt dbcc.* &gt; findstr.out

</PRE>where SEARCH.TXT is the file containing the search strings, and dbcc.*
matches a group of dbcc output files to search, and findstr.out is where
the search results are placed. The /v parameter indicates "reverse match",
which effectively matches all strings except those in the list.
<P>
Here is a sample exclusion list for error logs, which will filter out non-
essential messages and let through most significant errors.

</PRE>In some cases combining these two approaches blends the best
characteristics of both, or at least allows working around difficult
problems which arise from using just one.
<P>
For example, say you are searching your error logs for the strings
"Severity: 16", "Severity: 17"..."Severity: 21", which should match most
serious errors. But you notice in your search output several communication-
related errors such as 1608 and 17832 that are normally not indicative of a
serious problem. You can keep your original search conditions, and exclude
only these specific unwanted errors from the search output by piping one
findstr command into another:
<P>
<PRE>   findstr /i /g:search.txt errorlog*.* | findstr
   /v /i /g:exclude.txt &gt; f.out

</PRE>where search.txt is the file containing the search strings, and errorlog*.*
are your SQL error log files to search, and EXCLUDE.TXT is the file
containing the search strings to exclude, and F.OUT is where the search
results are placed. This approach can be cascaded several levels deep,
excluding successively more at each level.
<P>
It is possible to write a batch file which conditionally takes action based
on whether findstr detects a certain error string. This technique uses the
Windows NT conditional processing commands which are "&amp;&amp;" and "||". The
following command executes the batch file BATCH1.BAT if any of the SQL
error strings in the file SEARCH.TXT are found:
<P>
<PRE>   findstr /i /g:search.txt errorlog*.* &amp;&amp; batch1

</PRE>BATCH1.BAT could invoke a program, or even run an ISQL job which uses the
xp_sendmail capability of SQL Server 4.21 to send a mail message, notifying
an operator of a problem.
<P>
The above techniques can be combined to perform a variety of tasks. For
example the following batch file will continuously run a findstr command
that conditionally executes BATCH1.BAT if any of the SQL error strings in
the file SEARCH.TXT are found, excluding the strings in EXCLUDE.TXT.
<P>
<PRE>   echo off
   :start
   findstr /i /g:search.txt errorlog*.* | findstr
   /v /i /g:exclude.txt &amp;&amp; (echo WARNING &amp; batch1)
   goto start

</PRE>With a little experimentation you will find these techniques can be very
helpful in reducing the labor involved in searching SQL error log and DBCC
output files. These same techniques can also be used for any general text-
searching task, not just those related to SQL Server.
