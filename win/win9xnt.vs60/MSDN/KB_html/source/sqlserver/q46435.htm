<PRE>  - Microsoft SQL Server version 4.2 for OS/2
</PRE> 
<P>
Deadlock should not be confused with waiting for access. In SQL
Server, there is no time-out period for deadlocks. One of the
participating processes is immediately aborted. The dbproc can still
be used. The effect is the same as though a trigger procedure caused a
ROLLBACK to be executed. Microsoft has confirmed this with two copies
of ISQL.
<P>
On the other hand, if a process requests a row that is being used by
another process, the first process will wait until the second process
releases the row. This is not a deadlock. A deadlock would occur if
the second process were also waiting for the first process (or any
closed loop of waiting processes). In the non-deadlock case, the
second process may release the row at any time, and the first process
will wait until it does (or until the user-specified time-out
expires). If dbsqlexec returns via time-out, the user-defined error
handler will be called with message 10003 and dbsqlexec will return
FAIL. The dbproc will be dead and must be reopened. Microsoft has
confirmed this, also. Also, remember to check your return codes.
