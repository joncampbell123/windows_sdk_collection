The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SQL Server, version 4.21a
</UL> 
BUG# NT: 8729 (4.21a)
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In a database with a large table that has heavy updates being done to it,
doing a dump to tape or diskette that spans multiple tapes/diskettes can
cause SQL Server to become unresponsive.
<P>
When you dump to tape, new logins may be allowed, but any queries issued by
the new or existing logins will not return. This includes queries issued in
other databases.
<P>
When you dump to diskettes, new logins may never complete the login
process. Existing connections will not complete queries.
<P>
In both scenarios, the events never time out. These indications remain
until the dump media is swapped after it becomes full. With tape, all
events continue as soon as the new tape is installed, and the dump process
is continued. With diskettes, the indications remain until the last
diskette of the dump is in the drive and being used by the dump process.
<P>
If the dump process is canceled or interrupted, SQL Server could be left in
the state described, requiring a reboot of the system in order to recover.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
The best solution is to continue the dump process and let the process
continue.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SQL Server
version 4.21a. Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
