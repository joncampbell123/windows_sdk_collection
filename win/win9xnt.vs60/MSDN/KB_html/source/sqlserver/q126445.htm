<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article discusses some of the common client-side problems encountered
when attempting to connect to Microsoft SQL Server in a Banyan VINES
network environment.
<P>
The article provides detailed error messages that would be generated by SQL
Server VINES client-side network library (net-library) when attempting to
connect.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Error:
<P>
<PRE>   SQL Server Error 1004, Severity 9, State 0
   Unable to connect. SQL Server is unavailable or does not exist.
   Name not found in directory service.
   OS Error 1011, ConnectionOpen (VnsGetSppPort()).

</PRE>Cause:
<P>
The error is caused when the PC-based service name used for the connection
string (server name) does not exist. Check to make sure that the name,
group, and organization are correct, and that the PC-based service has been
created. If you did not provide the complete StreetTalk name
(name@group@org) for the PC-based service, check to make sure that the
group and organization are part of your Banyan default search group. The
error can also occur when the client is not logged in to the Banyan network
or the StreetTalk name provided is not a PC-based service.
<P>
Error:
<P>
<PRE>   SQL Server Error 1004, Severity 9, State 0
   Unable to connect. SQL Server is unavailable or does not exist.
   General network error. Check your documentation
   OS Error 155, ConnectionOpen (VnsSocketSend()).

</PRE>Cause:
<P>
The error indicates that no SQL Server is available at the location that
was provided during the PC-based name resolution. Check to make sure that
SQL Server has started correctly. There should be no Open Data Services
(ODS) errors in the Windows NT Event Log on the SQL Server computer (under
the Application log). Also make sure that the PC-based service name given
by the client is the same PC-based service that SQL Server is using.
