<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When executing queries from a 16-bit Windows application using
Dbmssoc3.dll, the query timeout can occur earlier than that set by the
application. This problem occurs only if the application sends queries
using blocking calls such as  dbsqlexec() in DB-Library, and the timeout
value is set to more than 60 seconds.
<P>
This problem can also occur in ODBC applications.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
SQL Server socket net-library for windows (Dbmssoc3.dll) does not timeout
correctly according to the value set by the DB-Library or ODBC
applications.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
There are two possible workarounds:
<P>
1) Use non-blocking calls to execute queries. For example, in DBLIB,
instead of calling dbsqlexec(), you can call dbsqlsend() to send the query
first, and then call dbdataready() repeatedly until it returns true, and
finally call dbsqlok(). You'll need to implement your own timeout mechanism
to break out of the dbdataready() loop. For more information, please
consult the Programmer's Reference for C.
<P>
2) Set the timeout value to less than 60 seconds, and use a counter to
control the accumulated timeout value until it is equal to the ideal
setting. For instance, in DBLIB, you can code your error handler to always
return INT_CONTINUE on the timeout error until the total amount of time
waited is equal to your ideal setting. If you want to set the query timeout
to 120, for example, you can set the initial timeout value to 30 seconds,
and have the error handler return INT_CONTINUE until the timeout error
occurs consecutively four times.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SQL Server
versions 6.0 and 6.5. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
