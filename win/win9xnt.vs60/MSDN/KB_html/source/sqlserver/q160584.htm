The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SQL Server, versions 6.0 and 6.5
</UL> 
BUG #: 15657 (Windows NT: 6.0)
<PRE>       16163 (6.5)

</PRE><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If a transaction is rolled back in a 'single user' database, a Msg 3307
error will occur, followed by a handled access violation. The server will
stop responding, and no connections or queries will be allowed into the
server at this point.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, avoid rolling back transactions in a 'single
user' database.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SQL Server
versions 6.0 and 6.5. This problem has been corrected in U.S. Service
Pack 3 for Microsoft SQL Server version 6.5. For more information, contact
your primary support provider.
<P>
MORE INFORMATION
 
<P>
When this problem occurs, the following type of error information is
returned to the client application (specific process and page information
will likely be different for each scenario):
<P>
<PRE>   Msg 3307, Level 21, State 1
   Process 13 was expected to hold logical lock on page 544.
   Error while undoing log row in database 'pubs'.  Rid pageid is 0x315 and
   row num is 0x8.
   The SQL Server is terminating this process.

</PRE>The following error information is written to the SQL Server errorlog:
<P>
<PRE>   spid13   Error : 3307, Severity: 21, State: 1
   spid13   Process 13 was expected to hold logical lock on page 544.
   spid13   Error : 3307, Severity: 21, State: 1
   spid13   Process 13 was expected to hold logical lock on page 544.
   kernel   WARNING: Process being freed while holding Dataserver semaphore
   spid-1   Error : 3307, Severity: 21, State: 1
   spid-1   Process -1 was expected to hold logical lock on page 544.
   [handled access violation information follows these messages]

</PRE>This problem may occur if the transaction is rolled back explicitly using
the ROLLBACK command, or if the client connection is terminated before the
transaction can be committed. SQL Server may stop responding under this
scenario, and cannot be shut down normally as a service. If the server was
started from the command line, it may be possible to shut it down by using
a CTRL+C key sequence. In either case, when the server is restarted, this
transaction should be properly rolled back by recovery.
