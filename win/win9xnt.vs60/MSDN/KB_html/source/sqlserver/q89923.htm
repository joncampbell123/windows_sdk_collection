<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
A mixed cursor is keyset-driven inside the keyset, but fully dynamic
outside the keyset. This article discuss the movement of a keyset in
this type of cursor.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
By using the Microsoft Cursor APIs in dblib, you can create four
different kinds of cursors: static, keyset-driven, dynamic, and mixed.
A keysetdriven cursor keeps all the keys of the result set locally and
the fetch buffer is smaller than the keyset. A dynamic cursor has the
fetch buffer equal to the keyset. A mixed cursor has keyset that is
larger than the fetch buffer, but smaller than the result set. Hence,
it is keyset-driven inside the keyset, but fully dynamic outside of
it.
<P>
While the fetch buffer can be moved by direct API calls
(dbcursorfetch, for example), the movement of keyset is always
implicit. In a fully keyset-driven cursor, the keyset does not move
because it is equal to the result set. In a fully dynamic cursor, the
keyset moves with the fetch buffer. The movement of keyset is more
involved in a mixed cursor. For example, for a mixed cursor, if the
result set size is 100, the keyset size is 20 and the fetch buffer is
10.
<P>
Also, assume that the fetch buffer starts from the third row in the
keyset. Then, a call to dbcursorfetch with FETCH_NEXT option will
return only the next eight rows (rows 13-20 in the keyset) because it
is unable to span the keyset boundary. To move the keyset down,
dbcursorfetch should be called with either FETCH_RANDOM or
FETCH_RELATIVE option, and the rownum set to 13. This will fetch the
next eight rows within the keyset. The next call to dbcursorfetch with
the FETCH_NEXT option will result in moving the keyset down and
fetching the two remaining rows. This is the only way that a keyset
can move in case of a mixed cursor.
