<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SQL Server version 4.2 for OS/2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article provides the basic information necessary to create a
simple SQL Server front-end using the Visual Basic Library for SQL
Server (VBSQL).
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
While considerably more complex applications can be developed using VBSQL,
the following steps provide the necessary framework to make a connection
with a SQL Server, execute Transact-SQL statements, and process results:

<OL><P><LI>Run Visual Basic and choose New Project from the File menu.

<P><LI>Add the VBSQL.VBX custom control to the project:
<P>
    a. From the File menu, choose Add.
<P>
    b. Select VBSQL.VBX from the \SQL\BIN directory.
<P>
    c. Once the file has been added to the project, the VBSQL control
       (an icon resembling a stop sign) should appear on the tool bar.

<P><LI>Add the VBSQL include file containing all the necessary function
    and routine declarations to the project:
<P>
    a. From the Window menu, choose Project Window.
<P>
    b. Select the GLOBAL.BAS module.
<P>
    c. From the Code menu, choose Load Text.
<P>
    d. Select the VBSQL.BI file from the \SQL\DBLIB\INCLUDE directory.

<P><LI>Declare a global integer variable for the connection to SQL
    Server by adding the following line of code to the beginning of
    the GLOBAL.BAS module:
<P>
       Global SQLConn%
<P>
    NOTE: The handle to the connection is an integer value. While
    SQLConn% is used in this example, the name of the handle is up to
    the discretion of the programmer. In addition, while not used in
    this example, multiple connections could be established by first
    declaring additional handles (SQLConn2%, SQLConn3%, and so on).

<P><LI>Add the VBSQL error/message handler control to the project:
<P>
    a. From the Window menu, choose Project Window.
<P>
    b. Select Form1.
<P>
    c. Choose the VBSQL Control ("stop sign" icon) from the ToolBox
       and place it on Form1.
<P>
       This control must be added to the form in the project prior to
       calling any VBSQL functions and/or routines. If it is not,
       unexpected errors may occur when an attempt is made to run the
       program. In addition, the control must be placed on a form that
       is always loaded into memory.

<P><LI>Add user-defined code to the error/message handler control by
    clicking the VBSQL control on Form1 and adding the following code
    to the error and message procedures:
<P>
<PRE>       Sub SQL_Error (SqlConn As Integer, Severity As
                      Integer, ErrorNum As Integer, ErrorStr
                      As String, RetCode As Integer)

           MsgBox "Error #:  " + Str$(ErrorNum) + Chr$(13) +
                  Chr$(10) + ErrorStr

       End Sub

       Sub SQL_Message (SqlConn As Integer, Message As Long,
                        State As Integer, Severity As
                        Integer, MsgStr As String)

           MsgBox "Message #:  " + Str$(Message) + Chr$(13)
                  + Chr$(10) + MsgStr

       End Sub

    These sample error and message handlers represent only the minimum
    amount of code necessary to identify both DB-LIBRARY (db-lib) and
    SQL Server error messages. In practice, you may want to enhance
    the handlers to provide your applications with more robust
    error-handling routines.

</PRE><P><LI>Initialize VBSQL by clicking Form1 and adding the following code
    to the Form Load code window:
<P>
       Message$ = SqlInit()
       If Message$ = "" Then
<PRE>           Beep
           MsgBox "SqlInit Error"
           End
       Else
           MsgBox Message$
       End If

    When the program is run, SqlInit() initializes the user-defined
    error and message handlers. In addition, it returns a string
    containing the version number of the DB-LIBRARY dynamic-link
    library (DLL) that is being used (W3DBLIB.DLL). If an empty string
    is returned, do not attempt to call any other VBSQL functions
    and/or routines and verify that both the W3DBLIB.DLL and
    DBNMP3.DLL files are located in the MS-DOS path. If a version
    string is returned, it must show that DB-LIBRARY 1.16 or later is
    being loaded. If not, unexpected results may occur when the
    program is run.

</PRE><P><LI>Add the necessary code to establish a connection with SQL Server:
<P>
    a. Click Form1 and add the following code to the Form Load code
       window:
<P>
<PRE>          Server$ = "servername"
          LoginID$ = "loginID"
          Password$ = "password"
          WorkSta$ = "user"
          AppName$ = "simple"

          SqlConn% = SqlOpenConnection(Server$, LoginID$,
                     Password$, WorkSta$, AppName$)

          If SqlConn% = FAIL Then
              MsgBox "Login failed"
              End
          End If

    b. If you choose, you can use the following code to connect to SQL
       Server in place of the preceding code:

          Login% = SqlLogin%()
          Results% = SqlSetLUser%(Login%, LoginID$)
          Results% = SqlSetLPwd%(Login%, Password$)
          Results% = SqlSetLApp%(Login%, AppName$)
          Rem  Un-remark the following line if you want to use
          Rem  the BCP APIs:
          Rem  Results% = SqlBCPSetL%(Login%, 1)
          SqlConn% = SqlOpen%(Login%, Server$)

          If SqlConn% = FAIL Then
              MsgBox "Logon failed."
              End
          End If

    Note that the first method is generally preferred because it is
    the simplest. However, if you want to use the BCP APIs for bulk
    copying data into or out of SQL Server, you must use the second
    method.

</PRE><P><LI>Add code to the form to select the desired database on SQL Server
    by clicking Form1 and adding the following code to the Form Load
    code window:
<P>
       Results% = SqlUse(SqlConn%, "pubs")
<P>
    This line of code will change the database context from the master
    database to the pubs sample database.

<P><LI>Add code to the form to execute Transact-SQL statements by
    clicking Form1 and adding the following code to the Form Load code
    window:
<P>
       Cmd$ = "select au_id, au_lname, au_fname from
<PRE>               authors"
       MsgBox Cmd$
       Results% = SqlCmd(SqlConn%, Cmd$)
       Results% = SqlExec(SqlConn%)
       Do While (SqlResults%(SqlConn%) &lt;&gt; NOMORERESULTS)
           Do While (SqlNextRow(SqlConn%) &lt;&gt; NOMOREROWS)
               ID$ =  Sqldata(SqlConn%, 1)
               LastName$ = Sqldata(SqlConn%,2)
               FirstName$ = Sqldata(SqlConn%, 3)
               Print ID$ + ":  " + LastName$ + ", " +
                     FirstName$ + Chr$(13) + Chr$(10)
           Loop
       Loop

    This query returns rows from the authors table in the pubs sample
    database. Other Transact-SQL queries could be executed by
    modifying the Transact-SQL statement in Cmd$ and adding additional
    Sqldata() statements as necessary.

</PRE><P><LI>Add code to the form to close the connection to SQL Server by
    clicking Form1 and adding the following code to the Form Load code
    window:
<P>
       SqlClose(SqlConn%)
<P>
    This function must be called selectively for each SQL Server
    connection opened with SQL Server. If not, sleeping processes may
    be left on the server. For more information, query on the
    following words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
       visual and basic and sleeping and processes
<P>
    An alternative method involves calling SqlExit. This procedure may
    be desirable when working with multiple connections because it
    effectively closes all open connections.

<P><LI>Uninitialize VBSQL prior to exiting the program by clicking Form1
    and adding the following code to the Form Unload code window:
<P>
       SqlWinExit
       End
<P>
    NOTE: If SqlWinExit is not called before exiting, you will
    receive the following error message the next time the application
    is run:
<P>
       Error 10001:  NULL DBPROCESS pointer encountered
<P>
</OL>Once the above steps have been completed, the sample program can be
run in interpretive mode under Visual Basic or compiled to an
executable file run directly from Windows.
