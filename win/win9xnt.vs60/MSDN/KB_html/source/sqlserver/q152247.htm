<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes some backup and upgrade strategies that you can
perform before upgrading SQL Server. In addition, there are helpful tips
included for performing a successful SQL Server upgrade operation. You
should review the Microsoft SQL Server documentation on upgrading SQL
Server before performing any SQL Server upgrade.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>BACKUP</h3>
 
<P>
During any upgrade application process, it is recommended that you have a
valid backup. Because Windows NT Server provides a file backup facility and
SQL Server provides dump and load capabilities, it is best to perform two
types of backup.
<P>
<P><h3>WINDOWS NT SERVER BACKUP</h3>
 
<P>
When using the Windows NT Server backup utility, stop SQL Server and back
up all the data and log device files, including Master.dat (which, by
default, are those files that end with a .dat extension). If you are unsure
about the file name, go to a query window, set your database to master, and
run the following command:
<P>
<PRE>   select * from sysdevices where cntrltype = 0 or cntrltype = 2

</PRE>Note the values in the phyname column.
<P>
Copy all the data and log device files to tape or to a temporary directory
other than SQL, SQL60, or any of their subdirectories; this prevents
accidental deletion of the SQL directory. It is a good idea to have a
recent backup of the registry. To learn how to back up the local registry
to tape, see the "Backing Up Disk Files to Tape" section of the Windows NT
Server documentation. After the upgrade successfully completes, you can
delete the temporary directory.
<P>
If time or space is limited, you can make a copy of the Master.dat file and
do a full dump all of the databases. See the next section of this article,
SQL SERVER DUMP, for details on how to dump all of the databases.
<P>
<P><h3>SQL SERVER DUMP</h3>
 
<P>
It is very useful to have the results of SELECT statements against the
sysdatabases, sysdevices, and sysusages table in the master database. To do
this, perform the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Go to a query window and run the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      /********************************/
      use master
      go
      print 'select * from sysdatabases'
      select * from sysdatabases
      print 'select * from sysdevices'
      select * from sysdevices
      print 'select * from sysusages'
      select * from sysusages
      /*********************************/
</PRE>
<P><LI>Save the results to a directory other than SQL, SQL60, or any of their
   subdirectories.

<P><LI>Start SQL Server in single-user mode by going to a Windows NT Server
   command prompt, changing to the Sql\Binn or Sql60\Binn directory, and
   running the following command:
<P>
<P><PRE>      sqlservr -c -m
</PRE>
<P><LI>Minimize the command prompt window.

<P><LI>Run sp_helpdb, DBCC CHECKDB, and DBCC NEWALLOC on each database. The
   script below will facilitate this for you. Save this script in a text
   file.
<P>
<P><PRE>      /*******************************************************/

         select @strDatabase = strName from #tblDatabases
         set rowcount 0
      end

      go

      /*******************************************************/

</PRE><P><LI>Go to another Windows NT Server command prompt window, change to the
   Sql\Binn or Sql60\Binn directory and run the following command:
<P>
<P><PRE>      isql -U sa -P &lt;password&gt; -S &lt;server_name&gt; -n -i &lt;input_file&gt; -o
      &lt;output_file&gt;
</PRE>
<P><LI>After this operation completes, use the output file that you created as
   the input file and use the following command to create a new output file
   for the results of the next query:
<P>
<P><PRE>      isql -U sa -P &lt;password&gt; -S &lt;server_name&gt; -n -i &lt;output_file&gt; -o
      &lt;new_output_file&gt;
</PRE>
<P><LI>Use the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base to assist you
   in scanning the new output file for errors:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../sqlserver/q115519.htm">Q115519</A></B>
<PRE></PRE>      TITLE     : INF: How to Scan SQL Errorlog or DBCC Output for Errors

</PRE><P><LI>If the databases are clean, proceed to dumping each database by running
   the following command:
<P>

      &lt;database_name&gt; to &lt;dump device name&gt;"
</PRE>
<P><LI>After that operation completes, take SQL Server out of single-user mode
   by closing both command prompt windows and starting up SQL Server as a
   service, using either the SQL Service Manager, SQL Enterprise Manager,
   or MSSQLSERVER in the Services Control Panel.
<P>
</OL><h3>CONFIGURATION</h3>
 
<P>
Set the default database of the system administrator (SA) to master by
typing the following command at a query window:
<P>
<PRE>   sp_defaultdb sa, master

</PRE></OL>For more information, see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../sqlserver/q135349.htm">Q135349</A></B>
   TITLE     : FIX: SQL 6.0 Upgrade Fails if SA Default DB is Not Master

</PRE>Make sure all the databases are NOT set to read-only by reviewing the
sp_helpdb output from the above script and reviewing the status column.
<P>
Check the SQL Server documentation to determine how much physical disk
space is required for the upgrade. The following are some other relevant
articles that concern disk space that you should read before upgrading SQL
Server:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../sqlserver/q149650.htm">Q149650</A></B>
   TITLE     : BUG: Upgrade Fails if Not Enough Space on Master for Tempdb

   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../sqlserver/q149566.htm">Q149566</A></B>
   TITLE     : BUG: Upgrade/Install Fails if Model DB is Larger Than Msdb

</PRE>Run the Chkupg.exe utility, which checks that the database status is
acceptable, that all necessary comments exist in the syscomments system
table, and that there are no keyword conflicts. You should resolve any
keyword conflicts before upgrading SQL Server.
<P>
Upgrading a database requires all objects to be scanned. In doing so, the
upgrade may exceed some of your current runtime configuration values. To
avoid this, you may want to temporarily double the size of the 'open
objects' and 'locks' options before the upgrade. If you chose to do this,
make sure you have enough memory dedicated to SQL Server to accommodate the
changed values.
<P>
Also, check how much memory is given to SQL Server. In SQL Server version
4.21a, the minimum value is 3,072 bytes (6 megabytes), while in SQL Server
versions 6.0 and 6.5, the minimum value is 4,096 (8 megabytes). If you have
additional physical RAM, increase the memory given to SQL Server to the
level recommended in the SQL Server documentation. For more information,
see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../sqlserver/q110983.htm">Q110983</A></B>
   TITLE     : INF: Recommended SQL Server for NT Memory Configurations

</PRE>In addition, make sure the open databases configuration option is equal to
or greater than the total number of databases on your system. You can use
sp_configure [&lt;config_name&gt; [, &lt;config_value&gt;]] from a query window to
change any of these configuration options. Dynamic options take effect
immediately after the RECONFIGURE statement has been run. For all
non-dynamic options, you must stop and restart SQL Server for the changes
to take effect. For details, see the documentation on the RECONFIGURE
statement.
<P>
Next, execute sp_helpsort to determine what sort order and character sets
you have installed. For SQL Server 6.0 and SQL Server 6.5, these values can
be found in appendix A of the setup book under "About Character Sets" and
"Sort Order Ids." For SQL Server 4.21a, these values can be found in the
configuration guide.
<P>
Shut down SQL Server and close any open SQL Server windows before
upgrading. In addition, make sure you are logged on to Windows NT Server as
an administrator or someone with administrative privileges. Logging on with
administrative privileges may still result in upgrade problems if the 'Full
Control' permissions have been revoked for administrator at either the file
level for NTFS partitions or at the registry level. Check that
administrator and system accounts have full control in the registry hives
listed in the TROUBLESHOOTING section of this article.
<P>
Finally, check the network capabilities. If the server that is being
upgraded does not have network capabilities, stop the Workstation service
to force the upgrade to use the local pipes. To do this, perform the
following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Open the Services Control Panel.

<P><LI>Select the Workstation service.

<P><LI>Click Close.
<P>
</OL>Alternatively, you can leave the Workstation service running and install
the MS Loopback Adapter. To do this, perform the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Open the Network Control Panel.

<P><LI>Click Add Adapter.

<P><LI>Select MS Loopback Adapter and click Continue.
<P>
</OL>You will be prompted for the Windows NT Server compact disc. Click OK to
install the MS Loopback Adapter. You must restart Windows NT Server when
the installation completes.
<P>
Go to the SQL Server Setup.exe that you want to upgrade to and upgrade SQL
Server. During the upgrade, it is best to specify the same drive and
directory to copy the SQL Server files to. Also, make sure you know the
correct password for the SA before upgrading.
<P>
NOTE: Upgrades from beta or evaluation versions of SQL Server are not
supported.
<P>
<P><h3>WINDOWS NT SERVER VERSIONS FOR SQL SERVER</h3>
 
<P>
If you are planning on upgrading the computer to Windows NT Server 4.0, the
sequence of upgrading SQL Server and Windows NT Server matters. For
additional information on the Windows NT operating system versions that
support Microsoft SQL Server versions 4.2x, 6.0, and 6.5, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../sqlserver/q122352.htm">Q122352</A></B>
   TITLE     : INF: Supported Windows NT Versions for SQL Server

</PRE></OL>If you have a 4.2x or 6.0 version of SQL Server running on Windows NT
Server 3.5 or 3.51, and you want to upgrade to SQL Server 6.5 and Windows
NT Server 4.0, you need to upgrade SQL Server first. SQL Server 6.5 is
supported on both Windows NT Server 3.51 and Windows NT Server 4.0.
However, SQL Server 4.21a and 6.0 are only supported on Windows NT Server
versions 3.5 or 3.51.
<P>
<P><h3>TROUBLESHOOTING</h3>
 
<P>
If the upgrade encounters a problem while copying files, correct whatever
error you received and try the upgrade again. If you encounter a problem
after copying all the files, remove all SQL directories and files in
Windows NT Explorer or File Manager and remove any entries in the registry
for SQL Server. Be very careful when editing anything in the registry. If
you delete a key that does not belong to SQL Server, you can restore the
registry backup that you made earlier, in the WINDOWS NT BACKUP section of
this article.
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall SQL Server. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved.
Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For SQL Server 4.21a, select and delete SQLServer and SQLMonitor found in
the following registry keys:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\SQLServer

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\SQLServer

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\SQLMonitor

</PRE>For SQL Server 6.0, select and delete MSSQLServer and SQLExecutive found in
the following registry keys:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\MSSQLServer

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSSQLServer

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\SQLExecutive

</PRE>After you have removed the entries, you have two options to try the upgrade
again:

<UL><LI>Reinstall the original SQL Server version. After it is installed, stop
   the SQL Server services and replace all of the data and log device
   files, including Master.dat, into their respective directories. You can
   find these directories from the phyname column in the output from the
   sysdevices table. Fix whatever caused the upgrade to fail and try the
   upgrade again. If the upgrade still does not successfully complete,
   contact your primary support provider.

<LI>Reinstall the SQL Server version that you are trying to upgrade to, then
   load the earlier version of the SQL Server databases. Note the user
   database dump (the master database is not allowed to be loaded or
   upgraded from earlier versions of SQL Server dumps) must be a full
   database dump, not a transaction log dump. Also, the SQL Server version
   that you are trying to upgrade to must be using the same sort order as
   the earlier version.
<P>
</UL>As with any database load, the user databases need to be re-created in
exactly the same way they were created. That is, the device usage, log
space allocation, and segment definitions in the new database must be
identical to how they were when the database was dumped. This information
is kept in the sysusages table in the master database. You can also find
this information in the output from the script that you ran earlier that
runs sp_helpdb, DBCC CHECKDB and DBCC NEWALLOC. Then run the CREATE
DATABASE statement again and the ALTER DATABASE statement to reestablish
the fragments.
<P>
<P><h3>SUMMARY</h3>
 
<P>
The following list summarizes the steps recommended for a SQL Server
upgrade:

<OL><P><LI>Select * from sysdatabases, sysdevices, and sysusages, and save the
   results.

<P><LI>Perform file backups of all the data and log device files.

<P><LI>Run DBCC CHECKDB on each database.

<P><LI>Put the server in single-user mode and run DBCC NEWALLOC on each
   database.

<P><LI>If DBCC CHECKDB and DBCC NEWALLOC show no errors, dump databases while
   the server is in single-user mode.

<P><LI>Take SQL Server out of single-user mode.

<P><LI>Set the default database of the SA to master.

<P><LI>Make sure no databases are set to read-only.

<P><LI>Make sure you have enough disk space to perform the upgrade.

<P><LI>Run Chkupg.exe.

<P><LI>Resolve any keyword conflicts before upgrading.

<P><LI>Increase the size of the 'open objects' and 'locks' options.

<P><LI>Increase the 'memory' option to recommended levels, especially if the
   current value is 3072.

<P><LI>Make sure the value of the 'open databases' option is greater than the
   number of databases on your system.

<P><LI>Run sp_helpsort and save the results.

<P><LI>Shut down SQL Server before upgrading.

<P><LI>Make sure you either are logged on to Windows NT Server as an
   administrator or have administrator privileges and the administrator has
   full control permissions at the file and registry level. Also, make sure
   you know the SA password.

<P><LI>Check the network capabilities of the server you are upgrading. Test
   whether the server is on the network by typing "net view" at a
   command prompt; see whether you can view other computers on your
   network.

<P><LI>Upgrade SQL Server.

<P><LI>Specify the same drive and directory to copy the new files to.
