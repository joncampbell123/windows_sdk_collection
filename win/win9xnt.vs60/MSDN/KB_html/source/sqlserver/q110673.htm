The information in this article applies to:
<P>
<PRE>  - Microsoft SQL Server, version 4.2
</PRE> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft SQL Server uses a concept called thread pooling to optimize
performance when very large numbers of clients are connected.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Normally, a separate operating system thread is spawned for each client
connection. This thread-per-connection architecture consumes less system
overhead than the process-per-connection approach of some other products.
However, at very high connection numbers (usually hundreds), even using
a thread-per-connection can consume operating system overhead. Therefore,
SQL Server can use a technique called thread pooling, whereby a pool of
worker threads services a larger number of client connections.
<P>
By default, this worker thread limit is 255, and can be viewed or changed
with sp_configure, as "max worker threads."
<P>
When this limit is reached, the SQL Server kernel message:
<P>
<PRE>   The working thread limit of 255 has been reached

</PRE>is printed in the errorlog.
<P>
Below this point, a new thread is spawned for each user connection. Above
this thread limit, new connections will share the existing pool of worker
threads. Since there are then more connections than threads, each new
request is handled by the next worker thread that completes its current
task. This process is quite efficient, as it is uncommon to have more than
255 (or whatever the max worker thread setting is) pending requests, even
on a system with hundreds of clients.
