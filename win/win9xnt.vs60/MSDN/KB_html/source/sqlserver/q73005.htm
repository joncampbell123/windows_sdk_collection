The information in this article applies to:
<P>
<PRE>  - Microsoft Embedded SQL version 4.2 for COBOL
</PRE> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
There is a sample application named COBLIB in the Software/Data
Library that shows how to create an Embedded SQL for COBOL MS-DOS
application consisting of an .EXE file linked with COBLIB that calls a
.GNT file. This method is very useful for large MS-DOS applications
because it lessens the memory required to load and execute the
application.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The COBLIB sample file consists of source code for DRIVER.CBL and
SQLDOS.CBL. It also includes COMPILE.CMD, which can be used to create
the application. SQLDOS.CBL is the same program that is included in
the Embedded SQL for COBOL Developer's Kit, except that it was
modified to change all "stop run" statements to "exit program"
statements. This allows control to return to DRIVER.EXE.
<P>
The basic idea is that DRIVER.EXE makes a call to SQLINTF.EXE to load
the Embedded SQL for COBOL support and then calls SQLDOS.GNT to
actually perform all the Embedded SQL for COBOL statements.
<P>
Please note that this requires that the COBPOOL environment variable
be set. Do this by typing "SET COBPOOL=10" at the MS-DOS prompt.
<P>
To create a similar OS/2 application, modify the following line in
DRIVER.CBL
<P>
<PRE>   CALL "SQLINTF.EXE"

</PRE>to read as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   CALL "SQLINTF.DLL"

</PRE>Then, modify the link line in COMPILE.CMD from the following
<P>
<PRE>   link driver.obj,,,coblib+cobapi;

</PRE>to the following:
<P>
<PRE>   link driver.obj,,,coblib+os2;

</PRE>COBLIB can be found in the Software/Data Library by searching on the
word COBLIB, the Q number of this article, or S13133. COBLIB was
archived using the PKware file-compression utility.
