<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you process results from an ESQL application, always take into
account that ESQL only processes a single result set. This is most likely
to become an issue when you execute a stored procedure via the EXECUTE
IMMEDIATE statement or use a CURSOR implementation.
<P>
For example:
<P>
Create procedure spTest
as
<PRE>   select au_lname from authors
   select au_fname from authors
</PRE>go
<P>
In a DB-Library application, this stored procedure is treated and retrieved
as two result sets: au_lname and au_fname. The DB-Library application calls
dbresults multiple times in conjunction with dbcmdrow to determine the
result set information.
<PRE> By design, ESQL is platform independent, allowing you to use the same
</PRE>source code and another precompiler to access a different DBMS environment.
To accomplish this, ESQL handles each statement as a single result set.
<P>
If you execute the spTest stored procedure, it really produces two result
sets from SQL Server, but the ESQL application will only see the first
result set.
<P>
The following code sample contains examples of executing a stored
procedure:
<P>
EXEC SQL BEGIN DECLARE SECTION;
<PRE>   char  strTest[15]    =  "spTest";
   char  strName[51]    =  "";
</PRE>EXEC SQL END DECLARE SECTION;
<P>
<PRE>//
// Install the error handlers
//
</PRE>EXEC SQL WHENEVER SQLERROR CALL ErrorHandler();
EXEC SQL WHENEVER SQLWARNING CALL ErrorHandler();
EXEC SQL WHENEVER NOT FOUND CALL ErrorHandler();
<P>
.
.
.
<P>
<PRE>//
// Using a cursor
//
</PRE>EXEC SQL DECLARE C_2 CURSOR FOR STMT1;
EXEC SQL PREPARE STMT1 FROM :strTest;
EXEC SQL OPEN C_2;
<P>
while(SQLCODE == 0)
{
<PRE>   EXEC SQL FETCH C_2 INTO :strName;
   .
   .
   .


//
// Using EXECUTE IMMEDIATE
//
</PRE>EXEC SQL EXECUTE IMMEDIATE :strTest;
.
.
.
<P>
Depending on how you attempt to process the results, you may get
different SQLCODE settings. When you are processing the results as a
cursor, the OPEN returns (0) and the FETCH will continue to return (0)
until it reaches the end of the first result set, and then it returns (100)
as expected.
<P>
The EXECUTE IMMEDIATE returns a SQLCODE of (1). As documented, EXECUTE
IMMEDIATE cannot return result rows.
<P>
We can complicate the issue a bit by adding a RAISERROR command to the
stored procedure.
<P>
Create procedure spTest
as
<PRE>   RAISERROR(50001, 1, 1)
   select au_lname from authors
</PRE>go
<P>
The RAISERROR statement will be treated as the result set that does not
return any result rows. In the case of the OPEN, the SQLCODE is set to
-50001, and in the EXECUTE IMMEDIATE, the SQLCODE is set to -50001. The
RAISERROR is considered to be the result set and you cannot access the
result rows returned from the select.
<P>
Reversing the stored procedure changes the behavior:
<P>
Create procedure spTest
as
<PRE>   select au_lname from authors
   RAISERROR(50001, 1, 1)
</PRE>go
<P>
You again get the select result set but you do not see the RAISERROR of
-50001 from the OPEN. However, the EXECUTE IMMEDIATE sets the SQLCODE to 1
because result rows were returned.
<P>
In all of the above examples, you can change the behavior by not returning
results, meaning that if you take the third variation of the stored
procedure and add a where clause--such as "where au_lname = '12'"--the
computer no longer returns result rows but an empty result set.
<P>
In this case, the SQLCODE is set to -50001 for both the OPEN and the
EXECUTE IMMEDIATE statements, because the first result set did not return
rows.
<P>
Finally, if you attempt to ignore the SQLCODE, you get unpredictable
results. If you do a RAISERROR and then a select, you can modify the cursor
code.
<P>
While((SQLCODE == 0) || (SQLCODE == -50001))
{
<PRE>   EXEC SQL FETCH C_2 INTO :strName;
   .
   .
   .

</PRE>This specific case allows you to process the results from the select
statement.
<P>
This is not a recommended or supported method of ESQL result set
processing. You should always guarantee that only one result set can be
returned from any given statement.
