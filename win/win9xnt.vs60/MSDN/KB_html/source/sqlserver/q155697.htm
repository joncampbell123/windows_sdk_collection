The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SQL Server, version 6.5
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The SQL Server 6.5 Setup fails in Windows NT 4.0 if a hardware profile is
used, which disables the network interface card (NIC). For example, in the
automatic Dial-up Networking portion of Setup, the following error message
appears:
<P>
<PRE>   Cannot reach &lt;servername&gt;, do you want to dial a remote network

</PRE>If you disable automatic Dial-up Networking, the following error message
appears:
<P>
<PRE>   The SQL Server installation could not be successfully completed.
   Setup could not connect to the SQL Server.

</PRE><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, do one of the following:

<UL><LI>Boot to Windows NT with a NIC-enabled hardware profile. You can set up a
   NIC even though the network cable has been disconnected.

<LI>Dial into your company network using Dial-up Networking and log on to a
   Windows NT Server. This enables the network named pipes, which allows
   SQL Server to set up successfully.

<LI>Install the MS Loopback Adapter driver and restart Windows NT. For
   additional information, please see the following article in the
   Microsoft Knowledge Base:

                  Network

</PRE></UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SQL Server
version 6.5. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
“Hardware Profiles” is a new feature in Windows NT 4.0. To access hardware
profiles, start Control Panel System and choose the Hardware Profiles tab.
You can create a hardware profile by clicking Copy. You can inspect the NIC
status of a particular profile by clicking Properties. Then, choose the
Network tab.
<P>
A NIC-disabled hardware profile is a common configuration for portable and
laptop computers. SQL Server Setup attempts to connect the network using a
network named pipe rather than a local named pipe. A network named pipe
includes the computer name and requires networking software to be function
on the computer. A local named pipe does not include the computer name and
does not require networking software to function on the computer. A local
named pipe is often expressed as a blank, empty, NULL server name, or as a
dot (.). Network named pipes do not work with a non-NIC hardware profile.
You can confirm this by running the SQL Server diagnostic program called
Makepipe at the MS-DOS Command Prompt (CMD.EXE). Another command you can
use is: Readpipe /&lt;server name&gt;
<P>
The Readpipe session is unable to connect; however, the “Readpipe /S”
(without quotation marks) command works.
