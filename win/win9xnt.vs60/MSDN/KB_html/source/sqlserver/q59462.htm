The information in this article applies to:
<P>
<PRE>  - Microsoft SQL Server version 4.2 for OS/2
</PRE> 
<P>
To be able to effectively manage transactions, transaction logging
is always required. Without transaction logging, a transaction could
not be rolled back. Even a single UPDATE statement that affected
multiple rows could not be trusted to complete in an atomic fashion or
even at all if it were not being logged.
<P>
For this reason, there is no way to turn off transaction logging,
although bulk copy operations (BCP or SELECT INTO) can bypass logging
if you set DBOPTION 'SELECT INTO' to true.
<P>
If you want to avoid the need to dump your transaction log, set
the TRUNCATE LOG ON CHECKPOINT option. By using this option, you can
keep the log at a minimum size; however, the log still must be large
enough to be able to roll back your largest single transaction. If
you perform a single update that affects many rows (or an entire
table), the log can still be very large indeed. If you encounter
this situation, you may be able to rewrite an UPDATE statement to
multiple UPDATE statements that each qualify only a subset of the
rows. (For example, where rows between 1 and 50000, then do another
udate where rows between 50001 and 100000.)
<P>
<PRE>Note: There is a down side of using TRUNCATE LOG ON CHECKPOINT.   Since
</PRE>you are not maintaining the logs, you also are not able to do
incremental recovery. That is, you cannot recover except to the last
dump database. You also cannot recover from transaction dumps.
