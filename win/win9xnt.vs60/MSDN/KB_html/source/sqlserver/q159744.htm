The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SQL Server, version 6.5
</UL> 
BUG #: 16292 (6.5)
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After you issue a ROLLBACK TRANSACTION command, you receive the following
error:
<P>
<PRE>   Msg 2, Level 16, State 16

</PRE>However, there is no such thing as msg 2. In addition, as with any server
message causing a DB-Library call to fail, it is likely that you will
receive DB-Library error 10007 "General error, check for other server
messages," as a signal to check for server messages.
<P>
This problem occurs if you have done the following in sequence:

<OL><P><LI>Created a local temporary table in a stored procedure.

<P><LI>Entered a user-defined transaction.

<P><LI>Cancelled the query.

<P><LI>Issued the ROLLBACK TRANSACTION command.
<P>
</OL><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Other than the unexpected DB-Library error 10007 and server message 2 being
returned to the client, there are no other adverse effects.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SQL Server
version 6.5. This problem has been corrected in U.S. Service Pack 3 for
Microsoft SQL Server version 6.5. For more information, contact your
primary support provider.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The sequence that causes this problem is normal for many applications. It
is common to get blocked on a lock while in a user-defined transaction,
then timeout and have the DB-Lib message handler return INT_CANCEL or
otherwise issue dbcancel(). If the other criteria are met as well, you will
receive message 2.
<P>
However, message 2 does not usually cause any problems. Applications should
always be prepared to receive any server message. They should not be hard
coded to expect specific numbers or types of server messages.
