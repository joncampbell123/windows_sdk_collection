The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SQL Server Programmer's Toolkit, version 4.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
An MS-DOS-based DB-Library (DB-Lib) application can have up to 15
connections to SQL Server. But if the application opens any files
before making the connections to SQL Server, the number of
available connections is reduced by the number of open files.
<P>
This is true even if the application is linked with CRT0DAT.OBJ and
_FILE.OBJ. These two object files are required if the application
needs to open more than 20 files in MS-DOS.
<P>
For example, suppose _FILE.C and CRT0DAT.ASM are modified to allow
50 open files. Once the application is compiled and linked with the
two object files, it can open up to 45 files successfully (MS-DOS
uses five of the 50 file handles). However, the number of
connections to SQL Server is still subject to the 20-file limit if
the application opens the files before making the SQL Server
connections.
<P>
In other words, if the application opens 10 files at the start, it
can make a maximum of five connections to SQL Server, even if the
application can have up to 45 file handles. On the other hand, if
the application makes the SQL Server connections first, more files
can be opened as long as the total number of connections and open
files does not exceed 45. For example, if the application makes 10
connections first, it can then open up to 35 files.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
SQL Server consumes the available DB-Lib connections in an
MS-DOS-based application if the files are opened before all the
available DB-Lib connections are used.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Make sure that your MS-DOS-based applications make all connections
to SQL Server before opening any other files.
