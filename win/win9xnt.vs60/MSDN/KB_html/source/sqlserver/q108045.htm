The information in this article applies to:
<P>
<PRE>  - Microsoft SQL Server, version 4.2 for OS/2
</PRE> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft SQL Server version 4.2 for OS/2 is supported on OS/2 versions 1.3
and 2.1 and may be used stand-alone or with appropriate networking
software.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
SQL Server version 4.2 for OS/2 is currently supported on OS/2 2.1 as both
a client and server platform in IBM and Novell network environments. It may
also be run in a stand-alone, single-user configuration without any network
software. However, for most sites it is recommended that you use OS/2
version 1.3, which ships with SQL Server version 4.2, as the preferred
operating system for the server software. OS/2 version 1.3 is stable and is
widely supported in all LAN environments.
<P>
Microsoft recommends that you run Windows-based applications in their
native environment on Microsoft Windows version 3.1. However, Windows-based
applications that access SQL Server will run on OS/2 version 2.1 as long as
you are using Microsoft LAN Manager version 2.2 or IBM LAN Server version
3.0. Internal testing has not found Windows-based applications on OS/2
version 2.1 to be a platform stable enough to recommend with other
networking software.
<P>
Microsoft SQL Server can operate on OS/2 version 2.1 as both a client and
server platform with the following network software:
<P>
- IBM LAN Server version 2.0 (Entry System) or version 3.0
<P>
- Novell NetWare Requester for OS/2 version 2.01
<P>
In addition, SQL Server is supported as a client with the LAN Manager 2.1
Productivity Pack and with LAN Manager 2.2, which supports OS/2 2.1
clients.
<P>
With the appropriate network configuration, SQL Server on OS/2 2.1 is
interoperable with components running on OS/2 1.3. (For example, an OS/2
2.1–based client can access SQL Server running on OS/2 1.3. OS/2 1.3– , MS-
DOS– , or Microsoft Windows–based clients can access SQL Server running on
OS/2 2.1.)
<P>
When both the computer hardware and the networking software support
addressable RAM greater than 16 MB, SQL Server can take advantage of
additional physical memory when running on OS/2 2.1. (Note that OS/2 2.1
itself uses more memory than OS/2 1.3.) For information about the ability
to address greater than 16 MB of physical RAM with OS/2 2.1 in your
environment, consult your hardware manufacturer or IBM.
<P>
Microsoft internal testing has found that SQL Server running on OS/2 2.1 is
typically slower and uses more memory than SQL Server running on OS/2 1.3.
These results are from pure on-line transaction processing (OLTP) tests.
The ability to address more cache memory might be useful for query-
intensive applications operating against very large databases (VLDBs). Note
that your "mileage" may vary.
<P>
When considering running SQL Server on OS/2 2.1, you should be aware of the
following considerations (NOTE: This information is based on internal
testing by Microsoft and is subject to change as newer releases of
components are made available):
<P>
- There is no separate version of SQL Server for OS/2 2.1. SQL Server 4.2
<PRE>  is compatible with both OS/2 1.3 and 2.1.

</PRE>- When you run the SQL Server setup, use the non-LAN Manager installation
<PRE>  option.
