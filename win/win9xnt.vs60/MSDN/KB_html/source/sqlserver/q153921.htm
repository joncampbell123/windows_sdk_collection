The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SQL Server versions 6.0 and 6.5
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Extra Extent locks, located on the next and previous Extents, are being
held during data modification statements.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
There are two possible workarounds to this problem:

<UL><LI>Increase the configuration option "Locks" to a sufficiently high value.
<LI>Break down the data modification statements into smaller transactions
   affecting fewer rows.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Extent locks are internal locks used by the server for locking Extents.
User queries cannot reference or control Extent locking.
<P>
For more information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   Article-ID: <B><A href="../sqlserver/q61795.htm">Q61795</A></B>
   Title     : INF: SQL Server Extent Allocation Information.

</PRE>With data modification statements such as insert, update, and delete,
Extent locks are obtained by the server for the purpose of storage
structure management. When the transaction results in changes to the Extent
structures, locks are also needed on the previous and next Extents to
maintain the integrity of the Extent chain. The extra locks were the locks
on the next and previous Extents.
<P>
This behavior is exhibited noticeably by replication-related tasks,
specifically the cleanup task, since cleanup deletes records from
distribution database tables and hence can run out of locks on large
systems.
