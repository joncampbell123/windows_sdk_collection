The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SQL Server, version 6.5
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The following equation, where 'y' is the sp_configure memory setting in
2-KB pages, and 'x' is the amount of RAM on the computer in MB
<P>
<PRE>   y=(.95x-22)*512

</PRE>Provides a way to estimate what the initial SQL Server memory setting
should be on a computer that is dedicated solely to SQL Server. You can
effectively use this equation on computers that have an amount of RAM
ranging from 64 MB to 2 GB. On smaller systems, ratioing the values in the
table below will provide a more accurate recommended configuration setting.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
From the Systems Administration for Microsoft SQL Server 6.5 Student
Workbook, the following data is provided for a start in allocating memory
to SQL Server:
<P>
Physical RAM
on a computer
dedicated to
<PRE>SQL Server       Memory dedicated to       sp_configure 'memory'
 (MB) {x}        SQL Server (MB) {y}       setting (in 2-KB pages)
</PRE> 
<P>
<PRE>   16                5.468                 2,800 (minimum, not recommended)
   24                  8                   4,096 (SQL Server 6.5 default)
   32                 16                   8,192
   48                 28                  14,336
   64                 40                  20,480
 128                 100                  51,200
 256                 216                 110,592
 512                 464                 237,568

</PRE>Using Excel Linear Regression capability, the last four values can be used
to generate slope and intercepts for a best-fit line of the form y = mx+b.
In this case, m = .9462 and b = (-22.09). For this purpose, .95 and (-22)
will suffice, and the equation becomes y = (0.95)*x-22.
<P>
Thus, the appropriate SQL Server memory setting in MB is: (0.95)*(the
amount of physical RAM on the computer, in MB) - 22.
<P>
Because the SQL Server memory setting is specified in 2-KB pages (for
example, 2,048 bytes) and because 1 MB equals 1,048,576 bytes, the
conversion factor from MB to 2-KB pages is (1,048,576/2,048) = 512
(2-KB pages/MB), the following equation delivers is the result:
<P>
The appropriate SQL Server sp_configure memory setting in 2-KB pages is:
(((0.95)*(the amount of physical RAM on the computer, in MB) - 22)*512).
<P>
That is, y = (.95x-22)*512
<P>
<P><h3>Notes</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>This estimation is only for computers dedicated solely to the use of SQL
   Server (that is, the computer is not running as a primary or backup
   domain controller, nor is it running WINS, DHCP, IIS, file and print
   services, or anything else that takes memory other than Windows NT
   Server or Workstation and SQL Server). If the computer is running other
   services, you can typically size the largest amount of memory that all
   of the other services or applications will use (and add some extra) and
   increase the '22' number (that is, the intercept/offset/'b') in the
   equation by that amount of additional RAM (in MB) that is unavailable.

<P><LI>The data this is based on is from 64 to 512 MB of RAM. As with all
   statistics, you need to be aware of the statistical insignificance when
   going outside of the range of the raw dataset. Specifically, when the
   amount of available RAM is less than 64, ratio to nearest number in the
   table to determine what your value should be.
<P>
   For example, if your computer had 36 MB of RAM and was dedicated to SQL
   Server, you would make the following calculations:
<P>
<P><PRE>      36 is 4 MB greater than 32, and because the gap in the table between
      32 and 48 is 16 MB, your 36 MB of RAM should call for a memory
      setting of 4/16=.25 of the gap between these to settings. That is,
      28 - 16 = 12 and (.25)*12 = 3, so for your 36-MB SQL Server computer
      dedicated to the server, a memory setting  of 16+3=19 MB is
      appropriate. Converting 19 MB to 2-KB pages implies an sp_configure
      memory setting of 19*512=9,728.
</PRE><P>
   On computers with more than 512 MB of RAM, this equation often provides
   a good benchmark.

<P><LI>Although this data set was specifically listed for SQL Server 6.5, it
   seems to work well for SQL Server 6.0 too.
