The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SQL Server, version 6.5
</UL> 
BUG #: 17054 (NT: 6.5)
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
For SQL Server version 6.5 U.S. Service Pack 1 and later, execution time is
slower for executing a query with a conditional clause on a view created
with a subquery than for the comparable query run directly against the
underlying tables. SET STATISTICS IO ON shows a higher scan count value
when the query is executed against the view rather than the underlying
tables.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The cost of creating the worktable for the subquery is not affected by the
conditional clause when executed against the view.

<UL><LI>Without the condition, the worktable creation cost is identical for the
   view and the query.

<LI>With the condition:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - The worktable creation cost is reduced for the query as a result of
      the reduction in applicable rows.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - The worktable creation cost for the view is the same as without the
      condition; there is no reduction in cost.
</PRE><P>
</UL><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To improve performance, do either of the following:

<UL><LI>Execute the query on the underlying tables rather than on the view.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Create a view that does not contain a subquery.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SQL Server
version 6.5 U.S. Service Pack 1 and onward. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
