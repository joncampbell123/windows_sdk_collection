<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
There are many reasons why you would need to determine what the oldest open
transaction is and who is holding it open. It could be that the transaction
log is not being truncated as expected, leading you to believe that there
is an open transaction preventing truncation. Or, you could be running into
significant blocking (or livelocks) that is preventing updates to the
database. Viewing the information in the oldest open transaction can
provide information on which user is holding the open transaction, as well
as what time the transaction was begun.
<P>
For more information on the transaction log filling up, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../sqlserver/q110139.htm">Q110139</A></B>
   TITLE: INF: Causes of SQL Transaction Log Filling Up

</PRE>A quick way of determining if an open transaction is preventing the log
from being truncated is to run the following query:
<P>
<PRE>   use &lt;database name&gt;
   go
   select first from sysindexes where id = 8
   dump tran &lt;database name&gt; with truncate_only
   select first from sysindexes where id = 8
   go

</PRE>If the values from the selects do not change, then you can follow the
method below to get more details.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following steps will allow you to examine the oldest open transaction
in SQL Server. The following steps must be run by the SA.

<OL><P><LI>First, determine the database ID of the database you are working on,
   send trace output to the client, and force a checkpoint record to be
   written out. This will ensure we are dealing with the most recent (and
   up-to-date) checkpoint record:
<P>
<P><PRE>      use &lt;database name&gt;
      go
      select db_id()
      checkpoint
      dbcc traceon(3604)
      go
</PRE>
<P><LI>Run the following command, replacing the &lt;dbid&gt; with the database ID
   found in step 1:
<P>
<P><PRE>      dbcc log(&lt;dbid&gt;,0,0,0,-1,17,0)
      go
</PRE><P>
   This will print out the last checkpoint written to syslogs. Find the
   section that looks like "active xacts:(449, 14)". This is the page and
   row number of the oldest open transaction. Although it is theoretically
   possible to have about a hundred log rows on a page, if the second
   number is over 40, it is likely there are no open transactions.

<P><LI>Now retrieve the begin transaction information:
<P>
<P><PRE>      dbcc log(&lt;dbid&gt;,1,&lt;page&gt;,&lt;row&gt;,0,0,0)
      go
</PRE><P>
   From the example in #2, the command would be (for the pubs database):
<P>
<P><PRE>      dbcc log(4,1,449,14,0,0,0)
      go
</PRE><P>
   If this command prints out no information, or you receive an error such
   as:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Invalid transaction id: 449,14
</PRE><P>
   then, it is possible that there are no active transactions. The field of
   interest here is the "spid=&lt;number&gt;". This is the spid (as seen in
   sp_who) of the process that created this transaction.

<P><LI>You should now confirm that there is an open transaction. The following
   command will try to retrieve the end of the transaction:
<P>
<P><PRE>      dbcc log(&lt;dbid&gt;,1,&lt;page&gt;,&lt;row&gt;,0,30,0)
      go
</PRE><P>
   If this command does not return any information, then you have found the
   oldest open transaction. You can identify the user by running sp_who and
   matching the "spid" values from #3 and sp_who. If it does return
   information about the end of the transaction, follow this procedure one
   more time to ensure that the values were input correctly.

<P><LI>The last bit of information is to determine if the log has been
   truncated up to the oldest transaction.  Run the following command:
<P>
<P><PRE>      select first from sysindexes where id = 8
      go
</PRE><P>
   If the value for first is the same as the page number from step #2, then
   the log is truncated as small as it can go until the transaction is
   committed or aborted.
