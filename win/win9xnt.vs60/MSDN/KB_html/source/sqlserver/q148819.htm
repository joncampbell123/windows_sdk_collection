<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SQL Server, versions 6.0 and 6.5
</UL> 
BUG #: 13700 (Windows NT: 6.5)
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you set up a FOREIGN KEY constraint to reference a table that is
populated by replication (that is, a subscribed table), a constraint
violation may occur if an UPDATE is run against the published table.
This will cause the distribution task to fail with the following error:
<P>
<PRE>   Msg 547, %s statement conflicted with %s constraint '%.*s'. The conflict
   occurred in database '%.*s', table '%.*s'%s%.*s%s

</PRE>The NOT FOR REPLICATION option should allow changes submitted by the
Distribution task on columns referenced by a FOREIGN KEY constraint from
another table that otherwise would violate the constraint.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Change your UPDATE statement to run as an "on-page delete/insert." For
additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../sqlserver/q135871.htm">Q135871</A></B>
   TITLE     : INF: Update Methods Used in SQL Server 6.0

</PRE>If you cannot change your UPDATE statement to meet this criteria, you may
not be able to create a FOREIGN KEY constraint in the subscribed database
to reference a subscribed table.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SQL Server
version 6.5. This problem has been corrected in U.S. Service Pack 2 for
Microsoft SQL Server version 6.5. For more information, contact your
primary support provider.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This problem will occur if the UPDATE on the published table is processed
as a "deferred" or "full delete/insert" UPDATE statement. For additional
information about determining what type of UPDATE statement is being
processed, please see the Microsoft Knowledge Base article listed above.
<P>
SQL Server Replication will generate all statements to be sent to
subscribers based on what is recorded in the transaction log of the
published database. In the case of a "deferred" or "full delete/insert"
UPDATE statement, the transaction log contains a series of DELETE and
INSERT statements combined into one logical transaction. The entries for
these commands appear in the MSjob_commands table in the distribution
database as a series of DELETE statements, followed by INSERT statements,
depending on the number of rows affected by the UPDATE. For example, a
deferred UPDATE that affects 100 rows will result in 200 rows in the
MSjob_commands table for that job.
<P>
Please note that the Microsoft SQL Server Transact-SQL Reference guide (in
the UPDATE statement section) states that an UPDATE can never be "in-place"
against a published table. However, it is still possible for it to be an
"on-page delete/insert," which is considered a "direct" update. For
additional information, please see the Microsoft Knowledge Base article
listed above.
