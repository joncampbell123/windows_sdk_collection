<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft SQL Server allows the use of up to 2048 MB of virtual memory.
This article discusses how much memory you should allocate to SQL Server in
various machine memory configurations.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Windows NT provides each 32-bit Windows application a 4-gigabyte (GB)
virtual address space, the lower 2 GB of which is private per process and
available for application use. The upper 2 GB is reserved for system use.
<P>
The 4-GB address space is mapped to the available physical memory by the
Windows NT Virtual Memory Manager (VMM). The available physical memory can
be up to 4 GB, depending on hardware platform support.
<P>
A 32-bit Windows application such as SQL Server only perceives virtual or
logical addresses, not physical addresses. How much physical memory an
application uses at a given time (the working set) is determined by
available physical memory and the VMM. The application cannot directly
control memory residency.
<P>
Virtual address systems such as Windows NT allow the over-committing of
physical memory, such that the ratio of virtual to physical memory exceeds
1:1. As a result, larger programs can run on machines with a variety of
physical memory configurations. However, in most cases, using significantly
more virtual memory than the combined average working sets of all the
processes will result in poor performance.
<P>
Thus, configuring SQL Server for more virtual memory than the amount of
physical memory that exists can result in poor performance. Also, the
Windows NT operating system memory requirement must be considered--about 12
MB with some variation depending on application-induced overhead. Note that
as SQL Server parameters are configured upward, this system overhead
requirement can grow as Windows NT needs more resident memory to support
additional threads, page tables, and so forth.
<P>
This results in a varying amount of memory that can be given to SQL Server
depending on the machine memory configuration. The following table presents
a rough estimate of memory configurations and assumes a dedicated database
server. If the machine is shared among multiple uses such as a file server,
database server, and/or a client workstation, less memory should be given
to SQL Server and more left for the operating system and other uses.
<P>
Note these values are only rough figures, and are presented to give an
approximate idea of SQL Server memory allocation over different memory
states. For more information you can use the many monitoring features of
Windows NT Performance Monitor (Perfmon) to determine your system memory
behavior. A good source of information is Volume 3 of the Windows NT
Resource Kit, "Optimizing Windows NT," by Russ Blake, [ISBN 1-55615-619-7],
which devotes nearly 600 pages to various aspects of monitoring and
optimizing Windows NT and 32-bit Windows applications.

     24 MB                       8 MB

</PRE>16 megabytes (MB) is the minimum available memory for a machine on which
SQL Server for x86 processors can run. SQL Server for RISC platforms will
require more memory because of the average lower density of RISC machine
instructions. However, considering the overall software, hardware,
application, and personnel investment in typical client/server systems,
adding more memory is usually a wise, and by comparison, inexpensive
investment. Many sites report that 32 MB is a good starting point, and it
is not uncommon for servers to be configured for 128 MB or more memory,
which they put to beneficial use.
<P>
The point at which additional memory fails to provide worthwhile benefits
is entirely situation-dependent, and is determined primarily by the
locality of reference of the database accesses. The important point to
remember is that memory increases that are relatively small as a percentage
of total memory rarely afford any significant benefit. Two things control
this: SQL Server uses extra memory primarily as buffer cache; and most
cache hit ratio studies indicate a fairly flat curve beyond several
megabytes.
<P>
For this reason, on a 32-MB machine, whether 14 MB, 16 MB, or 18 MB is
given to SQL Server, it will rarely make a significant difference in SQL
performance. Conversely, attempting to "crowd" Windows NT by giving
excessive memory to SQL Server can result in poor performance because of
excessive paging.
<P>
The implication is that you should add physical memory to the machine in
significant amounts before allocating this to SQL Server. Whether or not
adding memory will be beneficial should be studied beforehand. The easiest
way to determine this is by using Perfmon to check the SQL Server cache hit
ratio while the system is under a typical load. If the hit ratio is
relatively high (over 90%), adding more memory usually will not be
beneficial. This is because additional memory can mainly be used for
additional SQL Server data cache, thereby increasing the hit ratio. In this
case, the hit ratio is already high, and the maximum available improvement
quite small.
<P>
If the hit ratio is consistently lower than this, adding more memory may
improve the hit ratio and thereby performance, if the locality of reference
is such that it can be "bracketed" by economically or technically feasible
amounts of memory.
