The information in this article applies to:
<P>
<PRE>  - Microsoft SQL Server, version 4.21a
</PRE> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The purpose of this article is to explore various hardware problems related
to Microsoft SQL Server's use of attached tape devices. A basic review of
the database dump and load process will provide a general frame of
reference to the actual operation that reads or writes from/to the tape
device. The review of these operations is not intended to explain the
entire process, only to provide a common framework for exploring the
subsequent SQL Server tape issues.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
SQL Server provides the ability to write database pages to a database dump
device defined in master..sysdevices. The process that manages the load or
dump of database pages is shielded from the actual definition and operation
of the defined dump/load device. All that is required by either a dump or
load process is that the device be valid and accessible via the WIN32 API.
The WIN32 API call that exposes all hardware devices to SQL Server for the
purpose of dump/load is CreateFile() (see the WIN32 API Reference for
details). A successful return from this function call is a 'handle' to the
device, that can be referenced by SQL Server. This handle can be to a
floppy disk, a file on a hard disk, or a tape drive.
<P>
The actual activity of writing to the 'dump' device is commonly referred to
as a 'database dump' or backup. The term 'dump' is probably more meaningful
and not as easily confused with 'backup.' The term 'backup' can just as
easily refer to the writing of files to tape by NTBACKUP.EXE as well as
pages written from a database to tape; both operations perform a backup of
sorts. For the sake of consistency, database dump/load or dump/load will be
used for the remainder of this document when referencing the act of
reading/writing database pages from/to a dump device.
<P>
The database dump procedure is fairly straight forward. The database to be
dumped is opened. A header is generated for the database dump and written
to the selected device. All pages not actually in buffer cache are written
to the defined device. These cached pages are skipped and tracked by SQL
Server in the form of an 'Out of Sequence' queue. Pages that have not been
allocated to an object in the database are skipped completely. After the
allocated pages are written, the 'Out of Sequence' queue is traversed and
referenced pages are written out to the dump device. A trailer is
generated for the dump itself, and is written to the device, and the device
is then closed.
<P>
The load process is initially very similar to the dump process. A valid
<PRE>'handle' must be obtained and the device opened. Once opened, the
</PRE>information contained on the physical medium is transferred to SQL Server.
SQL Server then writes the information page by page into the target
database. After all the pages from the dump device have been transferred,
the remaining 'missing' pages in the database are created and initialized.
The final step taken by SQL Server is to recover the database. This is the
same process that SQL Server uses when it recovers a database on startup.
It is possible that uncommitted transactions are rolled back and committed
transactions rolled forward.
<P>
This is the basic process at the server, however, a interface must be
exposed so that information can be exchanged between the client and the
server. This interface is not required for database dumps/loads to/from
hard disk devices, but is very important for removable media such as tape
and floppy disks. The comments in the following paragraphs are directed
towards these removable media operations.
<P>
There are several methods that SQL Server uses to communicate with the
spid (server process id) that initiated the dump/load process. The oldest
method of communicating with SQL Server for floppy disk and tape
dumps/loads, and one that this common to both SQL Server for OS/2 and SQL
Server, is by using the CONSOLE.EXE. Running CONSOLE.EXE provides a link to
SQL Server by allowing communication with a special 'console' thread which
is spawned as SQL Server starts up. This interface allows information to
pass between the client and SQL Server during database loads or dumps, via
tape or floppy disk (See the "Transact-SQL Reference Guide," Utilities
chapter for details). However, the most flexible and user friendly tool for
the dump/load process is provided through SQL Administrator.
<P>
SQL Administrator is a WIN32 or WIN16 graphical user interface (GUI)
application, which provides a Windows environment facilitating
communication to SQL Server for all types of database dumps/loads. Tape and
floppy disk dumps are handled somewhat differently, because there is an
interface between SQL Administrator and SQL Server provided by SQL Monitor.
Any time dumps/loads are initiated by SQL Administrator, a connection to
SQL Monitor is made, which subsequently connects to the console thread
(this is the same thread that is exposed by CONSOLE.EXE). All prompts and
errors are passed from the Server, via the console thread, to SQL Monitor
which then passes them back to SQL Administrator or display/response.
<P>
The batch mode database dump is performed when SQL Server determines that
there is no interface to the console thread and the operation is a tape
dump or load (floppy disk dumps/loads require the console program or SQL
Administrator). This mode of operation will provide prompts back to the
client process that initiated the dump or load operation. Most of this type
of processing is facilitated by ISQL.EXE, and there is no capability for
the user/client process to respond to messages from the server. This method
depends heavily on Registry entries for handling the tape drive, which are
visible in SQL Setup by clicking the Options, Set Server Options, Tape
Support button. This entry will determine how long SQL Server will wait
and how often SQL Server will poll for a tape while in batch mode. (See the
SQL Server "Configuration Guide" for more information.)
<P>
As stated initially, the purpose of this article is to attempt to shed some
light on the common hardware errors seen in the SQL Server Errorlog and in
the Windows NT Event Viewer's Application Log (NOTE: this article will use
the SQL Server Errorlog rather than the Event Viewer's Application Log for
consistency) that involve the actual process of interfacing with the tape
drive. There are four main activities related to the use of the tape device
and SQL Server: opening the device, reading or writing from/to the device,
and closing the device. It is possible to receive errors from any one of
these operations.
<P>
A general synopsis of the typical database dump/write to tape from SQL
Server would be as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   Open the tape device
   Write the Volume Label
   Write the first Header
   Write the second Header
   Write a supported tape mark
   Write the pages from the database
   Write a supported tape mark
   Write the first End of File Trailer
   Write the second End of File Trailer
   Write the final supported tape mark
   Close the tape device

</PRE>A load/read operation would proceed as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   Open the tape device
   Read the Volume header
   Read the first Header
   Read the second Header
   Position the tape at the next supported tape mark
   Read the database pages from the tape
   Stop when the next supported tape mark is encountered
   Read the first End of File trailer
   Read the second End of File trailer
   Close the tape device

</PRE>It is possible to receive errors from any of the above steps. There are two
types of errors that are generated. The first is the error that is sent to
the client generating the operation. The second error is what is typically
seen in the SQL Server Errorlog and the Application Log in the Windows NT
Event Viewer. The client errors will be examined first.
<P>
The typical error that may be seen by the client will be one or more of the
following:
<P>
<PRE>   Msg    Severity    Text
   ----   --------    ------
   4027   16          Mount first tape for %s of database %s

</PRE>This is essentially a prompt for a new tape; typically, this error is not
seen when a database was dumped via the batch mode operation that was
available in SQL Server 4.21.
<P>
<PRE>   4028   10         End of tape has been reached, remove tape %s and mount
                     next tape for %s of database %s

</PRE>This is essentially a prompt for a new tape, typically this error is not
seen when a database was dumped via the batch mode operation that was
available in SQL Server 4.21.
<P>
<PRE>   4029   10         Database %s%s(%d pages) dumped to file &lt;%d&gt; on tape
                     %s.

</PRE>This message is sent to the client on successful completion of a
database dump.
<P>
<PRE>   4030   16         Tape %s expires on day %s year %s and cannot be
                     overwritten

</PRE>This message is sent to the client when the tape volume information
indicates that the volume has not expired. This message is typically seen
when an operation to initialize a tape prior to a log or database dump is
issued.
<P>
<PRE>   4031   16        Creation date on tape %s(%s) does not match that of
                    first volume(%s)

</PRE>This message is seen when the second tape of a multi-volume tape set has a
creation date different from the initial tape. This is typically seen when
the tapes are mislabeled and an incorrect tape is inserted after a prompt.
<P>
<PRE>   4032   16        Cannot find file %d on tape %s

</PRE>This error is generally seen when on a load operation a file number is
specified and was not found with a scan of the tape. The error can also
occur with multi-volume operations.
<P>
<PRE>   4033   16      File &lt;%d&gt; on tape %s is not a SQL Server %s dump

</PRE>This message is typically seen on a tape where the volume header cannot be
read.
<P>
<PRE>   4034   16      Warning, file &lt;%d&gt; on tape %s was dumped from database %s

</PRE>This message is a caution, to warn the user that the database name listed
in the header is not the same as the database that will be loaded into.
<P>
Other client related errors that will not be covered here are in the range
of SQL Server Messages between message numbers 3201 and 3209. These
particular errors are frequently seen by the client and are generated by
the next level up in the process for Database/Log dumps and loads.
<P>
The second class of errors, are those that are generally seen in the SQL
Server Errorlog and in the Application Log of the Windows NT Event Viewer.
These errors report problems that occur between the Operating System and
SQL Server. This interface also dictates the type of information that is
presented in the Errorlog; the messages generally consist of an error
source, (for example, tbsopen, tbswritecheck,... and so forth), the error
message, and the operating system error if appropriate.
<P>
What follows is a short description of the tape class of error and what
operation was probably occurring at the time that the error was generated.
The follow is a list of errors by category and examples from reported
problems. Additionally, other errors that may be seen are listed as well.
<P>
TBSOPEN
Example:
<PRE>   No errors seen

</PRE>Additional Information or Resolution:
<PRE>   None

</PRE>Possible Errors:
a)  Backup device id is out of range.
b) Backup device is not active.
c) It is possible to see other errors associated with TBSCHGTAPES.
<P>
TBSCLOSE
Example:
<PRE>   No errors seen

</PRE>Additional Information or Resolution:
<PRE>   None

</PRE>Possible Errors:
a) Backup device failed to close, operating system error.
b) It is possible to see other errors associated with TBSCHGTAPES,
TPWTRLS, and TBSWRITEFLUSH.
<P>
TBSWRITE
Example:
<PRE>   No errors seen

</PRE>Additional Information or Resolution:
<PRE>   None

</PRE>Possible Errors:
a) It is possible to see errors associated with TBSCHGTAPES and
TBSWRITEFLUSH.
<P>
TBSWRITEFLUSH
Example:
<P>
kernel  tbswriteflush: Write failure on backup device \\.\tape0,
<PRE>   returned operating system error 6(the handle is invalid)

</PRE>Additional Information or Resolution:
- The above error was generated due to a time-out issue where a tape
inserted
<P>
into the tape drive on a multi-volume database dump failed.
<P>
Possible Errors:
a) Warning: the tape used is not a recommended computer grade tape and
cannot
<P>
be used for multivolume dumps.  Also, Not enough space is left in the
device to
initiate this dump.
b) Failure on backup device returned operating system error.
c) Number of bytes written did not match request.
d) Other errors may be present from TBSCHGTAPES
<P>
TBSREAD
Example:
<PRE>   No errors seen

</PRE>Additional Information or Resolution:
<PRE>   None

</PRE>Possible Errors:
a) May see associated errors from TBSCHGTAPES and TBSREADFLUSH.
<P>
TBSREADFLUSH
Example:
<P>
<PRE>kernel    tbsreadflush: Read failure on backup device '\\.\TAPE0',
   returned operating system error 1117(The request
   could not be performed because of an I/O device error).

</PRE>Additional Information or Resolution:
An event id number 11 was found in the Event Viewer, System Log with
the above error, providing the additional description "Driver detected
a controller error." The problem was resolved by correcting the underlying
problem related to the cabling, terminator and SCSI controller.
<P>
- This error may also be associated with a tbsreadcheck error, stating
that the device could not be accessed because it was being used by
another process.  If this occurs, terminate the other process.
<P>
Possible Errors:
a) Failed to seek Tape Mark, operating system error.
b) Block count during dump does not match block count during load.
c) Failure on backup device returned operating system error.
d) May be associated with errors from TPRTRLS and TBSCHGTAPES.
<P>
TBSCHGTAPES
Example:
<PRE>   No errors seen

</PRE>Additional Information or Resolution:
<PRE>   None

</PRE>Possible Errors:
a) May be associated with errors from TBSWRITECHECK or TBSREADCHECK.
<P>
TBSREADCHECK
Example:
<P>
<PRE>kernel   tprhdrs: failed to seek Tape Mark, operating system error :
   1(Incorrect function.)
kernel   tbsreadcheck: Tape rejected

kernel   tprvol: Read returned 87, the parameter is invalid reading
   volume header
kernel   tbsreadcheck: tape rejected.

</PRE>Additional Information or Resolution:
- The first example above has been associated with a tape drive supporting
setmarks, which has been disabled by another tape related application.
The particular function disabled is reportsetmarks.  If the tape drive
is external, it is possible to reset it by a power off/on cycle.  If it
is internal a power off/on of the server will reset the device so that
the reportsetmarks are enabled (this generally is the default for most
devices).  Contact your support vendor for assistance with the problem.
<P>
- The second example occurred on a MIPS system and was resolved by
upgrading to 4.21a.
<P>
Possible Errors:
a) Backup device failed to open, operating system error.
b) Tape rejected.
c) Incorrect file indicator specified for tape device, Cannot find
file on tape.
d) Volume 'X' has been loaded instead of Volume 'Y' for the current file.
e) Not a valid tape and Header labels of rejected tape.
f) Bad block length.
g) Cannot allocate byte I/O buffer.
h) May be associated with errors from CHECKTAPEINFO, TPRVOL and TPRHDRS.
<P>
TBSWRITECHECK
Example:
<P>
<PRE>kernel    tbswritecheck: Backup device '\\.\Tape0' failed to open.
   Operating system error = 2 (The system can not
   find the file specified.)

</PRE>kernel  tbswritecheck: Backup device '\\.\TAPE0' failed to open,
<PRE>   operating system error = 32(The process cannot
   access the file because it is being used by
   another process.)

kernel   tbswritecheck: Seek operation in backup device '(null)'
        returned operating system error =

kernel   tbswritecheck: not enough space is left in the device to
        initiate this dump.

</PRE>Additional Information or Resolution:
- The tape device was not created correctly and when SQL Server attempted
to
<P>
open the device the error was returned.  Problem was resolved by correcting
the setup for the tape device.
<P>
- The second example occurred due to a previous call to open the specified
tape device.  Tape devices cannot be shared between processes.
<P>
- The third example was resolved by cleaning the tape drive and using a
different brand of tape.
<P>
- The fourth example was an error generated by a tape device that was
not on the Windows NT Hardware compatibility list.
<P>
Possible Errors:
a) Cannot find date using null dates in tape labels.
b) Backup device failed to open operating system error.
c) Not enough space is left in the device to initiate this dump.
d) Seek operation in backup device returned operating system error.
e) Incorrect file indicator specified for tape device, cannot find
file on tape.
f) Tape rejected.
g) May be associated with errors from CHECKTAPEINFO, TPRTRLS, TPRHDRS
and TPWVOL.
<P>
CHECKTAPEINFO
Example:
<PRE>kernel   checktapeinfo: error getting media information for device
   '\\.\Tape0', OS error:(null)

kernel    checktapeinfo: Unable to load tape into the tape drive,
   OS Error 121 (the semaphore time-out period has expired)

</PRE>kernel  checktapeinfo: Unable to load tape into the tape drive: OS
<PRE>   Error : 1112(No media in drive.)

</PRE>kernel  checktapeinfo: cannot write on a write protected tape
<P>
Additional Information or Resolution:
- This error was generated by a device that was not on the Windows NT
Hardwar
e
compatibility list.  The problem is that when the tape drive was
interrogated
<P>
for it's firmware capabilities it did not response appropriately.
<P>
- The second error was due to a faulty tape drive, the drive was replaced
wit
h
an identical make/model and the error did not reoccur.
<P>
- The third error is as simple as it seems, a pending tape operation and
when interrogated, the device responds that there is indeed no tape in the
drive.
<P>
<P>
- This fourth error is also as obvious as the previous error.  The tape
was ejected and replaced.
<P>
Possible Errors:
a) Unable to load tape into the tape drive, OS Error.
b) Error getting media Information for device, OS Error.
c) Device or Media does not support '_'.
d) Cannot write on a write protected tape.
<P>
TPRHDRS
Example:
<P>
<PRE>kernel   tprhdrs: failed to seek Tape Mark, operating system error :
     (Incorrect function.)
kernel   tbsreadcheck: Tape rejected

</PRE>Additional Information or Resolution:
- The error list above has been reported on two different occasions, the
first was generated on a MIPS server, the original problem has been
corrected with version 4.21a SQL Server.
<P>
- The second problem is related to the problem noted under tbsreadcheck,
same issue an attempt to find a supported tape mark, but was unable to
due to the disabling of the tape drive reportsetmarks.
<P>
Possible Errors:
a) Read returned 'X' reading first file header.
b) Label not found.
c) Read returned 'X' reading second file header.
d) Failed to seek Tape mark, operating system error.
<P>
TPRTLS
Example:
<PRE>   No errors seen

</PRE>Additional Information or Resolution:
<PRE>   None

</PRE>Possible Errors:
a) Failed to seek Tape mark, operating system error.
b) Read of first trailer failed.
b) Read of second trailer failed.
<P>
TPWHDRS
Example:
<PRE>   No errors seen

</PRE>Additional Information or Resolution:
<PRE>   None

</PRE>Possible Errors:
a) Warning: the tape used is not a recommended computer grade tape and
cannot be used for multi-volume dumps.
b) Not enough space is left in the device to initiate this dump.
<P>
TPWTRLS
Example:
<PRE>   No errors seen

</PRE>Additional Information or Resolution:
<PRE>   None

</PRE>Possible Errors:
a) Warning: the tape used is not a recommended computer grade tape and
cannot be used for multi-volume dumps.
<P>
TPRVOL
Example:
<PRE>   No errors seen

</PRE>Additional Information or Resolution:
<PRE>   None

</PRE>Possible Errors:
a) Seek operation in backup device returned operating system error.
b) Read returned 'X' reading volume header
c) VOL1 Label not found.
<P>
TPWVOL
Example:
<PRE>kernel   tpwvol: Seek operation in backup device failed returned OS
   Error 1117 (The request could not be performed because of an
   I/O device error.)

</PRE>Additional Information or Resolution:
- The above problem occurred due to a device/controller problem.  The tape
device was replaced.
<P>
Possible Problems:
a) Seek operation in backup device returned operating system error.
<P>
The information listed above is certainly not an exhaustive list of tape
related problems, but it does serve to illustrate the variety of problems
that may be encountered with tape devices. The best method to protect
corporate resources is to verify that the device chosen is on the Windows
NT Hardware Compatibility List for the version of Windows NT that is being
used. Review the documentation that is included with the tape device and
the SCSI controller to ensure that it is set up properly. Test the device
with the application software that will be used routinely, and if there is
more than one application, verify that they can successfully coexist.
