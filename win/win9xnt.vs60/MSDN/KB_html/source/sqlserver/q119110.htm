<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
It is common to encounter situations where you need to verify whether two
disk files are identical. For example, you may observe unusual program
behavior and suspect the file is damaged. Or two files may have the same
byte count but different dates, and you wish to be certain they are
identical. You may also be sending files to someone and prior to sending
you wish to verify them against a master copy. In some cases, these files
may be readable ASCII, and in other cases, binary. Sometimes you may need
to compare a local file to a questionable file at a remote site.
<P>
The only way to positively verify the files are identical is by using the
techniques listed here or similar ones. The file-byte count and creation
date are not reliable indications.
<P>
If a file is suspect, often the solution taken is to recopy from a known
good file. This may solve the problem but prevents ever knowing for certain
whether the original file was damaged. It can be important to determine
this, as the file damage can indicate an underlying network or system
problem. This article discusses how to compare files using utilities that
are either commonly available or part of Windows NT and the Windows NT
Resource Kit.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
For comparing a local file to a remote file, it is often best to use the
pkzip utility. Pkzip the file at both the local and remote sites. Then use
pkzip -v to examine the CRC-32 value for the ZIP files. If the CRC-32
values are identical for the remote and local sites, then the files are
absolutely identical. Since ZIPing a large file can take some time, it is
often best to use the pkzip -e0 (no compression) option, which is fastest.
<P>
If a file is ZIPed with PKZIP before sending to a remote site, the embedded
CRC-32 will ensure notification if the file is damaged in transit. This
will be seen as an error during the unzip process. If there is no error,
the file was conveyed without damage.
<P>
For comparing two files or groups of files at a local site, there are
several options: The FC.EXE and COMP.EXE comparison utilities both ship
with Windows NT. WINDIFF.EXE ships with the Windows NT Resource Kit. FC.EXE
is good for comparing two ASCII or binary files and has several different
parameters. For example, use FC /b to compare two binary files.
<P>
COMP.EXE can be used to compare groups of files in two different
directories. For example,
<P>
<PRE>   COMP c:\winnt\system32\*.dll \\remotesys\c$\winnt\system32\*.dll

</PRE>compares all DLLs in the indicated directories on two different machines.
<P>
If you need to compare entire subdirectory trees, the WINDIFF utility from
the Windows NT Resource Kit can be used. WINDIFF is a graphical Win32
utility. It is also excellent for doing detailed comparison between two
ASCII files, such as source code. It graphically illustrates with colors
the difference between the two ASCII files.
