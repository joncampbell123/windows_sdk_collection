<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
SQL Server 6.5 and 6.0 Service Pack 3 allow processes to continue
requesting page locks if a request to escalate to a table lock is blocked.
With earlier versions of SQL Server, applications that had to wait for the
escalated lock could have encountered a deadlock situation. This change has
considerably reduced the number of deadlocks encountered between the
LogReader and Distribution tasks for SQL Server replication, but it can
also help out any other application that encounters deadlocks caused by
table lock escalation situations.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In SQL Server 6.0, 6.0 Service Pack 1, and 6.0 Service Pack2, a process
would block on a request for an escalation to a table lock if the request
for a table lock would cause the process to be blocked. In some situations,
this could have resulted in a deadlock situation, and one of the processes
would encounter the following error (based on the standard rules for
deadlock victim processing):
<P>
<PRE>   Msg 1205, "Your server command (process id#%d) was deadlocked with
   another process and has been chosen as deadlock victim. Re-run your
   command."

</PRE>In SQL Server 6.0 Service Pack 3 and SQL Server 6.5, the lock manager has
been changed to continue requesting page locks if a table lock escalation
would be blocked. The server continues to attempt to escalate to a table
lock as long as new page locks are needed. This way, a normal lock
escalation can occur once the other process frees its locks.
<P>
See the SQL documentation in the "Administrator's Companion" for more
details about lock types and configuration values to control lock
escalations.
