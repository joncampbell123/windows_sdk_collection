<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article discusses the steps you should take to address the most
common causes of Microsoft Access conformance errors raised from the
Microsoft SQL Server ODBC driver.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Access makes heavy use of the ODBC catalog API functions to
determine the capabilities of the ODBC drivers to which it connects and the
structure of attached external tables. If the values returned on these
calls to catalog functions are not exactly those expected by Access, Access
raises a conformance error:
<P>
<PRE>   ODBC specification conformance error (-77xx), this error
   should be reported to the ODBC driver vendor

</PRE>All Access errors in the 7700s are conformance errors. The Microsoft
whitepaper "Jet Database Engine ODBC Connectivity" (available on the MSDN
and TechNet CDs) contains a list of the conformance errors and the
specific check which leads to the error.
<P>
Conformance errors encountered with the Microsoft SQL Server ODBC driver
rarely indicate a problem with the driver itself. Because Access strictly
checks the values returned from the ODBC catalog functions, any problems in
the environment can raise conformance errors. For example, if there is a
problem in the underlying network that raises a network error on a catalog
API call from Access, Access will report this as a conformance error
because it did not get the answer it expected.
<P>
If you get conformance errors from the Microsoft ODBC SQL Server driver,
you should check the following:

<OL><P><LI>The most common cause of conformance errors is that the driver is being
   run against a server which does not have the proper version of the SQL
   Server system catalog stored procedures. To correct this, the DBA should
   run the INSTCAT.SQL script associated with the latest version of the
   driver being used against the server. For example, if both clients using
   the 2.00.1912 driver (which shipped with SQL Server version 4.21a) and
   the 2.50.0121 driver (which shipped with SQL Server version 6.0) are
   being run against a server, then the INSTCAT.SQL that shipped with SQL
   Server 6.0 and the 2.50.0121 driver should be run against that server.
   The INSTCAT.SQLs are backwards compatible, so you can run the version
   6.0 INSTCAT.SQL into a version 4.21a server and still access that server
   with 2.00.1912 drivers.

<P><LI>If the conformance errors are related to a specific table or group of
   tables, there may be a problem with the table. Run the following dbcc
   commands in SQL Server, and address any errors as directed in the SQL
   Server 6.0 "Administrator's Companion" or the SQL Server 4.21a
   "Troubleshooting Guide":
<P>
   DBCC CHECKTABLE(problem_table)
   DBCC CHECKCATALOG

<P><LI>Older versions of the Jet Database Engine in Access 2.0 are more prone
   to generating this conformance error message with SQL Server drivers.
   Check the version of the MSAJT200.DLL module by selecting the module in
   File Manager, then pressing ALT+ENTER. If the version number is earlier
   than 2.50.1606, see Knowledge Base Article <B><A href="../access/q122927.htm">Q122927</A></B> for instructions on
   getting the Access 2.0 Service Pack.

<P><LI>Check the general connectivity from the client to the SQL Server. Make
   sure that the SQL Server client utilities such as ISQL/w can
   successfully connect. Follow the connectivity troubleshooting steps
   outlined in the section 'Isolating Connection Problems' of either the
   SQL Server 6.0 "Administrator's Companion" or the SQL Server 4.21a
   "Troubleshooting Guide."

<P><LI>If the ODBC SDK is installed on the client, rerun the steps that
   generate the Access conformance error while spying on the ODBC data
   source with the ODBCSpy utility. You should be able to see the specific
   ODBC error causing the conformance error captured in a call to the
   SQLError ODBC function. Also, the particular ODBC API function which
   raises the specific conformance error reported by Access can be
   determined from the list of specification errors in the "Jet Database
   Engine ODBC Connectivity" whitepaper. A user can then search the spy
   trace for that particular function and see if there was an error
   associated with it.
