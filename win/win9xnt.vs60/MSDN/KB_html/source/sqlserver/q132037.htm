The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SQL Server, version 6.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft SQL Server version 6.0 has implemented server cursors and a user
controllable setting for TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL. When used together,
it can be useful to know the expected locking behavior.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This document attempts to clarify the effect of optimizer hints and
isolation levels on the locking considerations of cursors. The nonlocking
parts of optimizer hints affect the cursor behavior in the following ways:

<UL><LI>INDEX = index_name: If the given index is unique, then this index
   will be used as the primary keyset for the given table. If the index
   is not unique, then this optimizer hint will be ignored.
<P>
   NOTE: Use of this option may cause dynamic cursors to convert to keyset
   based cursors if the index chosen does not match the 'ORDER BY' columns
   in the cursor statement exactly.

<LI>FASTFIRSTROW: Dynamic cursors will always use this option whenever
   the primary keyset values chosen is from a nonclustered index. For
   keyset based cursors this option will be honored if used in the
   cursor statement, not if not given. The locking related parts of
   optimizer hints and isolation levels will affect cursor locking
   behavior as follows:

<LI>All exclusive locks and table locks (TABLOCK and TABLOCKX) are
   taken and maintained inside a user transaction. These are held as
   long as the transaction is open (even if the cursor closes) and
   released when the transaction ends. If there are no transactions
   outstanding the TABLOCKX and TABLOCK options will only have read
   duration, i.e. the table lock will be taken while the rows are being
   read and released immediately as soon as the read is complete.

<LI>The isolation level at the time of cursor declare will be in effect
   throughout the cursor. Changes made to the isolation level after the
   cursor is declared will not affect the locking behavior.

<LI>The PAGELOCK keyword is ignored in cursor declare statements.

<LI>If a certain optimizer locking hint is used for a given table in a
   cursor statement, it will override isolation level and cursor
   concurrency option for that table. For example you can open a cursor
   with the LOCKCC option and specify NOLOCK option on one of the tables
   participating in the cursor select statement. This will cause that
   table to be read uncommitted (with no locks) while other tables are
   protected by update locks.

<LI>No data modifications (update, delete, insert) can be made to
   tables that have the NOLOCK optimizer hint.

<LI>If no optimizer locking hint is used, the isolation level locking
   will take effect on the cursor if the cursor is opened with OPTCC,
   OPTCCVAL, or READONLY concurrency options. If the cursor is opened
   with the LOCKCC option, this option will override isolation level
   locking.

<LI>OPTCC, OPTVAL, and LOCKCC concurrency options are disallowed in
   cursors when isolation level is 0. Also UPDLOCK and TABLOCKX keywords
   are disallowed as optimizer hints when at this isolation level.

<LI>If isolation level is 0 during cursor declaration, ANSI cursors
   will be opened READ ONLY. Extended procedure cursors will fail to
   open unless READ ONLY option is specified.
<P>
</UL>The following page gives a detailed table of the kinds of locks taken with
various hints and isolation levels. Some of the shorthand terminology is
explained below:
<P>
RDL - Read locks: These are shared page locks that are taken while
the pages are being read and released immediately after the page read
is complete.
<P>
SCR -Scroll locks: These locks are taken by the cursor fetch command on
pages that the rows are returned from. These locks will remain in place as
long as the last fetch command has rows fetched from these pages; and
released either when a succeeding fetch scrolls off these pages or the
cursor is closed. These locks come in two varieties: shared SCR(sh), and
update SCR(up) page locks. Only the locks on the data pages will be kept,
no locks on the index pages will be taken. Furthermore, if SCROLL locking
is in effect on the cursor (shared or update) and there is an outstanding
transaction in effect during opening of a keyset based cursor, shared locks
will be accumulated on pages generating the keyset and these locks will be
kept until the transaction ends.
<P>
XT/C Locks: These page locks are taken by the cursor fetch command
on pages that the rows are returned from. If a transaction is
outstanding, these locks will be kept within the duration of the
transaction and released when the transaction commits or rolls back.
If there are no transactions, these locks will be kept as long as the
cursor is open, or a new transaction is started and then ended. These
locks also have shared and update varieties. XT/C(sh)  and XT/C(up)
for page locks
<P>
XT(tb) and XT(tbx): Shared and exclusive table locks. These locks can
only be taken inside a transaction and can only live within the life
of the transaction, not the cursor.
<P>
The following table attempts to clarify in detail what kind of locks
will be taken with cursors under different locking hints and
optimizer levels:
