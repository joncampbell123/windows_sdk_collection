<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article addresses the interoperability of different SQL Server
versions with respect to SQL Server replication. It also explains the
compatibility issues with the different service packs for SQL Server
versions 6.0 and 6.5. In general, the publication and the distribution
servers must be on the same version and same service pack revision. The
Readme.txt file that accompanies the service packs will also direct you to
apply the service packs on both publication and distribution servers.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
SQL Server version 6.0 introduced replication as a built-in feature of the
product. Since then, it has been enhanced in SQL Server 6.0 service packs
and in the next release of the product, SQL Server 6.5. Due to the various
enhancements, replication-related stored procedures, extended stored
procedures, and tables have been modified. Because the replication tasks
run on the distribution server and depend on the stored procedures and
extended stored procedures on the publication server, the publication and
distribution servers must be running the same version and service pack
revision of SQL Server. Because replication does not use any stored
procedures or extended stored procedures on the subscribing server, the
subscribing server can run the same or any earlier version or service pack
revision of SQL Server.
<P>
<P><h3>SQL Server 6.0 Distribution Server</h3>
 
<P>
The publication server must be running at least SQL Server version 6.0,
and must be running the same service pack revision as the distribution
server. For example, if the distribution server is running SQL Server
version 6.0 Service Pack 3, the publication server must also be running
SQL Server 6.0 Service Pack 3. However, The subscribing server can run SQL
Server 6.0 Service Pack 3 or earlier. Replication to SQL Server version
4.2x, 6.5, or any ODBC data source is not supported with a distribution
server running SQL Server 6.0.
<P>
<P><h3>SQL Server 6.5 Distribution Server</h3>
 
<P>
The publication server must be running at least SQL Server version 6.5
with the same service pack as the distribution server. The subscribing
server can be running any version earlier. For example, if the
distribution server is running SQL Server version 6.5 Service Pack 2, the
publication server must also be running SQL Server 6.5 Service Pack 2;
the subscribing server can be running any earlier version of SQL Server,
including SQL Server 6.0. Replication to SQL Server version 4.2x is not
supported. You can also replicate to ODBC subscribers, as explained in the
product documentation. For more information about how to do this, please
refer to the "Replication to ODBC Subscribers" section of the "What's new
for Administrators" chapter in the "What's New in SQL Server 6.5."
You cannot use a SQL Server 6.5 distribution server for a SQL Server 6.0
publication server.
