<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SQL Server, version 6.5
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Binary File Editor (Editbin.exe) can be used to adjust the
stack size for SQL Server threads, to allow a large memory configuration
for SQL Server on computers that have 2 GB or more of physical RAM.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
As a 32-bit operating system, Windows NT can address a maximum of 4 GB of
virtual memory. Windows NT divides this virtual address range into 2 GB for
user processes and another 2 GB for the system. Thus, SQL Server can
address a maximum of 2 GB of virtual memory (or physical memory if 2 GB or
more is present on the system).
<P>
If you are attempting to maximize the amount of memory allocated to SQL
Server on a system with 2 GB or more of physical memory, you may find that
you are not able to set the SQL Server memory parameter as high as you
expect. For example, setting SQL Server's memory parameter to 900,000 pages
(approximately 1.8 GB) may result in either of the following:

<UL><LI>An error when starting the server:
<P><PRE>      initdata: suballocation for buffer pages failed (x bytes requested).
</PRE><P>
   -or-

<LI>An error when attempting to connect users:
<P><PRE>      Not enough memory for pss allocation.
</PRE><P>
</UL>Both errors are written to the Windows NT event log and the SQL Server
errorlog.
<P>
On initial analysis, it may seem reasonable that you should be able to
allocate 1.8 GB to SQL Server and leave the remaining portion for the
Windows NT system. However, by default, each thread created by SQL Server
is assigned 1 MB of virtual stack space by Windows NT, and this is virtual
memory that is not accounted for in the SQL Server memory configuration
parameter value. If SQL Server is configured to use several hundred worker
threads, a significant amount of virtual memory can be dedicated to thread
stack space, and thus unavailable for either server startup or the dynamic
memory allocation necessary as users connect. For example, 200 worker
threads would consume about 200 MB of virtual memory for stack space alone.
In reality, the bulk of the reserved virtual memory addresses are never
used by the SQL Server threads. However, Windows NT assigns them by default
when SQL Server creates the threads.
<P>
In cases where you have 2 GB or more of physical memory on the system, and
you are attempting to use as much memory as possible for SQL Server (and
for the SQL Server data cache), it is possible to reduce the default thread
virtual stack size, to effectively use these memory addresses. The effect
of reducing the stack size can be seen in increasing the amount of memory
allocated to SQL Server (by increasing the SQL Server memory configuration
parameter, or by simply being able to connect more users without running
out of memory).
<P>
To modify the SQL Server thread stack size, you must use the Microsoft
Binary File Editor (Editbin.exe), included with the Microsoft Visual C++
development environment. The Editbin utility, run from the Windows NT
command prompt, is used to modify object files, executable files, and
dynamic-link libraries (DLLs). For more information on the Editbin utility,
see the Microsoft Visual C++ documentation.
<P>
To decrease the virtual address range dedicated to each Windows NT thread
used by SQL Server, run the following command:
<P>
<PRE>      EDITBIN /STACK:reserve sqlserver.exe

</PRE>This option sets the size of the stack in bytes, where the reserve argument
specifies the total stack allocation in virtual memory for each thread.
Editbin rounds the specified value up to the nearest four bytes. Note that
the optional commit argument is not required when adjusting the thread
stack size for SQL Server. For example, to set the thread stack size for
SQL Server to 64K, you would use the following command in the Mssql\Binn
directory:
<P>
<PRE>      EDITBIN /STACK:65536 sqlservr.exe

</PRE>Be sure to take the following points into consideration before running this
command against Sqlservr.exe:

<UL><LI>Do not run this command unless your system has 2 GB or more of physical
   memory.

<LI>You should make a backup copy of the Sqlservr.exe file before running
   this command.

<LI>You should thoroughly test your application and its interaction with SQL
   Server to observe any performance differences, before making a change
   to the Sqlservr.exe in production.
<P>
</UL>Keep in mind that the amount of thread stack space will vary from
application to application. If you specify a stack size that is too low for
your application, SQL Server will report stack overflow errors.
Unfortunately, there is no easy way to estimate the amount of stack space
necessary. Therefore, it is recommended that the stack space not be set
below 16K. Testing has shown that this amount should be adequate for most
applications.
<P>
To check the current thread stack size, you can use Dumpbin.exe utility
(included with Microsoft Visual C++) to look at the "size of the stack
reserve" value.
<P>
The following command (run from a Windows NT command prompt) provides an
example:
<P>
<PRE>      DUMPBIN /headers sqlservr.exe

</PRE>This command shows the following for "size of stack reserve" for
Sqlservr.exe 6.5 Service Pack1 (Intel), under the heading OPTIONAL HEADER
VALUES:
<P>
<PRE>      100000 size of stack reserve

</PRE>The value is displayed in a hexadecimal format (100,000 = 1,048,576 bytes,
or 1 MB).
<P>
For more information on Dumpbin, see the Microsoft Visual C++
documentation.
