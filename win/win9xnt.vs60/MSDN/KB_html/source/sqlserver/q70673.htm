<UL><LI>Microsoft SQL Server Programmer's Toolkit, version 4.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In a DB-Library (DB-Lib) application that performs SELECT
statements that return large numbers of result rows, the following
procedure is being used to find out how many rows are returned
without processing the entire query.
<P>
If a SELECT statement is performed by calling the DBSQLEXEC() and
DBRESULTS() functions, and then calling the DBCANCEL() function to
cancel the query without processing the rows, a subsequent call to
the DBCOUNT() function returns an incorrect number of rows.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This functionality is not supported by the Microsoft SQL Server and
DB-Library.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
In the case above, the number of rows returned by DBCOUNT() is the
number of rows that were sent to the workstation before the query
was canceled. This also occurs in SAF when the F6 key, which aborts
processing of the query, is pressed before the query completes. A
subsequent "SELECT @@rowcount" shows the number of rows sent to the
workstation before the query was aborted.
<P>
To find the number of rows that would be returned without looping
through each row in a DB-Lib application, issue the command
"SELECT COUNT(*)" with the same WHERE clause as the original SELECT
statement. This command is faster than processing each row, because
only one row is returned from the SQL Server.
