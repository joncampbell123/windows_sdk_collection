<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Version 4.1 of DEC Pathworks for MS-DOS supports LAN Manager Enhanced
workstation functions and hence, named pipes. Therefore, SQL Server on
a Pathworks server can be accessed from an MS-DOS-based Pathworks
version 4.1 workstation.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
DEC Pathworks (previously called PCSA) is an original equipment
manufacturer (OEM) version of LAN Manager. Pathworks allows
MS-DOS-based and OS/2-based workstations to access DECnet and thus
establish a connection to a VAX. (To do this, DECnet's transport-level
protocol stack must be used.) The latest versions of Pathworks are
version 4.1 for MS-DOS and version 2.0 for OS/2. Version 4.0 for
MS-DOS was based on the LAN Manager Basic redirector and thus does not
provide named-pipe support for MS-DOS-based workstations. This means
that MS-DOS-based clients cannot access SQL Server from Pathworks
version 4.0.
<P>
Version 4.1 of Pathworks, which provides named-pipe support, has been
released. This version can run the LAN Manager Enhanced redirector.
There are three different modes of installing a Pathworks 4.1
workstation: Basic, Enhanced, and Enhanced with full LAN Manager
version 2.0 capability. Of these three, only the Enhanced workstation
with full LAN Manager capability provides named-pipe support. When a
workstation is configured in this mode, it can access SQL Server.
