The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SQL Server version 6.5
</UL> 
BUG #: 17507 (6.50)
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Granting logins to members of global groups or expanding a global group in
SQL Security Manager may cause an error message if either of the following
conditions is true:

<UL><LI>The MSSQLServer service account is not a member of the domain that the
   global group belongs to.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>The MSSQLServer service account is not a member of a domain that is
   trusted by the global group's domain.
<P>
</UL>The error message that you receive is:
<P>
<PRE>   Msg No 0,  Severity 1,  State 1
   Unable to successfully query domain controller

</PRE><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, do any one of the following:

<UL><LI>Start the MSSQLServer service as the local system account.

<LI>Start the MSSQLServer service as a domain user account from the global
   group's domain, making sure that the domain user account is also a
   member of the local Administrators group on the SQL Server. However, if
   there are other global groups from other trusted domains, you will not
   be able to see those users unless the domain of the service account is
   trusted by the domains of the other global groups.

<LI>Instead of adding global groups to the local group on the SQL Server,
   add the users from the trusted domain directly to the local group on the
   SQL Server.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SQL Server version 6.5.
A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested
and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem.
Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix.
Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The error occurs when xp_logininfo is called by Security Manager on the
global group. The following is an example of a case where xp_logininfo
fails:

<UL><LI>SQL Server is installed in a resource domain named DomR.

<LI>On the SQL Server, a local group is created named SLocal.

<LI>A global group named SGlobal from a trusted domain named DomT is
   added to SLocal.

<LI>In Security Manager, login permissions are granted for SLocal.
<P>
</UL>When you expand the local group, Security Manager calls xp_logininfo:
<P>
<PRE>   master.dbo.xp_logininfo 'SLocal','members'

</PRE>When you expand the global group, Security Manager again calls
xp_logininfo:
<P>
<PRE>   master.dbo.xp_logininfo 'DomT\SGlobal','members'

</PRE>At this point, you will receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Unable to successfully query domain controller
</PRE>
