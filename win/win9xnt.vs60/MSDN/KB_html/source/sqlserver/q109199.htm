<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
SQL Server version 4.2 for Windows NT or OS/2 does not utilize the double-
byte or Unicode character sets. However, this does not prevent the storing
of a numeric representation of a non-Roman character in a SQL datatype that
is large enough to hold it.
<P>
There are some limitations to storing double-byte characters. One case
would be if the second byte of a double-byte character were to collide with
a special character such as a "%" or "'". With kanji, this would occur for
about 2% of the kanji double-byte characters. Those characters could not be
used for object names and could also cause problems when formulating
Transact-SQL statements. You would also have problems with LIKE--again what
if the second byte of a double-byte were the same numeric representation as
the "%" wildcard used by LIKE.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
For the reasons stated above, to handle dbcs, it is necessary to have the
parser look ahead to see if the character is a single- or double-byte.
