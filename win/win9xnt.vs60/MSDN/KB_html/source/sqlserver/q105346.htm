<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Writing a user-defined dynamic link library (DLL) for Windows to access
DB-Library functions requires special considerations. One consideration
that is specific to DB-Library is that a DLL cannot share DBPROCESS
connections or error and message handlers between applications. This is
because a DLL can be called from many different concurrently running
applications.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
A DLL runs under the context of the program that called it. This is
important because DB-Library tracks data for each active application
separately. This per-process data includes DBPROCESS connections and
pointers to the error and message handlers. DB-Library does this by
registering the calling application's Windows task handle when
dbinit() is called, and uses that to identify all of the DB-Library data
associated with that application. The dbwinexit() function "unregisters"
the application, and de-allocates the data associated with the process.
<P>
In addition, DB-Library for Windows validates each DBPROCESS connection
before using it, using the Windows task handle of the calling application.
<P>
If you try to share a DBPROCESS between multiple applications, the
following occurs:
<P>
- Suppose application APPONE calls your DLL. You do a dbinit(), use
<PRE>  dbopen() to get a DBPROCESS connection, and start accessing SQL
  Server.

</PRE>- Now suppose application APPTWO calls your DLL, and your DLL attempts
<PRE>  to use the same DBPROCESS (the one your DLL got while running under
  APPONE) in a call to dbcmd() or any other DB-Library function.

</PRE>- Since your DLL is running under APPTWO's context, DB-Library will
<PRE>  search for the registration of APPTWO, and not finding it will return
  FAIL.

</PRE>There are many approaches to handling DB-Library calls in a DLL. Some
of the most common are covered below:
<P>
One way is to have each application do its own dbinit() and dbopen(),
register its own error and message handlers, and pass the DBPROCESS
pointer as a parameter to the DLL functions. When the application is
done, it will call dbwinexit().
<P>
A second option is to have each of your DLL's functions call dbinit(),
register the error and message handlers, call dbopen(), use the
DBPROCESS, then call dbwinexit().
<P>
Another option is for your DLL to provide a dll_init() and dll_exit()
function, which are called by each application that wants to use your
DLL. The dll_init() function would call dbinit() and dbopen(), install
the error and message handlers, and return the dbproc to the calling
routine. Then the dll_exit() function would call dbwinexit(). The
calling application would pass back the dbproc on each call to your DLL.
