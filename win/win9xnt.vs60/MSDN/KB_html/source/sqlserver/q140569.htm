<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The DBCC (DataBase Consistency Checker) utilities are a collection of
programs used to verify integrity of a SQL Server database. They are
conceptually similar to file system checking programs such as CHKDSK in MS-
DOS, Windows 95, and Windows NT, and fsck in UNIX. Like file system
checking programs, DBCC can take a significant amount of time to run on
large data sets. This article discusses ways to improve DBCC performance.
References to 6.0 also apply to 6.5 unless otherwise noted.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Overview of DBCC</h3>
 
<P>
Most file systems and database systems provide integrity checking
utilities to periodically verify data structure consistency. For example
the Rdb Management Utility (RMU) performs functions similar to DBCC on the
Oracle Rdb database.
<P>
Integrity checking utilities generally have a long running time when used
on large data sets, and DBCC is no different. However there are several
actions which can maximize the performance and minimize the impact of
DBCC.
<P>
First, a review of the DBCC utilities most commonly used for integrity
checking: NEWALLOC and CHECKTABLE/CHECKDB. CHECKDB performs the same
checks as CHECKTABLE, but for each table in the database in succession.
<P>
NEWALLOC checks the integrity of all table and index page chains, and
checks that each page is correctly allocated. It checks the integrity of
all extent chains in the database, and verifies that each chain is
correctly linked. NEWALLOC also checks for object ID consistency between
the page, the extent, and sysindexes. In general, NEWALLOC checks things
at
a page and inter-page level.
<P>
CHECKTABLE/CHECKDB by contrast spends most of its time checking things at
an intra-page level. In addition to checking the page chain, it checks
that
indexes are in properly sorted order, that the data information inside
each
page is reasonable, that page offsets are reasonable, that the sysindexes
entries for the table are correct, and that the data row count equals the
leaf row count for non-clustered indexes.
<P>
DBCC NEWALLOC and CHECKDB perform largely complementary checks and should
generally both be run to get a comprehensive check of the database.
<P>
By necessity DBCC is I/O intensive. For NEWALLOC, running time will be
roughly proportional to the database space in use. This is because most of
NEWALLOC's time is spent doing sequential reads. Time for this will scale
linearly with the size of the database. For this same reason NEWALLOC can
be significantly faster on version 6.0 because the parallel read-ahead
facility increases the scanning rate.
<P>
Running time for CHECKDB is more dependant on the number of indexes in the
database and number of rows per table, so the time cannot be predicted by
the database size alone. Version 6.0 uses parallel threads for CHECKTABLE,
one to check each index. When combined with the 6.0 read-ahead facility,
on
computers with sufficient memory, CHECKTABLE/CHECKDB can be significantly
faster on 6.0 than on 4.2. The amount of memory needed to ensure this
would
be approximately the amount where the SQL page cache (visible with dbcc
memusage) is larger than the largest individual table in the database. On
computers with less memory than this, you may want to experiment with
disabling read ahead for the CHECKTABLE/CHECKDB session by using trace
flag
653. You can disable parallel CHECKTABLE by using trace flag 2508. Setting
the sp_configure "RA worker threads" parameter to 0 disables both read
ahead and parallel CHECKTABLE. See the version 6.0 online documentation
for
details on how to use trace flags.
for
<P>
Tests indicate that SQL Server 6.0 can run DBCC NEWALLOC on a 2 GB
database
in less than 30 minutes, when running on a typical industry standard
symmetric multiprocessor (SMP) platform.
<P>
As for concurrency impact of DBCC, NEWALLOC and CHECKDB are both online
checks in that the database can be in use while they run. There is
concurrency impact, but in many cases this is acceptable. NEWALLOC impact
is primarily the I/O and CPU load from the check. In addition to the I/O
and CPU load, CHECKDB places a shared table lock on each table while it's
being checked. While allowing SELECTs, this will prevent modification
of the table until CHECKDB moves on to the next table in the database. The
share lock is necessary to achieve a reliable check.
<P>
It is usually best to run NEWALLOC when update activity in the database is
at a minimum, since there is a possibility of spurious errors caused by in-
progress changes during the check.
<P>
<P><h3>Specific Steps to Minimize DBCC Impact and Increase Performance</h3>
 
<P>
General Advice:

<OL><P><LI>Because DBCC is I/O-intensive, use hardware with plenty of I/O
</OL>capacity.
<PRE>   One good way to increase I/O capacity is by placing the database on a
   large RAID disk array, using as many physical drives as possible.

</PRE><P><LI>Use hardware with plenty of RAM. The ideal case would be sufficient RAM
   such that the largest table can be contained in the SQL Server page
   cache. This is especially important on version 6.0 where it will allow
   full utilization of parallel index checking and read ahead.

<P><LI>Ideally you should run DBCC NEWALLOC, CHECKDB, CHECKCATALOG, and
</OL>TEXTALL
<PRE>   (if you have text/image data) in conjunction with your database dumps.
   This verifies the state of the database at the time of the dump.
   However, if time does not permit all of these checks, the best single
   check to run is NEWALLOC. It is typically faster than CHECKDB, and
   provides a good overall check of the database. It is better to run
   NEWALLOC alone than to run no checks at all.

</PRE><P><LI>If your database has a nightly interval where update activity is low,
   rather than setting the database to single-user mode for NEWALLOC, just
   run it and watch for any errors. On the optimistic principal that most
   of the time the low activity will not cause spurious errors, you would
   only then need to schedule a NEWALLOC in single-user mode when you see
   errors.
<P>
   NOTE: 6.5 Service Pack 2 NEWALLOC has been enhanced to avoid most
   spurious errors when running in multi-user mode. It is likely  that you
   can avoid the need to place the database in single-user mode for
   NEWALLOC simply by running 6.5 Service Pack 2 or later. See the
   6.5 Service Pack 2 readme file for details.

<P><LI>Although it is best to run both NEWALLOC and CHECKDB together, if
   circumstances require it (say the database is extremely large) you
</OL>could
<PRE>   consider running NEWALLOC as the more frequent check, owing to the non-
   blocking nature and quicker running time it provides. Then on a less-
   frequent basis, supplement this with CHECKDB.

</PRE><P><LI>Run CHECKDB with the NOINDEX option. The most time-consuming aspect of
   CHECKDB is checking non-clustered indexes. These checks can be bypassed
   with this syntax. For example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      DBCC CHECKDB(MYDB, NOINDEX)
</PRE>
<P><LI>Run DBCC on a "hot backup" server. Sites with close to 24x7 uptime
   requirements often have a hot backup computer on which transaction logs
   are loaded frequently. Otherwise, a failure on the main server would
   preclude 24x7 availability. If you have a hot backup computer, it's
   possible to run DBCC on that computer without impacting the main
</OL>server.
<PRE>   A DBCC run on the backup computer is just as valid and effective a test
   as when run on the main server. If you do not have a hot backup server,
   the combined benefits of the safety net it provides plus the DBCC
   solution can be strong arguments for getting one.

</PRE></OL>How to Run CHECKTABLE While In Production:
<P>
Sometimes you may need to check a specific table or its indexes. On large
memory computers, there is a technique that can sometimes allow this with
very little concurrency impact, even while the computer is at modest
production activity levels. It basically consists of pre-loading the page
cache with the table and index contents using a non-blocking SELECT with
the NOLOCK optimizer hint, then checking a single index at a time to
minimize the time the table is share locked. In some cases, it's possible
to check a 200 MB table in less than 60 seconds using this technique. The
following are the steps needed to achieve this:

<OL><P><LI>Verify activity level on the computer is modest. This will help ensure
   that pre-loaded cache pages are not stolen by concurrent requests while
   DBCC runs. Here is a good query to help check this. Run it several
</OL>times
<PRE>   and observe what queries are active.

      SELECT SPID, STATUS, HOSTNAME, PROGRAM_NAME, CMD, BLOCKED
      FROM MASTER..SYSPROCESSES
      WHERE STATUS &lt;&gt; 'SLEEPING'

</PRE><P><LI>Verify the table and indexes you want to check will fit into available
   page cache by comparing the table and index size to the page cache
</OL>size.
<PRE>   Table and index size in 2048-byte pages can be seen by issuing this
   query, where TAB1 represents your table name:

      SELECT NAME, INDID, DPAGES
      FROM SYSINDEXES
      WHERE ID=OBJECT_ID("TAB1")

   Execute DBCC MEMUSAGE and inspect the size of the returned "Page Cache"
   value. Only if the sum of your table and index size is less than the
   page cache size is it possible to use this technique. Ideally, page
   cache should be significantly larger to allow servicing of other
   requests during execution of DBCC, without depleting the cache holding
   the table being checked.

</PRE><P><LI>Pre-load the page cache by issuing SELECTs that return no results,
</OL>using
<PRE>   NOLOCK and INDEX optimizer hints to ensure a non-blocking SELECT and
   that each index is covered. This could take several minutes, depending
   on table size and computer I/O bandwidth.

      select * from tab1 (nolock index=0) where key_id &lt; 0
      select * from tab1 (nolock index=1) where key_id &lt; 0
      select * from tab1 (nolock index=2) where key_id &lt; 0

</PRE><P><LI>While the above query runs, use PerfMon to watch I/O vs. CPU activity.
   Watch all instances of the "% Disk Time" counter of the "LogicalDisk"
   object. Also watch the "% Total Processor Time" counter of the "System"
   object. To see valid disk performance information, you must have
   previously turned on the Windows NT DISKPERF setting by issuing
   "diskperf -Y" from a command prompt. See the Windows NT documentation
   for more details.
<P>
   After all the data is pre-loaded, you can usually re-scan the entire
   table with one of the above commands within a few seconds, during which
   CPU should be high and I/O almost 0.  Do this to verify the data is
   still in cache.

<P><LI>Run DBCC CHECKTABLE on a single index of the table at a time. During
   this interval, a share lock will block attempts to update the table,
</OL>but
<PRE>   (depending on the computer speed and table size) CHECKTABLE will finish
   checking a single index within 30 seconds to two minutes. For example:

      DBCC CHECKTABLE(TAB1, 2)

   Then proceed and check the other indexes on the table.

</PRE><P><LI>While CHECKTABLE is running, watch closely for any blocking you may be
   causing. If you miscalculate and CHECKTABLE causes more blocking than
   you anticipate, you can usually abort CHECKTABLE using the Transact-SQL
   KILL command. Here is a good query to watch the amount of blocking:
<P>
<P><PRE>      SELECT SPID, STATUS, HOSTNAME, PROGRAM_NAME, CMD, BLOCKED
      FROM MASTER..SYSPROCESSES
      WHERE BLOCKED &gt; 0
</PRE><P>
</OL>Conclusion:
<P>
Integrity checking programs for file systems or databases tend to have
long
running times when applied to large data sets. Performance of SQL Server
6.0 DBCC has been significantly improved via read ahead and parallel index
checking. When SQL Server 6.0 is run on an adequately equipped platform,
and the techniques mentioned in this article are used, it is usually
possible to minimize the impact of DBCC to a reasonable level. Specific
techniques include running only the necessary DBCC utilities,
understanding
the concurrency impact of each utility and hence when during the day it
can
be run, running DBCC on a "hot backup" server, and pre-loading the page
cache prior to checking a specific table.
