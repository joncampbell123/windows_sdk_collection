The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SQL Server, version 6.5
</UL> 
BUG #: 16713 (Windows NT: 6.5)
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
A declare cursor statement with a select list consisting of a number of
coalesce statements may fail with message 702, "memory request exceeds size
of a page."
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, select into a temporary table and declare the
cursor on the temporary table.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SQL Server
version 6.5. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The scenario tested in this case had 26 coalesce statements involving the
aggregate function sum, as in the following:
<P>
<PRE>   coalesce(sum(x),0)

</PRE>The select list also included two more columns; however, the total length
of all columns did not exceed 1,962 bytes. The where clause had four
conditions anded together, and there was a group by.
<P>
When run outside of the declare cursor, the select statement ran to
completion.
<P>
Testing showed that the type of cursor does not matter, nor does replacing
coalesce with searched case. However, the error did not happen if one of
the following was done:

<UL><LI>One of the columns in the select clause was removed.

<LI>The group by was removed.

<LI>All coalesce statements were removed from all columns.

<LI>One condition in the where clause was sacrificed.
