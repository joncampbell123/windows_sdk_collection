<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
SQL Server marks a database suspect if any of the device files for the
database are unavailable when it attempts to start. You may see either of
the following sets of messages in the SQL Server error log:
<P>
<PRE>   96/11/18 10:48:32.60 kernel   udopen: Operating System Error 32 (The
   process cannot access the file because it is being used by another
   process.) during the creation/opening of physical device,
   C:\DATA\SQL\MSDB.DAT

   96/11/18 10:48:32.60 kernel   udactivate (primary): failed to open
   device C:\MSSQL\DATA\MSDB.DAT for vdn 127

   -or-

   96/11/18 10:48:32.60 kernel   udopen: operating system error 2(The
   system cannot find the file specified.) during the creation/opening
   of physical device C:\MSSQL\DATA\MSDB.DAT

   96/11/18 10:48:32.60 kernel   udactivate (primary): failed to open
   device C:\MSSQL\DATA\MSDB.DAT for vdn 127

</PRE>These will be followed later in the log by:
<P>
<PRE>   96/11/18 10:48:36.70 kernel   udread: Operating system error 6(The
   handle is invalid.) on device 'C:\MSSQL\DATA\MSDB.DAT' (virtpage
   0x7f000018).

   96/11/18 10:48:36.77 spid11   Error : 840, Severity: 17, State: 2

   96/11/18 10:48:36.77 spid11   Device 'MSDBData' (with physical name
   'C:\MSSQL\DATA\MSDB.DAT', and virtual device number 127) is not
   available. Please contact System Administrator for assistance.

   96/11/18 10:48:36.77 spid11   Buffer 1092480 from database 'msdb'
   has page number 0 in the page header and page number 24 in the
   buffer header

   96/11/18 10:48:37.43 spid11   Unable to proceed with the recovery of
   dbid &lt;5&gt; because of previous errors.  Continuing with the next
   database.

</PRE>For example, performing the following steps will demonstrate the problem:

<OL><P><LI>Stop SQL Server.

<P><LI>Issue the following command from a command prompt at the Mssql\Data
   directory:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ren msdb.dat msdb.sav
</PRE>
<P><LI>Start SQL Server.
<P>
</OL>You will see the above errors (the ones from the second set) in the SQL
Server errorlog. If you then issue the following query in the master
database
<P>
<PRE>   select name, dbid, mode, status from sysdatabases where dbid =
   select db_id('msdb')

</PRE></OL>You receive the following results:
<P>
<PRE>   name     dbid   mode   status
   ------------------------------

   msdb      5      0      328

</PRE>The status of 328 evaluates to:
<P>
<PRE>   truncate log on chkpt
   database not recovered yet
   database is suspect

</PRE>For more information, see the "Sysdatabases (Master Database Only)" topic
in the SQL Server Books Online.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
At startup, SQL Server attempts to obtain an exclusive lock on the device
file. If the device is being used by another process (for example, backup
software) or if the file is missing, the scenario described above will be
encountered. In these cases, there is usually nothing wrong with the
devices and database. For the database to recover correctly, the device
must be made available, and the database status must be reset.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, perform the steps below. Note that the
final step is critical.

<OL><P><LI>Ensure that the device file is actually available.

<P><LI>Use the supplemental stored procedure sp_resetstatus to reset the status
   of a suspect database. If you have not already done so, create this
   procedure by executing the Instsupl.sql script, found in the
   Mssql\Install directory. For more information on sp_resetstatus, see the
   "Resetting the Suspect Status" topic in the SQL Server Books Online.

<P><LI>Execute sp_resetstatus in the master database for the suspect database:
<P>
<P><PRE>      use master
      go
<PRE></PRE>      exec sp_resetstatus msdb   -- replace msdb with your database name

   You will see the following output:

      Prior to Update sysdatabases attempt for DBName='msdb', the mode=0
      and status=328 (status suspect_bit=256). For DBName='msdb' in
      sysdatabases, status bit 256 was forced Off and mode was forced to
      0. WARNING: You MUST stop/restart SQL Server prior to accessing this
      database!

</PRE><P><LI>Stop and restart SQL Server.

<P><LI>Verify that the database was recovered and is available.

<P><LI>Run DBCC NEWALLOC, DBCC TEXTALL, and DBCC CHECKDB.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If the database is still marked as suspect after performing these steps,
there may be other problems preventing the database from recovering. At
this point, you can either restore from a good backup or set the database
to emergency mode and use the bulk copy program (BCP) to bulk copy the data
out. For more information, see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

               NO_LOG

</PRE></OL>IMPORTANT: If you use this article (<B><A href="../sqlserver/q165918.htm">Q165918</A></B>) and are unsure of the full
consequences of any of the actions you are performing, contact your primary
support provider for assistance.
