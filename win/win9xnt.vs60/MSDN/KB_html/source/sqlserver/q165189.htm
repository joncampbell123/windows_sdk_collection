The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SQL Server, versions 6.0 and 6.5
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When SQL Server receives many simultaneous Named Pipes connection requests,
some connection requests may fail if the pipe is busy. In the SQL Server
error log, multiple "17832 Unable to read login packet" errors are
typically logged. On the client side, error 231 "connection busy" or "pipe
busy" may be generated.
<P>
These errors may be generated when a client connection tries to open a pipe
and there is no pipe instance available to service the next pipe open
request. This is an expected behavior in an environment where SQL Server is
hit by numerous simultaneous connection requests, as in the case of
Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS).
<P>
However, this behavior does not prevent you from implementing very large
multi-user systems. In fact, Microsoft SQL Server is used in production
with over 4,000 concurrent users connecting by means of named pipes to a
single server.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
There is only one thread that handles incoming SQL Server Named Pipes
connection open requests. In an environment where multiple simultaneous
named pipes connection requests are issued, it is very likely that no pipe
instance is available to service the next pipe open request at any
particular moment. In this case, a pipe busy status is returned to the
client and the client retries the connection within the specified
timeout period until the pipe is available. From a network sniffer trace,
on the Windows NT Server Create response, error code (172)
STATUS_PIPE_NOT_AVAILABLE is returned to the client. In case of a 16-bit
client connection, code (231) ERROR_PIPE_BUSY is returned to the client.
<P>
In this situation, DB-Library and the ODBC driver issue a retry mechanism
that retries after a delay that varies from 200 ms up to one second. The
client may successfully connect during one of the retries, but it may also
fail if the connection keeps receiving a pipe busy status in all the
retries for the duration of the logon timeout value that is set on the
client.
<P>
The "17832 Unable to read login packet" errors are more noticeable if you
have an ODBC front end application. This error is generated because the
initial session between the client and the server has been established but
the client timed out before the login packet was sent to the server.
<P>
The following suggestions can help reduce the occurrences of these errors:

<UL><LI>Increase the application logon timeout value. In this interval,
   DB-Library and the ODBC driver manager will retry connecting to SQL
   Server, thereby increasing the chance of a successful connection.

<LI>Configure SQL Server to listen on multiple pipes. Doing this will
   increase the number of threads available to process incoming Named Pipes
   connections. Different client workstations must be configured to use
   alternate pipes to evenly distribute the load on each pipe.
<P>
   You can configure SQL Server to listen on multiple pipes by using the
   registry editor.
<P>
   WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-
   wide problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct
   them. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the
   use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.
<P>
   1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe) and locate the following subkey
<P><PRE>      in the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>         Software\Microsoft\MSSQLServer\MSSQLServer

   2. Double-click the ListenOn value.

   3. On a new line in the Multi-string editor window, add the following:

         SSNMPN60,\\.\pipe\sql1\query
         SSNMPN60,\\.\pipe\sql2\query

   4. Click OK and quit Registry Editor.

   5. Shut down and restart SQL Server.

   You can configure the client to connect to SQL server using an alternate
   pipe through the SQL Client Configuration Utility.

   1. From the client workstation, start SQL Client Configuration Utility.

   2. Click the Advanced tab or click the Advanced button.

   3. Add the following values in the Advanced window:

         Server:            &lt;server name&gt;
         DLL name:          DBNMPNTW
         connection string: \\&lt;server name&gt;\pipe\sql1\query

   In case of 16-bit tools, the DLL name should be DBNMP3.

   4. Click the Add\Modify button and then click Done to exit from the SQL
      Server Client Configuration Utility.

</PRE><LI>Modify the application to trap the connection busy or pipe busy errors
   and force the application to retry connecting to the server.

<LI>Reconfigure the clients to use the sockets Net-Library, which avoids
   busy signals (due to the TCP/IP backlog queue feature).
<P>
</UL>For more information about configuring TCP/IP backlog parameter to handle
multiple and simultaneous connections to SQL Server, please refer to the
