The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SQL Server versions 6.5 Service Packs 1, 2, and 3
</UL> 
BUG #: 16803 (6.5)
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you run a query on a view defined with a subquery in its select list,
you may experience impaired performance. However, a direct query for the
equivalent select with no view (with or without a predicate against the
view) yields much faster performance.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To improve performance, do either of the following:

<UL><LI>Execute the query on the underlying tables rather than on the view.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Create the view so that it does not contain a subquery for the select
   list.
<P>
</UL>NOTE: Views created under versions of SQL Server earlier than 6.5 Service
Pack 1 with a subquery in the select list will continue to work, even under
SQL Server 6.5 Service Pack 1 and later, provided that they are not
re-created under these later versions of SQL Server.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SQL Server version 6.5
Service Packs 1, 2, and 3.
This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SQL Server 6.5 U.S.
Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on
the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To use the fix for this bug, you must enable trace flag 349 (which was
newly added). To ensure that the proper queries take advantage of this fix,
you may consider starting the server with the trace flag enabled, so that
all connections have the trace flag enabled. The SQL Server Setup program
(in Server Options) provides a means to add startup parameters. Add the
parameter -T349 to the list. You can enable the trace flag for a specific
connection by executing DBCC TRACEON(349). Doing this is required to
re-create the views(s) in question to invoke the new behavior.
