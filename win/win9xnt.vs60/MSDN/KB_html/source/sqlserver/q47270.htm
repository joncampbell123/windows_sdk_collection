The information in this article applies to:
<P>
<PRE>  - Microsoft SQL Server version 4.2 for OS/2
</PRE> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The following information discusses the topic of access permissions
and trigger execution.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If an operation on an object causes an implicit operation on another
object, and both objects have the same owner, it is assumed that all
privileges granted for the explicit operation also apply to the
implicit operation. If the objects have different owners, it is
assumed that the different owners may have different ideas about who
should be granted access to what.
<P>
If user U1 owns table T1, and that table has a trigger that accesses
table T2 owned by user U2, then a third user U3 must have explicit
permission to access tables T1 and T2. If user U1 had also owned T2,
then user U3 would require only explicit permission to use T1.
<P>
Triggers should not provide a way for someone other than the owner of
an object to determine who has access.
<P>
In a production environment, all objects should be owned by the DBA
and this is not a problem. In a free-for-all environment, with many
users creating objects and triggers, this is the only way to provide
security.
