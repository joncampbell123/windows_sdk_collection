The information in this article applies to:
<P>
<PRE>  - Microsoft Embedded SQL version 4.2 for COBOL
</PRE> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When running an Embedded SQL for COBOL MS-DOS application that either links
with COBLIB or is compiled into a .GNT file, the program reports the
following error:
<P>
<PRE>   R6009 - out of environment space

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The COBOL run-time system, either COBLIB or the Micro Focus resident run-
time system, needs to know at startup how much memory should be freed back
to the application for use by non-COBOL code. Since the library that
handles the SQL Server connections was written in C, it is not allowed any
memory for dynamic allocation at run time. When this library attempts to
allocate memory for connection and query management, it fails and returns
the error listed above.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
The environment variable COBPOOL will tell the run-time system how much
memory to leave the program for non-COBOL functions. This variable is
documented in the "Microsoft COBOL Operating Guide" and indicates how many
kilobytes of memory should be freed. This number will depend on the number
of connections in the program as well as query size. The following command
will work for a very small program such as SQLDOS, which shipped with the
Embedded SQL for COBOL package:
<P>
<PRE>   SET COBPOOL=10

</PRE>This allows 10K to be used for non-COBOL functions, such as the Embedded
SQL for COBOL functions that need to dynamically allocate memory.
