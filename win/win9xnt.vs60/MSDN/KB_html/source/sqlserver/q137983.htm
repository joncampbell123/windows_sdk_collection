The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SQL Server, versions 4.21 and 6.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When a SQL Server client disconnects from a SQL Server, the connection
process should be cleared-up on the server side. If the connection
processes are not cleared-up for whatever reasons, they become "orphaned"
or "ghost" processes, which may use up valuable resources such as locks and
user connections. The orphaned processes are typically caused by improper
closing of client applications and network related problems, and the
remedies usually require troubleshooting client applications and fine-
tuning network configurations.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you troubleshoot this problem, keep the following in mind:
<P>
* SQL Server as an application does not and should not proactively probe
the client connection to determine its current status. The lower level IPCs
(Inter-Process Communications) such as named pipes, IPX/SPX or TCP/IP
sockets, are responsible for managing the client connections.
<P>
* An IPC typically has its own mechanism to manage the client connections.
When client connections become non-responsive for a certain amount of time,
typically the Windows NT Server will either detect this by sending the
"keep alive" probes, or clear-up the connection after it idles for a
configured amount of time.
<P>
* Under certain situations such as client GP-fault or hang, the client may
still respond to server probes even if the application is already dead. In
this case, the Windows NT server may keep this client connection
indefinitely, as long as the client is not shut down.
<P>
* If a Windows NT Server does not terminate a dead connection for whatever
reasons, SQL Server will rightfully assume this connection is still active
and therefore will not clear it up.
<P>
* If the Windows NT Server has successfully terminated the connection, but
the client process still exists on the SQL Server as indicated by sp_who,
then it may indicate a problem with SQL Server's connection management, and
we recommend that you work with your primary support provider to resolve
this issue.
<P>
If you suspect orphaned processes exist on your SQL Server, the following
are steps you can take to troubleshoot the problem:

<OL><P><LI>Identify the orphaned processes using sp_who, which may tell you which
   applications were associated with these processes through the host
   names.

<P><LI>After you identify these orphaned processes, you may choose to either
   ignore them if they are not holding any locks or using many connections,
   or kill them using the SQL Server KILL command.

<P><LI>Check with the application users for any improper procedures of closing
   applications, such as warm or cold reboot of workstations without
   exiting the applications first. Check whether there is any history of
   the workstation becoming unstable, such as a hang, GP-fault, and so
   forth. Correct those improper procedures or stability problems if they
   do exist.

<P><LI>Check whether the IPC session is still active on the Windows NT Server
   where SQL Server is running. Depending on the IPCs you are using, the
   commands are different. For example, if you are using named pipes, the
   command is "NET SESSION" or "NET FILES"; if it is a TCP/IP sockets
   connection, you can use "NETSTAT" to display active TCP sessions; in
   case of IPX/SPX, you may have to use the Performance Monitor to monitor
   the "Connections Open" for "NWLink SPX."

<P><LI>If the IPC sessions are still active on the Windows NT Server, it is
   perfectly normal for SQL Server to keep those connection processes.
   When Windows NT clears-up the IPC sessions, SQL Server will be notified
   and clear-up the connection processes accordingly. You may be able to
   adjust certain Windows NT network parameters to shorten the time period
   that Windows NT has to wait before clearing-up the dead sessions.
<P>
   Again, depending on the IPCs you are using, the parameters involved are
   very different:
<P>
<P><PRE>      * Named Pipes: Windows NT Server depends on the clients to initiate
<PRE></PRE>        the "keep alive" traffic. If the client stops sending the "keep
        alive" packets for whatever reasons, Windows NT Server will clear-
        up the client session after waiting for a configured amount of idle
        time. The default idle time is fifteen minutes for Windows NT 3.51,
        and it is configured through parameter "autodisconnect" in
        HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer
        \Parameters of the Windows NT registry.

      * TCP/IP Sockets: Windows NT Server will periodically send "keep
        alive" packets to clients, and clients are expected to respond. If
        for whatever reasons the client fails to respond to those packets,
        Windows NT will clear up the TCP session after trying for a
        configured number of times. The parameters involved are:
        KeepAliveInterval, KeepAliveTime, and TcpMaxDataRetransmissions in
        HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip
        \Parameters of the Windows NT registry.

      * IPX/SPX: Similar to TCP/IP, Windows NT server periodically sends
       "keep alive" packets and clients respond. Windows NT will clear-up
        the SPX connections if failing to receive any responses after
        sending configured number of "keep alive" packets. The parameters
        involved are KeepAliveCount and KeepAliveTimeout in
        HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\NWLnkSPX
        \Parametes of the Windows NT registry.

   Please note that if the "keep alive" parameters for your IPCs are
   configured to never timeout, Windows NT will keep the IPC sessions
   indefinitely, even if the clients are completely shut down. In this
   case, SQL Server will keep these client processes indefinitely as
   well, which is expected.

   For further information about the parameters, please consult your
   Windows NT documentation or Windows NT Resource Kit. If you suspect your
   Windows NT Server does not clear-up those sessions according to the
   configuration parameters, you can contact your primary Windows NT
   support provider for help.

</PRE><P><LI>If the IPC session no longer exists on the Windows NT Server, but SQL
   Server still keeps client process as shown by sp_who, you can use the
   KILL command to clear-up the process as a temporary solution, and
   contact your primary SQL Server support provider for further assistance.
