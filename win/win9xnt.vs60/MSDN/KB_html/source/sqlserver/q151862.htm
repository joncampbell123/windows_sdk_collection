The information in this article applies to:

</UL> 
<P>
SUMMARY
 
<P>
The following article contains information on the files necessary to
distribute a SQL-DMO developed application.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The client will need a valid SQL Server connection license.
<P>
There are differences between the SQL-DMO versions 6.0 and 6.5. A client
cannot have both versions installed. The DLLs from 6.0 and 6.5 use the
same registry keys, making it impossible to have a multiple-version SQL-DMO
client.
<P>
You will need the following SQL-DMO components (the requirements for each
version are listed separately):
<P>
For SQL-DMO 6.0 you will need:

<UL><LI>Client files:
<P>
   ..\SQL60\DLL\SQLOLE32.DLL  : This is the DLL to support the
   SQL-DMO objects
<P>
   ..\SQL60\DLL\SQLOLE.REG : The registry components.

<LI>Server files:
<P>
   ..\SQL60\INSTALL\SQLOLE60.SQL: The stored procedures called by SQL-DMO

<LI>Installation:
<P>
   The SQLOLE.REG file is installed using the Regedit.exe utility. This is
   not the same Regedit shipped with Windows 95, but rather the 16 bit
   version. As such it will require an 8.3 naming convention, or the
   processing will result in an error with an invalid file name.
<P>
   Use ISQL or similar utility to install the SQLOLE60.SQL. This should
   only need to be done once at the SQL Server itself.
<P>
<P>
</UL>For SQL-DMO 6.5 you will need:

<UL><LI>Client files:
<P>
   ..\MSSQL\BINN\SQLOLE65.DLL : The DLL to support the SQL-DMO objects.

<LI>Server Files:
<P>
<PRE>   ..\MSSQL\INSTALL\SQLOLE65.SQL    -  Stored procedures called by SQL-DMO

</PRE><LI>Installation:
<P>
   To install the registry entries, run the following command:
<P>
<P><PRE>      REGSVR32.EXE SQLOLE65.DLL
</PRE><P>
   This is the 6.5 equivalent to the REGEDIT used in the 6.0 installation
   procedure.
<P>
   Use ISQL or a similar utility to install the SQLOLE65.SQL. This should
   only need to be done once at the SQL Server itself. This is compatible
   with the SQL-DMO 6.0 procedures, so if you run this on a server you can
   still connect to the server with 6.0 SQL-DMO clients.
<P>
</UL>For both versions:
<P>
You will need the appropriate DB-Library component (NTWDBLIB.DLL) and
Network Library (by default this would be DBNMPNTW.DLL).
<P>
You must also have the SQLSVC32.DLL file available and in the applications
search path.
<P>
When developing your application, be sure you develop on the appropriate
client. You need to make sure you are using the appropriate SQL-DMO (.tlb)
file and header files; otherwise, the application may not perform as
expected when you move it. For example, if Visual Basic (VB) cannot locate
a constant it uses zero (0). This will not be the correct value in most
cases.
