The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SQL Server, version 6.5
</UL> 
BUG #: 16569 (6.5)
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When processing a large join, the parse and compile time as indicated by
SET STATISTICS TIME ON can be much greater for SQL Server 6.5 than it was
for SQL Server 6.0. In one scenario a 9-way join took approximately 9.4
seconds to parse and compile on SQL Server 6.5, but only 1.3 seconds on
version 6.0. Once parsed and compiled, the actual query execution time was
similar between SQL Server versions 6.5 and 6.0. The problem happens
whether the query is ad-hoc or is in a stored procedure.
<P>
This problem should not directly cause additional blocking or deadlocking,
because no additional time is spent in the execution phase, and lock
duration should be unchanged. However, this problem may use additional CPU
resources.
<P>
All versions of SQL Server 6.5 through SQL Server 6.5 Service Pack 2
exhibit this behavior.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Use trace flag 342, which disables the costing of pseudo merge joins. This
significantly reduces the amount of time spent in the parse and compile
phase, and in the queries thus far examined has no negative execution
performance impact. For instructions on how to use trace flags, see the SQL
Server 6.5 documentation.
<P>
Alternatively you can use SET FORCEPLAN ON, which forces the join order
indicated in the query FROM clause.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SQL Server
version 6.5. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
