The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SQL Server versions 4.21a, 6.0, and 6.5
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article explains code pages in SQL Server, and how inserting or
retrieving data is affected by enabling or disabling the AutoAnsiToOem
setting.
<P>
A code page, also known as a character set, is a set of 256 uppercase and
lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. The printable characters of the
first 128 values are the same for all character set choices. The last 128
characters, sometimes referred to as extended characters, differ from set
to set. The default code page for SQL Server 4.21a is code page 850
(Multilingual). The default for SQL Server 6.0 and 6.5 is ISO 8859-1 (Latin
1 or ANSI), also known as code page 1252. The code page for SQL Server
determines both the types of characters that SQL Server recognizes in your
database, and the results that SQL Server returns for queries that involve
character comparisons.
<P>
Note that the code page of SQL Server is different from the code page of
the operating system. Windows NT and Windows 95 operating systems have an
ANSI code page and an OEM code page. The ANSI and OEM code pages depend on
the country settings. For the U.S. English Windows NT and Windows 95, the
default ANSI code page is 1252, and the OEM code page is 437 (U.S.
English). MS-DOS only has an OEM code page. For U.S. English, this code
page is 437 by default. Windows 3.x runs as an extension to MS-DOS, and has
an ANSI code page 1252 by default. Windows NT Console is internally
unicode; however, this is a special case and it must appear to be running
in an MS-DOS code page. Thus, console applications under Windows NT
effectively run the OEM code page of the computer. However, any command line
parameters passed to the console application are in the ANSI code page
instead of the OEM code page and thus, a translation of AnsiToOem is required
by the console application to properly pass the parameters to SQL Server.
<P>
The registry entry AutoAnsiToOem controls the default conversion behavior
when data is inserted or retrieved. If AutoAnsiToOem is enabled, conversion
is enabled in the following cases:

<UL><LI>ANSI clients to OEM servers

<LI>OEM clients to ANSI servers
<P>
</UL>If AutoAnsiToOem is disabled, conversion is disabled for all connections.
<P>
All of the Windows-based clients (such as Isql/w, SQL Enterprise Manager,
Transfer Manager, SQL Administrator, and SQL Object Manager) are considered
ANSI clients. MS-DOS or console-based applications such as Isql and BCP are
considered OEM clients. The exception to this is the Transfer Data option
of Object Manager, which behaves as an OEM client.
<P>
A SQL Server with code page 1252 (ISO 8859-1) is considered to be an ANSI
server, and a SQL Server with any other code page (for example, 850 or 437)
is considered to be an OEM server.
<P>
The OEM code page used to translate characters depends on the current OEM
code page of the client's operating system. For example, with the
AutoAnsiToOem option enabled, ASCII character 165 (¥) in an ANSI server
gets converted to ASCII 190 (¥) when selecting from an OEM client with code
page 850, and to ASCII 157 (¥) when selecting from an OEM client with code
page 437.

<P>
PART A: How to Determine the Code Page of SQL Server
<P>
The stored procedure sp_helpsort can be used to find the SQL Server's sort
order and character set.
<P>
PART B: Enabling or Disabling AutoAnsiToOem
<P>
The registry entry AutoAnsiToOem can be enabled or disabled by selecting
the Automatic ANSI to OEM check box in the client configuration utility. In
SQL Server 4.21a, Automatic ANSI to OEM is disabled by default, whereas in
versions 6.0 and 6.5 it is enabled by default.
<P>
PART C: How to Check the Validity of the Data Saved
<P>
The Transact SQL string function ASCII(char_expr) can be used to determine
what is actually saved on the server. This function shows the ASCII code
value of the leftmost character in a character expression. For example, if
you have character "±" saved on an 850 server, selecting the data from
Isql/w may show you character "±" (when AutoAnsiToOem is on) or "ñ" (when
AutoAnsiToOem is off). However, selecting ASCII(&lt;column_name&gt;) will show
you 241 (which is "±" on 850 code page).
<P>
PART D: What Happens when a Character on One Code Page is Unavailable on
Another
<P>
If a conversion occurs and a character on one code page is unavailable on
another, the character gets converted to its closest equivalent character
on the other code page. For example, ASCII 224 ("alpha") on code page 437
is converted to 97("a") on the ANSI code page. When you convert it back to
code page 437, you receive 97("a"). This is a problem, because you have now
lost the original 224("alpha"). This can potentially cause incorrect data
to be saved on your server, as happens in the following two examples:
<P>
Example 1:
<P>
<PRE>   You have an OEM server in which you are inserting data from an ANSI
   client, and your AutoAnsiToOem option is enabled. If the character that
   you are inserting is valid in both code pages, the correct data will be
   saved. However, if the character is valid in ANSI but not in OEM,
   the correct data will not be saved.

</PRE>Example 2:
<P>
<PRE>   You insert data into an ANSI server from an OEM client, and the
   AutoAnsiToOem option is enabled. If the character that you are inserting
   is valid in both code pages, the correct data will be saved. However, if
   the character is valid in OEM and not in ANSI, then correct data will
   not be saved.

</PRE>PART E: Entering Extended Characters with a U.S. Keyboard
<P>
Press NUMLOCK and use the numeric keypad on the right side of the keyboard.
To enter ANSI extended characters, hold the ALT key and then type the ASCII
code of the character preceded by a zero (0). To enter OEM extended
characters, hold the ALT key and type just the ASCII code of the character.
For example, to enter ¥, hold ALT and type 0165, or type 157 (if the
client's OEM code page is 437), or type 190 (if the client's OEM code page
is 850).
<P>
PART F: How to Change the OEM Code Page of Windows NT and Windows 95
<P>
For Windows NT 3.51, the preferred method of changing the OEM code page in
Windows NT is to change the language in Control Panel International. For
Windows NT 4.0 or Windows 95, the OEM code page is chosen during initial
setup.
<P>
Additionally, The OEM code page can be changed by changing the OEMCP and
OEMHAL (Windows NT only) registry values in the following location:
<P>
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentlControlSet\Control\Nls\CodePage
<P>
These changes take effect after rebooting Windows NT or Windows 95.
<P>
The OEMCP value controls to which OEM code page to translate ANSI, and the
OEMHAL value controls the display of extended characters at a command
prompt. Some of the possible values for these registry values are:
<P>
<P><h3>OEM Code page  OEMCP value  OEMHAL value</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>437            437          vgaoem.fon
850            850          vga850.fon

</PRE>In addition to changing the OEMCP registry value, this setting also changes
the OEMHAL value, which controls the display of extended characters at a
command prompt.
<P>
PART G: How to Change OEM Code Page of MS-DOS and Windows 3.x
<P>
To change the code page for MS-DOS, refer to Chapter 6, National Language
Support in the MS-DOS Programming Reference 6.0. Once the MS-DOS code page
is changed, you must run the Windows Setup program to change its ANSI-OEM
translation tables for ANSI to OEM conversion.
<P>
PART H: Client Suggestions for Consistent Data
<P>
The following suggestions will help to ensure that the data stored on the
SQL Server is stored according to the SQL Server code page rather than the
client's code page, which is usually the cause of bad data.
<P>
MS-DOS clients: Since MS-DOS only has an OEM code page and no ANSI code
page, no conversions are made. The client will always store data on the
server with the client's OEM code page, so the code page of SQL Server
should be set to match the client's code page.
<P>
OEM and ANSI clients: If the computer running SQL Server is not using the
ANSI code page, change the client's OEM code page to match the SQL Server
code page and enable the AutoAnsiToOem conversion. If the computer running
SQL Server is using the ANSI code page, just enable the AutoAnsiToOem
conversion.
<P>
The following are exceptions to the above suggestions:

<UL><LI>For the Win32 Bcp.exe client importing to an ANSI SQL Server, change the
   client's code page to match the code page that the data was created
   with.

<LI>For the Win32 Bcp.exe client exporting from an ANSI SQL Server, change
   the client's code page to the code page of the SQL Server that the
   export results will be imported into. For example, to import into a SQL
   Server with code page 850, change the client's code page to 850.

<LI>For the SQL Server Transfer Manager 4.2x and 6.0 client, change the
   client's code page to match the code page of the non-ANSI code page SQL
   Server, if both SQL servers are not using the ANSI code page. The
   following table summarizes this:
<P>
<PRE>   Source SQL Server  Destination SQL   Client code
   code page          Server code page  page to use
   ------------------------------------------------

   ANSI               437               437
   850                ANSI              850
   850                850               850
   437                850               *

   * When transferring between OEM code pages, make two transfers instead:
     OEM1 to ANSI followed by ANSI to OEM2.

</PRE></UL>PART I: MS-DOS Isql.exe Examples
<P>
The tables in each of the following examples show the decimal equivalents
of the character at various points.
<P>
INSERT and SELECT of the ¥ character with the MS-DOS Isql.exe client with a
437 OEM code page into and from a 437 code page SQL Server.
<P>
<P><h3>Operation  On client  Client conversion  On server</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>INSERT     157        157*               157
SELECT     157        157*               157

   * The value never changes from 157, since MS-DOS clients do not perform
     AnsiToOem conversions.

</PRE>PART J: Win32 Bcp.exe Examples
<P>
Example 1:
<P>
EXPORT and IMPORT of the ¥ character Win32 Bcp.exe client with an
850 OEM code page into an 850 code page SQL Server.

   * Because both the client and server are OEM, no conversion is
     performed.

</PRE>Example 2:
<P>

<P>
<PRE>EXPORT     165        165*               165

   * Because the ANSI code page matches the OEM code page on the client, no
     conversion occurs.

   ** ¥ converted to OEM equivalent.

</PRE>PART M: ODBC and ANSI to OEM Conversions
<P>
All ODBC clients (GUI and console applications) are ANSI clients as defined
by the ODBC specification. Translation will only occur with non-ANSI code
page SQL Servers. ODBC clients have three translation choices: no
translation, translate with OEM code page, or use an ODBC Code Page
Translator. Translation with the OEM code page works the same as DB-Library
ANSI to OEM conversion, in that the OEM code page of the client determines
what is stored on the server. This option is chosen by selecting the Convert
OEM to ANSI characters check box in the Datasource Setup dialog box. To use
an ODBC Code Page Translator, click the Select button in the Translation
section of the Datasource Setup dialog box, click the MS Code Page
translator, and then select the code page translator to use. This option
overrides the Convert OEM to ANSI characters check box and does the OEM
translation according to the translator chosen, instead of the OEM code
page. All ODBC clients are ANSI clients, and translation will only occur
with non-ANSI code page SQLservers.
<P>
PART N: MS-Query ODBC Client Examples
<P>
Example 1:
<P>
SELECT of MS-Query client from an ANSI code page SQL Server.
<P>
<P><h3>On server  Client conversion  On client</h3>
 
<PRE>165        165*               165

   * Since both client and server are ANSI, no conversion is performed no
   matter which translation is chosen.

</PRE>Example 2:
<P>
SELECT of MS-Query client with OEM code page 437, and Convert OEM to ANSI
character enabled, from a 437 code page SQL Server.
<P>
<P><h3>On server  Client conversion  On client</h3>
 
<PRE>157        165*               165

   * Converted to ANSI equivalent.

</PRE>Example 3:
<P>
SELECT of MS-Query client with OEM code page 437, Convert OEM to ANSI
character enabled, and the Windows Latin 1(1252)/850 (Multilingual-
Latin 1) MS Code Page translator from a 850 code page SQL Server.
<P>
<P><h3>On server  Client conversion  On client</h3>
 
<PRE>190        165*               165

   * Converted to ANSI equivalent using 850 OEM code page due to
     translator.
