</PRE> 
<P>
The amount of time for SQL Server to process update, insert, and
delete transactions on a given table cannot be calculated with
precision because it is dependent on a variety of factors such as
(but not limited to) the following:

<OL><P><LI>The number of update and delete transactions that are executed.

<P><LI>Whether or not triggers or stored procedures are invoked when an
   update or delete transaction takes place. If either triggers or
   stored procedures are invoked, the type of processing performed by
   these triggers or stored procedures also has an impact on the total
   processing time.

<P><LI>The size of the table these transactions are executed on.

<P><LI>The type of data manipulated. When variable length text data types
   are updated, a delete transaction is performed, followed by an
   insert transaction. Thus, two transactions are executed for every
   one update transaction.

<P><LI>The number and type of indexes (clustered, nonclustered, and so
   forth) on the table.

<P><LI>Whether or not the guidelines for performance tuning as described
   in the "Microsoft SQL Server Installation Manual" and the
   "Microsoft SQL Server System Administrator's Guide" have been
   followed.

<P><LI>Whether or not the update and delete transactions are executed on
   a dedicated server. In other words, other applications may be
   running on the server when the SQL batch job is running; this
   causes competition between the other applications and the SQL
   batch job for CPU time.
