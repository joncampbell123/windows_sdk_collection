The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SQL Server, version 4.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article provides the basic information necessary to execute a query
asynchronously in a SQL Server front-end using the Microsoft Visual Basic
Library for SQL Server (VBSQL).
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Queries sent from a Visual Basic front-end to SQL Server can be sent either
synchronously or asynchronously. Synchronous query execution is done by
calling SqlExec% to execute the query. The client program will pause
execution on the SqlExec% line until the query has been completely
processed by the server, and the results returned to the client program.
<P>
Because Microsoft Windows is a cooperative multitasking environment, it
may be desirable to allow the user to perform other tasks while a long-
running query is executing at the SQL Server. This can be accomplished by
using asynchronous query execution.
<P>
Asynchronous query execution involves using SQLSend% to send the query to
SQL Server, looping until SQLDataReady% returns SUCCEED (1), and then
calling SqlOk% to verify the correctness of the command batch. Inside of
the SqlDataReady% loop, it is necessary to call the Visual Basic function
DoEvents() so that other Windows events can be processed.
<P>
Below is an example code fragment that illustrates the function calls:
<P>
<PRE>   Result% = SqlCmd%(SQLConn%, Query$)
   Result% = SqlSend%(SQLConn%)
   While SQLDataReady%(SQLConn%) = 0
       dummy% = DoEvents()
   Wend
   Result% = SqlOk%(SQLConn%)

</PRE>The SqlDataReady% function will return SUCCEED as soon as there is data
available for processing. Under certain circumstances, some data may be
available for processing at the client, but SqlOk% will still take some
time to return. This is because SqlOk% verifies correctness of the entire
command batch and can only return SUCCEED when an entire result set is
available for processing with SqlResults%.
<P>
Therefore, it is possible to get into a situation where the SQL Server
begins to send data packets back to the client which causes SqlDataReady%
to correctly return SUCCEED but more processing must be done at the server,
and more data must be sent back to the client before SqlOk% can complete
its work and return SUCCEED.
<P>
If the above situation occurs, any queries or stored procedures involved
would need to be restructured and sent in pieces to avoid a long delay on
the call to SqlOk%.
<P>
NOTE: The same technique for asynchronous query execution could be used in
a Windows application using DB-Library (DB-Lib) for C. The VBSQL function
calls would need to be changed to their DB-Library for C equivalents. Also,
the call to DoEvents() would need to be replaced with appropriate Windows
message-handling code.
<P>
For more information on DB-Library programming techniques, see the article
"Developing Microsoft Windows-Based Applications for Microsoft SQL Server"
in the SQL Server Resource Kit, which is available on the Microsoft Technet
CD.
