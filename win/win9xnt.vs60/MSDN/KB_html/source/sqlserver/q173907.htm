The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SQL Server, version 6.5
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
By default, the date format for SQL server is in U.S. date format MM/DD/YY,
unless a localized version of SQL Server has been installed. This setting
is fine for cases when an application that requires this functionality is
deployed in a manner guaranteeing that dates are used and inserted in the
same format across all platforms and locations where the application is
used.
<P>
However, in some cases the date must be in a DD/MM/YY format because many
countries use this format rather than the U.S. default of MM/DD/YY. This is
especially an issue for international applications that are distributed all
over the world.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If the date format is not taken into consideration by application
developers, a rare situation may arise where an application is inserting
dates into tables or using dates in WHERE clauses that are invalid. For
example, a given date like 20/05/97 will only be processed if the date
format is DD/MM/YY. However, a date like 12/05/97 will be processed with
both the DD/MM/YY and MM/DD/YY formats, possibly resulting in the wrong
date being used.
<P>
A possible solution to this is to use the ISO Standard format for sending
the datetime data to SQL Server, which is "YYYYMMDD" (no separators). Using
the ISO format is more "international," and is independent of the default
language. For more information, see the CONVERT function in the SQL Server
Books Online.
<P>
Another solution is for the client application to check the date format
being used on the SQL Server, to make sure that the dates passed while
executing are in a valid format.
<P>
SQL Server provides the ability to set the date format and other language
settings by adding another language. Just setting the regional setting in
the Windows NT Control Panel to the local region's date format will not
help in using dates in the DD/MM/YY format for SQL Server.
<P>
To use the DD/MM/YY format, use either of the following methods:
<P>
<P><h3>Use the SET Statement Per Connection</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   SET DATEFIRST &lt;number&gt;

</PRE>Sets the first weekday to a number from 1 through 7. The U.S. English
default is 7 (Sunday).
<P>
<PRE>   SET DATEFORMAT &lt;format&gt;

</PRE>Sets the order of the date parts (month/day/year) for entering datetime or
smalldatetime data. Valid parameters include mdy, dmy, ymd, ydm, myd, and
dym. The U.S. English default is mdy.
<P>
This method allows you use a date format for dates sent to SQL Server of
d/m/y, but it is connection dependent. If a new connection is made to SQL
Server or if the server is stopped and restarted, the date format goes back
to m/d/y.
<P>
<P><h3>Set the Language on the SQL Server</h3>
 
<P>
To set the language on the server you must add a language by using
sp_addlanguage. The example below sets the language for British English and
gives the dates in DD/MM/YY format. The example can also be applied to
other countries, but you may need to modify the parameters for
sp_addlanguage.
<P>
<PRE>   exec sp_addlanguage 'British', 'English',
   'January,February,March,April,May,June,July,August,September,October,
   November,December',
      'Jan,Feb,Mar,Apr,May,Jun,Jul,Aug,Sep,Oct,Nov,Dec',
   'Monday,Tuesday,Wednesday,Thursday,Friday,Saturday,Sunday',
   dmy,1

   sp_configure 'default language', 1
   reconfigure with override

</PRE>To set the default language back to U.S. English after having installed
another language, use the following SQL statements:
<P>
<PRE>   sp_configure 'default language', 0
   reconfigure with override

</PRE>To check what default language a server has installed, use the following
SQL command:
<P>
<PRE>   sp_configure 'default language'

</PRE>If the resulting value is 0, the default language U.S. English. If the
result is not 0, run the following SQL command to find the installed
default language setting and date format used:
<P>
<PRE>   select name ,alias, dateformat
   from syslanguages
      where langid =
      (select value from master..sysconfigures
         where comment = 'default language')

</PRE>SQL Server also supports multiple languages, by setting the language in SQL
Server Setup. This requires the use of localization files that are
available for most languages. For more information, please read the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
