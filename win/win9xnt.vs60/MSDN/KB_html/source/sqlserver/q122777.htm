The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SQL Server version 4.2bK12 for OS/2
</UL> 
BUG# OS/2: 1891 (4.2bK12)
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The query tree for some system stored procedures (for example, sp_help)
use temporary tables that may grow after initial execution upon server
restart.
<P>
Eventually the query tree may grow large enough that execution of the
system procedure will result in Msg 703:
<P>
<PRE>   Memory request failed because more than %d pages are required to
   run the query in its present form. The query should be broken up
   into shorter queries if possible.

</PRE>This behavior is specific to system stored procedures that use temporary
tables for processing: sp_help, sp_helpdevice, and sp_helpdb. Since the
query tree grows after the initial execution of the procedure after the
server restart, eventually Msg 703 will be encountered.
<P>
Since the query trees for many systems procedures are initially small in
size, this problem may not be encountered.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
As described in the SQL "Troubleshooting Guide" on page 30, if Msg 703 is
encountered upon execution of a stored procedure, the stored procedure must
be dropped and recreated or broken into smaller objects.
<P>
Since this problem occurs for system stored procedures created in the
INSTMSTR.SQL script (found in the \INSTALL directory), it is recommended to
rerun this script to drop or create the stored procedures that are in
error.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SQL Server version 4.2bk12.
We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
