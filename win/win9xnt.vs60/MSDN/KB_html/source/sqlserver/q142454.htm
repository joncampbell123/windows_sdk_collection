The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SQL Server, version 6.0
</UL> 
BUG# NT: 11464 (6.00)
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Tasks scheduled to execute once a week execute out of schedule. The Task
Scheduler incorrectly schedules the task at the next occurence of the time
specified and subsequently follows the specified schedule.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SQL Server
Version 6.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The task gets scheduled at the time specified the same day or the next day,
depending on when the task was created. The task scheduler incorrectly
schedules the task for the next occurence of the scheduled time. Subsequent
executions follow the specified schedule. Suppose a task was created to be
executed at 5:00 P.M. on every Sunday, and suppose the task was created at
4:00 P.M. on a Tuesday. The first expected schedule time for the task is
the following Sunday, but instead, this task is scheduled for execution for
the first time at 5:00 P.M. on the same day (the first occurence of 5:00
P.M. after it was created) and subsequently follows the schedule, 5:00 P.M.
on Sundays. This problem also happens when existing tasks are edited.
