<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you work with technologies like COM, ISAPI, Transaction Server, and
other extensible architectures, you should strongly consider using ODBC 3.0
instead of DB-Library. Extensible architectures allow the developer to
extend, enhance, and customize the environment. The design of DB-Library
does not always lend itself well to these technologies. This article
discusses some specific extensibility pitfalls of DB-Library and how ODBC
or OLEDB addresses them differently.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
There are currently two native ways to connect and work with Microsoft SQL
Server: DB-Library and the SQL Server ODBC Driver. The SQL Server ODBC
driver does not convert function calls into DB-Library statements. The SQL
Server ODBC driver performs just as fast as, or faster than, DB-Library in
head-to-head tests.
<P>
The goal of COM, Microsoft Transaction Server (MTS), ISAPI, and Extended
Stored Procedure (XPROC) is to allow extensibility. DB-Library maintains
some information on a per-process basis rather than a per-connection basis
which makes this difficult.
<P>
The dbinit() and dbexit() calls should be made when you start and exit the
application. If you are building COM components or an ISAPI extension, it
becomes difficult if you do not control the entire environment.
<P>
Internally, DB-Library maintains an array of valid SQL Sever connections.
When dbclose() is invoked, the entry is removed from the array. When
dbexit() is called, the array is used to close all connections that remain
open. If two COM components or ISAPI extension DLLs are not working
together, the DB-Library environment may not be set up correctly, and may
become corrupted unexpectedly. If you add vendor components to this
environment, synchronization of the DB-Library environment becomes very
difficult.
<P>
Within a SQL Server XPROC you do not have to call dbinit() or dbexit()
because it was called by SQL Server process at startup. The environment has
already been initialized with configuration parameters set by SQL Server.
It is difficult to find out what values have been set; it is not possible
to change these values. For example, the maximum open DBPROCESS
configuration value is set based on the "user connections" SQL Server
configuration value. There are some DB-Library calls available to query
these configuration values. Access to these global calls must be thread
safe and synchronized. For example, the dbsetmaxprocs() call is one that
must be synchronized. For more information about writing ODBC-based XPROCS
see the Samples\ODS\XP_ODBC sample that is included with the Microsoft SQL
Server Programmer's Toolkit (PTK).
<P>
ODBC 3.0 corrects many environment problems by localizing the HENV pointer.
Each component can call SQLAllocEnv(). ODBC 3.0 also has a new feature
called Connection Pooling. The MTS documentation suggests that you open the
connection, do your work and close the connection as quickly as possible.
This design model leads to increased scalability of your MTS components.
<P>
To handle messages received from the SQL Server, DB-Library uses a callback
model and ODBC uses a message retrieval model. This makes DB-Library
difficult to integrate into a class/component design. You must install the
per-process error and message handlers and make a call to dbsetuserdata()
and give it the proper "this or me" pointer. Then in your error or message
handler you can use the dbgetuserdata() call to retrieve the proper
pointer. This approach can leave gaps in your error and message handling.
If you install a global error or message handler, you can easily replace a
previously installed handler. You do not get a valid DBPROCESS until you
are logged in to SQL Server. This makes it difficult to set or establish a
design which allows you to capture errors prior to the dbopen call.
<P>
The ODBC model of direct retrieval allows you to handle all errors and
messages inline, where they are encountered. This lends itself to class and
component design as well as the "throw" construct. If you use the throw
operator in a DB-Library error or message handler you will cause internal
DB-Library routines to be skipped and subsequently cause DB- Library
(client) hangs. You simply can not throw reliably from any callback
function.
<P>
The SQL-DMO, ESQL for C, and VBSQL products are currently based on the
DB-Library. The issues discussed earlier are valid considerations for
developing scalable business solutions.
<P>
Currently the Microsoft Transaction Server Context object does not handle
transactional operations for DB-Library components. If you are developing
components with MTS you should use ODBC. Transactions are not maintained
for DB-Library connections.
<P>
This is not a complete description of issues that you may experience when
developing scalable solutions for Microsoft SQL Server using DB-Library or
DB-Library-based connectivity methods (such as SQL-DMO). You should consult
the Microsoft Knowledge Base for additional reference information.
<P>
Other issues regarding the dbsettime(),dbgettime(), and dbsetlogintime()
calls are not directly covered here, but are worth considering. For
additional information, consult the SQL Server Books Online.
<P>
It is highly recommended you use ODBC or OLEDB to develop extensible
components. ODBC and OLEDB have been redesigned with scalability in mind.
They present a better development environment than that offered by DB-
Library and should therefore be considered for all such development
projects.
