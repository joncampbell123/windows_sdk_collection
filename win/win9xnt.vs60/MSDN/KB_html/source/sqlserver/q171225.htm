The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SQL Server, versions 4.2x, 6.0, and 6.5
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Attempting to connect to SQL Server on a stand-alone computer or a laptop
computer with no network connections may fail with the following error
message:
<P>
<PRE>   Unable to connect: SQL Server is unavailable or does not exist.
   Specified SQL server not found.

</PRE>This error may occur during installation, or during subsequent attempts to
connect to the server.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
By default, client connections to SQL Server are made over a network
protocol. Without a simulated network connection, the connection to SQL
Server cannot be made unless a local named pipes connection is forced.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To simulate network connectivity, install the MS Loopback Adapter according
to the following steps for the version of Windows NT Server you are using:
<P>
Windows NT Server 4.0:

<OL><P><LI>In Control Panel Network, click the Adapters tab and then click Add.

<P><LI>From the list, select the MS Loopback Adapter.
<P>
</OL>Windows NT Server 3.x:

<OL><P><LI>In Control Panel Network, click Add Adapter.

<P><LI>From the Network Adapter Card menu, select MS Loopback Adapter.
<P>
</OL>The Windows NT installation CD is required. If you are using the IPX/SPX
protocol, a frame type of 802.3 is the default, and should be accepted. For
TCP/IP configurations, specify an IP address of 100.100.100.001 and a
subnet mask of 255.255.255.000. You will need to restart Windows NT Server
for this change to become effective.
<P>
If you are unable to install the MS Loopack Adapter, shut down the
workstation service (through Control Panel Services) to force a local named
pipes connection to be made during installation. Be aware that this
approach extends the installation time considerably. After the server is
installed, you can restart the workstation services. For subsequent
connections, you can force a local named pipes connection to the server by
not specifying the server name at connection time. You may also specify
".", or "(local)" as the server name in ISQL/w and in SQL Enterprise
Manager when registering the server. Alternatively, you can add an advanced
entry in the client configuration utility, specifying ".", or "(local)" as
the connection string for the server name.
<P>
For 16-bit applications, the MS Loopback Adapter is required. For more
information, see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../sqlserver/q130745.htm">Q130745</A></B>
   TITLE     : Connecting to Standalone SQL Server Using 16-bit Apps.

</PRE></OL>If you have removed all network support and stopped the workstation service, but
still continue to get the Unable to connect error, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>From a command prompt, type the following:
<P>
   cd \sql\binn
   setup /t RegistryRebuild = On
<P>
   NOTE: For SQL Server version 6.0, you can use either = On or = True for
   the Setup command line.
<P>
   NOTE: For SQL Server version 6.5, the default directory is \Mssql\Binn.
<P>
   NOTE: Be sure to type the Setup command exactly as indicated, including
   capitalization. There must be a space on both sides of the equal sign.

<P><LI>Build your master. When the retry dialog appears, task out and setup an
   advanced client config as the server name, named pipes, ".". Then press
   the retry button in SQL Server setup.

<P><LI>Once you have a valid master built, run the upgrade to ensure all
   scripts are active. This may again encounter the login error. Reset the
   client configuration advanced entry.
