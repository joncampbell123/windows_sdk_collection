<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SQL Server, version 6.5
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you make a trusted connection to a SQL Server using the 16-bit Multi-
protocol Netlibrary on a Windows for Workgroups client computer, which is
simultaneously logged on to a Microsoft domain and a NetWare network, the
client computer is inappropriately requested to supply domain credentials.
This occurs even if the connection is forced over named pipes
(ncacn_np:servername).
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, do one of the following:

<UL><LI>Enter in the domain credentials at each connection
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Remove the NetWare network shell from the client computer.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SQL Server
version 6.5. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The multi-protocol network library uses the features of the Windows NT RPCs
to pass domain credentials to the server when making integrated security
connections to SQL Server. This is useful if a non-Microsoft client, such
as a NetWare client, needs to make an integrated security connection to SQL
Server.
<P>
If the Windows for Workgroups client has not logged into the Microsoft
domain, then a Domain Credentials dialog box is displayed prompting the
user for a domain, user ID and password.
<P>
If the Windows for Workgroups client successfully logs on to the Microsoft
domain, the domain credentials are passed at the time of the connection and
the Domain Credentials dialog is not displayed.
<P>
If the Windows for Workgroups client has a NetWare network shell installed
as a second network, and has logged on to and validated by the Microsoft
network, then the Domain Credentials is displayed inappropriately.
