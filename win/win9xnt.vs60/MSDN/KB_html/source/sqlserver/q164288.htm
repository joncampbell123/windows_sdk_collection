The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SQL Server, version 6.5
</UL> 
BUG #: 16372 (Windows NT: 6.5)
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Replication filter stored procedures created in Microsoft SQL Server 6.0
are not upgraded during the upgrade process to Microsoft SQL Server 6.5.
<P>
Because these procedures are not upgraded, any articles that rely on these
procedures may not have their replication jobs processed. No error is
provided by replication when running the filter procedure under these
conditions. The upgrade process (either by an actual upgrade using
Setup.exe or LOAD DATABASE) should provide a message in the SQL Server
errorlog or Upgrad1b.out file (found in the Mssql\Install directory)
indicating a problem upgrading a replication filter procedure.
<P>
NOTE: Any procedure not upgraded will be listed by name. The error does
not indicate it is a replication filter procedure.
<P>
NOTE: In Microsoft SQL Server 6.0 and 6.5, a replication filter stored
procedure is designated in sysobjects with a type = 'RF' value.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To properly upgrade any replication filter procedure, you must drop and re-
create the replication filter procedure. There are basically two
techniques to properly re-create a replication filter procedure:

<UL><LI>Drop and re-create the article that is associated with the procedure
   using SQL Enterprise Manager. Specifying a restriction clause when
   creating the article automatically generates a filter stored procedure.

<LI>Manually drop and re-create the procedure by using the Transact-SQL
   commands DROP PROCEDURE and CREATE PROCEDURE. If you do not have a
   script to perform this operation, note that the syscomments table does
   not contain the keyword FOR REPLICATION necessary to identify a
   replication filter procedure when running CREATE PROCEDURE.
   Furthermore, if you do not use SQL Enterprise Manager to associate the
   filter procedure with an article, you can directly run
   master.dbo.sp_changearticle. See the Transact-SQL Reference for more
   information on running sp_changearticle to specify a filter procedure
   for an article.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SQL Server
version 6.5. This problem has been corrected in U.S. Service Pack 3 for
Microsoft SQL Server version 6.5. For more information, contact your
primary support provider.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Because SQL Server 6.5 Service Pack 3 is applied after upgrading from
SQL Server 6.0 to SQL Server 6.5, replication filter procedures are not
upgraded automatically by just applying the service pack. However, after
upgrading to SQL Server 6.5 and applying Service Pack 3, you can run the
stored procedure master.dbo.sp_db_upgrade '&lt;db&gt;' to upgrade all replication
filter procedures. Sp_db_upgrade is documented in the SQL Server Setup 6.0
book in Chapter 7, "Installation Troubleshooting."
<P>
If you load a database from SQL Server 6.0 with replication filter
procedures into a server running SQL Server 6.5 Service Pack 3, the
procedures will be upgraded correctly without requiring any further action.
