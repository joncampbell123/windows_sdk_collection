<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
SQL Server for Windows NT has a configuration parameter called Max Async IO
that can be viewed or changed with the sp_configure stored procedure. This
parameter controls the number of outstanding asynchronous disk input/output
(I/O) requests the SQL Server checkpoint and lazywriter threads use. The
default setting is 8, which is adequate for most systems. However, high
performance servers with intelligent disk subsystems may gain some
performance benefit by increasing this number.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
SQL Server for Windows NT uses the asynchronous I/O capability of the
Windows NT operating system. Examples of these are the Win32 API calls
ReadFile(), ReadFileEx(), WriteFile(), and WriteFileEx(). See the Microsoft
Windows Software Development Kit (Win32 SDK) for more information.
Asynchronous, or overlapped I/O, refers to the ability of a calling program
to issue an I/O request and without waiting for completion to continue with
another activity. When the I/O finishes, the operating system will notify
the program via a callback or other Win32 synchronization mechanism.
<P>
This has two main advantages. The first is it makes implementation easier
for an application designer, since the operating system can be used to
perform async I/O rather than having to simulate this capability in the
application. The second advantage is that the multiple outstanding I/O
requests can drive certain high performance disk subsystems at greater
performance levels than would be otherwise possible.
<P>
This is generally only possible with very high performance intelligent disk
subsystems. Examples include, but are not limited to, the Compaq SMART SCSI-
2 Array Controller, Mylex DAC960 Disk Array Subsystem, and the Tricord and
Sequent SCSI Intelligent Storage Subsystems. Contact your hardware vendor
for more information on how the particular disk subsystem handles Windows
NT async disk I/O.
<P>
The reason is that only these types of systems have the specific features
necessary to rapidly accept multiple async I/O requests from a Win32
application such as SQL Server. On these systems increasing the Max Async
IO parameter of SQL Server can result in performance improvements during
very disk intensive operations. The actual setting used for this parameter
and the resultant performance increase will vary depending on the exact
hardware and database I/O profile. It should not be set arbitrarily high,
since inordinate async I/O consumes system resources.
<P>
Please see article <B><A href="../win32sdk/q98893.htm">Q98893</A></B> "INF: Limit on the Number of Bytes Written
Asynchronously" for more information.
<P>
It is recommended the optimum value be determined empirically for a given
situation using either the Microsoft TPC-B Benchmark Kit or a customer-
specific benchmark. The procedure would be to take a test run with the
default of 8, then increase the parameter slowly while taking subsequent
test runs. When no further performance increase is noted, the optimum value
has been found. In the absence of any empirical testing, it should be left
at the default.
<P>
NOTE: Non-specialized disk subsystems will not benefit from increasing this
parameter, and the default setting will be adequate.
<P>
The reason for the performance increase can be seen by considering three
different types of disk subsystems. The first is a non-intelligent
controller attached to four disk drives. The second is four non-intelligent
controllers, each attached to a single disk drive. The third is a single
intelligent controller attached to four disk drives.
<P>
First, consider how a data transfer occurs with a single controller and
four drives. In the outbound transfer sequence, the device driver transfers
a buffer of data to the controller's on-board buffer. This takes place very
rapidly via DMA, shared memory, or programmed I/O, typically in a few
hundred microseconds at typical bus rates. Then the controller (under
varying amounts of device driver assistance) must command the necessary
seek operations from the drive that can take up to 50 milliseconds, which
is hundreds of times longer than the bus-to-controller transfer. Following
this, the actual data is transferred from the controller buffer to the disk
drive at the transfer rate determined by the drive type. There may also be
rotational latency involved prior to starting the transfer. During this
interval, in many systems the device driver and the task which called it
must simply wait for the hard drive. Operations cannot be performed on the
second and subsequent drives until the first drive finishes, because the
controller does not have the necessary logic to keep track of multiple
pending operations.
<P>
In the case of four controllers (each attached to its own drive) if Windows
NT or Windows NT Server striping is used, a transfer sequence can
immediately begin on the second or subsequent controller/drive. In this
case the four drives can independently be in different phases of the
transfer since each has its own controller to keep track of this. Using
WinNT async I/O in this hardware configuration can be beneficial since a
pool of outstanding I/Os can be built up, which the drive subsystem can
process in parallel four at a time. Since the rate at which the drive
subsystem processes the requests can vary, it may be useful to build up a
pool of outstanding requests from SQL NT in order to ensure the subsystem
is used to capacity. Depending on many system-specific factors, it may be
useful to increase the SQL NT Max Async IO parameter from 8 to a higher
number to take advantage of this.
<P>
The expansion capacity of most systems precludes using a controller per
drive. However, technology advances now make it possible to effectively
include the capability of multiple non-intelligent controllers in a single
intelligent controller. In this case, the single controller may connect to
2 to 16 drives. It can rapidly accept multiple I/O requests from the device
driver, maintaining effectively simultaneous transfer operations to the
attached drives, which are usually striped in a RAID array. In this
situation, depending on the capability and configuration of the controller,
increasing the SQL NT Max Async IO parameter could increase performance.
The actual value used will vary depending on the server and controller and
within a given server/controller by disk subsystem configuration and within
a certain disk subsystem configuration by I/O characteristics of the
application. For this reason using the Microsoft TPC-B Benchmark Kit is
recommended, which can provide an objective number for improvements to be
measured. This benchmark can also be customized to more closely represent
the intended application.
<P>
The threads which comprise SQL NT use async disk I/O for both normal
transfers as well as batch and lazywriter transfers. Lazywriter is a SQL NT
thread that exists beginning on version 4.21. Its purpose is to flush dirty
cache pages in the background and maintain a list of readily-available
free cache pages. (See the 4.21 Release Notes for more information.)
<P>
The Max Async IO parameter does not limit the number of outstanding async
I/Os from non-batch and non-lazywriter transfers, because these rarely
accumulate an excessive number of I/Os. This contrasts with the
checkpoint/lazywriter threads, which more typically need to process larger
amounts of data when flushing dirty cache pages. The parameter prevents the
I/O subsystem from being flooded with an excessive number of outstanding
requests when the checkpoint/lazywriter threads become active. You can
monitor the number of outstanding SQL Server read and write requests using
performance monitor.
<P>
The term "batch I/O" refers to a group of async I/Os the checkpoint or
lazywriter threads attempt to process at a time. For example, if the Max
Async IO parameter is set to 8, then the maximum number of IOs in a single
batch these threads attempt will be 8. A batch, in this case, does not
consist of a single 8 page I/O, but rather 8 asynchronous single-page I/Os.
<P>
When considering such matters, do not overemphasize the importance of
physical and system-layer performance tuning. In most cases the performance
increases available from other areas such as index, query, and database
design will be much greater, and less expensive to achieve. We encourage
prioritizing examination of these areas above that of the system area.
<P>
The allowed upper limit for the Max Async IO parameter varies depending on
the version of SQL Server for Windows NT. Version 4.20 and 4.21 allowed an
essentially unlimited value, which was reduced to 50 for version 4.21A.
This was done to prevent accidental mis-configuration to an unreasonable
value. The value 50 is higher than most current high-performance disk
subsytems can benefit from. However, if unforeseen technical advances
develop that would necessitate increasing this limit beyond 50, it can be
done using the following technique.
<P>
NOTE: This should not be done unless you have an expert level of system and
SQL knowledge.
