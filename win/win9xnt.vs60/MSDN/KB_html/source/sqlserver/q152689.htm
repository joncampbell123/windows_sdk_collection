The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SQL Server, versions 4.21 and 6.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you upgrade from Microsoft SQL Server 4.21 to 6.0, you may encounter
errors referencing "MSVCRT20.DLL". This file is used by a number of
Microsoft applications as well as third-party applications. The
MSVCRT20.DLL is a Visual C++ runtime dynamic link library (DLL); it could
be in use by another process at the time you are attempting to install SQL
Server.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
While setting up or upgrading  SQL Server, it is recommended that no other
applications be running, or at least close any applications that may be
using MSVCRT20.DLL. Microsoft Office Manager, mail packages and other
desktop applications may be using this file. Using the Task Manager in
Windows NT, make sure all applications are closed before you attempt to run
the SQL Server setup program.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The SQL Server 6.0 setup program uses this file (MSVCRT20.DLL) as part of
the setup routine.
<P>
This file is also copied to the MSSQL\BINN Directory as part of the file
installation during setup. You may also find these files installed in
Winnt35\System32 (on Windows NT) and to Windows\System (on Windows 95). It
is possible that during setup of another product, this file has been marked
as read-only; this will cause the SQL Server setup to stop while attempting
to overwrite this file.
<P>
If the setup program tries to copy a DLL over another DLL that has the same
name while that DLL is in use by another program, the setup program will
stop. Renaming or deleting MSVCRT20.DLL will also resolve this issue; any
program attempting to use the file will fail to load allowing SQL setup to
successfully write to this file.
<P>
<P>
In addition, it is possible that the WIN32s version of this file may have
been installed since the last time the SQL Server setup program was run.
This may result in the error "Can't find entry point to MSVCRT20.DLL" or
"This version of MSVCRT20.DLL is only intended for Win32s".
<P>
