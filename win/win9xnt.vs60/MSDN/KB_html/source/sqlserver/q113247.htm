<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:
<P>
<PRE>  - Microsoft SQL Server version 4.2 for OS/2
</PRE> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When an error occurs while dumping to tape on an OS/2 SQL Server, an error
message similar to the following is written to the SQL Server error log:
<P>
<PRE>   Sytos tape error 11 in module
   S:\dbms\os2\ksource\strmio\tbs.c at line 1978.

</PRE>However, the error number in the message above does not match the error
numbers published by Sytron in their documentation. This is because these
error numbers are related to the OS/2 Tape Subsystem.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Sytos error codes returned by the SQL Server software in the error log
are from the OS/2 tape subsystem. The following table contains the error
number (in decimal) and a short description. In many cases, finding the
error returned by the driver will allow you to narrow down the problem.
<P>
For example, the error message above indicates that the tape is write-
protected. The module name and line number refers to the location in the
SQL Server source file where the error occurred.
