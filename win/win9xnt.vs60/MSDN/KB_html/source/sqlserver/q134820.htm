The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SQL Server, version 4.21
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
NULL column values may be updated when you use SQL Transfer Manager or the
SELECT INTO statement to move data, due to a nullable user-defined data
type having a future-only default binding at the source.
<P>
This is the expected behavior because the tables you are creating use the
defaults as bound.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When SQL Transfer Manager generates the creation script for the
destination, it first creates the default data types, then any defaults
that need to be bound to the user-defined data types; it then binds them to
the data types and creates the tables.
<P>
SELECT INTO creates the new table from current settings which show the
user-defined data type as having a default bound to it.
<P>
In the following scenario, the data movement causes the firing of the
user-defined default, replacing NULL values with the default value:
<P>
<P><h3>Source</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create a user-defined data type; nullable.

<P><LI>Create a table which uses the new data type, making the user-defined
   data type column nullable also.

<P><LI>Insert data into the table, make sure to add rows with NULL values for
   the specified user-defined data type column.

<P><LI>Create a default and bind it only to the user-defined data type, using
   the future only option.

<P><LI>Create a new table, similar to step 2, and compare the cdefault and
   tdefault columns in syscolumns and systypes, respectively.
<P>
   The new table should contain a column binding and the original table
   from step 2 should not. Accordingly, when you insert values into the
   second table, you should be able to cause the default to fire, where
   as it should never fire on the first table.
<P>
   To retrieve a list of user-defined data types that are in use and
   have defaults bound to them but not to specific columns, the following
   select statement may help:
<P>
<P><PRE>      select object_name(c.id), c.name, t.name
<PRE></PRE>      from    syscolumns c, systypes t
      where t.tdefault != c.cdefault and
            t.usertype = c.usertype and
            (c.cdefault = 0 or t.tdefault = 0)

</PRE></OL><h3>Destination</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Establish a new clean and empty database.
<P>
   Once both the source and destination are prepared, use SQL Transfer
   Manager to login to both the source and destination. Do not select the
   all objects option. Select the include dependencies, include drops, and
   include data options. Transfer the table from source to destination.
<P>
   At the destination you will see that the user-defined data type was
   created, then the default bound to it, and finally the table was
   created. This can be verified in the script which SQL Transfer Manager
   built.
<P>
   When the data is moved, the NULL data from the source invokes the
   default, and the data changes to reflect the default value.
<P>
<P>
</OL><h3>Work Around</h3>
 
<P>
In order to move data which falls into the 'future only' scenario
without modifying the NULL values, you need to generate scripts from the
SQL Object Manager. Modify the scripts so the defaults are not bound, then
create the new objects at the destination. Use SQL Transfer Manager, but do
not include drops to move the data.
<P>
By not including drops, you avoid the recreation of the objects which
you have previously completed. Once the data is moved, bind the defaults
accordingly.
<P>
For the SELECT INTO case, you need to identify the user-defined data type
bindings and unbind them before you perform the command. Be sure you
replace the bindings correctly after the SELECT INTO operation is complete.
<P>
You should place the database in single user mode while you complete
the process so other data modifications that depend on the default are not
inadvertently affected.
