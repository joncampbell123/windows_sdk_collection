The information in this article applies to:
<P>
<PRE>  - Microsoft SQL Server version 4.2 for OS/2
  - Microsoft SQL Server versions 4.2, 4.21, and 4.21a
</PRE>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
There is a known problem with the Compaq IDA-2 disk controller that
can cause SQL Server data corruption.
<P>
Compaq has confirmed that under high levels of stress, the Compaq
IDA-2 controller may cause data corruption due to a firmware problem
related to write-caching. The symptom is typically a 605 error, often on
syslogs:
<P>
<PRE>   Attempt to fetch logical page &lt;page&gt; in database &lt;db name&gt; belongs
   to object &lt;object name&gt; not to object &lt;object name&gt;

</PRE>The suggested solution is to run Compaq IDA-2 firmware level 2.60 or
later. An interim solution prior to updating is to turn off IDA-2
write-caching.
<P>
This firmware update is available in two versions:

<UL><LI>It can be downloaded from Compaq's web page at www.compaq.com. The
   upgrade changes are saved in the reserved area of each hard disk
   attached to the controller. In the event that it cannot be read from one
   disk, it is read from the next disk. If it cannot be read from any of
   the attached disks, the controller will revert to the previous version
   and the corruption may return.
<P>
   Upon replacement of any failed drive, Compaq recommends that the
   upgrade be performed again so that the new firmware is recorded on the
   new drive, thus preventing reversion to the previous state.

<LI>The firmware update is also available as a new firmware chip from
   Compaq or a Compaq dealer.
<P>
</UL>A separate problem was found with the Compaq IDA-E expansion
controller. This controller isn't as widely used, and is for attaching
an expansion chassis of hard disk drives to a SystemPro. In this case,
firmware version 1.18 or later is required.
<P>
The Compaq Diagnostic disk has a program called "inspect" that can be
used to determine what firmware version the system is running.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
With the above problem corrected, the Compaq IDA-2 is the only write-
caching controller currently known that potentially will not jeopardize SQL
Server data integrity. Compaq believes it has eliminated all known causes
of cache-induced problems in the IDA-2 design. It has on-board battery
backup, mirrored RAM, and they intercept in hardware all causes of bus and
controller reset, including the reboot switch.
