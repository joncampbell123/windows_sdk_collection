<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
A deadlock is a condition where 2 (or more) processes attempt to access a
resource that the other holds a lock on. Since each process has a request
for the other's resource, neither process can be completed. When a deadlock
is detected, SQL Server will rollback the command that has the least
processing time and return a 1205 message to the application. However, a
1205 error is not fatal and may not cause the batch to be terminated.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In some instances, a deadlock condition will cause a DB-Library (DB-Lib)
command (such as dbsqlexec, dbsqlok, or dbresults) to return FAIL. It is
always the responsibility of the program to check the return codes from
each DB-Lib command. If FAIL is returned by one of these DB-Lib commands,
the program should cancel the batch and not attempt to continue. In some
cases, it is possible to continue execution of subsequent commands in the
batch. However, because a deadlock situation occurred and the command that
caused it was rolled back, later commands in the batch will probably fail
with a more serious error, such as an object not found.
<P>
In other instances, a deadlock condition will not cause a DB-Lib command to
return FAIL. To handle this condition, the program must check for message
1205 in the message handler and use the dbsetuserdata function to
communicate this to your application (an example can be found in Chapter 4
"DB-Library Functions" in the SQL Server "Programmer's Reference for C"
under dbsetuserdata). The program must then check for the deadlock
indicator after every DB-Library call and should cancel the batch if a
deadlock is detected.
<P>
While it may seem unnecessary to cancel a batch after receiving a 1205
deadlock message, it is necessary because the server does not always abort
the batch in a deadlock situation. If the batch is not canceled, any
attempt to submit a new batch may result in a DB-Library error 10038
"Results Pending."
<P>
You can find a description of deadlocking and an example of how to detect a
deadlock condition in "Appendix E Maximizing Consistency and Concurrency"
in the SQL Server for Windows NT "Programmer's Reference for C" or in the
"Maximizing Database Consistency and Concurrency" manual for SQL Server for
OS/2 version 4.2b.
