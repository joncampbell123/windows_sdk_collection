<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article is an expansion of the description of the sp_configure 'open
objects' parameter found in the Microsoft SQL Server Books Online and
reference manuals.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The sp_configure 'open objects' parameter controls the number of database
objects which can be open concurrently. Database objects are those
objects defined in the sysobjects table: tables, views, rules, stored
procedures, defaults, and triggers.
<P>
At server startup, SQL Server builds a pool of descriptor data structures
in memory that are used to describe database objects as they are
referenced. The number of descriptors built is equal to the number of
sp_configure 'open objects.' Each time a database object is referenced for
the first time, SQL Server takes one of the descriptors from this free pool
and allocates it to the specific object.
<P>
If multiple tasks reference the same object at the same time, it is still
considered one open object. For example, if two tasks issue the following
command at the same time:
<P>
<PRE>   update table_a set cola = @variable

</PRE>there is only one descriptor allocated to table_a which would be
considered one open object. If, however, table_a had an update trigger,
then a second descriptor would be allocated to the trigger which would
count as a second open object.
<P>
Each allocated descriptor has a use counter which indicates how many
concurrent queries are referencing the object it defines. The use count
gets incremented by one at the start of a query, and decremented by one by
the end of the query. In our example above, the table_a descriptor would
have a use count of 2 until the two queries finished; it would then be
decremented to 0.
<P>
Once the free pool of descriptors has been used up, SQL Server starts
reusing inactive descriptors when it needs to allocate a new descriptor. An
inactive descriptor is one whose use count is zero. The first time SQL
Server has to reuse a descriptor it issues the following message in the
error log:
<P>
<PRE>   Warning: OPEN OBJECTS parameter may be too low;
   attempt was made to free up descriptors in localdes().
   Run sp_configure to increase parameter value.

</PRE>SQL Server repeats this message after each 1,000 times it has to reuse
a descriptor. If a system administrator notices these messages being issued
frequently in the error log, they should increase the sp_configure 'open
objects' parameter.
