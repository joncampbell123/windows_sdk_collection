<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article details the steps to set up bidirectional transaction-based
replication using a simple conflict resolution mechanism (also known as
reconciliation), based on record ownership. It also discusses some
situations that are handled by the custom stored procedures as well as
recommendations on issues to be handled by the application.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Replication in SQL Server 6.x</h3>
 
<P>
Replication in SQL Server 6.x is intended to distribute logically read-only
copies of data to multiple servers to offload report processing load out of
an online transaction processing (OLTP) server. SQL Server replication also
assumes that the data at the subscriber is always in sync with the data at
the publisher. This constrains the data that is obtained as a result of
subscribing to a publication to be static at the subscriber. SQL Server
replication is intended to satisfy this class of applications that are
designed for near real-time, static data at the subscriber.
<P>
Another class of applications that can use SQL Server replication is the
one that depends on partitioned data. In this case, the servers own a
disjointed set of data and each server replicates the data it owns to the
other server. Effectively, the tables are published with a restriction
clause to achieve horizontal partitioning and do not update data that is
owned by the other server. This partitioning scheme implements two
completely disjointed replication streams, thereby enhancing data
availability.
<P>
However, some applications may require completely distributed data. Though
SQL Server replication is not intended for such an update anywhere
scenario, it provides the basic framework for implementing a two-way or
bidirectional replication setup, using custom stored procedures and filter
procedures. However, there are some constraints on the schema and the
transactions. It relies on the procedure logic or manual intervention to
detect and resolve conflicts. This setup using bidirectional replication is
intended to be used only with applications that yield themselves well to
these constraints.
<P>
Though this article uses an sample setup of bidirectional replication
between two servers, it can easily be expanded to multiple servers. Also,
the concepts discussed here apply to both SQL Server 6.0 and 6.5, though
the features available are limited in SQL Server 6.0. For example, text and
image columns cannot participate in transaction-based replication. Hence,
appropriate modifications need to be done to the publication definition or
custom stored procedures to handle the different cases.
<P>
<P><h3>Assumptions</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>The sample table is assumed to have the following structure:
<P>
<P><PRE>      create table twoway
      (
<PRE></PRE>      PKcol       int primary key not null,
      Data       int)

   You have to add a "replicate_flag" to indicate if a particular record
   needs be replicated or not. If this field is 1, any changes to this
   record will be replicated. Also, this flag will indicate ownership of
   the record -- if this flag is 1 on a server, it should be 0 on the other
   server. The server on which it is 1 is considered the "owner server" for
   the record, thereby establishing ownership (and consequently, ability to
   modify) at a record level. Any server that needs to modify this record
   needs to first obtain ownership of the record.

</PRE><P><LI>All application modifications will insert with the "replicate_flag" set
   to 1, or modify (update/delete) the record after obtaining ownership, by
   executing "update &lt;table&gt; set replicate_flag =1 where PKcol =
   &lt;PK_value&gt;" prior to executing the real update/delete command. For
   example, if a delete operation is to be done on a record, then, the
   replicate_flag must be updated to 1 before the actual delete command is
   executed on the record. This update must happen in the same transaction
   as the delete/update operation.

<P><LI>You have to use Custom Stored Procedures for Replication to handle
   insert/update/delete at the subscriber -- this procedure will always set
   "replicate_flag" to 0, thereby signifying that this is a replica of data
   owned by another server; it also avoids re-applying transactions or
   "looping" on replicated data. Often, an Update command is replicated as
   a Delete command followed by an Insert command - the procedures will be
   coded to handle cases where the delete part or insert part of an update
   command is masked out due to filtering. These procedures will also
   handle cases where the logreader generates an update command in the
   place of a delete/insert pair at the publisher. The custom procedures
   will have to be created on the subscriber -- assume the names of the
   procedures are:
<P>
<P><PRE>      sp_twoway_i -- for insert
      sp_twoway_u -- for update
      sp_twoway_d -- for delete
</PRE>
<P><LI>No additional effort is required on a setup with empty tables at both
   ends during the setup; if the tables contain data prior to publishing,
   use manual synchronization. Synchronize the tables this way: data in the
   tables should contain replicate_flag=1; Data from one server should be
   BCPed into the other server with replicate_flag=0. This will establish
   the respective servers as "owners" of existing records.
<P>
</OL><h3>Constraints</h3>
 
<P>
These constraints are based on the assumptions in the previous section.

<OL><P><LI>Each record in the table is owned by one server at any time. Custom
   Stored Procedures for Replication should be coded to
   insert/update/delete records at subscriber to automatically indicate the
   data is a replica. The application should insert with replicate_flag=1.

<P><LI>The application will take ownership of a record prior to modification.
   This should be done within the scope of the transaction doing the
   modification to eliminate the possibility of conflicts.

<P><LI>The application should handle unique primary key values for inserts by
   submitting the inserts to one server or have disjoint values on
   different servers. This will avoid conflicts on inserts -- otherwise,
   the distribution task may fail attempting to insert duplicate values or
   depending on the procedures, it may just update the information at the
   subscriber. This may be misinterpreted as missing data.

<P><LI>The replication mechanism should be nearly real-time. This will almost
   serialize operations and thereby reduce the possibility of a conflict;
   in cases where a conflict arises, we will reconcile using custom
   procedures. It is not suitable for servers replicating over a slow LAN
   or WAN network or over RAS, largely due to the possibility of delays in
   distribution.
<P>
</OL>Not all applications are suitable for this or can work with these
constraints. You should set up and test this procedure prior to deployment
for possible conflicts and to ensure that the logic for satisfactory
conflict resolution is added to the custom stored procedures and the
application. If your application can work with these constraints, the
following steps can be used to setup bidirectional replication.
<P>
Create custom stored procedures on both the servers involved. The following
sample uses a simple reconciliation logic. The application can do data
modification only on owned records (replicate_flag=1) or it will take
ownership of the record prior to modification. Custom procedures will not
update or delete data that is not a replica (replicate_flag=0). In such
cases, update and delete commands will be ignored.
<P>
<P><h3>Create the Procedures in the Subscribing Database</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>/* custom procedure for insert */
</PRE></OL>create proc sp_twoway_i @PKcol int, @Data int, @repl_flag smallint
as
begin
<PRE>   set nocount on
   /* handle condition where delete part of update is filtered */
   if exists (select * from twoway where PKcol = @PKcol)
   begin
      update twoway
      set Data = @Data, replicate_flag=0
      where PKcol=@PKcol
   end
   else
   begin
      insert into twoway values (@PKcol,@Data,0)
   end
</PRE>end
go
<P>
<PRE>/* custom procedure for update */
</PRE>create proc sp_twoway_u @PKcolNew int, @Data int,
@replicate_flag smallint, @PKcol int
as
begin
<PRE>   set nocount on
   declare @flag smallint

   /* Update data only if this is subscribed data */
   /* replicate_flag will be 0 for subscribed data */
   if exists (select * from twoway where PKcol=@PKcol)
   begin
      select @flag = replicate_flag from twoway
      where PKcol=@PKcol
      if (@flag=0)
      begin
         update twoway
         set PKcol=@PKcolNew, Data=@Data,replicate_flag=0
         where PKcol=@PKcol
      end
   end
   else
   /* handle cases where delete logreader generates */
   /* update for delete/insert */
   begin
      insert twoway values (@PKcolNew,@Data,0)
   end
</PRE>end
go
<P>
<PRE>/* custom procedure for delete */
</PRE>create proc sp_twoway_d @PKcol int
as
begin
<PRE>   set nocount on
   /* Replication cannot update data owned by the site */
   /* data owned by the site will have replicate_flag = 1 */
   if exists (select * from twoway
      where PKcol = @PKcol and replicate_flag = 0)
   begin
      delete twoway where PKcol=@PKcol
   end
</PRE>end
go
 
<P>
Now that the table and the custom procedures have been created, set up
replication on the table using a horizontal partition and select the "Do
Nothing" option on the Auto-Generate Sync Scripts dialog box using the
following steps:

<OL><P><LI>from the Manage menu, choose Replication, and then from the drop-down
   menu that appears, choose Publications.

<P><LI>Select a database, and then click New. In the Edit Publications window,
   type a name, choose the table to be published and click Edit.
   
</OL>3. In the Manage Articles dialog box, specify the Restriction Clause as
<PRE>   replicate_flag = 1 on the Filters tab.
   
</PRE></OL>4. On the Scripts tab, under Data Replication Mechanism, click Custom
<PRE>   option for Insert/Update/Delete and specify the appropriate procedure name.
   For example, for insert, the entry similar to the following:
   
      call sp_twoway_i
   
</PRE>5. Now, click Generate. In the Auto-Generate Sync Scripts dialog box, under
<PRE>   If Existing Table Detected in Subscriber, select the Do Nothing option.
   This is required because the table will exist at the subscriber and will be
   published. On synchronization, the default Drop Table option will be unable
   to drop a published table.
   
</PRE>6. To finish the setup, click Auto-Generate, click OK, and then click Add.
<P>
The above steps must be performed on both servers. This will create the
publications on both servers. From each server, subscribe to the other
server's publication. If the tables do not contain any data, you may choose
either the Data Synchronization Automatically Applied or the No Data
Synchronization option in the Subscription Options dialog box. If the
tables will contain data prior to publishing, on each server, the
replication flag must be set to 1 and the primary key values must be
unique. In this case, choose the Data Synchronization Manually Applied by
Operator option and synchronize the tables as explained previously.
<P>
This will complete the setup of bidirectional replication with a very
simple reconciliation scheme. This sample procedure should be modified to
include any logic your specific application/design may require.
