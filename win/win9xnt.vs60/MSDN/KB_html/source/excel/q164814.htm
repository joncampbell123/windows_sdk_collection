The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 97, when you print a worksheet, one or more of the
following symptoms may occur:

<UL><LI>Drawing objects, AutoShapes, gridlines, charts, and other objects in the
   worksheet are not printed at all.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE>
<LI>Drawing objects, AutoShapes, charts, and other objects in the worksheet
   are not printed completely (they are truncated). For example, only part
   of an oval or rectangle is printed.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE>
<LI>Some gridlines or borders may not be printed.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
These problems may occur if one or more of the following conditions are
true:

<UL><LI>You print the worksheet with a printer resolution of 75 or 150 dots per
   inch (dpi).
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE>
<LI>The Print Object check box for the drawing object, AutoShape, or
   chart is cleared.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE>
<LI>The worksheet is formatted to print without gridlines.
<P>
</UL><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
In most cases you can work around these problems by increasing the printer
resolution. To do this, use the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Switch to the worksheet that you want to print.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Page Setup. Click the Page tab.

<P><LI>In the Print Quality list, click a print quality of 300 dpi or greater
   (for example, 300 dpi, 600 dpi, or 1200 dpi).

<P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
</OL>Repeat these steps for each worksheet that you want to print.
<P>
You can also change printer resolution by using the Printers icon in the
Control Panel. However, using this method does not change the resolution
for existing worksheets.
<P>
If increasing the printer resolution does not correct the problem, use one
or more of the following appropriate methods.
<P>
<P><h3>Printing Gridlines</h3>
 
<P>
To format a worksheet so that gridlines are printed, use the following
steps:

<OL><P><LI>Switch to the worksheet that contains gridlines that you want to print.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Page Setup, and then click the Sheet tab.

<P><LI>Click to select the Gridlines check box and click OK.
<P>
</OL>Repeat these steps for each worksheet that contains gridlines that you want
to print.
<P>
<P><h3>Printing Drawing Objects and AutoShapes</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>In the worksheet, click the object that you want to print.

<P><LI>On the Format menu, click the first menu command. This command changes
   depending on the object that is selected; for example, the command may
   be AutoShape or Text Box. Then, click the Properties tab.

<P><LI>Click to select the Print Object check box and click OK.
<P>
</OL>Repeat these steps for each drawing object and AutoShape in the worksheet
that you want to print.
<P>
<P><h3>Printing Charts</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>In the worksheet, right-click the background of the chart and click
   Format Chart Area on the shortcut menu.

<P><LI>Click the Properties tab.

<P><LI>Click to select the Print Object check box and click OK.
<P>
</OL>Repeat these steps for each chart in the worksheet that you want to print.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design of Microsoft Excel 97.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Because almost all printers that are available (as of early 1997) can print
at a resolution of 300 dpi or higher, Microsoft Excel 97 is optimized to
print at high resolutions, such as 300, 600, and 1200 dpi. When you print
using a high resolution, you can print finer lines, more complex shading,
and sharper-looking fonts.
<P>
When you use a printing resolution of 75 or 150 dpi, graphical objects may
not be printed correctly, or may not be printed.
