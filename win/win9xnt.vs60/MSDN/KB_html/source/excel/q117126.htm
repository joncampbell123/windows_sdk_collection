The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, version 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, version 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel version 5.0, a formula can refer to a range that spans
two or more sheets in a workbook. This is called a 3-D reference. You
cannot use a 3-D reference in an array formula. In addition, if you enter a
2-D reference in the 3-D reference syntax in an array formula, as in the
following example
<P>
<PRE>   =SUM(IF(Sheet1!A1:Sheet1!A3="a",1,0))

</PRE>NOTE: The above formula must be entered as an array formula. To enter a
formula as an array formula in Microsoft Excel for Windows, press
CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER. In Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, press
COMMAND+ENTER.
<P>
Note that if you use the same sheet name for both the starting cell and the
ending cell of the reference, as in the above example, Microsoft Excel will
treat this as a 2-D formula as long as that workbook remains open. However,
when you close and reopen the workbook, the formula is treated as a 3-D
reference and is calculated incorrectly.
<P>
Because the first and last sheet in this reference refers to the same
worksheet, it is not a 3-D reference. To create a formula that will be
correctly recalculated, you can use a 2-D reference as in the following
example:
<P>
<PRE>   Sheet1!A1:A3

</PRE><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, change the formula in cell A5 to a 2-D formula
as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   =SUM(IF(sheet1!A1:A3="a",1,0))

</PRE>NOTE: The above formula must be entered as an array formula. To enter a
formula as an array formula in Microsoft Excel for Windows, press
CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER. In Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, press
COMMAND+ENTER.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in
Microsoft Excel version 5.0c.
