<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition, if you hold down the COMMAND key
and drag a drawing object in a worksheet, the drawing object does not snap
to the gridlines in the worksheet. Instead, the shortcut menu for the
drawing object appears.
<P>
This problem does not occur in Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, version
5.x.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs because, in Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition, the
COMMAND key is used to display shortcut menus for drawing objects and
AutoShapes.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
There are two methods you can use to prevent this problem from occurring.
<P>
<P><h3>Method One</h3>
 
<P>
Instead of holding down the COMMAND key and then dragging the drawing
object, start dragging the drawing object and then, while still holding the
mouse button down, press and hold down the COMMAND key. When you do this,
the drawing object will snap to the gridlines, and you can move it with the
mouse. After the drawing object is in place, release the mouse button, and
then release the COMMAND key.
<P>
<P><h3>Method Two</h3>
 
<P>
You can force Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition to snap all drawing
objects to the gridlines by following these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Drawing toolbar, click the Draw menu, point to Snap, and click
   To Grid.

<P><LI>Move a drawing object.
<P>
</OL>When you move a drawing object, it automatically snaps to the gridlines in
the worksheet. To turn the feature off, click the Draw menu on the Drawing
toolbar, point to Snap, and click To Grid again.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design of Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh version 5.x, you can force a drawing
object to snap to the gridlines when it is moved by holding down the
COMMAND key while you move the object.
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition, however, this method may not work,
depending on when exactly you press the COMMAND key. If you press the
COMMAND key before moving the drawing object, the shortcut menu for the
object appears. If you press the COMMAND key after beginning to move the
drawing object, it moves and snaps to the gridlines in the worksheet.
