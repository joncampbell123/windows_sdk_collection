<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, when you click Shared Lists on the File menu, you
receive the following error message if the file is open as read-only:
<P>
<PRE>   Can't access read-only document '&lt;filename.xls&gt;'

</PRE>The Shared Lists dialog box does not open, and you cannot show the Conflict
History in the file.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs because when a file is open as read-only, you cannot
change the status of the Multi-User Editing feature in the file. When you
change the status of the Multi-User Editing feature in a file, Microsoft
Excel requires that you then save the file. When a file is open as read-
only, you cannot display the Shared Lists dialog box.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Although you cannot display the Shared Lists dialog box in a read-only
file, you can display the Conflict History by running the following
procedure in a Visual Basic module:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub Conflict_History()
      ' In the following commands, replace BOOK1.XLS
      ' with the name of the file that is open read-only
      Workbooks("BOOK1.XLS").Activate
      Workbooks("BOOK1.XLS").ShowConflictHistory = True
   End Sub

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Conflict History is a worksheet that contains information (such as
Date, Time, Cell Location, and Value) about conflicting cells in the
workbook as a result of multiple people editing the same file. To display
the Conflict History, do the following (the file must be open with read-
write protection):

<OL><P><LI>On the File menu, click Shared Lists.

<P><LI>Click the Editing tab.

<P><LI>Click the Show Conflict History check box, and click OK.
<P>
</OL>A Conflict History worksheet is inserted in your workbook with the
information about the conflicting cells on the worksheet.
