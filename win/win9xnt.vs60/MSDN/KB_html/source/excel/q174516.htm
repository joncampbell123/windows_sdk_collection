<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Excel 97 is available in two versions: a retail version that you
can install on any compatible computer, and an upgrade version that
requires that a qualifying product be installed on your computer or that
Disk 1 of the qualifying product be available when you run the Setup
program.
<P>
This article lists the products that qualify you to use the upgrade
version of Microsoft Excel 97. The retail version does not require a
qualifying product.

<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Qualifying product names are listed on the left and their version numbers
are listed on the right in the following table.
