The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0
<LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, if you use the Template Wizard to add information from 
an existing Microsoft Excel workbook to a database, a blank record (or 
partially blank record) may be added to the database. Also, Microsoft Excel 
provides no warning that a blank or incomplete record was added to the 
database.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
You may discover empty or incomplete records in your database if both of
the following conditions exist:

<UL><LI>You are using the Template Wizard to add information from an existing
   Microsoft Excel workbook to your database.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -and-
</PRE>
<LI>The workbook you are using to add information to the database is not
   arranged exactly the same as the template file that is linked to the
   database.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
In order for your database file to be updated correctly, make sure that any 
workbook you use to add information to a database is arranged exactly the 
same as the template file that is linked to the database.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To use the Template Wizard, you need to do all of the following:

<UL><LI>Create a workbook that contains the layout for the data.

<LI>Define a template based on the layout in the workbook.

<LI>Create or use an associated database.

<LI>Decide whether to consolidate existing data from separate workbooks.

<LI>Save the template and the database.
<P>
</UL>To automatically add data to the database file, open a workbook based on
the template you created with the wizard, type new data in the workbook,
and save the workbook.
<P>
You can merge data from other workbooks either when you create the template 
or after you create the template. If you want to merge data from a 
Microsoft Excel workbook, but you are unsure of which cells in the template 
file are linked to the database, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Open the template file created by the Template Wizard that is linked
   to the database.

<P><LI>On the Data menu, click Template Wizard.

<P><LI>In the Template Wizard, step 1 of 5, click Next.

<P><LI>In the Template Wizard, step 2 of 5, click Next.

<P><LI>In the Template Wizard, step 3 of 5, you will see a listing of all
   the cell references (sheet name as well as cell address) that are
   linked to the database.

<P><LI>Click Cancel to close the Template Wizard without any changes.
<P>
</OL>Make sure that the data you want to merge from your workbook uses the
same cell references (sheet name, as well as cell address) as those
listed in the Template Wizard, step 3 of 5.
<P>
If your workbook does not contain a worksheet that is named the same as
that listed in the Template Wizard, step 3 of 5, you may receive the
following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Unable to find data in workbook &lt;file name&gt;

</PRE></OL>This problem occurs because the Template Wizard is looking for a
specific worksheet in your workbook and is unable to locate one with the
same name as the sheet listed in the Template Wizard, step 3 of 5.
<P>
