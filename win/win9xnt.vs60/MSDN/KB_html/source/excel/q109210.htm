<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0c
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel versions 5.x and 7.0, when you initially insert a
Microsoft Excel workbook (by choosing Object from the Insert menu) into
another Microsoft Excel workbook, you may notice that

<UL><LI>Extra hidden windows are created.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>You are prompted to save the inserted workbook even when it does not
   seem necessary.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following information applies only when a workbook (for example,
TEST1.XLS) has initially been inserted into another workbook (for example,
TEST2.XLS) and the same session of Microsoft Excel is still running.

<OL><P><LI>The first time you insert a specific workbook (TEST1.XLS) into another
   specific workbook (TEST2.XLS) in Microsoft Excel, two hidden windows
   are created: one hidden window contains the inserted copy of TEST1.XLS,
   and the other window contains the separate TEST1.XLS, which has been
   opened and hidden. Note that both windows initially contain exactly the
   same contents.

<P><LI>When you save TEST2.XLS, any changes made to the inserted copy of
   TEST1.XLS are also saved. The separate copy of TEST1.XLS is not
   affected.

<P><LI>When you close Microsoft Excel, the program almost always prompts you
   to save the separate copy of TEST1.XLS. This is because during the
   process of inserting TEST1.XLS, the separate copy of that file was
   opened and hidden. Since this constitutes a change to the workbook,
   Microsoft Excel prompts you to save changes to the separate copy of
   TEST1.XLS.
<P>
   Choosing Yes saves the separate copy of TEST1.XLS with all the changes
   you made to the inserted copy of TEST1.XLS, but also saves it as hidden.
   Choosing No leaves the separate copy of TEST1.XLS unchanged.
<P>
   You should not be prompted to save the inserted copy of TEST1.XLS: this
   is done automatically when you save TEST2.XLS.
<P>
   When you restart Microsoft Excel and reopen TEST2.XLS, there are no
   hidden windows associated with TEST2.XLS, and you are not prompted to
   save TEST1.XLS at any time.
<P>
</OL><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Exit and restart Microsoft Excel.

<P><LI>In a new worksheet in a new workbook, enter the following value:
<P>
       A1: This is TEST1.XLS

<P><LI>Save the workbook as TEST1.XLS.

<P><LI>Exit and restart Microsoft Excel.

<P><LI>In a new worksheet in a new workbook (Book1), choose Object from
    the Insert menu.

<P><LI>In the Object dialog box, select the Create From File tab.

<P><LI>In the list of files, select TEST1.XLS. Choose OK to insert the
    workbook.

<P><LI>From the Window menu, choose Unhide.
<P>
    The Unhide dialog box contains two workbook names: TEST1.XLS and Book2.

<P><LI>In the Unhide dialog box, choose Cancel.

<P><LI>Save workbook Book1 as TEST2.XLS.
<P>
</OL>When you save TEST2.XLS, any changes made to the inserted copy of TEST1.XLS
are saved within the TEST2.XLS workbook. However, the separate copy of
TEST1.XLS is not affected.

<OL><P><LI>From the File menu, choose Exit.
<P>
</OL>You are prompted to save changes in TEST1.XLS. This is because TEST1.XLS,
which was originally saved "visible," has been opened and hidden as a
result of the insertion process. If you save changes in TEST1.XLS, the file
is saved "hidden" and you must unhide (by choosing Unhide from the File or
Window menu) TEST1.XLS when next you open it. You are not prompted to save
Book2.
