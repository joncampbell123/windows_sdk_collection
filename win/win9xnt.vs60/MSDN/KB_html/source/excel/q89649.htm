The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 4.0, 4.0a, 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, versions 4.0, 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If you are using Microsoft Excel versions 4.0 and later, and you open a 3-D
chart that was created in Microsoft Excel version 3.0, the chart may appear
smaller that than it did in Microsoft Excel version 3.0.
<P>
In Microsoft Excel version 3.0, charts are automatically scaled to fit
the chart window -- there is no option to control this scaling.
However, in Microsoft Excel version 4.0 and later, you have the option to
control this scaling. Since this option is not available in Microsoft
Excel version 3.0, when you open a chart created in Microsoft Excel
3.0 in later versions, the chart will be opened without this option
enabled, and it will appear smaller it did in Microsoft Excel version 3.0.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel versions 4.0 and later, if the Auto Scaling check box
(located in the 3-D View dialog box) is selected, your chart will be scaled
to fill the chart window. When you disable this option, the x-axis and
the y-axis will be the same size. This results in the chart appearing
smaller than scaled charts.
<P>
In Microsoft Excel versions 3.0, 4.0, and later, you can format 3-D charts
with the options that are available in the 3-D View dialog box. You
can use these options to display your chart in a right angle axes view
or a in customized perspective angle view.
<P>
In Microsoft Excel version 3.0, both of these view angles are scaled
to fit the chart window. However, in Microsoft Excel versions 4.0 and
later, the Auto Scaling option is only available when your chart is in a
right angle axes view. If you customized the perspective angle of your
chart, use the Height % Of Base box to change how your chart fills the
chart window.
<P>
To make your chart fill the chart window, use the appropriate method
below (depending on the view angle of your chart).
<P>
<P><h3>Right Angle Axes View</h3>
 
<P>
If your chart is displayed in a right angle axes view, you can make
your chart fill the entire chart window by enabling the Auto Scaling
option in the 3-D View dialog box:

<OL><P><LI>If the chart is a chart object on your worksheet, double-click the
   chart to bring it into a separate chart window.

<P><LI>From the Format menu, choose 3-D View.

<P><LI>Select the Auto Scaling check box.

<P><LI>Choose OK.
<P>
</OL><h3>Perspective View</h3>
 
<P>
If you chart is set to a customized angle, you can make your chart
fill the chart window by adjusting the number in the Height % Of Base
box (the lower the value, the shorter and wider your chart will be):

<OL><P><LI>If the chart is a chart object on your worksheet, double-click the
   chart to bring it into a separate chart window.

<P><LI>From the Format menu, choose 3-D View.

<P><LI>Enter a value lower than 100 in the Height % Of Base box.

<P><LI>Choose the OK button.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: You may have to experiment with the value in the Height % Of
Base box to achieve the desired scale.
