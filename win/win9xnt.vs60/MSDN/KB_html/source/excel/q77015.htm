Summary:
<P>
When trying to connect to a SQL server from Microsoft Q+E version 3.0,
you may see the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   DB-Library Network Communication Layer Not Loaded

</PRE>This indicates that your network software does not provide named pipe
support in protected mode.
<P>
More Information:
<P>
Front-end software communicates with a SQL Server by creating a named
pipe. The software that provides this capability at DOS is different
than the software required to create named pipes from Microsoft
Windows running in protected mode.
<P>
There are three Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs) required to create a
named pipe from Windows. DBNMP3.DLL and W3DBLIB.DLL are provided when
you install Q+E. The third file, NETAPI.DLL, is specific to the
network you are using and is provided with your network software.
<P>
<P><h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Verify that you are using LAN Manager 2.0 or later, or network
   software that is compatible to LAN Manager 2.0. You may need to
   consult your network dealer or documentation to determine whether
   it can provide named pipe support in protected mode. Some networks,
   such as Novell, are not shipped with a NETAPI.DLL but you may
   obtain it from a dealer, or through technical support.

<P><LI>Once you verify that your network software provides a NETAPI.DLL,
   verify that it is installed correctly and that the directory it was
   installed into is listed in your PATH= statement.

<P><LI>If you are still having problems, consult your network
   administrator or the technical support service for your network
   software.
