                       Questions and Answers: Macros
               --------------------------------------------

</PRE>Excel for the Macintosh version 4.0 includes the "Microsoft Excel
Function Reference," as well as two user's guides. You will find
several chapters in the user's guides on creating Excel macros, while
the "Microsoft Excel Function Reference" contains every Microsoft
Excel function. If you want more information on creating, using, and
writing Excel macros, Microsoft Press has a book titled "The Complete
Guide to Microsoft Excel Macros" by Charles Kyd and Chris Kinata. For
more information on this book, contact a local book retailer, or call
Microsoft Press direct at (800) MS-PRESS.

<PRE>1. Q. How do I move the active cell relative to its current location
      in my worksheet?

   A. To move the active cell relative to its current location, it is
      easiest to use R1C1 notation with a SELECT command.

      To move one column to the right of the current location, use
      the following command:

         =SELECT("RC[1]")

      To move one row down from the current location, use the
      following command:

         =SELECT("R[1]C")

      You can combine these two commands as well. To move three
      columns to the right and up five rows, use the following
      command:

         =SELECT("R[-5]C[3]")

      Using the square brackets tells Excel to move relative to the
      current location. In the first two examples, when there is no
      number following the row or column, Excel will stay in the same
      column or row that the active cell was in.

2. Q. How can I get Excel to repeat the same set of commands in my
      macro?

   A. Excel 4.0 has many ways of creating loops within a macro. The
      two most common methods of creating loops are very similar to
      methods used in programming languages such as Basic and Pascal.

      Method 1
      --------

      The first method is called a FOR-NEXT loop. It is used mainly
      when you know how many times you want to carry out the commands
      within the loop. To create a FOR-NEXT loop, enter the FOR
      formula in one cell, enter all the commands you want to carry
      out below it, and at the bottom of your column of commands,
      enter the NEXT statement. See pages 154-155 of the "Microsoft
      Excel Function Reference" for a full explanation of the FOR-NEXT
      loop, as well as a small example.

      A looping structure related to the FOR-NEXT loop is the FOR.CELL
      loop. This particular form of a FOR-NEXT loop is used when you
      want to carry out your series of commands on each cell in a
      range. See page 155 of the "Microsoft Excel Function Reference"
      for more information.

      Method 2
      --------

      The second method is called a WHILE loop. This function is used
      mainly when you want to carry out a series of commands until
      some condition becomes true or false. To create a WHILE loop,
      enter the While command in one cell, enter the steps of the
      loops below it, and finally, end the loop with a NEXT command.
      See page 455 of the "Microsoft Excel Function Reference" for a
      full explanation of the WHILE command, and a small example.

3. Q. How can I get more information on calling my own routines, which
      I have written in C or Pascal, from Excel?

   A. Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh version 4.0 supports the
      calling of external code resources (referred to as dynamic-link
      libraries in the Windows environment). These code resources can
      be written in C, Pascal, or with any compiler that supports the
      compilation of code resources. Some of the packages on the
      Macintosh that currently support this include: Think C and Think
      Pascal, both from Symantec Corporation, as well as Macintosh
      Programmer's Workshop (MPW) C, MPW Pascal, and MPW Assembler,
      from Apple Corporation.

      For information on using code resources and developing your own,
      see the Appendix in the "Microsoft Excel Function Reference" or
      call the Microsoft Developer Services Team and obtain a copy of
      the Microsoft Excel 4.0 Software Development Kit. You can reach
      the Developer Services Team by calling (800) 227-4679.
