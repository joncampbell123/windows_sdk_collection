<PRE>                 Microsoft Excel for Windows, Version 4.0
               Automated Product Support Service Fax-Script
                   Questions and Answers: Chart Features
               --------------------------------------------

1. Q. What are the new chart types available in Microsoft Excel version
      4.0?

   A. Microsoft Excel version 4.0 includes many new charting features.
      Among these are three new chart types and 22 new built-in charts.
      The three new chart types are: 3-D bar, 3-D surface, and radar
      charts. The 3-D bar charts are 3-D versions of the current 2-D
      bar charts. The 3-D surface charts help show relationships between
      two sets of data, while the radar charts can help show relationships
      between individual pieces of data.

      Many of the charts found in Excel version 3.0 have been given new
      built-in formats. For example, Microsoft Excel 3.0 has line charts
      that will plot Hi-Lo-Close information. Microsoft Excel 4.0 takes
      this one step further by offering a Volume/Hi-Lo-Close chart type.
      Excel 4.0 also offers extensions to the bar, column, combinations,
      pie, and 3-D pie charts.

2. Q. How do I begin using the Excel 4.0 ChartWizard to help me create my
      chart?

   A. Microsoft Excel 4.0 includes a new feature called the ChartWizard.
      This tool helps you to easily create and modify charts. The
      ChartWizard tool is located on the standard tool bar and is the
      second button from the right. It looks like a miniature chart with
      a magician's wand above it.

      To use the ChartWizard to create a chart, follow these four steps:

      a. Select the range of data that you want to chart.

      b. Click the ChartWizard button. Your mouse cursor will change to a
         cross hair.

      c. Using the mouse, move the cursor to where you want the
         upper-left corner of the chart to be, then press and hold down the
         left mouse button as you drag to where you want the lower-right
         corner of the chart. Release the mouse button.

         Excel 4.0 will display a dialog box titled "ChartWizard-Step
         1 of 5" verifying the range of cells you want to plot. By
         default, Excel will display the range of cells that was
         highlighted before you clicked the ChartWizard tool.

      d. From here on, follow the directions in each dialog box, clicking
         the button marked Next when you have made your choices. If you
         need help on a particular option, click the Help button, and
         Microsoft Excel 4.0 will display the appropriate Help topic.

      Once you have completed all five steps of the ChartWizard,
      Microsoft Excel 4.0 will create the chart with the options you have
      selected.

      If the chart's axes need to be switched or modified, or if you want
      to change the range of cells that Microsoft Excel 4.0 is plotting,
      select the chart by clicking it once, and then click the
      ChartWizard tool in the tool bar. Excel 4.0 will then display two
      screens that will allow you to change these options.

      For more information on creating a chart with Excel 4.0's new
      ChartWizard, see Book 1, Chapter 12 of the "Microsoft Excel User's
      Guide."

3. Q. I have already created a chart and would like to add new
      information to it. How can I do this without re-creating the chart?

   A. Microsoft Excel version 4.0's new ChartWizard is the easiest method
      to modify the range of cells plotted on a chart.

      To change the range of cell's that your chart is plotting, follow
      these four steps:

      a. If you are working with an embedded chart on the worksheet,
         click the chart once to select it. If you are attempting to update
         a chart that has been created as a separate document from the
         worksheet, activate the chart by selecting its name from the
         Window menu.

      b. Click the ChartWizard tool. Excel will display a dialog box
         asking for the range of information you want to plot.

      c. Click and drag the worksheet behind the dialog box to select the
         entire range of data you want to have charted. The range you
         select will generally include the old information as well as the
         new, although there is no requirement to do this. You may select
         any information you want.

      d. When you have selected the range, click the button labeled Next.
         You may now change information on which cells represent your
         category X-axis information and which cells represent your
         value Y-axis information. After making your choices, click the
         button labeled OK, and Excel will modify your chart according to
         your new specifications.

      If you do not want to use the ChartWizard, you may modify the chart
      manually by choosing the Edit Series command from the Chart menu.
      For embedded charts, you must first double-click the chart to open
      it into its own window before you will see the Chart menu. For more
      information on this method of modifying charts, see Book 1, Chapter
      13 of the "Microsoft Excel User's Guide."

      For more information on editing charts in general, see Book 1,
      Chapter 13 of the "Microsoft Excel User's Guide."

4. Q. Whenever I select my data and create a new chart, Excel puts the
      information I want on the X-axis on the Y-axis. How can I change
      this?

   A. Using Microsoft Excel version 4.0's new ChartWizard is the easiest
      method to modify the information that Excel places in the chart.

      To switch your X and Y axes, follow these four steps:

      a. If you are working with an embedded chart on the worksheet,
         click the chart once to select it. If you have created a chart
         as a separate document, activate it by selecting it from the
         Window menu.

      b. Click the ChartWizard tool.

      c. In the dialog box asking for the range of cells to be plotted,
         click the Next button.

      d. In the new dialog box, change the option titled "Data Series In"
         to the opposite of whatever it is currently set to, and click
         the OK button.

      For more information on how Excel plots charts, see Book 1, Chapter
      12, page 23 of the "Microsoft Excel User's Guide."
