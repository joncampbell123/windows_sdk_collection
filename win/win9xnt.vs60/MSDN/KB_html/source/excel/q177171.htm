The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL>

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition, the cell outline (the thick border
that indicates the current selection) may be difficult to see, or it may
disappear completely.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>You have applied a background to the worksheet by pointing to Sheet on
   the Format menu and clicking Background.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>The background image is mostly opaque or does not contain significant
   areas that are the same color as the background color of the cells in
   the worksheet.
<P>
</UL>NOTE: This problem does not occur in Microsoft Excel for Windows 95,
version 7.0, or in Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
If this problem occurs, you can still identify the current selection by
using the following visual cues:

<UL><LI>The name box, which is to the left of the formula bar, contains the
   address of the active cell (for example, B5) or the defined name that
   refers to the active cell.

<LI>The row and column headers for the selected cells appear in a
   bold font style with a three-dimensional appearance.
<P>
   For example, if the headers for rows 4 through 7 and the headers for
   columns C through E are bold, you can determine that the current
   selection is the range C4:E7.
<P>
</UL>You can also remove the background from the worksheet by pointing to Sheet
on the Format menu and clicking Delete Background.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
