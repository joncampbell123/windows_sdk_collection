The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 2.x, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
To export Microsoft Excel graphics in the HPGL (Hewlett-Packard Graphics
Language) format, print the graphic to a file using the HP Plotter driver.
The file can be read directly by another application such as Ventura
Publisher, WordPerfect, Word, PageMaker, and so on.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To export a Microsoft Excel graphic in the HPGL format, you must first have
a driver installed that supports an HP plotter and configure it to print
directly to a file instead of your normal printer port. To accomplish this,
use the appropriate procedure below.
<P>
<P><h3>If You Are Running Microsoft Excel Under Windows 95</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Click the Start button, and then click Settings.

<P><LI>Click the Control Panel icon.

<P><LI>In the Control Panel window, click Printers.

<P><LI>Click the Add Printer icon, and follow the steps in the Add Printer
   Wizard to install and configure the HP ColorPro plotter driver to print
   to a file.
<P>
</OL><h3>If You Are Running Microsoft Excel Under Windows 3.0 or 3.1</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start Windows Control Panel.

<P><LI>Double-click the Printers icon.

<P><LI>Select Add Printer, choose the HP ColorPro plotter from the list
   of printers, and select Install.

<P><LI>Select Configure. From the list of ports, choose FILE: and
   choose OK.

<P><LI>Select Active and choose OK.

<P><LI>Close the Control Panel Window.
<P>
</OL>If You Are Running Microsoft Excel Under
<P><h3>an Earlier or Run-Time Version of Windows</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Open the WIN.INI file (located in the \WINDOWS directory) into a
   text editor such as Notepad.

<P><LI>Find the section labeled "[Ports]" in this file. Add a line under
   this section that reads
<P>
<P><PRE>      OUTPUT.HGL=
</PRE>
<P><LI>Save this file, exit, and restart Windows.

<P><LI>Run the Windows Control Panel. From the Installation menu, Add New
   Printer, and install for an HP plotter.

<P><LI>From the Setup menu, choose Connections. In the list of printers,
   select the plotter. In the list of ports, select OUTPUT.HGL.

<P><LI>Exit Control Panel.
<P>
</OL>Now when you want to create an HPGL file in Microsoft Excel, choose Printer
Setup from the File menu, choose the HP Plotter and select OK. If you
choose Print from the File menu, Excel will first respond with the normal
printing dialog boxes, followed by a prompt for a filename if running under
Windows 3.0 or 3.1. Respond with a filename that has an .HGL extension. If
you are not running under Windows 3.0 or 3.1, Microsoft Excel will print to
the file called OUTPUT.HGL that you added to your WIN.INI file.
<P>
Note: Because Windows versions prior to 3.0 will always plot to the same
file, OUTPUT.HGL in this case, be sure to copy this file under another name
before plotting to it again or you will lose your previous data.
<P>
These .HGL files can then be imported into Word for Windows using the
Insert Picture command, or into PowerPoint using the File Paste From
command. These graphics can then be scaled and cropped normally in both
applications.
<P>
When preparing to create HPGL files for importing into other applications,
keep the following items in mind:

<OL><P><LI>The output from Excel depends heavily on which plotter you have
   configured for under Printer Setup. You may want to experiment with
   selecting different plotters to see how it affects your imported
   graphics.

<P><LI>Related to the type of plotter selected is the type of fonts you
   are using. For consistent results, format text using a printer font.
