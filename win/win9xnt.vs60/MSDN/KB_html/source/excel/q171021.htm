<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 97, when you attempt to switch to another worksheet, the
computer beeps, and the other worksheet does not become the active
worksheet.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when you click a tool on the Control Toolbox toolbar,
and then attempt to switch to another worksheet before you insert the
selected control in the active worksheet.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To insert an ActiveX control into a worksheet other than the active
worksheet, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>In the Control Toolbox, click the tool for the type of control that you
   want to insert.

<P><LI>Right-click the tab scrolling buttons, which are located to the left of
   the sheet tabs near the bottom of the window of the active workbook.

<P><LI>On the shortcut menu, click the name of the worksheet in which you want
   to insert the control.

<P><LI>Draw the control in the worksheet by clicking the worksheet, and then
   dragging the crosshair pointer.
<P>
</OL>If you do not want to use this method, press ESC to cancel the insertion of
the control. After you do this, switch to another worksheet and use the
Control Toolbox to insert controls.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 97, if you click a tool on the Drawing toolbar, you can
insert the drawing object in a worksheet other than the active worksheet by
clicking the sheet tab for the worksheet and then drawing the object.
<P>
However, this behavior does not apply to inserting ActiveX controls. Unless
you use the workaround in this article, you cannot switch to another
worksheet when you before you insert the selected control.
