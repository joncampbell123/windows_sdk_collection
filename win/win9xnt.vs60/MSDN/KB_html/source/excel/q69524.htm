Summary:
<P>
The error message "More than one field has this name: {field_name}"
(where {field name} is the name of your field) can appear when you try
to save a set of mailing labels in Q+E.
<P>
This indicates that two fields from a query have the same name. To
correct this, choose SQL Query from the Select menu and modify the
query to include only one set of common names.
<P>
More Information:
<P>
The mailing label option under Save As... does not have the capacity
to distinguish between two fields with the same name, even if the
filename identifier is attached to the beginning of the field.
<P>
In most cases, the message indicates that two databases have been
joined and one of the fields to be printed was in both databases. When
a "join" is performed, Q+E includes all fields by default. The query
window keeps the duplicate fields separate by attaching the database
filename to the beginning of the field. By modifying the SQL Query,
you can remove one of the fields from the query.
<P>
<P><h3>Example</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   SELECT EMP.FIRST_NAME, EMP.LAST_NAME, EMP.EMP_ID, HIRE_DATE,
   SALARY, DEPT, EXEMPT, INTERESTS, ADDR.FIRST_NAME, ADDR.EMP_ID,
   STREET, CITY, STATE, ZIP
   FROM C:\EXCEL300\QE\EMP.DBF, C:\EXCEL300\QE\ADDR.DBF
   WHERE EMP.LAST_NAME = ADDR.LAST_NAME

</PRE>This is an example of a join, using the sample files EMP.DBF and
ADDR.DBF, where the LAST_NAME fields are identical. Notice that there
are three fields that have the same name. Because the join was being
performed using the LAST_NAME field, Q+E was able to leave the
ADDR.LAST_NAME field out. However the FIRST_NAME and EMP_ID fields are
duplicated in the query. If either of these fields are used in saving
mail labels, it will generate the error message.
<P>
To correct this query, remove the ADDR.FIRST_NAME and ADDR.EMP_ID.
<P>
Note:  This problem still occurs in Excel for OS/2 version 3.0.
