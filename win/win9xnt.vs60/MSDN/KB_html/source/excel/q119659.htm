The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, version 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel version 5.0, when you create a chart that contains a
complex reference, and you save the file that contains the chart as
a Microsoft Excel version 4.0 file (either chart, worksheet or
workbook), if you save the file in Microsoft Excel version 4.0, you
receive the following error message when you open the file again in
Microsoft Excel version 4.0:
<P>
<PRE>   External References are not valid

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior only occurs after you save the file in Microsoft Excel
version 4.0, and then open the file again in Microsoft Excel version
4.0. You do not receive an error message when you open the file in
Microsoft Excel version 5.0 after saving the file in either version.
<P>
This behavior occurs when you create a chart using complex
references, by selecting nonadjacent cells, such as A1, D1, A3, D3,
and so on. When you open the chart in Microsoft Excel version 4.0,
the chart references are incorrect, although the data on the chart appears
correct. No error message appears when you open the chart, however,
if you save the chart in version 4.0, and then open the chart again,
you receive the above error message.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
To avoid receiving this error message when you open a chart in
Microsoft Excel version 4.0, do either of the following:

<UL><LI>If you have Microsoft Excel version 5.0, as well as version 4.0, save
   the chart in version 5.0 only (to the 4.0 file format). Note that you
   can still view the file in version 4.0.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>If you only have version 4.0 of Microsoft Excel, you can correct the
   chart references by using the formula bar. Note however that if you save
   the file again in Microsoft Excel version 5.0, the problem still occurs.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in a
later version of Microsoft Excel.
