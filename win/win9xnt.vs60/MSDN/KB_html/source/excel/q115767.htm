<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, when you use the Advanced Filter to filter a list on a
worksheet, and the criteria range is located on another worksheet, the
Criteria Range box is empty when you use the Advanced Filter again on the
worksheet that contains the list. Additionally, the List Range box is empty
when you use the Advanced Filter again on the worksheet that contains the
criteria range.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs because the criteria range that you use to filter your
list is defined on the worksheet that it is contained in. Similarly, the
list range only appears in the Advanced Filter dialog box if it is
contained on the current sheet.
<P>
If you use a criteria range that is contained on the same worksheet as the
list, and you select a cell in the list before you use the Advanced Filter,
both the list range and the criteria range are displayed in the Advanced
Filter dialog box.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
To automatically display the criteria range in the Advanced Filter
dialog box, when the criteria range is contained on a different
worksheet but in the same workbook as your list, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Select the worksheet that contains the criteria range.

<P><LI>On the Insert menu, click Name, and then click Define.

<P><LI>If you have previously used this range as a criteria range, delete
   the local name "SheetName!criteria."

<P><LI>In the Names In Workbook box, type "Criteria" (without the quotation
   marks). Click the Refers To Box, and select the criteria range on
   the worksheet. Click OK.
<P>
</OL>To automatically display the list range in the Advanced Filter dialog
box, even when the selected cell is not contained in the list, follow these 
steps:

<OL><P><LI>Select the list range.

<P><LI>On the Insert menu, click Name, and then click Define. In the
   Names In Workbook box, type "Database" (without the quotation marks)
   and click OK.
<P>
</OL>Note that the list range is only displayed in the Advanced Filter
dialog box if the worksheet that contains the list is active when you
use the Advanced filter.
<P>
If the list range and the criteria range are contained in different
workbooks, you must enter the missing criteria range or list range by
typing the range, or by clicking in the range box, and selecting the
worksheet that contains the respective range.
<P>
