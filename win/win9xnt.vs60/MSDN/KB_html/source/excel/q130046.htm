The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, if you receive the Conflict Resolution dialog box when
you save a shared workbook, when you click the "Use All Remaining Changes
From My Session" button or the "Use All Remaining Changes From The Other
Session" button, the mouse pointer changes to the hourglass, and Microsoft
Excel may appear to hang.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior may occur when the changes you made to the shared file
conflict with the changes saved in the same file by another user. The
Conflict Resolution dialog box appears in this case, asking how you want to
resolve the conflicts. If you click the "Use All Remaining Changes From My
Session" button or the "Use All Remaining Changes From The Other Session"
button, the conflicts are resolved without prompting you for each
conflicting cell.
<P>
If there are many changes to resolve, this process can take a long time, a
matter of minutes. If you choose one of the "Use All Remaining Changes"
buttons, there is no indication that Microsoft Excel is processing any
changes while the conflicts are being resolved. There is no dialog box or
status bar to indicate the percentage of the process that is complete; and
the Microsoft Excel window is not updated (no screen updates) as the
conflicts are being resolved. Additionally, if you press CTRL+ALT+DELETE to
display the Close Program dialog box, the text (Not responding) appears
following the Microsoft Excel item in the list of programs.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this behavior, switch to another application in Windows
while Microsoft Excel resolves the conflicts in the workbook. Windows 95
allows you to work in an application while another application is
processing in the background.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
