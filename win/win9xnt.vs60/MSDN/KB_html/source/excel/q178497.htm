The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The Query Wizard may not appear when you edit an existing query. Instead,
the query appears in Microsoft Query.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs if the query does not use a certain format, even if you
originally created the query by using the Query Wizard. When you edit an
existing query, the Query Wizard is designed to display queries that use
either of the following two formats:
<P>
<PRE>   (test = a) OR (test = b) OR (test = c)

   (test1 = a) AND (test2 = b) AND (test3 = c)

</PRE>The expression must be a series of clauses that are in a single column
connected with the OR operator, or a series of clauses that are in multiple
columns connected with the AND operator. That is, the expression must be
represented in the Criteria pane as a single row or single column.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
If the query does not meet either of the formats in the "Cause" section of
this article, you cannot edit the query by using the Query Wizard. You must
modify the query in the Criteria pane in Microsoft Query.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design of the Query Wizard.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Query, there are several options for retrieving external data.
To take advantage of these options and ensure that you get the results you
are looking for, keep the following guidelines in mind:

<UL><LI>Use the Query Wizard when you want to create a simple query. With the
   Query Wizard, you can select the tables and fields you want to include,
   and an inner join is automatically created when the Query Wizard
   recognizes a primary key field in one table and a field with the same
   name in the other table. The Query Wizard also allows you to sort the
   external data range and do simple filtering before you return data to
   Microsoft Excel. When you create a query in the Query Wizard, you can
   also change it in the Query Wizard. After you create the query, you can
   run it in Microsoft Excel or in Microsoft Query.

<LI>Create a query in Microsoft Query when you want to create a more
   complex query. This method gives you the most control because you can
   narrow down the result set by creating an inner join or an outer join or
   by using criteria and expressions. Expressions are calculations you can
   make by using operators, functions, field names, and constants. You can
   perform more complex filtering by using criteria. You can view the
   result set in Microsoft Query. When you are sure the result set contains
   the data you want, you can return it to Microsoft Excel. After you
   create the query, you can run it in Microsoft Excel or Microsoft Query.
