The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 2.x, 3.0, 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, versions 1.x, 2.2, 3.0, 4.0
</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Precision As Displayed command in Microsoft Excel rounds any value
that has been formatted to contain a fixed number of decimal places.
The values, which are stored internally, then match those showing on
the screen, and all worksheet calculations use the rounded values.
Values formatted as General are not effected.
<P>
Once this command has been put into effect, the original values, which
may previously have contained more decimal places, are no longer
available.
<P>
NOTE: This information is true only for entered values; values that
are returned as a result of formulas can be returned to their full
precision. In Excel 1.5 and earlier, you can restore full precision to
values returned by formulas by choosing Full Precision from the
Options menu. In Excel 2.0 or later, choose Calculation from the
Options menu and deselect Precision As Displayed.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In Excel 2.0 or later, Precision As Displayed is applied only to the
document for which it is chosen and the option is saved with the
worksheet.
<P>
In Excel 1.5 and earlier, while the Precision As Displayed command is
in force, it is applied to any worksheet that is open or activated
during a session, but is not saved with the worksheet.
