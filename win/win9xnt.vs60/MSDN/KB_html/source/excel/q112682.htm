The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, version 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you set up Microsoft Excel version 5.0 for Windows, you may
receive the error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Application Error
   Call to Undefined Dynalink

</PRE>If you receive this error message, the Setup program will terminate
after you choose the Close button.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This error may be caused by if you have an early version of the CTL3D.DLL
file on your computer.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, do either of the following:

<UL><LI>Do the following to rename or remove all versions of CTL3D.DLL from your
   system:
<P>
   a. Use File Manager to search for all instances of CTL3D.DLL on your
<P><PRE>      hard disk.
</PRE><P>
   b. Delete or rename earlier versions of the file.
<P>
   c. Restart Microsoft Windows, and attempt the installation again.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>If you restart Microsoft Windows, you may be able to run Microsoft Excel
   Setup even if an earlier version of CTL3D.DLL exists on your computer
   (as long as you do not run any other programs before starting Microsoft
   Excel Setup). However, this workaround is not as certain to work as the
   first workaround.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Setup program included with Microsoft Excel uses the CTL3D.DLL dynamic
link library when displaying certain dialog boxes. If the CTL3D.DLL file is
not located on your computer, Microsoft Excel Setup will install a version
of the file on your hard drive.
<P>
If an earlier version of CTL3D.DLL is already present on your hard drive
and is being used by another program that is running or that was run
earlier in this Windows session, the old CTL3D.DLL file may not be
compatible with Microsoft Excel Setup. If this is the case, the
"Application Error -- Call to Undefined Dynalink" error message will appear
and the Setup program will be terminated.
