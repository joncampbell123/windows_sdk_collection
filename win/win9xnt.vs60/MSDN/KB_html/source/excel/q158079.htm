<P>
The Internet Assistant Wizard is not new to Microsoft Excel, but it has
changed significantly since it was released as a free add-in available on
the Microsoft World Wide Web site in January 1996. The Internet Assistant
Wizard is now an installable component of Microsoft Office and/or Microsoft
Excel and has been enhanced to take advantage of the new Internet features
of Microsoft Office, Microsoft FrontPage and Microsoft Internet Explorer.

With the Internet Assistant Wizard, you can leverage existing Microsoft
Excel spreadsheet data to create and distribute documents that can be
viewed online with popular browsers. By clicking a series of buttons in the
wizard, you can convert spreadsheet data to HTML format either as a
separate Web document or into an existing Web document.
<P>

installed. To install the Internet Assistant Wizard, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Close all Microsoft Office programs.

<P><LI>Run the Microsoft Office Setup program.

<P><LI>In the dialog box that displays the "Add/Remove", "Reinstall", and
   "Remove All" buttons, click "Add/Remove."

<P><LI>In the Maintenance dialog box, select the "Web Page Authoring (HTML)"
   check box and then click Continue.
<P>
</OL>This selection installs all of the Microsoft Office components that you
need to create Internet and intranet web documents and forms.

<OL><P><LI>After the Office Setup program completes, start Microsoft Excel.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: The "Web Page Authoring (HTML)" component of Microsoft Office is not

program.

Wizard - Step 1 of 4" dialog box appears.
<P>
<P><h3>Using the Internet Assistant Wizard</h3>

Specify which ranges and charts in your workbook you want to include in
your HTML document. You can also rearrange these items to specify the order

<P>
If you want to include a range of cells that do not appear in the "Ranges
and charts to convert:" list box, click Add, select the desired range, and
then click OK in the dialog box that contains the range reference you just
selected.
<P>
<P><h3>Step 2</h3>
 
Specify whether you want to create an independent, ready-to-use HTML
document or if you want to insert your workbook data and charts into an
existing HTML document.
<P>
<P><h3>Step 3</h3>
 
If you chose to create a new HTML document, Step 3 of the wizard provides
the following optional items that you can include in your HTML document:

<P>
<PRE>   &lt;!--##Table##--&gt;

the file) and whether or not you want to open the document directly or to
open it from your FrontPage Web.

the option to open it from a FrontPage Web.
<P>
<P><h3>Step 4</h3>

file or as a file in your FrontPage Web. In this step, you also specify the
path to the file.
