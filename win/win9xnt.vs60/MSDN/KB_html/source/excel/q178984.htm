<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition, if you remove one or more page
breaks from a worksheet when multiple worksheets are selected (that is, you
are in group edit mode), the page breaks may not be removed from all of the
worksheets. Specifically, the page breaks may not be removed from the last
or next-to-last selected worksheet.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft provides programming examples for illustration only, without
warranty either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the
implied warranties of merchantability and/or fitness for a particular
purpose. This article assumes that you are familiar with the programming
language being demonstrated and the tools used to create and debug
procedures. Microsoft support engineers can help explain the functionality
of a particular procedure, but they will not modify these examples to
provide added functionality or construct procedures to meet your specific
needs. If you have limited programming experience, you may want to contact
the Microsoft fee-based consulting line at (800) 936-5200. For more
information about the support options available from Microsoft, please see
the following page on the World Wide Web:
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/support/supportnet/refguide/default.asp">http://www.microsoft.com/support/supportnet/refguide/default.asp</A></B>

</PRE>If you manually remove page breaks from a worksheet while multiple
worksheets are selected, make sure that you also switch to the last and
next-to-last selected worksheets and remove the page breaks from these
sheets.
<P>
If you are using a Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications macro or
procedure to remove page breaks while multiple worksheets are selected,
make sure that all of the page breaks are correctly removed by including
code similar to the following:
<P>
<PRE>   ' Store the cell from which to remove page breaks.
   xCell = ActiveCell.Address

   ' For each worksheet that is currently selected...
   For Each xSheet In ActiveWindow.SelectedSheets

       ' Remove the page breaks from the active cell in that worksheet.
       xSheet.Range(xCell).PageBreak = xlPageBreakNone

   ' Repeat for all selected worksheets.
   Next xSheet

</PRE>In this example, xCell is the cell that is immediately below and/or to the
right of a page break. When you run a macro or procedure that includes this
code, it removes the page breaks from the active cell in each of the
selected worksheets.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition, you can manually remove a page
break from a cell by selecting the cell, and then clicking Remove Page
Break on the Insert menu. You can insert a page break by selecting the cell
and clicking Page Break on the Insert menu.
