The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel version 7.0, if you open and save a file that you
created in Microsoft Excel version 5.0, the file size increases by 4-6K.
This behavior occurs even though Microsoft Excel version 7.0 uses the same
file format as Microsoft Excel version 5.0.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs in part because of an optimization in Microsoft  Excel
version 7.0 that allows Microsoft Excel to save files faster than version
5.0. Note that when you create and save a file in Microsoft Excel version
7.0, the file is not necessarily larger than the equivalent file that you
create and save in Microsoft Excel version 5.0. However, when you create a
file in Microsoft Excel version 5.0, and then open and save the file in
Microsoft Excel version 7.0, the file size increases by approximately 3K.
<P>
Note that in Microsoft Excel version 7.0, when you open a file that you
created and saved in Microsoft Excel version 5.0 without summary
information, the file size may increase by approximately 5-9K. The greater
the size of your Microsoft Excel version 5.0 file, the smaller the amount
that the file size increases when you open and save the file in Microsoft
Excel version 7.0. For example, a Microsoft Excel version 5.0 workbook that
contains 16 worksheets does not increase in file size as much as a version
5.0 workbook that contains 1 worksheet when you save the file in Microsoft
Excel version 7.0.
