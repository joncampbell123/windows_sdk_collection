The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 4.0, 4.0a, 5.0, 5.0c
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you define a large number of names (over 6,000) on a worksheet or
macro sheet, you may receive one of the following errors when you
choose Define Name from the Formula menu:

<UL><LI>The Define Name dialog box does not appear and you receive the "Not
   enough memory" error message.
<P>
  -or-

<LI>The Define Name dialog box is displayed for a fraction of a second
   and then disappears. At the same moment, you are switched to
   another open application, just as if you had pressed the ALT+TAB
   key combination.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This error occurs because of a limitation in the Standard Dialog
Manager (SDM), which manages memory allocation for dialog boxes in
Microsoft Excel. If the number of names on your worksheet is too
great, the SDM runs out of memory when it tries to populate the "Names
in Sheet" list box.
<P>
The number of defined names that you can have before the error begins
to occur varies, but is usually between 6300 and 6800 names, depending
on the complexity of the names that you have defined.
<P>
Note that the DEFINE.NAME() and DELETE.NAME() macro commands are not
influenced by the amount of available memory in the SDM.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To avoid this problem, delete enough names so that the SDM can handle
the remaining names. Because the Define Name dialog box is
unavailable, you can delete names in two ways:

<UL><LI>Write a macro that uses the DELETE.NAME() command to eliminate
   names.
<P>
  -or-

<LI>Copy the entire contents of the worksheet to a new worksheet. On
   the new worksheet, redefine only the names you need.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This error only occurs in Microsoft Excel for Windows. Please comment
this article if this behavior is seen to occur on other platforms.
