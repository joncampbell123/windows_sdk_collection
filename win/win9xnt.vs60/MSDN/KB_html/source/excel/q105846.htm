The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0c
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, versions 7.0, 7.0a
<LI>Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, versions 5.0, 5.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In the versions of Microsoft Excel listed above, when you use the 
PivotTable Wizard, you may not be able to add fields below the last field 
in the row, column, or data area. When this occurs, the added field pushes 
the last displayed field out of view. Because of this, the order in which 
you add fields to the table in the PivotTable Wizard is not reflected in 
the resulting pivot table.
<P>
Additionally, you may not be able to edit all of your row, column, or data
fields in the PivotTable Wizard.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The PivotTable Wizard in Microsoft Excel 5.x and 7.x can only display up to 
12 row fields, 9 column fields, and 5 data fields; although you can add 
more fields to the PivotTable with the PivotTable Wizard, you cannot add 
them to the bottom of the list of fields once the list reaches these 
limits. You can only add fields above the last field displayed. When you do 
this, the last field is pushed out of view.
<P>
After you add the limit of fields that can be displayed in the PivotTable
Wizard, additional fields that you add are added in the wrong order. For
example, if you add seven fields to the Data area in the PivotTable Wizard,
the first four fields are displayed in the order in which you added them,
but the last three fields are added in the opposite order in which you
added them, and display in this incorrect order in the resulting pivot
table.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Adding Fields in the Correct Order</h3>
 
<P>
To add a number of fields in the PivotTable Wizard so that they appear in
the order in which they are listed on the worksheet, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Add the first 4 data fields in the order in which you want them to
   appear in the pivot table.

<P><LI>Add additional fields in the reverse of the order in which you want them
   to appear.
<P>
</OL>Note that for row fields, add the first 11 row fields in the correct order;
the remaining row fields in reverse order. For Column fields, add the first
8 column fields in the correct order; the remaining column fields in
reverse order.
<P>
Note that you can also change the order of the fields after you create the
PivotTable by dragging the fields to the new location.
<P>
<P><h3>Editing and Moving Data Fields</h3>
 
<P>
To edit data fields not visible in the PivotTable Wizard, select the
desired data field in the pivot table and choose PivotTable Field from the
Data menu or a shortcut menu. To access the shortcut menu for a data field,
select one of the data fields in the PivotTable and click the right mouse
button.
<P>
To move data fields not visible in the PivotTable Wizard, select the cell
containing the data field to move, and drag the data to the desired
location in the PivotTable.
<P>
<P><h3>Editing and Moving Row and Column Fields</h3>
 
<P>
To edit row or column fields not visible in the PivotTable Wizard, double-
click the desired field button in the pivot table or select the desired
field button and choose PivotTable Field from the Data menu.
<P>
To move row or column fields not visible in the PivotTable Wizard, drag the
field button to the desired location in the pivot table.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This is a known problem in the versions of Microsoft Excel listed at the 
beginning of this article. In Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows and Microsoft 
Excel 98 Macintosh Edition, these limitations do not apply; these versions 
of Microsoft Excel have been redesigned to allow more row, column, page, 
and data fields.
