<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In a Microsoft Excel workbook, if you create a local name on one
worksheet, and you use the name without the sheet name on another
worksheet, the value that the name refers to is used when you save,
close, and open the file again.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When you use a local name on a worksheet other than the worksheet on
which the name is defined, the #NAME? error value is returned if you
do not precede the defined name with the sheet name. This behavior is
by design because the name is local, or only defined on the sheet on
which it was created.
<P>
However, if you use a local name on a worksheet other than the
worksheet on which the name is defined, without the sheet name, and
you save and close the file, the value of the name is returned when
you open the file again. The local name behaves like a global name, that
is, a value is returned even though the name is not defined on
the current worksheet.
<P>
Note that if you enter the name again, the #NAME? error value is
returned as expected. This behavior occurs only when you open the
file again after saving it.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in
Microsoft Excel version 5.0c.
