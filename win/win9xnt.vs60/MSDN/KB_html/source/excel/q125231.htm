This article contains the topic numbers and descriptions for the topics
available in the MAINXL.HLP file. Topics 438-585 for Microsoft Excel 5.0
are different from those for 5.0c; therefore, these topics are listed under

   TITLE     : "XL5: List of Help Topics in MAINXL.HLP File (Part 1 of 2)"

</PRE>Note that topics 1-437 apply to Microsoft Excel version 5.0 AND Microsoft
Excel version 5.0c.
<P>
<P><h3>Using a Help Topic</h3>
 
<P>
You can use these topics in conjunction with dialog boxes that are equipped
with Help buttons; you can call them with the HELP() function in Microsoft
Excel 4.0; or, you can call them with the Application.Help line in a Visual
Basic, Applications Edition, macro. The following are examples of both
types of macros.
<P>
<PRE>   Visual Basic code:

      Application.Help "MAINXL.HLP", 3

   Microsoft Excel 4.0 macro:

      =HELP("MAINXL.HLP!3")

</PRE><h3>Finding a Help Topic ID</h3>
 
<P>
To find the help topic ID numbers for a help file in Microsoft Excel, use
the following macro:
<P>
HELP_TOPICS
=FOR("Message",1,395)
=HELP("Mainxl.hlp!"&amp;Message)
=SEND.KEYS("%EC+{END}+{DOWN}%C")
=FORMULA(Message,OFFSET(!A1,Message,0))
=PASTE(OFFSET(B1,Message,0))
=NEXT()
