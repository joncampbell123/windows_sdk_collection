The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, version 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In order to run Microsoft Excel version 5.0 for Windows, you must have the
Share program loaded on your computer. If you try to run Microsoft Excel
when Share is not loaded, you will receive one of the following error
messages:
<P>
<PRE>   You must exit Windows and load SHARE.EXE in order to run Microsoft
   Excel.

   -or-

   Cannot open or save any more documents

</PRE><h3>To Correct This Problem</h3>
 
<P>
If you receive this error message, you can do one of the following:

<UL><LI>Add the following line to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file
<P>
<P><PRE>      &lt;path&gt;\share.exe /l:500 /f:5100
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;path&gt; is the drive and directory where the SHARE.EXE file is
   located (usually the MS-DOS directory). For example, if your MS-DOS
   directory is called DOS and is on drive C, add the following line
   to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file:
<P>
<P><PRE>      c:\dos\share.exe /l:500 /f:5100
</PRE><P>
   You may need to add this line if it was removed from your
   AUTOEXEC.BAT file or if the Setup program was unable to add it.
<P>
   NOTE: When troubleshooting this line in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file, double
   check that the letter l is being used instead of the number 1.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>If you are running Microsoft Windows for Workgroups, try running
   Windows in 386 enhanced mode.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>If you load SHARE.EXE into high memory and encounter the error message,
   try loading it into conventional memory.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>If the path designation for the temp directory does not contain a drive
   letter, such as set temp=temp, or if the backslash (\) designator is not
   used in the path, for example, set temp=c:temp.
<P>
   The valid set statement in both these cases should be:
<P>
<P><PRE>      set temp=c:\temp
</PRE><P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Share program provides the range locking functionality to Microsoft
Excel that is required in object linking and embedding (OLE) version 2.0
operations.
<P>
If you are using Microsoft Excel version 5.0 under Windows version
3.1, or under Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 in standard mode, the
MS-DOS Share program must be run before you start Windows. If you are
using Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 or 3.11 in enhanced mode, an
equivalent of the Share program (VSHARE.386: see below) is automatically
loaded for you.
<P>
If the Microsoft Excel Setup program detects that Share (or an equivalent
such as VSHARE.386) is not loaded on your computer, the SHARE command is
added to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.
<P>
You do not need to run the MS-DOS Share program if you run Microsoft
Excel under Windows for Workgroups 3.1 or 3.11 in 386 enhanced mode.
Windows for Workgroups uses a comparable file-sharing utility called
VSHARE.386.
