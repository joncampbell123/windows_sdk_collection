      number <B><A href="../excel/q130490.htm">Q130490</A></B> from the FastTips Catalog. Note that this
      information is also available in the "What's New" book in
      Microsoft Excel online Help.

2. Q. What are the minimum system requirements for running Microsoft
      Excel for Windows 95?

   A. The minimum hardware and software requirements for running
      Microsoft Excel for Windows 95 are the following:

       - A personal computer with a 386DX or higher processor (486
         recommended).

       - Microsoft Windows 95 operating system or Microsoft Windows
         NT(TM) Workstation operating system version 3.51 or later
         (will not run on earlier versions of Windows).

       - 6 megabytes (MB) of memory for use on Windows 95 or 12 MB of
         memory for use on a Windows NT workstation.

       - Hard disk space required: 8 MB for a Compact installation;
         18 MB for a Typical installation; 38 MB (maximum) for a
         Custom installation.

       - One 3.5-inch high-density disk drive.

       - A VGA- or higher-resolution video adapter (SVGA 256-color
         recommended).

       - Microsoft Mouse or compatible pointing device.

      Optional hardware and software items include:

       - Windows-compatible network.

       - Windows-compatible printer.

       - 2400- or higher-baud modem (9600-baud modem recommended).

       - Audio board with headphones or speakers.

3. Q. What new analysis tools does Microsoft Excel for Windows 95
      provide?

   A. In addition to the list management, charting, and PivotTable(R)
      analysis tools currently found in Microsoft Excel, we have
      provided additional tools and enhanced the most commonly used
      tools. For example, shared lists allow multiple users to add
      and analyze data in the same file at the same time. For instant
      data analysis, AutoCalculate provides a running sum, average,
      or count of currently highlighted cells.

4. Q. Does Microsoft Excel for Windows 95 use multiple threads?

   A. No. After careful evaluation, it was decided that Microsoft
      Excel would not benefit from multi-threading--in fact, we
      determined that this functionality would actually slow down the
      recalculation speed on a single-processor machine.
      Consequently, we focused our development efforts on rewriting
      the recalculation engine. In some cases, this redesigned engine
      results in a 50-percent increase in calculation speed.

5. Q. Will I be able to use my Microsoft Excel version 5.0 Visual
      Basic(R), Applications Edition, modules in Microsoft Excel for
      Windows 95?

   A. Yes. In most cases, you will be able to use your Visual
      Basic modules in Microsoft Excel for Windows 95. However, if
      you create advanced macros that make calls to the Windows API,
      these macros will be affected by the switch to Windows 95. For
      more information about this issue, order item number <B><A href="../vbapps/q131525.htm">Q131525</A></B>
