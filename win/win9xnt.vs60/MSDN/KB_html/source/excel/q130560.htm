<P>
<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, when you use the shared lists feature, by clicking the
Allow Multi-User Editing check box on the Editing tab of the Shared Lists
dialog box, some of the commands and features that you normally use in your
workbook are not available.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs because when you share a workbook file, you cannot
use some of the Microsoft Excel features that you normally use. This
behavior is by design of Microsoft Excel because of the way that a shared
file is saved. For example, you cannot change cell formatting in a shared
workbook.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following information describes the features and commands that are
not available while you are editing a shared workbook.
<P>
<P><h3>Menu Commands</h3>
 
<P>
The following table contains the menu commands that are unavailable
(grayed) in a shared workbook:
<P>
<PRE>   Menu       Command
   ------------------

   File       Properties

   Edit       Delete Sheet
              Links

              Table
              Group And Outline (sub menu items grayed)
              PivotTable

</PRE><h3>Toolbars</h3>
 
<P>
You cannot use any of the buttons on the following toolbars in a shared
workbook:
<P>
<PRE>   Formatting
   Forms
   Drawing
   Chart

</PRE>On the Standard Toolbar, the following buttons are disabled:
<P>
<PRE>   AutoSum
   Function Wizard
   ChartWizard
   Map
   Format Painter

</PRE><h3>Formulas</h3>
 
<P>
When you enter a formula on a worksheet in a shared workbook, you receive
the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   New or copied formulas won't be saved while the file is being shared.
   Show this message in the future?

</PRE><h3>Objects</h3>
 
<P>
You can't select any objects on a worksheet in a shared workbook. This
includes OLE objects, drawing objects and dialog controls.
<P>
<P><h3>Visual Basic Modules</h3>
 
<P>
When you share a workbook that contains a Visual Basic module, you
receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Cannot edit VBA modules in shared mode

</PRE>You can select a Visual Basic module in your shared workbook. However, if
you attempt to edit a procedure in the module, you receive the following
error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Can't edit module

</PRE>Note however that you CAN run a macro on a module sheet in a shared
workbook.
<P>
<P><h3>Record New Macro</h3>
 
<P>
If you record a new macro in a shared workbook, the macro is recorded in
a new workbook. In the Record New Macro dialog box, the "New Workbook"
option under Store In is selected by default. The "This Workbook" option
under Store In is unavailable in a shared workbook.
<P>
<P><h3>Chart Sheet or Dialog Sheet</h3>
 
<P>
Although you can select a chart sheet or dialog sheet in a shared
workbook, you cannot select any of the items on the chart or custom dialog
box.
<P>
<P><h3>Macro Sheet</h3>
 
<P>
You can select a macro sheet in a shared workbook. However, because
commands on a macro sheet generally begin with an equal sign (=) (as when
you enter a formula), you receive the error message listed above in the
Formulas section. Note, however, that you CAN run a macro from a macro
sheet in a shared workbook.
