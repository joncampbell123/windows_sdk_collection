The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, when you close a file after making changes to the file,
and the dialog box appears asking if you want to save changes, the existing
filename is missing from the dialog box. That is, the dialog box contains
the following incomplete text:
<P>
<PRE>   Save changes in

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Normally, when you close a file, if you have made changes to the file since
the last time you saved the file, you receive a dialog box with the
following message
<P>
<PRE>   Save changes in WP1177?

</PRE>where WP1177 is the name of the file you are closing.
<P>
However, if your screen is configured to display fonts with the Large Fonts
setting (Settings tab in Display Properties dialog box), and you have
changed your Windows display appearance to use an "extra large" scheme,
this "save changes" dialog box may appear without the filename text. For
example, if your screen is configured to use the Large Fonts setting, and
you use the Appearance tab in the Display Properties dialog box to select
the Windows Standard (extra large) scheme, this problem occurs in Microsoft
Excel when you close a file that you have modified.
<P>
Note that this behavior is only a display problem. This behavior does not
affect the functionality of saving files in Microsoft Excel.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To correct this behavior so that the filename appears again in the "save
changes" dialog box, close Microsoft Excel and restart your computer.
<P>
Note that although it is necessary to restart your computer after making a
change to the Font Size setting in the Display Properties dialog box, it is
not necessary to restart your computer after changing the display Scheme.
However, the behavior described above may occur in Microsoft Excel if you
do not restart your computer after changing to an "extra large" scheme.
