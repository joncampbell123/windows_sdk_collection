The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Query for Windows, version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Query, when you edit your query and enter the value zero (0)
in a record in your database, you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Division by zero

</PRE>When you click OK, one of the following symptoms may occur:
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Query version 1.0</h3>
 

<UL><LI>The data in your query disappears from the Data pane
<P>
   -or-

<LI>You receive a general protection (GP) fault in module MSQUERY.EXE
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when you enter the value zero in a column in your query
that is being used as the denominator in a division operation in a field
expression. For example, if you create an expression for a field in your
query, such as Field1/Field2, you may receive the results described above
if you then enter the value zero in the Field2 column.
<P>
By design, you receive the "Division by zero" error message whenever you
enter a value or expression in your query that causes the value zero to be
used in the denominator of an expression. However, if you create the
division expression for a field, and you then edit your data so that the
value zero is used as the denominator in the expression, your query data
may disappear from the Data pane following the "Division by zero" error
message.
<P>
Additionally, if you create the division expression for a field from an
existing expression, and you then edit your data so that the value zero is
used as the denominator in the expression, you may receive a GP fault in
addition to the "Division by zero" error message.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To avoid this problem, do not add the value zero to a record in your
database if the column that contains this value is being used as the
denominator in an expression for a field.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
