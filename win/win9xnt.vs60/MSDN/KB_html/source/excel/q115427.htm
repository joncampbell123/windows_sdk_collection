The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Microsoft Excel for Windows, version 5.0
 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel version 5.0, a reference to a cell that contains a
remote link is not updated if the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>The cell that contains the reference refers to a cell on a following
   worksheet in the same workbook.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>The following worksheet is linked to an external workbook.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>The external workbook is not open when you open the linked workbook.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs when you open the linked workbook while the source
workbook is closed. If the cell A1 on Sheet2 in BOOK2.XLS contains an
external link to a value in BOOK1.XLS, and cell A1 on Sheet1 in BOOK2.XLS
contains a link to cell A1 on Sheet1, when you open BOOK2.XLS while
BOOK1.XLS is closed, the value in cell A1 on Sheet1 is not updated.
<P>
The value in cell A1 on Sheet2 in BOOK2.XLS (external link) is updated when
you choose Yes in the dialog box that prompts you to re-establish the
links. However, the value in cell A1 on the previous worksheet, Sheet1 in
BOOK2.XLS, that refers to the cell that contains the external link is not
updated.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
To update a linked cell that refers to a cell on another worksheet
that contains an external link, do either of the following:

<UL><LI>Update the external link by doing the following:
<P>
   1. In the workbook that contains the links, choose Links from the Edit
<P><PRE>      menu.
</PRE><P>
   2. In the Links dialog box, choose the Update Now button.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Open the source workbook either before or after you open the linked
   workbook.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in
Microsoft Excel for Windows version 5.0c.
