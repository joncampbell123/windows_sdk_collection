The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 97, text contained in worksheet cells may print in front
of drawing objects, rather than behind them.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This may occur if you are using a printer driver that does not properly
handle the mix of text and graphics generated by Microsoft Excel 97 when
you print a worksheet.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
There are two possible solutions to this problem:

<UL><LI>Turn on the "Print TrueType as graphics" option for your printer. To
   do this:
<P>
<P><PRE>    1. On the Start menu, point to Settings, and then click Printers.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    2. Secondary-click the printer whose settings you want to change. On
       the shortcut menu, click Properties.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    3. Click the Fonts tab.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    4. Select the "Print TrueType as graphics" option button.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    5. Click OK.
</PRE><P>
   Once this setting is enabled, text contained in cells should print
   correctly behind drawing objects, not in front of them.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE>
<LI>Obtain a newer printer driver for your printer. If your printer
   manufacturer has a home page on the Internet, you may be able to
   obtain a driver by visiting their home page. Web addresses for
   some popular printer manufacturers are included here:

   NOTE: These addresses are current as of 10/1/96 and may change at
   any time.

   Some drivers are also available from the Microsoft Software Download
   Library (MSDL). To connect to MSDL, dial (425) 936-6735 with your
   modem set to 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, and no parity (8N1).

</PRE></UL>For additional information about downloading, please see the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : How to Obtain Microsoft Support Files from Online
               Services

   If you do not have Internet access and the driver you need is not
   available from the MSDL, you may need to contact your printer's
   manufacturer directly to see if a newer driver is available.

   If you install a newer printer driver and the problem remains,
   use the first workaround (enable "Print TrueType as graphics").

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, you can use the various tools on the Drawing toolbar to
create drawing objects or AutoShapes within your worksheets. Such objects
float above the worksheet, in an area known as the drawing layer.
<P>
When you view or print preview a worksheet that contains such drawing
objects, the objects appear in front of cells in the worksheet. This is
correct behavior.
<P>
However, some printer drivers contain a problem that will cause text behind
drawing objects and AutoShapes to print in front of them instead. If you
print a worksheet and the text and objects print incorrectly, you should
follow one or both of the workarounds in the RESOLUTION section to
eliminate the problem.
