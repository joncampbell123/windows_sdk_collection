The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Windows 95
<LI>Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition
<LI>Macintosh Operating System, version 8.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In the versions of Microsoft Excel listed at the beginning of this article,
when you attempt to open a workbook, you may receive the following error
message:
<P>
<PRE>   '&lt;File name&gt;' could not be found. Check the spelling of the file name,
   and verify that the file location is correct.

   If you are trying to open the file from your list of most recently
   used files on the File menu, make sure that the file has not been
   renamed, moved, or deleted.

</PRE>In the error message, &lt;File name&gt; contains one or more underscore
characters (_) or question marks (?).
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may occur if the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>The file name of the workbook contains one or more Unicode characters.
   Usually, this occurs only if the workbook has been saved from a foreign-
   language version of Microsoft Excel that supports Unicode characters in
   file names.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -and-
</PRE>
<LI>You are running Microsoft Excel under an operating system that does
   not support Unicode characters in file names, for example:
<P>
   - The U.S. English language version of Microsoft Windows 95
<P>
<P><PRE>      -or-
</PRE><P>
   - The U.S. English language edition version of the Macintosh operating
<P><PRE>     system
</PRE><P>
</UL>Note that because Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 supports Unicode characters in
file names, this problem does not occur when you run programs under
Microsoft Windows NT 4.0.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this behavior use the following appropriate work around.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1: Under Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 or DBCS Microsoft Windows 95</h3>
 
<P>
If you are using a computer running either Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 or a
version of Microsoft Windows 95 that supports Unicode characters in file
names, you can use Microsoft Windows Explorer to rename the workbook so
that its name does not contain Unicode characters. After you rename the
workbook, you can open it in Microsoft Excel.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 2: Under U.S. English Language Version of Microsoft Windows 95</h3>
 
<P>
If you are running a non-Unicode version of Microsoft Windows 95, you
cannot use Microsoft Windows Explorer to rename the workbook. To rename the
workbook, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Open the workbook in the version of Microsoft Excel that created the
   workbook.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Save As. Change the name of the workbook so
   that it does not contain any Unicode characters.

<P><LI>Click Save.
<P>
</OL>After you save the workbook with a name that does not contain Unicode
characters, you can open the workbook in Microsoft Excel.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 3: Under a Non-Unicode System for the Macintosh Computer</h3>
 
<P>
If you are running on a Macintosh computer under an operating system
that does not support Unicode, you cannot use the Finder to rename the
workbook. To rename the workbook, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Open the workbook in the version of Microsoft Excel that created the
   workbook.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Save As. Change the name of the workbook
   so that it does not contain any Unicode characters.

<P><LI>Click Save.
<P>
</OL>After you save the workbook with a name that does not contain Unicode
characters, you can open the workbook in Microsoft Excel.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Because their alphabets use characters that are not in the standard ASCII
character set, the following foreign-language versions of Microsoft Excel
support Unicode characters in file names:
<P>
<PRE>   Japanese
   Chinese
   Korean
   Arabic
   Hebrew
   Thai
   Vietnamese

</PRE></OL>When you save a workbook in any of these versions of Microsoft Excel, you
have the option of including Unicode characters in the name of the
workbook. If you do this and you then attempt to open the workbook on a
computer running an operating system that does not support Unicode, you may
encounter the following problems:

<UL><LI>In versions of Microsoft Windows 95 that do not support Unicode, the
   Unicode characters in the workbook file name are displayed as underscore
   characters. In addition, you cannot open the workbook.
<P>
   If you attempt to rename the workbook, you receive the following error
   message
<P>
<P><PRE>      Cannot rename &lt;Filename&gt;: Cannot find the specified file.
      Make sure you specify the correct path and filename.
</PRE><P>
   and the workbook is not renamed.

<LI>In versions of the Macintosh operating system that do not support
   Unicode, the Unicode characters in the file name are displayed as
   question marks. You cannot open the workbook, and you cannot rename
   the workbook.

<LI>In Microsoft Windows NT 4.0, the Unicode characters in the workbook
   file name are displayed as square characters. However, you can open
   the workbook, and you do not receive an error message when you rename
   the workbook.
