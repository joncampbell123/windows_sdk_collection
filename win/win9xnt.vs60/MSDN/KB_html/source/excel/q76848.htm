</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
After installing PowerPoint for Windows, the screen font used by Excel
and other applications for menus, dialogs, and so on may become
extremely large. For example, the screen font that is used by Excel
for the formula bar, status bar, and so on will be changed to a font
so large that not all messages, options, or dialog boxes will be
legible.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs when the screen fonts that were originally being
used on your system are the wrong resolution for the video driver
currently installed. For example, you may be using regular VGA screen
fonts while you have a high-resolution or 8514/A video driver
installed. This situation may occur if your system was originally set
up for standard VGA, and then you later installed a high-resolution
driver without installing the appropriate high-resolution fonts for
it.
<P>
<P><h3>Solution</h3>
 
<P>
If you have this problem, install the appropriate set of screen fonts
from the original Windows disks, as follows:

<OL><P><LI>From the Control Panel, select Fonts.

<P><LI>Choose the Add button.

<P><LI>Select the appropriate font file(s).
<P>
</OL>You can also achieve this task without using the Windows Control
Panel, as follows:

<OL><P><LI>Use the EXPAND.EXE utility to decompress and copy the appropriate
   font files from the Windows Setup disks to the WINDOWS\SYSTEM
   subdirectory.

<P><LI>Modify the [fonts] section of the WIN.INI file to point to the
   location of those new font files.
<P>
</OL>When an application requests a font for display, a font is provided by
Windows from the list of available screen fonts in the WIN.INI file.
Preference is given to those fonts that match the screen resolution of
the video driver installed. If you have installed Windows for the VGA
video driver, Excel requests Helv 10 pt for use in the formula bar and
the status bar uses the font closest to Helv 10 (VGA Res). This font
is included in the file HELVE.FON. If that font is not installed, the
system will attempt to pick an appropriate substitute, choosing from
fonts with the correct resolution first.
<P>
When you install PowerPoint for Windows, you may also install the
large screen fonts that come with it. PowerPoint for Windows will
install the set of large fonts that are appropriate for the video
driver being used by Windows. One of the fonts that will be installed
is Helv 36 point. If no other Helv screen font of the appropriate
resolution is currently on the system, Windows will choose Helv 36 as
the best substitute, resulting in the large text under the icons in
Program Manager.
