<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Utility programs for personal computers often include a file recovery
utility that you can use to recover damaged or corrupted files. Various
third-party utility applications, including Symantec's Norton Utilities
version 7.0 and Central Point Software's PC Tools version 8.0 for MS-DOS,
contain file recovery utilities that are capable of recovering damaged
Microsoft Excel worksheet files.
<P>
NOTE: Norton Utilities versions 7.0 and 8.0 cannot recover data from
Microsoft Excel 4.0 workbooks.
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, another way to recover damaged worksheets is through
external linking. In certain cases, you can link a new worksheet to a
damaged sheet and recover the last evaluated result in each cell.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
For more information about linking worksheets to recover corrupted files,
query on the following words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>

file using a file recovery utility program, such as those mentioned above.
