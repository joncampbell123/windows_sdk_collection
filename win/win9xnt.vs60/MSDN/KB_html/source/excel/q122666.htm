<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, version 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows NT, version 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel version 5.0 for the Macintosh and Microsoft Excel
version 5.0 for Windows NT, the DSUM() and DAVERAGE() functions may return
incorrect results if you are using computed criteria for your database.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When you use computed criteria, the DSUM() and DAVERAGE() functions return
only the first record in the database that matches the criteria.
<P>
Note that the DCOUNT() function works correctly even if you use computed
criteria.
<P>
This problem does not occur in Microsoft Excel versions 5.0 and 5.0c for
Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To avoid this problem, you can use the following Visual Basic procedure.
When you run the procedure, you are prompted to enter the name of the field 
in the database for which you would like to compute the DSUM(). For
example, if your DSUM() formula would appear as follows
<P>
<PRE>   =DSUM(Database,"Bravo",Criteria)

</PRE>then enter "Bravo" (without the quotation marks) in the dialog box that
prompts you to enter a field name. Once you enter the field name, the
procedure computes the correct DSUM value and enters that value in the
active cell in the worksheet.

 End Sub
 '-----------------------------------------------------------------------

</PRE>To use this procedure, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Select the cell in which you want the DSUM result to appear.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Macro.

<P><LI>In the Macro Name/Reference list, click NewDSUM. Then, click Run.

<P><LI>When you are prompted to enter a field name, enter the field name and
   click OK.
<P>
</OL>The correct DSUM() value should appear in the active cell. If you enter
an invalid field name, an error message will appear in the cell instead.
<P>
To compute the DAVERAGE() function, use the NewDSUM subroutine to
compute the DSUM value. Then, enter the following formula
<P>
<PRE>   =&lt;DSUMCell&gt;/DCOUNT(Database,&lt;FieldName&gt;,Criteria)

</PRE></OL>where &lt;DSUMCell&gt; is the cell that contains the DSUM value and
&lt;FieldName&gt; is the field name in the database.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in
Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, version 5.0a.
