The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0c
<LI>Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, versions 5.0, 5.0a
</UL> 
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you open a workbook or worksheet in Microsoft Excel version 4.0, if
the worksheet has been saved from Microsoft Excel version 5.0, you may
receive one of the following error messages and you may not be unable to 
open the workbook.
<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft Excel for Windows
   ---------------------------

   A document with that name is a supporting document. Workbooks can't be
   supporting documents.

   Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh
   ---------------------------------

   Workbooks cannot be supporting documents.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs if a formula in the current worksheet (dependent
document) contains a formula with a link to a workbook (source document)
that has been saved from Microsoft Excel version 5.0, and the link is to a
worksheet with the same name as the workbook it is contained in. In
Microsoft Excel version 5.0, when you save a workbook as a Microsoft Excel
version 4.0 workbook or worksheet that contains a link to another
worksheet, the link may be saved with only the workbook in the reference if
the source worksheet has the same name as the workbook it is contained in.
For example, the reference
<P>
<PRE>   =[SALES.XLW]Sales!$A$1 (in Windows)

</PRE>appears as
<P>
<PRE>   ='C:\EXCEL\SALES.XLW'!$A$1

</PRE>(where C:\EXCEL is the full path to the source document) when it is saved
as a Microsoft Excel 4.0 worksheet or workbook and opened in Microsoft
Excel version 4.0.
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 4.0, when the worksheet with this link is open, you will
be unable to open the workbook that the link is referring to.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
In order to open both a source workbook and a dependent worksheet that have
been saved in the Microsoft Excel version 4.0 format, do either of the
following:

<UL><LI>If Microsoft Excel version 5.0 is available, open the workbook that
   contains the worksheet with the same name, and rename the worksheet.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE>
<LI>If Microsoft Excel version 5.0 is not available, change the link on the
   dependent file by doing the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>    1. In Microsoft Excel version 4.0, open the dependent worksheet. Choose
       No to update references to unopened documents.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    2. From the File menu, choose Links.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    3. From the Links list, choose the link to the source workbook and
       choose Change. From the File Name list, choose the source workbook
       and choose OK.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    4. From the Select The Bound Document list, choose the source
       worksheet. In the Links dialog box, choose Close.
