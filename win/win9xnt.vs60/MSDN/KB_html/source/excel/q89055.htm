1. Q. In the Page Setup dialog box, certain options are
      unavailable. How can I access these options?

   A. A commonly requested feature for version 3.0 of Microsoft Excel
      for Windows was the ability to use the Reduce/Enlarge option and
      the Fit To Page option for a wider range of printers. Microsoft
      Excel 4.0 now supports these scaling features for all printer
      drivers. Other document setting options, however, may still not
      be available.

      If certain options are unavailable, the currently selected
      printer driver does not support those particular extended
      options. For example, dot-matrix and plotter drivers do not
      support orientation and paper size settings in the Page Setup
      dialog box. Other drivers may support only one of these
      features. If a setting is unavailable in the Page Setup dialog
      box, you may be able to edit that setting in the Printer Setup
      dialog box.

      NOTE: All the Page Setup options are available for the Hewlett-
      Packard(R) LaserJet(R) drivers.

2. Q. I understand that a new feature in version 4.0 of Microsoft
      Excel for Windows is the ability to create multiple-line headers
      and footers. How can I do this?

   A. The creation and modification of headers and footers in
      Microsoft Excel 4.0 has been greatly simplified. You no longer
      have to use control codes for alignment or font selection, and
      you can insert a page number, date, time, or filename with the
      simple click of a button. In addition, you can create multiple-
      line headers and footers by pressing ALT+ENTER where you want to
      insert a carriage return.

      To create a multiple-line header or footer:

      1. From the File menu, choose Page Setup.

      2. Choose either the Header button or the Footer button.

      3. Select the Left, Center, or Right section depending on
         where you want the text to be aligned on the page. To select
         the section with a mouse, click inside the appropriate
         section box. If you do not have a mouse, hold down the ALT
         key and press the underlined letter corresponding to the
         desired section.

      4. Enter some text in the box. At the point where you want to
         insert a carriage return, press ALT+ENTER.

3. Q. I want to start page numbering with a number greater than 1.
      How can I do this?

   A. To begin page numbering with a number greater than 1:

      1. From the File menu, choose Page Setup.

      2. Choose either the Header button or the Footer button.

      3. The default footer lists "Page &amp;P" in the Center alignment
         section. If you prefer to align your page number to the left
         or the right, select the appropriate section. To select it
         with a mouse, click inside the appropriate section box. If
         you do not have a mouse, hold down the ALT key and press the
         underlined letter corresponding to the desired section.

      4. If you have selected an alternate section and are using a
         mouse, click the button marked with the number sign (#). This
         places "&amp;P" in the box. If you are not using a mouse, type
         "&amp;P" (without the quotation marks).

      5. To begin page numbering at a number greater than 1, after
         the P, insert a plus sign (+) and the number you want the
         numbering to start with, minus 1. For example, if you want
         the page numbering to begin with the number 3, insert a plus
         sign and the number 2 following "&amp;P."

4. Q. I have placed a manual page break in my document, but when I
      print it with the Fit To option button selected in the Page
      Setup dialog box, version 4.0 of Microsoft Excel for Windows
      seems to ignore the page break. Why is this happening?

   A. Microsoft Excel 4.0 was designed to ignore manual page breaks
      when the Fit To option button is selected. To make Microsoft
      Excel recognize manual page breaks when the Fit To option button
      is selected:

      1. From the File menu, choose Page Setup.

      2. In the Page Setup dialog box, select the Fit To option
         button and specify the number of pages wide and the number of
         pages tall that you want for your final output. Choose the OK
         button.

      3. From the File menu, choose Print Preview. Microsoft Excel
         calculates the reduction necessary to fit the document to the
         specified size.

      4. In Print Preview, choose the Page Setup button to display
         the Page Setup dialog box.

      5. Under Scaling, select the Reduce/Enlarge option button.
         The percentage of reduction necessary should automatically
         appear in the corresponding box.

      6. Choose the OK button. Microsoft Excel now recognizes any
         page breaks you have set.

      The reduction calculated by Microsoft Excel may need to be
      adjusted slightly depending on the placement of the manual page
      breaks.

      For more information on printing, please refer to Book 1,
      Chapter 16 of the "Microsoft Excel User's Guide."

5. Q. When I print my document, the columns set as print titles
      print correctly; however, some columns are duplicated on the
      same page, and columns from previous pages are repeated on
      subsequent pages. What is happening?

   A. Scaling a multiple-page document with columns set as print
      titles produces unexpected results in version 4.0 of Microsoft
      Excel for Windows if you print to a non-PostScript(R) printer.

      Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Excel
      4.0. Currently, the only ways you can work around this problem
      are to not use columns as print titles, to use a Reduce/Enlarge
      setting of 100 percent, or to print to a PostScript printer.
