<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0c
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, versions 7.0, 7.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 5.0, you may receive a general protection (GP) fault if
you copy and paste lines of code that contain the line-continuation
character (_) in a Visual Basic subroutine.
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 7.0, you may receive the following error message if you
copy and paste lines of code that contain the line-continuation character
(_) in a Visual Basic subroutine:
<P>
<PRE>   Too many line continuations

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
You receive the GP Fault if you copy lines in a Visual Basic procedure that
contain line-continuation characters, and paste the lines in a procedure so
that there are more than a total of ten consecutive lines joined with
line-continuation characters.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the versions of Microsoft
Excel listed above. This problem was fixed in Microsoft Excel 97.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To prevent this error from occurring, do not copy and paste lines that end
in line-continuation characters if the resulting code will contain more
than nine consecutive lines that end with the line-continuation character.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you enter code in a Visual Basic module in Microsoft Excel, you can
use an underscore (_) as a line-continuation character. When you type this
character at the end of a line, the next line is appended to the current
line when you run the subroutine.
<P>
For example, when you run the following code
<P>
<PRE>   Example = "Test 1 " &amp; _
      "Test 2"

</PRE>the line is evaluated as if you typed it as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   Example = "Test 1 " &amp; "Test 2"

</PRE>Normally, you can type up to nine consecutive lines with line-continuation
characters. If you type a tenth consecutive line with a line-continuation
character, you will receive the error message
<P>
<PRE>   Too many line continuations

</PRE>and the tenth line-continuation character is automatically removed.
<P>
However, when you copy and paste consecutive lines that end in a line-
continuation character, you can easily exceed the nine line limit. When you
do this, you receive the error message above as expected. Additionally, the
screen may be redrawn incorrectly; lines in your procedure may be missing
and others may display twice. You may also receive a GP Fault.
