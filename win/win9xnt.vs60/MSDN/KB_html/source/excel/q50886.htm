<P>
You can use the special text operator "&amp;" to concatenate (string together)
several text values. The following are examples of how concatenation can be
used:

<OL><P><LI>Use the ampersand (&amp;) to join two or more text values into a new text
   value. If cell A2 contains the text entry Jim, and cell B3 contains the
   text entry McDevit, use the following formulas:
<P>
<PRE>      Formula             Text Value
                          Produced
      --------------------------------------

      =A2&amp;B3              JimMcDevit
      =A2&amp;" "&amp;B3          Jim McDevit
      =B3&amp;", "&amp;A2         McDevit, Jim
      ="Mr. "&amp;B3&amp;", "&amp;A2  Mr. McDevit, Jim

</PRE><P><LI>Use concatenation in combination with macro functions. For example,
   suppose you want to be able to open any of your monthly inventory
   worksheets by specifying the month of the inventory. The names of your
   monthly inventory worksheets vary by a string of text: Western.Jan,
   Western.Feb, Western.Mar, and Western.Apr. Use the INPUT command to
   specify the month, and use the following sequence of commands to
   concatenate the month with "Western.":
<P>
<PRE>      B6:   =SET.NAME("Month",INPUT("Enter the month:",2))
      B7:   =OPEN("Western."&amp;Month)

   Entering the month in the proper format for the input dialog box will
   open the corresponding worksheet for that month.

</PRE><P><LI>Use concatenation in a macro to string together a formula and display
   the new formula in the formula bar.
<P>
   For example, if the active cell contains the number 2 and a macro is run
   containing the command
<P>
<P><PRE>      =FORMULA("="&amp;ACTIVE.CELL()&amp;"*100")
</PRE><P>
   then the active cell will display 200, and the formula bar will display
   =2*100.
