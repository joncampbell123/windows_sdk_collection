<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, when you use the Consolidate dialog box to consolidate
data, you can enter a full path to a file that contains data that you want
to consolidate in the References box.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This is not documented as an option. Including a path is useful when you
refer to cells in an unopened document located in a directory or drive
other than the current path. You can save links to the source data file as
usual, and if the data that you want to consolidate is contained in a
worksheet file, rather than a workbook, you can use wildcard characters in
the filename.
<P>
The "current path" is the path from which files will be opened when you
select Open from the File menu. If you enter the current path in the
References box in the Consolidate dialog box, the path will disappear when
the reference is added to the All References list. To retain the path
information in the All References list, choose Open from the File menu and
change the current path in the File Name box before you enter the reference
in the Consolidate dialog box.
<P>
<P><h3>Examples</h3>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel version 5.0, or in Microsoft Excel version 4.0 when the
data that you want to consolidate is contained on a bound worksheet in a
workbook file, if you enter the following path as your source reference in
the Reference box
<P>
<PRE>   c:\excel\library\[Sales.xls]Sheet1!$B$1 (for Windows)

   -or-

   Hard Drive:Excel:library:[Sales]Sheet1!$B$1 (for Macintosh)

</PRE>Microsoft Excel will return the values from cell $B$1 on Sheet1 from each
document located in the directory or folder noted above.
<P>
In Microsoft Excel version 3.0, or in Microsoft Excel version 4.0 when the
data that you want to consolidate is contained in a worksheet file, if you
enter the following path as your source reference in the Reference box
<P>
<PRE>   c:\excel\library\sales*.xls!$B$1 (for Windows)


   -or-

   Hard Drive:Excel:library:sales*!$B$1 (for Macintosh)

</PRE>Microsoft Excel will return the values from cell $B$1 from each document
(located in the directory or folder noted above) that has SALES as the
first five characters of the filename.
