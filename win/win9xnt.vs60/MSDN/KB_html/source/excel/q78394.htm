<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
PostScript printer drivers provide the option to reduce or enlarge a
Microsoft Excel chart by a certain percentage if the size chosen under
Page Setup is Screen Size. If Fit To Page or Full Page is selected as
the size, the Reduce Or Enlarge percentage should be ignored; however,
any text that exists in the chart is scaled even though it should not
be.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To reduce or enlarge a chart, choose Page Setup from the File menu and
select Screen Size. If Screen Size has been selected and the Reduce Or
Enlarge percentage is changed to something other than 100, the chart
prints according to the selected percentage. If the Fit To Page or
Full Page option is then selected, Reduce Or Enlarge is no longer a
selectable option. However, any chart text reads the previously
selected percentage, and scales the text to that percentage.
<P>
<P><h3>Workaround</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>From the File menu, choose Page Setup.

<P><LI>Select Screen Size as the Size option and change the percentage to
   100%.

<P><LI>Reselect your original Size option and choose the OK button to
   close the dialog box.
<P>
</OL><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Verify that you are using a Windows PostScript driver by choosing
   Printer Setup from the File menu.

<P><LI>Create a chart and include a title on the chart.

<P><LI>Select the title in the chart. Choose Font from the Format menu and
   select TMS RMN 24. Choose the OK button.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Print Preview. Note the size of the
   title on the preview screen.

<P><LI>From the Print Preview dialog box, choose the Setup button. The Fit
   To Page option should be currently selected under Size, and Reduce
   Or Enlarge should be unavailable (dimmed).

<P><LI>Select Screen Size under Size to make the Reduce Or Enlarge option
   available (not dimmed). Enter 50 into the percentage box (following
   Reduce Or Enlarge).

<P><LI>Select Fit To Page. Notice that the Reduce Or Enlarge option is
   unavailable (dimmed) again, although the 50 is still visible in the
   percentage box.

<P><LI>Choose OK to close the Setup dialog.
<P>
</OL>Notice that the title in the chart has been significantly reduced even
though the rest of the chart remains the same size.
<P>
Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information
here as it becomes available.
