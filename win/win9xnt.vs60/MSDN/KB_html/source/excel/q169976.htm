The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 97, if you close a workbook that was saved in the
Microsoft Excel 4.0 Worksheet format, you may receive the following error
message:
<P>
<PRE>   This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down.
   If the problem persists, contact the program vendor.

</PRE>If you click Details, you receive an error message similar to either of the
following appears:
<P>
<PRE>   EXCEL caused an invalid page fault in module EXCEL.EXE at
   0137:30217df8.

   -or-

   EXCEL caused an invalid page fault in module MSO97.DLL at
   0137:306c34b9.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may occur if the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>An open workbook (for example, Book1) contains a formula that refers
   to a cell in a worksheet with a name that is the same as the workbook
   name that contains the worksheet, for example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      =[Book3.xls]Book3!A1
</PRE>
<LI>The workbook referenced in the formula is closed.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -and-
</PRE>
<LI>You save another workbook (for example, Book2) in the Microsoft Excel
   4.0 Worksheet format. When you save the worksheet, you use the same
   name as the name used in the formula (Book3.xls), but you save the
   worksheet in a different folder.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -and-
</PRE>
<LI>You then close Book3.xls, switch to Book1.xls, and then edit the formula
   that refers to the closed workbook.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this problem, when you save a worksheet in the Microsoft Excel
4.0 Worksheet format, do not give the worksheet the same name as another
workbook that is referenced by a formula in an open workbook.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Because the problem described in this article occurs only when you save a
worksheet in the Microsoft Excel 4.0 Worksheet format, you are not likely
to encounter this problem. If you must save worksheets in the Microsoft
Excel 4.0 Worksheet format, use the resolution in this article to prevent
the problem from occurring.
