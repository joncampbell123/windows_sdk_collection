The following article explains the difference between line and scatter
charts.
<P>
It is a common misconception that if you want to plot a line on a
chart that you use a line chart, when in many cases, a scatter chart
is the appropriate chart to use.
<P>
The main difference between a line chart and a scatter chart is that a
line chart's x-axis is not scaled, i.e., it has a fixed interval
between each category. For example, if you are trying to plot a line
and have 1,2,10 as x values, the distance between 1 and 2 on a line
chart is the same as the distance between 2 and 10. If you use a
scatter chart with the same x values, the distance between 1 and 2 is
one unit while the distance between 2 and 10 is eight units.
