<P>
January 1998
(c) Microsoft Corporation, 1998
<P>
The Workbook Consolidation Wizard is an add-in program for Microsoft
Excel 97 that you can use to consolidate worksheets from one or more
workbooks into a single master workbook. Currently the only way to
perform this task is to use the Move Or Copy Sheet command on the
Edit menu, manually copy the sheets and then paste them, or drag the
sheets from one workbook to another one. These methods may require a
significant amount of time if you want to consolidate many workbooks
or worksheets. Using the Workbook Consolidation Wizard is more
efficient than using a manual method because the wizard contains
options that make consolidating workbooks easier.

</UL><h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
 
<P>
After you download Consolid.exe from the Microsoft Software Library
and double-click it to extract Consolid.xla, the Workbook
Consolidation Wizard, you must copy the wizard and the ReadMe.txt
file to the correct folder, and then load the wizard before you can
run it.
<P>
Installing the Wizard:
<P>
To copy and load the wizard, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Copy Consolid.xla and ReadMe.txt to the Office\Library folder in
   the Microsoft Office folder (The default installation folder for
   Office 97 is C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office).

<P><LI>Start Excel 97.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Add-Ins.

<P><LI>Select the Workbook Consolidation Wizard check box and click OK.
<P>
</OL>Running the Wizard:
<P>
NOTE: For performance reasons, do not switch to another program
while the Workbook Consolidation Wizard is running. Microsoft
Excel must remain the active program until the wizard is finished.
<P>
To run the wizard, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Wizard, and then click Workbook
   Consolidation Wizard.

<P><LI>In step 1 of the wizard, select the folder that contains the files
   you want to consolidate. If you click Browse to view a folder, you
   can do either of the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Option 1:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>         Select the folder location to indicate that you want to
         consolidate all Excel files in that folder.

         NOTE: You must select the "Consolidate all workbooks in the
         source folder" check box in step 2 of the wizard to complete
         this option.

      Option 2:

         Select only the files you want to consolidate.

         NOTE: If "Consolidate all workbooks in the source folder"
         in step 2 of the wizard is selected, this option is
         overridden, and all files in the selected folder are
         consolidated.

</PRE><P><LI>In step 2 of the wizard, specify how you want the wizard to
   consolidate workbooks or worksheets.
<P>
   By default, the currently selected path is displayed at the top
   of the dialog box.
<P>
   In this dialog box, the maximum number of options that can be
   selected at any one time is three. The following four options
   are available:
<P>
   "Consolidate all workbooks in the source folder"
<P>
<P><PRE>      Use this option when you want all Excel files in the currently
      selected folder to be consolidated. This feature overrides any
      files you manually select after clicking Browse in step 1 of
      the wizard.
</PRE><P>
   "Consolidate only the active sheet in each workbook"
<P>
<P><PRE>      Use this option when you want only the active sheet in each
      opened workbook to be consolidated.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      NOTE: When you use this option, "Prompt for which sheets to
      copy in each workbook" is not available because you have elected
      to import only the active sheet in each workbook.
</PRE><P>
   "Consolidate sheets in each workbook"
<P>
<P><PRE>      Use this option when you want to consolidate all sheets in each
      opened workbook. You can also enhance this option by selecting
      the "Prompt for which sheets to copy in each workbook" check
      box. When you do this, you are prompted to select the sheets
      you want to import in each workbook that you opened for
      consolidation.
</PRE><P>
   "Prompt for which sheets to copy in each workbook"
<P>
<P><PRE>      Use this option when you want to select the sheets you want
      to import in each workbook you select for consolidation.
</PRE>
<P><LI>In step 3 of the wizard, either the Process Selected Sheets or the
   Process Sheets dialog box appears. The Process Selected Sheets
   dialog box appears if you have selected "Prompt for which sheets
   to copy in each workbook" in step 2 of the wizard.
<P>
   If you do not select "Prompt for which sheets to copy in each
   workbook" in step 2 of the wizard, the Process Sheets dialog box
   appears in step 3 of the wizard.
<P>
   NOTE: You can cancel the Workbook Consolidation Wizard at any time.
<P>
</OL><h3>ADDITIONAL NOTES</h3>
 

<UL><LI>When you start the Workbook Consolidation Wizard, the active
   workbook is the location in which all imported sheets are placed.

<LI>After you use the Workbook Consolidation Wizard, a sheet named
   WCW97EndSheet appears. This sheet is inserted by the Workbook
   Consolidation Wizard as a separator sheet when you import
   workbook sheets. This sheet is intended to be an organizational
   aid.
<P>
   After the Workbook Consolidation Wizard is finished, all
   imported sheets appear to the left of this separator sheet. You
   can delete the WCW97EndSheet separator sheet whenever you like.
   Each time the Workbook Consolidation Wizard is used, a new
   WCW97EndSheet sheet is inserted.
<P>
<P><PRE>      NOTE: If a sheet named WCW97EndSheet already exists when you use
      the Workbook Consolidation Wizard, the wizard does not insert the
      separator sheet and uses the existing sheet as the separator
      sheet.
</PRE>
<LI>When the "Workbook Consolidation Wizard - Process Selected Sheets"
   dialog box is displayed in step 3 of the wizard, objects that are
   located behind the dialog box may appear with a double image or
   with a shadow. This shadowing effect may look unusual but does not
   affect the functionality of the wizard itself. The shadowing
   effect is typically caused by third-party video drivers while using
   a high resolution (for example, 800x600 or higher). You can resolve
   this issue by changing the video driver to Standard video graphics
   adapter (VGA), which is supplied with Microsoft(R) Windows(R) 95,
   Microsoft(R) Windows NT(R) Workstation version 3.51, or Microsoft
   Windows NT Workstation version 4.0.

<LI>Excel files that are password protected, contain external links, or
   use an Auto_Open or Workbooks_Open event are treated as if you
   manually opened the files. Workbooks that are password protected
   and workbooks with external links should not be problematic;
   however, workbooks with macros that automatically run may be
   problematic. This is true because the procedure that automatically
   runs may initiate a process that may conflict with a process that
   the wizard initiates. Microsoft recommends that you disable all
   macros that run automatically in the workbooks that you want to use
   with the Workbook Consolidation Wizard.

<LI>The length of time it takes to consolidate workbooks depends on the
   number of workbooks you want to consolidate, the size of each
   workbook, and the number of sheets per imported workbook.
<P>
</UL><h3>POTENTIAL ISSUES</h3>
 
<P>
Some links may be created as a result of using this wizard. These
links are the same links that are created when you manually copy
or move sheets from one workbook to another. The following links
may be created: formula links, defined name links, or hidden name
links.
<P>
You can remove formula links by using information in Microsoft
Knowledge Base article <B><A href="../excel/q126093.htm">Q126093</A></B>. The title of this article is "Macros
to Delete Formula Links." The wizard maintains defined name links in
sheets that already contain defined names that link to other sheets.
You can remove these links by using article <B><A href="../vbapps/q138619.htm">Q138619</A></B>, "Macro to Delete
Defined Names with Links." Hidden name links are used when data from
Microsoft Query is returned to a sheet. You can remove these links
by using article <B><A href="../vbapps/q119826.htm">Q119826</A></B>, "Macro to Remove Hidden Names in Active
Workbook." Article <B><A href="../excel/q136314.htm">Q136314</A></B>, "Copying Sheets Between Workbooks Can
Create Unexpected Links" is also helpful.
