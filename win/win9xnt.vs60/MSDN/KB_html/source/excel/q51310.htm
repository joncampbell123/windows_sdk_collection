The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, versions 1.0, 1.5, 2.2
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 2.0, 2.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you start Microsoft Excel, you may receive the following error
message:
<P>
<PRE>   Can't open or save more documents

</PRE>When you receive this error message, you are not able to open any more
saved files or save any previously unsaved files in Microsoft Excel.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
You receive this error message if Microsoft Excel is accessing the maximum
number of files allowed by the Macintosh System (approximately 32 depending
on the version of Microsoft Excel you are using). This error message
appears when there is not enough memory to open or save any more documents.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To open more documents or save a currently open document with read and
write access, use one of the following methods:
<P>
Method 1: Close documents you no longer need.
<P>
Method 2: Close and then reopen some of your documents as read-only.
<PRE>          (Read-only documents require less memory than documents with read
          and write access.)

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
After you receive this error message, you can still create additional
documents by choosing New from the File menu, but you cannot save these
files until you have closed some of the currently open saved files. There
is no limit, except available memory, to the number of new, unsaved files
that can be open at one time.
<P>
Note: It is possible that Microsoft Excel version 2.2 generates this error
message when Microsoft Excel version 1.5 does not, because Microsoft Excel
2.2 opens and maintains an "Excel Settings" file. This reduces by one the
number of files that can be opened in Microsoft Excel 2.2.
