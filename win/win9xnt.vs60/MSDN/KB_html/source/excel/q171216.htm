The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you open a password-protected workbook in Microsoft Excel 97 and enter
the password, you may receive the following message:
<P>
<PRE>   This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down.
   If the problem persists, contact the program vendor.

</PRE>If you click Details, you receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   EXCEL caused an invalid page fault in module EXCEL.EXE at
   0137:30036924.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may occur if the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>The workbook contains one or more merged cells.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -and-
</PRE>
<LI>The workbook was protected with a Password To Open password.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -and-
</PRE>
<LI>The computer is using French regional settings.
<P>
</UL>Note that the versions of Microsoft Windows 95 and Microsoft Excel 97
may both be English language versions.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To correct this problem, install Microsoft Excel 97 Service Release 1
(SR-1).
<P>
To work around this problem, switch the regional settings on the computer
to English before you attempt to open the workbook again. To do this,
follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Start menu, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

<P><LI>Double-click Regional Settings. Click the Regional Settings tab.

<P><LI>In the list of regional settings, click "English (United States)" or
   another English setting. Then, click OK.

<P><LI>When you are prompted to restart the computer, do so.
<P>
</OL>After the computer has restarted, start Microsoft Excel 97 and open the
workbook. If the problem still occurs, there may be another cause that
prevents you from opening the workbook; if the workbook is opened
correctly, unmerge the merged cells or remove the password from the
workbook before you save and close the workbook.
<P>
After you modify the workbook, you should be able to switch back to the
original regional settings and open the workbook.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Excel 97. This
problem was corrected in Microsoft Excel 97 SR-1.
<P>
