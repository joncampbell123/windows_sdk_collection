1. Q. I don't want to print my entire worksheet. How can I print a specific
      range that includes row and column titles each time I print my
      worksheet?

   A. If you print the same range repeatedly, set a print area before you
      print. When you set a print area, you can also specify rows or
      columns that you want to repeat on every page.

      To set a print area in Microsoft Excel 7.0 or in Microsoft Excel 97,
      select the range you want to print, point to Print Area on the File
      menu, and then click Set Print Area.

      To set a print area in all versions of Microsoft Excel, do the
      following:

      1. Click the worksheet that contains the data you want to print.

      2. On the File menu, click Page Setup.

      3. Click the Sheet tab.

      4. In the Print Area box, specify the range or ranges on the
         worksheet that you want to print. You can also type cell
         references or defined names in the Print Area box.

      To set print titles in all versions of Microsoft Excel, do the
      following:

      1. Click the worksheet that contains the data you want to print.

      2. On the File menu, click Page Setup.

      3. Click the Sheet tab.

      4. To print titles at the top of every page, click the Rows to Repeat
         at Top box under Print Titles.

         -or-

         To print titles at the left of every page, click the Columns to
         Repeat at Left box under Print Titles.

      5. Switch to the worksheet, and then select the rows or columns that
         you want to print on each page.

        You can also type a cell reference or a defined name in the Rows to
        Repeat at Top box or the Columns to Repeat at Left box.

      6. To close the Page Setup dialog box, click OK.

      7. To print, click Print.

      When you print the selected sheet, only the specified print area is
      printed.

      If you do not want row or column titles, or if you want to print the
      worksheet range only once, you can print a selected range by doing
      the following:

      1. Select the range you want to print.

      2. On the File menu, click Print.

      3. Under Print What, click Selection.

      4. Click OK.

      For additional information in Microsoft Excel 97, click the Index tab
      in Microsoft Excel Help, type the following text:

         print areas

      and then double-click the selected text to go to the "Print a
      specific area of a worksheet" topic.

      For additional information in Microsoft Excel 7.0, click the Index
      tab in Microsoft Excel Help, type the following text:

       printing, specifying what to print

      and then double-click the selected text to go to the "Print a sheet,
      a selected range, or an entire workbook" topic.

      For additional information in Microsoft Excel 5.0, see "Setting Up
      What You Want to Print" in Chapter 14 of the User's Guide.

2. Q. How do I simultaneously print multiple sheets?

   A. To edit or print a selection of sheets in a workbook, press and hold
      down the shift key or the ctrl key while clicking a worksheet tab.
      Press the shift key and click a sheet tab to select all the sheets
      from the active sheet to the last sheet tab you click. To select
      sheets one at a time, press the ctrl key and click each sheet tab.
      When you're in group mode, the grouped sheet tabs are highlighted and
      [Group] appears to the right of the workbook name on the title bar.
      Any data you enter or any formatting you apply to cells in one sheet
      in the group is applied to the corresponding cells in each sheet in
      the group.

      To print the selected sheets in the same workbook, do the following:

      1. On the File menu, click Print.

      2. Under Print What, verify that Selected Sheets is selected and
         click OK.

          Note If you define print areas for any of the selected sheets
          using the Sheet tab of the Page Setup dialog box, only those
          print areas are printed.

      When all the sheets in the workbook are grouped, clicking another
      sheet in the workbook ungroups the sheets. If only some sheets are
      grouped, you can click any sheet in the group and remain in group
      mode. In this case, ungroup the sheets by clicking a sheet tab
      outside the group. Alternatively, you can click a sheet tab in the
      group with the right mouse button and click Ungroup Sheets on the
      shortcut menu.

3. Q. How do I move the default position of the header and footer?

   A. In earlier versions of Microsoft Excel, you cannot change the
      vertical position of headers and footers. In Microsoft Excel 5.0 and
      later, you can set the vertical positions of headers and footers from
      the top and bottom of the page. To set the position, do the
      following:

      1. Select the sheet or sheets containing the header or footer you
         want to change.

      2. On the File menu, click Page Setup.

      3. Click the Margins tab.

      4. In the Header and Footer boxes, enter the distance (in inches) you
         want.

      Note that Microsoft Excel uses the minimum margin setting allowed by
      your printer. In many cases, the minimum size is .25 inch. As a
      result, the header or footer is printed with a .25-inch margin even
      if you set it to something smaller.

      For additional information in Microsoft Excel 97, click the Index tab
      in Microsoft Excel Help, type the following text:

         headers and footers, overview

      and then double-click the selected text to go to the "What to do
      before you print" topic.

      For additional information in Microsoft Excel 7.0, click the Index
      tab in Microsoft Excel Help, type the following text:

       headers and footers

      and then double-click the selected text to go to the "Set header and
      footer margins" topic.

      For additional information in Microsoft Excel 5.0, see "Setting Up
      What You Want to Print" in Chapter 14 of the User's Guide.
