<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, to set a print area that contains adjacent or
nonadjacent cells or cell ranges on a worksheet, do the following:
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Excel versions 5.0 and later</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>From the File menu, choose Page Setup. Select the Sheet tab.

<P><LI>With your cursor in the Print Area box in the Page Setup dialog, select
   the area or areas on your worksheet that include all the sections you
   would like to print. Select the areas by pressing CTRL while you drag
   your mouse, or use the F8 and SHIFT+F8 key sequences. If you select
   nonadjacent areas, each area will be printed on its own page.
<P>
</OL><h3>Microsoft Excel versions 2.x, 3.0 and 4.0</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Select the area or areas that include all the sections you would
   like to print. Select the areas by pressing CTRL while you drag
   your mouse, or use the F8 and SHIFT+F8 key sequences. If you select
   nonadjacent areas, each area will be printed on its own page.

<P><LI>Choose Set Print Area from the Options menu. At this point, the
   print area has been set.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>

following:
<P>

<OL><P><LI>From the Insert menu, choose Name, and then choose Define.

<P><LI>From the Names In Workbook list, select SheetName!Print_Area (where
   SheetName is the name of your worksheet.) The individual cell or range
   references appear separated by commas in the Refers To box, similar to
   the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      =$A$1,$B$1:$C$1,$K$4
</PRE><P>
   The cells or cell ranges that are separated by commas print on
   separate pages.

as Print_Area (not SheetName!Print_Area.)
<P>

list, and choose Delete.
<P>

</PRE><P>
   The cells or cell ranges that are separated by commas print on
   separate pages.
