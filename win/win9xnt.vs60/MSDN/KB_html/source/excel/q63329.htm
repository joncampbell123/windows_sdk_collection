<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
To use Boolean expressions in Microsoft Excel, you must understand
their underlying logic. The basis of Boolean analysis is that
statements that evaluate as TRUE are evaluated as being equal to 1
(one), while statements that evaluate as FALSE are evaluated as being
equal to 0 (zero).
<P>
One of the simplest examples of a Boolean expression is as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   =A1=B1

</PRE>This statement will evaluate as TRUE (1) if the value in cell A1 is
equal to the value in cell B1, and as FALSE (0) otherwise.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following IF() statement performs an operation based on whether or
not A1=B1:
<P>
<PRE>   =IF(A1=B1,A1*5.3,0)

</PRE>This IF() statement compares the value in A1 to the value in B1, and
if the two values are equal, multiplies the value in A1 by 5.3; if the
values are not equal, the value returned is 0 (zero). The following
Boolean formula is functionally equivalent to the previous IF()
statement:
<P>
<PRE>   =(A1=B1)*A1*5.3

</PRE>This formula works in the following manner: if A1=B1, the first part
of the formula (A1=B1) evaluates to TRUE, which Excel evaluates as the
number 1 (one). If A1&lt;&gt;B1, the first part of the formula returns
FALSE, which Excel evaluates as 0 (zero). This is diagrammed as
follows:
<P>
<PRE>   (TRUE)*A1*5.3   equals   1*A1*5.3   equals   A1*5.3,   or
   (FALSE)*A1*5.3  equals   0*A1*5.3   equals   0

</PRE>Sometimes you need to check for more than one condition. Suppose we
have the following problem:
<P>
If the value in cell A1 equals the value in B1, multiply A1 by 5.3. If
the value of A1 equals the value in C1, multiply A1 by 10.6.
Otherwise, return a 0 (zero). (We will assume B1&lt;&gt;C1.)
<P>
The following IF() statement returns the correct results:
<P>
<PRE>   =IF(A1=B1,A1*5.3,IF(A1=C1,A1*10.6,0))

</PRE>The following Boolean formula also returns the correct results:
<P>
<PRE>   =((A1=B1)*A1*5.3)+((A1=C1)*A1*10.6)

</PRE>This example contains the basic pattern for emulating a nested IF()
statement, using a Boolean expression for each case. Each statement
that evaluates as "TRUE" will return the correct number; all others
will return a 0 (zero). The sum of the correct numbers and the zeros
will equal the sum of the correct number.
<P>
Boolean expressions can also be used in place of AND() and OR()
statements. For example:
<P>
<PRE>   =IF(AND(A1=B1,B1=C1),A1*5.3,0)
   =((A1=B1)*(B1=C1))*A1*5.3

   =IF(OR(A1=B1,B1=C1),A1*5.3,0)
   =((A1=B1)+(B1=C1))*A1*5.3

</PRE>Note: Boolean expressions evaluate more quickly than their standard
counterparts. This may make a difference on a large spreadsheet with
many nested calculations. Additionally, file space might be saved
because a Boolean expression is often shorter than its standard
counterpart.
