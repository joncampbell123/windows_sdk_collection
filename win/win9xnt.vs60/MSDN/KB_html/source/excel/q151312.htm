The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0c
</UL> 
<P>
SYMPTOMS
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel for Windows versions 5.0 and 5.0c, the Zoom property for
the PageSetup object may not scale worksheets correctly. The Scaling
setting may appear correctly in the Page Setup dialog box, but the actual
scaling of the sheet does not occur until you click OK interactively from
the Page Setup dialog box.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Zoom property may not be set correctly if the active printer is a
Postscript printer.
<P>
WORKAROUND
 
<P>
Using the Microsoft Excel 4.0 "PAGE.SETUP" macro function, you can set
the print scaling correctly for the worksheet. The following macro
demonstrates how to use this Microsoft Excel 4.0 macro function in a Visual
Basic for Applications procedure. The following procedure will set the
print scaling of the active worksheet at 25%.
<P>
Microsoft provides examples of Visual Basic for Applications procedures for
illustration only, without warranty either expressed or implied, including,
but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and/or fitness
for a particular purpose. The Visual Basic procedures in this article are
provided 'as is' and Microsoft does not guarantee that they can be used in
all situations. While Microsoft support engineers can help explain the
functionality of a particular macro, they will not modify these examples to
provide added functionality, nor will they help you construct macros to
meet your specific needs. If you have limited programming experience, you
may want to consult one of the Microsoft Solution Providers. Solution
Providers offer a wide range of fee-based services, including creating
custom macros. For more information about Microsoft Solution Providers,

<PRE>   Sub Print_Scale()
      Application.ExecuteExcel4Macro "PAGE.SETUP(,,,,,,,,,,,,25)"
   End Sub

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the versions of Microsoft
Excel mentioned at the beginning of this article. This problem no longer
occurs in Microsoft Excel for Windows 95 version 7.0.
<P>
MORE INFORMATION
 
<P>
Your worksheet may not fit exactly on the number of pages you want. You can
scale your printed work to fit on more or fewer pages than it would at
normal size, or you can specify a certain number of pages for your printed
worksheet. You can select both choices by clicking Page Setup on the File
menu and setting the scaling on the Page tab.
<P>
The Visual Basic property to set this is Zoom, and the Microsoft Excel 4.0
macro language command to set this is PAGE.SETUP. The Microsoft Excel 4.0
macro language commands can also be used in Visual Basic.
