The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0c
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, versions 7.0, 7.0a
<LI>Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, versions 5.0, 5.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, when you attempt to add a reference to an add-in 
(.XLA), you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Invalid Data Format

</PRE>In Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, you may see the following error 
message:
<P>
<PRE>   Error in Loading DLL

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
You receive this error message if you attempt to add a reference to an add-
in file that does not contain a Visual Basic module. If an add-in contains
only a Microsoft Excel 4.0 macro (such as ANALYSIS.XLA or Analysis 
Functions on the Macintosh),  it cannot be added as a reference.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
If you want to use a Microsoft Excel version 4.0 macro function that is
contained in a version 4.0 add-in (such as the Analysis ToolPak) in a
Visual Basic procedure, do either of the following:

<UL><LI>Use the Application.ExecuteExcel4Macro("string") method. The arguments
   for this method are the name and arguments of an Excel 4.0 macro
   function (without the equal sign).
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE>
<LI>If the function you want to use is included in a version 5.0 add-in
   (such as the Analysis ToolPak - VBA), either choose the References
   command from the Tools menu while you are in the Visual Basic module or
   add the add-in that contains the functions.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following examples show you how to use the two methods described above.
These examples demonstrate how to create a macro that displays the ANOVA
dialog box (an Analysis ToolPak macro).
<P>
<P><h3>Application.ExecuteExcel4Macro("string") Method</h3>
 
<P>
In order to run this macro, the version 4.0 add-in must be installed. To
install an add-in, choose Add-Ins from the Tools menu.

   ATPVBAEN.XLA (or Analysis ToolPak - VBA) is selected

<P><PRE>     Sub AnovaMacro2()

</PRE></OL>NOTE: When you use the second method, you use the same syntax as you would
in a Microsoft Excel 4.0-style macro, with one exception: instead of a
question mark, add a Q to the end of the name of the macro function.
