The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you open a Microsoft Excel workbook from Microsoft Windows Explorer,
the following error message appears
<P>
<PRE>   &lt;File name&gt; could not be found. Check the spelling of the file name, and
   verify that the file location is correct.

   If you are trying to open the file from your list of most recently used
   files on the File menu, make sure that the file has not been renamed,
   moved, or deleted.

</PRE>where &lt;File name&gt; is the name of the workbook you are attempting to open.
<P>
Subsequent error messages similar to this one may appear several times.
When you click OK, Microsoft Excel eventually opens the file.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when Microsoft Excel 97 and Microsoft Excel 4.0 are
both installed on the same computer and you attempt to open a workbook from
Windows Explorer.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, use one of the following methods.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1: Correct the Extensions Section</h3>
 
<P>
In method 1, locate the Win.ini file and correct the Extensions section. To
do this, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Save your work and close any programs that are running.

<P><LI>Click Start and click Run.

<P><LI>Type Win.ini and click OK.

<P><LI>In the Win.ini file that is displayed, click Find on the Search menu and
   find the Extensions section.

<P><LI>Type a semicolon (;) before each of the following lines:
<P>
<P><PRE>      xls=C:\EXCEL\Excel.EXE ^.xls
      xlc=C:\EXCEL\Excel.EXE ^.xlc
      xlw=C:\EXCEL\Excel.EXE ^.xlw
      xlm=C:\EXCEL\Excel.EXE ^.xlm
      xlt=C:\EXCEL\Excel.EXE ^.xlt
      xll=C:\EXCEL\Excel.EXE ^.xll
      xlb=C:\EXCEL\Excel.EXE ^.xlb
      xla=C:\EXCEL\Excel.EXE ^.xla
</PRE><P>
   Note that the path to the Excel.exe file on your computer may be
   different.

<P><LI>Save the file and close Notepad (or the text editor you are using).

<P><LI>Next, reinstall Microsoft Excel or Office by using the y and r Setup
   switches. To do this, follow these steps:
<P>
<P><PRE>    a. Click Start and click Run.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    b. In the open box, type the following
</PRE><P>
<PRE>          &lt;CD-ROM Drive&gt;:\Setup.exe /y /r

       where &lt;CD-ROM Drive&gt; is the letter of your CD-ROM drive.

</PRE></OL><h3>Method 2: Create a New Win.ini</h3>
 
<P>
If Method 1 does not resolve your problem, create a new Win.ini file.
<P>
NOTE: If you remove the Win.ini file, or if it becomes corrupted, and you
then restart Microsoft Windows 95, a new Win.ini is created. However, the
new Win.ini contains only the Desktop or Embedding sections. All other
sections are not included.
<P>
To create a new Win.ini file, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Use Windows Explorer to rename the Win.ini to Win.old. Then, reinstall
   Windows 95.
<P>
   Windows 95 detects that you are reinstalling, and a "Run Setup
   Again?" dialog box appears. The dialog box gives you two options.

<P><LI>Select the first option (to restore Windows files that are changed or
   corrupted) and reinstall Windows 95.
<P>
   This method recreates a new, complete Win.ini with all of the required
   sections.

<P><LI>Run the Setup program for Excel or Office. When you are prompted, click
   Reinstall.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you install or use Excel 4.0, entries are made to the Win.ini to
register the document types with Windows. The Windows 95 file types and
Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) registration entries are changed accordingly.
<P>
Excel 4.0 does not support long file names or spaces in a file name. A file
named "First Quarter.xls" that is located in the "My Documents" folder
generates the following error messages for each space in both the path and
the file name:
<P>
<PRE>   'C:\My.xls' could not be found. Check the spelling of the file name, and
   verify that the file location is correct.

</PRE></OL>This message is followed by
<P>
<PRE>   'C:\Documents\First.xls' could not be found. Check the spelling of
   the file name, and verify that the file location is correct.

</PRE>which is followed by
<P>
<PRE>   'C:\Quarter.xls' could not be found. Check the spelling of the file
   name, and verify that the file location is correct.
