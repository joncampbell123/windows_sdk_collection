The information in this article applies to:

<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition, if you use the File Conversion
Wizard to convert files from one format to another, you may receive the
following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Run-time error '424':
   Object required

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may occur if one or more of the files you are converting has a
name that uses the following convention
<P>
<PRE>   Workbook&lt;x&gt;

</PRE>where &lt;x&gt; is a number, for example, Workbook1, Workbook2, Workbook3, and so
on.
<P>
Specifically, the problem occurs because the File Conversion Wizard creates
a new workbook that contains the File Conversion Wizard Report. If the name
of this new workbook conflicts with the name of one of the files that you
are converting, you receive the error message.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, make sure that none of the files you convert
use the Workbook&lt;x&gt; format. To rename these files before you convert them,
use the Finder. For more information about the Finder, see your Macintosh
system documentation or the system Help file.
<P>
If this problem has already occurred, it is not necessary to run the File
Conversion Wizard again because the files have already been converted.
However, you may want to run the File Conversion Wizard because it does not
generate a report when the problem occurs.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The File Conversion Wizard is included in the Microsoft Office 98 Macintosh
Edition Value Pack. After you install the File Conversion Wizard, you can
use it by following these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, point to Wizard, and click File Conversion.

<P><LI>In the "File Conversion Wizard - Step 1 of 3" dialog box, specify the
   folder that contains the files you want to convert and select the kind
   of conversion you want to perform. (To specify a different folder, click
   Select.) Then, click Next.

<P><LI>In step 2 of the wizard, select the files that you want to convert.
   Or, click Select All to convert all files in the folder you specified.
   Then, click Next.

<P><LI>In step 3 of the wizard, specify the folder in which you want the
   wizard to place the converted files. Then, click Finish.
<P>
</OL>When you click Finish, the File Conversion Wizard converts the files and
uses the folders and file names you specified. When the wizard converts all
the files you selected, it generates a File Conversion Wizard Report.
However, if the name of one of the converted files is in the Workbook&lt;x&gt;
format, the report may not appear, and you may receive the error message in
the "Symptoms" section in this article.
