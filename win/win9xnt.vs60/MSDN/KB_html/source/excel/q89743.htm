<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When using Save As from the File menu in Microsoft Excel to save a new
copy of a workbook document, the original document name is not
maintained in the workbook. The original document remains, however,
with the new name.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Sometimes it may be necessary to save another copy of a document
already in the workbook back to the workbook with another name. Using
the Save As command from the File menu changes the name of the
document, but does not retain the copy of the document with the
original name.
<P>
<P><h3>To Save a Workbook Document to Another Name</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Open the workbook and choose the Contents button at the bottom of
   the workbook window.

<P><LI>Select the document that needs to be saved back with a different
   name.

<P><LI>If the document is bound, change the document to Unbound, activate
   it, and save the document by choosing File Save. Choose the Contents
   button.

<P><LI>Select the document that needs to be saved back with a different
   name, choose the Options button at the bottom of the workbook window
   and change the name of the document to the new name desired.

<P><LI>Choose the Add button at the bottom of the workbook window.

<P><LI>From the Add dialog box, choose Open and select the original
   document, then choose OK.

<P><LI>Select the original document name (which now should be in the
   workbook as bound).
<P>
</OL>If the documents need to be unbound, choose the Options button at the
bottom of the workbook window and change "Store document in" to
"Separate file" and delete the unbound copy by choosing Delete from
the File menu and selecting the file.
