<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Internet Assistant for Microsoft Excel, also known as the Hypertext
Markup Language (HTML) Wizard, is another in a series of add-on Wizards
that Microsoft is making available to enhance your use of Microsoft Excel.
The Internet Assistant for Microsoft Excel helps you to convert Excel
tables into HTML tables in either a separate HTML file or as an insert in
an existing HTML template file.
<P>
The add-in discussed in this article is provided "as is" and Microsoft does
not guarantee that it can be used in all situations. Although Microsoft
support engineers can help with the installation and existing functionality
of this add-in, they will not modify the add-in to provide new
functionality.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Internet Assistant Wizard (HTML Wizard) converts Microsoft Excel
data into a HTML table. This is a great way to get started with HTML
programming because the Wizard does all the work. Below is a detailed
description of each step in the Wizard, followed by an example.
<P>
<P><h3>Step 1 of the Wizard</h3>
 
<P>
In this step, you specify the range of cells that contain the data you want
to convert. As with most of the Microsoft Excel add-ins, the dialog box
opens with the range box filled in. Microsoft Excel (version 5.0 and later)
is designed to determine where the list is. If the range is not filled in
correctly, you must change it manually either by using the mouse pointer to
select the correct range or by typing the correct range.
<P>
<P><h3>Step 2 of the Wizard</h3>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Excel data can be converted in two different ways. In this
step of the wizard, you can select options to do either of the following:

<UL><LI>You can create an independent, ready to view HTML document that contains
   the formatted data. This process creates the header, table, and footer.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE>
<LI>You can copy the converted table to your existing HTML template. This
   process creates only the table.
<P>
</UL><h3>Step 3 of the Wizard</h3>
 
<P>
Depending on which option you select in step 2 of the wizard, the
information that you must provide in this step varies. Do either of
the following:

<UL><LI>If you chose the first option in step 2 of the wizard, this step (step
   3) prompts you for the header and footer information. The wizard does
   not prompt you to enter anything for the table section because that
   information is taken directly from the data.
<P>
   The Header information includes the following: title, header,
   description text, and insertion of a horizontal line before the table.
<P>
   The Footer information includes the following: last update (current date
   is entered by default), name, e-mail name, and insertion of a horizontal
   line after the table.

<LI>If you chose the second option in step 2 of the wizard, this step (step
   3) prompts you for the path and file name for the HTML template in which
   you want the table to be inserted. You can type the path, or you can
   browse for it. The HTML template must contain the string "##TABLE##"
   (without the quotation marks). The table is inserted into the HTML
   template after the string.
<P>
</UL><h3>Step 4 of the Wizard</h3>
 
<P>
In this step, the wizard can convert the table with or without the
formatting.
<P>
<P><h3>Step 5 of the Wizard</h3>
 
<P>
In this step, you provide or browse for the path and file name that you
want to save to.
<P>
