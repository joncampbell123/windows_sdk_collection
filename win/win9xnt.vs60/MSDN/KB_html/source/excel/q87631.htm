<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Below is the contents of the QEREADME.TXT, which is located in the
EXCEL subdirectory after installation. The text describes various
considerations for the installation and usage of Q+E. The last section
contains information regarding documentation errors.
<P>
<P><h3>Notes on using Q+E for Microsoft Excel</h3>
 
<P>
Contents
<PRE>   Outdated Driver Files
   QE.EXE
     dBASE IV Compatibility
   QE.XLA
      Command Equivalent Functions
      SQL Query Command
      Text Files
      "Remote Links Exist" message
   Errata: Q+E for Microsoft Excel User's Guide

</PRE><h3>Outdated Driver Files</h3>
 
<P>
If you previously installed a version of Q+E earlier than version
3.0a, the following driver files will have been copied to your Windows
\SYSTEM directory: QEDBF.DLL, QESS.DLL, QEXLS.DLL, QETXT.DLL and
QEXLA.DLL. Q+E versions 3.0a and later install new versions of these
files in the directory containing EXCEL.EXE. When you install Q+E with
Excel, Setup adds the Excel directory to the Path command in your
AUTOEXEC.BAT file so that, after restarting your computer, Q+E will
find the new drivers instead of the older versions. If you install Q+E
separately from Excel, or choose not have Setup modify your
AUTOEXEC.BAT file, Q+E will not find the new drivers and you will
receive the following message:
<P>
<PRE>  The DLL for this source is out of date. Reinstall the driver
  or remove the directory containing the old DLL from your path.

</PRE>The name of the driver will also be displayed in the error message. If
this occurs, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Remove the following files from your Windows \SYSTEM directory:
   QEDBF.DLL QESS.DLL QEXLS.DLL QETXT.DLL

<P><LI>Add the directory containing Q+E to the Path command in your
   AUTOEXEC.BAT file.
<P>
</OL><h3>QE.EXE</h3>
 
<P>
<P><h3>dBASE IV Compatibility</h3>
 
<P>
By default, Q+E operates on dBASE files according to dBASE IV
compatibility. For most uses, ANSI compatibility provides more
predictable results in terms of handling the sorting, averaging,
counting, and displaying of Null values. Also, using UPPER and LOWER
functions according to dBASE IV compatibility does not change the case
of international characters. To change your compatibility default to
ANSI, select Options in the dBASEFile Open dialog, select ANSI as the
compatibility, and choose OK with the Set Default checkbox selected.
<P>
For a more thorough explanation of the differences between dBASE IV
SQL and ANSI SQL, refer to Appendix A, "Using Q+E with dBASE", in your
"Q+E for Microsoft Excel User's Guide."
<P>
Changing or adding records in the Q+E Data Form dialog will not update
or insert new records until you move to the next record or exit Data
Form.
<P>
If you will be exchanging text files between Q+E and Microsoft Excel,
be sure to save them with a tab separator and a .TXT extension. If you
are saving the file as a .CSV file, be sure to use the separator
indicated in your Microsoft Windows Control Panel.
<P>
Field Names from Microsoft Excel Documents
 
<P>
Q+E encloses field names from Microsoft Excel documents that contain
spaces or lowercase letters with the ` character. To avoid possible
conflicts with extracting data to Microsoft Excel, or specifying
criteria, use only uppercase characters in your ExcelFile database
tables, and use underscore characters instead of spaces.
<P>
Note: It is recommended that you do not execute database functions
while in workgroup mode.
<P>
<P><h3>QE.XLA</h3>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Command Equivalent Functions</h3>
 
<P>
Many of the command equivalent functions in QE.XLA turn off error
checking at run time. If you use QE.XLA command equivalents and error
checking in a macro, insert ERROR(TRUE) following the QE.XLA command
equivalent to turn error checking back on.
<P>
<P><h3>SQL Query Command</h3>
 
<P>
QE.XLA provides a SQL Query command for sending SQL statements
directly to Q+E. When using this command, include the source name in
the table specification of the FROM line. This tells Q+E which source
to use in opening the file.
<P>
For example, "SELECT * FROM dBASEFILE|C:\emp.dbf" selects all the
records from the dBASE file named "emp.dbf", located in the root
directory. If you will be saving queries from the SQL Query dialog to
be opened by Q+E, include the Q+E headerline "Q+E 3.0 for sourcename"
as the first line in the statement, where sourcename is the name of
the source for Q+E to use in executing the specified query.
<P>
SQL Query allows you to run just a portion of the text in the SQL
Query dialog by selecting that text prior to choosing Run. If no text
is selected, SQL Query sends the entire statement to Q+E.
<P>
<P><h3>Text Files</h3>
 
<P>
By default, all fields in a textfile database table will be read as
character fields. To extract formatted data, or do extracts on data
such as dates or numeric values, select the "Guess Data Types" option
in the Q+E Open Textfile Options dialog and select the Set Default
checkbox. Fixed Length Files will always be read by QE.XLA as a single
column of data. For best results, open the Fixed Length file first in
Q+E or Microsoft Excel, parse the information into columns, and save
it as a character-delimited file.
<P>
<P><h3>"Remote Links Exist" Message</h3>
 
<P>
Closing a file after extracting information from an external database
displays the message:
<P>
<PRE>   Remote links to document exist. Close anyway?

</PRE></OL>This message is advising you that a connection has been made between
the document and Q+E to exchange information. Choose OK to proceed
with closing the file.
<P>

<P>
Chapter:  9, Using Microsoft Excel to Access Data on External Databases
<P>
Section:  Using Macro Functions with Q+E
Function: DB.DELETE
<PRE>          Page 68:
          The heading shows only the question form of the function.
          There is a standard form as well. Also, change DB.DELETE?()
          to DB.DELETE() -- no question mark in the second-to-last line
          in the paragraph below the heading.
</PRE>Function: DB.PASTE.FIELDNAMES
<PRE>          Page 71:
          The second argument should read "paste_fields," not
          "fieldname." Also, when using this function, use one or the
          other argument (or neither), but not both.
