The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0c
<LI>Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, versions 5.0, 5.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the Find File command in Microsoft Excel or on the Microsoft
Office menu to view a preview of a Microsoft Excel workbook, the preview
window may display the message, "No preview is available for this file."
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Excel Help information for the Find File Command states that
the Preview option will display a picture of the active sheet in a
workbook. This information in Help is incorrect: the preview will display a
picture of the first sheet in a workbook only if all of the following
conditions are true:

<UL><LI>The file you are viewing is a Microsoft Excel version 5.0 workbook
<P>
<P><PRE>    -and-
</PRE>
<LI>The first sheet in the workbook is a worksheet, chart sheet, or
   Microsoft Excel 4.0 macro sheet.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -and-
</PRE>
<LI>The file was saved with summary information
<P>
</UL><h3>Created in Microsoft Excel Versions Earlier Than 5.0</h3>
 
<P>
When you save a file in Microsoft Excel Workbook format, a preview of the
upper-left corner of the active sheet is saved with it. This preview, also
known as a thumbnail, is what is displayed when you use the preview feature
of the Find File command. You will not be able to preview files created in
versions of Microsoft Excel earlier than version 5.0, because there is no
thumbnail contained with these files. Instead, the preview window will
display the message, "No preview is available for this file."
<P>
<P><h3>Module Sheet or Dialog Sheet</h3>
 
<P>
The Find File command in Microsoft Excel version 5.0 will not display a
preview of a workbook if the first sheet in the workbook is either a Visual
Basic module or a dialog sheet. A preview of a workbook, also known as a
thumbnail, is only available if the first sheet in the workbook is a
worksheet, chart, or MS Excel 4.0 macro sheet.
<P>
<P><h3>Summary Information</h3>
 
<P>
You cannot display a preview for a Microsoft Excel workbook if the Prompt
For Summary Info check box (on the General tab in the Options dialog box)
is not selected when you save the workbook. A workbook file must be saved
with summary information in order to view a preview of this file in Find
File.
<P>
Note that you can view a preview of a Microsoft Excel workbook in Microsoft
Word version 6.0 using the Find File command even if the conditions
described above are not true.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
To view a preview of a Microsoft Excel workbook in Find File, do the
following:

<OL><P><LI>If the file was created in a version of Microsoft Excel earlier than
   version 5.0, save the file in the Microsoft Excel version 5.0 format by
   using the following steps:
