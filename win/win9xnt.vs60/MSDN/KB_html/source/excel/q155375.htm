The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you try to maneuver or position an AutoShape object, the Free Rotate
toolbar button, and the "Rotate or Flip" and Nudge commands on the Draw
menu may be disabled.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
If you are working with an AutoShape object and you are in Edit mode
(cursor is blinking within the object), the Free Rotate toolbar button and
the "Rotate or Flip" and Nudge commands on the Draw menu will be disabled.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To be able to change the orientation of an AutoShape, you must not be in
Edit mode, but the object still must be selected. Note that if the cursor 
is blinking within an AutoShape, you are in Edit mode. To be able to select 
an AutoShape object without going into Edit mode, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>If you are currently in Edit mode, click any cell within your
   worksheet.

<P><LI>Place your mouse pointer on the border of the object, and click
   once to select the object.
<P>
   The Free Rotate toolbar button and the "Rotate or Flip" and Nudge
   commands on the Draw menu will now be available.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you rotate or flip an AutoShape object that already contains text, the
text will not rotate or flip with the object. Also, some objects that you
import into Microsoft Excel cannot be rotated or flipped. This is because
they were not created within Microsoft Excel. You also cannot rotate or
flip bitmaps that are pasted into your worksheet.
<P>
<P><h2>REFERENCES</h2>
 
<P>
For more information about rotating objects, click the Index tab in
Microsoft Excel Help, type the following text
<P>

</PRE></OL>and then double-click the selected text to go to the "Rotate or flip
drawing object" topic.
