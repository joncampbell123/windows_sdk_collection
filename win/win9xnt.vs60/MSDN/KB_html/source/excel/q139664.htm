The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, version 5.0a
<LI>Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh to open a file that was
created and saved in Microsoft Excel 7.0 for Windows or Microsoft Excel 97,
you cannot open the file, and the following error message appears:
<P>
<PRE>   Cannot find '&lt;filename&gt;'

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
If you save a file from a program that runs under Microsoft Windows 95 to
an unlabeled disk, a disk label (volume label) is created on that disk.
This label is visible on the Macintosh when you insert the disk in the
Macintosh disk drive.
<P>
The disk label consists of the drive letter (for example "A") followed by
the first five characters of the file name. This disk label prevents you
from opening the file when you attempt to open it from the disk by clicking
Open on the File menu in Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh.
<P>
NOTE: A Macintosh computer can automatically read an MS-DOS disk (a PC
disk) if AccessPC or PCExchange is installed and running.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, do either of the following:

<UL><LI>Rename the disk on the Macintosh. To do this, click the name of the
   disk on the desktop, press DELETE, and type a new name for the disk.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE>
<LI>Copy the file that you want to open from the MS-DOS disk to the hard
   disk on the Macintosh, and then open the file from the hard disk.
<P>
</UL>NOTE: If the disk is formatted in Windows 95 so that it already has a disk
label when you save the file to it, the Save As command does not create a
disk label and this problem does not occur.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This problem has been fixed by Apple with PC Exchange 2.2 that ships with
Macintosh OS 8.1.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Programs that run under Windows 95 (including Microsoft Excel, Microsoft
Word, WordPad, and Notepad) create a volume name, or label, on a floppy
disk if the disk doesn't have a volume name when you save a file to it.
This name is not apparent in Microsoft Windows Explorer (which displays the
volume name as blank). However, when you use the disk on a Macintosh
computer, the floppy drive letter, for example "A," plus the first five
characters in the file name are used as the disk name (instead of the
"Untitled" disk label).
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Excel Version 5.0c</h3>
 
<P>
This problem does not occur when you open files that were saved in
Microsoft Excel 5.0c running under Windows 95.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Excel Version 7.0</h3>
 
<P>
If a file is saved in Microsoft Excel 7.0 with a file type of "Microsoft
Excel 4.0 Worksheet," you can open the file in Microsoft Excel 4.0 for the
Macintosh. However, you cannot open the file in Microsoft Excel 5.0 for
the Macintosh. Note that files saved after the first file on the floppy
disk do not affect the volume name. However, you cannot open these files.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Excel 97</h3>
 
<P>
If you save a file in Microsoft Excel 97 in the Microsoft Excel 97 file
format to an untitled floppy disk, the disk label is created as described
earlier in this article. However, the workarounds in this article do not
allow you to open the file because Microsoft Excel 5.0 for the Macintosh
cannot read the Microsoft Excel 97 file format. To open a file created in
Microsoft Excel 97 in Microsoft Excel 5.0 for the Macintosh, follow these
steps in Microsoft Excel 97:

<OL><P><LI>On the File menu, click Save As.

<P><LI>In the Save As dialog box, click "Microsoft Excel 5.0/95 Workbook
   (*.xls)" in the Save As Type list, and then click Save.
<P>
</OL>When you try to open this file in Microsoft Excel 5.0 for the Macintosh,
you may receive the error message mentioned in the "Symptoms" section, but
the workarounds listed in this article allow you to open the file.
