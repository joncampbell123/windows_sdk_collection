                                  =======

</PRE>This article contains troubleshooting steps you can use to resolve problems
that may occur when you import accounting data from QuickBooks for Windows,
version 5.0, into the Small Business Accounting Manager 97 for Microsoft

                             ================

</PRE><h2>FILTER DOES NOT RECOGNIZE THE ACCOUNTING FILE</h2>
 
<P>
If the accounting file you want to import does not appear in step 3 of the
Import Wizard, verify the information in the following sections.
<P>
<P><h3>Determine Which Version of QuickBooks You Are Using</h3>
 
<P>
The Small Business Financial Manager filter is written for a specific
version of QuickBooks. The current filter for QuickBooks 5.0 supports
releases 1 through 4. To determine the specific version of QuickBooks you
are using, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Start menu, click Programs, and then click Windows Explorer or
   Windows NT Explorer.

<P><LI>Open the folder in which QuickBooks is installed. Right-click the
   QuickBooks program file, Qbw.exe, and then click Properties.

<P><LI>In the Qbw Properties dialog box, click the Version tab.
<P>
   NOTE: If you have question about your version of QuickBooks, contact
   Intuit technical support.
<P>
   For information about how to contact Intuit, query in the Knowledge Base
   for one of the following articles:

</PRE></OL><h3>Verify That You Are Selecting the Correct Folder</h3>
 
<P>
To verify that you are selecting the correct folder or folder level for the
QuickBooks accounting data file, follow the steps in the next two sections.
<P>
Searching the Entire Computer for the File:
<P>
To search the computer, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click Import Wizard on the Accounting menu and click Next. In step 2 of
   the "Import your Accounting Data" dialog box, click "Look on My
   Computer."
<P>
   By clicking "Look on My Computer" you are specifying that you want to
   search all hard disks that are attached to the computer.

<P><LI>Click Next to go to step 3 of the wizard.
<P>
   The file that contains the accounting data you want to import should
   appear in the list of files to import.
<P>
</OL>Searching Specific Folders for the File:
<P>
To search specific folders, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>To specify the hard disk and folder in which to search, click "In
   specific folders" in step 2 of the "Import your Accounting Data" dialog
   box. Under "In specific folders," click the hard disk drive letter for
   the disk that contains the accounting file.

<P><LI>To select a folder, click the folder in the list. To select a subfolder,
   double-click the parent folder in the list, and then click the
   subfolder. After you select the folder that contains the accounting
   data, click "Add folder to list."

<P><LI>Click Next to go to step 3.
<P>
   The accounting data should appear in the list of files to import.
<P>
</OL>WHILE YOU IMPORT DATA, THE PROGRAM STOPS
<P><h3>RESPONDING OR AN ERROR MESSAGE APPEARS</h3>
 
<P>
Determine whether the words "Stopped responding" appear next to Microsoft
Excel or QuickBooks in the Microsoft Windows Close Program dialog box. To
display the Close Program dialog box, press CTRL+ALT+DEL one time only. If
the words "Stopped responding" appear next to Microsoft Excel or QuickBooks
in the dialog box, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>In the Close Program dialog box, click Microsoft Excel or QuickBooks and
   click End Task.
<P>
   If an error message subsequently appears, click End until the program
   quits.

<P><LI>After you close Excel or QuickBooks, open the Small Business Financial
   Manager Database folder and delete any files that end with a .tmp file
   name extension.
<P>
   This folder is located by default in the following location:
<P>
<P><PRE>      C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\SBFM\Database
</PRE>
<P><LI>Start the QuickBooks accounting program and do the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Determine whether QuickBooks is registered.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      For Excel to import the accounting data, QuickBooks must be
      installed on the computer and QuickBooks must be registered with
      Inuit. This is necessary because the Small Business Financial Manager
      exports the accounting transactions by communicating with QuickBooks
      through dynamic data exchange (DDE). When QuickBooks is not
      registered, dialog boxes appear and interfere with the DDE channel
      between Excel and QuickBooks.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - Determine whether the file uses a password.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      Remove all passwords in the QuickBooks accounting file. To remove
      passwords, click Passwords on the File menu. In the Passwords dialog
      box, click Clear Password for each category.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - Determine whether memorized transactions are entered.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      Before you import the accounting data, run (enter) all memorized
      transactions.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      To determine if the accounting file contains memorized
      transactions, click Memorized Transactions on the Lists menu. If
      information appears in the Memorized Transaction List dialog box,
      transactions have been recorded.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      To run memorized transactions, click the transaction you want to run,
      and then click Enter Transaction.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      NOTE: To delete a memorized transaction, click the transaction you
      want to delete, click Memorized Transaction, and then click Delete.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - Determine Whether Reminders Are Active.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      Before you import accounting data, make all reminders unavailable. To
      make reminders unavailable, follow these steps:
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       a. On the File menu, click Preferences. In the window to the left
<PRE></PRE>          of the Reminders dialog box, click Reminders.

       b. For each option in the Reminders dialog box, click Don't Remind
          Me.

    - Determine whether a transaction should be closed.

      QuickBooks accounting allows you to keep a transaction open over
      different accounting periods. Although QuickBooks allows this
      behavior, it is considered unconventional by most accounting
      programs and causes the Small Business Financial Manager filter to
      stop responding. Verify that no transactions with a date that is 12
      months prior to the current date are open.

      For example, if the current date is in October 1997, and the
      accounting year is based on a calendar year, close all transactions
      for the entire January to December 1996 period.

      To check the Closed Transactions date, follow these steps:

       a. On the File menu, click Passwords.

       b. Look under Transaction Password in the Passwords dialog box.

          The "Date through which books are closed" box indicates the date
          for which a transaction is closed. This date must not be greater
          than 12 months before the current date.

</PRE></OL><h2>THE PROCESS OF IMPORTING DATA IS SLOW</h2>
 
<P>
The time that is required for Small Business Financial Manager to import
QuickBooks accounting data is proportional to the number of accounts that
contain transactions and the total number of transactions in the file.
Because the Small Business Financial Manager exports the accounting
transactions by communicating with QuickBooks through DDE, the time that is
required may range from a few minutes to several hours.
<P>
When you import data from QuickBooks into Excel by using the Small Business
Financial Manager, the data is exported from QuickBooks to a temporary file
as text. Then the data is inserted into a Microsoft Access database file.
This process may also require a considerable amount of time depending on
the number of transactions and the number of accounts to process.
<P>
<P><h2>USER INPUT IS NOT AVAILABLE WHILE IMPORTING</h2>
 
<P>
Because the Small Business Financial Manager exports the accounting
transactions by communicating with QuickBooks through DDE, you cannot
interact with the program. This includes mouse movement and keyboard input.
<P>
<P><h2>ERRORS APPEAR AFTER IMPORTING</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the Small Business Financial manager to analyze or update
data, you may receive an error message. For more information about error
messages that may appear when you use the add-in, query on the following
words here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
