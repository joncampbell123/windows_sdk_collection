The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, versions 7.0, 7.0a
<LI>Microsoft Office for Windows 95, versions 7.0, 7.0a
<LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows

</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run Microsoft Excel 7.0 or Microsoft Excel 97, you may receive one
or more of the following error messages:
<P>
<PRE>   Out of memory.

    -or-

   Not enough memory to display completely.

    -or-

   Your file could not be printed due to an error on &lt;printer name&gt;.

    -or-

   This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down.
   If the problem persists, contact the program vendor.

   If you click Details, you receive an error message that is similar to
   the following:

      EXCEL caused an invalid page fault in module MSO97.DLL at
      &lt;address&gt;.

</PRE>In addition, the amount of available random access memory in your System
and graphics device interface (GDI) memory heaps may drop to a very low
level (10 percent or less).
<P>
These problems may also occur in Microsoft Word 97, Microsoft PowerPoint
97, and Microsoft Outlook 97, especially when you use Microsoft Word as
your e-mail editor.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
These problems may occur if the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>A printer driver for any of the following printers is installed on your
   computer:
<P>
<P><PRE>      HP DeskJet 660C
      HP DeskJet 672c
      HP DeskJet 680C
      HP DeskJet 694C
      HP DeskJet 820
      HP DeskJet 820C
      HP DeskJet 820CSE
      HP DeskJet 870Cse
      HP DeskJet 870Cxi
      HP LaserJet 6P
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       -and-
</PRE>
<LI>One of these printers is the default printer.
<P>
</UL><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
You may be able to reduce the effects of this problem by doing one of the
following:

<UL><LI>It is possible that using an earlier version of the printer driver will
   correct the problem; however, this has not been confirmed by Microsoft.

<LI>It is also possible that the latest version of the printer driver will
   correct the problem.  The latest versions of the printer drivers can be
   downloaded from the following Hewlett-Packard Internet web site:

<LI>Before you start Microsoft Excel or any other program in which
   the problem may occur, set the default printer to a printer that is
   different from the printers listed in this article.

<LI>If you must use one of the printers listed in this article, do not print
   or view the document in print preview unless it is necessary. Every time
   you use the printer driver more memory is lost in your System and
   graphics device interface (GDI) memory heaps.

<LI>Save your work often.

<LI>If you start to encounter problems that are related to memory, save your
   work, quit all open programs, and then restart your computer.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The printers listed in this article do not contain their own memory;
instead, the printer drivers are designed to use the computer memory when
rendering and processing print jobs.
