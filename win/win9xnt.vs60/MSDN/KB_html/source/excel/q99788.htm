The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 4.0, 4.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you load add-in macros in Microsoft Excel by specifying an OPENn=
statement in the EXCEL4.INI file (where n is a number that specifies
the order in which the add-in is to be opened), the macro may not be
loaded if one number in the OPEN= sequence is missing.
<P>
This is by design of Microsoft Excel.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Each OPEN= statement, except the first, is followed by a numeric value
(that is, OPEN=, OPEN1=, OPEN2=, and so on). For example, if the
OPEN1= statement is missing from the sequence, the next add-in in the
sequence, OPEN2=, will not be loaded when you start Microsoft Excel.
<P>
As long as each number is represented in the sequence, the OPEN=
statements can be in any order in the EXCEL4.INI file.
<P>
Some add-in macros may appear to load even though they are out of
sequence. This may occur because they are entered in the Init Commands
section of the EXCEL4.INI file. The Init Commands section places
entries in the menu when Microsoft Excel is started. The Add-in
Manager creates entries in the Init Commands section if the add-in
macro contains the defined name with "__Command" (without the
quotation marks). For further information on this defined name, query
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base using the following words:
<P>
<PRE>   "init" and "open=" and "add-in" and "demandload" and "manager"

</PRE>and choose the article entitled "Controlling how Add-ins Load Upon
Startup."
<P>
The Add-in Manager does not check to see which add-in macros are
actually in memory; instead, it checks the OPEN= statements in the
[Microsoft Excel] section, and all entries in the [Init Commands]
section of the EXCEL4.INI.
