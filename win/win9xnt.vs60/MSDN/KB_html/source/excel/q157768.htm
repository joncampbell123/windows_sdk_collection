The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT, versions 3.51, 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you start Microsoft Excel 97, some menu items are not displayed.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This may occur if the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>You are not logged on the computer as the user who originally
   installed Microsoft Excel 97 (either as an individual program or
   or as part of Microsoft Office 97) on this computer.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -and-
</PRE>
<LI>The computer is running Windows NT, version 3.51 or 4.0, or it is
   running Windows 95 with User Profiles turned on.
<P>
</UL>For example, if user "JoeTech" installs Microsoft Excel 97 on this computer
and you log on as user "JaneTech", certain menu items, such as "Save as
HTML" (on the File menu) and "Report Manager" (on the View menu), may not
appear.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To add menu items, you must activate the add-ins that provide the missing
menu items. To do this:

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Add-Ins.

<P><LI>In the list of available Add-Ins, select the check box to the left
   of each add-in whose menu item is not displayed:
<P>
<PRE>                                   Menu                 Sub Menu
Add-In                     Menu    Item                 Item
</PRE></OL>

</PRE><P><LI>Once the add-ins are selected, click OK to close the dialog box.
<P>
</OL>Each user who logs on this computer may need to repeat these steps the
first time they log on and use Microsoft Excel.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design of Microsoft Excel 97.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you install Microsoft Excel 97 on your computer, if you choose to
install any add-ins, they are copied onto your computer and are available
for everyone to use.
<P>
However, if your computer is running Windows NT or is configured to use
User Profiles under Windows 95, Microsoft Excel 97 stores add-in settings
for each user separately. Because of this, only the user who installed
Microsoft Excel 97 will have add-ins turned on by default. Other users who
log in to the computer and run Microsoft Excel 97 may find that not all 
add-
ins are turned on.
<P>
For example: if user "JoeTech" installs Microsoft Excel 97 and chooses to
install add-ins, the Setup program will copy the add-ins onto the computer
and turn on the add-ins for JoeTech. If user "JaneTech" logs on the
computer, she initially has no settings for Microsoft Excel 97. So, when
she first runs Microsoft Excel 97, not all of the add-ins will load.
<P>
Follow the steps shown in the workaround section to eliminate this problem
for the current user.
<P>
To turn User Profiles on in Windows 95:

<OL><P><LI>On the Start menu, point to Settings and click Control Panel.

<P><LI>Double-click Passwords. Click the User Profiles tab.

<P><LI>Click "Users can customize...". Select both check boxes. Click OK.
<P></OL>
