The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In the versions of Microsoft Excel listed at the beginning of this article,
if you select a cell that is "behind" a drawing object or AutoShape, the
cell selection cursor may not be displayed correctly or may not be
displayed at all. Also, if you make changes to any of the cells behind the
AutoShape, the screen may not be redrawn correctly.
<P>
As a result, it may be difficult for you to determine which cell is
selected or to drag or fill cells behind the AutoShape.
<P>
NOTE: The cell selection cursor is the thick border that surrounds the
selected cell in a worksheet. Usually, a small square called a fill handle
is displayed at the lower-right corner of the cell selection cursor.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
These problems occur if the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>The AutoShape is formatted to use no fill (it is transparent).
<P>
<P><PRE>    -and-
</PRE>
<LI>The AutoShape is formatted to use a dashed line of one of the
   following types:
<P>
<PRE>      Dash        Long Dash Dot
      Dash Dot    Long Dash Dot Dot
      Long Dash

</PRE></UL>NOTE: This problem does not occur in earlier versions of Microsoft Excel.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around these problem, format the AutoShape to use one of the
following dashed line types:
<P>
<PRE>   Solid
   Round Dot
   Square Dot

</PRE>To do this, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>In the worksheet, right-click the border of the AutoShape. On the
   shortcut menu, click Format AutoShape.

<P><LI>Click the Colors And Lines tab.

<P><LI>In the Dashed list box, select one of the first three items (Solid,
   Round Dot, or Square Dot).

<P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
</OL>If you cannot change the formatting of your AutoShape, you can still
determine which cell that is behind the AutoShape is selected by looking in
the Name box, which is located to the left of the Formula Bar and just
below the File menu.
<P>
Note that the mouse pointer will still behave correctly when you move it
over the cells behind the AutoShape. Because of this, it is still possible
to drag or fill cells behind the AutoShape, as long as you know what cells
are selected and you know what the various pointer shapes mean. For
example, if the pointer is a small plus sign, the pointer is over the lower-
right corner of the selected cell, so you can fill the cell.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
