The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you enter a sentence in a cell, AutoCorrect may not capitalize the first
word in the sentence. This behavior may occur even if you have "Capitalize
first letter of sentence" checked in the AutoCorrect dialog box.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
You may experience this problem if you enter a single sentence in a cell
and the first letter of the first word is not capitalized. The AutoCorrect
feature only capitalizes the first letter in the first word of a sentence
if you precede this word with a period followed by a space. Note, if you
type multiple sentences in a cell, the first words in the second and
subsequent sentences are capitalized by the AutoCorrect feature if you end
the first and subsequent sentences with a period and a space.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
There is no resolution to this problem. The first word of the first
sentence of one or more sentences in a cell are not capitalized by the
AutoCorrect feature. To capitalize the first word of the first sentence,
you must edit the sentence in the cell.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The AutoCorrect feature in Microsoft Excel corrects text automatically as
you type. It offers the ability to correct the following situations:

<UL><LI>words that begin with two capital letters
<LI>correct sentences where the first word is not capitalized
<LI>correct days of the week that are not capitalized
<LI>correct accidental use of the CAPS key
<LI>correct words that you commonly misspell
<P>
</UL>Each of these options can be turned on or off in the AutoCorrect dialog
box. To display the AutoCorrect dialog box, click AutoCorrect on the Tools
menu.
