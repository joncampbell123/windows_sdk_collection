</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the Compose New Fax Wizard and attach a Microsoft Excel
spreadsheet, you receive an email message from the System Administrator
with the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Your message did not reach some or all of the intended recipients.

     Subject       &lt;subject&gt;
     Sent          &lt;date and time&gt;

   The following recipient(s) could not be reached.

   '&lt;addressee&gt;' on &lt;date and time&gt;
      Couldn't prepare the message in the allotted time.
      Try again and make certain to respond to any application dialogs.
      If this doesn't work, open the file and print it to the Microsoft Fax
      printer.

</PRE>In addition, the Compose New Fax Wizard is restarted. Upon reentering the
pertinent information, the fax is sent successfully.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
In the Microsoft Excel Print dialog box, you have chosen to print to the
Microsoft Fax device instead of to the Rendering Subsystem.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the Compose New Fax Wizard and attach a Microsoft Excel
spreadsheet, choose to print to the Rendering Subsystem in the Microsoft
Excel Print dialog box.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Excel for Windows
95, version 7.0. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If the fax capabilities of the recipient are unknown and Microsoft Fax is
not specifically set as Editable Only, Microsoft Fax will render the
document into the standard Group 3 image format (among other formats). In
order to render the document, the host application must be started to print
to the rendering subsystem.
<P>
With most applications this process requires no user intervention. However,
when using Microsoft Excel, the faxing/rendering process stops at the
Microsoft Excel Print dialog box, awaiting input from the user. If the user
clicks OK, accepting the default of Rendering Subsystem as the print
device, the faxing process will proceed normally. However, if the user
chooses the Microsoft Fax as the print device, Microsoft Excel attempts to
re-render the fax, in essence creating two fax jobs. The first job fails
and returns the error message. The second process re-renders the fax and
spools it to the fax device. Because of this, the Compose New Fax Wizard
appears again.
<P>
The Microsoft Fax print device is to be used when sending a fax from
Microsoft Excel using the File Print option.
