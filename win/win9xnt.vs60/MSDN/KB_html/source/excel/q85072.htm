<PRE>             Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, Version 4.0
               Automated Product Support Service Fax-Script
                      Questions and Answers: Printing
             -----------------------------------------------

1. Q. When I choose Page Setup, certain options are grayed or
      unavailable. How can I access these features?

   A. A commonly requested feature for Excel version 3.0 was the
      ability to use Reduce or Enlarge for any printer, and a
      fit-to-page option. Excel 4.0 now supports these scaling
      features for all printers. Other document setting options may,
      however, not be available.

      If certain options are grayed or unavailable, then the currently
      selected printer driver doesn't support these extended options,
      or Excel has a way of implementing the option that is more
      flexible. For example, many printers allow only a few reduction
      options, such as 100 percent and 50 percent. Using Excel 4.0's
      new Reduce or Enlarge feature in Page Setup, you can select any
      percentage, including 100 percent and 50 percent. This allows
      you more flexibility in your work, so Excel asks the printer
      driver to gray, or make unavailable, its options in favor of
      Excel's.

2. Q. I understand that a new feature in Excel 4.0 is the ability to
      create multiple-line headers and footers. How can I do this?

   A. The creation and modification of headers and footers in Excel
      4.0 has been greatly simplified. You can insert a page number,
      date, time, or filename with a simple click of a button. In
      addition, you can create multiple-line headers and footers by
      pressing OPTION+ENTER at the point you want to insert a carriage
      return.

      To create a multiline header or footer, follow these four steps:

      a. From the File menu, choose Page Setup.

      b. Click the Header or Footer button.

      c. Select the Left, Center, or Right section depending on where
         you want your text aligned on the page. To select the
         section, click inside the appropriate section box.

      d. Enter some text into the box. At the point where you want to
         insert a carriage return, hold down the OPTION key and press
         ENTER.

3. Q. How can I start my page numbering with a number greater than
      one?

   A. To begin page numbering with a number greater than one, you must
      modify the Header or Footer section in Page Setup. To do so,
      follow these five steps:

      a. From the File menu, choose Page Setup.

      b. Click the Header or Footer button.

      c. The default Footer will have Page &amp;P in the Center alignment
         section. If you prefer to have your page number aligned to
         the left or the right, delete Page &amp;P from the Center section
         and select the appropriate section. To select it, click
         inside the appropriate section box.

      d. Click the button with the pound symbol on it. This will place
         an &amp;P in the box. You may also manually type &amp;P if you
         prefer.

      e. To begin page numbering at a number greater than one, after
         the P, insert a plus sign and the number you'd like the
         numbering to start with, less one. For example, if you want
         the page numbering to begin with 3, insert a plus sign and
         the number 2 after the &amp;P.
