The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition
<LI>Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, versions 5.0, 5.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In the versions of Microsoft Excel listed at the beginning of this article,
underlines you apply to text that has no descending characters may be
overlapped by the text. You can see this problem when you view the
worksheet on the screen and when you view the worksheet in print preview.
<P>
NOTE: This problem does not occur when you print the worksheet. Also, this
problem does not occur in Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 5.0 and
7.0, or in Microsoft Excel 97.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may occur when the text is larger than 32 points.
<P>
The exact point size that makes the problem apparent varies from font to
font and depends on the characters you are using. Commonly used fonts and
the font sizes for which the problem occurs are listed in the following
table.
<P>
<PRE>                     Problem occurs when character is
   Font              "5" and point size is greater than
   ----------------------------------------------------

   Geneva            32 points
   Arial             60 points
   Times New Roman   63 points

</PRE>The problem becomes more noticeable as you increase the point size.
<P>
NOTE: This problem is strictly a display problem; the underlined text is
printed correctly.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If a character has a portion that extends below the base line of text, the
character is said to have a "descender." For example, characters with
descenders include the following lower-case letters:
<P>
<PRE>   g, j, p, q, and y

</PRE>Most other characters do not have descenders.
<P>
Because underlines are positioned below text, characters that have
descenders overlap underlines. However, characters that do not have
descenders may also overlap underlines if you format the character with a
large point size.
<P>
<P><h3>Example</h3>
 
<P>
To see an example of this problem, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>In Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, create a new workbook.

<P><LI>In cell A1 of Sheet1, enter the following text:
<P>
<P><PRE>      This is test 5.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Use the tools on the Formatting toolbar to apply the Geneva font and a
   font size of 36 to cell A1.
<P>
   Note that the underline is overlapped by the character "5."

<P><LI>Change the font size of cell A1 to 72.
<P>
</OL>The characters "t," "e," "s," and "5" all overlap the underline.
