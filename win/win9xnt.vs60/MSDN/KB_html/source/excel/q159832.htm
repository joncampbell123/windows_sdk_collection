The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 97, when you attempt to insert a trendline into a chart,
you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   EXCEL caused an invalid page fault in module EXCEL.EXE at
   014f:30125e69.

</PRE>and Microsoft Excel 97 stops responding.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may occur if all of the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>The series in the chart contain a large (usually, more than 300) number
   of points.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -and-
</PRE>
<LI>The x-axis of the chart uses a time scale.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -and-
</PRE>
<LI>There is already a trendline in the chart.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -and-
</PRE>
<LI>The two trendlines (the one that's already there and the one you are
   trying to insert) contain a different number of points.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To prevent this problem from occurring, don't insert a second trendline
into a chart whose series contain a large number of points, unless it will
have the same number of points as the first trendline.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Excel 97 for
Windows. This problem was corrected in Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows,
Service Release 1.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 97, when you create a chart, the x-axis of the chart may
be formatted with a time scale. This will occur if the first column or row
of data used to create the chart contains numbers formatted as dates.
<P>
When you insert a trendline into a chart, the trendline has a number of
points. This number is determined by the type of the trendline. For
example:

<UL><LI>Linear trendlines have two points.
<LI>Moving average trendlines have the same number of points as the series
   to which they are attached.
<LI>Other trendlines have a number of points that is proportional to the
   width of the plot area in pixels.
<P>
</UL>If the charts x-axis uses a time scale, if the series to which you are
attaching trendlines has a large number of points, and if you insert two
trendlines that contain a different number of points, Microsoft Excel 97
may stop responding.
