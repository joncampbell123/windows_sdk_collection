<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you change the picture that is assigned to an Image control on a
UserForm using the Click event for the Image control, the picture on the
Image control may not be updated.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>

procedures. Microsoft support engineers can help explain the functionality
of a particular procedure, but they will not modify these examples to
provide added functionality or construct procedures to meet your specific
needs. If you have limited programming experience, you may want to contact

</PRE>To work around this problem, assign a new picture to the Image control, and
then use the Repaint method in a Visual Basic for Applications macro to
update the UserForm. The example in this article uses the Repaint method to
update the UserForm. To create and use the sample macro, follow these
steps:

<OL><P><LI>Close and save any open workbooks, and then create a new workbook.

<P><LI>Start the Visual Basic Editor (press OPTION+F11).

<P><LI>On the Insert menu, click UserForm.

<P><LI>Draw an Image control on the UserForm.

<P><LI>Double-click the Image control to display the Code window for the
   UserForm.

<P><LI>In the module, type the following code for the Image control Click
   event:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Private Sub Image1_Click()
<PRE></PRE>        Dim fname As String

        ' Display the Open dialog box.
        fname = Application.GetOpenFilename(filefilter:= _
               "PICT", Title:="Select Image To Open")

        ' Load the picture into the Image control.
        Image1.Picture = LoadPicture(fname)

        ' Update the UserForm.
        Me.Repaint

      End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>Run the UserForm. To do this, switch to the UserForm and click Run
   Sub/UserForm on the Run menu.

<P><LI>Click the Image control. In the "Select Image to Open" dialog box,
   click a bitmap file and click Open.
<P>
</OL>The bitmap file that you select appears in the Image control.
