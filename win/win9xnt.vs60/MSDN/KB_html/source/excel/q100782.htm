<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Excel Goal Seek command (on the Formula menu in Excel version 
3.0 and 4.0, or on the Tools menu in Exel 5.0 and later) is useful when you 
know the result you want a formula to return, but do not know the input 
values the formula needs to reach that result. When you use goal seeking, 
Microsoft Excel varies the value in a specified cell until the formula that 
is dependent on that cell returns a specified result. The following section 
describes the method used by the Goal Seek command to find a result.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In the Goal Seek dialog box, you specify the Set Cell (cell containing the
formula), To Value (the result you want the formula to return), and the By
Changing Cell (one of the cells that the formula is dependent on). Both of
the cell specifications must be a single cell reference or name. The To
Value must be a number.
<P>
The Goal Seek command uses a simple linear search beginning with guesses on
the positive or negative side of the value in the source cell (By Changing 
Cell). Excel uses the initial guesses and recalculates the formula. 
Whichever guess brings the formula result closer to the targeted result (To 
Value) is the direction (positive or negative) in which Goal Seek heads. If 
neither direction appears to approach the target value, Goal Seek makes 
additional guesses that are further away from the source cell. After the 
direction is determined, Goal Seek uses an iterative process in which the 
source cell is incremented or decremented at varying rates until the target 
value is reached.
<P>
The Goal Seek command uses a simple algorithm and, as a result, may have
problems converging on a solution if the function is not linear. Because 
the iteration process begins with guesses around the source cell, if Goal 
Seek is having problems converging on a solution, changing the value in the 
source cell may help. Alternatively, you can use Microsoft Excel Solver.
