The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, versions 7.0, 7.0a
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0c
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you open a file that was created in Microsoft Excel version 7.0, you
may receive a Password dialog box containing one of the following error
messages:
<P>
<P><h3>In Microsoft Excel 97</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   A shared list from Microsoft Excel 95 must be opened Read-Only.

   To edit the workbook in Microsoft Excel 97, click OK, then click Save
   As on the file menu and save the workbook with a new name. You can
   then save the new workbook as a Microsoft Excel 97 shared workbook, if
   you want. For more information, click Help.

</PRE><h3>In Microsoft Excel 5.0</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   '&lt;FILENAME.XLS&gt;' is reserved by XL 95 Users. Open Read Only!

   Enter password for write access, or open read only.

</PRE>where &lt;FILENAME.XLS&gt; is the name of the file that you are opening.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs when you open a file that was saved as a shared file
in Microsoft Excel 7.0. When you turn on the Multi-User Editing
feature in a file in Microsoft Excel 7.0, you are not able to open the file
with read-write access in Microsoft Excel 5.0 or Microsoft Excel 97.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you receive the Password dialog box in Microsoft Excel 5.0 after
opening a file that was saved as a shared file in Microsoft Excel 7.0, if
you enter a password, whether the file has a password or not, you receive
the error message "Incorrect password."
<P>
In Microsoft Excel versions 5.0 and 97, when you open a file that was
created in Microsoft Excel version 7.0 that was not saved as a shared
file, the file opens normally; no dialog box appears.
<P>
NOTE: Microsoft Excel versions 5.0 and 7.0 use the same file format.
Microsoft Excel 97 uses a different format.
