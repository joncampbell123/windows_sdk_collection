<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
You can summarize data from one or more source areas by consolidating it
and creating a consolidation table. These source areas can be on the same
worksheet as the consolidation table, on different sheets in the same
workbook, or in different workbooks. When you consolidate the source data,
you apply a summary function, such as the SUM() function, to create the
summary data.
<P>
There are two ways to consolidate data: by category or by position.
<P>
<PRE>   Consolidation by position: When the data in the source areas is arranged
   in the same order and uses the same labels. Use this method to
   consolidate data from a series of worksheets, such as departmental
   budget worksheets that have been created from the same template.

   Consolidating by category: When the data in the source areas is not
   arranged in the same order but uses the same labels. Use this method to
   consolidate data from a series of worksheets that have different layouts
   but have the same data labels.

      NOTE: Consolidating data by category is similar to creating a
      PivotTable. With a PivotTable, however, you can easily reorganize the
      categories. If you want a more flexible consolidation by category,
      you should consider creating a PivotTable.

</OL>NOTE: If you want Microsoft Excel to update your consolidation table
automatically when the source data changes, select the Create Links To
Source Data check box. You cannot create links when source and destination
areas are on the same sheet.
<P>
<P><h3>Selecting Source Areas for a Consolidation Table</h3>
 
<P>
You specify the source areas of the data you want to summarize in the
Reference box of the Consolidate dialog box. Use these guidelines to define
source areas:

<UL><LI>When the sources and destination are on the same worksheet, use cell
   references.

<LI>When the sources and destination are on different worksheets, use
   sheet and cell references.

<LI>When the sources and destination are in different workbooks, use
   book, sheet, and cell references.

<LI>When the sources and destination are in different workbooks in
   different locations on a disk, use the full path, book, sheet, and
   cell references. You can also type the complete path, workbook name,
   and sheet name for the source area. Type an exclamation point
   following the sheet name, and then type the cell reference or name of
   the source area.

<LI>When the source area is a named range, use its name.
<P>
</UL>TIP: To enter a source definition without typing, click in the Reference
box, and then select the source area.
