<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 3.x, 4.x
<LI>Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, versions 3.x, 4.x
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel versions 3.x and 4.x, all currently open documents, 
except add-in macro sheets, use the same mode of calculation, regardless of 
the mode in which they have been saved.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To help explain how the mode of calculation is determined, this
article refers to the following hypothetical documents:
<P>
<PRE>                                               Saved with this
   Filename      Type of document              mode of calculation
   ---------------------------------------------------------------

   AUTO1.XLS     Worksheet                     Automatic
   MANUAL1.XLS   Worksheet                     Manual
   AUTO1.XLM     Macro sheet                   Automatic
   ADDIN.XLA     Add-in macro sheet            Automatic
   WORKBOOK.XLW  Multisheet Workbook           Automatic

</PRE>The following statements apply to calculation modes in Microsoft
Excel:

<OL><P><LI>The first document you open uses the calculation mode with which it
   was last saved: subsequently opened documents use this same mode.
<P>
   For example, if you first open AUTO1.XLS and then open MANUAL1.XLS,
   both documents will use automatic calculation (the mode used by
   AUTO1.XLS). If you open MANUAL1.XLS first and then open AUTO1.XLS,
   both documents will use manual calculation.

<P><LI>Changing the calculation mode of one open document changes the mode
   for all open documents.
<P>
   If AUTO1.XLS and AUTO1.XLM are both open, changing the calculation
   mode of AUTO1.XLM to manual also changes the mode of AUTO1.XLS to
   manual.

<P><LI>All sheets contained in a workbook use the same mode of
   calculation.
<P>
   If WORKBOOK.XLW contains a worksheet and a macro sheet, changing the
   calculation mode of the worksheet to manual also changes the
   macro sheet's calculation mode to manual.

<P><LI>If all other documents are closed and you create a new document,
   the new document will use the same calculation mode as the
   previously closed documents. However, if you use a template, the
   mode of calculation will be the mode specified in the template.

<P><LI>Add-in macro sheets do not affect the calculation mode of other
   documents.
<P>
   If ADDIN.XLA is open and has its calculation mode set to automatic,
   opening MANUAL1.XLS will switch the calculation mode to manual,
   even though an automatic document (ADDIN.XLA) is already open.
<P>
   The exception to this rule applies if the add-in appears in the
   Unhide dialog box (to unhide a document, press the SHIFT key and
   choose Open from the File menu), in which case the add-in follows
   the same rules as other types of documents.
<P>
</OL><h3>Controlling the Mode of Calculation</h3>
 
<P>
Because open documents all use the same mode of calculation, you will
need to follow special procedures when you want to work with documents
that use different calculation modes. For example, if you are working
with AUTO1.XLS and you want to open MANUAL1.XLS in manual calculation
mode, do either of the following:

<UL><LI>Set AUTO1.XLS to manual calculation mode before you open
   MANUAL1.XLS
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE>
<LI>Close AUTO1.XLS (and any other open documents) before you open
   MANUAL1.XLS
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
There are three modes of calculation in Microsoft Excel: automatic,
automatic except tables, and manual.
<P>
<PRE>   For this mode          Recalculation Occurs When
   -------------------------------------------------------------------

   Automatic              Any change is made to the document. All
                          affected parts of the document are
                          recalculated.

   Automatic              Any change is made to the document. All
   except tables          affected parts of the document EXCEPT TABLES
                          are recalculated. A table is recalculated
                          only when a change is made to it.

   Manual                 You specifically force recalculation.
