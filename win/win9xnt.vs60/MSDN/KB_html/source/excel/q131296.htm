<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, the application window may act as if it is maximized,
even if the window does not appear to be maximized. That is, there may be
a gap between the bottom of the application window and the Windows taskbar
(assuming that the taskbar is located at the bottom of the screen) even
if the application Restore button is available and you are not able to move
or size the application window.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs if you maximize Microsoft Excel, and then change the
display properties scheme in Windows to a scheme that uses a smaller font
and window size. For example, if you are using the Windows Standard
(extra large) scheme (on the Appearance tab in the Display Properties
dialog box), and you maximize the Microsoft Excel application window, if
you then change the scheme to the Window Standard, which uses a smaller
font and window size, the Microsoft Excel application window no longer
appears maximized. A gap appears between the application window and the
Microsoft Windows taskbar, though you cannot maximize the Microsoft Excel
application window.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this behavior when you change the display scheme in
Microsoft Windows to a smaller size, use any of the following methods:
<P>
Method 1: Restore the Microsoft Excel application window by clicking the
<PRE>          Restore button, and then maximize the application window by
          clicking the Maximize button again.

</PRE>Method 2: Minimize the Microsoft Excel application by clicking the
<PRE>          Minimize button, then restore the application again by clicking
          the Microsoft Excel button on the Windows taskbar.

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
