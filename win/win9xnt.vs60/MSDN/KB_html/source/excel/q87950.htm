1. Q. I am using Microsoft Windows version 3.0 and every time I print
      a Microsoft Excel version 3.0 for Windows worksheet to my
      Hewlett-Packard(R) (HP[R]) LaserJet(R) Series III or HP
      DeskJet(R), the row and column headings print, but the cell
      contents do not.

   A. If you are receiving either incomplete print jobs or fonts that
      are different when printed than when they are previewed and you
      are using an HP LaserJet Series III or an HP DeskJet, the
      following three-step procedure may correct the problem:

      Step 1. Quit Microsoft Excel version 3.0 for Windows. Start
      Control Panel by choosing the Control Panel icon in the Program
      Manager.

      Step 2. In Control Panel, choose the Printers icon. Select your
      printer from the Printers list. Choose the Configure button,
      then choose the Setup button. In the Graphics Resolution box,
      select 75 dots per inch. Choose the OK button three times to
      return to Control Panel.

      Step 3. In Control Panel, choose the Printers icon again. Select
      your printer from the Printers list. Choose the Configure
      button, then choose the Setup button. In the Graphics Resolution
      box, select 300 dots per inch. Choose the OK button three times
      to return to Control Panel. From the Settings menu, choose Exit.
      Restart Microsoft Excel 3.0.

      The previous procedure makes the necessary changes to your
      WIN.INI file to print correctly from Microsoft Excel 3.0.

2. Q. I want to change my paper size from letter to legal. Page 531 of
      the "Microsoft Excel User's Guide" for version 3.0 instructs me
      to choose Page Setup from the File menu and select the options I
      want. When I do so, several of the options are unavailable for
      selection. How can I correct this problem?

   A. If certain document settings in the Page Setup dialog box, such
      as Paper Orientation or Fit To Page, are unavailable (dimmed),
      then the printer driver for your printer does not support those
      particular extended options. The HP LaserJet Series III and the
      Epson(R) drivers are among those that do not support extended
      settings.

      If you are using an HP LaserJet Series III and cannot select
      Paper Size or Paper Orientation, you can receive a maintenance
      release from Microsoft for Excel 3.0 for Windows that corrects
      this problem.

       NOTE: The Reduction/Enlargement and Fit To Page options are
       available only with PostScript(R) printers.

      To receive this maintenance release for Microsoft Excel 3.0,
      please call Microsoft Excel for Windows technical support at
      (425) 635-7070.

3. Q. I am using an HP LaserJet Series III printer and am trying to
      print in landscape orientation using legal-size paper. When I
      try to print, Microsoft Excel version 3.0 for Windows generates
      only a partial printout, as if I were still printing on letter-
      size paper. What is causing this problem?

   A. Documents printed from Microsoft Excel version 3.0 for Windows
      to the HP LaserJet III may print in the incorrect orientation
      and/or on the incorrect paper size. This problem occurs
      inconsistently and appears both in print preview and on
      printouts.

      Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the HP LaserJet
      printer driver for Microsoft Excel 3.0. This problem was
      corrected in a maintenance release of Microsoft Excel 3.0 and in
      the HP LaserJet Series III driver version 3.86.

      If you are using an HP LaserJet Series III and cannot print in
      landscape orientation on legal-size paper, you can receive the
      maintenance release of Microsoft Excel 3.0 and the HP LaserJet
      Series III driver from Microsoft. To receive these items, please
      call Microsoft Excel for Windows technical support at (425) 635-
      7070.

4. Q. When I try to change printer settings, Microsoft Excel version
      3.0 for Windows tells me that it can't open the printer driver.
      Is the printer driver damaged?

   A. This message appears if your printer is switched from active to
      inactive in Control Panel. The following three-step procedure
      corrects this problem:

      Step 1. Quit Microsoft Excel version 3.0 for Windows and start
      Control Panel by choosing the Control Panel icon in Program
      Manager.

      Step 2. In Control Panel, choose the Printers icon. Select your
      printer from the Printers list, change the status of your
      printer from inactive to active by choosing the Active button
      and then choosing the OK button.

      Step 3. From the Settings menu, choose Exit. Restart Microsoft
      Excel 3.0.

      If the previous procedure does not correct this problem, your
      printer driver may be corrupt and need to be reinstalled. For
      help reinstalling your printer driver, please refer to page 161
      of the "Microsoft Window's User's Guide" for version 3.0.

5. Q. When I try to print a Microsoft Excel version 3.0 for Windows
      worksheet, my print titles print twice on the first page of the
      print job. How can I correct this problem?

   A. You have set print titles without defining a print area. To
      correct this problem, select the data you want to print,
      excluding the rows or columns you have designated as print
      titles. From the Options menu, choose Set Print Area.

      For more information regarding print titles, please refer to
      pages 533-534 of the "Microsoft Excel User's Guide" for version
      3.0.
