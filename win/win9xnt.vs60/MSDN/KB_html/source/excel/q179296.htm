<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition uses a method to edit, delete, or
restore menus and menu items that is different from earlier versions of
Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh. This article explains the differences
among toolbars, menu bars, and command bars in Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh
Edition. This article also explains in detail how to do the following in
Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition:

<UL><LI>Delete an entire menu

<LI>Delete a single menu item

<LI>Restore an entire menu

<LI>Restore a single menu item

<LI>Change settings for a specific menu item

<LI>Reset a menu item to its original settings
<P>
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Behavior in Microsoft Excel Version 5.0</h3>
 
<P>
In Excel 5.0, toolbars and menu bars are separate. The differences between
toolbars and menu bars are described as follows.
<P>
Toolbars:

<UL><LI>Contain toolbar buttons.

<LI>Can be docked or undocked (floating).

<LI>Can be edited by clicking Toolbars on the View menu.
<P>
</UL>Menu Bars:

<UL><LI>Contain menus and menu items.

<LI>Can only be docked (at the top of the screen).

<LI>Can be edited by clicking Menu Editor on the Tools menu in a Visual
   Basic for Applications module sheet.
<P>
</UL><h3>Behavior in Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition</h3>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition, toolbars and menu bars no longer
exist as separate components. "Command bars" have replaced both toolbars
and menu bars. Command bars include all of the functionality of toolbars
and menu bars in addition to new functionality.
<P>
Command Bars:

<UL><LI>Contain toolbar buttons, menus, and menu items.

<LI>Can be docked on any edge of the screen or can be undocked (floating).

<LI>Can be edited by clicking Toolbars on the View menu.
<P>
</UL>Although toolbars and menu bars no longer exist separately in Microsoft
Excel 98 Macintosh Edition, most Visual Basic for Application commands that
are designed to work with these items still function, and elements of the
user interface use the older terminology. For example, there is a Toolbars
menu command on the View menu.
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition, you can edit command bars when the
Customize dialog box is displayed. To display this dialog box, click
Customize on the Tools menu.
<P>
The Customize dialog box is a special dialog box. When it is displayed,
you can click menus, menu items, and toolbar buttons on command bars.
<P>
IMPORTANT: In the following steps, when you are instructed to click a menu
or menu item, do not click inside the Customize dialog box. Instead, click
the menu or menu item.
