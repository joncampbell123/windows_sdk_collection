<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel for Windows, your system may slow drastically if
you have a linked picture adjacent to the range it's linked to and if
you update any cells in that range. When you take a picture of a range
of cells and paste that picture so that it touches any part of the
original range, borders and gridlines included, you are taking a
picture of a picture each time you update any cell in the original
range. This causes your system resources to be quickly depleted and,
as a result, your system will slow down drastically.
<P>
<P><h3>Workaround</h3>
 
<P>
To fully restore your system resources, exit completely out of the
Windows operating environment and run Microsoft Windows again.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The only way to prevent this problem from occurring in Microsoft Excel
is to put a column or row between the linked picture and the original
range. You can resize the column or row to be as small as you like as
long as there remains a clear space between the linked picture and the
range.
