The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 2.x, 3.0, 4.0,4.0a, 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If you are running Microsoft Excel for Windows with OS/2 version 2.0,
you can increase the speed of the Copy and Paste operations by setting
the WIN-OS/2 clipboard Option to Private.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
OS/2 version 2.0, has access to two clipboards: the OS/2 clipboard and
the WIN-OS/2 clipboard. The OS/2 clipboard accepts information from
OS/2 window sessions, Presentation Manager sessions, MS-DOS sessions,
one or more programs in a WIN-OS/2 session, or any combination of
these; the WIN-OS/2 clipboard exchanges data between WIN-OS/2
sessions. Under OS/2 version 2.0, clipboards have a Public or Private
option setting which affects an application's ability to copy and
paste data between sessions. By default, the setting for the WIN-OS/2
clipboard is Public--this setting allows data to be passed through the
WIN-OS/2 clipboard to the OS/2 clipboard. However, this functionality
slows down the Microsoft Excel Copy and Paste operations.
<P>
To increase the speed of Microsoft Excel Copy and Paste operations,
set the WIN-OS/2 clipboard option to Private. When the WIN-OS/2
clipboard is set to Private, only programs that are started during
that session will be able to copy, cut, or paste to the clipboard. If
you want to exchange data between sessions, choose the Import or
Export commands from the File menus of each clipboard.
<P>
To set the WIN-OS/2 clipboard to Private, follow the appropriate
procedure below.
<P>
If Microsoft Excel is set to run in Full Screen mode:

<OL><P><LI>Minimize Excel and activate the WIN-OS/2 clipboard.

<P><LI>From the clipboard Option menu, clear the Public Clipboard
   option.
<P>
</OL>If Microsoft Excel is set to run seamlessly or in Windowed mode:

<UL><LI>Modify the SYSTEM.INI file to disable the Public Clipboard option.
   (The SYSTEM.INI file, under OS/2 2.0, is located in the
   OS2\MDOS\WINOS2 directory.)
<P>
   1. Open the SYSTEM.INI file in a text editor and search for the
<P><PRE>      [Boot] section.
</PRE><P>
   2. Remove the "!clipwos2" parameter from each of the following
<P><PRE>      lines:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>         SAVDMApps=!gopm,!clipwos2,!ddeagent
         MAVDMApps=!gopm,!clipwos2,!ddeagent,!printman
         WOS2VDMApps=!clipwos2,!ddeagent

      These lines should now appear as:

         SAVDMApps=!gopm,!ddeagent
         MAVDMApps=!gopm!ddeagent,!printman
         WOS2VDMApps=!ddeagent

   3. Save the SYSTEM.INI file and restart Microsoft Excel for
      Windows.

</PRE></OL>An alternate method is available by simply closing the clipboard on
the Windows Shell. Select the clipboard and choose close when the menu
comes up. This forces it to use the OS/2 clipboard. This can still
copy to Win/OS2 applications and to OS/2 applications.
