The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, versions 7.0, 7.0a
<LI>Microsoft Small Business Financial Manager for Microsoft Excel,
   version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you launch the Microsoft Small Business Financial Manager for
Microsoft Excel (SBFM) you may receive the following error:
<P>
<PRE>   Small Business Financial Manager is not loaded or not installed. The
   Program may not function properly without it

</PRE>and your only option is to click OK.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
You may receive the aforementioned error if both of the following are true:

<UL><LI>You have both Microsoft Excel version 5.0 and version 7.0 on your
   machine.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>You tried to launch SBFM from the Desktop shortcut.
<P>
</UL>If you have both version 5.0 and 7.0 of Microsoft Excel on your machine,
when you double-click the SBFM shortcut, Microsoft Excel version 5.0 may be
the version that is started by Windows. Since SBFM is not designed for
Microsoft Excel version 5.0, you will receive the error message if this
version of Microsoft Excel is started.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, you can do either of the following:

<UL><LI>Start Microsoft Excel version 7.0 first (from the Microsoft Excel
   shortcut on the Programs menu, or the Office Shortcut Bar for example).
   Since the SBFM add-in will load automatically, you will be able to
   access the features of SBFM from the Accounting menu that is added to
   the menu bar.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Reinstall Microsoft Excel version 7.0 with the "/y" switch. This will
   rebuild the Windows registry to list it as the current version of
   Microsoft Excel.
<P>
</UL>To reinstall Microsoft Excel version 7.0 with the "/y" switch, do the
following:

<OL><P><LI>Quit any Microsoft Office programs that are currently running, including
   the Office Shortcut bar.

<P><LI>In Windows Explorer, open up the folder in which you have the setup
   program for Microsoft Excel version 7.0 (or the setup program for
   Microsoft Office for Windows 95 if this is how you installed Microsoft
   Excel version 7.0).

<P><LI>On the Start menu, click Run and delete anything in the Open drop-down
   box.

<P><LI>Drag the Shortcut for Setup from the folder in Step 2 and drop it onto
   the Run dialog box.
<P>
   The full path to the Setup Shortcut will appear in the Run dialog box.
   For example, if you dropped the Office Setup shortcut onto the Run
   dialog box, the command line in the Open drop-down will read, by
   default, c:\msoffice\setup.lnk.

<P><LI>Modify the command line in the Open drop-down by adding "/y", without
   quotes, to the end of the command line, so the above example will
   now read, c:\msoffice\setup.lnk /y. Note, make sure there is a space
   separating the path to the setup shortcut and the /y switch.

<P><LI>In the Run dialog box, click run.
<P>
   This will start the setup maintenance program.

<P><LI>In the Setup dialog box, click Reinstall.

<P><LI>When Setup finishes, click OK.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If you workaround the problem by following either of the steps in the
Resolution section you may subsequently receive the same error message. The
problem may resurface if you restart Microsoft Excel version 5.0 as this
will reset the registry, listing it as the current version of Microsoft
Excel. Therefore, if you double-click the SBFM Desktop shortcut Microsoft
Excel version 5.0 may be launched instead of version 7.0.
