<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you check the spelling in a worksheet that contains a cell that
contains at least 256 characters, one or more of the following problems may
occur:

<UL><LI>Up to 12 characters, starting with the 256th character, are converted
   into random binary characters. For example, these characters are
   converted to squares or other strange characters.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE>
<LI>You receive the following error message:
<P>
<P><PRE>      The text string you entered is too long. Reduce the number of
      characters used or cancel the entry.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE>
<LI>You receive the following error message:
<P>
<P><PRE>      This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut
      down. If the problem persists, contact the program vendor.
</PRE><P>
   If you click Details, you receive an error message similar to either
   of the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      EXCEL caused an invalid page fault in module EXCEL.EXE at
      0137:304dbb1e.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      EXCEL caused an invalid page fault in module EXCEL.EXE at
      0137:30258b90.
</PRE><P>
   When you click Close, Microsoft Excel 97 quits.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
These problems may occur if the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>One or more cells in the worksheet contain more than 256 characters.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -and-
</PRE>
<LI>In the Spelling dialog box, you click Undo Last.
<P>
</UL>The second and third problems are more likely to occur if the cell you are
checking contains more than 304 characters.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around these problems, do not click Undo Last if any cells in the
worksheet contain more than 256 characters.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the spelling checker in Microsoft Excel 97, you can undo the
most recent action performed in the Spelling dialog box by clicking Undo
Last.
<P>
Note that the problems described in this article occur only if you click
Undo Last; you can usually check the spelling of any cell, no matter how
many characters it contains, without receiving any error messages.
