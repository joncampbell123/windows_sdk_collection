The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, version 5.0, 5.0c
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, if you are not using a color printer and you open or
create a line or scatter chart, the chart data markers are displayed
differently in print preview than they are in the chart or worksheet view.
<P>
NOTE: These charts will also be printed differently than they are in
earlier versions of Microsoft Excel. For example, in Microsoft Excel
version 4.0, if multiple series on your line chart use the same style data
marker, each series is displayed in print preview and is printed with a
different style or color data marker when you use a non-color printer. When
you open the same chart in Microsoft Excel versions 5.0 and 7.0, each
series is displayed with the same style data marker in print preview and
when you print the chart, with varying degrees of shading to distinguish
the different series.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design of Microsoft Excel. In Microsoft Excel
versions 5.0 and 7.0, when you display a chart in print preview, or print
the chart, using a non-color printer, the different series are
distinguished by shading, instead of by using different style data markers
in black and white. This way, the same data marker style that you apply to
the series is displayed in print preview and when you print the chart.
<P>
This behavior is different from previous versions of Microsoft Excel. In
previous versions of Microsoft Excel if you are using a non-color printer,
and you display a chart in print preview, or when you print the chart, the
different series are distinguished by data marker style, and the data
marker is displayed in black and white.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
To print your chart in black and white, and to use the data marker styles
from earlier versions of Microsoft Excel, do the following:
<P>
<P><h3>Embedded Chart</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Select the sheet that contains your embedded chart.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Page Setup.

<P><LI>Select the Sheet tab.

<P><LI>Under Print, select the Black And White check box, and choose OK.
<P>
</OL><h3>Chart Sheet</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Select the chart sheet that contains your chart.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Page Setup.

<P><LI>Select the Chart tab.

<P><LI>Under Printing Quality, select the Print In Black And White check
   box, and choose OK.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you select the Print In Black And White check box on the Chart tab in
the Page Setup dialog box, your chart is printed and displayed in print
preview in black and white. Patterns replace colors to distinguish the
different data series. By default, this check box is cleared. When it is
cleared, colors are printed in grayscale on a black-and-white printer and
in colors on a color printer.
<P>
When you select the Black And White check box on the Sheet tab in the Page
Setup dialog box, your cells and drawing objects, including embedded
charts, are printed and displayed in print preview in black and
white.
