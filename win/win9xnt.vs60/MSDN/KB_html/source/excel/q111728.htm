The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Microsoft Excel for Windows, version 5.0
 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel version 5.0 for Windows, if you save a worksheet
that contains an embedded chart as a password-protected Microsoft
Excel 4.0 worksheet, you will receive a general protection (GP) fault
if you try to open the file in Microsoft Excel version 5.0.
<P>
If you save a workbook that contains an embedded chart as a password-
protected, Microsoft Excel 4.0 workbook, when you attempt to reopen the
workbook, you will receive the error message
<P>
<PRE>   Cannot load an empty Microsoft Excel 4.0 workbook

</PRE>and you will be unable to open the file.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs because of the way that information is written to a
password-protected file. In Microsoft Excel version 5.0, the embedded chart
is encrypted along with the rest of the worksheet (or workbook); however,
Microsoft Excel version 4.0 does not encrypt embedded charts in password-
protected worksheets and workbooks. Because of this difference in the way
embedded charts are saved, a worksheet or workbook that contains embedded
charts that has been saved with a password from Microsoft Excel version 5.0
cannot be opened in either Microsoft Excel version 4.0 or version 5.0.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To avoid this problem, if your worksheet or workbook contains embedded
charts, do not save it as a password-protected Microsoft Excel 4.0
worksheet or Microsoft Excel 4.0 workbook.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in
Microsoft Excel for Windows version 5.0c.
