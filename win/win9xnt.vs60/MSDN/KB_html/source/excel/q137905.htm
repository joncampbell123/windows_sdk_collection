NETWORK INSTALLATION
<P>
If you have a license to install Microsoft Office on more than one
client computer, there are two ways you can install Office in your
organization. You can distribute the Office disks to each end user
or you can install Office on a network and have each end user
install from there. The information in this file explains the
second option.

</PRE><h2>INSTALLING MICROSOFT OFFICE ON A NETWORK</h2>
 
<P>
Installing Office over the network is a two step process:

<OL><P><LI>The administrator creates the administrative installation
    point by creating the set of folders that will hold all the
    Office software and from which client installations will be
    done.

<P><LI>Users install Office by running Setup from the administrative
    installation point.
<P>
</OL>The same Setup.exe is used for each of these steps, although in
two different modes. To avoid confusion in the discussion below,
these two modes will be referred to as follows:
<P>
<PRE> * Administrative Setup
   - To create the administrative installation point, you run
     Setup.exe from the physical media with the /a command line
     option.

 * Client Setup
   - To perform a client installation, a user runs Setup.exe from
     the administrative installation point without the /a command
     line option.

</PRE></OL><h3>Creating the administrative installation point</h3>
 
<P>
You need to run administrative Setup under Windows 95, Windows NT
3.51 (or later), or Windows NT Advanced Server 3.51 (or later).
<P>
The administrative installation point must have at least 180MB of
disk space, and you (the administrator) must have read, write,
delete, and create permission to this location. Users need read
access as well. If your users will be running in a shared Windows
environment, you need to run Setup in that same environment and
you need write and create permissions to the Windows folders.
<P>
Using the administrative mode of Setup, you need to install all of
the Office files from the CD or floppy disks to the administrative
installation point. This consists of two primary folders which
will be created by Setup:

<OL><P><LI>\Msoffice - The main Office application files, such as
    Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel will be installed in this
    folder.

<P><LI>\Msapps - Shared components, such as Art Gallery and Word Art,
    will be installed in this folder.
<P>
</OL><h3>Administrative installation</h3>
 
<P>
Before doing the administrative installation of Office, make sure:

<UL><LI>Destination folders are empty. If a previous version of Office
   exists, delete all of it.
<LI>Users sharing applications or running shared Windows from this
   server are logged off.
<LI>Folders are locked to network user access during administrative
   installation.
<LI>Virus detection software is disabled.
<P>
</UL>To install Office on the administrative installation point:

<OL><P><LI>Run Setup.exe from the CD or floppy disk with the command line
    option /a: "setup.exe /a". Setup.exe must be run from a
    workstation with write access to the server, not directly on
    the server itself.
<P>
    NOTE: Double-clicking on Setup.exe in the File Manager
    (Windows NT) or Explorer (Windows 95) will not work. You need
    to use the Run command on the File menu of Program Manager or
    File Manager (Windows NT), or the Run command in the Start
    menu (Windows 95) to use the command line option /a. If you
    double-click on Setup.exe it will perform a client
    installation.

<P><LI>Follow the instructions on the screen.
<P>
    NOTES:
<P>
     - The organization name you enter will be used for all client
       installations of Office from this network location.
<P>
     - When asked for the server and path for the shared
       applications folder, enter the name in the same way that
       users will specify it when installing Office. You can
       specify whether the server will be accessed by users with a
       drive letter (for example, G:\) or a UNC path (for example,
       \\server\share). If you select drive letter, users
       installing Office will need to have that drive letter mapped
       to this folder before running client Setup.
<P>
     - When Setup asks where you want the shared application files
       installed, the option you select controls the choices your
       users will have during client Setup:
<P>
<PRE>        + Server............The shared application files will remain
                            on the server and run remotely; the user
                            won't get a choice during client Setup.
        + Local Hard Drive..The shared application files will be
                            copied to the user's local hard drive;
                            the user won't get a choice during
                            client Setup.
        + User's Choice.....The user will be asked to choose Server
                            or Local Hard Drive during client Setup.

</PRE></OL>Setup then copies all files from the CD or floppy disks to the
administrative installation point.
<P>
After the installation is complete, share the two folders
(\Msoffice and \Msapps) on the network, either creating a
single share that contains both folders, or creating two
separate shares, one for each folder.
<P>
<P><h3>Client installation</h3>
 
<P>
To install Office on the client computers, users will:

<OL><P><LI>Connect to the main Office folder on the administrative
    installation point.

<P><LI>Run Setup.exe.
<P>
</OL>When users run client Setup from this administrative installation
point, they will see the Run From Network Server option in
addition to the other installation options. If a user selects this
option, the main Office application files are left on the server
and run remotely.
<P>
Note that when using the Run From Network Server option, Setup
will place approximately five megabytes of files in the user's
main Office folder. For workarounds that can reduce this disk
space usage, see chapter 8, "Installing Microsoft Office" in the
"Microsoft Office for Windows 95 Resource Kit," or contact Product
Support Services. See "For More Information" at the end of this
file for instructions on obtaining the resource kit or connecting
to support resources.
<P>
It is recommended that users have a read-only connection to the
server Office folder when they are running Setup, and also when
they are running the applications after a Run From Network Server
installation.
<P>
<P><h2>INSTALLATION ISSUES</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Installing Office in Shared Windows for the First Time</h3>
 
<P>
The first time Office is installed to a user's computer in a
shared Windows environment, Setup will attempt to copy a few
Office files into the shared Windows folder. Although users
normally have read-only access to the shared Windows folder,
the first client installation of Office does require write
access to copy these files.
<P>
After the first installation is completed, the first user's
access rights to the shared Windows folder can be set back
to read-only. Subsequent users installing Office need only
read-only access to the Windows folder since the needed
files will already be present and Setup won't attempt to
copy them again.
<P>
<P><h3>Creating "My Documents" Folder on a Server for Multiple Users</h3>
 
<P>
If you have users who install Office in a user folder on a
network share (for example, users running on diskless
workstations), the Office client installation process must
be planned carefully to insure that multiple users do not
share the same "My Documents" folder for their personal
documents. "My Documents" is the default folder used by
Office applications for saving the user's personal document
files.
<P>
Office Setup will create the folder "My Documents" in the
root of the drive to which Office is being installed. For
example, if a user installs Office to c:\Msoffice, then
Setup will create the folder "c:\My Documents" for that
user's personal documents.
<P>
If a user installs Office to a user folder on a network
share, "My Documents" will be created at the root of that
share. If multiple users, then, install Office to separate
user folders on a single network share, a single "My
Documents" folder will be created at the root of that share
for all users. This can cause document sharing issues
because they will all be using the same "My Documents"
folder for their personal documents.
<P>
For example, suppose two users have drive letter G mapped to
the same network server share:
<P>
<PRE>  user1 - g:  mapped to  \\Server\Share
  user2 - g:  mapped to  \\Server\Share

</PRE></OL>The two users run Office Setup and install Office into
subfolders of this server share:
<P>
<PRE>  user1 - g:\User1\Msoffice  =  \\Server\Share\User1\Msoffice
  user2 - g:\User2\Msoffice  =  \\Server\Share\User2\Msoffice

</PRE>As each user runs Setup, it will create the folder "My
Documents" at the root of drive G. Because each user's drive
G is mapped to the same network location, Setup will
actually create a single "My Documents" folder at the root
of the share:
<P>
<PRE>  user1 - g:\My Documents  =  \\Server\Share\My Documents
  user2 - g:\My Documents  =  \\Server\Share\My Documents

</PRE>Both users will then be using the same "My Documents" folder
for their personal documents, with each user having access
to the other user's documents.
<P>
To avoid this situation, users must be mapped directly to
their own specific subfolder on the network share. Following
the previous example, suppose each user has drive letter G
mapped directly to their own subfolder on the server share:
<P>
<PRE>  user1 - g:  mapped to  \\Server\Share\User1
  user2 - g:  mapped to  \\Server\Share\User2

</PRE>Each user then installs Office to "g:\" and Setup will
create the "My Documents" folder at the root of that drive.
Because each user has mapped drive G to a separate folder,
they will each have their own "My Documents" folder:
<P>
<PRE>  user1 - g:\My Documents  =  \\Server\Share\User1\My Documents
  user2 - g:\My Documents  =  \\Server\Share\User2\My Documents

</PRE>Before any users install Office to network locations, you
need to insure that each user is mapped to a separate folder
on the network share. This means that you need to make sure
the appropriate network shares are defined in advance, and
you need to edit user login scripts where the mapping occurs
or inform users of the correct mapping procedure.
<P>
For additional information and workarounds, see chapter 8,
"Installing Microsoft Office" in the "Microsoft Office for
Windows 95 Resource Kit." See "For More Information" at the
end of this file for instructions on obtaining the resource
kit.
<P>
Information on this issue can also be obtained by contacting
Product Support Services, or connecting to the support
resources outlined in the individual product helpfiles under
"Getting Help", "Connect to Microsoft technical resources."
<P>
<P><h3>Support for Long Filenames on Novell 3.11</h3>
 
<P>
If the shared Office files reside on a Novell 3.11 server,
then a client installation using the Run From Network Server
installation option will not work correctly. This is due to
a problem in the way Novell handles long file names.
<P>
There is a patch available from Novell to correct this. It
is in a file called os2ptch.nam which replaces the standard
Novell 3.11 file os2.nam.
<P>
Once this patch is installed on the Novell 3.11 server, make
sure the long file name feature of Windows 95 is turned on
by setting the following entry in the Windows 95 system.ini
file:
<P>
<PRE> [nwredir]
 SupportLFN=2

</PRE><h3>Run From Network Server Errors on Novell 3.11</h3>
 
<P>
On some network configurations, the Run From Network Server
client installation option may fail when the Windows 95
driver for the DEC EtherWorks Turbo / TP (DE201) network
adapter is being used on a Netware 3.11 server. Some of the
error messages that can occur are:

<OL><P><LI>BOOTSTRP caused a general protection fault in module
    SETUP.EXE.

<P><LI>The ordinal 65535 could not be located in the dynamic link
    library Kernel32.dll.

<P><LI>The application failed to initialize properly (0xc0000005).
<P>
</OL>To avoid such errors, a different network adaptor should be
used in the server.
<P>
<P><h2>COPYING DISKS AND EXTRACTING FILES MANUALLY</h2>
 
<P>
Your Microsoft Office disks use a format called DMF (Distribution
Media Format), which increases the capacity of a 3.5-inch floppy
disk.
<P>
<P><h3>WARNING</h3>
 
<P>
Because DMF is a newer format, many existing utilities such as
Norton Disk Doctor, Microsoft ScanDisk, MS-DOS DiskCopy, and
Microsoft Windows Copy Disk do not recognize DMF. Do not use disk
utilities to examine a DMF formatted disk, as these utilities can
corrupt the DMF disk. You cannot copy DMF formatted disks using MS-
DOS DiskCopy or Microsoft Windows Copy Disk. For a complete
discussion of DMF format, see the "Microsoft Office for Windows 95
Resource Kit," or see, "Using Disks  with Distribution Media
Format," in the Office Readme file, OFREADME.TXT located in your
Office folder.
<P>
