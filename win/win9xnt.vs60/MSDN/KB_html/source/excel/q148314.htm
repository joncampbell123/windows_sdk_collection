<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Template Wizard with Data Tracking is an add-in for Microsoft Excel.
The Template Wizard allows you to transform a workbook into an online
template or form, and to link it to a designated database. The Template
Wizard walks you through a five-step process of creating the database
template that you use to automatically add data to a database or a
Microsoft Excel workbook.
<P>
Each time you type new data in a copy of the template and save it as a
separate workbook, the wizard automatically adds the data to a database
that you specify.
<P>
To use the Template Wizard, you must first install it. Then, in the Add-
Ins dialog box, select the Template Wizard With Data Tracking check box.
<P>
To link templates to dBASE or Microsoft FoxPro databases, you must also
install the appropriate Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) driver. In
addition, you must select the ODBC Add-In option in the Add-Ins dialog box.
<P>
For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

</PRE>Wizard
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The add-in discussed in this article is provided "as is" and Microsoft
does not guarantee that it can be used in all situations. Although
Microsoft Technical Support can help with the installation and existing
functionality of this add-in, they will not modify the add-in to provide
new functionality.
<P>
The process for using the Template Wizard includes creating a workbook that 
contains the layout for the data, defining a template based on the layout 
in the workbook and an associated database, deciding whether to consolidate 
existing data from separate workbooks, and saving the template and the 
database.
<P>
<P><h3>Creating a Template</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Open the workbook that contains the layout of the data columns you
   plan to use in the template. If you have not created a workbook, do
   so before you start the wizard.

<P><LI>To start the wizard, on the Data menu, click Template Wizard.
<P>
   In the first step in the Template Wizard, you need to define the name
   of the template. The name of the active workbook appears in the first
   drop-down list in the dialog box. Note that the list includes the
   names of all open workbooks.

<P><LI>Click the name of the workbook that contains the layout of the data,
   and then click Next.

<P><LI>In step 2 of the wizard, in the Database Type box, select the type of
   database you plan to create. The default is Microsoft Excel Workbook.
   However, you can select other Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) file
   types.

<P><LI>In the Database Location And Name box, select a folder location and
   name for the database file. Click Browse to change the database name
   or folder location, or to select an existing database that does not
   appear in the current folder. Then, click Next.

<P><LI>In step 3 of the wizard, define the links between the cells in the
   workbook and the fields in the database file. To define the links
   between cells and fields, click the Cell No. 1 box, click the cell in
   the workbook in which you will type new data, and press the TAB key.
<P>
   When you press the TAB key, the wizard automatically types a name in
   the Field Name box. The name that the wizard uses is determined by
   the name in the workbook that is above or to the left of the cell
   that you specified in the Cell box. Note that you can change the name
   of the field name by typing over it.

<P><LI>Continue to define the links between all the cells in the workbook
   you want to link to the database, and the fields in the database
   file. Use a different Cell box for each cell. When you finish
   establishing the links, click Next.

<P><LI>In step 4 of the wizard, determine whether to merge existing
   workbooks into the specified database. To merge information, click
   "Yes, Include." If you do not want to merge an existing workbook,
   click "No, Skip It."
<P>
   NOTE: To merge an existing workbook, the data in the workbook must be
   arranged in the same format as the template. You can decide to merge
   an existing workbook at a later time. (See the "Merging Existing
   Data" section in this article.)

<P><LI>Click Next. Then, in Step 5 of the wizard, click Finish.
<P>
</OL><h3>Using the Template</h3>
 
<P>
To automatically add data to the database file, you can open a workbook
based on the template that you created with the wizard, type new data in
the workbook, and save the workbook.
<P>
To create a workbook based on the template, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Verify that the template is in the Office\Templates folder.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click New, select the template, and then click OK.

<P><LI>Type the data you want to add to the database file.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Save.
<P>
   In the dialog box that appears, the following options exist: Create A
   New Record and Continue Without Updating. When you type new data in
   the same workbook and save the file again, a third option, Update The
   Existing Record, appears.

<P><LI>To add the data, click Create A New Record, and then click OK.
<P>
   Note that you can use the same workbook to continue adding more data
   to the database file. To reuse the workbook in this way, retype new
   data in the linked cells, save the file, and click Create A New
   Record. You can modify an existing record by clicking Update The
   Existing Record.
<P>
</OL><h3>Merging Existing Data</h3>
 
<P>
You can merge data from other workbooks either when you create the
template or after you create the template.
<P>
NOTE: To merge data from another workbook to the database file, the data
must be arranged with the same layout as the template. If the data in the 
workbook has a different layout, the wizard adds a blank record to the 
database file without displaying a warning message.
<P>
To merge data after you create the template, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the File menu, click Open, and open the Templates folder (located
   in the folder that contains Office).

<P><LI>In the Files Of Type box, click Document Templates (*.dot), and open
   the template you created using the Template Wizard.

<P><LI>On the Data menu, click Template Wizard, and continue to click Next
   until you see step 4 of the wizard.

<P><LI>In step 4 of the wizard, click "Yes, Include," and then click Next.

<P><LI>In the next dialog box that appears, click Select.

<P><LI>In the Select Files To Convert dialog box, select the workbook that
   contain the data you want to add to the database file, click Open,
   and then click Finish.
