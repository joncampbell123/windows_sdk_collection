The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition, the following problems may occur:

<UL><LI>When you delete a worksheet, you receive the following error message:
<P>
<P><PRE>      The application "Microsoft Excel" has unexpectedly quit, because an
      error of type 2 occurred.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      You should save your work in other open applications and restart the
      computer.
</PRE><P>
   and Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition shuts down.

<LI>If you click the Tools menu, point to Auditing, and click Remove All
   Arrows, you receive the preceding error message, and Microsoft Excel
   shuts down.

<LI>Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition shuts down without displaying any
   error messages.

<LI>When you save a workbook, you receive the following error message:
<P>
<P><PRE>      This workbook contains features that are not supported by the file
      format that you selected. To avoid the possible loss of formatting
      or information, be sure to save a copy in the most recent Microsoft
      Excel Workbook format.
</PRE><P>
   Note that you receive this message even if you are saving the workbook
   in the Microsoft Excel Workbook format.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
These problems occur when the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>You copy a worksheet that contains auditing arrows in the same workbook
   or move this worksheet to another workbook.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -and-
</PRE>
<LI>You attempt to delete the new worksheet, to remove auditing arrows from
   the new worksheet, to select an auditing arrow, or to save the workbook
   that contains the worksheet.
<P>
</UL>Auditing arrows in Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition are not designed to
be copied. As a result, if you copy a worksheet that contains auditing
arrows, the arrows on the new worksheet may become unstable. This may cause
problems if you attempt to delete the new worksheet, save the workbook,
select an auditing arrow, or remove the auditing arrows from the new
worksheet.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To prevent these problems from occurring, remove all auditing arrows in the
worksheet before you copy it. To remove the arrows, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Activate the worksheet that contains the auditing arrows.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, point to Auditing, and then click Remove All Arrows.
<P>
</OL>After you copy the worksheet, you can make the auditing arrows available.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition, you can use auditing arrows to
trace dependents, precedents, and errors. To use auditing arrows, follow
these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Select the cell you want to audit.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, point to Auditing, and then click Trace Precedents,
   Trace Dependents, or Trace Error, as appropriate.
<P>
</OL>If you click Show Auditing Toolbar, you can use the tools on the Auditing
toolbar to audit cells.
