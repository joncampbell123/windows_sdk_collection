<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, if you type text that begins with an apostrophe
character (') in the Find What box in the Find or Replace dialog box, and
then click Find Next, you receive one of the following error messages:
<P>
<PRE>   Cannot find matching data

   -or-

   Microsoft Excel cannot find the data you're searching for. If you are
   certain the data exists in the current sheet, check what you typed and
   try again.

</PRE>If you click Replace All, you receive one of the following error messages:
<P>
<PRE>   Cannot find matching data to replace

   -or-

   Microsoft Excel cannot find matching data to replace. No cell in the
   selection contains what you typed, or no records match the criteria.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The engine for the Find and Find Next commands does not recognize a
leading apostrophe character because this character in this position
is designed to be transparent.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, use any of the following methods.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1</h3>
 
<P>
Replace the contents of a single cell that contains text that begins with
an apostrophe character. To do this, use the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Select the cell that contains the text that you want to replace, and
   click Replace on the Edit menu.

<P><LI>In the Find What box, type the text that you want to replace, such as
   "xxx" (without the quotation marks). Do not include the apostrophe.

<P><LI>In the Replace With box, type the text that you want to appear in the
   cell, such as "zzz" (without the quotation marks) and click Replace.
<P>
</OL><h3>Method 2</h3>
 
<P>
Replace the contents of multiple cells that contain text entries that begin
with apostrophes. To do this, use the following Visual Basic for
Applications procedure to remove hidden leading apostrophes from a selected
range of cells.

   ' Removes hidden apostrophes as first character
   ' Works on formulas as well as text and values

   Sub RemoveApostrophe()

       For Each CurrentCell In Selection
           If CurrentCell.HasFormula = False Then

               'Checks to make sure that procedure does not
               'change cell with a formula to be only the value
               CurrentCell.Formula = CurrentCell.Value
           End If
       Next

   End Sub

</PRE></OL><h3>Method 3</h3>
 
<P>
Replace the contents of a single cell, or multiple cells that contain text
that begins with an apostrophe character. To do this, use the following
steps:

<OL><P><LI>In an empty cell on the worksheet, type the value 1.

<P><LI>Select the cell that contains the value 1, and click Copy on the Edit
   menu.

<P><LI>Select the cells that contain the text that you want to replace, and
   then click Paste Special on the Edit menu.
