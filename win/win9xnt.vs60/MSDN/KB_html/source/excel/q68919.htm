<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Canceling split windows in Microsoft Excel is more precise in versions
3.0 and later than it was in earlier versions.
<P>
<P><h2>How to Split</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Excel version 5.0 and 4.0</h3>
 
<P>
From the Window menu, choose Split. The window is split above and to the
left of the active cell, to the left of the selected column, or above the
selected row.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Excel versions 3.0 and 4.0</h3>
 
<P>
From the window control box (-), choose Split to display a cursor with a
four-sided arrow in the center of two gray bars. The cursor can be placed
anywhere on the worksheet to split the window into four panes.
<P>
<P><h2>How to Cancel a Split</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Excel version 4.0 and 5.0</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Double-click any part of the split bar, or choose Remove Split
   from the Window menu.
<P>
</OL>An alternative method for removing a split using the keyboard alone,
version 4.0 only:

<OL><P><LI>Select the document control menu (ALT+HYPHEN).

<P><LI>Select Split from the menu.

<P><LI>Press CTRL+HOME, and then the ENTER key.
<P>
</OL><h3>Microsoft Excel version 3.0</h3>
 
<P>
To cancel the split window panes in version 3.0:

<OL><P><LI>Select the document control menu (ALT+HYPHEN).

<P><LI>Drag (use the mouse or press the UP and LEFT ARROW keys) the split
   bars to the upper left of the screen.

<P><LI>Move the split bars just to the left of the column numbers and just
   above the column headings. The cursor must be placed EXACTLY at
   this location or the window will not appear as normal.

<P><LI>Click the mouse (or press ENTER).
<P>
</OL>Note: To ensure that you are exactly at this location, you can use the
keyboard arrow keys. Move left and up as far as you can. At this point
you should be in the exact location.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In versions of Microsoft Excel earlier than 3.0, you can drag the split
window bars beyond the worksheet windows and click the mouse, this
effectively cancels the split windows. Performing the same mouse movements
in later versions has no effect and the window remains split. However, in
later versions, you can drag the split window bars to the very edge of the
worksheet window to remove them, you do not have to click the mouse.
