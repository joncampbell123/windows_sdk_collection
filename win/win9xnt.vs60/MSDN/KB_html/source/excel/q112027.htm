The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Microsoft Excel for Windows, version 5.0, 5.0a
 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, you may receive a general protection (GP) fault when
you check the spelling in a worksheet if a cell on the worksheet contains
text in the following format
<P>
<PRE>   &lt;recognized word&gt;&lt;period&gt;&lt;space&gt;&lt;unrecognized word&gt;

   -or-

   &lt;recognized word&gt;&lt;space&gt;&lt;unrecognized word&gt;

</PRE>where &lt;recognized word&gt; is a word that is in the spelling dictionary,
and &lt;unrecognized word&gt; is a word that is not in the spelling
dictionary.
<P>
For example, if you select a cell that contains the following text
<P>
<PRE>   Dr. Einstein

</PRE>and press F7 or choose Spelling from the Tools menu to run the
spelling checker, you may receive a GP fault because the word "Dr" is
in the dictionary, the word "Einstein" is not (unless you added it
previously), and the two words are separated by a period and a space.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This error occurs because of the way that Microsoft Excel handles data that
is returned from its spelling system. When you check the spelling of a cell
that contains a recognized word followed by a period, a space, and an
unrecognized word as described above, Microsoft Excel may be unable to
properly establish the conditions for an Undo of the Spelling command, and
you receive the GP fault.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in
Microsoft Excel for Windows version 5.0c.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
To avoid losing data when you check the spelling in a worksheet, do the
following:

<UL><LI>Before you run the spelling checker, save the workbook that contains the
   worksheet. If possible, save the workbook to a second location (make a
   backup of the workbook) also. This ensures that you have a saved copy of
   the file in case you receive a GP fault while checking spelling in the
   worksheet.
<P>
</UL>To avoid receiving the GP fault under the circumstances described above you
can use one of the following solutions:

<UL><LI>Add any unrecognized words to the custom spelling dictionary BEFORE you
   use them with abbreviations or a period in a cell. For example, if your
   worksheet contains the following information
<P>
<P><PRE>      Dr. Einstein
      Ms. Earhart
      Gen. Eisenhower
</PRE><P>
   do the following to add the names Einstein, Earhart, and
   Eisenhower to the custom spelling dictionary:
<P>
   1. Create a new worksheet in a new workbook.
<P>
   2. In the new worksheet, enter the names or words that you want to add
<P><PRE>      to the custom spelling dictionary (do not enter the titles such as
      Dr., and so on).
</PRE><P>
   3. From the Tools menu, choose Spelling. If you are prompted to
<P><PRE>      "Continue checking at beginning of sheet?" choose Yes.
</PRE><P>
   4. Each unrecognized word appears in the Spelling dialog box as not
<P><PRE>      being in the dictionary. For each word, choose the Add button.
      Continue until all words are added to the custom dictionary.
</PRE><P>
   5. When you receive the message "Finished spell checking entire
<P><PRE>      sheet," choose OK.
</PRE><P>
   You can now check the spelling of the worksheet that contains the words
   "Dr. Einstein", "Ms. Earhart", and "Gen. Eisenhower", without receiving
   a GP fault.
