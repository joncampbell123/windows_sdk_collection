The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, version 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, when you use a wildcard character in a sheet name
in the Consolidate dialog box, you receive the following error messages
<P>
<PRE>   Cannot open consolidation source file '[BOOK1.XLS]sheet*'

   Cannot find 'SHEET*'

   Cannot open consolidation source file 'SHEET*'

   No data was consolidated

</PRE>where BOOK1.XLS is the name of the workbook that contains the worksheets
that you want to consolidate, and SHEET* is the reference that you entered
to consolidate all of the worksheets that begin with the word SHEET.
<P>
Additionally, when you choose Consolidate again from the Data menu, the
reference that you entered is listed twice in the All References list; once
with the worksheet name in capitals, and once in lowercase, as in the
following example:
<P>
<PRE>   'sheet*'!$A$1
   'SHEET*'!$A$1

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs because you cannot use the asterisk (*) or question
mark (?) wildcard character to consolidate multiple sheets in a workbook.
This behavior is by design of Microsoft Excel. However, seeing multiple
error messages and multiple occurrences of the sheet reference may be
confusing. This problem occurs only when you include the book name in the
Reference box in the Consolidate dialog box, and then use the Add button,
instead of the OK button, to enter the reference.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To avoid receiving these error messages, and having the sheet reference
with the wildcard character listed twice, do either of the following:

<UL><LI>Use a separate reference for each worksheet that you want to
   consolidate. For example, to consolidate the data in cells A1:D10 on
   Sheet1 and Sheet2 located in BOOK1.XLS, use the following references:
<P>
<P><PRE>      [BOOK1.XLS]SHEET1!A1:D10
      [BOOK1.XLS]SHEET2!A1:D10
</PRE><P>
   -or-

<LI>Use 3D references to consolidate data within a workbook. For example, to
   sum the values in cells A1:D10 on Sheet1 and Sheet2 located in
   BOOK1.XLS, use the following formula:
<P>
<P><PRE>      =SUM(SHEET1:SHEET2!A1:D10)
</PRE><P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in
Microsoft Excel for Windows version 5.0c.
<P>
Note that in Microsoft Excel version 5.0c, you still cannot consolidate
multiple sheets in a workbook using the asterisk (*) or question mark
(?) wildcard character. However, when you attempt this, you do not
receive the duplicate "Cannot open consolidation source file..." error
message, or the "Cannot find..." error message (the other error messages
appear), and the reference is only listed once in the All References list.
