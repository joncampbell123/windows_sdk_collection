The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, version 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, if you copy a selection on a worksheet while multiple
sheets are selected, and you paste the selection as a Microsoft Excel 5.0
Worksheet object in another application (client), you cannot ungroup a
module sheet from the selected sheets when you edit the worksheet object in
the client application.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When you select multiple sheets in a workbook, and copy a range of
cells on a worksheet, and then paste the selection as a worksheet
object in a client application, the sheets remain selected (grouped)
when you edit the worksheet object. When the group of sheets includes
a module sheet, the module sheet remains selected even after choosing
the Ungroup Sheets command.
<P>
This behavior occurs because you cannot select a module sheet in a
Microsoft Excel 5.0 Worksheet object. However, this means that if you
select a module sheet before you create the worksheet object, you cannot
ungroup the module sheet when you edit the object.
<P>
Because you cannot ungroup a module sheet in a worksheet object, certain
actions such as Delete Sheet and Move Or Copy Sheet (Edit menu) affect the
module sheet as well as the selected worksheet.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To avoid this behavior, do not include a module sheet in the selection of
sheets when you copy a range of cells in group mode in order to paste them
as a worksheet object in another application.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in a
later version of Microsoft Excel.
<P>
In Microsoft Excel version 5.0c, when you edit a Microsoft Excel version
5.0 Worksheet object that contains a module sheet in group mode, the
object opens in Microsoft Excel, instead of being activated for in-place
editing in the client application.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Note that you cannot ungroup selected sheets in a Microsoft Excel 5.0
Worksheet object by selecting a sheet tab of one of the inactive
sheets. Instead, to ungroup selected sheets while editing a worksheet
object in a client application, click the right mouse button on one
of the sheet tabs, and choose Ungroup Sheets.
