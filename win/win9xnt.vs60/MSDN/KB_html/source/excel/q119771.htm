<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Some third-party applications have the ability to save files in a Lotus
1-2-3 version 1a format (wks). It is possible for these applications to
create a spreadsheet with more than 2048 rows. If this spreadsheet is then
opened in Microsoft Excel, row 2049 will appear as row 1, row 2050 as row
2, and so on.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
In the event a Lotus 1-2-3 1a (wks) spreadsheet opened into Microsoft
Excel exhibits the behavior mentioned in the Symptoms section, do the
following:

<OL><P><LI>Open the file in Lotus 1-2-3 using a version later than 1a.

<P><LI>Save the file as version 2.x format using the file extension WK1.

<P><LI>Open the file in Microsoft Excel.

<P><LI>Save the file in Microsoft Excel format by choosing the File Type of
   Normal for Microsoft Excel version 3.0 and 4.0 or Microsoft Excel
   Workbook for version 5.0.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
It is not possible to save a spreadsheet from Lotus 1-2-3 version 1a with
more than 2048 rows. However, files created by a third-party application
may create more than 2048 rows when creating a Lotus wks spreadsheet.
<P>
NOTE: Lotus 1-2-3 version 2.x, 3.x, and 4.x have a maximum row limit of
8192.
