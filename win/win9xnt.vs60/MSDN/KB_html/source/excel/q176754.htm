The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In the versions of Microsoft Excel listed at the beginning of this article,
if you undelete one or more columns that contain a formula by clicking Undo
Delete on the Edit menu, the formula in the undeleted column may move down
several cells within the column.
<P>
If you then undelete one or more rows by clicking Undo Delete on the Edit
menu, the formula in the undeleted column may disappear completely.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
These problems may occur when the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>There is a numeric value in any cell in the range A18:A65536.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -and-
</PRE>
<LI>The formula is located in any cell in the range B2:IV16.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -and-
</PRE>
<LI>You delete any row from row 1 through row 16 (inclusive) by selecting
   the row and clicking Delete on the Edit menu.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -and-
</PRE>
<LI>You then delete the column that contains the formula by selecting the
   column and clicking Delete on the Edit menu.
<P>
</UL>When you undelete the column, the formula moves down within the column to
row 16 (for example, from B3 to B16). When you undelete the row, the
formula disappears completely.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Do not undelete columns or rows that contain formulas when the conditions
in the "Cause" section are true.
<P>
To work around these problems, you must manually correct the formulas in
the worksheet. If you have previously saved the workbook, you may be able
to close the workbook without saving changes, and then reopen the workbook.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
