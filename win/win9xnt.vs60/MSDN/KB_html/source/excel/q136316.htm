The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you are using a non-English version of Microsoft Excel and you open a
workbook that contains a map that was created with Microsoft Data Map, you
may only be able to open other workbooks via the Open dialog box or by
dragging the file to Microsoft Excel. In addition, Microsoft Excel may fail
to respond to DDE commands sent to it by other applications.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs because of the way in which Microsoft Data Map
communicates with Microsoft Excel 7.0. When you open a workbook that
contains a map, Data Map causes Microsoft Excel to accept incoming DDE
commands in English only (even if you are using a non-English version of
Microsoft Excel). This behavior continues even after Microsoft Excel has
finished processing information from Data Map. This behavior will prevent
Microsoft Excel from accepting most (if not all) incoming DDE commands.
<P>
When Microsoft Excel is in this state, you will be unable to open files
from any of the following locations:

<UL><LI>The Start menu (this includes openning files by clicking the Open Office
   Document button).

<LI>The Desktop, Explorer, or My Computer (either by double-clicking the
   file on the Desktop or by double-clicking a shortcut that points to the
   file).
<P>
</UL><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
To reset the DDE language settings for Microsoft Excel, exit and restart
Microsoft Excel.
<P>
NOTE: If you need to send DDE commands to Microsoft Excel, do NOT open
files that contain maps created in Microsoft Data Map.
<P>
To open a file in Microsoft Excel after a file containing a map has already
been opened, use either of the following methods:
<P>
Method 1: Use the Open dialog box:
<P>
<PRE>          1. Click Open on the File menu, or click the Open button on the
             Standard toolbar.

          2. Select the file you want to open, and then click Open.

</PRE>Method 2: Drag the file to the Microsoft Excel window:
<P>
<PRE>           - From My Computer, Explorer, or the Desktop, select the file
             you want to open and drag it to the Microsoft Excel title bar.
             When the icon is over the title bar, release the mouse button
             to drop the file. The file should be opened normally.

           - If Microsoft Excel is minimized, drag the icon for the file
             onto the Microsoft Excel button on the Taskbar. After a second
             or two, the Microsoft Excel window will restore itself. You
             can then drop the file on the Microsoft Excel title bar.

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
