The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, version 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0
</UL>

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, when you select a file from the File Name list in the
Picture or Insert File dialog box, the filename that appears in the File
Name box does not contain a period (.) if the file name does not have an
extension.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
If you create a file with a file name that does not have an extension, such
as "TEST.", the file appears in the File Name list without the period. This
behavior is by design in Microsoft Excel. However, when you select the file
in the Picture, or the Insert File (in a module sheet) dialog box, the file
name that is displayed in the File Name box does not contain the period.
This problem does not occur in the Open dialog box.
<P>
Note that this behavior does not create a problem when you insert a
picture, or a file. Additionally, when you create a file with a file name
that does not have an extension, the period is not displayed when you view
the file in File Manager.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in a
later version of Microsoft Excel.
