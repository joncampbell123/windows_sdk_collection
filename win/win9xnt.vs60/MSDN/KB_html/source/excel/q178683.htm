The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In the versions of Microsoft Excel listed at the beginning of this article,
if you press either TAB or SHIFT+TAB to move from cell to cell in a
worksheet, some cells in the worksheet may not be selected, even though
they are unlocked.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may occur when the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>The worksheet contains one or more merged cells. The merged cells, as
   well as other cells, have been unlocked through the following
   steps:
<P>
<P><PRE>    1. Selecting the cells.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    2. On the Format menu, clicking Cells, and then selecting the
       Protection tab.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    3. Clicking to clear the Locked check box, and then clicking OK.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    -and-
</PRE>
<LI>The worksheet has been protected by clicking the Tools menu, pointing
   to Protection, and clicking Protect Sheet.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -and-
</PRE>
<LI>The Visual Basic EnableSelection property of the worksheet is set to
   1, or xlUnlockedCells.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -and-
</PRE>
<LI>The cells that are not selected are adjacent to the merged cells.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To prevent this problem from occurring, set the EnableSelection property of
the worksheet to zero (0), or xlNoRestrictions. To do this, follow the
steps in either Method 1 or Method 2.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>On the View menu, point to Toolbars, and click Control Toolbox.

<P><LI>Click the Properties tool in the Control Toolbox.

<P><LI>In the list of objects, select the worksheet (for example, Sheet1).

<P><LI>In the list box to the right of EnableSelection, select "0 -
   xlNoRestrictions".

<P><LI>Close the Properties window.
<P>
</OL><h3>Method 2</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, point to Macro, and click Visual Basic Editor.

<P><LI>If the Project Explorer window is not visible, click Project Explorer
   on the View menu.

<P><LI>In the Project Explorer, select the name of the worksheet (for
   example, Sheet1).

<P><LI>On the View menu, click Properties Window.

<P><LI>In the list box to the right of EnableSelection, select "0 -
   xlNoRestrictions".

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Close And Return To Microsoft Excel.
<P>
</OL>You should now be able to use TAB and SHIFT+TAB to select all of the
unlocked cells in the worksheet.
<P>
Note that you can also use the pointer to select unlocked cells in a
worksheet, even if the EnableSelection property is set to xlUnlockedCells.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In the versions of Microsoft Excel listed at the beginning of this article,
you can merge multiple cells in a worksheet into a single cell by following
these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Select the cells that you want to merge.

<P><LI>On the Formatting toolbar, click the Merge And Center tool. Or, click
   Cells on the Format menu, select the Alignment tab, click to select
   the Merge Cells check box, and click OK.
<P>
</OL>When you protect a worksheet, you can use TAB and SHIFT+TAB to select the
unlocked cells in the worksheet, one cell at a time in order. However, if
the EnableSelection property of the worksheet is set to xlUnlockedCells,
cells that are adjacent to merged cells may not be selected.
<P>
The following steps demonstrate this problem:

<OL><P><LI>In Microsoft Excel, create a new workbook.

<P><LI>In Sheet1, select cells B2:D4. On the Formatting toolbar, click the
    Merge And Center tool.

<P><LI>Select cells B2:E5. On the Format menu, click Cells. Select the
    Protection tab. Click to clear the Locked check box, and click OK.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, point to Protection, and click Protect Sheet.
    Click OK.

<P><LI>Select cell B2. Then, press the TAB key or SHIFT+TAB repeatedly.
<P>
    Note that each unlocked cell in the worksheet is selected as you press
    either the TAB key or SHIFT+TAB.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, point to Macro, and click Visual Basic Editor.

<P><LI>If the Project Explorer window is not visible, click Project Explorer
    on the View menu.

<P><LI>In the Project Explorer, select the name of the worksheet (for
    example, Sheet1).

<P><LI>On the View menu, click Properties Window.

<P><LI>In the list box to the right of EnableSelection, select "1 -
    xlUnlockedCells".

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Close And Return To Microsoft Excel.

<P><LI>Select cell B2. Then, press the TAB key repeatedly.
<P>
    Note that cells E3 and E4 are not selected; the selection jumps
    directly from cell E2 to cell B5.

<P><LI>Select cell B5. Then, press SHIFT+TAB repeatedly.
<P>
</OL>Note that cells E2 and E3 are not selected; the selection jumps directly
from cell E4 to cell B2.
