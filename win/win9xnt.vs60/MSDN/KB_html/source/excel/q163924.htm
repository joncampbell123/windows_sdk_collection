The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you perform a Web query in Microsoft Excel, you may receive the
following error message
<P>
<PRE>   Unable to open &lt;Uniform Resource Locator&gt;. Cannot locate the Internet
   server or proxy server.

</PRE>and no data is returned by the Web query.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs if you are not connected to the Internet or if you are
connected to the Internet through a proxy server in a network environment
and you are not logged on to the network.
<P>
Note that if you use Dial-Up Networking, you may not be connected to your
service provider. The Web query feature in Microsoft Excel does not dial
your service provider and cannot be configured to do so.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this behavior, use either of the following methods.
<P>
<P><h3>Dial-Up Networking</h3>
 
<P>
If you use Dial-Up Networking to connect to the Internet through an
internet service provider, connect to your service provider, and then
perform the Web query.
<P>
To dial your service provider, point to Programs on the Start menu,
point to Accessories, and then click Dial-Up Networking. In the Dial-Up
Networking window, double-click the preconfigured connection icon
for the service provider.
<P>
If no icons, other than "Make a New Connection" appear, double-click "Make
a New Connection." Type the appropriate information for your service
provider in the "Make New Connection" dialog boxes, and then click Finish.
An icon for the connection you created appears in the "Make a New
Connection" window.
<P>
<P><h3>Proxy Server</h3>
 
<P>
If you use a proxy server in a network environment to connect to the
Internet, verify that you are logged on to the network. Also, check with
you network administrator to see whether the proxy server is working
correctly.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design of Microsoft Excel 97.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 97, Web queries allow you to query data from a specific
World Wide Web site, Internet, or intranet site, and then return the
information directly into a Microsoft Excel worksheet. Microsoft Excel 97
includes some sample Web queries, which are located in the Program
Files\Microsoft Office\Queries folder.
<P>
To perform a Web query, point to Get External Data on the Data menu, and
then click Run Web Query. Then, locate and select the .iqy file that
contains the query and click Get Data in the Run Query dialog box.
<P>
