The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you print a worksheet or view a worksheet in print preview or page
break preview in Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition, the text and borders
of cells at the edge of the page may be truncated or may be printed on
another page.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may occur when you apply a combination of rotated text,
borders, and the Shrink To Fit formats to a cell.
<P>
NOTE: The "More Information" section of this article contains an example
that demonstrates this problem.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
You can work around this problem or lessen the severity of this problem by
using any of the following methods.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1</h3>
 
<P>
In the worksheet, select the range of cells that you want to print,
including cells that surround the cells that contain rotated text. Then,
point to Print Area on the File menu, and click Set Print Area.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 2</h3>
 
<P>
Clear the Shrink To Fit check box for the cells that contain rotated text.
To do this, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Select the cells with rotated text.

<P><LI>On the Format menu, click Cells. Click the Alignment tab.

<P><LI>Clear (uncheck) the Shrink To Fit check box. Then, click OK.
<P>
</OL><h3>Method 2</h3>
 
<P>
Remove the border from the cells that contain rotated text. To do this,
follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Select the cells with rotated text.

<P><LI>On the Format menu, click Cells. Click the Border tab.

<P><LI>Click None, and then click OK.
<P>
</OL>When you print the worksheet or view it in print preview or page break
preview, the cells with rotated text appear correctly. Note that it may be
necessary to use two or more of these methods to correct the problem.
<P>
If the rotated text still does not appear correctly, try deleting page
breaks, inserting or removing columns, or manually adjusting the widths of
columns in the worksheet.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs because of the way Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition
calculates the position of page breaks when a column contains cells with
rotated text and borders. Normally, when you rotate text in a cell in
Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition, the cell remains rectangular in
shape. However, if you apply a border to the cell, the cell becomes a
parallelogram. If the parallelogram crosses a page break, Microsoft Excel
may truncate some parts of the cell or may display the parts on another
page.
<P>
<P><h3>Example</h3>
 
<P>
To see an example of the problem, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>In Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition, create a new workbook.

<P><LI>In cell B2 of Sheet1, enter the following text:
<P>
       This is a test.

<P><LI>Select cell B2. On the Format menu, click Cells.

<P><LI>Click the Alignment tab. In the Degrees box, type 30. Click
    the Shrink To Fit check box.

<P><LI>Click the Border tab, click Outline, and then click OK.

<P><LI>On the View menu, click Page Break Preview.

<P><LI>Click 200% in the Zoom box on the Standard toolbar.
<P>
    Note that the last part of the text in cell B2 is cut off by the page
    break to the right of column B.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Print Preview.
<P>
    Note that parts of the cell are also truncated in print preview.

<P><LI>Click Close.

<P><LI>Select cell B2. On the Format menu, click Cells. Click the Alignment
    tab. Clear (uncheck) the Shrink To Fit check box. Click OK.
<P>
    Note that the text is no longer truncated. However, the border around
    cell B2 is truncated when you print or print preview the worksheet.

<P><LI>Select cells A1:D2. On the File menu, point to Print Area, and then
    click Set Print Area.
<P>
    The text and borders of cell B2 are no longer truncated because the
    Print area completely encompasses the cell with the rotated text.
