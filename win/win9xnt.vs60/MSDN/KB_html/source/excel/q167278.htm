<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you insert a control from the Control Toolbox into a worksheet in
Microsoft Excel 97, the following problems may occur:

<UL><LI>When you click the control, it does not work. Instead, the pointer
   changes into the selection cursor. This behavior occurs even if the
   worksheet is in run mode not in design mode.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE>
<LI>When you click the control, a copy of the control appears on another
   worksheet. This "ghost" copy does not work; it is an image of the
   control. The copy disappears if you update the screen by switching to
   another worksheet or by scrolling to a different part of the worksheet.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
These problems occur when you use more than one window to view a workbook
and you attempt to click a control. After you insert a control into a
worksheet, the control works only in the window that is active when
you insert the control.
<P>
For example, assume that two windows display the contents of a workbook you
named Book1. The windows that display the workbook may be named Book1:1 and
Book1:2. If you insert a control in the Book1:1 window, the control does
not work if you click it in the Book1:2 window. Also, if you click the
control in the Book1:2 window, a copy of the control may appear in the
Book1:1 window if a different worksheet is active in the Book1:1 window.
<P>
These problems occur because inserted controls work only in the window in
which you insert them.
<P>
For more information about reproducing this problem, see the “More
Information” section in this article.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Excel 97 includes controls that you can insert into worksheets by
using the Control Toolbox toolbar. Some of the commonly used controls are
as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   Check Box        Toggle Button
   Text Box         Spin Button
   Command Button   Scroll Bar
   Option Button    Label
   List Box         Image
   Combo Box

</PRE>To see the problems that are described in this article, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>In Microsoft Excel 97, close all open workbooks. Then, create a new
    workbook and switch to Sheet1.

<P><LI>On the Window menu, click New Window. Then, click Arrange on the
    Window menu, click Tiled, and then click OK.
<P>
    The Bookx:1 and Bookx:2 windows appear.

<P><LI>Display the Control Toolbox toolbar by clicking the View menu,
    pointing to Toolbars, and clicking Control Toolbox.

<P><LI>Switch to the Bookx:1 window.

<P><LI>On the Control Toolbox toolbar, click the Toggle Button tool. Then,
    draw a button in the Bookx:1 window.
<P>
    Note that the toggle button appears in both windows.

<P><LI>On the Control Toolbox toolbar, click Exit Design Mode.

<P><LI>In the Bookx:1 window, click the toggle button.
<P>
    Note that the button works correctly.

<P><LI>Switch to the Bookx:2 window and click the toggle button.
<P>
    The button does not work. Also, you cannot move it because the
    worksheet is in run mode.

<P><LI>Switch to the Bookx:1 window, and select a different worksheet
    (for example, Sheet2).
<P>
    Note that Sheet2 does not contain a toggle button.

<P><LI>Switch to the Bookx:2 window. Click the toggle button.
<P>
    A toggle button appears in Sheet2 in the Bookx:1 window.

<P><LI>Switch to the Bookx:1 window. Click the toggle button in Sheet2.
<P>
    The toggle button does not work, because it is a copy of the real
    button.
<P>
    Note that you can select cells behind the button and enter values in
    them.

<P><LI>In the Bookx:1 window, switch to Sheet1. Then, switch to Sheet2.
<P>
    The copy of the toggle button disappears.
   
    Note that the toggle button in Sheet1 of the Bookx:1 window works
    correctly.
