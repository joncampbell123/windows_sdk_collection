The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel Viewer for Windows 95, version 7.0
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Excel Viewer is a stand-alone program that is available from
Microsoft free of charge. You can use Microsoft Excel Viewer to view, copy,
zoom, and print files that you create in Microsoft Excel versions 2.0 and
later for Windows and Microsoft Excel versions 2.2 and later for the
Macintosh. Note also that Microsoft Excel viewer includes an AutoFilter
feature that is similar to the AutoFilter feature in Microsoft Excel.
<P>
The Viewer program makes it easy for you to exchange Microsoft Excel
documents with other people and view these documents on your computer. In
addition, Microsoft Excel Viewer supports OLE objects and allows you to
view any file created in Lotus 1-2-3.
<P>
Microsoft Excel Viewer will not allow you to edit an open document,
although you can use it to copy or paste information from the Clipboard and
drag data from any open Microsoft Excel document. These viewing and
manipulation features make Microsoft Excel Viewer a capable and convenient
Microsoft Excel document browsing tool and an ideal replacement for the
Quick Viewer supplied with Windows 95.
<P>

   TITLE     : How to Obtain Microsoft Support Files from Online Services

</PRE><h2>HOW TO INSTALL THE MICROSOFT EXCEL VIEWER</h2>
 

<OL><P><LI>The Microsoft Excel Viewer's Setup program is designed to run properly
    only if Windows 95 or Windows NT is running. If Windows is not
    running, start Windows before continuing.

<P><LI>Close all open programs and turn off any utilities or virus
    protection programs.

<P><LI>If you downloaded the self-extracting file, double-click it to
    automatically start Setup. If you obtained the Microsoft
    Excel Viewer on disk, double-click the Setup.exe file on Disk 1.

<P><LI>The Setup program will prompt you for a folder in which to install
    the Microsoft Excel Viewer. The default folder location for the
    Microsoft Excel Viewer is c:\Program Files\Xlview.

<P><LI>Click Installation to install Microsoft Excel Viewer.

<P><LI>If the Setup program detects Microsoft Excel for Windows (version 5.0
    or later), Setup will then prompt you to determine which program to use
    as the default program when you open Microsoft Excel documents. The
    default program is used whenever you open .xls, .xlt, or .xlm files.
<P>
    - Clicking Yes (open with Microsoft Excel) means that Microsoft Excel
      for Windows will be used by default to open Microsoft Excel files.
<P>
    - Clicking No (open with Viewer) means that Microsoft Excel Viewer will
      be used by default to open Microsoft Excel files.
<P>
       NOTE: If you choose this option, you must run the Microsoft Excel
       for Windows Setup program to restore Microsoft Excel for Windows as
       the default program for Microsoft Excel documents. For more
       information regarding how to restore Microsoft Excel as the default
       program, see the Readme.txt file that comes with the Viewer program.

<P><LI>To run Microsoft Excel Viewer, click the Start button on the Windows 95
    Taskbar, click Programs, and click Microsoft Excel Viewer.
    Alternatively, you can run Microsoft Excel Viewer by double-clicking
    the Xlview.exe  file in your Xlview folder.
