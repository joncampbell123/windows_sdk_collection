<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 4.0, 4.0a
<LI>Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Pages 407-413 of the "Function Reference," contain incorrect
information about the SOLVER functions. For information about a
particular SOLVER function, see the appropriate section below.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>SOLVER.ADD()</h3>
 

<UL><LI>The first paragraph of the second column on page 407 states that
   the formula "may be a formula (as text) or a reference to a range
   of cells." This section should also note that if the formula is
   entered as text and contains any references, the references must be
   entered using R1C1 notation.

<LI>The first bulleted item in the right column on page 407 states:
<P>
<P><PRE>      If "relation" is 4, "formula" is ignored, and "cell_ref" must be
      a subset of the By Changing Cells.
</PRE><P>
   This information is incorrect. If "relation" is 4, "formula" is not
   ignored. You must use either "=integer" or "integer" (including the
   quotation marks) for "formula."

<LI>The second bulleted item in the right column of page 407 states:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ...the number of cells in the range must match the number of cell
      in "cell_ref," although the shape of the areas need not be the
      same.
</PRE><P>
   This information is not entirely correct. A many-to-one ratio is
   acceptable. For example, "A1:A4 &lt;= B1" will work properly.
<P>
</UL><h3>SOLVER.DELETE()</h3>
 

<UL><LI>The Remarks section on page 408 states that "The 'formula' argument
   is not used."
<P>
   This information is not entirely correct. If there are two or more
   constraints for which "cell_ref" and "relation" are the same (for
   example, A1 &lt;= 5 and A1 &lt;= B1), the "formula" argument is not
   ignored.
<P>
</UL><h3>SOLVER.LOAD()</h3>
 

<UL><LI>This function does not work when applied to a worksheet unless the
   worksheet has already had a Solver model saved onto it.

<LI>The first bulleted item in the left column of page 410 states "The
   last cell optionally contains an array of Solver option values (see
   SOLVER.OPTIONS)."
<P>
</UL>The SOLVER.OPTIONS() function uses a array that is in a different
order than the array used by SOLVER.LOAD(); therefore, this statement
should read:
<P>
<PRE>   The order of the options is the same as the top-to-bottom order in
   the Solver Options dialog box.

</PRE><h3>SOLVER.RESET()</h3>
 
<P>
The description of the SOLVER.RESET() function states that this
function "is performed automatically when you call SOLVER.LOAD." This
information is not entirely correct: SOLVER.RESET() does not reset the
options, and so previously set options will be used unless the
SOLVER.LOAD() model includes new options settings.
<P>
<P><h3>SOLVER.SOLVE()</h3>
 
<P>
The values and stopping conditions listed on page 413 are incorrect.
The correct values and Stopping conditions are:
<P>
<PRE>   Value           Stopping condition
   ---------------------------------------------------

   0               Solver found a solution. All constraints and
                   optimal conditions are satisfied.

   1               Solver has converged to the current solution. All
                   constraints are satisfied.

   2               Solver cannot improve the current solution. All
                   constraints are satisfied.

   3               Stop chosen when the maximum iteration limit was
                   reached.

   4               The Set Cell values do not converge.

   5               Solver could not find a feasible solution.

   6               Solver stopped at user's request.

   7               The conditions for Assume Linear Model are not
                   satisfied.

   8               The problem is too large for Solver to handle.

   9               Solver encountered an error value in a target or
                   constraint cell.

  10               Stop chosen when the maximum time limit was
                   reached.

  11               There is not enough memory available to solve the
                   problem.

  12               Another Microsoft Excel instance is using
                   SOLVER.DLL(). Try again later.

  13               Error in model. Please verify that all cells and
                   constraints are valid.

</PRE><h2>SOLVER.SOLVE?()</h2>
 
<P>
Page 412 of the "Function Reference" suggests that the SOLVER.SOLVE?()
form of the SOLVER.SOLVE() function exists. This information is
incorrect: there is no such command.
