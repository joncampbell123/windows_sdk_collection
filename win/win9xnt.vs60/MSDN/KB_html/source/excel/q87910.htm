1. Q. How can I change the order in which the data series are plotted
      or the series names are used in the legend?

   A. Microsoft Excel version 3.0 for the Macintosh allows you to
      directly modify both the order in which the data series are
      plotted from a worksheet and the order in which series names are
      used in the legend or chart title. This feature is available
      only in versions 3.0 and later.

      To do these procedures, you must be in full menu mode:

      Step 1. Activate the chart by selecting the Window menu and
      choosing the chart. If this is an embedded chart, double-click
      the chart to open it in a chart window.

      Step 2. From the Chart menu, choose Edit Series. From within
      this dialog box, you can edit chart information.

      To change the order in which the data series are plotted, follow
      these two steps:

      Step 1. From the Chart menu, choose Edit Series. Under Series,
      select the series you want to reorder.

      Step 2. In the Plot Order edit box at the bottom of the dialog
      box, type the number that represents the order in which you want
      the series to be plotted.

      To alter the series name used in the legend, follow these two
      steps:

      Step 1. From the Chart menu, choose Edit Series. Under Series,
      select the series you want to reorder.

      Step 2. In the Name edit box, type an absolute reference for the
      data series name, or type the name.

      To enable the changes to Edit Series, choose either the Define
      button or the OK button.

      For more information regarding the edit series feature of Excel,
      please refer to pages 441-443 of the "Microsoft Excel User's
      Guide" for version 3.0.

2. Q. How do I create a chart directly on the worksheet? Once I place
      a chart on the worksheet, how do I edit it?

   A. To place or "embed" an Excel chart on an Excel worksheet, follow
      these five steps:

      Step 1. Select the data on the worksheet you want to chart.

      Step 2. Click the Chart tool on the Excel tool bar. The Chart
      tool is the fourth button from the right on the tool bar. When
      you select the Chart tool, your mouse pointer changes to a cross
      hair.

      Step 3. Position the cross hair on the worksheet where you want
      the upper-left corner of the chart.

      Step 4. To create your chart area, hold down the mouse button
      while you drag the mouse down and to the right.

      Step 5. Release the mouse button; the embedded chart now
      appears.

      If you want to make changes to an embedded chart, double-click
      the chart to open it in a chart window. Once the chart appears
      in a chart window, you can make editing and formatting changes.

      For more information on creating embedded charts, please refer
      to pages 391-394 of the "Microsoft Excel User's Guide" for
      version 3.0.

3. Q. How can I create a multiple-line title on my chart?

   A. You can insert a line break in text attached to a chart title,
      data markers, any axis label or data marker label, as well as in
      unattached text. To insert a line break in the text, place the
      cursor in the Formula bar where you want the text to break, and
      press COMMAND+OPTION+RETURN. To enter the text onto the chart,
      press RETURN.

      For more information on adding chart text, please refer to page
      473 of the "Microsoft Excel User's Guide" for version 3.0.

4. Q. How can I attach the worksheet values to my chart?

   A. To attach worksheet values to a chart, follow the next three
      steps:

      Step 1. To attach worksheet values to all the data points in a
      chart, activate the chart by choosing it from the Window menu.

      Step 2. From the Gallery menu, choose either Column or Bar
      depending on the chart type desired.

      Step 3. Select chart type number 7.

      If you want the worksheet values attached to all the data points
      for a different type of chart, follow the preceding steps, and
      then from the Format menu, choose Main Chart. Under Main Chart
      Type, select the chart type desired.

      To attach a worksheet value to a single data point in any type
      of chart, follow the next three steps:

      1. Press COMMAND and click the data point you want to attach a
      value to.

      2. From the Chart menu, choose Attach Text.

      3. Click the OK button; the value is now attached to the
      selected data point.

      For more information on adding attached text to charts, please
      refer to pages 473-475 of the "Microsoft Excel User's Guide" for
      version 3.0.
