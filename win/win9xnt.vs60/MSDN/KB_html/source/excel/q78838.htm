The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 3.0, 4.0, 4.0a, 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Excel for OS/2, version 3.0
<LI>Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, versions 3,0, 4.0, 5.0
</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When a legend is added to a chart in Microsoft Excel, a symbol and
series name is included for each series in the chart. In versions of
Microsoft Excel earlier than version 5.0, there is no built-in command to
exclude a series from displaying within the chart legend. However, the
method shown below will prevent a series from displaying within a legend.
<P>
NOTE: In Microsoft Excel version 5.0, you can select legend entries and
format, edit or remove them individually.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The legend pattern is the same as the pattern for the series it
represents. The series will not be visible in the legend or the chart
when:

<OL><P><LI>The border and area for the series are set to none.

<P><LI>The series name has been edited to be blank.
<P>
</OL>To display the series in the chart, but not in the legend, do the
following:

<OL><P><LI>Select the desired series.

<P><LI>From the Format menu, choose Patterns. Select None under both
   Border and Area. (Choose None under both Line and Marker if you are
   working with a Line or Scatter chart.) Choose OK. The series will
   now be invisible but will still be selected.

<P><LI>With the entire series still selected, press the RIGHT ARROW key
   on your keyboard to select the first data point in the series.

<P><LI>From the Format menu, choose Patterns and change the Border and
   Area (or Line and Marker) options to the desired pattern and
   border. Choose OK.

<P><LI>Repeat steps 3 and 4 for the remaining data points in the series.
<P>
</OL>At this point, the symbol is not visible in the legend even though the
series is visible in the chart. The following steps will remove the series
name from the legend:

<OL><P><LI>From the Chart menu, choose Edit Series.

<P><LI>Select the appropriate series from the Series box.

<P><LI>Enter ="" in the Name box. Choose OK.
<P>
</OL>The series name and data marker will no longer be visible in the legend;
however, the legend contains enough space for the series. There is no way
to "compress" the legend to ignore this space.
