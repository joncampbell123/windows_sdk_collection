The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, when you open a workbook that contains a dialog sheet,
the caption on the dialog sheet may be centered instead of left justified.
This behavior is unexpected, because dialog captions in Microsoft Windows
95 are left justified.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs when you open a workbook that was created in Microsoft
Excel version 5.0 for Windows. Normally, in Microsoft Excel version 7.0,
when you create a dialog sheet, the dialog caption is left justified. This
is consistent with the way that dialog box captions appear in Microsoft
Windows 95. However, when you open a workbook that was created in Microsoft
Excel version 5.0, if the workbook contains a dialog sheet, the dialog
caption on the dialog sheet is centered. This is the way that dialog
captions appear in Microsoft Excel version 5.0.
<P>
Note that when you run a dialog box in Microsoft Excel version 7.0, even if
the dialog box was created in version 5.0, the dialog box caption appears
left justified as expected. However, the caption on the dialog sheet
remains centered.
<P>
In Microsoft Excel version 5.0, the dialog caption is centered on the
dialog frame both when you edit a dialog sheet, as well as when you run a
dialog box.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
