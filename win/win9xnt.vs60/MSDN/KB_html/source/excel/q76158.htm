<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Right-aligned numbers that have been entered as text in a Lotus
worksheet will appear as normal number values when viewed in Microsoft
Excel. These numbers appear as normal in both the cell and the formula
bar.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When entering numbers as text in Excel, the format ="number" is used.
Lotus uses the format of 'number (number preceded by a single
quotation mark) for left-aligned text numbers and uses the format of
"number (number preceded by a double quotation mark) for right-aligned
text numbers. These numbers are then difficult to distinguish from
normal number values when viewed in Excel.
<P>
The same difficulty occurs when you choose Workspace from the Options
menu and select the Alternate Navigation Keys check box in Excel, and
then use Lotus methods to enter numbers into an Excel worksheet.
<P>
Alternate Navigation Keys is an option only available under Excel
version 3.0.
<P>
Problems will occur when attempting to chart these "numbers." A blank
chart will result. Also, if you enter a formula such as =SUM(Range)
(where "Range" includes numbers entered as text), the text numbers
will not be included in the total.
<P>
To determine whether numbers have been entered as text values or
number values, format your numbers with General Alignment (choose
Alignment from the Format menu). Right-aligned numbers are number
values. Left-aligned numbers are text values.
<P>
Another way to make this determination is to select a cell in question
and choose Show Info from the Window menu. Then, choose Value from the
Info menu. If the number following "Value:" in the resulting dialog
box is surrounded by quotation marks, it is text.
