The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, versions 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 5.0a
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0c
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you start Microsoft Excel, you may receive the following error
message:
<P>
<PRE>   The list and decimal separators specified by the system are identical.
   Substituting ';' for the list separator.

</PRE>Additionally, after you receive this error message, you may receive
the following error message when you enter a formula on your
worksheet:
<P>
<PRE>   Error in formula

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs if you change the Decimal Separator to a comma (,)
character in:

<UL><LI>the Numbers control panel in System 7.1

<LI>the Regional Settings control panel in Microsoft Windows 95
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE>
<LI>the International control panel in Microsoft Windows.
<P>
</UL>This behavior occurs because Microsoft Excel uses the comma character as
the list separator by default. If you change the Decimal Separator to a
comma character, this error message occurs because the Decimal Separator is
the same as the List Separator.
<P>
Note that you may also receive this error message if your Macintosh System
file is damaged.
<P>
If you use a comma in a formula on your worksheet after receiving the
"List and decimal separators are identical" error message described
above, you may receive the following error message
<P>
<PRE>   Error in formula

</PRE>This error message occurs because Microsoft Excel is using the semicolon
character (;) as the new list separator and does not recognize the comma
character in the formula.
<P>
Note that in Microsoft Excel, the Module General tab in the Options dialog
box displays the comma character as the default setting for the List
Separator value. You cannot change this value in the Options dialog box.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
To avoid receiving this error message in Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh,
use the Numbers control panel to select any of the following Number Format
options:
<P>
<PRE>   U.S.
   Australian
   British
   any of the Swiss formats

   NOTE: If you receive the error message when you start Microsoft Excel
         for the Macintosh with any of the formats listed above except for
         the British format, your System file may be damaged.

</PRE>To avoid receiving this error message in Microsoft Excel for Windows or
Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, change the list separator to a character
other than a comma, for example, a period in either:

<UL><LI>the Regional Settings control panel in Microsoft Windows 95
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE>
<LI>the International control panel in Microsoft Windows
<P>
</UL><h3>What to Do if You Have a Damaged Macintosh System File</h3>
 
<P>
If you have determined that the System file may be damaged, do the
following:

<OL><P><LI>Start your computer using your Disk Tools disk.

<P><LI>Move your System file from the System Folder on the hard drive to the
   Desktop.

<P><LI>After moving this file, copy the System file from the System Folder
   on the Disk Tools disk to the System folder on the hard drive.

<P><LI>Open and then close the System Folder on your hard drive. This
   confirms with your Macintosh that the System is still valid in this
   folder.

<P><LI>Eject the Disk Tools disk, and restart your computer.

<P><LI>Start Microsoft Excel.
<P>
</OL>This process will determine if the old System file has a damaged resource.
If the test is successful, and Microsoft Excel starts without an error
message, open the System file that you moved to the Desktop, and copy the
contents into the new System file in the System folder.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Macintosh System software uses three different number separator values:
List, Decimal, and Thousands. These values are set in a resource item
(INTL) in the System file. In System versions earlier than version 7.1, the
only way to change any of these number format values is to modify the
resource in the System file using a program such as ResEdit. This is also
true for Date and Time Formats. Note, however, that manually editing
resources is NOT recommended.
<P>
In Macintosh System version 7.1, you can use the Numbers control panel to
change the Decimal Separator, and the Thousands Separator values. However,
if you change the Decimal Separator value to a comma (,) character, you
receive the error message described above when you start Microsoft Excel.
