<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you click a control on a worksheet, its image becomes shaded (hash
marks) and the macro code that you assigned to the control may or may not
run. Additionally, when pointing to the ActiveX control, your mouse pointer
(cursor) changes to a four-way arrow.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when you move a worksheet that contains ActiveX
controls to a new workbook.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To correct this problem, save, close, and then open the workbook in which
you moved controls. When you open the new workbook, the controls will
work properly.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Excel 97 includes ActiveX controls that can be inserted into
your worksheet. These controls are located on the Control Toolbox
toolbar. However, when you move a worksheet containing these controls to
a new workbook, the controls will not behave correctly until you save and
close the workbook. When you open the workbook, the ActiveX controls will
behave correctly.
<P>
For additional information on using ActiveX controls, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
