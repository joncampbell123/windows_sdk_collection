<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>

Several of the drivers for the Microsoft Small Business Financial Manager
for Microsoft Excel (SBFM) have been updated. This article lists the
updated drivers, what is corrected in each updated driver, and the contents
of the Updated Drivers for the Microsoft Small Business Financial Manager
for Windows 95 Readme.txt.
<P>
The updated drivers are available on Microsoft's World Wide Web site on the
internet, Microsoft's ftp site, the Microsoft Network, and the Microsoft
Download Service.
<P>
NOTE: The drivers are not new additional drivers for the SBFM. The files
are updates to some of the drivers that shipped in the SBFM or in the
Additional Drivers disk.
<P>
<P><h2>INSTRUCTIONS FOR DOWNLOADING</h2>
 
<P>
The following file(s) are available for download from the Microsoft
Software Library:

<P>
<P><h3>The Updated Drivers</h3>
 
<P>
The following table lists the updated SBFM drivers, the dates of the
updated drivers, and whether the drivers shipped in the SBFM or the
Additional Drivers disk:
<P>
<PRE>   Driver           Date        Source of original driver
   -----------------------------------------------------

   Aapacc.dll       8/28/96     SBFM
   Aapbww.dll       8/20/96     Additional Drivers
   Aapgreat.dll     8/20/96     SBFM
   Aapmas90.dll     8/20/96     Additional Drivers
   Aapqbw.dll       8/20/96     Additional Drivers
   Qbdrivhk.dll     8/20/96     Additional Drivers

</PRE>The following sections describe what is fixed in each of the drivers listed
in the above table.
<P>
<P><h3>Aapacc.dll - Computer Associates ACCPAC Plus for MS-DOS, version 6.1</h3>
 
<P>
Department information was not being read properly. This problem has been
corrected.
<P>
<P><h3>Aapbww.dll - Businessworks for MS-DOS and Windows, version 9.0</h3>
 
<P>
Trailing white space on character strings was causing Profitability reports
in Microsoft Excel to crash. The fix assures that any trailing white space
is removed and all strings are NULL terminated.
<P>
<P><h3>Aapgreat.dll - Great Plains Accounting for MS-DOS, version 8.0</h3>
 
<P>
The company name was not being recognized. The search is now refined to get
the record that contains the company information.
<P>
<P><h3>Aapmas90.dll - M A S 90 Evolution/2 for MS-DOS, version 1.5</h3>
 
<P>
The system file that contains MAS90 company information was not being
processed correctly. The company file is now parsed to retrieve correct
company names and to display them.
<P>
<P><h3>Aapqbw.dll, Qbdrivhk.dll - Quickbooks for Windows version 3.1</h3>
 
<P>
There was a problem working with the Accounts Receivable/Accounts
Payable/Inventory analysis that is now fixed.

<P>
<PRE>   Driver           Date
   ---------------------

   Aapbww.dll       6/27/1996
   Aapgreat.dll     5/1/1996
   Aapmas90.dll     6/27/1996
   Aapqbw.dll       6/27/1996
   Qbdrivhk.dll     6/5/1996

</PRE><P><LI>Use the appropriate procedure for the driver you want to install.
<P>
</OL><h3>Businessworks for MS-DOS and Windows, version 9.0:</h3>
 
In Windows Explorer, copy the Aapbww.dll file to the Aap folder on your
computer's hard disk (usually the C:\Msoffice\Excel\Aap folder).
<P>
<P><h3>Computer Associates ACCPAC Plus for MS-DOS, version 6.1:</h3>
 
In Windows Explorer, copy the Aapacc.dll file to the Aap folder on your
computer's hard disk (usually the C:\Msoffice\Excel\Aap folder).
<P>
<P><h3>Great Plains Accounting for MS-DOS, version 8.0:</h3>
 
In Windows Explorer, copy the Aapgreat.dll file to the Aap folder on
your computer's hard disk (usually the C:\Msoffice\Excel\Aap folder).
<P>
<P><h3>M A S 90 Evolution/2 for MS-DOS, version 1.5:</h3>
 
In Windows Explorer, copy the Aapmas90.dll file to the Aap folder on
your computer's hard disk (usually the C:\Msoffice\Excel\Aap folder).
<P>
<P><h3>Quickbooks for Windows version 3.1:</h3>
 
In Windows Explorer, copy the Aapqbw.dll and Qbdrivhk.dll files from
to the Aap folder on your computer's hard disk (usually the
C:\Msoffice\Excel\Aap folder).
<P>
<P><h2>ISSUES YOU MAY ENCOUNTER WHEN YOU IMPORT DATA</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Businessworks for MS-DOS and Windows, version 9.0:</h3>
 
If you perform a prior period adjustment into a closed period for which
you are no longer saving detailed transactions, you will need to
re-import your accounting data instead of updating your accounting
data.
<P>
<P><h3>Quickbooks for Windows, version 3.1:</h3>
 
A. You must have Quickbooks installed on your computer, and the company
<PRE>   .QBW file to import must be in the same folder as the Quickbooks
   program files.

</PRE></OL>B. While importing data, Financial Manager will need to open Quickbooks
<PRE>   and perform certain actions in Quickbooks. You should not touch your
   keyboard or computer during this time when Quickbooks is open.

</PRE>C. In a What-If Scenario profitability analysis, the detail information
<PRE>   for any sales items entered into QuickBooks without a product code are
   placed into the N/A item in Financial Manager. In QuickBooks, the
   sales reports by customer only include those items with a product code.
   Therefore, the total sales value in the QuickBooks sales report by
   customer will not match the total sales value in the Financial
   Manager profitability analysis worksheet.

</PRE>D. In QuickBooks, the summary sales by item report includes sales tax
<PRE>   information. In Financial Manager, the profitability analysis
   worksheet does not include sales tax information. Therefore, the total
   sales revenue value in the QuickBooks summary sales by item report will
   not match the total sales value in the Financial Manager profitability
   analysis worksheet.

</PRE>E. The QuickBooks summary sales by item report does not include
<PRE>   inventory adjustments, but all Financial Manager reports and analysis
   worksheets do. Therefore, if you have made inventory adjustments, the
   QuickBooks summary sales by item report will not match all of the
   Financial Manager reports and analysis worksheets. Since the QuickBooks
   profit and loss statement does include inventory adjustments, those
   values will match the Financial Manager values.

</PRE><h3>SUPPORT</h3>

Small Business Financial Manager warranty support policy. Installing
