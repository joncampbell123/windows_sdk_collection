<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The "average growth rate" is a calculation used by financial investors to
determine the best investment over time given present value, future value,
and number of periods per year of an investment. This calculation can also
be referred to as an "annualized yield rate" or "average rate of return."
Note that an annualized rate is always consistent in that it results in
percent-per-year figures.
<P>
Microsoft Excel does not include an average growth rate function. However,
you can use the following formula for this calculation
<P>
<PRE>   =((FV/PV)^(1/n))^m-1

</PRE>where FV is future value, PV is present value, n is the number of
investment periods, and m is the periods per year factor.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Investors want a consistent method to judge investment options. There are
various optional terms given to a method of calculation to compare these
options. One popular term is "average growth rate," and two others are
"annualized yield rate" and "average rate of return."
<P>
The most important point is that the method returns consistent unit values.
All results should return an average annual percent-per-year figure. The
results can then be compared directly to determine the best choice of the
options considered. You can calculate this result in Microsoft Excel by
using the common yield formula and adding an average compensation factor.
<P>
<P><h3>Example 1</h3>
 
<P>
Assume an investment where FV= $120,000, PV=$10,000, n=120 months, and m=12
months/year.
<P>
<PRE>          AGR = ((120000/10000)^(1/120))^12 - 1   = 0.282089

          AGR = 28.21% per year

</PRE><h3>Example 2</h3>
 
<P>
Assume an investment where FV= $120,000, PV=$10,000, n=10 years, and m=1
year/year.
<P>
<PRE>          AGR = ((120000/10000)^(1/10))^1 - 1   = 0.282089

          AGR = 28.21% per year
