The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, versions 7.0, 7.0a
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0c
</UL>

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, when you size a control, such as a check box or
a button, located at the left or top edge of a worksheet, the control
moves off of the worksheet and you can no longer select the control
to size, move, or delete it.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs when you size a control that is positioned at
the far left or top edge of a worksheet, by moving the control
selection handles toward that edge of the worksheet. This causes the
control selection handles to disappear from the screen.
<P>
For example, if a check box is located at the far left edge of your
worksheet, and you drag the right side of the check box to the left
edge of the worksheet, the check box selection handles disappear, and
you can no longer select the check box to move, size or delete it.
<P>
Note that when you size a check box or option button control off of
the worksheet as described above, the box portion of the check box
control or the circle portion of the option button control are still
displayed on the screen (although you cannot select them).
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To select a control that has been moved off of the worksheet, do the
following:

<OL><P><LI>From the Edit menu, choose Go To.

<P><LI>Choose the Special button.

<P><LI>Under Select, choose Objects, and then choose OK.
<P>
</OL>If your worksheet contains multiple objects, press the TAB key until
the desired object is selected. The name of the object, such as Check
Box 2, is displayed in the name box when the object is selected. You
can now move, size, or delete the selected control.
<P>
Note that when only the box or button of the control is displayed on the
worksheet, and you delete the control, the object IS deleted; however, the
box or button may remain on the screen. This is a problem with the way your
screen displays the information: you can correct this behavior by
minimizing the worksheet or the application window, and then restoring the
window again.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft
products listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching
this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
