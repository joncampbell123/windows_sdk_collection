<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, when you use the Consolidate dialog box to consolidate
data on worksheets that are contained in the same workbook, if you choose
to display the left column labels, and you click the Create Links To
Source Data check box, summary labels in the left column display the name
of the workbook instead of the sheet name.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs because the Consolidate dialog box does not determine
that the consolidated data is contained on worksheets in the same workbook
and that the workbook name does not distinguish where the data is located.
<P>
For example, if you consolidate data from Sheet1 and Sheet2 in BOOK1, and
you click the Left Column check box (under Use Labels In) and the Create
Links To Source Data check box, the consolidated data may appear as
follows:
<P>
<PRE>   A1:         B1: BOOK1   C1: 1000
   A2:         B2: BOOK1   C2: 1000
   A3: sales   B3:         C3: 2000

</PRE><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this behavior, on each of the worksheets that you are
consolidating, create the local name sheet_title that refers to a cell that
contains the worksheet name or the title that you want to appear in the
consolidated data. To do this, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Select a worksheet that contains data that you want to consolidate.

<P><LI>In an empty cell on the worksheet, enter the worksheet name or any
   other title that you want to appear in the consolidated data.

<P><LI>Select the cell that contains the data that you entered in Step 2
   above.

<P><LI>On the Insert menu, click name, and then click Define. In the
   Names In Workbook box, type "SHEET1!sheet_title" (without the
   quotation marks) where SHEET1 is the name of the selected worksheet.

<P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
</OL>Repeat Steps 1 through 5 with each worksheet that contains data that
you want to consolidate.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the Consolidate dialog box, the Use Labels In check box allows
you to choose whether to use labels from the top row of the source areas,
from the left column, both, or neither. These check boxes are meaningful
only when you consolidate data by category. Multiple source areas must be
laid out and labeled identically for this option to work accurately. When
you consolidate data by category, be sure to include the category labels in
the source areas you select for your consolidation. Microsoft Excel
transfers these labels to the destination area for you.
<P>
The Create Links To Source Data check box creates links from the
destination area to the source areas when you consolidate data so that the
destination area will be automatically updated whenever the source data
changes. Microsoft Excel creates a linking formula for every cell and
inserts rows or columns into the destination area to hold the linking
formulas for each piece of source data. The destination area is then
grouped with linking formulas placed in hidden rows or columns subordinate
to positions or categories in the destination area.
