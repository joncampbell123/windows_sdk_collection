The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, when you use the Pick From List command to enter data
in a cell, if you select an item that has been entered as text (by
preceding the value with an apostrophe character), the item is entered as
a value, instead of as text.
<P>
For example, if you type the following in cell A1
<P>
<PRE>   '=Test

</PRE>and if you use the Pick From List command to enter this item in cell A2,
the item is entered as =Test (without the apostrophe) and cell A2 displays
the #NAME? error value because the name "Test" is not defined in the
workbook.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When you enter a value on your worksheet as text by preceding the value
with the apostrophe character, the value appears in the list of available
items when you use the Pick From List command. This behavior occurs with
numbers, dates, and formulas, which are items that normally don't appear in
this list. However, when you choose an item that has been entered as text
with the apostrophe character, the apostrophe is removed, and the item is
entered as a value (that is, as a number, date, or formula).
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
