The information in this article applies to:

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The AutoFill feature in Microsoft Excel can intelligently extend several
types of data. This article discusses the rules that AutoFill follows in
determining whether to fill a range with fixed values or to create a series
based on the original data selected.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Note that in Microsoft Excel version 5.0, you can customize AutoFill by
using a custom AutoFill list. For more information about using a custom
list with the AutoFill feature, query on the following words in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   custom and list and autofill

</PRE><h3>RULE 1</h3>
 
<P>
If Microsoft Excel identifies a series in your source selection,
AutoFill continues the series. If no series is identified, Microsoft
Excel fills the AutoFill selection with the values in your source
selection.
<P>
<P><h3>Example A - Rule 1</h3>
 
<P>
A1: 1
A2: 2
<P>
Selecting the range A1:A2 and dragging the fill handle to include the
range A1:A4 results in the series:
<P>
A1: 1
A2: 2
A3: 3
A4: 4
<P>
<P><h3>Example B - Rule 1</h3>
 
<P>
A1: 1
A2: 1
<P>
Selecting cells A1:A2 and dragging the fill handle to include the
range A1:A4 results in the filled selection since no series was
identified in the selection:
<P>
A1: 1
A2: 1
A3: 1
A4: 1
<P>
<P><h3>RULE 2</h3>
 
<P>
AutoFill creates a series from a single number if the source selection
is larger than one cell and the first or second cell contains text.
<P>
<P><h3>Example - Rule 2</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>A1: 1   B1: SALES

</PRE>Selecting the range A1:B1 and dragging the fill handle to include the
range A1:B4 results in:
<P>
<PRE>A1: 1   B1: SALES
A2: 2   B2: SALES
A3: 3   B3: SALES
A4: 4   B4: SALES

</PRE>Notice that in this case Microsoft Excel created a series from the
single number in cell A1.
<P>
<P><h3>RULE 3</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft Excel will not create or extend a series when the AutoFill
selection runs perpendicular to the existing series; the series will
only be created or extended in a row-wise or column-wise orientation.
<P>
<P><h3>Example  A - Rule 3</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>A1: 1   B1: 2

</PRE>Selecting the range A1:B1 and dragging the fill handle to include the
range A1:B4 results in:
<P>
<PRE>A1: 1   B1: 2
A2: 1   B2: 2
A3: 1   B3: 2
A4: 1   B4: 2

</PRE>In this case Microsoft Excel didn't create a series because the
existing series (1,2) ran row-wise while the AutoFill selection ran
column-wise.
<P>
<P><h3>Example B - Rule 3</h3>
 
<P>
If it is desired to extend the series with 3 and 4 in A2:B2 and 5 and
6 in A3:B3, the series pattern would have to be created first as
follows:
<P>
<PRE>A1: 1    B1: 2
A2: 3    B2: 4

</PRE>Selecting the range A1:B2 and dragging the fill handle to include the
range A1:B4 results in:
<P>
<PRE>A1: 1   B1: 2
A2: 3   B2: 4
A3: 5   B3: 6
A4: 7   B4: 8

</PRE>While this is not a single series (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8) but instead, two
series: (1,3,5,7) and (2,4,6,8), it mimics the effect of creating a
series that runs across and down.
