The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, version 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel version 5.0, you can use either the Visual Basic
Workbooks.OpenText command or the Microsoft Excel version 4.0 OPEN.TEXT
macro command to open a text file from a macro. Both commands are
equivalent to using the TextWizard to open a text file. However, setting
the Consecutive Delimiter argument for either of these commands will have
no effect in TextWizard.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in
Microsoft Excel for Windows version 5.0c.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you run a macro using either the Workbook.OpenText or OPEN.TEXT
command, the text file will be opened using the Consecutive Delimiter
setting that was last set in TextWizard manually. The Consecutive Delimiter
argument in the command in a macro is ignored.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
The following Visual Basic subroutine will, when run, turn on (or off)
the "Treat consecutive delimiters as one" check box in the Text Import
Wizard:
<P>
<PRE>Sub ToggleConsecDelims()

   'Toggles "Treat consecutive delimiters" setting. If off, this line
   'turns it on. If already on, this line turns it off.
   Application.SendKeys "%fofilelist.txt{enter}%d{enter}%r{esc}"

End Sub

</PRE>To use this subroutine, make sure that either
<P>
- the file FILELIST.TXT exists in the current directory
<P>
<PRE>  -or-

</PRE>- you replace the characters "filelist.txt" in the above subroutine
<PRE>  with the name of a text file located in the current directory. For
  example, you could use:

     Application.SendKeys "%fosample.txt{enter}%d{enter}%r{esc}"

  if SAMPLE.TXT is a text file located in the current directory.

</PRE>You can then run code containing the Workbooks.OpenText or OPEN.TEXT
commands.
