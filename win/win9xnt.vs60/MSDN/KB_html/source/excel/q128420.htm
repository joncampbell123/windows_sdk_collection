<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The following information discusses the Microsoft Excel version 5.0a
maintenance release.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Reasons for the Maintenance Release</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft created a maintenance release for Macintosh Excel because we are
committed to providing the best possible products and service to our
customers. Part of this commitment involves listening to customers'
comments and concerns. We are offering a maintenance release to address
issues our customers have brought to our attention. Specific areas of
improvement include:

<UL><LI>Faster loading and saving of files on the Power Macintosh. Although we
   are very proud of Microsoft Excel 5.0's performance on the Power
   Macintosh, we found that with some minor adjustments we were able to
   increase the performance in the areas of loading and saving files. This
   minor adjustment has to do with changing the buffer size and was
   something we discovered by working closely with Apple in our ongoing
   process of hand-tuning the product for enhanced performance.

<LI>It was discovered that under certain specific conditions, using the
   linking function in MS Excel 5.0 for the Macintosh did not work. The
   specific instance is a case were you are linking to files that are
   closed and on a disk with certain kinds of formatting. This problem will
   be corrected.
<P>
   For additional information, please see the following article(s) in the
   Microsoft Knowledge Base:

</PRE></UL><h3>Availability</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft Excel version 5.0a will be releasing to manufacturing sometime in
the first quarter of 1995. Once it is released, current users will be able
to get the updated disk set almost immediately. The "a" release will start
appearing on retail shelves as soon as current inventory is depleted.
<P>
<P><h3>Obtaining the Maintenance Release</h3>
 
<P>
If you are a current user of Microsoft Excel 5.0 for the Macintosh or
Power Macintosh, you can order the maintenance release directly from
Microsoft by calling the Microsoft Sales and Information Center at (800)
426-9400. Ask for the Microsoft Excel 5.0a for the Macintosh disk set.
<P>
<P><h3>Upgrading from Microsoft Office version 4.2</h3>
 
<P>
If you currently own Microsoft Office version 4.2, you should not install
one of the standalone Microsoft Office applications, such as Microsoft
Excel version 5.0a. Mixing a standalone application's Setup with the
integrated Microsoft Office Setup is not recommended, and will most likely
cause problems.
