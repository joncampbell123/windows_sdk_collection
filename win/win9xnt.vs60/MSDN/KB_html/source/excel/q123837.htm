The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, version 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In a Microsoft Excel line chart or xy (scatter) chart, the primary or
secondary y axis scale may appear to have an incorrect maximum value, even
though each series plotted on the affected axis is still scaled
appropriately.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The y axis of a line chart or xy (scatter) chart will plot an
incorrect maximum value under the following conditions:

<UL><LI>The chart contains a secondary y axis.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>A series on the unaffected y axis (the one with the correct axis scale
   values) has smoothed line formatting and that same series also plots
   values greater than any other series on the affected y axis.
<P>
</UL><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem in Microsoft Excel 5.0, manually set the
maximum value of the affected scale with the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Make sure the chart is active.

<P><LI>Select the y axis that is being affected and choose Selected
   Axis from the Format menu.

<P><LI>In the Format Axis dialog box, choose the Scale tab, and type the
   desired maximum value in the Maximum edit box. Press OK.
<P>
</OL>The affected axis will now display the specified scale.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Excel version
5.0 for Windows. This problem was corrected in Microsoft Excel version 5.0c
for Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In a line or xy (scatter) chart, a series can be formatted as a smooth line
and it can also be formatted to appear on a secondary y axis. In addition,
if you have multiple series plotted on the chart, and they are not of like
numerical sequences, one or more of the series can be moved to the
secondary axis to show two different axis scales on a single chart. Under
certain conditions, one of the y axis scales will display an incorrect
maximum value.
<P>
When you create a chart containing a secondary y axis, both y axes
are plotted on separate scales. For example, if the first series plots
percentages from 0-100% and the second series plots sales values from
$1,000-$50,000, the primary axis could display the percentage values
and the secondary axis could display the sales values, or vice versa.
