                               ========

</PRE>This is one of two Application Notes designed to help you use Q+E and
Microsoft Excel together to efficiently manipulate your data. This
Application Note covers the most commonly asked questions about Q+E.
Another Application Note, "A Practical Guide to Using Q+E, Part II"
(WE0821), provides additional examples and contains answers to
specific questions about a variety of Q+E issues. Both Application
Notes assume that you know how to use Microsoft Excel and that you
have a high-level of understanding of the Microsoft Excel macro
language.
<P>
We know that this document may not answer all your questions about
Q+E. Therefore, we have tried to provide some general examples that
you can adapt to your particular situation. When necessary, specific
instructions will be given to allow for differences in database
drivers.

                             INTRODUCTION
                             ============

</PRE>Q+E manipulates database files through the use of database drivers.
These drivers emulate the particular database management system (DBMS)
used. These drivers have been designed to provide all the features of
your DBMS; however, they will be restricted by the limitations of your
system. For example, if your DBMS does not support the use of the
Structured Query Language (SQL) WHERE clause, Q+E won't provide
support for it either.
<P>
This Application Note will be the most useful if you are already
familiar with the features and limitations of the DBMS you use. If you
are not familiar with your DBMS, we recommend that you consult your
DBMS manual or contact its manufacturer for support.
<P>
<P><h2>CONVENTIONS USED IN THIS DOCUMENT</h2>
 
<P>
Whenever possible, this document uses the sample files located in the
QE subdirectory of your Microsoft Excel directory (EMP.DBF, LOC.DBF,
ADDR.DBF, DEPT.DBF). If you have removed these files from your hard
disk, you may want to reinstall Q+E so you can complete the examples
later in this document. In this Application Note, you will be
instructed to construct database files and to study examples that
build on those used in previous sections. It is important that you
perform all the examples in the same order as they appear in this
Application Note, because the results of some examples will be the
starting data for examples in later sections.
<P>
Many examples in this Application Note use single quotation marks (')
and double quotation marks ("); be sure to note this distinction as
you study these examples. The following is a sample of the format that
will be used for examples in this Application note:
<P>
<PRE>   =EXECUTE(chan,"[logon('SQLServer')]")


                         HOW Q+E USES DRIVERS
                         ====================

</PRE>Q+E drivers are designed to emulate a number of database systems. Q+E
can use these drivers to query these different kinds of systems. In
Q+E, when you choose an option from a menu or enter an SQL query, Q+E
sends an equivalent query to the driver that can communicate with the
particular DBMS you are attempting to access. For example, the
ExcelFile driver can read the binary interchange file format (BIFF)
used by Microsoft Excel, the dBASEFile driver can read dBASE(R)-
compatible files, and so forth.
<P>
<P><h2>SYSTEMS THAT Q+E DRIVERS SUPPORT</h2>
 
<P>
Q+E can use drivers to provide direct support for the following DBMSs:
<P>
<PRE>   dBASE Files
   Text Files
   Microsoft SQL Server
   ORACLE(R)
   OS/2(R) Extended Edition
   Microsoft Excel Files
   Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC(TM)) RDB

</PRE>NOTE: If your DBMS is not listed here, please read the "Using Q+E with
Other Database Systems" section of this Application Note to see if Q+E can
access your data some other way.
<P>
In Q+E, you can specify which driver to use by selecting it from the
Source list in the dialog box that appears when you choose Open from
the File menu. Some drivers will not be available as sources until you
have logged on.
<P>
NOTE: The TextFile, dBASEFile, and ExcelFile drivers will never be
listed in the Logon dialog box because Q+E can access these file types
from your hard disk.
<P>
<P><h3>To specify a driver by selecting it in the Sources list</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>From the File menu, choose Logon to display a list of the installed
   drivers you can log on to.

<P><LI>Select the driver you want to use, and choose the OK button.
<P>
</OL>Once you choose the source to log on to, you will be prompted for the
server name, login ID (user name), and password. If these identifiers
are accepted by the database system, the driver will appear in the
Source list box when you choose Open from the File menu.
<P>
The driver, or source, you select is responsible for parsing each
query sent from Q+E, translating it into the language understood by
the database system, and returning the results to Q+E. The best method
for this process depends on the type of database you are accessing.
<P>
<P><h3>dBASE</h3>
 
<P>
Q+E can read, modify, save, and create dBASE II-, III-, and IV-
compatible files and indexes. Appendix A of the "Q+E for Microsoft
Excel User's Guide" (page 115 for version 4.0 and page 124 for version
3.0) describes in detail the features supported by Q+E. This appendix
implies that the features described are unique to dBASE-compatible
files. This compatibility information is only partially true: many of
the concepts and syntax for the nonunique features in dBASE are
supported by most of the other Q+E database drivers. The dBASE
features will probably work on your system even if it's not a dBASE
system.
<P>
<P><h3>Text</h3>
 
<P>
Q+E can read and create a variety of text files. These files include
files with tab-separated values (these files should have the filename
extension .TXT), and comma-separated values (filename extension .CSV).
For more information about text files, see the appendix in the "Q+E
for Microsoft Excel User's Guide" that describes using text files.
When you use text files, several different options are available; the
appendix describes many of the most popular options.
<P>
<P><h3>SQL Server</h3>
 
<P>
SQL Server is a client-server-based system where the actual data, as
well as the procedures for accessing that data, are stored on a
server. A variety of front end (client) applications, including Q+E,
can communicate with the server because both the front-end and the
server understand the SQL language.
<P>
When a front end needs to access the server, it must create a channel
of communication called a named pipe. Named pipes are not supported by
all network systems, and on many systems that do offer support for
them, the support was not available at the time of the original
network installation. If you receive this message:
<P>
<PRE>   Network Communication Layer Not Loaded

</PRE></OL>either your network does not support named pipes, or the support has
not been installed correctly. Networks that are compatible with
Microsoft's LAN Manager versions 2.0 and later include a file called
NETAPI.DLL. Once this file is installed, you should no longer receive
the above error message.
<P>
An example of a network that only recently has begun offering named
pipe support is Novell(R). If you are using Novell NetWare(R), you may
need to contact an authorized Novell reseller for a NETAPI.DLL file
developed for Novell NetWare. If you are certain that you have
correctly installed the NETAPI.DLL file and you continue to get error
messages, verify that the directory in which you installed the file is
listed in the PATH statement, and that your PATH statement is not too
long or otherwise invalid. If you continue to have difficulties, you
may want to contact Novell support for more information about
installing named pipe support.
<P>
<P><h3>ORACLE</h3>
 
<P>
In order to access ORACLE, you must have a number of environmental
variables defined (these are set in the AUTOEXEC.BAT or other batch
file), and you must run SQLNTB.EXE before you start Microsoft Windows.
SQLNTB.EXE is an ORACLE file that can be obtained by contacting Oracle
Corporation. Be sure to check the documentation for further
information if problems persist. The maximum number of logons to
ORACLE allowed at one time per Q+E session is two.
<P>
<P><h3>OS/2 Extended Edition</h3>
 
<P>
IBM(R)'s OS/2 Extended Edition (EE) databases can currently be
accessed only by the 3.0 version of Q+E with Microsoft Excel 3.0 on
OS/2 1.3. OS/2 2.0 has not been tested with any versions of Microsoft
Excel or Q+E.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Excel</h3>
 
<P>
Q+E can open Microsoft Excel versions 2.x, 3.0, 4.0, and 4.0a files if
your Microsoft Excel file contains a defined database. Q+E can neither
edit nor define a database in Microsoft Excel; however, Q+E can save
the results of a query as a new Microsoft Excel worksheet file. For
more information about accessing Microsoft Excel files, please see the
appropriate appendix in the "Q+E for Microsoft Excel User's Guide."
<P>
<P><h3>Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) RDB</h3>
 
<P>
If you have Microsoft Excel version 4.0 or 4.0a, the RDB driver is
installed during the normal installation of Microsoft Excel and Q+E.
If you have Microsoft Excel version 3.x or earlier, the DEC RDB driver
is available for Q+E for Windows only through a special release of
Microsoft Excel, available by calling Microsoft Sales and Information
at (800) 426-9400. There are no references to DEC RDB in the "Q+E for
Microsoft Excel User's Guide." However, documentation has been
provided in the READMEQE.TXT file included with the special release.
The Application Note "Q+E, Advanced Topics" (WE0821) also contains
some information about using the RDB database.
<P>
To use the DEC RDB driver to access an RDB database, you must first
install and run DECnet(TM) services to connect to the data. See your DEC
RDB database administrator or RDB manual for details, or contact
Digital Equipment Corporation for the proper DECnet files.
<P>
Most problems that occur when you connect with RDB can be traced to an
invalid schema statement. The schema statement cannot include
logicals, and the entire sentence must be spelled out as in the
following example:
<P>
<PRE>   declare schema filename 'sys$sysdevice:[dbk$personnel]personnel'

   disk name : sys$sysdevice:
   directory name : [dbk$personnel]
   database name : personnel

</PRE><h2>USING Q+E WITH OTHER DATABASE SYSTEMS</h2>
 
<P>
If Q+E does not have a driver to access your DBMS directly, you may be
able to access your data indirectly. That is, if your DBMS can save
the data in one of the formats that Q+E can read, you can probably
access it with Q+E.
<P>
There are two other database systems groups: those whose files can be
saved as dBASE- or Microsoft Excel-compatible files, and those whose
files can be saved only in text file format. Consult your DBMS manual
or manufacturer to see if your system fits one of these groups.
<P>
<P><h3>Accessing Data from dBASE- or Microsoft Excel-Compatible Files</h3>
 
<P>
Many DBMSs can save data as dBASE-compatible files. A few can save
data as Microsoft Excel-compatible files. If your system supports one
of these options, consult the manual for instructions on saving in
this format. After saving the file in a Q+E-compatible format, attempt
to open it in Q+E. If Q+E recognizes the format, the file will be
opened, and you will be able to manipulate your data. If Q+E cannot
recognize the format, an error similar to the following may be
produced
<P>
<PRE>   Invalid file format: c:\&lt;filename&gt;

</PRE>where &lt;filename&gt; is the name of the file you are trying to access.
<P>
<P><h3>Accessing Data from Text Files</h3>
 
<P>
Most DBMSs can also save database information in a text file format.
Q+E can recognize character-
delimited files (every field is separated by a character, such as a
comma or an asterisk) or fixed-format files (every field is the same
number of characters wide). Check your DBMS manual to see if either of
these options is available to you. Remember that Microsoft Excel and
Q+E work as a team: if one application cannot read your file format,
try opening it in the other. Once your file is open, you can save the
data in a format the other application can read.
<P>
<P>
<PRE>                 SPECIFYING THE DEFAULT DRIVER FOR Q+E
                 =====================================

</PRE>You can set the default database driver (the driver that will appear
when you choose Open from the File menu) by modifying the CONNECT=
line in your Q+E initialization file. This line indicates which driver
will be selected in Q+E when you open a file. The following is an
example of the sections of the initialization file as they appear
immediately after Q+E is installed (in this example, the dBASEFile
driver was selected as the default database driver):
<P>
<PRE>   [SQLCONNECT]
   ExcelFile=QEXLS
   SQLServer=QESS
   dBASEFile=QEDBF
   TextFile=QETXT

   [Q+E]
   connect=dBASEFile
   NoLogon=dBASEFile,TextFile,ExcelFile
   Maximized=1

</PRE>To select a default driver other than the one you selected during
installation:

<OL><P><LI>In a text editor (such as Windows Notepad), open the Q+E
   initialization file.
<P>
   NOTE: The date of QE.EXE determines where your Q+E initialization
   file will be located. The QE.EXE file dated 12/09/90 uses the WIN.INI
   file for initialization. Versions of QE.EXE for Windows dated later
   than 12/09/90 use the QE.INI file that is placed in your Windows
   directory during installation.

<P><LI>Delete the text after CONNECT=, and insert the name of another
   valid driver.
<P>
   Valid driver names are listed in the [SQLCONNECT] section of your
   initialization file. For example, if you usually open Microsoft
   Excel files in Q+E, you might want to change the CONNECT=DBASEFILE
   line to CONNECT=EXCELFILE, as follows:
<P>
<P><PRE>      [Q+E]
      connect=ExcelFile
      NoLogon=dBASEFile,TextFile,ExcelFile
      Maximized=1
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: You cannot specify a driver this way with Q+E for OS/2,
   because the initialization files are binary. To change the default
   driver under OS/2, you must reinstall Q+E.
<P>
   If your QE.EXE file is dated earlier than to 4/2/92, you must
   restart Windows for this change to take effect. If your QE.EXE file
   is dated 4/2/92 or later, you must restart Q+E for your changes to
   take effect.
<P>
<P>
<PRE>                           WHAT IS A QUERY?
                           ================

</PRE></OL>A query is the process of creating a request in the language of the
DBMS you are accessing, and sending that request to the system. The
query is processed by the DBMS, and the results, whether data or a
confirmation of a change, are sent back to the front end that made the
query.
<P>
Q+E offers two ways for you to query the data in your DBMS: you can
use the menu commands, or you can enter an SQL query manually. SQL is
a standard language used by many database systems and front ends for
manipulating and viewing data.
<P>
<P><h3>To use the menu commands to enter a query</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>In Q+E, choose Open from the File menu.

<P><LI>Select the source (for example, select dBASEFile).

<P><LI>Choose a file (such as the sample file ADDR.DBF in the QE
   subdirectory), and choose OK.
<P>
</OL><h3>To enter a query manually</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>From the File menu, choose Open.

<P><LI>Select the source dBASEFile.

<P><LI>Choose the SQL button.

<P><LI>Type the following and choose OK:
<P>
<P><PRE>      select * from c:\excel\qe\ADDR.DBF
</PRE><P>
</OL>The Q+E manual contains some simple examples of SQL statements and the
"A Practical Guide to Q+E, Part II" Application Note (WE0821)
describes the most common SQL terms. If you need to create more
complicated queries, we recommend that you purchase a third-party
reference guide to supplement this information.
<P>
<P>
<PRE>   USING QE.XLA (THE MICROSOFT EXCEL ADD-IN MACRO FOR ACCESSING Q+E)
   =================================================================

</PRE></OL><h2>THE ADD-IN QE.XLA MACRO FUNCTIONS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use QE.XLA, several commands are added to the Data menu.
These commands are supported by corresponding custom macro functions
that allow you to create command macros with the same functionality as
the menu commands. Keep in mind that the macro functions QE.XLA
supports, such as DB.LOGON() and DB.SQL.QUERY(), rely on QE.XLA;
therefore, QE.XLA must be open in order for your macro to run.
<P>
TIP: You may want to comment your macro to indicate that in order for
the macro to run correctly, the user must have QE.XLA loaded; or, you
may want to include code that checks whether QE.XLA is loaded.
<P>
If you use Microsoft Excel version 4.0 or 4.0a, use the Add-in Manager
to automatically add the Q+E items to the Data menu:

<OL><P><LI>From the Options Menu, choose Add-Ins.

<P><LI>Choose the Add button and select QE.XLA (this file should be
   located in the QE subdirectory in the directory in which you
   installed Microsoft Excel).

<P><LI>Choose OK.
<P>
</OL>-or-
<P>
If you are using Microsoft Excel version 3.0, place the QE.XLA file in
your XLSTART subdirectory in order to automatically load Q+E when you
start Microsoft Excel.
<P>
<PRE>   NOTE: You can also open QE.XLA by choosing Open from the File menu
   and choosing QE.XLA from the list of files to open. Once QE.XLA is
   loaded, the Paste Fieldnames, SQL Query, and Activate Q+E commands
   are added to the Data menu. When you choose Set Database, you will
   also see the new option External. These commands are explained in
   the  Q+E for Microsoft Excel User's Guide.

</PRE></OL><h2>JOINING MULTIPLE EXTERNAL DATABASES</h2>
 
<P>
QE.XLA will enable you to extract information from multiple external
database tables. For example, you might want to extract the employee
database information for all managers listed in the department
database. Each manager has an ID number that is identical in both
databases. You can use the ID number to establish a relationship
between the two database tables. In addition, you could add criteria
to find only the records for all managers who are located in
departments L31 or L04, have a salary of $48,000 or more, and
were hired after January 1, 1985.
<P>
For more information, see pages 15-18 of the "Q+E for Microsoft Excel
User's Guide" for version 4.0, or pages 16-18 of the "Q+E for
Microsoft Excel User's Guide" for version 3.0.
<P>
<P><h3>Example of Using Criteria to Join Two Database Tables</h3>
 
<P>
To view a sample document that demonstrates how to join tables and set
criteria, do the following to create a worksheet that has external
database definitions and extract ranges:

<OL><P><LI>From Microsoft Excel, start QE.XLA.

<P><LI>On a new worksheet, choose Set Database from the Data menu, select
   External, and choose OK.

<P><LI>In the Set External Database dialog box, select the QE directory,
   and then select the DEPT.DBF file, choose OK, and choose Add.

<P><LI>Select the EMP.DBF file, choose OK, choose Add, and then choose OK
   again.

<P><LI>From the Data menu, choose Paste Fieldnames, and choose the Paste
   All button.
<P>
</OL><h3>Example of Joining Two External Database Tables</h3>
 
<P>
The files EMP.DBF and DEPT.DBF have common data in one of their
fields. In EMP.DBF, this field is called EMP_ID, and in DEPT.DBF, this
field is called MGR_ID. These fields represent the same data but have
different field names. To join information from these two tables, you
must specify this relationship in a criteria range. To extract the
joined records, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>In cells N1 and N2, type the following:
<P>
<PRE>         |     N
   --------------------
      1  | dept.MGR_ID
      2  | emp.EMP_ID

   This criteria can be translated as follows: for every manager ID
   number in DEPT.DBF, find the corresponding ID number and record in
   EMP.DBF.

</PRE><P><LI>Select the range N1:N2 and choose Set Criteria from the Data menu.

<P><LI>Copy the data in cell N1 and paste it into cell N3.

<P><LI>From the Data menu, choose Extract.

<P><LI>When Microsoft Excel reports that four records are found, choose
   the Paste button.
<P>
<P>
   USING DYNAMIC DATA EXCHANGE COMMANDS WITH Q+E AND MICROSOFT EXCEL
   =================================================================
<P>
</OL>In addition to QE.XLA, you can use dynamic data exchange (DDE) macro
commands to communicate between Microsoft Excel and Q+E. DDE is
basically a set of rules supported by the operating system (either
Windows or OS/2) that an application must follow in order to
communicate with another application. An application that supports DDE
can manipulate another DDE application to perform such tasks as
printing or querying. Not all applications support DDE, but both
Microsoft Excel and Q+E do.
<P>
A DDE conversation requires two participants: a client to initiate
communication and send commands, and a server to execute and respond
to those commands. An application can be a client, a server, or both,
depending on how the application is designed. Microsoft Excel is both
a DDE client and server, but Q+E has been designed to function as a
DDE server only; therefore, when you use DDE with Microsoft Excel and
Q+E, Microsoft Excel is the client, and Q+E is the server.
<P>
Communicating with Q+E from Microsoft Excel can be challenging because
you must understand the capabilities and requirements of Q+E, the
syntax and limitations of Microsoft Excel's macro language, and the
basics of DDE. Hopefully, the following information will address many
of the issues you may encounter when you create Microsoft Excel macros
to communicate with Q+E.
<P>
<P><h2>PREPARING TO COMMUNICATE THROUGH DDE</h2>
 
<P>
Stable communication between applications through DDE may be
influenced by many factors, including the PATH or LIBPATH environment
variables and support files, and the number of available system
resources.
<P>
<P><h3>PATH or LIBPATH Environment Variables and Support Files</h3>
 
<P>
One of the most important factors in DDE communication is the PATH
environment variable for MS-DOS and the PATH and LIBPATH environment
variables for OS/2. For OS/2 systems, these variables are set in your
CONFIG.SYS file. The PATH variable for MS-DOS systems is set in your
AUTOEXEC.BAT file. Both Microsoft Excel and Q+E require a number of
support files for proper operation, and unexpected results may occur
if the operating system cannot find these critical files. It is very
important that the EXCEL directory appear in the PATH and/or LIBPATH
statements. For more information about these variables, please consult
your MS-DOS or OS/2 documentation.
<P>
<P><h3>Number of Available System Resources</h3>
 
<P>
Another important factor for DDE communication is the amount of free
system resources. In general, the term "system resources" is used to
describe the environment an application must operate in. System
resources are a conglomeration of many factors, both free or in use,
such as memory, the number of applications, graphical items in use
(icons, buttons, scroll bars, window borders, and so forth), and open
DDE channels.
<P>
Windows reports the amount of system resources available when you
choose About from the Help menu in Program Manager. There is no way to
check the amount of system resources available in OS/2, but, generally
speaking, OS/2 has a larger amount of system resources available than
Windows does.
<P>
The maximum amount of system resources is available when the system is
restarted and no applications are running. You can determine how many
applications are running by bringing up the Task List (press
CTRL+ESC). The Task List displays all running applications and allows
you to close those you don't need, freeing system resources.
<P>
At times you may find that the DDE channel becomes unstable, performs
poorly or slowly, or returns incorrect results. When this happens, we
recommend that you shut down your system, restart it, and reopen your
applications. Sometimes the system itself may become unstable; when
this occurs, you will need to restart your system.
<P>
USING DDE COMMAND FUNCTIONS TO GET Q+E
<P><h2>AND MICROSOFT EXCEL TO TALK TO ONE ANOTHER</h2>
 
<P>
A number of functions are available for communicating between
applications through DDE. Although a DDE command name may vary among
applications, its purpose remains the same. Because Microsoft Excel is
the DDE client and is manipulating Q+E, we will look at the following
five client DDE command functions available in Microsoft Excel:
<P>
<PRE>   Function    |  Description
</PRE></OL> 
<PRE>   INITIATE()  |  Opens a DDE conversation
   TERMINATE() |  Closes a DDE conversation
               |
   REQUEST()   |  Requests information from the server
   POKE()      |  Sends information to the server
               |
   EXECUTE()   |  Tells the server to perform some known function

</PRE>The examples included in later sections of this Application Note will
use these functions. For more information about these functions and
what they do, please refer to their descriptions in the "Function
Reference" and Chapter 10 of the "Q+E for Microsoft Excel User's
Guide."
<P>
<P><h2>OPENING AND CLOSING THE DDE CHANNEL</h2>
 
<P>
An application must be running before it will respond to a request to
open a DDE channel. In Microsoft Excel, there are two functions that
start an application: INITIATE() and EXEC(). The best way to start Q+E
from a Microsoft Excel macro is with the INITIATE() function, as in
the following example:
<P>
<PRE>   =INITIATE("QE","System")

</PRE>INITIATE() will attempt to open a channel of communication with
another application. If that application is not already running, you
will be prompted to start it with the following message:
<P>
<PRE>   Remote data not accessible. Start application "Q+E.EXE"?

</PRE>If you choose Yes, Q+E will start, and the DDE channel will open.
<P>
TIP: If you do not want to see the above error message, you can turn
Microsoft Excel's error checking off. Be sure to turn error checking
on again right after the INITIATE() function--turning error checking
off turns off all of Microsoft Excel's warning messages. For example,
use the following commands:
<P>
<PRE>   =ERROR(FALSE)
   =INITIATE("QE","System")
   =ERROR(TRUE)

</PRE>If Q+E is already running and the INITIATE() function is successful, a
DDE channel will be opened, and the unique DDE channel identifier
returned. It is often convenient to create a variable that will hold
the DDE channel identifier. For example, the following statements are
equivalent:
<P>
<PRE>   chan=INITIATE("QE","SYSTEM")

   =SET.NAME("chan",INITIATE("QE","SYSTEM"))

</PRE>Both of these statements create a variable "chan" and assign it the
value returned by the INITIATE() function. The name "chan" can now be
referred to in other macro statements to represent the DDE channel
that was just opened.
<P>
Opening a DDE channel consumes valuable system resources. Therefore,
to free system resources for other functions, close every DDE channel
by using a TERMINATE() function. (Note that every example in this
Application Note that contains an INITIATE() function will also
contain a TERMINATE() function). For example, use the following macro
to open a DDE channel and then immediately close it:
<P>
<PRE>   chan=INITIATE("QE","SYSTEM")
   =TERMINATE(chan)
   =RETURN()

</PRE>You can insert any query or data manipulation statements between the
INITIATE() and TERMINATE() functions.
<P>
Although you can also use the Microsoft Excel EXEC() function to open
an application, if the application is already open, you will receive
the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   &lt;Application Name&gt; is already running!

</PRE>For this reason, you should not use the EXEC() function to open an
application that may already be running.
<P>
<P><h3>Tips for Using the INITIATE() Function with Q+E</h3>
 
<P>
To use Q+E efficiently, think of some of the DDE macro functions as
opposites that you can use in pairs. For example, the TERMINATE()
function performs the opposite of INITIATE(). Because Q+E has a limit
of 64 DDE channels, you shouldn't use the INITIATE() function without
using the TERMINATE() function. When more than 64 DDE channels to Q+E
have been opened, you may receive the following error, even though Q+E
is open:
<P>
<PRE>   Remote data not accessible. Start application 'QE.EXE'?

</PRE>If this happens while you are running your DDE macros, shut down your
system, restart it, and then make sure you use a TERMINATE() function
for each DDE channel you have initiated.
<P>
The REQUEST() and POKE() functions can also be used as pair, although
you do not have to use them this way. These functions request or send
data between applications. The macro example in the "Q+E for Microsoft
Excel User's Guide" (at the bottom of page 73 in both versions 3.0 and
4.0), allows you to retrieve data from Q+E, manipulate it in Microsoft
Excel, and then return it to Q+E.
<P>
<P>
<PRE>                   USING THE DDE EXECUTE() FUNCTION
                   ================================

</PRE>The EXECUTE() function is the workhorse of DDE. It allows the client
to manipulate the server to perform whatever function you want.
EXECUTE() also has some very special syntax requirements that will be
described later in this Application Note. You can trace most problems
in DDE macros to incorrect EXECUTE() command syntax.
<P>
<P><h2>USING SIMPLE EXECUTE() FUNCTIONS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Excel can send any Q+E command to Q+E using the EXECUTE()
function. For a complete description of all the Q+E EXECUTE()
commands, refer to Chapter 11 of the "Q+E for Microsoft Excel User's
Guide."
<P>
EXECUTE() requires two parameters, channel_num and execute_text.
Channel_num is represented in the examples below by the defined name
"chan." The execute_text argument is a text string enclosed in
brackets and enclosed in double quotation marks; that is
"[server_command_to_execute]".
<P>
The following are several examples of simple EXECUTE() functions:
<P>
<PRE>   =EXECUTE(chan,"[logon('SQLServer')]")
   =EXECUTE(chan,"[allow.edit(TRUE)]")
   =EXECUTE(chan,"[open('select * from c:\excel\qe\EMP.DBF')]")
   =EXECUTE(chan,"[select.column('SALARY')]")
   =EXECUTE(chan,"[add.condition(1,3,30000,FALSE)]")
   =EXECUTE(chan,"[open('select * from c:\excel\qe\EMP.DBF where
   SALARY &lt; 30000')]")

</PRE>Note that each function should be entered as a single continuous line of
code.
<P>
Note also that all execute_text arguments are surrounded by brackets and
double quotation marks. These examples meet the requirements of the
corresponding Q+E commands as described in Chapter 11 of the "Q+E for
Microsoft Excel User's Guide." For example, the text string
<PRE>'SQLServer' is a valid parameter for the Q+E LOGON command (see page
</PRE>100 of the "Q+E for Microsoft Excel User's Guide").
<P>
Note that the third, fourth, and fifth functions in the examples above
can be combined into the sixth function. This point is best
illustrated by choosing these commands from the menus in Q+E and
looking at the resulting SQL query.
<P>
<P><h2>USING COMPLEX EXECUTE() FUNCTIONS</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>EXECUTE() and Concatenation</h3>
 
<P>
When you're using variables to represent values, EXECUTE() functions
with concatenation operators allow you more flexibility. Because the
second argument of the EXECUTE() function is a quoted text string, you
can concatenate two or more text fragments and create a valid
function.
<P>
For example, the following EXECUTE() statement without the
concatenation operator will open a query and will display all columns
and records from the ADDR.DBF sample database file:
<P>
<PRE>   =EXECUTE(chan,"[open('select * from c:\excel\qe\ADDR.DBF')]")

</PRE>However, by using the ampersand concatenation operator (&amp;), you can
break this statement into two text strings:
<P>
<PRE>   =EXECUTE(chan,"[open('select * from c:\excel\qe\"&amp;"ADDR.DBF')]")

</PRE>Note the syntax of this statement. The single text string has been
broken into two independent strings by using a double quotation mark
to complete the first text string:
<P>
<PRE>   "[open('select * from  c:\excel\qe\"

</PRE>Then the concatenation operator &amp; was used to combine the two strings.
Finally, the last text string was started with a double quotation mark
to make
<P>
<PRE>   "ADDR.DBF')]"

</PRE>an independent text string. This statement will be interpreted exactly
as the first, and the idea is easily expanded to use variables to
represent all or portions of these text segments. Now, with the
concatenation operator in place, if you ask the user to enter the
filename of his or her choice, you can use the variable FileName to
represent ADDR.DBF:
<P>
<PRE>   FileName=INPUT("Input a FileName (ADDR.DBF)",2)
   =EXECUTE(chan,"[open('select * from c:\excel\qe\"&amp;FileName&amp;"')]")

</PRE>Note that the concatenation operator (&amp;) is used with double quotation
marks (""). The syntax for concatenating a variable with a text string
is to use "&amp;variable_name&amp;", and the result is another text string.
The three EXECUTE() functions in this section will evaluate the
information the same way, but the last example allows more flexibility
by giving the user an opportunity to specify which file he or she
wants to use.
<P>
<P><h3>EXECUTE() and Variables in WHERE Clauses</h3>
 
<P>
The syntax of an EXECUTE() function becomes somewhat more complicated
when a variable is needed to represent a value in a WHERE clause. When
you execute DDE commands in Q+E, you are really trying to duplicate
the menu commands and the resultant SQL query. The following Q+E
procedure illustrates this point:

<OL><P><LI>In Q+E, open the dBASE file ADDR.DBF (this file should be located
   in the QE subdirectory).

<P><LI>Select the LAST_NAME column so that every last name is highlighted.

<P><LI>From the Select menu, choose Add Condition. The Column should be
   LAST_NAME, the Operator should be Equal, and the Value should be
   Bennett. Choose the OK button.
<P>
   At this point, only the record for Tyler Bennett should be visible.

<P><LI>From the Select menu, choose SQL Query, and note that the SQL query
   reads:
<P>
<P><PRE>      SELECT FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, EMP_ID, STREET, CITY, STATE, ZIP
      FROM C:\EXCEL\QE\ADDR.DBF
      WHERE LAST_NAME='Bennett'
</PRE><P>
   Note the single quotation marks around Bennett. To place single
   quotation marks around the name Bennett in a macro, use a DDE
   statement such as the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      =EXECUTE(chan,"[open('select * from ADDR.DBF
      where LAST_NAME = ''Bennett''')]")
</PRE><P>
   You use a pair of single quotation marks around the name to force
   Q+E to place one set of single quotation marks in the query. To
   have a user-defined variable LastName represent the name  "Bennett"
   would require a command macro such as the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      LastName=INPUT("Enter employee's last name (Bennett)",2)
      =EXECUTE(chan,"[open('select * from ADDR.DBF where
      LAST_NAME = ''"&amp;LastName&amp;"''')]")
</PRE><P>
   This step is not necessary for a WHERE clause that looks for a
   value as in the following example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      =EXECUTE(chan,"[open('select * from c:\excel\qe\EMP.DBF
      where SALARY &lt; 30000')]")
</PRE><P>
</OL>TIP: If you find that the variables in your WHERE clauses aren't
behaving as you expect, perform the same functions using the Q+E menu
command and look at the result in the SQL query window. When you
create your macro, duplicate exactly what is in that statement.
<P>
<P><h2>TROUBLESHOOTING FAILED EXECUTE() STATEMENTS</h2>
 
<P>
There are times when a properly constructed EXECUTE() function fails
because the menu command being emulated is unavailable (dimmed). For
example, the menu command Reset Sort is unavailable until you have
actually performed a sort on a query. The procedure that most
frequently fails is executing the SQL.QUERY command across a DDE
channel that has just been initiated. The following is an example of a
command that will fail:
<P>
<PRE>   chan=INITIATE("qe","system")
   =EXECUTE(chan,"[SQL.QUERY('select * from
   dBASEFile|c:\excel\qe\ADDR.DBF')]")
   =TERMINATE(chan)
   =RETURN()

</PRE></OL>To demonstrate why this command fails, close and restart Q+E, but do
not open any queries. Note that the only menus available are File and
Help. The SQL Query command is on the Select menu, and, therefore, it
is not available until you have actually opened a query. In Q+E, when
you want to enter an SQL query and there are no queries open, you must
choose the Open command from the File menu and select the SQL option.
This is exactly what you must do when you want to send a new  query
through DDE:
<P>
<PRE>   chan=INITIATE("qe","system")
   =EXECUTE(chan,"[OPEN('select * from
   dBASEFile|c:\excel\qe\ADDR.DBF')]")
   =TERMINATE(chan)
   =RETURN()

</PRE>Once you have a query open, you can send the SQL.QUERY command:
<P>
<PRE>   chan=INITIATE("qe","system")
   =EXECUTE(chan,"[OPEN('select * from
   dBASEFile|c:\excel\qe\ADDR.DBF')]")
   =EXECUTE(chan,"[SQL.QUERY('select * from
   ExcelFile|c:\excel\qe\EMP.XLS')]")
   =TERMINATE(chan)
   =RETURN()

</PRE><h2>DDE LIMITATIONS</h2>
 
<P>
When you are using DDE to transfer information from Microsoft Excel to
Q+E, be aware of the following three limitations:

<OL><P><LI>Your data cannot contain more than 127 characters per item or
   topic.
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Both the topic and the item in a DDE link are limited to a length
      of 127 characters.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - The topic is the information that defines the "subject" of a DDE
      conversation and represents some unit of data that is meaningful
      to the DDE server conversation. For most applications that
      manipulate files on disk, the topic is a filename (for example,
      SALES.QEF).
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - The item is a reference to a piece of data (such as an integer, a
      string, or a range of cells in a query) that can be passed between
      two applications engaged in a DDE conversation.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - In the following example, QE is the application, SELECT
      FIRST_NAME...EMP.DBF is the item, and R1C1:R1C1 is the topic:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>         =QE|'SELECT FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, EMP_ID, HIRE_DATE,
         SALARY, DEPT, EXEMPT, INTERESTS FROM
         dBASEFile|C:\EXCEL\QE\EMP.DBF'!'R1C1:R1C1'

            NOTE: The above sample macro code should be entered as one
            single line of code.

</PRE><P><LI>Your data cannot contain more than 225 characters per cell.
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Assuming that your topic and item are fewer than 128 characters,
      the only size limitation is the 255-character limit per cell in
      Microsoft Excel. Microsoft Excel does not allow you to enter a
      formula longer than 255 characters. This can be a problem when you
      are sending large queries and other DDE instructions to Q+E.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - Q+E does provide the COMMAND() function, which buffers a DDE
      command received from another application in chunks. For example,
      you could send a long SQL query from Microsoft Excel using the
      COMMAND() function by dividing the query into sections 100 to 200
      characters long. Each section can be sent separately to Q+E, which
      concatenates the sections and executes your request.
</PRE>
<P><LI>You cannot open more than 64 channels per instance of Microsoft
   Excel.
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Q+E allows an application to create only 64 channels. However,
      each channel does use a small amount of system resources, so it is
      possible that you will run out of system resources while opening
      DDE channels.

Practical Guide to Q+E, Part II" Application Note (WE0821).

<P>
<PRE>                USING MICROSOFT EXCEL AND Q+E TOGETHER
                ======================================

</PRE></OL><h2>GETTING DATA FROM Q+E TO MICROSOFT EXCEL</h2>
 
<P>
Once you have retrieved the data from your source in Q+E, you will
usually want to modify or analyze the data in some fashion. While Q+E
does have some capabilities for doing this, Microsoft Excel is much
more robust and gives additional freedom to the automated system
designer. The following examples illustrate some simple methods of
retrieving data from Q+E for manipulation in Microsoft Excel.
<P>
This section does not show all the methods of retrieving data, but it
presents examples that show beginning users how to accomplish their
goals.
<P>
<P><h3>With the COPY() and PASTE() Functions</h3>
 
<P>
The easiest way to get data into Microsoft Excel is to duplicate what
is possible "manually"--that is, to physically copy and paste the
data. Assume, for example, that you have been asked to verify one
piece of data: Tyler Bennett's salary. The following macro uses the
COPY() and PASTE() functions to find Bennett's record based on his
unique employee ID
<P>
<PRE>   chan=INITIATE("QE","SYSTEM")
   =EXECUTE(chan,"[open('select * from c:\excel\qe\EMP.DBF where
   EMP_ID = ''E10297''')]")
   =EXECUTE(chan,"[select.area('r1c5')]")
   =EXECUTE(chan, "[copy()]")
   =SELECT(B1)
   =PASTE()
   =TERMINATE(chan)
   =RETURN()

</PRE>where the second and third lines of code should be entered all on one
line.
<P>
Note that because you know Bennett's salary is going to be in the
first row, fifth column (R1C5), you can select the area with the
SELECT.AREA() function, copy the cell, and paste the contents into B1
of your macro sheet (where B1 is an arbitrarily chosen cell).
<P>
After this macro has run, you should see the value 32000 in cell B1 of
your macro sheet.
<P>
<P><h3>With the FETCH() Command</h3>
 
<P>
You can also use the Q+E FETCH() command to bring the data into
Microsoft Excel. For example, in the following line of macro code,
where your macro sheet is named &lt;Macro1,&gt;
<P>
<PRE>   =EXECUTE(chan,"[FETCH('excel','&lt;Macro1&gt;','r1c2','r1c5')]")

</PRE>your data will be returned to cell R1C2 (or B1) on that sheet. This
function achieves the same result as the example in the "With the COPY()
and PASTE() Functions" section of this Application Note, but the FETCH()
command requires only one statement.
<P>
<P><h2>USING THE REQUEST() FUNCTION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>To Determine the Results of Your Query</h3>
 
<P>
Assume that you are asked to retrieve a large list of data from your
DBMS containing the first and last name, employee ID, and salary of
all employees earning $30,000 or more. To locate this unknown number
of records, you could use a macro similar to the following
<P>
<PRE>   chan=INITIATE("QE","SYSTEM")
   =EXECUTE(chan,"[open('select FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, EMP_ID,
   SALARY from c:\excel\qe\EMP.DBF where SALARY &gt;= 30000')]")
   NR=REQUEST(chan,"NUMROWS")
   NC=REQUEST(chan,"NUMCOLS")

</PRE>where the second and third lines of code are entered all on one single
line with a space between FROM and C:.
<P>
The variables "NR" and "NC" are used to represent the number of
records (rows and columns) returned by the query. It could be that
there are no employees making more than $30,000. You could use macro
code similar to the following to select the area, copy, and paste the
data into Microsoft Excel:
<P>
<PRE>   =EXECUTE(chan,"[select.area('r1c1:r"&amp;NR&amp;"c"&amp;NC&amp;"')]")
   =EXECUTE(chan,"[copy()]")
   =SELECT(B1)
   =PASTE()

</PRE>You can paste a large amount of data into cell B1 because Microsoft
Excel will automatically expand the range if there isn't enough room.
Six records will be returned, and you should see this data highlighted
in B1:E6. Performing the same operation with the FETCH() command might
look like the following:
<P>
<PRE>   =EXECUTE(chan,"[FETCH('excel','Macro1',
   'r1c2:r"&amp;NR&amp;"c"&amp;NC&amp;"','r1c2:r"&amp;NR&amp;"c"&amp;NC&amp;"')]")

</PRE>NOTE: The above code should be entered as one single line of code,
with a space after the comma and before the first single quotation
mark before r1c2.
<P>
<P><h3>To Determine How Many Records Meet Your Criteria</h3>
 
<P>
You may need to determine how many records a query has returned. If
you are expecting one and receive many more, your data may be in
error, or your query may need to be refined. As the macro designer, it
is up to you to decide which of these two conditions exists.
<P>
You can determine how many rows (records) and columns (fields) are in
the active query window by using the REQUEST() function with "NUMROWS"
and "NUMCOLS" as parameters. Using these parameters, you can determine
the number of records, the number of fields or both, as in the
following example
<P>
<PRE>   NR=REQUEST(chan,"NUMROWS")
   NC=REQUEST(chan,"NUMCOLS")

</PRE>where the variable "NR" is defined as the number of rows (or records)
in the active query window. The variable "NC" is defined as the number
of columns (or fields) in the active query window. These functions
allow the client to determine how many rows (records) and columns
(fields) have met the criteria. You can use these functions when you
need to know the number of records or fields that are available in
your application.

<P><h2>GETTING DATA FROM MICROSOFT EXCEL TO Q+E</h2>
 
<P>
This section discusses many different ways to get data from Q+E to
Microsoft Excel. The method you should use depends on the kind of data
you are using. You may also be able to use a combination of methods.
This section does not show all the methods of moving data from
Microsoft Excel to Q+E, but it presents you with the most
straightforward methods.
<P>
<P><h3>With the COPY() and PASTE() Functions</h3>
 
<P>
Assume Tyler Bennett has received a $3,000 raise (his salary increased
from $32,000 to $35,000). Building on the example from the "Getting Data
from Q+E to Microsoft Excel" section this Application Note, assume that a
query window is open in Q+E with all fields visible and only Tyler's record
<P>
from EMP.DBF. The following macro asks you to enter Tyler's new salary, and
<P>
the macro places that value in cell B1 of the macro sheet. The macro then
selects the destination cell with the SELECT.AREA() function and turns on
the ALLOW.EDIT() function so you can make changes:
<P>
<PRE>   =FORMULA(INPUT("Input Tyler's NewSalary (35000)",1),B1)
   =EXECUTE(chan,"[SELECT.AREA('r1c5')]")
   =EXECUTE(chan,"[ALLOW.EDIT(true)]")

</PRE>To place the value in B1 in the Clipboard so that you can paste it,
use the following functions:
<P>
<PRE>   =SELECT(B1)
   =COPY()
   =EXECUTE(chan,"[PASTE()]")

</PRE>With the POKE() Function
 
<P>
You can also use the POKE() function to move the data into Q+E by
specifying where the data is stored in Microsoft Excel (R1C2 or B1)
and then specifying the destination in Q+E (R1C5):
<P>
<PRE>   =POKE(chan,"r1c5","r1c2")

</PRE>For example, if you modify some of the fields for Tyler Bennett, and
you store this data in the macro sheet in cells B1:I1, this data
constitutes one complete record in the database:
<P>
<PRE>   |  B   |   C     |   D   |  E    |  F   |  G   | H |    I
</PRE> 
1  |Tyler | Bennett |E10297 |6/1/77 |32000 | D101 | Y | Volleyball
<P>
To place this data into Q+E as a unit [with a different method than
just copying and pasting or using the POKE() function with individual
fields], you could use the following macro (assume that you have only
Bennett's record from EMP.DBF in a query window in Q+E, and you've
already allowed editing):
<P>
<PRE>   =EXECUTE(chan,"[SELECT.AREA('r1c1:r1c8')]")
   =SELECT(B1:I1)
   =COPY()
   =EXECUTE(chan,"[PASTE()]")

</PRE>This macro updates the entire record in the database to the values in
B1:I1. You can obtain these same results with the POKE() function:
<P>
<PRE>   =POKE(chan,"r1c1:r1c8","r1c2:r1c9")

</PRE>You could also select the range B1:I1 in the macro sheet, define it
with the name &lt;NewData&gt;, and use the POKE() function with the defined
name, as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   =POKE(chan,"r1c1:r1c8",NewData)

</PRE><h2>USING COPY() AND PASTE() TO ADD NEW RECORDS TO AN EXISTING DATABASE</h2>
 
<P>
One of the most basic features of an automated system is that of
adding records to an existing database. In this example, assume that
you have a record or series of records that needs to be appended to an
existing database. These records are in B1:I4 (you've named this range
"NewRecords"). The data is as follows:
<P>
<PRE>  |  B    |   C    |   D    |   E    |   F   |  G   | H |    I
</PRE> 
<PRE>1 | Bob   | Smith  | E12345 | 1/1/89 | 18750 | D101 | N |
</PRE>2 | Steve | Jones  | E23456 | 2/1/89 | 22500 | D050 | Y | Sailboard
3 | Linda | Simons | E34567 | 3/1/89 | 22500 | D101 | N | Scuba
4 | Peter | Thomas | E45678 | 4/1/89 | 24250 | D101 | Y |
<P>
The easiest way to place these new records in the EMP.DBF database is
to use the COPY() function to copy this area to the Clipboard and use
the PASTE.APPEND() function to paste the records at the end of the
database (assume that you've opened EMP.DBF and allowed editing):
<P>
<PRE>   =SELECT(NewRecords)
   =COPY()
   =EXECUTE(chan,"[PASTE.APPEND()]")

</PRE><h2>USING POKE() TO ADD NEW RECORDS TO AN EXISTING DATABASE</h2>
 
<P>
Using the POKE() function when you are adding new records is more
complicated than using the COPY() and PASTE() functions. There is no
Q+E command that allows you to easily create new blank records. To add
new records, you must add blank records to your database as
placeholders, and then you can use the POKE() function to transfer
these new records.
<P>
For example, assume you have set aside a range of cells (J1:O1 in this
example) on your macro sheet that you can use for placeholders. Name
this area "BlankRecord". Your data will resemble the following
example:
<P>
<PRE>     |  J    |   K    |   L   |   M    | N |  O
</PRE> 
<PRE>   1 | Blank | Record | e0000 | 1/1/00 | 0 | d000

</PRE>It doesn't really matter what this data is, but it does matter whether
your database requires a value to be in the field. If the field is a
required field that you've defined, you must put some data in that
field in your BlankRecord definition. No fields in EMP.DBF are
required, but Q+E does not allow a new record to be empty--that is, a
new record must contain at least one field with data.
<P>
To successfully append the new records, you must use the COPY()
function to copy data and use the PASTE.APPEND() function to paste the
same number of blank records to the end of your database as the number
of new records. To do this, you must know how many records are
currently in the database (NR) and the number of new records to be
added (NNR). In a FOR-NEXT loop, use the PASTE.APPEND() function to
paste a blank record for each new record required, then use the POKE()
function to move the new records into the database as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   chan=INITIATE("qe","system")
   =EXECUTE(chan,"[open('select * from c:\excel\qe\EMP.DBF')]")
   NR=REQUEST(chan,"numrows")
   NC=REQUEST(chan,"numcols")
   NNR=ROWS(NewRecords)
   =EXECUTE(chan,"[allow.edit(true)]")
   =SELECT(BlankRecord)
   =COPY()
   =FOR("counter",1,NNR)
   =EXECUTE(chan,"[paste.append()]")
   =NEXT()
   =POKE(chan,"r"&amp;NR+1&amp;"c1:r"&amp;NR+NNR&amp;"c"&amp;NC,NewRecords)
   =TERMINATE(chan)
   =RETURN()

</PRE>You can also use this method of appending one or more records to
insert records inside the database itself. Instead of adding the
record at the end, the blank records are inserted in the middle, and
the data is transferred using the POKE() function.

<PRE>     COMPARISON: QE.XLA MACRO FUNCTIONS OR DDE EXECUTE() COMMANDS?
     =============================================================

</PRE><h2>ADVANTAGES OF USING QE.XLA MACRO FUNCTIONS</h2>
 

<UL><LI>For those who are new to Microsoft Excel and Q+E, QE.XLA macro
   functions are easier to use and understand than EXECUTE() commands.

<LI>Q+E macro functions require fewer lines of code to accomplish tasks
   similar to ones you accomplish with EXECUTE() commands.

<LI>When modeling, you can initially create a macro more quickly with
   QE.XLA macro functions.

<LI>For some operations, QE.XLA macro functions are faster than the
   EXECUTE() command equivalents.

<LI>When you use the add-in macro functions, you do not need to know as
   much about DDE and the Microsoft Excel macro programming language
   as you do if you are using the EXECUTE() commands.
<P>
</UL><h2>DISADVANTAGES OF USING QE.XLA MACRO FUNCTIONS</h2>
 

<UL><LI>Because QE.XLA macro functions are provided in a Microsoft Excel
   add-in macro, QE.XLA macro functions may be supporting a large
   overhead. The QE.XLA macro functions are often very general with
   multiple (and sometimes redundant) error checking. Depending on
   your situation, this can be either an advantage or a disadvantage.

<LI>Using Q+E macro functions is not as flexible as using the EXECUTE()
   commands.

<LI>The more complicated your macro, the slower Q+E macro functions
   will be in comparison to EXECUTE() commands.
<P>
</UL><h2>SAMPLE MACROS TO COMPARE</h2>
 
<P>
The following sample macros compare Q+E macro functions and EXECUTE()
command-equivalent macros. Both sample macros log on to an SQL Server,
perform a simple query, and return the results to a Microsoft Excel
worksheet:
<P>
<P><h3>Example of Using Q+E Macro Functions</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   =ACTIVATE("sheet1")
   =DB.LOGON("SQLServer")
   =DB.SQL.QUERY(2,"use pubs; select * from sales where stor_id =
   ''7131''",1,FALSE)
   =RETURN()

</PRE>Note that the third and fourth lines of code should be entered as one
single line.
<P>
<P><h3>Example of Using EXECUTE() Commands</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   chan=INITIATE("qe","system")
   =EXECUTE(chan,"[logon('SQLServer')]")
   =EXECUTE(chan,"[open('use pubs; select * from SQLServer|dbo.sales
   where stor_id=''7131''')]")
   NR=REQUEST(chan,"numrows")
   NC=REQUEST(chan,"numcols")
   =EXECUTE(chan,"[fetch('excel','sheet1',
   'r1c1:r"&amp;NR&amp;"c"&amp;NC&amp;"','all')]")
   =EXECUTE(chan,"[close()]")
   =TERMINATE(chan)
   =RETURN()

</PRE>Note that the third and fourth lines of code should be entered as one
single line.
