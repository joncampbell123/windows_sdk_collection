7.00 97
WINDOWS
kb3rdparty
<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0
<LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you start Microsoft Excel, new workbooks may open repeatedly until
Microsoft Excel runs out of memory.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs if the file Msexcel4.xlm, installed by WinFax Pro
version 4.0, is located in your Xlstart folder. This file is installed by
WinFax Pro along with the file Msexcel5.xls so that you can fax worksheets
directly from within Microsoft Excel.
<P>
Normally, when you install Microsoft Excel 7.0, the Setup program removes
these files if they are located in your Xlstart folder. However, the
Microsoft Excel Setup program does not remove these files under the
following conditions:
<P>
<PRE>   If you install Microsoft Excel 5.0, and then install WinFax Pro,
   and then install Microsoft Office Preview Program (whether you remove
   the Office Preview Program or not), the Microsoft Excel 7.0 Setup
   program does not remove the files from your Xlstart folder.

   -or-

   If you install Microsoft Excel 5.0, and then install WinFax Pro,
   and then remove Microsoft Excel 5.0, the Microsoft Excel 7.0 Setup
   program does not remove the WinFax files from your Xlstart folder.

   -or-

   If you install WinFax Pro after installing Microsoft Excel 97, the
   Microsoft Excel or Microsoft Office Setup program does not remove the
   WinFax files from your Xlstart folder.

</PRE>In all of these cases, the WinFax Pro files Msexcel4.xlm and Msexcel5.xls
are located in the Microsoft Excel Xlstart folder; however, the Microsoft
Excel Setup program does not detect the earlier version of Microsoft Excel
on your computer, and does not remove the files.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this problem, remove both the Msexcel4.xlm and Msexcel5.xls
files from the Xlstart folder.
<P>
Note that if you experience this problem, you will have a large number of
workbooks open in Microsoft Excel. When you close Microsoft Excel, you can
avoid being prompted to save the changes in these workbooks by running the
following Visual Basic for Applications macro:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub MyExit()
       Application.DisplayAlerts = False
       Application.Quit
   End Sub

custom macros. For more information about Microsoft Solution Providers,

information about versions of these files that will be compatible with
Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, contact Delrina Technology.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when you use Microsoft Excel version 7.0 for Windows 95
and WinFax Pro version 4.0. This problem was corrected in Microsoft Office
versions 7.0a and 7.0b for Windows 95.
<P>
This problem also occurs when you use Microsoft Excel 97 if you place the
WinFax files in the Xlstart folder after you install Microsoft Excel 97.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The macros contained in the WinFax Pro files Msexcel4.xlm and Msexcel5.xls
are not compatible with Microsoft Excel version 7.0 or Microsoft Excel 97.
<P>
The problem described above also occurs if you open the Msexcel4.xlm file
in Microsoft Excel, even if the file is not located in the Xlstart folder.
The Msexcel5.xls file does not affect Microsoft Excel 7.0; however, it will
not work in Microsoft Excel 7.0 because it is designed for a 16-bit
application.
<P>
WinFax Pro is manufactured by Delrina Technology, Inc., a vendor
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise,
regarding this product's performance or reliability.
