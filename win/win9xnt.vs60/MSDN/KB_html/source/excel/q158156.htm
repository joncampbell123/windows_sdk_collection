The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you create a drawing object in Microsoft Excel 97, if you apply a
shadow to the drawing object, the shadow may appear differently than in
earlier versions of Microsoft Excel.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This will occur if all the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>The drawing object was created in Microsoft Excel 97.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -and-
</PRE>
<LI>The drawing object is not filled (it is transparent).
<P>
<P><PRE>    -and-
</PRE>
<LI>The workbook containing the drawing object has not been saved, or has
   been saved in the Microsoft Excel 97 format, closed and reopened.
<P>
</UL><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
If you create a drawing object in Microsoft Excel 97 and it needs to have a
solid shadow, you must apply a fill to the drawing object. Use the
following steps to do this:

<OL><P><LI>Select the drawing object.

<P><LI>On the Format menu, click AutoShape.

<P><LI>Click the Colors and Lines tab.

<P><LI>In the Fill drop-down list box in the Color section, click a color,
   or click Fill Effects and select a fill effect.

<P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
</OL>The shadow will now appear solid.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, drawing objects that you create can be filled or
unfilled. Filled objects are opaque; unfilled objects are transparent, and
you can see cells or other objects through them.
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 97, when you create a drawing object, such as a
rectangle, and then apply a shadow to the object, the shadow may not appear
solid, but as a line. This will occur if the drawing object is not filled
(it is transparent).
<P>
Shadows applied to drawing objects should appear correctly if any of the
following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>The drawing object was created in an earlier version of Microsoft
   Excel.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE>
<LI>The drawing object is filled.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE>
<LI>The workbook that contains the drawing object is not saved in the
   Microsoft Excel 97 format.
