The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When in a Microsoft Excel version 4.0 Workbook, you can page through
bound and unbound  documents by selecting the Paging button on the
lower right side of the Workbook Window. If, however, you have
multiple windows of the same document, you will not be able to page
through the different windows.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The particular window displayed when paging to a document with
multiple windows will either be window number one or the last one
that was displayed within the Workbook. This functionality is best
illustrated with the following example.
<P>
<P><h3>Example</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>From the File menu, choose New. Select Worksheet and choose OK.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose New. Select Workbook and choose OK.

<P><LI>Choose the Add button on the Workbook. Select the new worksheet
   and choose OK.

<P><LI>Choose the Next Page button in the lower right corner. The
   worksheet will now be active.

<P><LI>From the Window menu, choose New Window. You will now see
   window number two for the document, designated "SHEET1:2"
   (without quotation marks) in Microsoft Excel for Windows. In
   Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, this will be designated
   "WORKSHEET1:2".

<P><LI>Choose the Next Page button. You will now be returned to
   the Workbook.

<P><LI>Choose the Next Page button once more and you will be returned
   to SHEET1:2 in Windows or WORKSHEET1:2 on the Macintosh. The
   second window view was the last displayed for the document.
<P>
</OL>If you were to now select window number one from the Window menu, page
to the Workbook and back to the document, you would see SHEET1:1 or
WORKSHEET1:1 displayed. At this point, you will not be able to access
the second window view from the Window menu or by paging. The only way
to display the second window view is to unbind the document and then
save and open it as a separate file. All of the window views that were
created will be saved with the document.
