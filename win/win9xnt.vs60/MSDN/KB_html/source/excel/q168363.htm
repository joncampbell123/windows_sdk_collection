The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you open a workbook in Microsoft Excel 97, you may receive the
following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down.
   If the problem persists, contact the program vendor.

</PRE>If you click Details, you receive an error message similar to either of the
following:
<P>
<PRE>   EXCEL caused an invalid page fault in module EXCEL.EXE at
   0137:30104a84.

   EXCEL caused an invalid page fault in module EXCEL.EXE at
   0137:3011f337.

</PRE>When you click Close, Microsoft Excel 97 closes.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may occur if all of the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>In the workbook, you copy a range that contains shared formulas.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>You select a range that contains shared values or shared formulas, click
   Paste Special on the Edit menu, select an operation (for example, Add,
   Subtract, Multiply, or Divide), and then click OK.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>You save, close, and then attempt to reopen the workbook.
<P>
</UL>For additional information about shared formulas and shared values, see the
"More Information" section in this article.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To prevent this problem from occurring, do not copy a range of shared
formulas and use the Paste Special command to paste the copied formulas
into a range that contains shared values or shared formulas.
<P>
Note that the problem does not occur if any of the following conditions
are true:

<UL><LI>You copy the values and paste them onto the formulas. The problem occurs
   only when you paste shared formulas onto shared values or shared
   formulas.

<LI>The values or formulas onto which you paste the formulas are not shared.
   If at least one of the values or formulas is different from the
   others, the problem does not occur.
<P>
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If this problem is already occurring, you may not be able to open the
workbook. For additional information, please see the following articles in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../excel/q142117.htm">Q142117</A></B>
   TITLE     : Excel: Summary of Methods to Recover Data from Corrupted
               Files

   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../excel/q147216.htm">Q147216</A></B>
   TITLE     : XL: Linking to Data in a Damaged File (5.0 and Later)

</PRE>In Microsoft Excel, if a worksheet contains a sequence of cells that
contain formulas or values that follow a distinct pattern, the formulas or
values may be shared, for example, if a worksheet contains the following
formulas and values:
<P>
<PRE>   A1: =E1+F1   B1: 1   C1: 1
   A2: =E2+F2   B2: 1   C2: 2
   A3: =E3+F3   B3: 1   C3: 3
   A4: =E4+F4   B4: 1   C4: 4
   A5: =E5+F5   B5: 1   C5: 5
   A6: =E6+F6   B6: 1   C6: 6

</PRE>Note the pattern in the formulas in column A. Except that row numbers
increase by one in each row, each formula is identical to the formula in
the row above it. Because of this pattern, the formulas in column A are
shared formulas.
<P>
Shared values work slightly differently. Because all of the values in
column B are identical, they are shared values. Although there is a pattern
to the values in column C, they are not shared values because they are
different.
