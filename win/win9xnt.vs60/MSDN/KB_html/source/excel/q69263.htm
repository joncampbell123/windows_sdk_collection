</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
To embed a Microsoft Excel worksheet into another Microsoft Excel
worksheet, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Start up two sessions of Excel. Because embedding can only take
   place between applications, you must have both the application that
   is acting as the embedding server, and the application that is
   acting as the embedding client, running simultaneously.

<P><LI>Open or create a worksheet in the session that is acting as the
   server application.

<P><LI>Highlight a range of cells on the worksheet.

<P><LI>Choose Copy from the Edit menu.

<P><LI>Activate the session that is the client application and select a
   cell in the worksheet onto which you want to place the embedded
   worksheet.

<P><LI>Press the SHIFT key as you choose the Paste Picture command from
   the Edit menu.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The embedded worksheet will appear on the worksheet and, whenever
selected, the formula bar will display the following formula
<P>
<PRE>   =EMBED("ExcelWorksheet",&lt;range_text&gt;)

</PRE></OL>where &lt;range_text&gt; is a string that describes the range of cells
that define the worksheet (in R1C1 notation). For example, while
editing the worksheet to be embedded, if you used the CTRL+END
keyboard combination to move to and select the active cell at the
lower-right corner of the worksheet, and the cell D10 is selected,
then the EMBED function would be
<P>
<PRE>   =EMBED("ExcelWorksheet","R1C1:R10C4")

</PRE>because R1C1:R10C4 is the R1C1 format for the range of cells, A1:D10,
that are active in the worksheet.
<P>
An embedded worksheet is used when you want a picture of an existing
spreadsheet, but you do not want it to update dynamically.
