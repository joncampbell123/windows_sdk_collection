The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 97, when you save a shared workbook and resolve
conflicts in the workbook, worksheets that previously were hidden may
become visible.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem will occur if a conflict occurs on a hidden worksheet.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
If a conflict occurs on a hidden worksheet, you cannot prevent this problem
from occurring. You can, however, manually rehide any worksheets that
should be hidden by following these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Activate the worksheet that you want to hide.

<P><LI>On the Format menu, point to Sheet, and click Hide.
<P>
</OL>Once you have rehidden any of the worksheets you want to hide, save the
workbook.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you share a workbook in Microsoft Excel 97, multiple users can
simultaneously make changes to the workbook. When you save a workbook that
is shared, the Resolve Conflicts dialog box will appear if two or more
users have entered different values into a cell in a worksheet in the
workbook. You can use the Resolve Conflicts dialog box to determine what
value is retained by the cell.
<P>
When the Resolve Conflicts dialog box appears, if the worksheet where a
conflict occurs is hidden, the worksheet will be unhidden, no matter what
button you click (Accept All Mine, Accept All Others, Accept Mine, Accept
Other, or Cancel).
