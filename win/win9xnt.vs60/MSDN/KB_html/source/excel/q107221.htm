Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In the Microsoft Excel Function Wizard, the "Most Recently Used" function
category contains the last 10 functions you used in the Function Wizard.
When you use a function in the Function Wizard, that function is added to
the "Most Recently Used" list. If there are already 10 functions in the
list, the last function on this list is removed from the list and the new
function is added.
<P>
It is not possible to remove the "Most Recently Used" list from the
Function Wizard.
<P>
When you start the Function Wizard, the function category you used last
is automatically selected. For example, if the last category you used
was the "Most Recently Used" category, this category will be selected
when you next use the Function Wizard.
<P>
NOTE: The most recently used list in the Function Wizard is not updated if
you are using a custom function or a function from an add-in. The list is
updated only when you use the functions that are in the function wizard by
default.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>

<P><PRE>      MRUFuncs=
</PRE>
<P><LI>Save the Excel5.ini file and quit the text editor.

<P><h3>Preventing the Most Recently Used Function List from Being Updated</h3>

being updated is to not use the Function Wizard. Functions that are
entered without using the Function Wizard are not added to the Most
Recently Used Function list.
