The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Exchange, Version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you open a password protected Microsoft Excel workbook from a
Microsoft Exchange folder, the file may open without displaying a dialog
box asking you for the password.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When you move a Microsoft Excel workbook into a Microsoft Exchange folder,
the security attributes of the Password to Modify option assigned in
Microsoft Excel are ignored.
<P>
NOTE: If you saved your Microsoft Excel file with a Password to Open
option, you are prompted for this password when you open your file from an
Exchange folder.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1: Place File in a Secure Exchange Folder</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft Exchange provides its own set of security attributes for
Microsoft Exchange folders. If you want to restrict access to a Microsoft
Excel file in a Microsoft Exchange folder, you must place the file in an
Exchange folder that has the appropriate file/share security.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 2: Change the Type of Password Protection</h3>
 
<P>
Change the password protection type to Password to Open. To do this with a
file that already has Password to Modify protection, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Open the file in Microsoft Excel.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Save As.

<P><LI>In the Save As dialog box, click Options.

<P><LI>In the Save Options dialog box remove the Password to Modify password.

<P><LI>Type a password in the Password to Open edit box and click OK.

<P><LI>Reenter the password in the Confirm Password dialog box and click OK.

<P><LI>Click Save to save your file.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: You need to consider the ramifications of saving your file with a
Password to Open password versus a Password to Modify password. Each type
of password offers different protection for your file and in some cases,
one type may be more appropriate than the other.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
