<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, a macro that opens and then hides a document which
has been saved and minimized as an icon may produce unpredictable
results when your screen is redrawn. These unexpected results include
displaying only a portion of the hidden worksheets' icon and control
menu box. When this happens, you may be able to select some of the
control menu commands (such as the Maximize command).
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
These unexpected results occur when the ECHO(FALSE) macro command
appears in the macro prior to the OPEN() and HIDE() statements.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To keep the screen from being redrawn, do either of the following:

<UL><LI>Save the document window in the maximized or restored state.
<P>
 -or-

<LI>Do not use the ECHO(FALSE) command before you open the sheet.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, the following attributes are saved when you save a
document: the window size, the number of open windows, and the state
(other than the maximized state) of the window. If you save a
worksheet in the minimized state (as an icon), it will appear as an
icon when you reopen it.
<P>
You CAN unhide a sheet by choosing the Unhide command from the Window
menu, even if the sheet is minimized and opened while ECHO=FALSE is
active. When you are using ECHO(TRUE), a macro to OPEN() and HIDE()
the sheet will display the icon briefly before hiding it.
