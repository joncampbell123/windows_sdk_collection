<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you double-click a cell to edit text in the cell, the formula bar
expands to display the text, the cursor disappears, and the cell you are
editing is hidden by the text in the formula bar.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when you double-click a cell that contains a large
amount of text. The text and the pointer is hidden behind the expanded
formula bar. Note that the cell contents appear in the formula bar, which
expands display all the text in the cell.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, use either of the following methods.
<P>
Method 1: If you are using a pointer device such as a mouse or a trackball,
<PRE>          click the formula bar to display the insertion point.

</PRE>Method 2: Disable the formula bar to prevent the cell from becoming hidden.
<PRE>          To do this, click Formula Bar on the View menu. This command
          toggles the formula bar off.

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 97, the maximum number of characters that you can type
in a single cell is 32,767. In earlier versions of Microsoft Excel, the
limit is 255.
<P>
The formula bar can display the entire contents of a single cell by
expanding downward into the worksheet. The greater the number of characters
in the cell, the larger the formula bar must expand to display the cell
contents. Note that the formula bar can overlap and hide portions of the
worksheet if there are a lot of characters in the cell.
<P>
<P><h2>REFERENCES</h2>
 
<P>

Microsoft Excel Help, type the following text
<P>

</PRE>and then double-click the selected text to go to the "Edit cell contents"
topic.
