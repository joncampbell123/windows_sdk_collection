<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If the Setup program in Microsoft Excel for Windows is interrupted
unexpectedly by any means other than choosing Exit while in Setup,
attempting to run Setup again may result in the error, "Can only run one
copy of Setup at a time." This error will display even though only one copy
of Setup is running.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When Setup initializes, it creates a directory called "MS-SETUP.T"
(without quotation marks) in the root directory of the drive on which
you are installing Excel. If Setup is unexpectedly interrupted after
this directory has been created, it will be left on your drive and you
will receive the Setup initialization error listed above when trying
to run Setup again. An unexpected interruption is a system stop or
hang while Setup is running or if Setup is otherwise aborted by
rebooting rather than by exiting.
<P>
In order to run Setup without receiving the error, locate the
directory MS-SETUP.T and delete it. If a system stop or hang caused
the initial setup to fail, normal troubleshooting steps should be
taken to determine the source of the conflict. A good place to start
is by rebooting the machine with clean AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS
files. Also ensure that all items are removed from the Windows 3.1
Startup group and that the Load= and Run= lines in the WIN.INI file
are blank (both Windows 3.1 and 3.0).
