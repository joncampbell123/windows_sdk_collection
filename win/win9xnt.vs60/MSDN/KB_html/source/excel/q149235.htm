<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The "More Information" section of this article discusses features
available in Microsoft Excel that are designed to help prevent data
loss. It also discusses ways to prevent file corruption.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>AutoSave</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft Excel versions 3.0 and later include an AutoSave feature. You
can customize this feature to automatically save your file after a
specific amount of time. It does not make a backup copy of your file, so
it does not protect against file corruption; rather, it protects your
data in the event that Microsoft Excel unexpectedly quits (for example,
if the computer unexpectedly loses power).
<P>
For additional information about using AutoSave, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../excel/q147778.htm">Q147778</A></B>
   TITLE     : XL: How to Enable AutoSave

</PRE><h3>Automatic Backup</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft Excel versions 2.x and later include an "Always Create Backup"
option. This feature will always save the previous version of your
Microsoft Excel file when you save changes to your current Microsoft
Excel file. This helps to protect against file corruption; however, the
information in the backup file will be one save out of date.
<P>
This option can be accessed from the Save As dialog box by clicking the
Options. By default, this option is not selected. To change this option
for all new documents, modify the template for the default startup
worksheet or workbook. Refer to your "Microsoft Excel User's Guide" or Help
for more information about the Always Create Backup option.
<P>
For additional information about customizing the default document
template in Microsoft Excel, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : Excel: Customizing Default Document Templates

</PRE><h3>Hard Disk Maintenance</h3>
 
<P>
A hard (or fixed) disk is a mechanical device with moving parts. Like
all mechanical devices it will eventually wear out and fail; hard disk
manufacturers often measure the reliability of their drives as the
average number of hours before failure or "mean time between failure"
(MTBF).
<P>
As a hard disk wears out, portions of it become unreadable and are often
referred to as bad sectors. One side effect of this is file corruption; if
a file is stored on a portion of the hard disk that becomes unreadable, the
file can no longer be retrieved.
<P>
One method for combating file corruption is to perform maintenance on
your hard disk on a regular basis. One recommended schedule involves
running ScanDisk or a third-party hard disk utility to check the file
structure of the hard disk once a week. Then, run the utility once a
month to perform a surface scan of the hard disk media. For more
information, consult the manual for the maintenance utility program.
Note that if you have Plus! for Windows 95, you can use the System Agent to
schedule ScanDisk to run automatically.
<P>
For additional information about using hard disk utilities with Windows
95, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../win95x/q120442.htm">Q120442</A></B>
   TITLE     : Using Hard Disk Utilities with Windows 95

</PRE>Other troubleshooting steps you can take to help prevent file corruption
include the following:

<UL><LI>Exit Windows before you restart or shut down the computer.

<LI>Move sources of electromagnetic radiation (such as radios, fax machines,
   televisions, stereos, speakers, et cetera) away from your computer.

<LI>Do not place floppy disks on top of a computer monitor (it is a source
   of electromagnetic radiation).

<LI>Regularly scan your computer for viruses.

<LI>Store floppy disks in a disk storage container (such as the box the
   disks came in) to prevent dust from building up on the disks.

<LI>Prevent dust from building up around your computer.
<P>
</UL><h3>Backing Up Data</h3>
 
<P>
One of the best ways to prevent data loss is to back up data regularly.
The more important your data, the more frequently you should back it up.
<P>
If you consider your information critical, it is recommended that you
save your files to at least two different locations, at least one of
which is a removable media such as a floppy disk or a computer tape. The
removable media should then be stored in a fireproof safe. Note that
there are different grades of fireproof safes; for removable media to
survive a fire, the interior temperature of the safe must not exceed 110
degrees Fahrenheit during the fire. Check with the manufacturer of your
safe for more information.
<P>

</PRE>If you have Plus! for Windows 95, you can schedule it to automatically back
up your system.
