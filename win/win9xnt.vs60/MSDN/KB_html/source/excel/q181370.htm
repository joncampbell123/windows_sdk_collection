<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Excel incorrectly assumes that the year 1900 is a leap year. This
article explains why the year 1900 is treated as a leap year and outlines
the problems that may occur if this specific problem is corrected.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When Lotus 1-2-3 was first released, the program assumed that the year 1900
was a leap year even though it was not a leap year. This made it easier for
the program to handle leap years and caused no harm to almost all date
calculations in Lotus 1-2-3.
<P>
When Microsoft Multiplan and Microsoft Excel were released, they also
assumed that 1900 was a leap year. This allowed Microsoft Multiplan and
Microsoft Excel to use the same serial date system used by Lotus 1-2-3 and
provide greater compatibility with Lotus 1-2-3. Treating 1900 as a leap
year also made it easier for users to move worksheets from one program to
the other.
<P>
Although it is technically possible to correct this behavior so that
current versions of Microsoft Excel do not assume that 1900 is a leap year,
the disadvantages of doing so outweigh the advantages.
<P>
If the problem were to be corrected many problems would occur. For example,
the following problems would occur:

<UL><LI>Almost all dates in current Microsoft Excel worksheets and other
   documents would be decreased by one day. Correcting this shift could
   take considerable time and effort, especially in formulas that use
   dates.

<LI>Some functions, such as the WEEKDAY function, would return different
   values; this could cause formulas in worksheets to work incorrectly.

<LI>Correcting this problem would break serial date compatibility
   between Microsoft Excel and other programs that use dates.
<P>
</UL>If the problem remains uncorrected, only one problem occurs:

<UL><LI>The WEEKDAY function returns incorrect values for dates before March
   1, 1900. Because most users do not use dates before March 1, 1900, this
   problem is rare.
<P>
   For more information about this problem, please see the following
   article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

<PRE></PRE>      TITLE     : XL: Days of the Week Before March 1, 1900, Are
                  Incorrect

</PRE></UL>Note that Microsoft Excel correctly handles all other leap years, including
century years that are not leap years (for example, 2100). Only the year
1900 is incorrectly handled.
