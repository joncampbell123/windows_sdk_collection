encounter when you use Q+E and offers tips about how to perform
specific tasks in Q+E. The appendixes list documentation errors,
provide an overview of SQL, and supply examples of dynamic data
exchange (DDE) macros that you can use when you use Microsoft Excel

<P>
<PRE>                      LOGGING ON TO YOUR DATABASE
                      ===========================

</PRE><h2>ORACLE</h2>
 
<P>
The Q+E ORACLE driver supports a connection to ORACLE 6.0 running on
an OS/2(R) platform. To log on to ORACLE do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Obtain the client software from Oracle and install it on your hard
   disk. ORACLE provides a directory (called ORACLE) of SQL*Net
   Services to connect to the server through a variety of different
   networks.

<P><LI>Add the following line to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file:
<P>
<P><PRE>      set config=c:\oracle\config.ora
</PRE><P>
   Make sure the ORACLE directory is on your path and that Microsoft
   Excel (or the directory where QE.EXE is located) is on the PATH
   statement in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

<P><LI>Before you start Windows, run the appropriate program for your
   network at the MS-DOS prompt.
<P>
<PRE>      If you are using this network    Run this program
   --------------------------------------------------------

      Microsoft LAN Manager            SQLNTB.EXE
      Novell(R) NetWare(R)             SQLSPX.EXE
      DECnet(TM) Pathworks(TM) 4.0     SQLDNT.EXE
      Banyan(R) VINES(R)               SQLVIN.EXE

</PRE><P><LI>Start Windows, and then start Q+E.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Logon. Fill in the appropriate
   information in the Logon dialog box. For example, type:
<P>
<P><PRE>      LOGON: &lt;b:MYSERVER&gt;
      USERNAME: &lt;SCOTT&gt;
      PASSWORD: &lt;TIGER&gt;
</PRE><P>
</OL>NOTE: You must specify the drive for LAN Manager networks. This drive
letter will vary depending on your particular network. If you are
unsure which letter to designate, switch to the MS-DOS prompt, change
to the ORACLE directory, and type type config.ora to display a local
variable that will indicate the drive letter you are to use. The drive
letter is case-sensitive. The following table lists some network
programs and specifies the drive letters that are typically associated
with them.
<P>
<PRE>      This network program      Uses this drive letter
   -------------------------------------------------------

      TCP/IP SQLNTB.EXE                   T
      Novell SQLIPX.EXE                   X
      LAN Manager SLQNTB.EXE              B
      DECnet SQLDNT.EXE                   D

   Neither the Q+E Oracle driver nor SQLNTB.EXE has been tested for
   connecting to ORACLE running on a UNIX(R) platform. The Q+E Oracle
   driver can connect to ORACLE running on a VAX, but only in standard
   mode.

</PRE></OL><h2>DEC RDB</h2>
 
<P>
To use the DEC RDB driver to access an RDB database, you must first
install and run DECnet services to connect to the data. See your DEC
RDB database administrator or RDB manual for details, or contact
Digital Equipment Corporation for the proper DECnet files.
<P>
You can trace most problems in connecting with RDB to an invalid
schema statement. The schema statement cannot include logical
operators and the entire sentence must be spelled out as in the
following example:
<P>
<PRE>   declare schema filename 'sys$sysdevice:[dbk$personnel]personnel'

   disk name : sys$sysdevice:
   directory name : [dbk$personnel]
   database name : personnel

</PRE><h2>SQL</h2>
 
<P>
In general, you do not need to obtain any special software to log on
to Microsoft SQL Server. Three dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) are
required to create named pipes to access Microsoft SQL Server. These
DLLs include a DB-Library, a Net-Library, and a Network API Library:

<UL><LI>NETAPI.DLL should be located in your network directory and is
   provided by your network vendor.

<LI>W3DBLIB.DLL is located in your EXCEL directory.

<LI>DBNMP3.DLL is located in your EXCEL directory.
<P>
</UL>W3DBLIB.DLL and DBNMP3.DLL are shipped with Microsoft Excel 4.0.
<P>
NOTE: The QEREADME.TXT that shipped with Microsoft Excel advises that
you use the SQL Server 4.20.00s versions of W3DBLIB.DLL and
DBNMP3.DLL. Do not follow this advice. These versions of the DLLs may
cause the Q+E warning "Changed language setting to US_English" when
you query SQL tables in Q+E. To avoid this error message, use the DLLs
that shipped with Microsoft Excel 4.0. To use these DLLS, do either of
the following:

<UL><LI>Make sure that Microsoft Excel is in your PATH statement, and
   rename the SQL W3DBLIB.DLL and DBNMP3.DLL files to
   W3DBLIB.BAK and DBNMP3.BAK.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Upgrade the DB-Library to version 4.20.21. This version is
   available with the current version of the SQL Server update.
<P>
</UL>Microsoft Excel ships with version 1.10 of these DLLs, and installs
them in the EXCEL directory.
<P>
<PRE>   Filename      File size       Date
</PRE> 
<P>
<PRE>   W3DBLIB.DLL   130736 bytes    4/2/92
   DBNMP3.DLL    8017 bytes      4/2/92

</PRE>NOTE: These dates reflect the date Microsoft Excel 4.0 shipped; these
versions of the DLLs are actually earlier versions than the ones that
ship with SQL.
<P>
SQL Server 4.2 ships with version 4.20.00 of the same DLLs and
installs them in the SQL directory.
<P>
<PRE>   Filename      File size       Date
</PRE> 
<P>
<PRE>   W3DBLIB.DLL   163536 bytes    2/26/92
   DBNMP3.DLL    7921 bytes      2/26/92

</PRE>The text of the QEREADME.TXT that shipped with Microsoft Excel version
4.0a has been revised.
<P>
<P><h2>SYBASE SQL SERVER</h2>
 
<P>
Connecting to SYBASE SQL Server has not been tested with Q+E. To
connect to a SYBASE SQL Server, you need to obtain files from Sybase
called Netlibrary and Client Library. These libraries contain a series
of Windows and MS-DOS DLLs that allow you to connect to a SYBASE SQL
Server.
<P>
<P>
<PRE>              PROBLEMS YOU MAY ENCOUNTER WHEN YOU USE Q+E
              ===========================================

</PRE><h2>CAN'T USE ALLOW EDITING COMMAND ON NOVELL NETWORK</h2>
 
<P>
The Allow Editing command on the Edit menu of Q+E may be unavailable
(dimmed) when you open a dBASE(R) file stored on a Novell server. (In
most cases, you will be allowed to edit the file if you log on with
Supervisor privileges. You will also be able to edit the dBASE file if
you open it in Microsoft Excel.) The Allow Editing command is
unavailable because Q+E cannot create the temporary file that it
requires. Q+E will attempt to create the temporary file in the root
directory of the drive on which the QE.EXE file resides. If you do not
have create and erase privileges for this root directory, Q+E will
fail to create a temporary file, and the Allow Editing command will be
unavailable.
<P>
Normally, you would not want to give a user privileges to create and
erase files in the root directory. However, you can use the Novell Map
Root command to map the user to a directory above the QE.EXE file
where the user can have create and erase privileges. For example,
assume that Q+E is on volume SYS on the file server NETONE. The path
to Q+E might resemble the following,
NETONE/SYS:PROGRAMS/APPS/EXCEL/QE.EXE.
<P>
<P>
To give a user privileges to create and
<P><h3>erase files in a directory above the QE.EXE file</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Use the Novell Map Root command to map the user to the APPS
   subdirectory:
<P>
<P><PRE>      map root f:=netone/sys:programs/apps
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      -or-
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      map root s1:=netone/sys:programs/apps
</PRE>
<P><LI>Give the user create and erase privileges for the APPS
   subdirectory.

<P><LI>Erase any temporary files from F and from the root of the file
   server.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: This problem may also occur on Banyan VINES networks.
<P>
<P><h2>Q+E PROMPTS YOU TO LOG ON WHEN YOU CHOOSE OPEN OR DEFINE</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the SQL Server, OS/2 Extended Edition, Oracle, or DEC RDB
database drivers, you must log on to the specific server to manipulate
its data.
<P>
If you choose this type of source as your default database driver, Q+E
prompts you to log on immediately after you choose Open or Define from
the File menu. You can either log on or choose the Cancel button. If
you want to switch to a source that does not require logging on
(ExcelFile, dBASEFile, or TextFile), change the source in your QE.INI
file so that it looks like the following (the QE.INI file is located
in your Windows directory and should be modified in a text editor such
as Notepad):
<P>
<PRE>   [Q+E]
   NoLogon=dBASEFile,TextFile,ExcelFile
   connect=dBASEFile

</PRE></OL>On an OS/2 system, this method does not work, and you must reinstall
Q+E, taking care not to choose SQLServer as the default driver. Your
files will not be affected by this process.
<P>
<P><h2>CAN'T HIDE THE LOGON DIALOG BOX</h2>
 
<P>
When you run Microsoft Excel macros or use links to connect to remote
databases, the Logon dialog box will always be displayed [regardless
of any LOGON() statements you use in your code].
<P>
When you log on using DDE, it is often preferable that these types of
dialog boxes be hidden from the user. However, this Logon dialog box
will appear every time you log on to your database management system
(DBMS), and there is no way to disable it.
<P>
SQL Server is the only exception to this rule. See "Appendix A,"
starting on page 12 of this Application Note, for the LOGON macro
command that can hide the dialog box.
<P>
<P>
<PRE>              PROBLEMS SPECIFIC TO THE SQL SERVER DRIVER
              ==========================================

</PRE><h2>MULTIPLE LOGON SCREENS AS DEFAULT DRIVER</h2>
 
<P>
If your default database driver is an SQL Server driver, you may
encounter two Logon dialog boxes when you run the Q+E DB.LOGON() or
LOGON() macro commands. To properly log on to the server, cancel the
second dialog box, and, in your QE.INI file, change the default driver
from SQLServer to another driver (for example, use dBASEFile).
<P>
<P><h2>PROBLEMS VIEWING TABLES</h2>
 
<P>
Tables on a SQL Server machine have a three-part ID. The following
table describes these parts.
<P>
<PRE>   Part of ID    What the part signifies
</PRE> 
<PRE>   Database      The database where the table is stored
   Owner         The logon ID of the table owner
   Tablename     The name of the table

</PRE>When you choose Open from the File menu and specify SQLServer as your
source, you may not see anything displayed in the Table Name box if
you have logged on as a user other than the system administrator or if
you have not created any tables.
<P>
By default, Q+E displays only the tables you have created. To view
tables that were created by another user, select that user's name from
the Owner list. For example, if you logged on as GUEST, you would not
see the sample files in the PUBS database, because the examples were
created by the user DBO. For the sample files to be listed in the
Table Name list box, select DBO from the Owner list.
<P>
<P><h2>UNABLE TO EDIT DATA OR RECORDS ARE LOCKED</h2>
 
<P>
When you open a SQL Server table, Q+E retrieves as many records as it
needs to fill up the window. As you scroll through the records, Q+E
retrieves new records from SQL Server. Q+E will not retrieve the last
record from SQL Server until you scroll to the bottom of the list.
<P>
As records are retrieved from SQL Server, Q+E copies them to a
temporary file, or buffer, on your workstation. When you scroll up,
Q+E reads copies of the records from the buffer, not from SQL Server.
Similarly, if you scroll down to records that you have already seen,
those records are read from the buffer.
<P>
While Q+E retrieves records from a SQL Server table, SQL Server places
locks on all or part of the table. The locks prevent other users from
modifying the records in the table while they are being retrieved.
Locks may be held until Q+E has read the last record from the table--
that is, when you have scrolled to the bottom of the window (to scroll
to the bottom of the window, press CTRL+END)--or until the window is
closed.
<P>
If you open a SQL Server table but don't scroll to the bottom of the
window, locks will remain on records in the table; these locks may
prevent other users from modifying records in the table. You can
remove the locks by scrolling to the bottom of the window or by
closing the window.
<P>
<P>
<PRE>                          TIPS FOR USING Q+E
                          ==================

</PRE><h2>FINDING SUBTOTALS</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Using the ExcelFile, dBASEFile, Oracle, and TextFile Drivers</h3>
 
<P>
The ExcelFile, dBASEFile, Oracle, and TextFile drivers for Q+E do not
support the COMPUTE BY or GROUP BY clauses required to find subtotals
in an SQL query [COMPUTE BY and GROUP BY are similar to the SUM-IF
statement and DSUM() function in Microsoft Excel].
<P>
One way to work around this behavior is to create a crosstab table in
Microsoft Excel. The following steps use this method to find the total
salary of employees in each of the departments in the EMP.DBF sample
file:
<P>
1.Set Database to External, and select the EMP.DBF sample database.
<P>
2.From the Data menu, choose Crosstab to bring up the Crosstab
<PRE>  ReportWizard.

</PRE>3.In the Crosstab ReportWizard dialog box, choose the Create A New
<PRE>  Crosstab button.

</PRE>4.Choose the Next button to skip the Row Categories dialog box.
<P>
5.In the Column Categories dialog box, select DEPT, and choose the
<PRE>  Add button. Choose the Next button to move to the next dialog box.

</PRE>6.In the Value Fields dialog box, select SALARY, and choose the Add
<PRE>  button. Choose the Next button to move to the next dialog box.

</PRE>7.In the Final dialog box, choose the Create It button.
<P>
Your crosstab table should resemble the following example:
<P>
<PRE>    | DEPT |
</PRE> 
<PRE>    | D050 | D101  | D190 | D202 | D050 | D101  | D190 | D202 | Grand
    |      |       |      |      |  Sum |  Sum  |  Sum |  Sum | total
</PRE> 
Sum | 68900| 169900| 86900| 86750| 68900| 169900| 86900| 86750| 412450
of  |
SALARY |
<P>
<P><h3>Using the SQL Server Driver</h3>
 
<P>
COMPUTE BY is not supported by the SQL Server driver in Q+E. COMPUTE
BY is a Transact-SQL statement that is not part of standard SQL. The
examples below describe an SQL query that will obtain subtotals using
SUM and GROUP BY. This query will not return a report with subtotals
after each category the way that COMPUTE BY does when executed from a
SQL Server front-end such as SAF. However, the report will list each
record, with the corresponding subtotal for its category displayed in
an additional field.
<P>
The result of the following steps will be a query that selects records
from the SALES table in the PUBS database and finds the total sales
for each stor_id. To have the SALES table available, you must have
installed the PUBS sample database.
<P>
<P><h3>Example 1</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start Q+E.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Logon, and log on to an SQL Server.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Open.

<P><LI>In the Table Name box, type PUBS.DBO.SALES.

<P><LI>In the Source box, select SQLServer, and choose the OK button.

<P><LI>From the Select menu, choose SQL Query.

<P><LI>After the field name stor_id, type SUM(QTY).

<P><LI>At the end of the query, type GROUP BY STOR_ID.
<P>
</OL>The query should now read:
<P>
<PRE>   USE pubs; SELECT stor_id, SUM(qty), ord_num, date, qty, payterms,
   title_id
   FROM dbo.sales
   GROUP BY stor_id

</PRE><P><LI>Choose the OK button to run the modified query.
<P>
</OL><h3>Example 2</h3>
 
<P>
To see only the unique stor_ids and their corresponding quantities:

<OL><P><LI>After you follow the steps in Example 1, select the ord_num, date,
   qty, payterms, and title_id fields.

<P><LI>From the Layout menu, choose Remove Column.

<P><LI>From the Select menu, choose Distinct.
<P>
</OL>The result should resemble the following example:
<P>
<PRE>     | stor_id  |  sum(qty)
</PRE></OL> 
<PRE>   1 |  6380    |      8
   2 |  7066    |    125
   3 |  7067    |     90
   4 |  7131    |    130
   5 |  7896    |     60
   6 |  8042    |     80

</PRE><h2>JOINING TABLES</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>When You're Working with Large Databases</h3>
 
<P>
You may find that joining and saving large files or tables is very
slow. Below are some suggestions for ways that you may be able to
optimize both your computer and your task to speed things up:

<UL><LI>Verify that your tables are truly relational, with no duplicate
   records or keys.

<LI>Run a compression utility on your hard disk.

<LI>Verify that you have 3-4 megabytes (MB) of hard disk space
   available.

<LI>Scroll to the end of each table (to do this, press CTRL+END) before
   joining the files.

<LI>Direct your SET TEMP statement to an adequate RAMDRIVE.SYS file.

<LI>Load the large tables to a RAMDRIVE.SYS file before opening them in
   Q+E.
<P>
</UL><h3>When You're Working with More Than One Table at a Time</h3>
 
<P>
Q+E lets you display data from multiple database tables in one Query
window using the Join command. To join two database tables in a single
Query window, the two tables must have at least one column in common.
When you join two tables, you join the data in one window (the source)
with data in the destination or active window.
<P>
You may need to join two tables if you want to display certain
information that is not contained in a single table. For example, you
might have a master table that contains employee last names and
employee numbers and a Badge table that contains employee numbers and
badge numbers to allow for employees who have more than one badge
number.
<P>
If you want to create a query that displays last names and badge
numbers of employees, you must join the tables. You can join tables by
choosing either the Join command or the Outer Join command from the
Select menu. Most of the time you will want to use the Join command.
The differences between Join and Outer Join are shown in the following
table.
<P>
<PRE>   Command      Result
</PRE> 
<PRE>   Join         Discards all records in the destination
                window that don't have matching records in
                the source window

   Outer Join   Shows all records from the destination
                window whether they match or not

</PRE>The usual procedure for joining database tables is as follows:

<OL><P><LI>To open the database tables you want to join, choose Open from the
   File menu.

<P><LI>From the Window menu, choose Arrange All to view both files at
   once.

<P><LI>In the source file, select the column you want to match.

<P><LI>In the destination file, select the column that matches the source
   file's column.

<P><LI>From the Select menu, choose Join.
<P>
</OL><h2>UPDATING YOUR QUERY</h2>
 
<P>
Q+E does not monitor the DBMS you are querying. This means that
changes made by other users will not be reflected until you change
your query in a way that causes Q+E to reread the records. If you want
to force Q+E to refresh the query, choose Query Now from the Select
menu.
<P>
<P><h2>USING Q+E WHEN YOU CREATE MAILING LABELS</h2>
 
<P>
A common misconception is that you can print or view mailing labels in
Q+E. However, Q+E merely creates a text file (with the .LAB extension)
based on the records and options you specify. To print or view the
file, you can open this text file in a text editor, such as Notepad,
or a word processor. You will get better results if you use a word
processor, such as Word or WordPerfect(R), because the robust text
filters in these word processors are more likely to preserve the
correct layout than a simpler program such as Write or Notepad. If the
text does not come out the way you like, experiment with different
ways to import the text. For example, you will get the best results in
Microsoft Word when you use the Text With Layout option when you open
the .LAB file.

<PRE>                   APPENDIX A--DOCUMENTATION ERRORS
                   ================================

</PRE></OL>This section identifies a number of documentation errors and
ambiguities that you may encounter in the Q+E for Microsoft Excel
"User's Guide" that comes with Microsoft Excel 4.0. We've done our
best to include them all and to make necessary corrections, but others
may exist.  If you find what you believe to be a documentation error,
or if you find something ambiguous in the documentation, please bring
it to our attention.
<P>
<PRE>Chapter 4:   "Saving a Query, Saving Results, and Printing"

   Page 28   Opening a query file
             --------------------
             Step 2. "Select the Query File" should read "Select
             Queryfile as the source."

   Page 28   Saving results to a new database file
             -------------------------------------
             Step 2. "Select the database format..." should read
             "Select the database format in the Destination
             box...."
             Step 4. "...turn on Use Headings for Field Names check
             box." This option is not available for Mailing Labels,
             PrintToFile, or QueryFile.

   Page 32   Printing to a file
             ------------------
             Step 3. "To set the page width...." This statement is
             ambiguous. You must specify the number of characters
             for the page width instead of setting the page width
             in inches.

Chapter 5:   "Editing the Current SQL Statement"

   Page 36   It's a good idea to include the source with all
             SQL SELECT statements. Page 36 has a list of each source
             and the name of the corresponding driver. The following
             example shows how to query dBASE-compatible files:

                select * from dBASEFile | c:\excel\qe\EMP.DBF

              This list should include the following new drivers.

                To query this source         Add this prefix
             ---------------------------------------------------

                Oracle                       Oracle|
                DEC RDB                      RDB|
                dBASE                        dBASEFile|
                Text file                    TextFile|
                SQL Server                   SQLServer|
                Microsoft Excel              ExcelFile|
                OS/2 1.3 Extended Edition    EEDataMgr|

             OS/2 is case-sensitive and can distinguish between
             "SQLServer" and "sqlserver." Please attempt to match the
             case of these drivers exactly when using OS/2.

             The documentation doesn't make it clear that some
             drivers aren't available in both environments. The OS/2
             Extended Edition database driver is available only with
             Q+E for OS/2 1.3. The Oracle and DEC RDB drivers are
             available only with Q+E for Windows. All other drivers
             are available in both environments.

Chapter 6:   "Editing Records"

   Page 37   Allowing editing
             ----------------
             You cannot edit Microsoft Excel files or Text files, so you
             cannot choose the Allow Editing command when working with
             one of these file types. Also, the Select Distinct command
             is not available with the dBASE File, Excel File, or Text
             File file types.

Chapter 8:   "Transferring Data to Other Applications"

   Page 49   The statement, "However, the data remains linked to the
             underlying database through Q+E," is incorrect. The data is
             not linked to the underlying database, but instead is
             linked directly to Q+E.

   Page 52   Linking a Microsoft Excel worksheet to an SQL statement
             "If the query text is greater than 127 characters,
             Microsoft Excel cannot automatically start Q+E to access
             the data." This statement is incorrect. Microsoft Excel has
             a limit of 255 characters per cell, so pasted data will be
             unavailable if the total DDE statement, including braces
             ({ }), is longer than 255 characters. As long as the total
             DDE statement does not exceed 255 characters, Microsoft
             Excel can automatically restart Q+E.

Chapter 9:   "Using Microsoft Excel to Access Data on External
             Databases"

   Page 57   The instructions listed for automatically starting Q+E
             in Microsoft Excel apply only to Microsoft Excel version
             3.0. To automatically start Q+E in Microsoft Excel 4.0, use
             the Add-in Manager to add the QE.XLA file located in the QE
             subdirectory (this subdirectory should be located in the
             directory where you installed Microsoft Excel). The Q+E
             Add-in menu commands will then be available in Microsoft
             Excel.

   Page 66   Database functions such as DSUM() do not work with
             external databases.

   Page 68   DB.DELETE()
             -----------
             In earlier versions of the "User's Guide," the heading
             shows only the question form of the function. There is a
             standard form as well. Also, change DB.DELETE?() to
             DB.DELETE()--no question mark--in the second-to-last line
             in the paragraph below the heading. DB.DELETE?() asks for
             confirmation from the user to delete all records and
             reports any errors, DB.DELETE() does not.

             DB.EXTRACT?()
             -------------
             Returns an error message if no records are found.

             DB.EXTRACT()
             ------------
             Does not return an error message.

   Page 69   DB.LOGON()
             ----------
             The "source" is the only logon parameter that will work
             with DB.LOGON. (The Q+E for Microsoft Excel "User's Guide"
             listed additional parameters, but they did not actually
             work.) In order to pass the server name, the user ID, and
             the password, you must use the Send.Keys command.

             Send.Keys is a Microsoft Excel macro command that passes
             through keystrokes using the shortcut keys. It is not a
             preferred method for running macros, but in this case, it
             is the only method that will work. Documentation for
             Send.Keys is located in your Microsoft Excel "Function
             Reference" under "Send.Keys," and the definitions are
             located under "On.Keys." Send.Keys commands are sent to a
             buffer, so always place them before the commands they will
             execute.

             For example, to log Pam into Testserv with the password of
             spam, use the following code:

                =SEND.KEYS("%STestserv%Lpam%Pspam~")
                =DB.LOGON("sqlserver")

             NOTE: Use the Logon command for SQL Server; additional
             parameters can be passed using this command.

   Page 70   DB.SET.DATABASE()
             -----------------
             You may need to execute DB.LOGON before the source you
             specify is available.

   Page 71   DB.PASTE.FIELDNAMES()
             ---------------------
             The second argument should read "paste_fields", not
             "fieldname". Also, when using this function, use one or the
             other argument (or neither), but not both.

   Page 71   DB.SQL.QUERY()
             --------------
             If you use Type 2 or 3, be certain to enter the query
             argument in double quotation marks:

                =DB.SQL.QUERY(3,"d:\excel\qe\QUERY1.QEF",1)

<P>
<PRE>   Page 74   In the sample Microsoft Word macro near the center
             of the page, the statement

                FROM EMP.DBF")

             should be changed to:

                chan=DDEInitiate("QE","SELECT LAST_NAME, HIRE_DATE
                FROM dBASEFile|EMP.DBF")

  Page 100   LOGON()
             -------
             There are undocumented parameters in the Logon command in
             Q+E version 3.0a that can be used with SQL Server.

              - Logon(dbname_Text,Connection_Text,Match_Previous,
                Show_Dialog)

              - dbname_Text = ServerType ()

              - Connection_Text = special keywords used to indicate
                connection parameters necessary to log on.

              - Keywords for the connection string include:

                   SRVR=name_of_the_server
                   UID=user_name
                   PWD=password
                   DB=database_name

              - Match_Previous = TRUE indicates that if the user has
                previously logged on to the same server, then use that
                connection. FALSE means start a new connection every
                time.

              - Show_Dialog = TRUE indicates that the Logon dialog box
                should be displayed.

             Example:

                =EXECUTE(chan,"[logon('SQLServer','SRVR=MYSVR;
                UID=guest;PWD=guest', TRUE,FALSE)]")

             NOTE: The example code is entered all on one line with a
             space between "PWD=guest'," and "TRUE."

  Page 101   OPEN()
             ------
             None of the optional parameters, except for the second one
             (source), will work with any OPEN version.

  Page 105   PASTE()
             -------
             The example should include a closing right parenthesis at
             the end of each line.

  Page 109   SAVE.LABELS.AS()
             ----------------
             The example produces a label with no spaces between
             FIRST_NAME and LAST_NAME or between STATE and ZIP. To
             create a label with proper spacing, use the following
             format instead:

                SAVE.LABEL.AS('ADDR.LAB','FIRST_NAME+'' ''+LAST_NAME;
                CITY+'',''+STATE+'' ''+ZIP',5,1,0,0,0)


             NOTE: This code must be entered all on one line with no
             space between the semicolon after LAST_NAME and CITY. Note
             also that the comma between CITY and STATE in the label
             definition appears to be enclosed in double quotation
             marks. It is actually enclosed in two sets of single
             quotation marks.


Appendix C   "Using Q+E with Microsoft Excel Worksheet Files"

  Page 143   "Opening a Microsoft Excel Worksheet in a Query Window"
             The second paragraph states that Q+E prompts you for a
             password if the worksheet is protected. This information is
             incorrect: there is no prompt, and Q+E is unable to load
             the file. To use this worksheet, you must unprotect it in
             Microsoft Excel first.


                        APPENDIX B--SQL BASICS
                        ======================

</PRE>The following information is included in the event that your DBMS has
not provided you with descriptions of Structured Query Language (SQL).
We have tried to cover only the major points; you may want to consult
more complete documentation for further information.
<P>
<P><h2>WHAT SQL IS</h2>
 
<P>
SQL is a standard database language used to query and manage
relational databases. Pronounced "sequel" by some and "S-Q-L" by
others, SQL is the database language of choice for the vast majority
of client-server database management systems. SQL is a comprehensive
language for controlling and interacting with a DBMS. SQL is
appropriate for a wide range of tasks, from casual database querying
to administration and programming. In this document, we will look at
using SQL as a query tool only--not as a programming tool.
<P>
<P><h2>WHAT SQL IS NOT</h2>
 
<P>
SQL is not a complete computer language like COBOL or C. There are no
IF statements for testing conditions and no DO or FOR statements for
looping. Instead, SQL is a database sublanguage, consisting of about
30 statements specialized for data management tasks. These SQL
statements are embedded in a host language, such as C, to extend that
language for use in database access.
<P>
The "structured" part of SQL is a little misleading, because it isn't
particularly structured, especially when compared to highly structured
languages such as C or Pascal. Instead, SQL statements resemble simple
English sentences with commonly understood keywords.
<P>
<P><h2>BASIC SYNTAX OF AN SQL QUERY</h2>
 
<P>
In the following examples, the SELECT statement is used to express an
SQL query. Every SELECT statement produces a table of query results
containing one or more columns and zero or more rows of data. The FROM
clause specifies the tables containing the data to be retrieved by a
query. The WHERE clause selects the rows to be included in the query
results by applying a criterion to rows of the database.
<P>
The SQL SELECT statement is used to retrieve data. When SQL is used
interactively, SELECT is the core of most queries. A SELECT statement
operates on a table (or tables) and produces another table containing
the results of the query.
<P>
The SELECT statement specifies the columns you want to retrieve. The
FROM clause specifies the tables in which the columns are located, and
the WHERE clause specifies the rows in the table you want to see. The
basic syntax of the SELECT statement is:
<P>
<PRE>   SELECT columns
   FROM tables
   WHERE search_conditions

</PRE>You must select at least one column and at least one table in order to
have a valid SELECT statement. You can specify more than one column
(and/or table) by separating the column (and/or table) names with a
comma.
<P>
The following is an example of a SELECT statement in its simplest
form:
<P>
<PRE>   SELECT * FROM employee

</PRE>The asterisk refers to all the columns in the referenced tables--in
this case, the Employee table. The above statement is equivalent to:
<P>
<PRE>   SELECT EmpNum, Name, Weight FROM employee

</PRE>Both of these SELECT statements return:
<P>
<PRE>   EmpNum    Name      Weight
   398       Smith     178
   402       Jones     124
   839       Brown     155
   118       Smith     140

</PRE>SELECT is most often used with a number of optional clauses. Most of
the time you'll want to narrow the scope of the query to include a
specific set of columns. For example, if you wanted to view only the
weights of the employees, you would make the following SQL query:
<P>
<PRE>   SELECT weight FROM employee

</PRE>The result is the following:
<P>
<PRE>   Weight
   178
   124
   155
   140

</PRE>You might further narrow your query by adding conditions. SQL uses the
keyword WHERE to specify which of the available records you want. To
list only the names and weights of those employees who weigh more than
150 pounds, use the following SQL query:
<P>
<PRE>   SELECT name, weight FROM employee
   WHERE weight &gt; 150

</PRE>The result is the following:
<P>
<PRE>   Name      Weight
   Brown     155
   Smith     178

</PRE>SQL offers a rich set of search conditions that allow you to specify
many different kinds of queries. Only those rows that evaluate to
TRUE, based on the comparison, are displayed. In addition to "&gt;", all
the comparison operators are supported in SQL Server. They are:
<P>
<PRE>   =    Equal to
   !=   Not equal to
   &lt;    Less than
   &lt;=   Less than or equal to
   &gt;    Greater than
   &gt;=   Greater than or equal to

</PRE>Using the rules of logic, you can join these simple SQL search
conditions to form more complex ones. The search conditions can be
combined using the logical conditions AND, OR, and NOT. For example,
to find all employees who weigh between 150 and 160 pounds, your query
would be:
<P>
<PRE>   SELECT name, weight FROM employee
   WHERE weight &gt;= 150 AND weight &lt;= 160


                     APPENDIX C--EXECUTE EXAMPLES
                     ============================

</PRE>This appendix contains examples of most of the commands documented in
Chapter 11 of the Q+E for Microsoft Excel "User's Guide." We highly
recommend you read Chapter 10 to understand the basic concepts of
dynamic data exchange (DDE) and that you become familiar with the
syntax of the following commands:
<P>
<PRE>   INITIATE()
   REQUEST()
   FETCH()
   EXECUTE()
   TERMINATE()

</PRE>For more information about the syntax of these commands, see the "A
Practical Guide to Q+E, Part I" Application Note (WE0500).
<P>
For this section, the following assumptions have been made:

<UL><LI>QE.EXE is located in a directory listed in your PATH statement.
<LI>You have installed the dBASEFile and ExcelFile drivers.
<LI>The dBASEFile and TextFile drivers are located in a directory
   listed in your PATH statement.
<LI>You have not deleted or modified the following sample files, which
   are located in the QE subdirectory:

<PRE>                      APPENDIX D--OTHER EXAMPLES
                      ==========================

</PRE><h2>STORED PROCEDURES</h2>
 
<P>
Stored procedures are collections of SQL statements and control-of-
flow language. Stored procedures are compiled the first time they are
executed, and their execution plans are stored, dramatically improving
the performance of SQL statements and batch processes.
<P>
There are two ways to execute a stored procedure from inside Q+E:
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1</h3>
 
<P>
Log on to SQL Server. From the File menu, choose Open and choose the
SQL button. You can type an SQL command directly into this dialog box.
For example, type:
<P>
<PRE>      USE pubs; sp_helpjoins 'publishers', 'authors'

</PRE>-or-
<P>
Choose the OK button. Any results generated by the stored procedure
will be returned to a blank query file in Q+E.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 2</h3>
 
<P>
After opening an SQL Server table, choose SQL Query from the Select
menu. Type the command for the stored procedure as shown in the
example above.
<P>
<P><h2>EXECUTING A STORED PROCEDURE FROM A MICROSOFT EXCEL MACRO</h2>
 
<P>
Stored procedures can also be executed as part of a Microsoft Excel
macro. This is done by using the DDE EXECUTE function or by using
QE.XLA add-in macro sheet functions. The following are examples of
both methods:
<P>
<PRE>   =EXECUTE(chan,"[open('use pubs; sp_helpjoins ' ' ' ' '
   authors' ' ')]")

   -or-

   =DB.SQL.QUERY(2,"use pubs; sp_helpjoins ' 'publishers' ' ' '
   authors' '",1,false)
