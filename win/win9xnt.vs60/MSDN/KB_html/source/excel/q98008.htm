The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 2.x, 3.0, 4.0, 4.0a, 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Excel for 0S/2, versions 2.x and 3.0
<LI>Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, versions 2.x, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, some database records are not be visible in the data
form if either of the following conditions apply to any of the cells that
contain the records:

<UL><LI>The cells have a protection status of hidden and worksheet cells
   are protected.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE>
<LI>The column is hidden because it has a column width of zero.
<P>
</UL>The data form, which reads information from the formula bar, cannot read
from or write to cells that are Hidden or that have no column width. This
is expected behavior with cells that are in hidden columns or that have
been hidden by cell protection.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
To have full data form functionality, do the following:

<UL><LI>Format all columns in the database to have a nonzero width with the
   following steps:
<P>
<P><PRE>    1. Select the entire database.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    2. In Microsoft Excel version 5.0, choose Column from the Format menu,
       and then choose Unhide.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       In Microsoft Excel versions 2.x, 3.0 and 4.0, choose Column Width
       from the Format menu, and then choose the Unhide button.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    -and-
</PRE>
<LI>Unhide all cells in the database if the cells on the worksheet are
   protected by using the following appropriate method.
<P>
   Microsoft Excel Version 5.0
   ---------------------------
<P>
   1. From the Tools menu, choose Protection, and then choose Unprotect
<P><PRE>      Sheet. If a password is required to unprotect the sheet, enter the
      password and choose OK.
</PRE><P>
   2. If you want to keep other cells on the worksheet protected, unhide
<P><PRE>      only the cells in the database by taking the following steps:
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       a. Select the entire database. If you plan use the data form to add
<PRE></PRE>          records to the database, you should also select additional cells
          below the database.

       b. From the Format menu, choose Cells. Select the Protection tab.
          Clear the Hidden check box and choose OK.

   3. If you want to protect the worksheet again, choose Protection from
      the Tools menu, and then choose Protect Sheet. In the Protect Sheet
      dialog box, choose OK to protect the worksheet. To keep the rest of
      the worksheet protected, but leave the cells unprotected, clear the
      Contents check box in the Protect Sheet dialog box before you choose
      OK.

   Microsoft Excel versions 2.x, 3.0 and 4.0
   -----------------------------------------

   1. From the Options menu, choose Unprotect Document. If a password is
      required to unprotect the document, enter the password and choose
      OK.

   2. If you want to keep other cells on the worksheet protected, you
      will need to unhide the cells in the database by taking the following
      steps:

       a. Select the entire database. If you plan use the data form to add
          records to the database, you should also select additional cells
          below the database.

       b. From the Format menu, choose Cell Protection. Clear the Hidden
          check box and choose OK.

   3. If you want to protect the worksheet again, choose Protect Document
      from the Options menu. In the dialog box, choose OK to protect the
      worksheet. To keep the rest of the worksheet protected, but leave
      the cells unprotected, clear the Cells check box in the Protect
      Document dialog box before you choose OK.

</PRE></UL>NOTE: If you use a custom data form, you will be able to view data that is
located in zero-width columns. However, as is the case with the standard
data form, you cannot use a custom data form to enter data into hidden
cells and you will not be able to view data that is entered in cells with a
protection status of Hidden when the worksheet cells are protected.
