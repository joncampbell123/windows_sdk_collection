</PRE>The following information applies to Microsoft Excel, versions 3.0 and
4.0.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
 
<P>
This Application Note outlines how to reference cells from a macro and
discusses the A1 and R1C1 reference styles. It includes tables that
define terms such as "absolute reference" and "relative reference" and
contains descriptions of specific macro functions and the types of
cell referencing they will accept.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Excel has a powerful macro language that allows you to
automate frequently performed tasks, customize functions, and create
interactive applications. How you reference a cell is an essential
part of writing a macro; therefore, to write a successful macro, you
must understand the different ways to reference a cell. Macro commands
take either relative or absolute references with respect to a cell, a
range of cells, or defined ranges. There are a variety of ways to
refer to a cell in a macro, depending on whether that cell is on a
macro sheet or a worksheet and depending on which sheet is active when
you execute the macro.
<P>
When you are creating a macro, you'll most often want to refer to a
specific cell (absolute) on a worksheet or to a cell in terms of its
relationship to the active cell (relative). You should be able to
write most macros using absolute references or relative references
that are enclosed in quotation marks.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>DEFINITIONS</h2>
 
<P>
<PRE>   Term         Definition
   ------------------------------------------------------------------
   Absolute     A reference that is fixed. The reference will not be
   reference     changed if it's copied to another cell, if rows are
                inserted above it, or if columns are inserted to the
                left of it.

   Relative     A reference that will be adjusted if it's copied to
   reference    another cell, if rows are inserted above it, or if
                columns are inserted to the left of it.

   Active       The sheet that you last opened or activated. This
   sheet        can occur prior to running the macro or during the
                macro's execution. If you see more than one sheet on
                your display, the title bar of the active sheet
                and/or scroll bars will be a different color than
                the other sheets. If you see only one sheet, the
                active sheet is at the forefront of your display.

   Referencing  Microsoft Excel uses two types of reference styles:
   style        A1 reference style and R1C1 reference style. You can
                use either style by choosing Workspace from the
                Options menu and selecting the R1C1 check box for
                R1C1 style referencing, or leaving the R1C1 check
                box clear for A1 style referencing. In A1 style,
                columns are labeled with letters, and rows are
                labeled with numbers; in R1C1 style, both rows and
                columns are labeled with numbers. There are absolute
                and relative forms of both styles.


</PRE><h2>ABSOLUTE REFERENCES</h2>
 
<P>
When you want your macro to work with specific cells, you should
always use absolute references.
<P>
<PRE>  IMPORTANT: When you are using references that are not enclosed in
  quotation marks, they must be written in the reference style
  currently set for your workspace, either A1 or R1C1. (To set the
  reference style, choose Workspace from the Options menu. For more
  information about reference styles, see the "Referencing Style"
  definition in the "Definitions" section of this Application Note.)
  However, references enclosed in quotation marks must always be in
  R1C1 style regardless of your workspace reference style.

   To enter an absolute         Use this form of   Use this form of
   reference that               A1 style           R1C1 style
   -----------------------------------------------------------------
   Refers to cell A1 on the     $A$1               R1C1
   macro sheet

   Refers to cell A1 on the     !$A$1              !R1C1 or "R1C1"
   active sheet

   Refers to cell A1 on the     Name!$A$1          Name!R1C1 or
   named sheet                                     "Name!R1C1"


</PRE><h2>RELATIVE REFERENCES</h2>
 
<P>
When you enclose a relative reference in quotation marks, the
reference is relative to the active cell on the active sheet while the
macro is running. Relative references without quotation marks are
always relative to the cell containing the macro statement.
<P>
<PRE>  NOTE: When you use a relative reference that is not enclosed in
  quotation marks, make sure that you want this reference to be
  relative to the cell containing the macro statement.

                                                          Use this
   To enter a relative reference that                     reference style
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------
   - Refers to the cell that is one row down and one       "R[1]C[1]"
     column to the right of the active cell on the         "Name!R[1]C[1]"
     active or named sheet.

   - Refers to cell A1 on the macro sheet.                 A1

   - Refers to the cell on the macro sheet that is one     R[1]C[1]
     row down and one column to the right of the macro
     command containing this reference.

   - Refers to cell A1 on the active sheet. The            !A1
     reference, however, is relative to the macro sheet
     cell that contains the reference. It is not
     relative to the active cell on the active sheet. If
     you copy the formula that contains this reference
     to any other cell on the macro sheet, the reference
     will be updated relative to cell A1 on the macro
     sheet. For example, if you copy =SELECT(!A1) in
     cell A5 on your macro sheet and paste it in cell
     A6, !A1 is updated to !A2.

   - Refers to the cell on the active or named sheet       !R[1]C[1]
     that is one row down and one column to the right of   Name!R[1]C[1]
     the macro sheet cell that contains the reference.
     This reference is not relative to the active cell
     on the active sheet.

     For example, if you have GET.FORMULA(!R[1]C[1])
     in cell A5 on the macro sheet, when you run this
     macro while another sheet is active, the formula
     in cell B6 on that sheet is returned regardless
     of the active cell. Because the GET.FORMULA
     function is in cell A5, the reference evaluates
     to B6, one row down and one column to the right
     of A5. Due to the exclamation point and in the
     second case, the filename, Microsoft Excel
     appends the active sheet name or the given sheet
     name to the reference.

  NOTE: A worksheet or another macro sheet must be active when the
  command macro encounters a reference preceded by an exclamation
  point.


</PRE><h2>WORKING WITH REFERENCES THAT ARE ENCLOSED IN QUOTATION MARKS</h2>
 
<P>
A limited number of functions accept references enclosed in quotation
marks, that is, in the form "R1C1" (absolute) or "R[1]C[1]"
(relative). Because they are enclosed in quotation marks, these
references are treated as text and are not evaluated as references
until you run your macro. If you attempt to use this method of
referencing a cell in a function that is not designed to accept it,
you will receive a macro error or incorrect results. For example, the
formula =IF("R1C1"=100) will always return FALSE because "R1C1" is not
evaluated as a reference. Instead, it is evaluated as a literal text
string.
<P>
The following table lists some of the more common functions that can
use absolute ("R1C1") and/or relative ("R[1]C[1]") references.
<P>
<PRE>   Function   Description
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------
   SELECT()   Can use both absolute and relative references in this style.

   TEXTREF()  Can use both absolute and relative references in this style.

   ABSREF()   Can use relative references only ("R[1]C[1]").

   FORMULA()  Can use both absolute and relative references in this style.


</PRE>TEXTREF() is an extremely useful function because in most cases in
which a function is not designed to accept a reference enclosed in
quotation marks, TEXTREF() can convert the cell reference to the style
of reference currently set for the workspace. For example, you can use
the formula =IF(TEXTREF("R1C1")=100) in your macro to evaluate the
IF() statement correctly. If cell A1 contains the value 100, the
function will return TRUE.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>TIPS FOR USING THE SELECT() FUNCTION</h2>
 
<P>
Most macros need to select a particular cell or a range of cells in
order to perform a certain task, whether it be to select a range of
cells so they can be copied and pasted to a new range or to select one
cell and determine what value that cell holds. The following table
includes some tips for selecting cells from within a macro.
<P>
<PRE>               Use this
To do this     function          Explanation
</PRE> 
<PRE>Select cell    =SELECT(!$A$1)    =SELECT(Name!$A$1) or =SELECT(Name!A1)
A1 on the      =SELECT(!A1)      will attempt to select cell A1 on the
active sheet   -or-              named sheet. If this sheet is not the
                =SELECT("R1C1")  active worksheet, this command will
                                 result in a macro error. Because SELECT()
                                 will work only on the active worksheet,
                                 it is not necessary to specify a filename.
                                 Each of the listed functions will select
                                 cell A1 on the active sheet.

Select cell    =SELECT(A1)       If the macro sheet is not the active
A1 on the                        sheet, this will result in a macro
macro sheet                      error.


Select cell    =SELECT("R1C1")   =SELECT(R1C1) without the reference
R1C1 on the                      enclosed in quotation marks will select
currently                        R1C1 only on the macro sheet and only if
active                           you are using the R1C1 reference style.
</PRE>worksheet
<P>
<PRE>Return         External          Activating worksheets and selecting cells
information    references        can cause a macro to run slowly. Rather
about a        or the            than select a cell, you can use functions
particular     OFFSET()          to derive needed information about that
cell or        function          cell and/or its contents. For example, to
range of                         return the value in the cell that is one
cells                            row below and one column to the right of
                                 the active cell, use
                                 =OFFSET(ACTIVE.CELL(),1,1) instead of
                                 =SELECT("R[1]C[1]").

Make a         FORMULA.GOTO()    =FORMULA.GOTO(Name!$A$1) or
selection on                     =FORMULA.GOTO("Name!R1C1") will activate
a sheet that                     the named worksheet and select cell A1.

<P>
<P>
<P><h2>MACRO DEBUGGING</h2>
 
<P>
Most command-equivalent macro functions return the value FALSE before
they are run, TRUE if they are run successfully, and FALSE or an error
value if they don't run successfully. If your macro functions are
returning an incorrect or unexpected result or if one or more macro
commands cause your macro to halt in error, you can use any
combination of the following methods to isolate and resolve the
problem.
<P>
<P><h3>Use the Step and Evaluate Commands</h3>
 
<P>
The step feature allows you to step through and evaluate your macro
commands line by line. To use the step feature, run your macro by
choosing Run from the Macro menu. After you select your macro from the
list, choose the Step button. You can then either step through or
evaluate the individual lines of your macro code. Step takes you to
the next macro command. Evaluate calculates each nested function
within a line of macro code, one argument at a time--this is a useful
way to isolate a problem within a specific line of a macro. While you
are in step mode, you cannot edit your macro. To exit step mode and
edit your macro, choose the Halt button.
<P>
<P><h3>Use Key Commands to Evaluate Portions of a Macro Statement</h3>
 
<P>
To evaluate a portion of a statement or an entire line of code in your
macro in the formula bar, select the area you want to evaluate and
press F9 or, if you are using Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh(R),
press and hold down the COMMAND key and then press the EQUAL SIGN (=)
key. Microsoft Excel will immediately calculate the selected portion
of your function and display the value in the formula bar.
<P>
<PRE>  CAUTION: Be sure to press the ESC key after you view the value;
  otherwise the original formula will be replaced with the displayed
  value.

</PRE><h3>Use Key Commands to View Values Returned by Macro Statements</h3>
 
<P>
To view the value returned by all statements on a macro sheet, press
and hold down the CTRL key, or the COMMAND key if you are using
Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, and then press the ACCENT GRAVE (`)
key. CTRL+ACCENT GRAVE (Windows) or COMMAND+ACCENT GRAVE (Macintosh)
toggles between the view values mode and the view formulas mode.
Another way to toggle between view values and view formulas is to
choose Display from the Options menu and select or clear the Formula
check box (when a macro sheet is active, the default view is view
formulas).
<P>
<P><h3>Run a Portion of the Macro</h3>
 
<P>
If your macro is long, you may want to test small portions of it to
isolate problems. To divide your macro into more manageable sections,
do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Activate your macro sheet. At the end of the range of macro code
   that you want to test, insert a row and type =HALT(). This will
   stop the macro's execution at this point in the macro.

<P><LI>Activate the document from which you are running your macro and
   choose Run from the Macro menu.

<P><LI>With the dialog box active, choose the macro sheet name from the
   Window menu and select the cell containing the first line of macro
   code that you want to test. This will place the macro cell
   reference in the Run Macro dialog box.

<P><LI>Choose OK or Step.
<P>
</OL>The macro will stop where it encounters the HALT() function.
<P>
