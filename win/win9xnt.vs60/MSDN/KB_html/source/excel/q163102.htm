The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you attempt to open an attached file is routed to you in an e-mail
message, you may receive the following message
<P>
<PRE>   &lt;filename&gt;: file format is not valid

</PRE>where &lt;filename&gt; is the name of the file you are trying to open.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>The file is sent to you using the routing slip feature in a version
   of Microsoft Excel that is newer than the version you are using.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -and-
</PRE>
<LI>You attempt to open the file in a version of Microsoft Excel that is
   earlier than the version of Microsoft Excel from which file is routed.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
In order to use the routing features of Microsoft Excel, route from the
same version of Excel in which the recipients are using. If you only
want to send the workbook to all recipients at once without tracking or
notification of returning, just save the workbook in the file type that
the recipient's version of Microsoft Excel will recognize and attach the
file to an e-mail message and send it.
<P>
Method 1: Use the Same Version of Excel
 
To work around this problem, use the same version of Microsoft Excel from
which the file is routed. This way the routing features can be used.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 2: Manually Send an E-mail Attachment</h3>
 
If your goal is to route the workbook to all recipients at once, not to
track status, and not to return the workbook to you when done (all the
advanced features of Microsoft Excel Routing), follow the steps below:

<OL><P><LI>Click Save As from the File menu and click the appropriate file
   format from the Save as type dropdown list.

<P><LI>Change the file name in the File name edit box to avoid
   replacing your original file and click Save. Note the folder
   where the file is saved.

<P><LI>Start your e-mail program.

<P><LI>Open a new message in your e-mail program. This step will vary
   according to the e-mail program (e.g. In Microsoft Windows
   Messaging, click New Message from the Compose menu).

<P><LI>Attach the workbook to the new message. This step will vary
   according to the e-mail program (e.g. In Microsoft Windows
   Messaging, click File from the Insert menu and find the file
   and click OK).

<P><LI>Type your text, specify the recipients, and send the message.
<P>
<P>
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you route a workbook in Microsoft Excel, the workbook is always routed
in the workbook format for the version of Microsoft Excel you are using.
For example, if you route a workbook using Microsoft Excel 97, the workbook
is sent using the Microsoft Excel 97 format.
<P>
<P><h3>Example</h3>
 
<P>
For example, assume you route a workbook to a group of users and you are
running Microsoft Excel 97. The following table lists the users that appear
on the routing slip and the versions of Microsoft Excel they are using:
<P>
<PRE>   User   Version
   --------------------------

   John   Microsoft Excel 97
   Mary   Microsoft Excel 7.0
   Sue    Microsoft Excel 7.0
   Tom    Microsoft Excel 97
   Dave   Microsoft Excel 7.0

</PRE></OL>John and Tom can open the routed workbook, save changes, and route the
workbook to the next user. However, Mary, Sue, and Dave cannot open the
file. They receive the error message described in this article.
