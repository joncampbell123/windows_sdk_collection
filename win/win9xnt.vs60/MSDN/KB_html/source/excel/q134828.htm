The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you open a new file from a template, the assigned filename of the new
file may not result in a filename that is incremented one greater than the
last file opened from that template.
<P>
For example, the first workbook opened from "Testfile.xlt" is assigned the
name "Testfile1." If "Testfile1" is then closed and a second workbook is
opened from the "Testfile" template, it too is assigned the name
"Testfile1."
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Where sequential filenames are required, use any of the following methods.
<P>
Method 1: Do not close files created from a template until all files to be
<PRE>          created from that template are opened.

</PRE>Method 2: Use the Save As command on the File menu to rename the files to
<PRE>          their correct numbers.

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In earlier versions of Microsoft Excel and in other Microsoft Office for
Windows 95 applications, when you open a new file from a template, the name
assigned to the new file is the name of the template followed by a number.
That number starts at 1 for the first file opened from a particular
template ("testfile1" for example) and is incremented by one for all
subsequent files opened from that template ("testfile2","testfile3") for as
long as that application is open. In Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, the
number assigned to a new file opened from a template is the lowest number
not currently in use for that particular file/template name.
