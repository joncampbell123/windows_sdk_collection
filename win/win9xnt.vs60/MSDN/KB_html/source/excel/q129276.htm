<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, when you save or close a shared workbook, you may
receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   File is locked. Please try again.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior may occur when the shared workbook is open in Microsoft Quick
View or when you are attempting to save the workbook while another user is
opening the file in Microsoft Excel.
<P>
<P><h3>Case 1: The Shared Workbook Is Open in Microsoft Quick View</h3>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs if the file you are saving or closing is open in
Microsoft Quick View. Quick View is a program that is included with
Microsoft Windows 95. Quick View allows you to view a document without
opening it in the program that was used to create the document.
<P>
When you open a nonshared file in Microsoft Excel, you cannot open the same
file in Microsoft Quick View because the file is locked by Microsoft
Excel. However, when you open a shared file in Microsoft Excel, the file is
not locked (to allow sharing), and you can view it in Microsoft Quick
View. When you save or close a shared file in Microsoft Excel, Microsoft
Excel locks the file for saving. If you save or close a shared file in
Microsoft Excel while the file is open in Quick View, you receive the error
message in the "Symptoms" section because the file is locked by Quick View
in this case.
<P>
NOTE: If you open a shared file in Microsoft Excel, set the file attributes
to read-only (from the folder window that contains the file) while the file
is still open, and then save or close the file, the error message appears.
<P>
<P><h3>Case 2: Another User Has Opened the Shared Workbook</h3>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs when you save a shared workbook and another user has
already opened the workbook. The error message may also appear if you share
a file while another user is opening the file because sharing a file
requires that you save it.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this behavior, use the appropriate following method.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1: The Shared Workbook Is Open in Microsoft Quick View</h3>
 
<P>
Close the file in Quick View before you attempt to save the shared
workbook.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 2: Another User Has Opened the Shared Workbook</h3>
 
<P>
Wait a few minutes and save the file again. The number of minutes to wait
depends on the size of the file and how long it takes to open the file. As
soon as the file is opened on the other user's computer, you can
successfully save the file without receiving the error message.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In Quick View, when you open a nonshared workbook file that is currently
open in Microsoft Excel, you receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   The file &lt;filename&gt; can not be opened for Quick View. It may be opened
   or locked by another application or you may not have access to it.

</PRE>When you open a file in Microsoft Excel, the file is opened exclusively
whether the file is shared or not. After you open the file, if the file
is shared, the file is considered nonexclusive. If you attempt to save a
file in Microsoft Excel while another user is opening the file (another
instance of Microsoft Excel is reading the same file), your instance
of Microsoft Excel is unable to lock the file to save it, and you receive
the error message described in this section.
