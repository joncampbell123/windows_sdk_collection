The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After you upgrade an earlier version of Microsoft Excel to Excel 97 and run
a macro from your Personal macro workbook (Personal.xls), the following
error message appears:
<P>
<PRE>   Personal.xls could not be found. Check the Spelling of the file name,
   and verify that the file location is correct.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when you do the following:

<UL><LI>You upgrade an earlier version of Excel to Excel 97.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -and-
</PRE>
<LI>You install Excel 97 into a folder that is different from the folder
   that contains the earlier version.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this problem, copy the Personal.xls file from the Xlstart
folder, which is in the folder that contains the earlier version of Excel,
to the following new folder:
<P>
<PRE>   Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\Xlstart

</PRE>To use the Personal.xls file, which you used with the earlier version of
Excel, in Excel 97, use either of the following methods.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1: Use Windows Explorer</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>In Windows Explorer, open the Xlstart folder in the folder that contains
   the earlier version of Excel, click the Personal.xls file, and then
   click Copy on the Edit menu.

<P><LI>Open the Excel 97 Xlstart folder and click Paste on the Edit menu to
   paste the file into the folder.
<P>
   By default the new Xlstart folder is located in the following folder
<P>
<P><PRE>      C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\Xlstart
</PRE><P>
   unless you changed the destination folder for Excel 97 when you
   installed it.
<P>
</OL><h3>Method 2: Use Excel 97</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>In Excel 97, open the Personal.xls file.
<P>
   NOTE: The file is hidden when you open it. To unhide the file, click
   Unhide on the Window menu.

<P><LI>Click Save As on the File menu. Open the new Xlstart folder.
<P>
   By default this folder is located in the following folder
<P>
<P><PRE>      C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\Xlstart
</PRE><P>
   unless you changed the destination folder for Excel 97 when you
   installed it.

<P><LI>After you save the file, hide the workbook by clicking Hide on the
   Window menu. Quit Excel. When you are prompted to save changes in the
   Personal Macro Workbook, click Yes.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you upgrade to Excel 97 and install it in a different folder than the
folder that contains the earlier version of Excel, the Personal Macro
Workbook (Personal.xls) is not moved to the new Xlstart folder for Excel
97. When you start Excel 97, the Unhide command on the Window menu is
dimmed, which indicates that no hidden Personal.xls exists. If you have any
macro or toolbar buttons that run macros that are stored in the
Personal.xls workbook, the error message in the "Symptoms" section in this
article appears.
<P>
NOTE: The only file that is moved from an existing Xlstart folder is the
custom charts file, Xl5galry.xls.
