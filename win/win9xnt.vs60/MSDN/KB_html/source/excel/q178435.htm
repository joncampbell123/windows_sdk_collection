The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition, cells that contain formulas that
refer to user-defined functions may return a #VALUE! error after you run a
Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications macro or perform any action that
causes the worksheet that contains the formulas to be recalculated.
<P>
Also, if a Visual Basic subroutine is running when the formulas are
recalculated, the subroutine may stop without warning.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
These problems may occur if an error occurs in a user-defined function
while the worksheet is recalculated.
<P>
For an example of this problem, see the "More Information" section of this
article.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft provides programming examples for illustration only, without
warranty either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the
implied warranties of merchantability and/or fitness for a particular
purpose. This article assumes that you are familiar with the programming
language being demonstrated and the tools used to create and debug
procedures. Microsoft support engineers can help explain the functionality
of a particular procedure, but they will not modify these examples to
provide added functionality or construct procedures to meet your specific
needs. If you have limited programming experience, you may want to contact
the Microsoft fee-based consulting line at (800) 936-5200. For more
information about the support options available from Microsoft, please see
the following page on the World Wide Web:
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/support/supportnet/refguide/default.asp">http://www.microsoft.com/support/supportnet/refguide/default.asp</A></B>

</PRE>To work around this problem, press COMMAND+SHIFT+F9 to force the values to
be recalculated. When you do this, any formulas that refer to user-defined
functions are recalculated correctly.
<P>
To prevent this problem from occurring, add error-handling code to your
user-defined function, as in the following example:
<P>
<PRE>   Function MyFunction(CellRange As Object) As String
       On Error GoTo ErrorHandler                       'new line
       If CellRange.Interior.Pattern = xlNone Then
           MyFunction = "yes"
       Else
           MyFunction = "no"
       End If
       Exit Function                                    'new line
   ErrorHandler:                                        'new line
       MyFunction = "error"                             'new line
   End Function

</PRE>In this user-defined function, the line "On Error GoTo ErrorHandler" causes
the function to continue if an error occurs. In this case, the error-
handling code causes the function to return a value of "error", instead of
"yes" or "no" or #VALUE!. After the formulas return "error", press
COMMAND+SHIFT+F9 to recalculate the worksheet.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition, if a user-defined function returns
an error value, the formula that called the user-defined function and any
other formulas that call the same user-defined function may fail to be
recalculated properly. When this happens, the formulas may return a #VALUE!
error.
<P>
Also, if the user-defined function returns an error value, any running
Visual Basic subroutine that caused the recalculation to occur may stop.
This may cause problems if the subroutine is running unattended.
<P>
To see examples of these problems, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>In Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition, create a new workbook.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, point to Macro, and then click Visual Basic Editor.
   On the Insert menu, click Module.

<P><LI>Type the following code into the new module:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Function MyFunction(CellRange As Object) As String
</PRE><P>
<PRE>          ' This line will fail when you delete a row from the worksheet.
          If CellRange.Interior.Pattern = xlNone Then
              MyFunction = "yes"
          Else
              MyFunction = "no"
          End If
      End Function

      Sub TestDelete()
          Rows(2).Delete    ' Deleting a row forces recalculation.
          MsgBox "Delete succeeded."
      End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>On the File menu, click "Close and Return to Microsoft Excel."

<P><LI>Select cells A10:A12 in the worksheet. Type the following formula:
<P>
<P><PRE>      =MyFunction(C10)
</PRE><P>
   and press CTRL+RETURN.
<P>
   All three cells (A10, A11, A12) display the value "yes".

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, point to Macro, and then click Macros. Select
   TestDelete, and then click Run.
<P>
   Note that the three cells (A9, A10, A11) display the #VALUE! error
   value. Note also that the message box in the TestDelete subroutine is
   not displayed.

<P><LI>Press COMMAND+SHIFT+F9.
<P>
   The three formulas are recalculated correctly.
<P>
</OL>If you use the MyFunction function in the "Workaround" section of this
article, the formulas do not return a #VALUE! error value when you run the
TestDelete subroutine, and the message box in TestDelete is displayed
correctly. However, you still must press COMMAND+SHIFT+F9 to force the
formulas to display the correct value, which is "yes".
