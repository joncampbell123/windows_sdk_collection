<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, versions 7.0, 7.0a
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0c
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, when you use the Add-Ins dialog box, you may receive
the error message "Cannot access '&lt;FILENAME.XLA&gt;'" when you do one or both
of the following:

<UL><LI>Choose Add-Ins from the Tools menu. In this case,
   &lt;FILENAME.XLA&gt; is the filename of an add-in you created that is
   currently loaded.

<LI>Use the Add-Ins dialog box to remove an installed add-in. In
   this case, &lt;FILENAME.XLA&gt; is the filename of the add-in that you
   selected for removal from the Add-Ins dialog box.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This error message appears when you display the Add-Ins dialog box, and/or
when you clear the check box next to an add-in in the Add-Ins dialog box.
This problem may occur after you have installed an application that uses
version 2.02 of STORAGE.DLL, such as the Microsoft Access version 2.0
Service Pack, or the Microsoft ODBC version 2.0 Driver Kit.
<P>
If you create an add-in and load it, this problem occurs when you open the
Add-Ins dialog box after exiting and starting Microsoft Excel again. After
you receive the error message, the add-in that corresponds to the file
listed in the error message does not appear in the Add-Ins Available list
in the Add-Ins dialog box. This problem only occurs with add-ins that you
have created, not with add-ins that are installed by Microsoft Excel.
<P>
The error message only appears when you remove an add-in if you install and
then remove an add-in in the same session of Microsoft Excel. If you
install an add-in, and then exit Microsoft Excel, you do not receive this
error message when you remove the add-in during a later session of
Microsoft Excel. Additionally, when you choose Cancel for the error message
that appears, the add-in is removed as expected.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Version 2.03 of the Storage.dll file corrects this problem. This .dll is
available in the Application Note "OLE Version 2.03" (WW1116). For
additional information, please see the following article(s) in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../win3x/q123087.htm">Q123087</A></B>
   TITLE     : WW1116: OLE Version 2.03

</PRE><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, use the appropriate procedure below:

<UL><LI>If you receive this error message when you open the Add-Ins dialog box,
   the information necessary for loading the add-in is removed from the
   EXCEL5.INI file when you close Microsoft Excel. Steps 1-4 below are
   necessary in order for the add-in file to be referenced in the
   EXCEL5.INI file again.
<P>
   1. Close Microsoft Excel, and then start Microsoft Excel again.
<P>
   2. From the Tools menu, choose Add-Ins.
<P>
   3. In the list of Add-ins Available, select the check box next to any
<P><PRE>      add-ins that you want to load, and choose OK.
</PRE>
<LI>If you receive this error message when you remove an add-in from the
   Add-Ins dialog box, use any of the following methods to work around this
   problem:
<P>
   Method 1: In the dialog box that contains the error message described
<PRE>             above, choose Cancel. The add-in that you removed in the
             Add-Ins dialog box is removed as expected (even though you
             receive the error message).

   Method 2: To avoid receiving this error message, close Microsoft Excel
             before you remove an add-in that you installed during the
             current session of Microsoft Excel.

</PRE></UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem with version 2.02 of
STORAGE.DLL and the Microsoft products listed at the beginning of this
article. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
NOTE: An additional symptom that occurs as a result of this problem is that
the description that normally appears in the Add-Ins dialog box when you
select an add-in may not appear. For example, when you select the ODBC add-
in either to install or remove it, the following description appears in the
Add-Ins dialog box:
<P>
<PRE>   Lets you use ODBC functions to connect to external data sources
   directly.

</PRE>However, when you clear the ODBC Add-In check box after installing the add-
in the same Microsoft Excel session, the description may not appear if
version 2.02 of the STORAGE.DLL file is installed on your computer.
