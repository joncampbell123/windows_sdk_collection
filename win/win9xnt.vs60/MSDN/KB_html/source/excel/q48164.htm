<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Data Form definition table does not return the results indicated
on page 164 of the "Microsoft Excel Reference" version 2.2 manual.
These discrepancies include the following:

<OL><P><LI>The words "Invoice Management System" do not appear at the top
   of the dialog box.

<P><LI>The dashed underline above the Total Due amount does not appear.

<P><LI>Number and Date formatting may not appear correctly when Data Form
   is selected.

<P><LI>Edit box titles may not be underlined to indicate quick keystroke
   commands.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Excel 2.20 looks to the first row in the dialog box description table
for dialog box characteristics such as position, size, and name.
Because the dialog box on page 164 does not have such a reference
line, it must be added to the descriptor table.
<P>
To duplicate the dialog box displayed on page 165, enter the title for
the dialog box "INVOICE1" in cell P5 of the worksheet. This
information must then be defined as part of the dialog box descriptor
by highlighting cells K5:Q21, choosing Define Name from the Formula
menu, and entering the name Data_Form.
<P>
The dashed underline does not appear because the height is not
sufficient for display. To correct this problem, type 18 in cell O19.
<P>
A Custom Data Form in Excel 2.20 only allows the use of Text Edit
boxes in the dialog box. These Edit boxes take their formatting from
the Database fields in the way they appear in the Formula Bar.
<P>
For example, if the date 9/22/88 is entered into the Database, the
Formula Bar displays 9/22/1988. When Data Form is selected, 9/22/1988
appears in the Date Edit box. In the same manner, if 3,299.00 is
entered into the Amount field of the Database, 3,299 is displayed in
the Formula Bar and, thus, in the Edit box for Amount. New data is
accepted when typed into the Data Form with the desired formatting;
however, the Data Form may not open that way.
<P>
Excel 2.20 looks to the setting for Command Underline under the
Options menu, Workspace command when displaying dialog boxes.
<P>
If Command Underline is set On, the specified keystroke is underlined
whenever a dialog box is displayed. When set to Off, the keystroke is
not underlined. When set to Automatic, Command Underline is
implemented only when the Alternate Menu key is used.
