The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition, no Center Across Columns button
appears on the Formatting toolbar. Instead, a Merge And Center toolbar
button appears.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Although the Center Across Columns toolbar button is no longer available,
you can center text across columns without merging cells. To do this,
follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Select the range of cells over which you want to center text.

<P><LI>On the Format menu, click Cells. Click the Alignment tab.

<P><LI>In the Horizontal list box, select Center Across Selection.

<P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design of Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Merge And Center toolbar button in Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition
provides a level of functionality that is very similar to the functionality
that is provided by the Center Across Columns toolbar button in earlier
versions of Microsoft Excel. Basically, the button allows you to center
information in a single cell across a range of cells.
<P>
Note that there are some minor differences in behavior between the two
buttons. The following examples illustrate these differences.
<P>
<P><h3>Examples</h3>
 
<P>
Assume that you have created a new worksheet in Microsoft Excel that
contains the following information:
<P>
<PRE>   A1: test
   A2: hello

</PRE></OL>In Microsoft Excel 5.0, if you select the range A1:E1 and click the Center
Across Columns toolbar button, the word "test" appears centered across the
range A1:E1, and the gridlines between the cells disappear. However, the
range consists of five individual cells.
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition, if you select the range A1:E1 and
click the Merge And Center toolbar button, the range A1:E1 is merged into a
single cell. The word "test" appears centered within this cell.
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 5.0, if you select the range A1:E2 and click the Center
Across Columns toolbar button, the word "test" appears centered across the
range A1:E1, and the word "hello" appears centered across the range A2:E2.
The gridlines between cells in these two smaller ranges disappears. The
range consists of ten individual cells.
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition, if you select the range A1:E2 and
click the Merge And Center toolbar button, the entire range A1:E2 is merged
into a single cell. The word "test" appears centered within this cell. In
addition, because merging cells removes the contents of all cells within
the range except for the upper leftmost cell, you receive the following
message:
<P>
<PRE>   The selection contains multiple data values. Merging into one cell
   will keep the upper-left most data only.

</PRE>If you click OK, the word "hello" is deleted and the cells are merged. If
you click Cancel, the merge and center process is cancelled.
<P>
If the other cells in the range must retain their contents, or if you
want to center multiple rows of information, use the workaround in this
article to format the cells with the Center Across Selection alignment.
