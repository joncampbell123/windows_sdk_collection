The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 3.0, 4.0, 4.0a, 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If you are running Microsoft Excel from a network drive, and you attempt to
run the Microsoft Excel tutorial (also called Computer Based Training or
CBT), you may experience one of the following problems:

<UL><LI>If you are using Microsoft Excel version 5.0, you may receive one of the
   following error messages:
<P>
<P><PRE>      EXCELCBT not found
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      -or-
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      The path in your EXCEL5.INI file does not include the directory that
      contains the CBT files.  Edit the EXCEL5.INI file by typing the path
      of the CBT directory on the CBTLOCATION=line under [Microsoft Excel].
</PRE>
<LI>If you are using Microsoft Excel version 4.0 or 4.0a, you may
   receive the following error message:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Cannot run tutorial. There may be another instance of tutorial
      active.
</PRE>
<LI>If you are using Microsoft Excel version 3.0, the tutorial may fail
   without any error message.
<P>
</UL>This problem will occur if you connected to a network resource using the
universal naming convention (UNC) rather than by specifying a drive letter.
For example, if the command line in the File Properties box for your
Microsoft Excel icon is,
<P>
<PRE>  server\sharename\netdir\EXCEL.EXE (UNC)

</PRE>rather than,
<P>
<PRE>  G:\netdir\EXCEL.EXE

</PRE>the tutorial fails in Microsoft Excel versions 3.0 and 4.0 and you may
receive one of the error messages listed above if you are running Microsoft
Excel version 4.0 or 5.0.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1, you can use UNCs for
entries in Program Item Properties, Program Group Properties, PIF command
lines, and File Manager. UNCs allow you to use a network resource without
formally connecting to it (you can do this by typing the MS-DOS "NET USE"
command).
<P>
The Microsoft Excel tutorial does not currently support the use of UNCs.
This problem also occurs with other tutorial programs, such as the
Microsoft Word for Windows tutorial.
<P>
<P><h3>Workaround</h3>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, follow the procedure appropriate for your
version of Microsoft Excel:
<P>
<PRE>   If you are using Microsoft Excel version 4.0a or 5.0:

   - Set the CBTLOCATION= switch in the EXCEL4.INI (version 4.0a) or the
     EXCEL5.INI (version 5.0) file to a specific drive letter. For example,
     if your Program Item Properties reads

        servername\sharename\exceldir\EXCEL.EXE

     add the following line to the [Microsoft Excel] section of your
     EXCEL4.INI or EXCEL5.INI:

        CBTLOCATION=G:\exceldir

      Note: The drive letter you specify must be the one that your
      workstation is connected to and CBTLOCATION must be in all
      capital letters for the setting to work.

     This method allows you to continue to use the UNC in the Program
     Item Properties for the Microsoft Excel icon.

   If you are using Microsoft Excel version 3.0, 4.0, 4.0a, or 5.0:

    - Connect to the network drive where Microsoft Excel is located
      and use that drive letter on the command line in the Program
      Item Properties for the Microsoft Excel icon. For example:

         G:\netdir\EXCEL.EXE

</PRE>Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here as
it becomes available.
