<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In the versions of Microsoft Excel that are listed at the beginning of this
article, if you click the Close button (the box with an "X") in a workbook,
nothing happens; you are not prompted to save the workbook, and the
workbook is not closed.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when you are editing a cell (you are in edit mode) and
you click the Close button.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, click Close on the File menu.
<P>
Or, exit edit mode by pressing ESCAPE. When you click the Close button,
Microsoft Excel closes workbook.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel for Windows, the Close button is the "X" button located
in the upper-right corner of the workbook window. Note that this button is
different from the "X" button that is located in the upper-right corner of
the program window.
<P>
In Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, the Close button is the square button
located in the upper-left corner of the workbook window.
<P>
Normally, when you click the Close button, Microsoft Excel behaves as
though you clicked Close on the File menu. If the workbook has been
changed, you are prompted to save changes to the file. Then, the workbook
is closed.
