The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the File Conversion Wizard in Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh
Edition and you click Select in either the "File Conversion Wizard - Step 1
of 3" or the "File Conversion Wizard - Step 3 of 3" dialog box, the dialog
box that appears may be confusing and difficult to use.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs because the wizard uses a standard system dialog box
instead of a customized dialog box when you click Select.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, use the appropriate method.
<P>
<P><h3>You Click Select in Step 1 of the Wizard</h3>
 
<P>
The File Conversion Wizard displays the Select A Document dialog box even
when you are selecting a folder. To use the dialog box, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Use the list box and the pop-up menu (above the list box) to select
   the folder you want to use.

<P><LI>Within the folder, select any file. Then, click Select.
<P>
</OL>Note that if you click Select when a folder is selected in the list, that
folder is opened. To actually use the selected folder, you must select a
file in the folder, and then click Select.
<P>
<P><h3>You Click Select in Step 3 of the Wizard</h3>
 
<P>
The File Conversion Wizard displays the Save As dialog box even when you
are selecting a folder. To use the dialog box, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Use the list box and the pop-up menu (above the list box) to select
   the folder you want to use.

<P><LI>Click Save.
<P>
</OL>Note that changing the Save As box or the Save File As Type list has no
effect.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The File Conversion Wizard, which is included in the Microsoft Office 98
Macintosh Edition Value Pack, is designed to help you convert files from
one format to another in Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition. After you
install the File Conversion Wizard, you can use it by pointing to Wizard on
the Tools menu and clicking File Conversion.
<P>
By default, the File Conversion Wizard assumes that the files you want to
convert are stored in the Microsoft Office 98 folder on your hard disk. The
wizard also assumes that you want to save your converted files in the same
folder.
<P>
You can change the folders that are used by clicking Select in either step
1 or step 3 of the wizard. When you click Select, the following commands
are used to display the folder selection dialog boxes.
<P>
<PRE>   Click Select Button in     Command Used
   --------------------------------------------------------

   Step 1 dialog box          Application.GetOpenFileName
   Step 3 dialog box          Application.GetSaveAsFileName

</PRE></OL>Note that these commands are designed to be used with file names, not
folders. Therefore, it may be confusing to use these dialog boxes to select
folders.
