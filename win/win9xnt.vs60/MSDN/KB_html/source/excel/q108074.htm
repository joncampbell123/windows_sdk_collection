<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In a Microsoft Visual Basic application, if you use the GetObject
function with a filename to activate a file in Microsoft Excel, you
may receive the following error message in Microsoft Excel:
<P>
<PRE>   Book1.xls is already open. Reopening will cause your changes to be
   discarded. Do you want to reopen?

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the GetObject function with a filename to activate a
workbook in Microsoft Excel, the file is opened, whether or not the
file is already open. If the file is already open, and contains
changes you have not saved, the above error message is returned.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To activate the workbook BOOK1.XLS as an object linking and embedding (OLE)
Automation object and avoid opening BOOK1.XLS if it is already open, do the
following:

<OL><P><LI>Activate the Microsoft Excel Application object.

<P><LI>Check for an open workbook called BOOK1.XLS.

<P><LI>Activate BOOK1.XLS if it is open.
<P>
   -or-
<P>
   Open BOOK1.XLS if it is not open.
<P>
</OL>The following sample code demonstrates the workaround described above. The
code scans the open workbooks in Microsoft Excel and activates BOOK1.XLS if
it is open.

<P>
You can use the Visual Basic GetObject function to access an OLE
automation object and assign the object to an object variable. You
can then use the object variable to reference the OLE automation
object in your Visual Basic code.
