<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Duration is a measure of the sensitivity of a bond's price to changes
in interest rates. A bond with a high duration will tend to be highly
sensitive to a change in interest rates. It is the preferred measure
used by portfolio investment managers to evaluate what types of bonds
they should include in a portfolio for a given investment objective.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Example</h3>
 
<P>
The example below outlines a method to calculate duration in Microsoft
Excel. Consider the following bond for which dividends are paid
annually:
<P>
<PRE>   Par value               = $1,000
   Annual coupon rate      = 8 percent
   Term to maturity        = 3 years
   Yield to Maturity       = 10 percent

</PRE>Create a worksheet as follows:
<P>
<PRE>A1:Per. B1:CFlow C1:PV(CFlow)        D1:PV % of Price E1:A*D
A2:1    B2:80    C2:=-PV(10%,A2,,B2) D2:=C2/$C$5      E2:=A2*D2
A3:2    B3:80    C3:=-PV(10%,A3,,B3) D3:=C3/$C$5      E3:=A3*D3
A4:3    B4:1080  C4:=-PV(10%,A4,,B4) D4:=C4/$C$5      E4:=A4*D4
A5:     B5:PRICE C5:=SUM(C2:C4)      D5:DURATION      E5:=SUM(E2:E4)

</PRE>The value for "duration" will be in cell E5.
<P>
Duration is a weighted average time to full recovery of principal and
interest payments from a bond. It is calculated as follows by dividing
the summation of the present value of the cash flows, multiplied by
the time period over which the cash flow occurs, multiplied by the
price of the bond.
<P>
The price of the bond is in cell C5. The present value of the cash
flows divided by the price of the bond is in cells D2:D4. This value
multiplied by the time period over which the cash flow occurs is in
cells E2:E4. The duration, which is the sum of the values in cells
E2:E4, is in cell E5.
