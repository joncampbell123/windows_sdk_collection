The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 4.0, 4.0a, 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, if you copy an empty worksheet to a new or existing
workbook, and you have changed the row height on the worksheet, the
worksheet rows revert to the standard row height in the copy of the
worksheet. Additionally, even if the worksheet contains information,
certain rows on the worksheet may revert to the standard row height when
you copy the sheet.
<P>
In Microsoft Excel version 4.0, this behavior occurs if you create a
copy of a worksheet that is contained in a workbook by dragging the
worksheet from the workbook table of contents while pressing the CTRL
key.
<P>
Note that if you copy an empty worksheet to a new or existing
workbook, the column width changes you have made to the worksheet are
maintained.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs when you do not have information within every 16
rows on the worksheet. For example, if you have information within
the first 16 rows on the worksheet, all row height changes within
these 16 rows is maintained when you copy the worksheet. However,
rows 17 through 32 revert to the standard row height if there is no
information contained in rows 17-32.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To avoid having the row height in your worksheet change to the
standard row height, do either of the following:

<UL><LI>Enter at least one character within every 16 rows (of the rows that do
   not have the standard row height and do not contain information) on your
   worksheet before you copy the worksheet. You can then delete the
   unnecessary text after you copy the worksheet.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Copy the worksheet to another workbook before you change the row height.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in
Microsoft Excel for Windows version 5.0c.
