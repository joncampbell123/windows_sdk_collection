<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Excel can call routines that have been compiled as code
resources (sometimes referred to as dynamic link libraries, or DLLs).
<P>
A CODE resource to be called from Excel can be created in any language
that compiles the routine as a resource of type CODE. The resource
must use Pascal conventions for passing arguments (this is standard).
<P>
When Excel calls a CODE resource, it first carries out the MAIN
function. If no Main is defined, Excel calls the first routine in the
CODE resource.
<P>
Once the routine is written, it must be defined as a CODE resource.
The file type is generally XLLB, and the creator may be XCEL, but
these are not required. The type must be CODE, and the ID# can be any
unique ID within that file. You will also assign a name to the
resource. The resource name tells Excel which CODE resource to use, as
any one file can have multiple CODE resources attached to it.
<P>
The CODE resource is normally then compiled and saved to a file, but
it can be attached to a document or application using utilities such
as ResEdit.
<P>
