Small Business Financial Manager must be installed on your computer.

<OL><P><LI>Turn on your computer and start Microsoft Windows 95.

<P><LI>Quit Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, if it is running.

<P><LI>Insert the Microsoft Small Business Financial Manager Additional Drivers
   disk in the floppy disk drive (usually drive A).

<P><LI>Use the appropriate procedure for the driver you want to install.
<P>
</OL><h3>Businessworks for MS-DOS and Windows, version 9.0:</h3>
 
In Windows Explorer, copy the Aapbww.dll file from the floppy disk to the
aap folder on your computer's hard disk (usually the C:\Msoffice\Excel\Aap
folder).
<P>
<P><h3>M A S 90 Evolution/2 for MS-DOS, version 1.5:</h3>
 
In Windows Explorer, copy the Aapmas90.dll file from the floppy disk to the
aap folder on your computer's hard disk (usually the C:\Msoffice\Excel\Aap
folder).
<P>
<P><h3>Platinum Series for MS-DOS/Windows, version 4.1:</h3>
 
In Windows Explorer, copy the Aapplat.dll file from the floppy disk to the
aap folder on your computer's hard disk (usually the C:\Msoffice\Excel\Aap
folder).
<P>
<P><h3>Quickbooks for Windows version 3.1:</h3>
 
a. In Windows Explorer, copy the Aapqbw.dll and Qbdrivhk.dll files from
<PRE>   the floppy disk to the aap folder on your computer's hard disk
   (usually the C:\Msoffice\Excel\Aap folder).

</PRE></OL>b. In Windows Explorer, copy the Msaap.dll file to the \Windows\System
<PRE>   folder (usually the C:\Windows\System folder).

   Note: You will replace the existing Msaap.dll file with the file from
   the floppy disk.

</PRE><h2>ISSUES YOU MAY ENCOUNTER WHEN YOU IMPORT DATA</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Businessworks for MS-DOS and Windows, version 9.0:</h3>
 
If you perform a prior period adjustment into a closed period for which you
are no longer saving detailed transactions, you will need to re-import your
accounting data instead of updating your accounting data.
<P>
<P><h3>Quickbooks for Windows, version 3.1:</h3>
 
A. You must have Quickbooks installed on your computer, and the company
<PRE>   .QBW file to import must be in the same folder as the Quickbooks program
   files.

</PRE>B. While importing data, Financial Manager will need to open Quickbooks and
<PRE>   perform certain actions in Quickbooks. You should not touch you're
   keyboard or computer during this time when Quickbooks is open.

</PRE>C. In a What-If Scenario profitability analysis, the detail information for
<PRE>   any sales items entered into QuickBooks without a product code are
   placed into the N/A item in Financial Manager. In QuickBooks, the sales
   reports by customer only include those items with a product code.
   Therefore, the total sales value in the QuickBooks sales report by
   customer will not match the total sales value in the Financial Manager
   profitability analysis worksheet.

</PRE>D. In QuickBooks, the summary sales by item report includes sales tax
<PRE>   information. In Financial Manager, the profitability analysis worksheet
   does not include sales tax information. Therefore, the total sales
   revenue value in the QuickBooks summary sales by item report will not
   match the total sales value in the Financial Manager profitability
   analysis worksheet.

</PRE>E. The QuickBooks summary sales by item report does not include inventory
<PRE>   adjustments, but all Financial Manager reports and analysis worksheets
   do. Therefore, if you have made inventory adjustments, the QuickBooks
   summary sales by item report will not match all of the Financial Manager
   reports and analysis worksheets. Since the QuickBooks profit and loss
   statement does include inventory adjustments, those values will match
   the Financial Manager values.

</PRE><h3>SUPPORT</h3>
 
Assistance with these drivers is provided to you through your Microsoft
Small Business Financial Manager warranty support policy. Installing these
drivers will not restart this warranty period. If your Microsoft Small
Business Financial Manager warranty support period has expired, paid phone
support as well as alternative options are available.
<P>
If your license to the Microsoft Small Business Financial Manger product
was obtained from a hardware manufacturer, then technical support for these
drivers is not available from Microsoft. Please contact your hardware
manufacturer before installing these drivers to determine your support
options.
<P>
<P><h3>LICENSE</h3>
 
These drivers, for use only with Microsoft Small Business Financial Manager
for Microsoft Excel, are considered to be part of Microsoft Small Business
Financial Manager for Microsoft Excel. Therefore, their use is subject to
the same terms and conditions governing the use of Microsoft Small Business
Financial Manager software.
