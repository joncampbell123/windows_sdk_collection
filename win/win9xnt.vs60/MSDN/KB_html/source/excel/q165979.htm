The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you view a document in print preview or you print the document, some or
all cells may appear or print with borders. This behavior occurs even if no
border formatting is applied to the cell.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may occur when all of the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>The workbook is being shared.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -and-
</PRE>
<LI>The "Highlight changes on screen" check box is selected in the
   Highlight Changes dialog box.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -and-
</PRE>
<LI>You modify the workbook without saving it.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1: Clear the "Highlight Changes on Screen" Check Box</h3>
 
<P>
To prevent borders from appearing around cells when the workbook is shared
and contains unsaved changes, clear the "Highlight changes on screen" check
box. To do this, use the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, point to Track Changes, and then click Highlight
   Changes.

<P><LI>In the Highlight Changes dialog box, clear the "Highlight changes on
   screen" check box.

<P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
</OL>By clearing the "Highlight changes on screen" check box, the changed cells
are not highlighted (marked) on the worksheet, and the changed cells do not
appear with borders in print preview or in the printed document. If you
want changed cells to be marked on the worksheet, borders appear in print
preview or in the printed document; you cannot set these two options
independently.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 2: Use "Since I last saved"</h3>
 
<P>
If you click "Since I last saved" in the When list (in the Highlight
Changes dialog box), and then save the workbook, all modifications are
saved. After you save the file, the cells that were marked as changed cells
do not appear with a border. To use this method, use the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, point to Track Changes, and then click Highlight
   Changes.

<P><LI>In the When list, click "Since I last saved."

<P><LI>Click OK.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Save.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: If you point to Track Changes on the Tools menu, and then click
"Accept or Reject Changes," you are prompted to save the workbook before
you can accept or reject the changes. In any event, after you save the
workbook, the changed cells do not appear with a border.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design of Microsoft Excel.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you select the "Highlight changes on screen" check box, any cells that
you change are marked on the worksheet with a colored border, and a small
triangle appears in the upper-left corner of the cell. If you move the
pointer over this triangle, a comment box appears with information about
the latest modification to the cell. Also, if you manually add a comment to
the cell, the text of the comment and the text of the changes message are
combined to appear when you move the pointer over the triangle in either
the upper-left or upper-right corner of the cell.
