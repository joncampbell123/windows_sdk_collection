The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, version 4.0, 4.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you exit one of the Introducing Microsoft Excel or Learning Microsoft
Excel tutorials, your previous workspace settings are restored. However,
the placement of your toolbars may be different when these settings are
restored: toolbars that were placed on separate lines in the same docking
area will be placed on the same line if one is small enough fit into the
other's unused dock space. If you exit and restart Microsoft Excel, this
change will be written to the toolbar description file, EXCEL.XLB.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, either undock your smaller toolbars before you
run the tutorial, or rename EXCEL.XLB before you exit Microsoft Excel.
<P>
To rename EXCEL.XLB:

<OL><P><LI>Before you exit Microsoft Excel, switch to File Manager and rename
   the EXCEL.XLB file (this file should be located in the Windows
   directory). Rename the file with a filename such as MYTOOL.XLB.

<P><LI>Switch to Microsoft Excel.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Exit.

<P><LI>In File Manager, rename MYTOOL.XLB back to EXCEL.XLB and restart
   Microsoft Excel.
<P>
</OL>The toolbars will appear as they did before you ran the tutorial in
Microsoft Excel.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the versions of Microsoft
Excel listed above. This problem was corrected in version 5.0 of Microsoft
Excel for Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When Microsoft Excel starts the tutorial, your current workspace
settings are saved and replaced with default workspace settings. When
you exit the tutorial, your previous workspace settings are restored.
Your toolbar placement, however, may not be restored correctly.
