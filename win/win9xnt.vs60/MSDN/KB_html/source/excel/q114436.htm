The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0c
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows NT, version 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In the versions of Microsoft Excel listed above, there is no built-in
method in Visual Basic, Applications Edition, that will perform a Make Add-
In operation. To create an add-in from a Visual Basic subroutine, you must
use the Application.ExecuteExcel4Macro method to call the VBA.MAKE.ADDIN
macro
command.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In the versions of Microsoft Excel listed above, you can create add-in
files by choosing Make Add-In from the Tools menu in a Visual Basic module
or Microsoft Excel 4.0 macro sheet. When you do this, you are prompted to
enter a filename for the add-in that you want to create.
<P>
To create an add-in file from a Visual Basic subroutine, use the following
line of code
<P>
<PRE>   Application.ExecuteExcel4Macro "VBA.MAKE.ADDIN(""TEST.XLA"")"

</PRE>where TEST.XLA is the name of the add-in file to be created.
<P>
Note that the following line of code will NOT create an add-in file (even
though it seems like it should perform the same function):
<P>
<PRE>   ActiveWorkbook.SaveAs "TEST.XLA", xlAddIn

</PRE>This line of code will save the active workbook as a Normal workbook
with the filename TEST.XLA.
<P>
<P><h3>Visual Basic Code Example</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft provides examples of Visual Basic procedures for
illustration only, without warranty either expressed or implied,
including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability
and/or fitness for a particular purpose. This Visual Basic procedure
is provided 'as is' and Microsoft does not guarantee that it can be
used in all situations. Microsoft does not support modifications of
this procedure to suit customer requirements for a particular purpose.
Note that a line that is preceded by an apostrophe introduces a
comment in the code--comments are provided to explain what the code is
doing at a particular point in the procedure. Note also that an
underscore character (_) indicates that code continues from one line
to the next. You can type lines that contain this character as one
logical line or you can divide the lines of code and include the line
continuation character. For more information about Visual Basic for
Applications programming style, see the "Programming Style in This
Manual" section in the "Document Conventions" section of the "Visual
Basic User's Guide."
<P>
This code shows an example of the correct way create an add-in file
using a Visual Basic subroutine:
<P>
<PRE>'----------------------------------------------------------------------
Sub MakeAddIn()

   'This command makes an add-in called TEST.XLA, based on the
   'active workbook.
   Application.ExecuteExcel4Macro "VBA.MAKE.ADDIN(""TEST.XLA"")"
End Sub
