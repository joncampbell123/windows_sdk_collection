<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The following information describes how to troubleshoot problems that
you encounter while running Microsoft Excel 5.0 for Macintosh.
<P>
MICROSOFT EXCEL FOR THE POWER MACINTOSH
 
<P>
If you are having problems running Microsoft Excel 5.0 for the Power
Macintosh and you were able to run the Microsoft Excel Setup program
without error, use one of the following methods to correct the problems:

<OL><P><LI>Turn on Virtual Memory.
<P>
   For additional information, please see the following articles in the
   Microsoft Knowledge Base:

      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../office/q120257.htm">Q120257</A></B>
      TITLE     : Error Messages That Appear When Starting Excel on
                  PowerMac

   Note that you can also use Connectix RAM Doubler version 1.5 or later as
   a substitute for Virtual Memory. Make sure that your computer has at
   least 20 MB total memory if you are using Virtual Memory, or Connectix
   RAM Doubler; 17 MB WITHOUT Virtual Memory or Connectix RAM Doubler.

</PRE><P><LI>Move the PPC Registration Database, Registration Database and Embedding
   Preferences files from the Preferences folder in the System Folder to
   the desktop and Start Microsoft Excel again.

<P><LI>Restart your Macintosh while holding down the SHIFT key to disable
   extensions. Note that this also disables OLE 2 functionality (OLE1 still
   works), any Microsoft Query drivers because they use the Shared
   Library Manager, and virtual memory which is required by Microsoft
   Excel. To selectively choose extensions to enable or disable use the
   Extensions Manager located in the Control Panels folder.
<P>
   NOTE: Restarting your computer while holding down the SHIFT key does not
   always disable every extensions. A new system folder will test for
   corrupted system files as well as no extensions.

<P><LI>Use the following steps to build a clean system on the hard drive. If
   you boot off of a disk tools disk, Microsoft Excel version 5.0 will not
   run.
<P>
   System Version 7.1.2
   --------------------
<P>
   Floppy Disks:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Insert the "Disk Tools" disk that came with your Power Macintosh.
</PRE><P>
   CD-ROM:
<P>
   a. If you have System CD version 1.0:
<P>
<PRE>         Insert the CD at startup.

      If you have System CD version 2.0:

         With the CD inserted in the drive, start the machine while holding
         down the C key on the keyboard.

   b. Rename the old System Folder on the hard drive to another name such
      as "System Folder old" (without the quotation marks.)

   c. Move the Finder from the old System Folder to a different folder
      outside of the System Folder (to disable the system on the hard
      drive).

   d. Copy the System Folder from the Disk Tools disk to the hard drive (to
      the same level as the old System Folder).

   e. Check the PPC enabler in the new System Folder; if it is titled
      "Minimum PPC Enabler" or "Minimum PPC Upgrade Card Enabler", press
      and hold down the OPTION key, and drag (to copy) the "PPC Enabler" or
      "PPC Upgrade Card Enabler" from the old System Folder to the new
       System Folder. Delete the "Minimum PPC Enabler" or "Minimum PPC
      Upgrade Card Enabler" files in the new System Folder.

   f. Press and hold down the OPTION key, and drag the following files from
      the Extensions folder in the old System Folder, to the Extensions
      folder in the new System Folder:

         Microsoft Dialog Library
         Microsoft OLE Automation
         Microsoft OLE Library
         ObjectSupportLib
         Type Libraries (if you are testing module sheets or OLE1)
         Visual Basic for Applications

   g. Press and hold down the OPTION key, and drag the Memory control panel
     from the old System Folder to the new System Folder.

   h. Open the new System Folder and then close it again. A Macintosh icon
      should now appear on the new System Folder.

   i. Restart your Macintosh. If you receive an error message indicating
      that "this system should only be run from a floppy," then you didn't
      copy the full enabler (versus the minimal enabler) to the new System
      Folder.

   You should now be able to run Microsoft Excel version 5.0 for the Power
   Macintosh, as long as none of the files that you copied above are
   damaged.

</PRE></OL>For more information about booting your Macintosh from the system CD, see
the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../zmiscellaneous/q120099.htm">Q120099</A></B>
   TITLE     : Booting a Power Macintosh from the System CD

   System Version 7.5 (floppy disk or CD-ROM)
   ------------------------------------------

   For more information about performing these steps, see "Macintosh System
   7.5 Upgrade Guide," Appendix B "Performing a Clean Installation"

   a. Start the Macintosh from the hard disk drive.

   b. Start the Installer program from Disk 1 of the System 7.5 floppy
      disks.

   c. Choose the Continue button to bypass the Welcome to System 7.5 Screen

   d. In the Installer, press COMMAND+SHIFT+K, and choose "Install New
      System Folder" from the dialog box that appears.

   e. Click the Install button.

      The Installer will ask for about three of
      the seven disks, and will restart the computer when it is finished.

   f. After your computer restarts, press and hold the OPTION key, and drag
      the following files from the Extensions folder in the old System
      Folder to the Extensions folder in the new System Folder:

         Microsoft Dialog Library
         Microsoft OLE Automation
         Microsoft OLE Library
         ObjectSupportLib
         Type Libraries (if you are testing module sheets or OLE1)
         Visual Basic for Applications

   g. If you have 16 MB of RAM or less, do the following:

      (1) From the Apple menu, choose Control Panels, and then choose
          Memory.

      (2) Under Virtual Memory, select the On option. Enter 20 in the
          Virtual Memory box and close the Memory dialog box.

      (3) Restart your Macintosh.

   You should now be able to run Microsoft Excel for the Power Macintosh,
   as long as none of the files that you copied are damaged.

</PRE><P><LI>Restart your Macintosh while holding down COMMAND+OPTION until the
   Finder asks whether the Desktop should be rebuilt. Choose Yes to rebuild
   the Desktop file, and then release the COMMAND and OPTION keys.

<P><LI>To disable Connectix RAM Doubler for testing purposes, restart your
   Macintosh while holding down the TILDE key (~).
<P>
</OL><h2>MICROSOFT EXCEL FOR THE MACINTOSH</h2>
 
<P>
If you are having problems running Microsoft Excel 5.0 for the
Macintosh after you ran the Setup program with no problems, use one
of the following methods to correct the problem:

<OL><P><LI>Restart your Macintosh while holding down the SHIFT key to disable
   extensions. Note that this also disables OLE 2 functionality (OLE1 still
   works) and any Microsoft Query drivers because they use the Shared
   Library Manager.

<P><LI>Move the Registration Database and Embedding Preferences files from the
   Preferences folder in the System Folder to the desktop.

<P><LI>Rebuild the Desktop file by restarting your computer while holding down
   COMMAND+OPTION until the Finder asks whether the Desktop should be
   rebuilt. Choose Yes, and then release the COMMAND and OPTION keys.

<P><LI>To disable Connectix RAM Doubler for testing purposes, restart your
   Macintosh while holding down the TILDE key (~).

<P><LI>Clean boot by building a new System Folder on the hard drive. Note that
   you cannot run Microsoft Excel if you have booted off a disk tools disk
   because Setup copies many needed files to the Extensions folder in the
   System Folder. Do the following to clean boot:
<P>
<P><PRE>    a. Insert the Disk Tools disk, and restart your computer.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    b. Open the System Folder on the hard drive, and drag the Finder file
       to a different folder outside of the System Folder.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    c. Rename the System Folder to another name, such as "System Folder
       old" (without the quotation marks.)
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    d. Copy the System Folder from the Disk Tools disk to your hard drive.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    e. Copy the Type Libraries folder from the Extensions folder in the old
       System Folder to the Extensions folder in the new System Folder.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    f. Restart your Macintosh.
</PRE><P>
</OL>You should now be able to run Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, as
long as none of the files that you copied to the floppy disk were
damaged.
<P>
<P><h2>CAN'T INSTALL MICROSOFT EXCEL (FOR THE MACINTOSH OR THE POWER MACINTOSH)</h2>
 

<OL><P><LI>Restart your computer while holding down the SHIFT key.

<P><LI>If the Setup program is reporting a problem accessing a particular file,
   copy the cabinet file from the Setup disk to your hard drive to test if
   you can copy files from the disk. If this procedure fails, you may have
   a damaged disk, and need to order a new set of Microsoft Excel Setup
   disks.

<P><LI>If there is an existing Microsoft Excel Setup Data file, move the
   Registration Database file (located in the Preferences folder of the
   System Folder) to the desktop, and run Setup again to avoid running
   Setup in maintenance mode. If you have previously run Setup, the
   Registration Database file references the existing Microsoft Excel Setup
   Data file.
<P>
</OL>OTHER APPLICATIONS WON'T RUN AFTER INSTALLING
<P><h2>MICROSOFT EXCEL/OFFICE OR SYSTEM CRASHES WHEN STARTING COMPUTER</h2>
 
<P>
The following four extensions (along with other supporting files)
will affect other applications/extensions:
<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft OLE Extension (from Microsoft)
   Microsoft Office Manager (Office Only - from Microsoft)
   Shared Library Manager (from Apple)
   Apple Event Manager (from Apple)

</PRE></OL>To troubleshoot booting issues after installing Microsoft Excel or
Microsoft Office, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Restart your Macintosh while holding down the SHIFT key to disable all
   extensions.

<P><LI>To disable Connectix RAM Doubler if you installed this optional item,
   restart your Macintosh while holding down the TILDE key (~).

<P><LI>Remove one of the four files listed above (in the order shown above.)

<P><LI>Restart your Macintosh after removing each file to see if your Macintosh
   starts.

<P><LI>If your Macintosh starts after removing one of these files, either that
   extension is damaged (not likely right after running Setup) or another
   extension is conflicting with the one that you removed.
<P>
</OL>To troubleshoot another application that is not starting, or not performing
correctly after installing Microsoft Excel or Microsoft Office, follow
steps 2-4 above, starting the application in question until it works
properly.
<P>
If an application or extension begins working correctly AFTER removing
either the Apple Event Manager or the Shared Library Manager, but still has
problems AFTER removing the Microsoft OLE Extension and Microsoft Office
Manager, then the application is conflicting with an extension created by
Apple. You will need to get in touch with your application vendor to see if
there is an updated version of your application.
