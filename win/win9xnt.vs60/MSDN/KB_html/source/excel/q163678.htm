The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, versions 7.0, 7.0a
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0c
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Macintosh, versions 5.0, 5.0a
</UL>

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you format a cell or a range of cells in Microsoft Excel, you may
receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Too many different cell formats.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when the workbook contains more than approximately
4,000 different combinations of cell formats. A combination is defined as a
unique set of formatting elements that are applied to a cell. A combination
includes all font formatting (for example, typeface, font size, italic,
bold, underline, and so on), borders (for example, location, weight, color,
and so on), cell patterns, number formatting, alignment, and cell
protection.
<P>
NOTE: If two or more cells share exactly the same formatting, they use one
formatting combination. However, if there are any differences in formatting
between the cells, each cell uses a different combination.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To prevent this problem from occurring, simplify the formatting in the
workbook. For example, the following are suggestions for simplifying
formatting:

<UL><LI>Use a standard font.
<P>
   Using the same font for all cells reduces the number of formatting
   combinations.

<LI>If you use borders in a worksheet, use them consistently.
<P>
   Note that if you apply a border to the right side of a cell, it is not
   necessary to apply a border to the left side of the cell that is to the
   right because the borders overlap.

<LI>If you apply patterns to the cells, remove the patterns by clicking
   No Color in the Patterns tab of the Format Cells dialog box.
<P>
</UL>NOTE: After you simplify or standardize the formatting in the workbook,
save, close, and then reopen the workbook before you apply additional cell
formatting.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In most cases, the limit of approximately 4,000 different formatting
combinations for a single workbook is sufficient. This problem is likely to
occur only when the workbook contains a large number of worksheets that use
different formatting, or when a large number of cells are all formatted
differently.
