The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0c
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0
<LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel versions 5.0, 5.0c, and 7.0, when you open a workbook
that contains a drawing object, the following problems may occur:

<UL><LI>A rotated drawing object appears to lose its rotation, or the rotation
   is changed.

<LI>The gradient fill pattern for a drawing object is replaced with a solid
   color that is the wrong color.

<LI>The textured fill pattern for a drawing object disappears completely.

<LI>A drawing object with a fill pattern that consists of a picture becomes
   transparent.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior may occur when you create the drawing object or AutoShape in
Microsoft Excel 97 and then open the workbook in an earlier version of
Microsoft Excel. The drawing system in Microsoft Excel 97 includes new
features that do not translate correctly to earlier versions of Microsoft
Excel.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this behavior, use the Copy Picture command to convert
AutoShapes and drawing objects to pictures before you save the workbook in
the Microsoft Excel 5.0/95 format. To convert an object or an AutoShape
into a picture, use the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Select the object.

<P><LI>Press and hold the SHIFT key, click Copy Picture on the Edit menu, and
   then release the SHIFT key.

<P><LI>In the Copy Picture dialog box, and click OK.

<P><LI>Select a cell in the worksheet.

<P><LI>On the Edit menu, click Paste.
<P>
</OL>The original drawing object or AutoShape is converted into a picture. This
picture does not change in appearance (except for some minor color changes)
when you save the workbook in the Microsoft Excel 5.0/95 format and then
open the file in Microsoft Excel 5.0, 5.0c, or 7.0.
<P>
NOTE: When you use this method, you can no longer format the converted
object as an AutoShape or drawing object.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you open a workbook in Microsoft Excel 5.0, 5.0c or 7.0, drawing
objects that you create in Microsoft Excel 97 may appear incorrectly,
either on the screen or in the Format dialog box. The following sections
discuss the symptoms in more detail.
<P>
<P><h3>Drawing Object Is Rotated Incorrectly</h3>
 
<P>
When you create a rotated drawing object or AutoShape in Microsoft Excel
97, and you open the workbook in earlier versions of Microsoft Excel, the
rotation may be lost or changed.
<P>
<P><h3>Gradient Fill Pattern Appears Incorrectly</h3>
 
When you create a drawing object or AutoShape with a gradient fill pattern
in Microsoft Excel 97, and you open the workbook in earlier versions of
Microsoft Excel, the pattern may be replaced with a solid color that is the
wrong color. Also, the Format dialog box may display the wrong sample
color.
<P>
<P><h3>Texture Fill Pattern Disappears Completely</h3>
 
<P>
When you create a drawing object or AutoShape with a textured fill pattern
in Microsoft Excel 97, and you open the workbook in earlier versions of
Microsoft Excel, the texture is replaced by a solid color. The color of the
fill pattern becomes "average" color of the texture that is replaced.
<P>
<P><h3>Picture Fill Pattern Disappears Completely</h3>
 
<P>
When you create a drawing object or AutoShape with a picture as the fill
pattern in Microsoft Excel 97, and you open the workbook in earlier
versions of Microsoft Excel, the drawing object appears completely
transparent. You can see cells "through" the drawing object.
