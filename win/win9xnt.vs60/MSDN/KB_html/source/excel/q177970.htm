When you attempt to save a workbook in Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows, you
may receive an error message similar to the following
<P>
<PRE>   Your changes could not be saved to '&lt;Filename.xls&gt;', but were saved to
   a temporary document named '&lt;Hexadecimal&gt;'. Close the existing
   document, then open the temporary document and save it under a new
   name.

</PRE>where &lt;Filename.xls&gt; is the name of the workbook (for example, Book1.xls)
and &lt;Hexadecimal&gt; is a hexadecimal string (for example, AEF345D).
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>

   class modules, or UserForms.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>You save the workbook by clicking Save or Save As on the File menu.
