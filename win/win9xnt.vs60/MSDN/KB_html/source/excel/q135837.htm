<PRE>1. Q. Is there a limit to the number of users that can work on one
      shared list at one time?

   A. No. There is no limit to the number of users that can work on a
      shared list at one time.

2. Q. With the shared list feature, what happens if two users enter
      data into the same cell at the same time?

   A. Microsoft Excel has built-in functionality to handle such a
      conflict if it occurs. The Conflict Resolution dialog box will
      display the following information:

       - The values that were entered simultaneously
       - Where on the sheet these values are located
       - When the values were entered
       - Who entered each value

      This information allows you to choose which value you want to
      use. Microsoft Excel also displays a status log that shows each
      conflict along with its resolution.

3. Q. How are changes updated in a shared list?

   A. When you work with a shared list, changes from other users are
      not added until one of the people using the list clicks the
      Save command.

4. Q. When I use a shared list, the Note command on the Insert menu
      is available. However, when I click Note, and type a note,
      nothing happens. Why can't I insert a cell note in the
      worksheet?

   A. You cannot insert a cell note in a worksheet when you are using
      a shared workbook. For more information about this issue, order
      item number <B><A href="../excel/q131552.htm">Q131552</A></B> from the FastTips Catalog. For information
      about other features that are unavailable when you are using a
      shared list, order item number <B><A href="../excel/q130560.htm">Q130560</A></B> from the FastTips
      Catalog.
