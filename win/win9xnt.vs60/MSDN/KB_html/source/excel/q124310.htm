The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, versions 7.0, 7.0a
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 4.0, 4.0a, 5.0, 5.0c
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you open a worksheet or workbook in Microsoft Excel, formulas that
involve dividing certain combinations of numbers may display unexpected
results if the file was created on a computer that contains an Intel
Pentium processor. This behavior occurs even if you open the file on a
computer that does not contain an Intel Pentium processor, or even after
you have installed the Pentium Floating Point Unit (FPU) Patch available
from Microsoft.
<P>
Additionally, if you press the F9 key or use the calculation buttons on the
Calculation tab in the Options dialog box (version 5.0) or in the
Calculation Options dialog box (version 4.0), the formulas are not updated
with the correct results.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
If you are using Microsoft Excel on a computer that contains an Intel
Pentium processor, you may receive unexpected results when you perform
mathematical operations that involve dividing certain combinations of
numbers. This problem is caused by an error in the FPU, a part of the Intel
Pentium chip that performs elaborate calculations. Intel is aware of this
problem.
<P>
If you open a file that contains the incorrect calculations on a computer
that does not contain an Intel Pentium processor, or if you have installed
the Pentium Floating Point Unit Patch on a computer that contains an Intel
Pentium processor, the incorrect calculations are not automatically updated
on the worksheet because the formulas have not been changed.
<P>
NOTE: The FPU Patch is incorporated into Microsoft Excel 97. If you are
using Microsoft Excel 97, it is not necessary to install any type of patch
if your computer includes a floating point unit. However, if you open a
file saved on another computer, you could still encounter this problem.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To update the formulas on your worksheet, either after you have installed
the patch, or if you are using a worksheet that was created on a computer
with a Pentium processor, you must update the formulas on your worksheet.
Use either of the following methods to force the formulas to be
recalculated:
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1</h3>
 
<P>
Force the entire worksheet to be recalculated by pressing CTRL+ALT+F9.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 2</h3>
 
<P>
Recalculate a single cell or range of cells on your worksheet. To do this,
use the following steps:
<P>
NOTE: The following method is not recommended if you are using array-type
formulas. Replacing the equal sign (=) in these formulas requires you to re-
enter any array formulas as arrays.

<OL><P><LI>Select the cell (or cells) on your worksheet that you want to update.

<P><LI>On the Edit menu, click Replace. (In Microsoft Excel version 4.0, click
   Replace on the Formula menu.)

<P><LI>In the Find What box, type "=" (without the quotation marks). In the
   Replace With box, type "=" (without the quotation marks). In Microsoft
   Excel version 5.0, clear the Find Entire Cells Only check box if it is
   selected. In Microsoft Excel version 4.0, under Look At, select Part.

<P><LI>To recalculate a single cell, click Replace. To recalculate a range of
   cells, click Replace All.
