The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, the size of a workbook may increase after you save it 
if the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>You start the Visual Basic Editor while you are editing the workbook.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE>
<LI>The Visual Basic Editor is running when you open the workbook.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When you start the Visual Basic Editor, Microsoft Excel creates a Visual
Basic module sheet for each worksheet and chart sheet in the workbook. The
size of the workbook increases by approximately 1,000 to 1,500 bytes for
each worksheet and chart sheet in the workbook.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this behavior, use the following appropriate method.
<P>
<P><h3>If Your Workbook Does Not Contain Any Visual Basic Modules or UserForms</h3>
 
<P>
You can reduce the size of your file by following these steps:

<OL><P><LI>If the workbook is currently open, save the workbook, then close it.

<P><LI>Close the Visual Basic Editor if it is running.

<P><LI>Open the workbook.

<P><LI>Save the workbook.
<P>
</OL>The size of your workbook will be reduced by approximately 1,000 to 1,500
bytes for each worksheet and chart sheet that it contains.
<P>
<P><h3>If Your Workbook Contains Visual Basic Modules or UserForms</h3>
 
<P>
If you are using Visual Basic modules or UserForms in your workbook, then
you can reduce the size of your file by deleting any unused worksheets. To
delete an unused worksheet, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Activate the worksheet by clicking on its sheet tab.

<P><LI>On the Edit menu, click Delete Sheet and click OK.
<P>
</OL>When you save your workbook, the size of the workbook will be reduced by
approximately 1,000 to 1,500 bytes for each unused worksheet that you 
delete.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
