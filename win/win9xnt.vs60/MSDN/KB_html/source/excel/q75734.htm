<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Excel 3.0 and 4.0 have a Consolidation feature that allows
you to summarize large amounts of data from several worksheets. When
specifying source areas, you can use the asterisk (*) and question
mark (?) as wildcard characters in the filename. However, using these
wildcard characters in conjunction with defined names may result in
the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Reference is not valid

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
There is a potential danger in using wildcards in conjunction with
defined names because there may be certain sheets that are not
intended to be part of the consolidation that DO satisfy the wildcard
but do NOT contain the defined name specified.
<P>
<P><h3>Example</h3>
 
<P>
Suppose your source sheets have labels which all start with SHEET and
each of these sheets has a range named "Data" defined on it. In the
Reference section of the Data Consolidate dialog box, you would enter
the following as your source:
<P>
<PRE>   SHEET*.XLS!Data (in Excel for Windows)
   SHEET*!Data (in Excel for the Macintosh)

</PRE>This entry will find any worksheet in the current directory beginning
with the letters "SHEET" and look for a defined name called "Data."
The problem occurs when the current directory contains a file that
satisfies the wildcard, such as SHEET4.XLS in Excel for Windows or
SHEET4 (without the extension) in Excel for the Macintosh. Excel won't
be able to find the defined name "Data" on that sheet and returns the
error message.
<P>
<P><h3>Solution</h3>
 
<P>
If you get the error message "Reference is not valid" when you are using
wildcards AND defined names at the same time, do one of the following:

<UL><LI>Verify that the current directory does not contain any files that
   match the wildcard from which you do not want to consolidate.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Modify the wildcard so that no other files match the wildcard(s),
   except the ones from which you want to consolidate.
