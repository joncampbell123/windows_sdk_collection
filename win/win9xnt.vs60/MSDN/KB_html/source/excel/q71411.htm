The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 3.0 and 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
Summary:
<P>
Several errors may occur when you attempt to plot a Microsoft Excel
chart to a plotter. You may receive an "Out of Memory" or "Not Enough
Memory to Print" message or the printer panel may display "Memory
Overlow." Microsoft Excel sometimes displays the dialog box "Now
printing Chart1.xlc" indefinitely,  however, nothing will come out of
the plotter. Text from Microsoft Windows version 3.0 and worksheets
from Microsoft Excel may print correctly.
<P>
More Information:
<P>
The most likely reason for an unsuccessful plot is lack of Windows GDI
heap space. The GDI heap is limited to 64K of data and that can fill
up very quickly when trying to plot. The first indication that you are
running out of GDI is that titles or axes will not plot out. "Out of
Memory" errors are consistent with this behavior.
<P>
There are several ways to increase the amount of GDI before attempting
to plot the chart:

<OL><P><LI>To disable the tool bar in version 4.0, choose Toolbars from the
   Options menu and Hide each tool bar. In version 3.0, disable the
   tool bar by canceling the selection in the Tool Bar check box in
   the dialog box that appears when you choose Workspace from the
   Options menu.

<P><LI>Eliminate the background wallpaper in the Program Manager. This is
   done in the Desktop section of the Control Panel.

<P><LI>Reduce the number of icons in the Program Manager.

<P><LI>From the File menu in Microsoft Excel, choose Print and select the
   Draft check box.

<P><LI>Reduce the complexity of the chart, by removing a legend, shadow
   boxes, and so on.

<P><LI>Embed the chart on a worksheet and set a Print Area that surrounds
   the chart. From the File menu, choose Page Setup, and cancel the
   selection of Gridlines. Print the worksheet.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Print. In Microsoft Excel version 4.0,
   select the Fast but no graphics box from the Print dialog box. In
   Microsoft Excel version 3.0, select the Draft Quality box from the
   Print dialog box.
<P>
</OL>Following these steps will usually reduce the GDI demands enough to
allow a successful plot.
