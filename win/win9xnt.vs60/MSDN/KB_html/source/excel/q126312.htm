<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you save a file in Microsoft Excel, you may receive one of the
following error messages:
<P>
<PRE>   Invalid file format

   -or-

   Cannot Access f:\Data\Excel

   (where f:\Data\Excel is the drive and directory from which you opened
   the file)

   -or-

   Unable to write to disk

   -or-

   Document not saved

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Excel 5.0 creates links between the open file and two temporary
working files with .TMP extensions. When you open a file, the temporary
files are stored in either the TEMP directory or the drive from which the
file was opened. (The location of your TEMP directory is determined by the
SET TEMP statement in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.)
<P>
In Microsoft Excel version 5.0, and other Microsoft Office applications
such as Microsoft Word 6.0, workbook document files are not stored entirely
in memory. Some elements of the document are stored on the disk your file
is stored on. This is due to a new Docfile format in object linking and
embedding (OLE) version 2.0.
<P>
If the link between the open document and the temp files is broken, the
document can no longer be saved, and you may receive one of the error
messages listed above. This problem may occur, for example, if you open a
file from a network drive. If the network connection is broken while you
are making changes to the file, you may receive one or more of the error
messages listed above when you attempt to save the file.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To maintain the links between the open document and the temporary files and
to avoid this problem, do not disconnect from the network or remove the
floppy disk from which the file was opened.
<P>
If an error occurs when you save a workbook file, copy or drag the sheet(s)
to a new workbook (to create a new .TMP file in the TEMP directory) and
save the new document.
