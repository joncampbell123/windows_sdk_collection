<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
After using the Select Join or Select Outer Join command in Q+E, the
first time you use the Print or Save command may take a relatively
long time to execute. Once a Print or Save command has been executed,
the next one will execute much faster. You may also find that going to
the end of the joined file will take a relatively long time the first
time it is attempted.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This feature of Q+E is designed to make reviewing the results of the
Select Join or Select Outer Join command faster. When the command is
selected, Q+E joins only the first few windows of information, so you
can quickly see an example of the results. If you want to see more
windows of information, Q+E joins that portion. If the resulting
joined file appears correct, you will most likely want to print the
file or save it. At this point, Q+E performs the remainder of the
joining. As a result, bulk of the joining is performed when Q+E is
sure that you want to keep the results of the joining.
<P>
For more information about the Select Join and Select Outer Join
commands, see pages 15-18 of the "Q+E for Microsoft Excel User's
Guide".
