The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, when you add a value to the end of a list in a shared
workbook file that conflicts with a value added by another user in the same
cell, the Conflict Resolution dialog box may appear instead of the value
being added to the list as expected.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs if the worksheet in the shared workbook contains data
in a row below the last row of data in the list. For example, when you
enter a value in a cell at the end of a list in column A, for example cell
A4, in a shared workbook, if another user has entered a different value in
cell A4 on the same worksheet and saved the file, the Conflict Resolution
dialog box appears if there is a value on the worksheet in cell E25.
Normally, when you enter a value in a cell at the end of a list in a shared
workbook, if the value conflicts with a value entered in the same cell by
another user, an additional row is inserted in the list for the value that
you entered, and the value that the other user entered is added to the end
of the list. For example, if one user enters the value d in cell A4, at the
end of the following list
<P>
<PRE>   A1: a
   A2: b
   A3: c

</PRE>and then saves the file, when you enter the value e in cell A4 on the
same worksheet, the list appears as follows when you save the file:
<P>
<PRE>   A1: a
   A2: b
   A3: c
   A4: e
   A5: d

</PRE>The Conflict Resolution dialog box does not appear in this case. However,
if data appears on the worksheet below the last row of data in the list, a
new row is not inserted in the list because of the possibility of pushing
the data that appears below the list off of the last row on the worksheet.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To avoid receiving the Conflict Resolution dialog box in a shared file when
you add data to the end of a list, make sure that the worksheet that
contains the list does not contain any data below the last row of data in
the list.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
