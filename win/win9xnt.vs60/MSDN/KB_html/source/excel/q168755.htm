The information in this article applies to:

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you attempt to send a workbook to a Mail Recipient in any of the
versions of Microsoft Excel listed at the beginning of this article, you
may receive the following error messages:
<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft Exchange
   A dialog box is open. Close it and try again.

   -and-

   Microsoft Excel
   General mail failure. Quit Microsoft Excel, restart the mail system,
   and try again.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs if a dialog box, such as the Select Names dialog box,
is being displayed by your mail program when you attempt to send the
workbook from Microsoft Excel.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To prevent this problem from occurring, switch to your mail program and
close the dialog box by clicking OK or Cancel. Then, in Microsoft Excel 97,
on the File menu, point to Send To, and click Mail Recipient. In earlier
versions of Microsoft Excel, click Send on the File menu.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design of Microsoft mail programs such as Microsoft
Exchange and Microsoft Outlook 97.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In both Microsoft Exchange and Microsoft Outlook 97, many of the dialog
boxes used by the program are modal: that is, as long as the dialog box is
visible on the screen, the program cannot perform any other actions.
<P>
Because of this, if a dialog box is visible in your mail program, when
Microsoft Excel requests that the mail program create a new mail message,
the mail program is unable to comply. As a result, you receive the error
messages mentioned in the "Symptoms" section.
<P>
Once you close the dialog box in your mail program, if you are still unable
to send a workbook from Microsoft Excel, you may need to quit Microsoft
Excel, restart your mail program, and try again.
