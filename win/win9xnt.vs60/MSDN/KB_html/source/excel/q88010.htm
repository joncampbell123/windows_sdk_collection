1. Q. After installing Microsoft Excel version 3.0 for the Macintosh,
      all my icons are blank. How can I correct this?

   A. After the Setup program for Microsoft Excel 3.0 for the
      Macintosh is complete, restart your Macintosh, and rebuild the
      desktop to see the new Excel 3.0 icons. To rebuild the desktop
      on your Macintosh, restart the machine and press COMMAND+OPTION
      until the dialog box appears asking if you want to rebuild the
      desktop. Choose the OK button in this dialog box. All icons are
      updated on the desktop.

      For more information regarding rebuilding the desktop on your
      Macintosh, please refer to page 317 (page 311 for System 7.0) of
      the "Macintosh Reference Guide" by Apple Computer.

2. Q. What do the options offered in the Setup program mean?

   A. There are six options you can choose from during the Microsoft
      Excel version 3.0 for the Macintosh Setup program. The following
      is an overview of each option:

      Option 1. MS Excel: This option installs the minimum files
      necessary for using Microsoft Excel 3.0, including the Dialog
      Editor. If you are installing Microsoft Excel for the first
      time, you must select this option.

      Option 2. MS Excel Tutorial: This option installs a series of
      online lessons that provide an excellent way to interactively
      learn Microsoft Excel 3.0. These lessons are presented in the
      Hypercard format. Hypercard version 1.2.1 or later is required
      to use the tutorial.

      Option 3. MS Excel Help: This option installs online help for
      Microsoft Excel. Online help includes basic instructions on
      using Excel as well as reference information regarding commands,
      worksheet functions, and error messages.

      Option 4. MS Excel Solver: This option allows for linear
      programming capability and complex "what-if" analysis.

      Option 5. Data Access: This option enables you to connect to
      remote databases using Apple's Data Access Language (DAL). The
      Autostart option allows automatic log-in to a remote database.
      This feature is designed for those users who often access a DAL
      database.

      Option 6. Macro Library: This option installs a series of sample
      worksheets and add-in macros that offer ideas on how to use
      Microsoft Excel's features to create more powerful worksheets,
      macros, and models.

      For more information regarding installing Microsoft Excel,
      please refer to page 3 of the "Microsoft Excel User's Guide" for
      version 3.0.
