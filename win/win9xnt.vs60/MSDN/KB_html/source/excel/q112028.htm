<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, when you use the Range method or the Selection
property with the cells method in a Visual Basic module to return a
nonadjacent selection of cells on a worksheet, only the first cell in
the selection is returned.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in
Microsoft Excel for Windows version 5.0c.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
You can use the following sample Visual Basic procedure to return all the
cells in a selection when not all of the cells are adjacent on a worksheet:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub Apply_Italic()
   ' Declare variables
   Dim x As Object
   Dim y As Object
      ' Define y as an area in the selection
      For Each y In Selection.Areas
         ' Define x as a cell in that area
           For Each x In y
           ' Replace the following statement with the code you want to use
           ' with the cells in the selection
           x.Font.Italic = True
         Next x
       Next y
   End Sub

</PRE>Microsoft provides examples of Visual Basic procedures for illustration
only, without warranty either expressed or implied, including but not
limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and/or fitness for a
particular purpose. This Visual Basic procedure is provided 'as is' and
Microsoft does not guarantee that it can be used in all situations.
Microsoft does not support modifications of this procedure to suit customer
requirements for a particular purpose. Note that a line that is preceded by
an apostrophe introduces a comment in the code--comments are provided to
explain what the code is doing at a particular point in the procedure. Note
also that an underscore character (_) indicates that code continues from
one line to the next. You can type lines that contain this character as one
logical line or you can divide the lines of code and include the line
continuation character. For more information about Visual Basic for
Applications programming style, see the "Programming Style in This Manual"
section in the "Document Conventions" section of the "Visual Basic User's
Guide."
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Normally, you can use the Range method or the Selection property with
the Cells method to return selected cells. However, if the cells in
the selection are nonadjacent, the Range method and the Selection
property return only the first cell in the selection.
<P>
<P><h3>Visual Basic Example</h3>
 
<P>
When you run the following Visual Basic procedure, the data in each
adjacent cell in the selection appears in italic formatting:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub Apply_Italic()
   ' Define variable x
   Dim x as Object
      ' Define x as a cell in the selection
      For Each x in Selection.Cells
         ' Format the contents of each cell with Italic formatting
         x.Font.Italic=True
      Next x
   End Sub

</PRE>If the selection of cells is nonadjacent, only the data in the first
selected cell appears in italic formatting.
<P>
NOTE: To select nonadjacent cells on a worksheet, select one cell, hold
down the CTRL key, and select another cell. Repeat this procedure until you
select every cell in the selection that you want.
