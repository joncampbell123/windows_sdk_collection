<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you write a Microsoft Excel macro in R1C1 mode, relative
references to the worksheet refer to cells on the worksheet relative
to the cell containing the reference on the macro sheet. This behavior
is often encountered when using the FORMULA command function, which
places the formula text in the cell on the indicated worksheet, offset
from the cell containing the FORMULA command on the macro sheet. The
following is an example:
<P>
<PRE>   R10C1   =FORMULA("text",Worksheet1!R[3]C)

</PRE>The above statement in R10C1 places "text" in cell R13C1 of
Worksheet1, regardless of which cell is currently selected in
Worksheet1. R13C1 is three rows and no columns (R[3]C) offset from
R10C1 in the macro sheet.
<P>
This information is true for any relative references while in R1C1
notation and should be kept in mind whenever you write macros that
reference other worksheets. The only time a reference will be relative
to the worksheet is if it is an R1C1 style reference passed as text,
such as SELECT("R[3]C1") or FORMULA("=SUM(RC:R[10]C)").
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This feature is by design and is consistent with A1 style references.
When a relative reference is placed in a cell, that reference is
always relative to the cell containing the formula. In R1C1 notation,
an expression of a reference such as R[X]C is treated as an offset
from the active cell's row number by X rows. Therefore, the formula
used with this notation in a macro sheet modifies the cell in the
worksheet that is an offset from the cell containing the formula in
the macro sheet. This is true when you use a column offset, such as
RC[X], as well, where the reference is offset by X columns.
