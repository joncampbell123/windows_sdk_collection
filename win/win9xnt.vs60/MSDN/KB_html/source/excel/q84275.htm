</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you run Microsoft Excel with Microsoft Windows operating
environment, version 3.1, and choose Page Setup from the File menu,
the dialog box may fail to appear. Also Microsoft Excel may lock up
when the default printer is set to a corrupted printer driver or if
the third-party driver is incompatible with the COMMDLG.DLL file. The
same behavior may also occur when you choose Print or Print Preview.
This may also be caused by conflict with your current video driver.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you upgrade to Microsoft Windows 3.1, third-party printer drivers
are not updated. As a result, a printer driver installed with another
application under Microsoft Windows version 3.0 will be the driver in
use in Microsoft Windows 3.1. If this driver is incompatible with the
COMMDLG.DLL, Microsoft Excel may momentarily stop, and the Page Setup
dialog box may fail to appear or Microsoft Excel may lock up. The only
way to regain control is to press CTRL+ALT+DEL.
<P>
To use Page Setup and print successfully from Microsoft Excel, upgrade
the old printer driver to the Windows 3.1 version supplied by the
Windows 3.1 setup disks, the Windows Driver Library, or third-party
vendor. If you are already using the Windows 3.1 version of the
driver, it may be corrupt. Remove it from the Control Panel, delete
the associated .DRV file from the WINDOWS\SYSTEM subdirectory and
reinstall it.
<P>
If you're using an OEM or other third-party video driver, try changing
to either the standard VGA or Super VGA driver that ships with
Microsoft Windows.
<P>
For information on installing printer drivers, see pages 200-209 in
the "Microsoft Windows User's Guide."
