The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 4.0, 4.0a
<LI>Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you open a worksheet or workbook in Microsoft Excel version 4.0,
you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Cannot open a dependent document that contains references to
   different sheets with the same name.

</PRE>Choosing OK in the error message dialog box will not open the sheet.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
A formula in the current sheet (dependent document) may contain links
to external sheets that have identical filenames. When the formulas
are entered, some of them may have been entered with the complete
path for these files while others may contain only part of the
path. Microsoft Excel interprets these formulas as links to different
sheets located in separate directories.
<P>
If the link to a sheet does not specify the full path, Microsoft Excel
will search for the sheet in the same directory where the dependent
document is opened. If the dependent document is opened from the same
directory as the sheet with the full path, the link attempts to open
another sheet with the same filename in the same directory, and
Microsoft Excel is unable to distinguish one sheet from the other.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this situation, do either of the following:

<UL><LI>Open the dependent document from the directory in which the file
   was originally created and change all links to include their full
   paths.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE>
<LI>Rename the source files and change all links to include their full
   paths.
