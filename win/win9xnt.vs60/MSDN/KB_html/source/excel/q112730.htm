</PRE><h3>Introduction</h3>
 
<P>
The disk provided with this Application Note contains the MAPIVIM.DLL
file version 1.0.0.63, a replacement for the MAPIVIM.DLL file version
1.0.0.53 that is included with Microsoft Excel version 5.0 for
Windows. This updated file provides additional enhancements to the
original MAPIVIM.DLL file. It also corrects two problems that occur
when you use Lotus(R) cc:Mail(TM) and you send a mail message from
Microsoft Excel 5.0 by choosing the Send command from the File menu:

<UL><LI>The message is sent with a low priority setting. With the updated
   MAPIVIM.DLL, mail is sent with the correct priority setting.

<LI>When you choose the Address button in a New Message window, an
   hourglass pointer may appear, and your computer may hang (stop
   responding). The updated MAPIVIM.DLL corrects this problem.
<P>
</UL><h3>To replace your MAPIVIM.DLL file</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Insert the enclosed WE1009 disk in the appropriate floppy disk
   drive.

<P><LI>At the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following and press ENTER
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy &lt;drive&gt;:\mapivim.dll &lt;destination&gt;
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;drive&gt; is the floppy disk drive containing the WE1009 disk
   and &lt;destination&gt; is the Windows SYSTEM subdirectory. For example,
   if your Windows directory is C:\WINDOWS and the WE1009 disk is in
   drive A, type the following command:
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy a:\mapivim.dll c:\windows\system
</PRE><P>
   If a message is displayed asking if you want to overwrite an
   existing MAPIVIM.DLL file, type Y and press ENTER. A message will
   be displayed stating: 1 file(s) copied. This message indicates that
   your MAPIVIM.DLL file has been successfully replaced.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: If you previously added the line
<P>
<PRE>   MAPIVIMDisableABScan=1

</PRE></OL>to the [Mail] section of your WIN.INI file as a workaround for the
problem using the Address button described above, you can remove this
line after you replace your MAPIVIM.DLL file with the updated version.
This line prevents the address list from being retrieved and is no
longer needed with the updated MAPIVIM.DLL file.
