<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If a macro is allowed to continue execution by the use of a triggered
dialog box (which means the dialog box will be allowed to remain on the
screen as the macro continues), any changes made by the macro to the
document behind the custom dialog box will not be displayed. A triggered
dialog box has the same effect as ECHO(FALSE) before using a macro to make
changes to a spreadsheet. That is, the changes are actually made, but the
screen is not updated (to save time).
<P>
If you want to display updating as it takes place, you must use an
ECHO(TRUE) statement before statements in the continuing macro code that
make changes to the active document. However, this will cause the dialog
box to be erased from the screen until it is redisplayed by another
DIALOG.BOX statement.
<P>
The information above also applies to version 5.0 if you are working with
version 4.0 macros. Visual Basic for Applications code allows a spreadsheet
to update while a Dialog box (created from a Dialog sheet) is displayed.
