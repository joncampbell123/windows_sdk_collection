<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, when you open a Lotus 1-2-3 WK4 file, and you save the
file to the Microsoft Excel Workbook format, the file size may increase by
a large amount.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs if you apply formatting to an entire column or row in
a Lotus 1-2-3 WK4 file, and you then open the file in Microsoft Excel, and
save the file as a Microsoft Excel workbook. For example, if you select
column C on a worksheet in Lotus 1-2-3, apply a currency format, and then
enter values in a few of the cells in column C, the file size may increase
by a large amount when you open and save the file in Microsoft Excel.
<P>
Note that this behavior does not occur when you apply formatting to an
entire column or row in the file while it is open in Microsoft Excel.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To avoid a large increase in the size of your Lotus 1-2-3 WK4 file, do the
following before you save the file in Microsoft Excel:

<OL><P><LI>Select all of the blank cells below and to the right of the last cell on
   your worksheet that contains data.
<P>
   Note that there is no automatic way of locating the last cell on your
   worksheet that contains data.

<P><LI>From the Edit menu, choose Delete, and then choose OK.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
