<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you are editing a Visio 4 Drawing object that has been inserted into a
Microsoft Excel 97 worksheet, the object may disappear from the worksheet
when you return to Excel.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when you do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Right-click the Visio 4 Drawing object. On the shortcut menu, point to
   VISIO Object, and click Open.

<P><LI>On the File menu in Visio, click either "Exit &amp; Return To &lt;Bookname&gt;"
   or Close.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: This problem does not occur in Microsoft Word 97, Microsoft
PowerPoint 97, or earlier versions of Excel, Word, or PowerPoint.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To prevent this problem from occurring, edit the Visio 4 Drawing object in
place instead of opening it in Visio. To do this, when you right-click the
Visio 4 Drawing object and point to VISIO Object, click Edit on the
shortcut menu instead of Open. When you deactivate the drawing object, it
does not disappear.
<P>
If the problem has already occurred, it is not possible to make the drawing
object reappear. If you have not saved changes to the workbook that
contained the drawing object, you may be able to recover the drawing object
by closing the workbook without saving changes, and then reopening the
workbook.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>

want to check if a newer version of Visio is available. For more
