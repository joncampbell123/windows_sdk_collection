The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you double-click a cell that contains a formula which is linked to
another workbook, that workbook does not open as expected.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>You double-click a cell that is linked to a closed workbook.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>The link refers to a defined name.
<P>
</UL><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, use either of the following procedures.
<P>
<P><h3>Change from a Named Reference to a Cell Reference</h3>
 
<P>
For each link formula, change the link to refer to a cell reference
instead of to a defined name.
<P>
If you have several formulas that refer to the same defined name, try
using the Replace command on the Edit menu to globally search and
replace a defined name with a cell reference. For example, if you have
a link formula that refers to the defined name of Alpha and the name
Alpha refers to cell C1, then replace Alpha with $C$1 in your formula.
<P>
<P><h3>Use the Open Source Command</h3>
 
<P>
You can also open a file to which the active workbook is linked with the
Open Source command. This command is located in the Links dialog box. To
access this command, click Links on the Edit menu. The Links dialog box
shows each file to which the active workbook is linked. Select the file
that you want to open and click Open Source.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
