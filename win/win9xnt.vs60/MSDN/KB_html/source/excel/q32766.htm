The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 2.x, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, versions 1.5, 2.2, 3.0, 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Excel for OS/2, versions 2.2 and 3.0
</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, you can determine the relationship of a cell or range
of cells to other cells on your worksheet using the Info window, the Select
Special command on the Formula menu, or the Auditing option on the Tools
menu. These relationships can take the form of precedents or dependents.
Precedents are the cells referred to in the formula contained in the active
cell; dependents are the cells with formulas that refer to the active cell.
Determining these relationships can be useful when you attempt to track
down a circular reference or when you want to delete a range of cells but
don't want to alter formulas or values.
<P>
Note that external references will not be displayed as precedents or
dependents; these will be displayed only when they exist on the active
worksheet.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following describes the three methods of determining a cell's
dependencies.
<P>
To use the auditing option on the Tools menu (Microsoft Excel version 5.0)
 
<P>
Use the Auditing option on the Tools menu to trace precedents and
dependents. Microsoft Excel 5.0 will trace precedents from an external
sheet, but not dependents from another sheet.
<P>
<P><h3>To use the Info Window</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Highlight the range of cells that you would like to delete.

<P><LI>In Microsoft Excel version 3.0 and earlier: from the Windows
   menu, choose Show Info.
<P>
   In Microsoft Excel version 4.0: from the Options menu, choose
   Workspace. Enable the Info Window display option.

<P><LI>From the Info menu, choose Dependents (or Precedents).

<P><LI>Select All Levels.

<P><LI>From the Window menu, choose your worksheet name.

<P><LI>Press the TAB key to move to different cells in your selected
   range. As you move the active cell, the Info window will be
   updated to display information for the currently selected
   cell.
<P>
</OL>If any cells show dependents, then you know that the values of other
cells are dependent on the values of the cells to be deleted. If any
cells show precedents, you know that among the cells to be deleted are
formulas that refer to other cells.
<P>
<P><h3>To use the Select Special command</h3>
 
<P>
A second method of determining a cell's dependents and precedents is to use
the Select Special command. For example, to find all of the cells on your
worksheet that are referred to by other cells, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Select the entire worksheet.
<P>
   a. If you are using a mouse, click the empty box located
<P><PRE>      directly above the row number 1 and to the left of the column
      header A.
</PRE><P>
   b. If you are using a keyboard, press SHIFT+CTRL+SPACEBAR.

<P><LI>From the Formula menu, choose Select Special.

<P><LI>Select Precedents and select All Levels.

<P><LI>Choose OK or press ENTER.
<P>
</OL>This process will highlight all the cells that are referred to by other
cells on the worksheet. If the cell(s) to be deleted are included with
those highlighted, do not clear them because other cells and/or
calculations are dependent on their values.
