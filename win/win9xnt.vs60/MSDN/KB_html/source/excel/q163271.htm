   TITLE     : OFF97: How to Obtain and Install MS Office 97 SR-1


</PRE></OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, you can use the Custom Views add-in (also known as the
View Manager) to create a view in a workbook. A view can consist of the
following:

<UL><LI>Print area settings

<LI>Hidden row and column settings

<LI>Filter settings
<P>
</UL>After you create a view, you can use the Report Manager to print it. You
can print views in any order. This allows you to print information from
multiple worksheets in a workbook in a single print job.
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 97, if you attempt to show a view that is created in
Microsoft Excel 5.0 or 7.0, the print area for that view is not retained.
This is true even though the view appears in the Custom Views dialog box.
