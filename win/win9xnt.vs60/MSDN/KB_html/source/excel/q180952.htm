<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, if you enter a month name that is spelled out or
abbreviated and is followed by a space and one or two digits, the date that
appears in the cell may be different than the date you expect.
<P>
For example, when you enter the following dates, Excel displays the dates
in the following table.
<P>
<PRE>   Date You Enter   The Date That Appears
   --------------------------------------

   Dec 1            December 1, 1998
   Dec 31           December 31, 1998
   Dec 32           December 1, 1932
   December 99      December 1, 1999

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When you enter a month and a one or two digit number, Microsoft Excel
assumes that the digits represent the day of the month and that the date is
in the current year. For example, "Dec 31" translates into December 31 in
the current year.
<P>
However, if the digits exceed the number of days in the month, Microsoft
Excel converts the digits to a year and assumes that the date is on the
first of the month. For example, "Dec 32" translates into December 1, 1932.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To prevent problems from occurring when you enter dates, use the following
guidelines:

<UL><LI>When possible, enter dates more fully.
<P>
   For example, instead of typing "Dec 31," type "Dec 31, 1998," "Dec 31,
   98," "12/31/98," or "31-Dec-1998." This prevents Microsoft Excel from
   misinterpreting the dates.

<LI>Format cells that contain dates so that they display not only the month
   and day, but also the year.
<P>
   This helps you to more easily tell the difference between "Dec-31" and
   "31-Dec."

<LI>If you are importing a text file that contains dates, you can use the
   Text Import Wizard to apply proper date formatting to dates before you
   import them into Microsoft Excel.
<P>
   Note that you should also check dates after you import them to make sure
   that they appear correctly.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design of the versions of Microsoft Excel listed above.
