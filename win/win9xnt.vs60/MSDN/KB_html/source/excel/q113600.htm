The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0c
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, versions 7.0, 7.0a
<LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, when you save a workbook file on a network drive, if
you do not have both Modify and Delete rights for the directory to which
you are saving the file, one of the following occurs:

<UL><LI>When you save a new workbook file to the network drive, you receive the
   following error message
<P>
<P><PRE>      Microsoft Excel versions 5.0, 7.0
      ---------------------------------
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      Document saved as '4CCA4100'. Cannot rename to 'BOOK1.XLS'. You must
      close this document.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      Microsoft Excel 97
      ------------------
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      Your changes could not be saved to 'BOOK1.XLS', but were saved to
      '4CCA4100'. Close the existing document, then open the temporary
      document and save it under a new name.
</PRE><P>
   where 4CCA4100 is an eight-character alphanumeric string, and BOOK1.XLS
   is the name of the file being saved.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>When you save an existing workbook file to the network drive, the file
   appears to be saved with the name you entered in the Save dialog box.
   However, when you open this file again from the network, your changes do
   not appear in the file. The file is actually saved to the network drive
   with a filename that contains numbers and letters, such as 4CCA4100.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The message occurs because Microsoft Excel writes a temporary file to the
location that the file is being saved to and then renames the temporary
file to the name of the file being saved, such as BOOK1.XLS.
<P>
When you save a workbook file in Microsoft Excel, a backup copy of the
original file is created that contains the changes you made to the file.
This file is then saved over the original file. If the original file cannot
be deleted, or the backup file cannot be renamed, the backup copy (file
that contains your changes) is saved with a filename that contains a
combination of numbers and letters, such as CEDD4100. Note that the
filename does not have an extension.
<P>
You only receive an error message that contains the filename that your file
is saved to if you are saving a workbook that has not been saved before.
This is only a problem when you save a file to the Microsoft Excel Workbook
or Template format.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To avoid this behavior, do one or more of the following:

<UL><LI>Notify your network administrator that you do not have Delete rights for
   this directory on the network drive. You must have Modify and Delete
   rights in order to save a Microsoft Excel workbook file with the correct
   filename to this directory.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Save your workbook files to your local hard drive, or to a directory for
   which you do have Modify and Delete rights. You may then be able to copy
   the file to the network drive on which you do not have Modify or Delete
   rights.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>If you have an antivirus program installed either on your computer or on
   the network server, uninstall the antivirus program, and see if the
   problem still occurs. Some antivirus programs may interfere with the save
   process in Microsoft Excel.
<P>
   NOTE: In some cases, it may only be necessary to disable the antivirus
   program. If disabling the antivirus program does not work, you may need
   to actually uninstall the antivirus program.
<P>
   NOTE: You may want to check with the maker of your antivirus program to
   see if an updated version that addresses the save problem in Microsoft
   Excel.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To verify that you do not have the rights on the network to modify or
delete a file, try renaming or deleting the file on the network drive from
File Manager. If you cannot rename or delete the file from File Manager,
you are not able to save a file to this drive from Microsoft Excel.
