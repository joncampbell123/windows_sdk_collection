 Updates to Getting Results with Microsoft Excel for Windows 95

</PRE>[Setup]
<P>
Installing Microsoft Excel for Windows 95 on a machine running Windows NT
will corrupt a previous installation of Microsoft Excel 5.0 for Windows NT
(32-bit). Microsoft Excel 5.0 for Windows (16-bit) installations can be
preserved and will run fine.
<P>
You cannot run the two 32-bit versions of Microsoft Excel, version 7.0 for
Windows 95 and version 5.0 for NT both on the same installation of Windows
95 or Windows NT. These two versions are incompatible because of changes
that were made to the OLE automation object library and to the DLLs for
Visual Basic for applications. The solution is to upgrade from Microsoft
Excel version 5.0 for Windows NT to version 7.
<P>
When you install Microsoft Excel, the Setup program will not be installed
on your hard disk.
<P>
The default settings for the Typical and Custom Setup options for Microsoft
Excel for Windows 95 are the most commonly used components of Excel. To
install a complete set of all of the components, select the Custom setup
option, and then click on the SELECT ALL button in the lower right hand
corner of the dialog.
<P>
[Setup on Windows NT 3.51 (or later)]
<P>
If you are installing on Windows NT 3.51, you will need to obtain an
updated version of an NT 3.51 system file named WINSRV.DLL. This file will
be contained in Service Pack 1 for NT 3.51. The Service Pack will also
address some issues with the Help on Windows NT 3.51 and contain other
enhancements. Once the Service Pack is available, NT 3.51 users will be
able to access it the following way: This file can be obtained by
<P>
For Internet Access:
<P>
<PRE> ftp ftp.microsoft.com
 logon anonymous
 cd bussys/winnt/winnt-public/fixes/usa/nt351
 bin
 get &lt;Latest Service Pack for NT 3.51&gt;

</PRE>[Using Help on Windows NT 3.51 Without Service Pack 1]
<P>
If the Answer Wizard is launched from the Help menu when a Help topic or
Help dialog is open, Help may not function.
<P>
When you are working in a Visual Basic Module in Microsoft Excel, you may
not be able to use context sensitive Help. To use Help in a module, use the
Answer Wizard or the online Help index.
<P>
[Installing Visual Basic Help Topics]
<P>
When you do a Typical installation, and then rerun Setup to install the
Visual Basic Help, the Visual Basic Help topics don't show up in the
contents that's displayed when you click Microsoft Excel Help Topics on the
Help menu. However, the files have been installed and registered. To get
the Visual Basic Help topics to display in the table of contents, display a
Help topic using context-sensitive Help.
<P>
For example, in a Microsoft Excel Macro module, type a Visual Basic term
such as "activewindow". Put the cursor anywhere in the word and press F1.
The appropriate Help topic will display and the table of contents for
Visual Basic Help will be rebuilt. After this, the topics will display
correctly in the Help table of contents.
<P>
[Context Sensitive Help in a Visual Basic Module]
<P>
When you are working in a Visual Basic Module in Microsoft Excel, you may
not be able to use the Help On Keyword command. To display contest
sensitive Help, use the F1 key.
<P>
[Removing Earlier Microsoft Excel Version's Help Files From Path statement]
<P>
On a machine with both Microsoft Excel 95 and a previous version of
Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Excel 95 may load the previous version's Help
files. To correct this, edit the Path statement in AUTOEXEC.BAT to remove
the reference to the previous version's directory location.
<P>
[Using Disks with Distribution Media Format (DMF)]
<P>
With the exception of the Setup disk (Disk 1), your Microsoft Excel disks
use a new format called DMF (Distribution Media Format). DMF increases the
capacity of a 3.5-inch floppy disk, which reduces the number of disks
needed to install your application and speeds up installation.
<P>
Because DMF is a new format, many existing utilities such as Norton Disk
Doctor, Microsoft ScanDisk, MS-DOS DiskCopy, and Microsoft Windows Copy
Disk do not recognize DMF. You should NOT use disk utilities to examine a
DMF formatted disk, as these utilities can corrupt the DMF disk. You cannot
copy DMF formatted disks using MS-DOS DiskCopy or Microsoft Windows Copy
Disk ( If you want to copy files from the Setup disks, see "Extracting
Files from DMF Disks," later in this file.).
<P>
Windows 95, Windows 3.1 (or later), and Windows NT 3.5 (or later) support
DMF.
<P>
If there is a chance that your system has a virus, you should run a
recently updated virus detection utility such as F-prot before installing
Microsoft Excel for Windows 95. Otherwise Disk 2 and higher may become
infected with the virus.
<P>
Extracting Files from DMF Disks
<P>
If you need to copy the Microsoft Excel disks onto a network server or
other permanent storage drive, you may use the copy switch (/C) with the
EXTRACT.EXE utility on Disk 1 to copy the Microsoft Excel installation
files to the target location.
<P>
For example, after creating a directory called C:\DISKS on your hard disk
drive for the Microsoft Excel files, copy all the files on Disk 1 to that
directory. (Since Disk 1 does not use DMF, you can use the standard MS-DOS
Copy command, COPY A:\*.* C:\DISKS.) Switch to drive A and type the
following command to copy the rest of the disks to the directory C:\DISKS:
<P>
<PRE>   FOR %I IN (*.*) DO C:\DISKS\EXTRACT /C A:\%I C:\DISKS\%I

</PRE>A cabinet (.CAB) file includes many files stored as a single file. If you
need only a single file that is contained in one of the cabinet files, you
may search for it using the /D switch with EXTRACT.EXE. Once you find the
file, you can use EXTRACT.EXE again to copy the file to the desired
location. You can also type EXTRACT /? to get help on the EXTRACT command
options. Here are some examples of how to use the EXTRACT command to find
files.
<P>
To list all files in a cabinet file:
<P>
<PRE>   EXTRACT /D A:\&lt;cabinet filename&gt;

</PRE>To list all EXE files in a cabinet file:
<P>
<PRE>   EXTRACT /D A:\&lt;cabinet filename&gt; *.EXE

</PRE>Here are some examples of how to use EXTRACT to copy a single file out of a
cabinet file.
<P>
To extract ANY.EXE to the current directory:
<P>
<PRE>   EXTRACT A:\&lt;cabinet filename&gt; ANY.EXE

</PRE>To extract ANY.EXE to C:\OFFICE:
<P>
<PRE>   EXTRACT A:\&lt;cabinet filename&gt; /L C:\OFFICE ANY.EXE

</PRE>[Printing Gridlines]
<P>
In Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, gridline printing is turned off  by
default.  To turn the option on for the current document, select Page Setup
(File menu.)  On the Sheet tab, check the Gridlines box.  To have gridline
printing turned on for all new documents, open a new workbook, make the
change described above, then save the file as a template named BOOK.XLT in
the \EXCEL\XLSTART folder.
<P>
[Network Drive Connections]
<P>
To connect to a network drive from the File Open dialog in Microsoft Excel,
click on the rightmost toolbar button and select Map Network Drive.
Alternatively, you can type the UNC path to the server in the File Name
box.
<P>
[Font Differences in Custom Dialog Boxes]
<P>
Custom dialog boxes created in Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0
may not look the same when used in Microsoft Excel for Windows, version
5.0. The fonts used in the dialog boxes s will take on a bolder appearance
in Microsoft Excel for Windows, version 5.0 and the font spacing may cause
text labels to look misaligned from their original design.  If it is
necessary to run Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0 dialog boxes
in both Microsoft Excel versions 5.0 and 7.0, you should design the dialog
boxes with enough spacing between the labels and objects to compensate for
the change in font type.
<P>
[Case Sensitive Sorting]
<P>
Case Sensitive sorting works differently in Microsoft Excel for Windows 95
than it did in Microsoft Excel for Windows, version 5.0. In Excel 5.0, an
ascending sort would sort Upper case letters before lower case letters.
This has been corrected, and now Microsoft Excel 7.0 correctly sorts lower
case letters first in an ascending sort.
<P>
[Editing Data Map]
<P>
When Microsoft Excel is an embedded object in another application such as
Word and a Data Map is open, in order to insert data into the map you must
deselect Microsoft Excel, and in the application in which Microsoft Excel
is embedded, right mouse click Edit Open. Then select Microsoft Excel
again. If you are working in Binder, in order to insert data into a Data
Map, you must first click View Outside (Select menu).
<P>
[Lotus cc:Mail or Lotus Notes]
<P>
Microsoft Excel supports Vendor Independent Messaging (VIM) 1.0, which
means that you can use the Send and Add/Edit Routing Slip commands (File
menu) in Microsoft Excel to send or route Microsoft Excel documents with
mail applications such as Lotus cc:Mail that support VIM 1.0.  Lotus
cc:Mail 1.11 users may get VIM support files from Lotus. In order for
Microsoft Excel to use VIM mail applications the DOS PATH command in the
AUTOEXEC.BAT file must include the directory in which the mail
application's VIM support files are stored.  If the PATH does not include
the directory containing the VIM support files then setup will not install
VIM support for Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Excel will not function
correctly when sending mail.  The Microsoft Excel support files for VIM 1.0
are called MAPIVI32.DLL and MAPIVITK.DLL, and both are installed in the
System subdirectory of the Windows program directory.
<P>
There are known problems with Lotus Notes 3.3 TCP/IP network protocol
support which are being addressed in a future version of Lotus Notes. These
problems will prevent Microsoft Excel from sending mail through the current
versions of 16 bit Lotus Notes when Lotus Notes is using TCP/IP as its
network protocol.  Using a protocol other than TCP/IP solves the problem.
<P>
[Important Note for Delrina WinFax Pro 4.0 Users ]
<P>
WinFax Pro installed two Microsoft Excel files for use with Microsoft Excel
version 4.0 and Microsoft Excel version 5.0: MSEXCEL4.XLM and MSEXCEL5.XLS
respectively. These files are incompatible with Windows 95, Windows NT, and
Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0. If you installed Microsoft
Excel for Windows 95 over Microsoft Excel 4.0 or 5.0, Setup removed these
incompatible files from your \Excel\XLSTART directory. Removing them was
necessary in order to prevent them from causing problems with Microsoft
Excel 7.0, such as files being repeatedly opened until Microsoft Excel
would run out of memory. These files were designed to work with Windows 3.1
and not with Windows 95. Contact Delrina for information about versions of
these files that will be compatible with Microsoft Excel for Windows 95.
<P>
[Updates to Getting Results with Microsoft Office for Windows 95]
<P>
The following are changes that occurred after the book went to press. The
page numbers listed are those in the Getting Results with Microsoft Office
for Windows 95. For those who purchased Microsoft Excel as a separate
package, the page number is in parentheses.
<P>
Graphics filters licensed from Henderson Software, Inc. are not part of the
product and should not be on the copyright page.
<P>
The Btrieve driver, Btrieve Technologies, Inc., is not part of the product
and should not be on the copyright page.
<P>
Pages 27 and 29 (pages 8 and 10): The correct online location of the
Network Install Readme is in the Getting Help section of the Microsoft
Excel online Help table of contents.
<P>
Page 28 (page 9): The name of the Remove button has been changed to the
Add/Remove button. Therefore, step 5 should read, "Click the Office
application (click Microsoft Excel), and click the Add/Remove button."
<P>
Page 29 (page 10): The correct procedure for starting Microsoft Excel is
"click the Start button, click Programs, and then click Microsoft Excel."
<P>
Page 71: The name of the Blank Workbook button has been changed to New
Workbook button.
<P>
Page 79 (page 32): The first tip should read "Print part of your worksheet
- Select the area you want to print, click Print Area (File menu), and then
click Set Print Area. Then click the Print button."
<P>
Page 79 (page 32): To find out how to save your workbook as a template look
up "templates, creating" in the Microsoft Excel online index.
<P>
Page 198: To link templates to databases other than Microsoft Excel, you
must have both Data Access Objects (DAO) and Open Database Connectivity
drivers (ODBC) installed. If you need to install the Template Wizard, DAO,
or an ODBC driver, rerun Setup. (This is correct in Getting Results with
Microsoft Excel for Windows 95.)
<P>
Page 200 (page 69): The Btrieve driver is not part of the product.
<P>
Page 209 (page 38): The instructions for rotating text or data to fit into
a cell should read, "Select the cell, click Cells (Format menu), and select
orientation options on the Alignment tab."
<P>
Page 247 (page 106): The legend on the map should have an explanation that
says "Double-click the legend to customize it."

look up "Where can I obtain more maps?" in the Data Map online Help table
of contents.
<P>
Page 249 (page 108) The Zoom In and Zoom Out buttons are located on the
Data Map toolbar.
<P>
To activate your map, double-click it. The map will be surrounded by a
thick border when it is activated.
<P>
Page 250 (page 109): The opening paragraph should read, "When you first
create a map, the Data Map Control dialog box appears, and your map is
activated. Each column of data in the selection appears as a button in the
Data Map Control dialog box. The buttons in the lower-left corner of the
dialog box represent available forms."
<P>
Page 251 (page 110): Your map must be activated to see the Data Map
toolbar. The default legend for maps is the compact rather than the full
format depicted in art.
<P>
To change the default text and appearance of the legend, clear the Use
Compact Format check box in the Edit Legend dialog box. This enables you to
change the legend title text and individual legend entries.
<P>
Page 252 (page 111): After you have added custom labels or symbols by
clicking the Custom Pin Map button, to return to normal selection, click
the Select Objects button.
<P>

the Data command (Insert menu) to add only new columns or external data. To
add a new row instead of a column, insert the row between existing rows.
Then use the Map Refresh button to update your map with the new data.
<P>
Page 254 (page 113): You can add a map to documents in other applications
by dragging and dropping across application windows or by using the Copy
and Paste commands (Edit menu). To insert a new map into another
application, click Object (Insert menu) in the application where you want
to insert the map, and select Microsoft Data Map from the list. The last
