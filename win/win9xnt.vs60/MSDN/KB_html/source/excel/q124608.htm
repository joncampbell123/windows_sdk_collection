<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you are switching between Microsoft Excel and other open applications by
pressing ALT+TAB, and you are using a non-standard third-party video
driver, you may receive a general protection (GP) fault or you may receive
the following error message
<P>
<PRE>   EXCEL had an 'Exceed Segment Bounds' fault at &lt;filename hexaddr&gt;

</PRE>where &lt;filename hexaddr&gt; is the video driver filename and a hexadecimal
memory address.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may occur if you switch between applications using the ALT+TAB
key commands. The error message may be caused by too much input or output
to the third party video software.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Windows does not support video drivers or video software
manufactured by vendors other than Microsoft.
<P>
To see if the problem you are experiencing is related to a third-party
driver, install either the Microsoft Windows VGA or the SVGA driver that
ships with Microsoft Windows. These video drivers are located on your
Microsoft Windows disks and can be installed by running Windows Setup.
<P>
If using one of these drivers corrects the problem, contact the third-party
driver manufacturer and ask if there is an updated version of the driver
available.
