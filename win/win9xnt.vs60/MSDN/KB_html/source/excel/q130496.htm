<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, if the Conflict Resolution dialog box appears when
you save a shared workbook, the change information in the "Your changes on
sheet '&lt;sheetname&gt;'" box may be exactly the same as the information in
the "Conflicting Changes By &lt;username&gt;" box.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Normally, when you receive the Conflict Resolution dialog box, the change
information in the "Your changes on sheet '&lt;sheetname&gt;'" box is different
from the information in the "Conflicting Changes By &lt;username&gt;" box because
your changes conflict with the changes another user made to the same
workbook. However, if you have edited information on the worksheet by
dragging cells, the Conflict Resolution dialog box appears when you save
the file even if the other user editing the file made the exact same
changes by dragging the same cells. In this case, the information in the
Conflict Resolution dialog box confirms that the changes you made are the
same as the changes the other user made.
<P>
When two actions performed in a shared workbook by two different users
are exact, one of the actions loses "silently" or without displaying the
Conflict Resolution dialog box. However, if an exact change made by
moving cells is followed by another exact change by moving cells, the
Conflict Resolution dialog box appears when the file is saved to avoid
checking a long list of actions to see if they are the same.
<P>
Note that when this behavior occurs, you can choose to accept either your
changes to the file or the other users changes to the file because either
of the changes are the same. In this case, either choice saves the file
with your changes.
