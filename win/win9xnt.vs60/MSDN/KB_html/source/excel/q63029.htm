<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, headers or footers cannot have
more than one line. However, it is possible to get the effect of a
multiple-line header by following the steps below.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Excel 3.0</h3>
 
<P>
Note: This process will give the appearance of headers, but it
requires that certain concessions be made. These include setting aside
the first rows for the header information, using print titles for
those rows, possibly turning off row and column headings when
printing, and using borders instead of gridlines.
<P>

<OL><P><LI>Insert as many blank rows at the start of the document as are
   desired in the header.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Page Setup and cancel the Print
   Gridlines option. To turn off the display of gridlines on the
   screen, choose Display from the Options menu and cancel the
   Gridlines box.

<P><LI>If you want gridlines on the spreadsheet, select the entire
   spreadsheet except for the header lines, and apply right, left,
   top, and bottom borders to the selected cells by choosing Border
   from the Format menu. This simulates the appearance of gridlines on
   the printout, but will leave the header lines without grids, as a
   real header would also be.
<P>
   Note: Borders are solid lines, whereas gridlines are dotted lines,
   so the appearance will not be exactly the same.

<P><LI>Select the header lines in the document (by clicking on the entire
   row for each line) and choose Set Print Titles from the Options
   menu. This will print the header lines on each page as if they were
   actual headers.

<P><LI>If the worksheet is more than one page wide, the titles must be
   typed or pasted into the header area for each extra page in width.
   If this is not done, pages to the right of the first page have
   print titles that are blank.

<P><LI>You can also cancel the Print Row And Column Headings option in
   the Page Setup dialog box. This will remove the row and column
   headings, which will give the header a more realistic appearance.
   However, this will remove row and column headings for the entire
   document.
