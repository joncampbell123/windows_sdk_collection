<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
A Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh version 2.2, 3.0 or 4.0 macro
sheet can be changed just by running a macro. If these changes do
not need to be saved, using SAVE.AS(,0) causes Microsoft Excel to
ignore any changes that have taken place, allowing the macro to
close without an alert.
<P>
There are two benefits of using SAVE.AS(,0) when the macro sheet
doesn't need to be saved. The first benefit is that the "Save
Changes?" message is not displayed when you close the macro sheet. The
second benefit is that you do not waste time by performing an unnecessary
save to disk, initiated either by the macro or by Yes being chosen in
response to the "Save Changes?" message.
<P>
The two forms of the SAVE.AS command are as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   =SAVE.AS(name_text,type_num,passwd_text,backup)
   =SAVE.AS?(name_text,type_num,passwd_text,backup)

</PRE>A feature in Microsoft Excel is that a "type_num" argument of 0 (zero)
can be specified to save the active document in a sort of "null" file
format--in effect, not saving it at all. However, Microsoft Excel
will act as if the document has been saved to disk.
<P>
Note that SAVE.AS(,0) will signal Microsoft Excel that the active
document has been saved. Hence, it is very important that the macros
that use SAVE.AS(,0) first activate the appropriate document. Issuing
SAVE.AS(,0) with the wrong document active could result in important
changes not being saved.
<P>
<P><h3>When to Use SAVE.AS(,0) in Macros</h3>
 
<P>
In a macro with a custom menu and a clear exit point, using
SAVE.AS(,0) is relatively straightforward. The macro that is invoked
when exiting the application can activate the macro sheet and issue
SAVE.AS(,0).
<P>
If the macro has no clear exit point, SAVE.AS(,0) can be issued from
an auto_close macro. However, with auto_close, the "Save changes?"
message appears before auto_close is invoked. If auto_close is
inappropriate, SAVE.AS(,0) can be issued in the particular instance
(or instances) where the macro is changed.
<P>
For more information on the SAVE.AS function, refer to pages 369-370
in the "Microsoft Excel Function Reference," version 4.0.  If you are
using version 3.0, see pages 204-205 in the "Microsoft Excel Function
Reference" version 3.0 manual. If you are using Microsoft Excel
version 2.2, see page 272 of the "Microsoft Excel Functions and
Macros" version 2.2 manual.
