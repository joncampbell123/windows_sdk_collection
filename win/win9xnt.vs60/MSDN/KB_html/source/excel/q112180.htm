XL5: Custom Default Chart Format Not Applied to Embedded Chart
Article ID: <B><A href="../excel/q110829.htm">Q110829</A></B>

Article ID: <B><A href="../vbapps/q108507.htm">Q108507</A></B>
<P>
In Microsoft Excel version 5.0 for Windows, you may receive a general

it is contained.
<P>
 
XL5: "Cannot Find Macro..." Using Run Method with Add-In Macro
Article ID: <B><A href="../excel/q112219.htm">Q112219</A></B>

<P>
 
XL5: Chart References to Pivot Table Not Updated Correctly
Article ID: <B><A href="../excel/q112031.htm">Q112031</A></B>
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, if you create a chart from data in a pivot table, and

Excel version 4.0 macro to return defined names on a workbook, the
function returns the #N/A error value if the active sheet in the
workbook is a chart or a module, even if the active workbook does
contain defined names.
<P>

   - PV() - only if you use the optional arguments fv and type

</PRE>you receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Cannot write record. (Cell: A1)

</PRE>This error message appears with the reference of the cell that
contains one of the functions listed above. When you open the file
you saved, the cell that contained one of the functions listed above
now contains the value of the function, but the function is gone.
<P>

Article ID: <B><A href="../urjump.htm">Q112078</A></B>
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, if you create multiple drawing objects on a worksheet
and group them, and then create an embedded chart object, the chart becomes

same name exists on the active worksheet, the value that the local name
refers to is the value you defined for the global name and the global name
is not defined on the workbook.

a global name using the Add button in the Define Name box, when a local

sheet, and you use ERROR(FALSE) to avoid displaying error messages,
the Save As or the Delete dialog box does not close when you choose
OK.

Article ID: <B><A href="../excel/q112028.htm">Q112028</A></B>
