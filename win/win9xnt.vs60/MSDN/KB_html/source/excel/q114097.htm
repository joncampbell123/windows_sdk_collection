The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 4.0, 4.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you have both Microsoft Excel version 4.0, and Microsoft Excel
version 5.0 installed on your computer, when you link information
from a worksheet in Microsoft Excel to a document in another
application, you receive an error message if you edit or update the
linked information while Microsoft Excel version 4.0 is running.
<P>
Note that the error message appears whether the information is linked
from a Microsoft Excel version 4.0 or 5.0 file.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To avoid this behavior, when you have both Microsoft Excel versions
4.0 and 5.0 installed on your system, exit Microsoft Excel version
4.0 before you update or edit the linked information.
<P>
Note that when you use this workaround to edit linked information
from a Microsoft Excel 4.0 worksheet, the worksheet containing the
linked information is opened in Microsoft Excel version 5.0.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you edit or update linked information from a Microsoft Excel
worksheet, when you have both Microsoft Excel versions 4.0 and 5.0
installed on your computer, the behavior that occurs depends on the
application you are using to link to the information (the client
application).
