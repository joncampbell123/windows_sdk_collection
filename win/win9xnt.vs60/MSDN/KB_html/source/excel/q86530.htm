<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, when you create a custom number format that contains an
even number of underscore characters after the digit placeholders followed
by another character such as a closing parenthesis, the character will
appear in the formatted number.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel versions 3.0 and later, one of the special
formatting characters used in a custom number format is the underscore
character "_" (without the quotation marks). This character acts as a
placeholder, leaving a space in the number format that is the width of
the character that follows. For example, a custom number format of
"#,##0_)" will leave a space that is exactly the width of the
parentheses at the end of the number. This formatting is useful when
displaying negative numbers in parentheses and also desiring the
digits to align with positive numbers in the same column.
<P>
Using an even number of underscores does not leave extra space in the
number format equal to the width of the last character in the format.
When Excel encounters the first underscore character, it will leave
space in the number format for the following character. Therefore, if
there are two underline characters followed by ")", the width of the
second underline character is left after the digits and the ")" will
be displayed.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To prevent the ")" from appearing in the format and add extra spaces, use
an odd number of underscore characters.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The amount of space left by the underscore character is dependent upon
the font being used. If the font is proportional such as Microsoft
SanSerif or Helvetica, the characters "W" and ")" will leave different
size spaces. If the font is non-proportional, such as Courier, the two
characters will leave the same size spaces.
