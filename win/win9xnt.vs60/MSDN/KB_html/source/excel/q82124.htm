<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Excel DDB() function returns a different answer than that
returned by a financial calculator, such as the Hewlett-Packard (HP)
17C. Both answers are technically correct. The HP answers reflect a
switch from the double-declining balance methodology to straight-line
methodology in that period where it is to your financial advantage to
do so. The DDB() function does not make this change.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The DDB() (double declining balance) function is used to calculate an
accelerated depreciation (where the depreciation is highest in the
first year and lower in later years) for an asset. Unlike the HP 17C,
the DDB() function does not take into account that it is often
desirable to switch to the straight-line depreciation method at some
point in the life of the asset. Microsoft Excel provides another
function called VDB() (variable declining balance) to provide this
functionality.
<P>
<P><h3>Example</h3>
 
<P>
The following is a depreciation schedule using DDB(), VDB() and SLN()
(straight line) for an asset which costs $10,000, has a life of 5
years and a salvage value of $500.
<P>
<PRE>      Year   DDB      VDB      SLN

       1     4000     4000     1900
       2     2400     2400     1900
       3     1440     1440     1900
       4      864      864     1900
       5    518.4      796     1900

Total      9222.4     9500     9500

</PRE>Note that the DDB() and the VDB() method diverge in the 5th year. This
is the point at which it would be to your advantage to switch to SLN()
depreciation, as more depreciation is recognized earlier. The $276.60
of the asset not depreciated by DDB() would have to be written off in
the 6th year.
