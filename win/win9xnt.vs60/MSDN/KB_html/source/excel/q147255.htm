<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Lookup Wizard is part of a series of add-on wizards that Microsoft has
made available to enhance your use of Microsoft Excel. The Lookup Wizard
helps you to write formulas that find the value at the intersection of a
column and a row in a rectangular range of cells on a worksheet.
<P>
The add-in in this article is provided "as is" and Microsoft does not
guarantee that it can be used in all situations. Although Microsoft
Technical Support engineers can help with the installation and existing
functionality of this add-in, they will not modify the add-in to provide
new functionality.
<P>
NOTE: The Lookup Wizard is included with Microsoft Excel 97 or Microsoft
Excel 98 Macintosh Edition.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Lookup Wizard creates lookup formulas that find the value at the
intersection of a column and a row. The formulas that the wizard creates
use a combination of the lookup functions that are available in Microsoft
Excel. Below is a detailed description of each step in the wizard, followed
by an example.
<P>
<P><h3>Step 1 of the Wizard</h3>
 
<P>
In this step, you need to specify the range of cells containing data that
will be used for the formula. This range must include column labels and row
labels. For the most part, this means you need to select the entire list on
the worksheet.
<P>
Like most of the Microsoft Excel add-ins, the dialog box will open with the
Range Edit box filled in. Microsoft Excel (version 5.0 and later) is
designed to determine where your list is. If the range is not filled in
correctly, you must select the correct range, either by using the mouse or
by typing it in manually.
<P>
NOTE: It is important to have column and row labels in the data range
specified. The wizard uses these labels in the following steps.
<P>
<P><h3>Step 2 of the Wizard</h3>
 
<P>
The result of the formula that this wizard creates is the intersection of a
row and a column. In this step, you need to specify the row and column
labels that correspond to the intersection that the wizard will find. There
will be a list for each the column and the row labels. Select a label from
each list.
<P>
In both lists, the first option ("No column label matches exactly" and "No
row label matches exactly") is used to create a new value. Microsoft Excel
uses the largest column or row label less than or equal to the new value.
If a new value is created for the column argument, then an existing label
must be chosen for the row argument. Likewise, if a new value is created
for the row argument, an existing label must be chosen for the column
argument. If you attempt to create a new value for both the column
and row arguments, the following message appears:
<P>
<PRE>   You must choose at least one existing value to match. Your existing
   value can be a row label or a column label. Please try again.

</PRE><h3>Step 3 of the Wizard</h3>
 
<P>
In this step, the wizard copies the formula to the worksheet. There are two
different ways that the wizard can copy the formula to the worksheet. Use
either of the following options:

<UL><LI>Copy only the lookup formula that was generated from the current
   settings. (Or, Copy just the formula to a single cell.)
<P>
   This option copies the formula to the worksheet, and it is selected by
   default.

<LI>Include current lookup parameters in the worksheet, so that they can
   easily be changed. (Or, Copy the formula and lookup parameters.)
<P>
   This option copies the formula as well as the values of the lookup
   parameters to the worksheet. If you use this option, you can change the
   values of the lookup parameters without having to modify the formula or
   to go through the Wizard again.
<P>
</UL><h3>Step 4 of the Wizard</h3>
 
<P>
Depending on which option you chose in step 3 of the wizard, the
information that is needed in this step changes. Depending on which option
you chose, do either of the following:

<UL><LI>If you chose the first option in step 3 (that is, copy only the lookup
   formula that was generated from the current settings), you need to
   provide the cell reference of where the formula is to be placed. You can
   use the mouse to select the cell reference or you can type it in.

<LI>If you chose the second option in step 3 (that is, include current
   lookup parameters in the worksheet), you need to provide the cell
   reference of where the lookup parameter values and formula are to be
   placed. You need to select only one cell reference because the wizard
   uses the cell reference specified plus the next two cells in that row.
   (The wizard uses a total of 3 cells.) You can select the cell using the
   mouse or you can type in the cell reference.
<P>
</UL><h3>Example of the Lookup Wizard</h3>
 
<P>
NOTE: Before you can use this example, you must install the add-in. Please
download the file and see the Readme.txt file for the installation
instructions. In Microsoft Excel 97 and Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh
Edition, click Add-Ins on the Tools menu and select Lookup Wizard.

TechNet compact disc and from Online Services.

</PRE><P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Lookup Wizard. (Or, click the Tools menu, point
   to Wizard, and click Lookup.)

<P><LI>In step 1 of the wizard, the range $A$1:$E$10 should be filled in. If it
   is not, type in the correct range. Click Next.

<P><LI>In step 2 of the wizard, select the Column label "Comp C" and the row
   label "8/11/95" from the lists. Click Next.

<P><LI>In dtep 3 of the wizard, select "Copy just the formula in a single
   cell." Click Next.

<P><LI>In step 4 of the wizard, the cell reference on the worksheet to copy the
   formula to is $F$1. Click the Finish button. The answer in F1 will be
   44.12, and the formula will be the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      =INDEX($A$1:$E$10,MATCH(DATEVALUE("8/11/95"),$A$1:$A$10,),
<PRE></PRE>         MATCH("Comp C",$A$1:$E$1,))
