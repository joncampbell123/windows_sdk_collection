<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When a movable custom dialog box is created in Microsoft Excel, it will
leave a copy of itself in the original location when moved if an
=ECHO(FALSE) command is included in the macro before the dialog box
is called.
<P>
NOTE: This information applies when using Excel 4.0 macros when using
Microsoft Excel 5.0
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Excel provides the ability to create custom dialog boxes that
can be moved. This is accomplished by entering a title for the dialog
box in the text column of the first line in the dialog box definition.
This creates a title bar and control menu (-) for the dialog box when it
is displayed. The dialog box may then be moved by clicking the title bar
and dragging the box or by accessing the control menu (-) and selecting
Move. The latter technique allows you to move the dialog box without a
mouse.
<P>
When an =ECHO(FALSE) command is included in the macro prior to the
=DIALOG.BOX(range) command, and the dialog box is then moved to a new
position, it will still be displayed in the original location. This is
because the =ECHO(FALSE) command suspends screen updating while the
macro is running. The macro is not completed until after the dialog
box is removed from the screen, so the original location of the dialog
box is not redrawn until this time.
<P>
The solution to this problem is to remove the =ECHO(FALSE) function
from the macro, or to insert an =ECHO(TRUE) command into the macro
prior to the =DIALOG.BOX() function.
<P>
Note that movable custom dialog boxes were not possible in Excel 2.x.
