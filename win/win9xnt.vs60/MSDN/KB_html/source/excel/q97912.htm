The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 3.0, 4.0, 4.0a, 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh versions 3.0, 4.0, 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Excel for OS/2, version 3.0
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0
<LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, when you enter a number in a cell, a built-in
number format is automatically applied based on the characteristics of
that number. The format that is used is based on the following set of 
rules:

<UL><LI>If a number contains a slash (/) or hyphen (-), it may be converted
   to a date format.

<LI>If a number contains a colon (:), or is followed by a space and the
   letter A or P, it may be converted to a time format.

<LI>If a number contains the letter E (in uppercase or lowercase
   letters, for example 10e5), it may be converted to scientific
   notation, or exponential, format.

<LI>If a number contains leading zeros, the leading zeros are dropped.
<P>
</UL><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Avoiding Automatic Number Formatting</h3>
 
<P>
If you want to enter a value such as 10e5, 1 p, or 1-2, and you do not
want the value to be converted to a built-in number format, enter the
number as text value. To enter a number as a text value, use the following 
appropriate method.
<P>
Microsoft Excel Version 5.0 and Later:
<P>
To select a range of cells, click Cells on the Format menu, click the
Number Tab, and then click the TEXT option. This allows you to enter data 
into those cells as text.
<P>
Microsoft Excel Version 4.0:
<P>
Precede your entry with an apostrophe. For example, type the following:
<P>
<PRE>   '1 p

</PRE>Microsoft Excel Versions 3.0 and Earlier:
<P>
Enclose the entry in quotation marks and precede the value with an equal 
sign. For example, type the following:
<P>
<PRE>   ="1 p"

</PRE>All Versions of Microsoft Excel:
<P>
Place a space at the beginning of the entry (or press OPTION+SPACEBAR if 
you are using Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh). 
<P>
NOTE: This method does not work if the entry resembles a number that is 
formatted in scientific notation. For example, entering " 1e9" (without the 
quotation marks) results in a scientific number.
<P>
<P><h3>Entering a Fraction (Versions 3.0 and Later)</h3>
 
<P>
To enter a fraction, such as 1/2, so that it is not converted to a
date value, type the fraction in the form XX YY/ZZ, where XX is the
integer component of the fraction, YY is the numerator, and ZZ is the
denominator. To do this, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Select the cell in which you want to enter the fraction.

<P><LI>Enter the fraction in the form XX YY/ZZ.
<P>
</OL>For example, enter 6 7/8. The cell displays the fraction, but the
formula bar displays the true decimal value of the fraction (in this case,
6.875).
<P>
To enter the fraction 1/2, type 0 1/2. If you omit the zero, the fraction
is converted to a date.
<P>
Note that after a fraction is converted to a date, its underlying value
is changed. As a result, if you import a text file or parse text,
you must precede these entries with a text character before you import
or parse your file (as described in the note under "Maintaining Number 
Formats When You Import Text Files or Use Parse").
<P>
<P><h3>Entering a Value with Leading Zeros</h3>
 
<P>
Because leading zeros are insignificant digits, Microsoft Excel omits
them when you enter a number, such as 00023, into a cell. In this case,
the General number format is applied.
<P>
To enter a value with a leading zero, use one of the methods described in 
the previous section to enter the value as text, or do the following to 
create a custom number format that contains leading zeros:

<OL><P><LI>Select the cell range you want to format.

<P><LI>In Excel 5.0 and later, click Cells on the Format menu. Click the Number 
   tab, and then click Custom in the Category box. In Excel 4.0 and
   earlier, click Number on the Format menu.

<P><LI>In the Code box, enter a zero for each digit in your number.
   For example, if your number has 5 digits, enter 5 zeros.

<P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
</OL>If you are importing a text file or parsing text, you can use this
procedure after you've imported or parsed the text. You won't need to
preformat the entries as text (as described in the following section)
as you would with numbers that are evaluated as dates, times, or scientific
notation.
<P>
<P><h3>Retaining Number Formats When You Import Text Files or Use Parse</h3>
 
<P>
When you import a text file into Microsoft Excel or use the Parse
command (located on the Data menu) to place text entries in separate
columns, automatic number formats are applied to your data if your
file contains entries similar to those mentioned above.
<P>
The Application Note "Opening and Saving Text Files" (WE0801 for
Windows or ME0802 for the Macintosh) is available from Microsoft Excel
Product Support to help you import text files without losing the
original number formats of the data. For more information about the
Windows version of this Application Note, call Microsoft Excel product
support at (425) 635-7070. For more information about the Macintosh
version of this Application Note, call (425) 635-7080.
<P>
NOTE: If you are importing a text file or parsing text, and you do not
have the Application Note "Opening and Saving Text Files" you must open the 
file in a text editor and precede these entries with the appropriate text 
character for your version of Microsoft Excel. When you open the file in 
Microsoft Excel, these entries will be treated as text.
