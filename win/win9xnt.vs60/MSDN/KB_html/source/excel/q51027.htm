<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The following document provides tips for easily updating from
Microsoft Excel version 1.50 to version 2.20.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Excel for Apple Macintosh Systems Version 2.20</h3>
 
<P>
Welcome to Microsoft Excel version 2.20. The information in this
document is intended to make your transition from Microsoft Excel
version 1.50 to version 2.20 as smooth as possible. Please read this
material before you begin using version 2.20.
<P>
<P><h3>For Instructions on Installing and Starting Microsoft Excel</h3>
 
<P>
See "Getting Started," in "Getting Started with Microsoft Excel."
<P>
Important: If you use a hard disk system, and you install Microsoft
Excel version 2.20 without removing version 1.50, start Microsoft
Excel by double-clicking the Microsoft Excel program icon, not a
Microsoft Excel document icon. If you don't do this, the Macintosh
Finder could start either version, regardless of which version you
used to create the document. This could result in a conflict between
the 1.50 and 2.20 file formats, and could lead to unexpected results.
(You can find out which version of Microsoft Excel is running by
choosing About Excel from the Apple menu.)
<P>
<P><h3>To Learn About New Features and Changes</h3>
 
<P>
See "Version 1.50 to 2.20," in "Microsoft Excel: Quick Reference
Guide," pages 1-2.
<P>
See "Microsoft Excel Version 1.50," in "Microsoft Excel Reference,"
pages 471- 479.
<P>
See "Welcome," in "Microsoft Excel: Functions and Macros," pages
vii-xi.
<P>
<P><h3>Notes on the Documentation</h3>
 
<P>
Two new manuals, "Microsoft Excel Reference" and "Getting Started with
Microsoft Excel," replace the "Microsoft Excel User's Guide" and the
"Microsoft Excel Version 1.50 Update."
<P>
The version 2.20 "Microsoft Excel Functions and Macros" manual
replaces the version 1.50 "Microsoft Excel Arrays, Functions, and
Macros" and the "Microsoft Excel Dialog Editor" manuals.
<P>
The version 2.20 "Microsoft Excel Quick Reference Guide" replaces the
version 1.50 "Microsoft Excel Quick Reference Guide."
<P>
A keyboard template has been added to the version 2.20 package.
<P>
You can continue to use your current copy of the "Microsoft Excel
Sampler."
<P>
<P><h3>If You Use Lotus 1-2-3</h3>
 
<P>
See "Lotus 1-2-3" in "Microsoft Excel Reference," pages 445-453, for a
comparison of Lotus 1-2-3 and Microsoft Excel.
<P>
<P>
IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT MOVING FROM
<P><h3>MICROSOFT EXCEL VERSION 1.50 TO VERSION 2.20</h3>
 
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Worksheet Information</h3>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Entering Formulas</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft Excel version 1.50 only recognizes formulas that begin with
an equal sign (=). However, Microsoft Excel version 2.20 recognizes
formulas that begin with any of the following characters:
<P>
<PRE>   +  -  @  =

</PRE>To enter text that begins with one of these characters, precede the
character with a space, or enclose the text in quotation marks.
<P>
<P><h3>Moving the Active Cell Through a Range</h3>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel version 1.50, pressing one of the direction keys
after you select a range will move the active cell through the range.
In version 2.20, pressing one of the direction keys will first remove
the range selection and then move the active cell. If you want to move
the active cell without removing the range selection, use the
following keys:
<P>
<PRE>   To Move the Active Cell      Press
   -----------------------      -----

   Up                           SHIFT+RETURN
   Down                         RETURN
   Right                        TAB
   Left                         SHIFT+TAB

</PRE><h3>Worksheets with Multiple Windows</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft Excel versions 1.50 and 2.20 handle window numbering
differently in worksheets with multiple windows. Version 1.50 assigns
each window a unique number, and the number stays with the window.
Version 2.20 renumbers windows each time you open a worksheet. The
windows are numbered according to how they were layered when you saved
the worksheet; if you rearrange the windows and save the worksheet,
the window numbers change when you reopen the worksheet.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Excel Version 2.20 and Your Computer's Memory</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft Excel version 2.20 needs more memory to run than version
1.50. Depending on your system's configuration, you may have to make
some adjustments to run version 2.20. For example, if you use
MultiFinder, you can increase (or decrease) the amount of memory
MultiFinder allocates to Microsoft Excel by adjusting the Application
Memory Size setting in Microsoft Excel's application window. (You open
the application window by selecting the Microsoft Excel icon in the
Finder, and choosing the Get Info command on the File menu.) See the
Apple "Macintosh MultiFinder User's Guide," pages 23-25, for details.
For more information on freeing memory for Microsoft Excel, see
"Memory Management" in "Microsoft Excel Reference," pages 466-468.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Charting Information</h3>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Adding a Label with More Than One Line</h3>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel version 1.50, you press RETURN to insert a line
break when typing text for a chart label, and you press ENTER to place
the label text on the chart. In Microsoft Excel version 2.20, press
COMMAND+RETURN to insert a line break when typing label text. To place
the label text on the chart, press either RETURN or ENTER.
<P>
<P><h3>New Line Pattern Options</h3>
 
<P>
The line pattern options in the Format Patterns dialog box have
changed. In Microsoft Excel version 1.50, you can select from among 15
patterns to apply to lines on a chart. In version 2.20, you can select
from five line types and three shading patterns, grouped under Style.
(The same shading patterns are among the version 1.50 patterns.) If
you assigned a pattern to a line in a chart created with version 1.50
and open the chart in version 2.20, the pattern will change to one of
the new Style options.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Macro Information</h3>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Memory Implications for CUT, COPY, PASTE, DELETE, and FILL Functions</h3>
 
<P>
Due to new memory management techniques in Microsoft Excel version
2.20, attempting to apply the CUT, COPY, PASTE, DELETE, or FILL
functions to a range that is too large causes the following message to
appear:
<P>
<PRE>   Selection too big, continue without undo?

</PRE>To avoid this interruption, you can turn off error checking just
before using one of these functions, and turn it back on immediately
after you use the function. The following is an example:
<P>
<PRE>   =ERROR(FALSE)
   =COPY()
   =ERROR(TRUE)

</PRE><h3>Using the OPEN and FILE.DELETE Functions</h3>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel version 1.50, the OPEN and FILE.DELETE functions
display a file selection dialog box if the file is not present in the
active directory. Microsoft Excel version 2.20 displays a message
stating that the file can't be found. If you want to simulate the
version 1.50 functionality in a version 2.20 macro, you can use the
ISERROR function. For example, you could use the following to bring up
the File Open dialog box:
<P>
<PRE>   =ERROR(FALSE)
   =IF(ISERROR(OPEN(filename)),OPEN?())
   =ERROR(TRUE)

</PRE>For more information on error checking with the ISERROR function, see
page 49 of "Microsoft Excel Functions and Macros."
<P>
<P><h3>Using the PRINT Function</h3>
 
<P>
The order of arguments in the PRINT function changed between Microsoft
Excel versions 1.0x and 1.50. For compatibility with earlier versions,
version 1.50 accepts a value for "feed" as either the fifth or ninth
argument. Microsoft Excel version 2.20 only accepts a value for "feed"
as the ninth argument. If you wrote a macro in version 1.50 that uses
the PRINT function and you want to run it in version 2.20, make sure
that the "feed" argument appears in the ninth position.
<P>
<P><h3>Incorrect Values in a Dialog Box Definition Table</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft Excel version 1.50 ignores incorrect value types in a dialog
box definition table. Microsoft Excel version 2.20 displays a message
when it finds an incorrect value type. An example of an incorrect
value type would be text in the Init/Result column of a list box entry
in a dialog box definition table. For more information, see Chapter 7,
"Custom Menus and Dialog Boxes," in "Microsoft Excel Functions and
Macros."
<P>
<P><h3>Applying Number Formats to Text in a Custom Dialog Box</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft Excel version 1.50 lets you apply number formats to any text
in a custom dialog box. version 2.20 only lets you apply number
formats to static text, number edit boxes, and integer edit boxes. To
apply number formats to text in other custom dialog boxes, such as
formula edit boxes or reference edit boxes, use the SET.VALUE and TEXT
functions. For example, SET.VALUE(ref,TEXT(date,"m/d/yy")) will enter
the number named "date" in a m/d/yy format.
<P>
<P><h3>Positioning Custom Dialog Boxes</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft Excel version 1.50 positions custom dialog boxes vertically,
relative to the top of the screen. Version 2.20 positions custom
dialog boxes vertically, relative to the bottom of the formula bar.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Printing Information</h3>
 
<P>
<P><h3>What You See on the Screen vs. What's Printed</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft Excel version 1.50 always prints at a resolution of 72 dots
per inch, which matches the resolution Microsoft Excel displays on the
screen. However, Microsoft Excel version 2.20 takes full advantage of
the printer's resolution. This results in cleaner, crisper output on
printers such as the Apple LaserWriter models. Because the resolution
on such printers is finer than the screen resolution, you may notice
slight differences in appearance between printed output and the screen
display (especially, for example, if you use spaces to align text).
However, you can use Print Preview to check how your work will appear
when printed, since it represents, as nearly as possible, the
appearance of the printed output.
<P>
<P><h3>Automatic Page Breaks</h3>
 
<P>
When you open a Microsoft Excel version 1.50 document in version 2.20,
automatic page breaks are not retained. (Page breaks you have inserted
with the Insert Page Break command are retained.) In version 2.20,
when you print the document, view it in Page Preview, or choose Page
Setup, Microsoft Excel repaginates the document.
