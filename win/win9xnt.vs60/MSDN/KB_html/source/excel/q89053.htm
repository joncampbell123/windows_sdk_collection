</PRE>Version 4.0 of Microsoft Excel for Windows includes the "Microsoft
Excel Function Reference" and two user's guides. There are several
chapters in the user's guides with information on creating Microsoft
Excel macros. The "Microsoft Excel Function Reference" contains every
Microsoft Excel function. If you want more information on creating,
using, and writing Microsoft Excel macros, Microsoft Press has
published a book titled "The Complete Guide to Microsoft Excel Macros"
by Charles Kyd and Chris Kinata. For more information on this book,
contact a local book retailer, or call Microsoft Press at (800) 677-
6366.

<PRE>1. Q. How can I move the active cell relative to its current
      location in my worksheet?

   A. To move the active cell relative to its current location, it is
      easiest to use R1C1 notation with a SELECT function.

      To move one column to the right of the current location, use the
      following function:

        =select("rc[1]")

      To move one row down from the current location, use the
      following function:

        =select("r[1]c")

      You can combine these two functions as well. To move five rows
      up and three columns to the right, use the following function:

        =select("r[-5]c[3]")

      Using the brackets tells Microsoft Excel to move relative to the
      current location. In the first two examples, when there is no
      number following the row or column, Excel remains in the same
      column or row that the active cell was in.

2. Q. How can I get version 4.0 of Microsoft Excel for Windows to
      repeat the same set of functions in my macro?

   A. Microsoft Excel 4.0 offers several ways to create loops within a
      macro. The two most common methods of creating loops are very
      similar to the methods used in programming languages such as
      Basic and Pascal.

      The first method is called a FOR-NEXT loop. It is used mainly
      when you know how many times you want to carry out the functions
      within the loop. To create a FOR-NEXT loop, enter the FOR
      formula in one cell, enter all the functions you want to carry
      out below it, and at the bottom of your column of functions,
      enter the NEXT statement. For a full explanation of the FOR-NEXT
      loop, as well as a short example, please refer to pages 154-155
      of the "Microsoft Excel Function Reference."

      A looping structure related to the FOR-NEXT loop is the FOR.CELL
      loop. This particular form of a FOR-NEXT loop is used when you
      want to carry out your series of functions on each cell in a
      range. For more information on this method, please refer to page
      155 of the "Microsoft Excel Function Reference."

      The second method is called a WHILE loop. This function is used
      mainly when you want to carry out a series of functions until
      some condition becomes true or false. To create a WHILE loop,
      enter the WHILE function in one cell, enter the steps of the
      loops below it, and finally, end the loop with a NEXT function.
      For a full explanation of the WHILE function, and a short
      example, please refer to page 455 of the "Microsoft Excel
      Function Reference."

3. Q. How can I get more information on calling my own routines
      that I have written in C or Pascal from version 4.0 of Microsoft
      Excel for Windows?

   A. Microsoft Excel 4.0 supports the calling of dynamic-link
      libraries (DLLs). These libraries can be written in C, Pascal,
      or any compiler that supports the compilation of DLLs. Packages
      that currently support this functionality include Microsoft C,
      Microsoft QuickC(R) for Windows, Borland(R) C/C++, and Borland
      Turbo-Pascal(R) for Windows.

      For information on using DLLs and developing your own DLLs,
      please refer to the Appendix in the "Microsoft Excel Function
      Reference" or call Microsoft Developer Services to obtain a copy
      of the Microsoft Excel 4.0 Software Development Kit. You can
      reach Developer Services by calling (800) 227-4679.
