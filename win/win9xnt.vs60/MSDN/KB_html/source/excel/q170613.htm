<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run the Setup program for the Microsoft Small Business Financial
Manager 97 for Microsoft Excel 97, the following error message appears:
<P>
<PRE>   Setup could not find Microsoft Excel 97 installed
   on your system. Please install Microsoft Excel 97
   before installing this application.

</PRE>When you click OK, the Setup program does not continue.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when you install Microsoft Small Business Financial
Manager 97 on a computer running Microsoft Windows NT version 4.0.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, register Microsoft Excel 97 by using one of
the following methods.
<P>
<P><h3>Reinstall Microsoft Excel</h3>
 
<P>
Depending on which program is installed, run the Setup program for
Microsoft Office 97 or Microsoft Excel 97. During this maintenance mode
installation, click Reinstall when you are prompted for the type of
installation.
<P>
<P><h3>Rebuild the Registry Settings</h3>
 
<P>
To rebuild the original Microsoft Office or Microsoft Excel registry
entries, use the following command
<P>
<PRE>   &lt;drive&gt;:\setup /y

</PRE>where &lt;drive&gt; is the drive that contains the Microsoft Office Setup disk.
This parameter forces the Setup program to use maintenance mode. When you
are prompted for the type of installation, click Reinstall. The Setup
program does not copy any files during this kind of installation. Instead,
it updates the registry based on the previous installation.
<P>
NOTE: the /y switch restores all of the Microsoft Office program defaults.
