<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, when you share a workbook, you may make a change to the
workbook that conflicts with a change that another user has made to the
workbook. The conflicting change appears in the Conflict Resolution dialog
box, and also appears on the Conflict History worksheet box when a conflict
occurs.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
A conflict occurs when you enter data in a cell that has already been used.
The Conflict Resolution dialog box appears in this case to notify you that
you made a change that conflicts with a change made by another user who has
already saved the workbook. The types of changes that cause the Conflict
Resolution dialog box to appear include changes to a value in a cell and
renaming a worksheet.
<P>
The type of change that causes the Conflict Resolution dialog box to appear
is displayed in the "Your Changes On Sheet" box and the "Conflicting
Changes By" box in the Conflict Resolution dialog box, and in the Change
column on the Conflict History worksheet. The following list contains the
different change type values that can appear in these locations.
