The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, versions 3.0 and 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
Summary:
<P>
Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh limits the number of characters that
can be typed into a cell or assigned to a string to 255 characters.
One result of this is that SQL statements which are greater than 255
characters in length must be created and saved to a file before
accessing them through a macro SQL.QUERY() statement.
<P>
More Information:
<P>
The Database Access Macro allows accessing remote databases from
within Microsoft Excel, including the submission of SQL (Structured
Query Language) queries. In order to send a SQL statement longer than
255 characters within a macro statement, the query must be saved to a
file and accessed by a special form of the SQL.QUERY() macro function.
<P>
To save a SQL query as a text file:

<OL><P><LI>From the Data menu, choose SQL Query...

<P><LI>Type out the SQL statement in the Query Editor dialog box.

<P><LI>Click the Save button and save the query out to a filename.
<P>
</OL>The syntax for the macro function SQL.QUERY for accessing a SQL query
which has been saved to a file is:
<P>
<PRE>   =SQL.QUERY(3,"Hard Disk:QueryTextFile",1)

</PRE></OL>The first argument specifies the query type; 3 indicates that a text
file will be the source for the SQL statement. The second argument
contains the folder location and filename (QueryTextFile) of the SQL
query. The '1' in the function above specifies that the information
returned after processing the query should be returned to the current
selection. This argument can be changed to whatever is appropriate. A
fourth optional argument can also be included specifying a file name
to store the returned information.
