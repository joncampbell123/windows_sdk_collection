<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 97, when you use the AutoFill feature to fill in a range
of dates, some of the dates may appear incorrectly.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This will occur if you autofill a range of dates when the interval from the
first date to the last date is greater than 32768 months, or approximately
2730 years.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
If you need to autofill a range of dates, and the interval from the first
date to the last date is greater than 2730 years, perform your AutoFill in
two or more steps, with each step filling no more than 2730 years worth of
dates.
<P>
For example, assume that you have a worksheet that contains the following
dates
<P>
<PRE>   A1: 2/2/2000
   A2: 2/2/2005

</PRE>and you want column A to be filled with dates at five year intervals, all
the way down to 2/2/5000 (February 2, 5000 AD). Because the interval from
the first date (2/2/2000) is more than 2730 years from the last date
(2/2/5000), perform your AutoFill in two steps. To do this:

<OL><P><LI>Select cells A1:A2.

<P><LI>Using the mouse, drag the fill handle located at the lower-right corner
   of cell A2 down to cell A500, and release the mouse button.
<P>
   Cell A500 shows the date 2/2/4495. This is less than 2730 years from
   the start date, 2/2/2000.

<P><LI>Select cells A499:A500.

<P><LI>Using the mouse, drag the fill handle located at the lower-right corner
   of cell A500 down to cell A601, and release the mouse button.
<P>
   Cell A601 shows the date 2/2/5000. This is less than 2730 years from
   the start date for this AutoFill, 2/2/4495.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 97, you can use dates that fall within the range January
1, 1900 to December 31, 9999. This is different from earlier versions of
Microsoft Excel, which only allow dates from January 1, 1900 to December
31, 2078.
