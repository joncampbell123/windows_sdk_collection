<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Compound interest is the amount that a dollar invested now will be worth in
a given number of periods at a given compounded interest rate per period.
Although Microsoft Excel does not include a function for determining
compound interest, you can use the following formula for this calculation:
<P>
<PRE>   =PV*(1+R)^N

</PRE>where PV is present value, R is the interest rate, and N is the number of
investment periods.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Suppose you have $1,000.00 in an investment account. The account pays 8-
percent interest and this interest is compounded annually. How much will
the investment be worth at the end of three years?
<P>
The following formula typed into a cell on a worksheet, will return the
value $1,259.71:
<P>
<PRE>     =1000*(1+.08)^3

</PRE>To create this custom function, enter the following in a new Visual Basic
module:
<P>
<PRE>   Function Yearly_Rate(PV, R, N) As Double

       Yearly_Rate = PV*(1+R)^N    'Performs computation

   End Function

</PRE>To use the custom function:

<OL><P><LI>Type the following values on a worksheet:
<P>
   A1:  1000
<PRE>   A2:   .08
   A3:     3

   where A1 contains the present value of the investment, A2 contains
   the interest rate, and A3 contains the number of investment periods.

</PRE><P><LI>In any blank cell, type the following formula:
<P>
<P><PRE>      =Yearly_Rate(A1,A2,A3)
</PRE><P>
</OL>The future value of the compounding of interest, to the original investment
of $1000.00 is $1,259.71.
