The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 2.x, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Excel for OS/2, versions 2.20, 2.21, 3.0
<LI>Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh version 2.x and 3.0
</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The calculation of the present value (PV) in Excel does not match
HP-12C calculations when the period (nper) IS NOT an integer. The
discrepancy is that HP-12C calculates the odd period differently than
Excel does. The odd period will automatically be calculated at the
beginning of the period. Odd period, by definition, is the partial
payment (for example, in nper=48.5, .5 is the odd period).
<P>
According to Hewlett-Packard (HP) technical support, the HP-12C
does the following:

<OL><P><LI>Rounds nper down (for example, 48.5 payments becomes 48).

<P><LI>Calculates PV.

<P><LI>Uses the .5 payment and calculates PV.

<P><LI>Subtracts the difference between the 2 PV values (the reason for taking
   the difference in PV instead of finding the sum is the extra odd
   period payment).
<P>
</OL>The odd period will automatically be calculated with simple interest.
<P>
You can show the discrepancy by doing the following:

<OL><P><LI>See page 51 of the "HP-12C Owner's Manual and Problem-Solving
   Guide."

<P><LI>The following arguments are given:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Rate: 1.25%;  nper: 48, 48.5, 49;  Payment: 150  Type: End
</PRE><P>
   Using the above arguments, the Excel calculation will yield the
   following PV results:
<P>
<PRE>      @ nper = 48              PV = 5389.722136
      @ nper = 48.5            PV = 5430.653043
      @ nper = 49              PV = 5471.330505

   Using the above arguments, the HP-12C calculation will yield the
   following PV results:

      @ n = 48                 PV = 5389.722136
      @ n = 48.5               PV = 5356.245601
      @ n = 49                 PV = 5471.330505

</PRE></OL>The PV calculation of HP-12C for 48.5 periods falls OUTSIDE of the
range of 48 and 49 periods because the odd period was calculated by
the method described above.
<P>

<P>
If you want to use HP-12C to calculate like Excel's calculation for
odd number of periods, contact HP Calculator Technical Support at
(503) 757-2004 and ask for the booklet "HP-12C Solutions." See section
12-8 titled "Actual Calculations" in the booklet. Reprogram the HP-12C
with the step-by-step instruction provided in the booklet. Then,
follow the steps provided on page 51 of the "HP-12C Owner's Manual and
Problem-Solving Guide."
<P>
The later versions of the HP calculators will calculate the odd period
at the END. Such calculators include the HP-19B2, HP-17B2, HP-10B,
HP-37E, HP-38E/C, and HP-18C.
