SUMMARY
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, you can create a PivotTable from multiple
consolidation ranges. These ranges can be on the same worksheet, on
separate worksheets, or even in separate workbooks. This article provides
two examples of PivotTables created from multiple consolidation ranges.
In addition, the article provides examples of how to create associated
charts that plot the data in the PivotTables.

</PRE></OL>When you create a PivotTable from multiple consolidation ranges, you use
page fields in the PivotTable to identify the ranges of data. By using
page fields, you can group ranges of related data or you can have a page
that shows a consolidation of all of the ranges. For example, with the
sample data above, you might want to create a page field for the 1992
data, and another page field for the 1993 data.
<P>
When you create the PivotTable from multiple consolidation ranges, in
step 2a of the PivotTable Wizard, you have the option of letting the
Wizard create a single page field, or you can create the page fields (up
to 4) yourself. This article gives an example for each of these two
options.
<P>
<P><h3>Let PivotTable Wizard Create a Single Page Field in the PivotTable</h3>
 
<P>
To create the PivotTable, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Make Sheet5 the active worksheet in the workbook.

<P><LI>On the Data menu, click PivotTable. In Microsoft Excel 98
   Macintosh Edition, click PivotTable Report on the Data menu.

<P><LI>In the "PivotTable Wizard--Step 1 of 4" dialog box, click Multiple
   Consolidation Ranges, and then click Next.

<P><LI>In step 2a of 4, click "Create a single page field for me," and then
   click Next.
<P>
   NOTE: In steps 5 through 8, avoid selecting the data in row 1 from each
   of the ranges of sample data, as it is not used in the PivotTable.

<P><LI>In step 2b of 4, switch to Sheet1, select cells A2:E7, and click Add.
<P>
   In step 5 you added the first range of data to the list of ranges for
   use in the PivotTable. In steps 6 through 8, you add the other ranges.

<P><LI>Switch to Sheet2, select cells A2:E6, and click Add.

<P><LI>Switch to Sheet3, select cells A2:E7 and click Add.

<P><LI>Switch to Sheet4, select cells A2:E8, click Add, and then click Next.

<P><LI>In step 3 of 4, click Next. Then, in step 4 of 4 of the wizard,
   click Finish.
<P>
</OL>You should now have a PivotTable in Sheet5 that has as many rows as there
are unique entries in the sample data (that is, one row for each sport)
and that has four columns (one column for each quarter).
<P>
You can access the page fields for this PivotTable by clicking the drop-
down arrow in the first row (specifically, in cell B1). By default, the
first page shown is a consolidation of all of the ranges of data. If you
click the drop-down in this example, you should see four additional items
in the list (Item1, Item2, Item3, and Item4). If you click Item1, the
PivotTable will simply display all of the data for the range containing
the "Eastern 1992" data (that is, the data you have on Sheet1 in this
example).
<P>
<P><h3>Create the Page Field in the PivotTable</h3>
 
<P>
To create the PivotTable, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Make Sheet6 the active worksheet in the workbook.

<P><LI>On the Data menu, click PivotTable (or PivotTable Report in Microsoft
    Excel 98 Macintosh Edition).

<P><LI>In the "PivotTable Wizard--Step 1 of 4" dialog box, click Multiple
    Consolidation Ranges, and then click Next.

<P><LI>In step 2a of 4, click "I will create the Page Fields," and then click
    Next.
<P>
   NOTE: In steps 5 through 8, avoid selecting the data in row 1 from the
   ranges of sample data, as you it is not used in the PivotTable.

<P><LI>In step 2b of 4, switch to Sheet1, select cells A2:E7, and then click
    Add.
<P>
    In step 5 you added the first range of data to the list of ranges to
    be used for the PivotTable. In steps 6 through 8, you add the other
    ranges.

<P><LI>Switch to Sheet2, select cells A2:E6, and click Add.

<P><LI>Switch to Sheet3, select cells A2:E7, and click Add.

<P><LI>Switch to Sheet4, select cells A2:E8, and click Add.

<P><LI>In the "Wizard Step 2b of 4" dialog box, click "2" (located about
    two-thirds of the way down) to set the number of page fields you
    want to create.
<P>
    The Field One and Field Two boxes become available.

<P><LI>In the All Ranges box, click the range from Sheet1. In the Field One
    box, type 1992.

<P><LI>In the All Ranges box, click the range from Sheet2. In the Field One
    box, click 1992 from the list.

<P><LI>In the All Ranges box, click the range from Sheet3. In the Field Two
    box, type 1993.

<P><LI>In the All Ranges box, click the range from Sheet4. In the Field Two
    box, click 1993 from the list. Click Next.

<P><LI>In step 3 of the wizard, click Next. In step 4 of the wizard, click
    Finish.
<P>
</OL>You should now have a PivotTable in Sheet6 that has as many rows as there
are unique entries in the sample data (that is, one row for each sport)
and four columns (one column for each quarter). But, because you created
two page fields, you should have a drop-down for Page1 and a drop-down
for Page2. If you click the drop-down for Page1 and click 1992, just the
data from Sheet1 and Sheet2 are summarized in the PivotTable. This is
because you set up the first page field for the ranges from Sheet1 and
Sheet2 and you named it 1992.
<P>
<P><h3>Creat Charts from the PivotTable Examples</h3>
 
<P>
The following steps create a new chart sheet from the PivotTable on Sheet5:

<OL><P><LI>Switch to Sheet5.

<P><LI>Click the drop-down for the Page1 page field (you should only have
   one for this PivotTable), and click All.

<P><LI>Select the range A3:F15 (the range of cells for the PivotTable on
   Sheet5 with the Page Field set to All) and press F11.
<P>
</OL>This procedure creates a column chart (assuming that you are using the
default chart format) on a new chart sheet called Chart1. If you switch
to Sheet5, click the drop-down for the Page1 page field and then click
Item 1, the data for just Sheet1 will appear in the PivotTable. If you
then switch to the Chart1 sheet, you should see that the chart has
updated to reflect just the data that is now displayed in the PivotTable
on Sheet5.
<P>
To create a new chart sheet from the PivotTable on Sheet6, do the
following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Switch to Sheet6.

<P><LI>Click the drop-down for the Page1 page field, and click All.

<P><LI>Click the drop-down for the Page2 page field, and click All.

<P><LI>Select the range A4:F16 (the range of cells for the PivotTable on
   Sheet6 with both page fields set to All) and press the F11 function
   key.
<P>
</OL>This procedure creates a column chart (assuming that you are using the
default chart format) on a new chart sheet called Chart2. If you switch
to Sheet6, click the drop-down for the Page1 page field, and then click
1992, the data for Sheet1 (Eastern 1992) and Sheet2 (Western 1992) is
consolidated in the PivotTable. If you then switch to the Chart2 sheet,
notice that the chart has updated to reflect just the data that is now
displayed in the PivotTable on Sheet6.
