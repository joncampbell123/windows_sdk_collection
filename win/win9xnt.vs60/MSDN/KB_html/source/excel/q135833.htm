<PRE>1. Q. Why is my Microsoft Excel for Windows 95 worksheet being
      printed without gridlines?

   A. In Microsoft Excel, when you create a new worksheet and print
      it, the worksheet is printed without gridlines by default.
      However, when you open a worksheet or workbook that was created
      in an earlier version of Microsoft Excel, the file behaves as
      it did in the earlier version; that is, the file is printed and
      displayed in print preview with gridlines if it was printed
      with gridlines in the earlier version of Microsoft Excel. For
      more information about this issue, please order the item number
      <B><A href="../excel/q129445.htm">Q129445</A></B> from the FastTips Catalog.

2. Q. How can I get my Microsoft Excel for Windows 95 document to be
      printed with gridlines?

   A. To print your worksheet with gridlines, use the following three
      steps:

      1. On the File menu, click Page Setup, and then click the Sheet
         tab.

      2. Under Print, select the Gridlines check box.

      3. Click OK.

      For information about other ways to automatically turn on
      gridlines, order item number <B><A href="../excel/q129445.htm">Q129445</A></B> from the FastTips Catalog.
