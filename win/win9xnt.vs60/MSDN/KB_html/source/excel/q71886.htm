<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
An image that has been created using the camera tool and then inserted
into a separate sheet (different from the source) will become
distorted when you print or preview the worksheet containing the
image. The image will, however, display correctly on the screen. The
distortion will occur after both sheets have been saved and closed,
and only the worksheet that contains the image is reopened.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Enter numbers into cells A1:B5 in a new worksheet and save the
   worksheet.

<P><LI>Select cells A1:B5.

<P><LI>From the Toolbar, choose the camera tool.

<P><LI>Open a new worksheet and click a cell, or press ENTER on your
   keyboard, to paste the camera image. Save the new worksheet.

<P><LI>Close both worksheets.

<P><LI>Open the worksheet with the camera image and choose either OK or
   Cancel to update references.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Print or Print Preview.
<P>
</OL>The camera image on the printout or preview screen will have elongated
cells and a larger point size for the chosen font.
<P>
Examples of distortion in a camera image are:

<OL><P><LI>Cells become wider or higher.

<P><LI>Text grows two or three point sizes.

<P><LI>Numbers and words may be cut off in cells.

<P><LI>Graphics, charts, and text boxes grow in proportion to the
   enlarged cells.
<P>
</OL><h3>Workaround</h3>
 
<P>
To prevent distortion of the image, open the source worksheet before
opening the worksheet with the camera image.
<P>
The reason that this distortion occurs is that when an image is taken
using the camera tool and then placed on a spreadsheet, it then
becomes a linked picture. When a linked picture is displayed on the
screen, Excel shows the picture based upon the screen display. When a
linked picture is printed, Excel will change the picture of the linked
region to match the sheet region of the original spreadsheet. (The
sheet region does change slightly in appearance when printed.)
<P>
When a linked picture or camera image is placed on a worksheet and
references a separate worksheet that has been closed and saved, Excel is
unable to print or preview the picture correctly because the information
from the source sheet is unavailable. Without this information, Excel will
print the screen image of the picture. Because screen resolution and
printer
resolution are different, the picture will be distorted. Opening the
supporting worksheet before opening the linked worksheet reestablishes the
link, making the sheet region information available, and the image will
then print and preview correctly.
