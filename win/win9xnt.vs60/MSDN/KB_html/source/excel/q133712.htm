The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, if you move a drawing object or OLE object on your
worksheet so that it overlaps any part of the range of cells that you used
to create a Microsoft Data Map object, the exclamation point button appears
in the upper-left corner of the map object.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs under the following circumstances:

<UL><LI>You create a map object using data contained in cells on your worksheet

<LI>You then move a drawing object or OLE object including the map object
   itself so that it covers a portion of the range that contains the map
   data.
<P>
</UL>For example, if you create a map from data in cells A1:B3 on your
worksheet, the exclamation point button appears on your map if you move the
map so that it overlaps any part of the range A1:B3.
<P>
This behavior occurs because when the map object is refreshed, it detects
that the range that you used to create the map has changed (because an
object has been moved within this range), even though the actual data has
not changed. The exclamation point button in the corner of the map
indicates that the map may need to be updated. Normally, this button only
appears when you change the data used in your map. However, this button
also appears if you move an object so that it covers the data used in your
map.
<P>
Note that this behavior also occurs when you move the object so that it
no longer covers the range of data used to create the map.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To remove the exclamation point button from the map object, activate the
map object, and click the exclamation point button, or click Refresh on
the Map menu.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.

button appears, click the Index tab in Data Map Help, type the following
