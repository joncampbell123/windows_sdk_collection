The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Query for Windows, version 1.0
<LI>Microsoft Query for Windows 95, version 2.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Query "User's Guide" shows how to return an SQL statement
recorded manually in Query, but if the SQL statement is longer than 255
characters that code does not work. This article shows how you can return
an SQL statement of any length recorded manually in Query.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Page 142 of the Microsoft Query User's Guide shows how to program a DDE
conversation between Query and any other application, so that you can
launch Query from the other application, perform a query manually, and
return the data, SQL connection string, and other information to the first
application. However, the example will not return an SQL statement that is
longer than 255 characters. Another problem with the example is that it
will return renamed column names, which will not work if you try to use the
SQL statement later with the SQL functions.
<P>
This procedure uses the "ODBCSQLStatement" and "ODBCSQLStatement/n" Request
Items from page 138 of the Microsoft Query 1.0 "User's Guide" to bring back
an SQL statement of any length. The "ODBCSQLStatement" and
"ODBCSQLStatement/n" request items are used instead of "QueryDefinition"
and "QueryDefinition/n" because "ODBCSQLStatement" and "ODBCSQLStatement/n"
do not return renamed column names; therefore, these statements can be used
with the SQL functions. Microsoft Query automatically renames column
headers when column totals (such as Count, Sum, and so on) are used.
<P>
Note that the SQL statement returned from Query cannot be used with DAO
(Data Access Objects), because DAO statements use a different SQL syntax
than Microsoft Query functions. DAO uses the same SQL syntax as Microsoft
Access. To manually record a DAO SQL statement, you must use Microsoft
Access.
<P>
To determine whether "ODBCSQLStatement/n" or "ODBCSQLStatement" should be
used, Query tests for the number of elements in the array created from
"ODBCSQLStatement/n". If only one element is found, then
"ODBCSQLStatement/n" cannot be used and "ODBCSQLStatement" is used instead.
If more than one element is found, then "ODBCSQLStatement" cannot be used
and "ODBCSQLStatement/n" is used instead.
<P>
Entering the SQL statement into worksheet cells will cause Wrap Text to be
turned on between SQL clauses. This procedure will return each cell's Wrap
Text status to its original state.
