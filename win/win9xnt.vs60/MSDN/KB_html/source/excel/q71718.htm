The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 2.x, 3.0, 4.0, 4.0a, 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Excel for OS/2, versions 2.2, 2.21, and 3.0

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, you cannot undo the Goto command.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Excel 5.0</h3>
 
<P>
If you use the Goto command on the Edit menu and then choose the Undo
command from the Edit menu, the command that was entered BEFORE the Goto
command is the one that is undone. The active cell will be returned to the
position it was in before you chose the Goto command.
<P>
If you choose the Goto command several times in a row, and then use the
Undo command, all of the Goto commands are ignored, and the Undo command
undoes the last command you used before you used the Goto command.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Excel 2.x, 3.0, 4.0, 4.0a</h3>
 
<P>
If you use the Formula Goto command and then execute the Edit Undo command,
the command that was entered BEFORE the Formula Goto command is the one
that is undone. The active cell will be returned to the position it was in
at the time the command before the Formula Goto command was executed.
<P>
If a series of several Formula Goto commands is executed, followed by
an Edit Undo, all of the Formula Goto commands are ignored, and the
Edit Undo undoes the last command run before the Formula Goto commands
were run.
