<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The future value of a dollar amount, commonly called the compounded value,
involves the application of compound interest to a present value amount.
The result is a future dollar amount. Three types of compounding include:
annual, intrayear, and annuity compounding. This article discusses
intrayear calculations for compound interest.
<P>
For additional information about annual compounding, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : XL: How to Calculate Compound Interest

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Calculating Future Value of Intrayear Compounded Interest</h3>
 
<P>
Intrayear compound interest is interest that is compounded more often than
once a year. Financial institutions may calculate interest on bases of
semiannual, quarterly, monthly, weekly, or even daily time periods.
<P>
Microsoft Excel includes the EFFECT function in the Analysis ToolPak
add-in. The EFFECT function returns the compounded interest rate based on
the annual interest rate and the number of compounding periods per year.
<P>
The formula to calculate intrayear compound interest using the EFFECT
worksheet function is the following:
<P>
<PRE>   =P+(P*EFFECT(EFFECT(k,m)*n,n))

</PRE>The general equation to calculate compound interest is the following:
<P>
<PRE>   =P*(1+(k/m))^(m*n)

</PRE>where the following is true:
<P>
<PRE>  P = initial principal
  k = annual interest rate paid
  m = number of times per period (typically years) the interest is
      compounded
  n = number of periods (typically years) or term of the loan

</PRE><h3>Examples</h3>
 
<P>
The examples in this section use the EFFECT function, the general equation,
and the following sample data.
<P>
<PRE> IntraYear                 Number of compounding
 compounding rate          periods per year
 -----------------------------------------------

 Semiannual                  2
 Quarterly                   4
 Monthly                    12
 Weekly                     52
 Daily                     360 or 365(actual)

</PRE>An investment of $100 pays 8.00% compounded semiannually. If the money is
left in the account for 3 years, how much will the $100 be worth?
<P>
Example Using the EFFECT Worksheet Function:
<P>
Because of semiannual compounding, you must repeat the EFFECT function
twice to calculate the semiannual compounding periods. In the following
example, the result of the nested function is multiplied by 3 in order to
spread out (annualize) the compounded rate of over the term of the
investment:
<P>
<PRE>   =100+(100*EFFECT(EFFECT(.08,2)*3,3))

</PRE>The example returns $126.53.
<P>
Example Using the General Equation:
<P>
The following example uses the general equation:
<P>
<PRE>   =100*(1+.08/2)^(2*3)

</PRE>The example returns $126.53.
<P>
<P><h3>Calculating Interest Rates for Intrayear Compounding</h3>
 
<P>
You can find the compounded interest rate given an annual interest rate and
a dollar amount.
<P>
The EFFECT worksheet function uses the following formula:
<P>
<PRE>   =EFFECT(EFFECT(k,m)*n,n)

</PRE>To use the general equation to return the compounded interest rate, use the
following equation:
<P>
<PRE>   =(1+(k/m))^(m*n)-1

</PRE><h3>Examples</h3>
 
<P>
Example Using the EFFECT Worksheet Function:
<P>
An investment of $100 pays 7.50% compounded quarterly. The money is left in
the account for 2 years For example, the following formula returns the
compounded interest rate:
<P>
<PRE>   =EFFECT(EFFECT(.075,4)*2,2)

</PRE>The example returns 16.022%.
<P>
Example Using the General Equation:
<P>
For example, the following equation returns the interest rate:
<P>
<PRE>   =(1+(.075/4))^(4*2)-1
