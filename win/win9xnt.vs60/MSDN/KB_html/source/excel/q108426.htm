help you learn Microsoft Excel: Quick Preview, which contains introductory
lessons, and Examples And Demos, which contains short lessons that focus on
a single task.

interactive lessons that introduce Microsoft Excel version 5.0. When
you first start Microsoft Excel, the Quick Preview opens
automatically. You can view it at any time by choosing the Quick
Preview command from the Help menu. When you close the Quick Preview,
you can choose to prevent it from opening each time you start
Microsoft Excel.
