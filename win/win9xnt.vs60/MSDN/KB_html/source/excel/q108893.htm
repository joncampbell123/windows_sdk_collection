<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Query, when you create a query that contains two tables that
are joined with an outer join, followed by an inner join, and the outer
join does not return any records from the second table, the resulting data
set will be empty (that is, the Data pane will not contain any records)
even if the inner join would normally return data.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When an inner join follows an outer join, the inner join attempts to
retrieve records from the result set created by the outer join. If the
result set from the outer join contains no records from the second table,
then there are no records from the second table to compare in the inner
join.
<P>
If you look at the SQL query statement that is generated by your query, you
will see that the records in the FROM clause (created by the outer join)
are the result set from which the WHERE clause (created by the inner
join) operates.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design in Microsoft Query.
