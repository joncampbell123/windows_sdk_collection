The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows NT, version 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel version 5.0 for Windows NT, Intel Edition, the list of
available files in the Open dialog box (File menu) is empty when you
attempt to open a file located on a compressed NTFS partition.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Windows NT version 3.51, you have the ability to compress NTFS
partitions of your hard disk. However, in Microsoft Excel, none of the file
names in the current directory will be displayed in the Open dialog box if
the drive is a compressed NTFS partition.
<P>
Note that this problem will only occur if the NTFS partition has been
compressed.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this problem, you need to obtain a special release of Microsoft
Excel 5.0 for Windows NT, Intel Edition. To obtain this release, contact
Microsoft Excel Product Support Services at (425) 635-7070.
<P>
This special release is available both on DMF (3.5-inch) disks and a CD-ROM
which includes Intel, Alpha, MIPS, and IBM PowerPC builds of Microsoft
Excel version 5.0 for Windows NT.
<P>
Note that version number for this release is 5.0: the only way to tell if
you have the updated version is if you have the disk or CD-ROM with the
PowerPC version of Microsoft Excel.
<P>
If you are unable to obtain this release, use the following steps to open
the files via the Open dialog box:

<OL><P><LI>On the File menu, click Open.

<P><LI>Change to the directory that contains the file that you want to open.

<P><LI>In the File Name box, type the name of the file that you want to
   open, and choose OK.
<P>
</OL>You can also open the file by doing the following:

<OL><P><LI>Start File Manager.

<P><LI>Select the file name and double-click it.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem has been corrected in
a later release of Microsoft Excel 5.0 for Windows NT, Intel Edition.
