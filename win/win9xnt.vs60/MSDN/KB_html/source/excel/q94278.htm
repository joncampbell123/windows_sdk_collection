The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, versions 1.5, 2.2, 3.0, 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you are using version 3.0 or 4.0 of Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh,
and you open a document that was created in an earlier version of Microsoft
Excel for the Macintosh, some page setup information may be lost from your 
document.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected
Microsoft Excel versions 5.0 and later.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Excel Version 3.0 Opened in Microsoft Excel Version 4.0</h3>
 
<P>
If you open a file in version 4.0 that was saved from version 3.0 with
Landscape orientation, the orientation shown in the version 4.0 Page Setup
dialog box will be Portrait but the file will still be printed in landscape
orientation.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Excel Version 2.2 Opened in Microsoft Excel Version 4.0</h3>
 
<P>
When you open a version 2.2 Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh document
in version 4.0 of Microsoft Excel, the setting for paper orientation
in the Page Setup dialog box is lost (if you selected the Landscape
option for the page orientation in version 2.2 of Microsoft Excel,
the document will revert to the Portrait option). (Portrait is the
default setting for Microsoft Excel.)
<P>
NOTE: This information is not lost if you open your document in version 3.0
of Microsoft Excel.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Excel Version 1.5 Opened in Microsoft Excel Version 3.0</h3>
 
<P>
When you open a version 1.5 Microsoft Excel document in version 3.0 of
Microsoft Excel, the following changes occur:

<UL><LI>The Paper Size option is set to US Letter.

<LI>The Reduce or Enlarge option is changed to 100-percent.

<LI>The Page Orientation option is set to Portrait.

<LI>Printer Effects options that were previously cleared are selected.

<LI>The Print Gridlines option is selected.

<LI>LaserWriter options that were selected are cleared.
<P>
</UL>Microsoft Excel retains the following Page Setup settings:

<UL><LI>Margins

<LI>Headers and footers

<LI>Print Row and Column Heading options
