<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Open EIS Pack is solution software used to design and create
Enterprise Information Systems capable of delivering presentation data
created from Microsoft desktop applications that work together.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Open EIS operates as an integrated front-end, providing
connectivity to data source applications such as Microsoft Excel, Microsoft 
Access, Microsoft Word, Microsoft Project, Microsoft PowerPoint, and 
Microsoft Visual Basic.
<P>
The EIS Builder's dialog box-based user interface guides you through the
process of creating the links to application data files to build a top
layer of presentation windows. Each area of the "home screen" may display a 
different view of summary information. EIS Pack is event driven in that
buttons allow you to "drill down" to successive layers of supporting data
views.
<P>
EIS Builder consists of pre-defined macro scripts eliminating the need to
program code. If you require more precision, you can incorporate your
Microsoft Excel macros.
<P>
Communication channels include electronic mail, Microsoft Mail, and
Microsoft LAN Manager.
<P>
Other industry standards include DDE (Dynamic Data Exchange) in Microsoft
Windows and on the Macintosh when running under system 7.0 or later. Other
standards include OLE (object linking and embedding), and APIs (Application 
Programming Interfaces) which include ODBC (open database connectivity), 
MAPI (messaging application interface), and OCE (open collaborative 
environment).
<P>

<UL><LI>MS-DOS version 3.0 or later
<LI>Microsoft Windows version 3.0 or later
<LI>A personal computer using a 386 or higher microprocessor
<LI>VGA or higher resolution monitor
<P>
</UL>To use the Microsoft Excel EIS Builder, you need:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel version 4.0

<P>
</UL>To run the sample applications you need:

<UL><LI>MS-DOS 3.0 or later
<LI>Microsoft Windows 3.0 or later
<LI>A PC with a 386 processor and at least 4 megabytes of RAM
<LI>Microsoft Excel version 4.0 for Windows
<LI>3.5-inch high-density (1.44 MB) disk drive

<P>
</UL>Open EIS Pack for the Macintosh is also available.

<LI>At least 4 megabytes of RAM
