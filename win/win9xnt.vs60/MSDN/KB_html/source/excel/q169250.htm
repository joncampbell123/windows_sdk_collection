The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use a macro to change a chart that is on a chart sheet to a
chart object on a worksheet (or vice versa), you receive one of the
following error messages:
<P>
<PRE>   Run-time error '-2147221080 (800401a8)': Automation error

   -or-

   This program has performed an illegal operation
   and will be shut down.

   If the problem persists, contact the program vendor.

</PRE>If you click Details, the following error message appears:
<P>
<PRE>   EXCEL caused an invalid page fault in
   module MSO97.DLL at 0137:307e034e.

</PRE>If you click Close, Microsoft Excel 97 closes.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when you create a Visual Basic for Applications macro
and both of the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>You use the Location method to move a chart from one sheet to second
   sheet, and then use this method to move the chart to a third location
   (or to the original location).
<P>
   For example, the following macro statement uses the Location method to
   move a chart to a chart sheet named Chart1:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ActiveChart.Location where:=xlLocationAsNewSheet, Name:="Chart1"
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    -and-
</PRE>
<LI>You use the Set statement to assign a variable to the chart object you
   want to move.
<P>
</UL><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft provides examples of Visual Basic for Applications procedures for

for a particular purpose. The Visual Basic procedures in this article are
provided 'as is' and Microsoft does not guarantee that they can be used in
all situations. While Microsoft support engineers can help explain the
functionality of a particular macro, they will not modify these examples to
provide added functionality, nor will they help you construct macros to
meet your specific needs. If you have limited programming experience, you
may want to consult one of the Microsoft Solution Providers. Solution
Providers offer a wide range of fee-based services, including creating
custom macros. For more information about Microsoft Solution Providers,

<P>
To move a chart without receiving this error message, use one of the
following methods.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1: Refer to the Chart as an Object</h3>
 
<P>
Assign an object variable to the chart object each time it is moved. You
must use this variable when you refer to the chart. For example, the
following macro creates an embedded chart on Sheet1 using data on Sheet1 in
the range A1:C4. The chart is moved to a new chart sheet and is then moved
back to Sheet1. In the following example, each time the chart object is
referenced, the variable X is set equal to the chart:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub MoveChart()

      Dim x As Chart

      ' Create an embedded chart on a chart sheet.
      Set x = Charts.Add
      x.ChartType = xlColumnClustered
      x.SetSourceData Source:=Sheets("Sheet1").Range("A1:C4")
      Set x = x.Location(where:=xlLocationAsObject, Name:="Sheet1")
      ' Move chart to new sheet and reset the chart object variable x.
      Set x = x.Location(where:=xlLocationAsNewSheet, Name:="Chart1")

      ' Move chart to back to the chart sheet.
      Set x= x.Location(where:=xlLocationAsObject, Name:="Sheet1")

   End Sub

</PRE><h3>Method 2: Refer to the Chart as ActiveChart</h3>
 
<P>
If it is not necessary to assign an object variable to the chart, refer to
the chart as ActiveChart. For example, the following macro statement uses
the ActiveChart property and Location method to move a chart to a chart
sheet named Chart1:
<P>
<PRE>   ActiveChart.Location where:=xlLocationAsNewSheet, Name:="Chart1"

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
You can move a chart to a new location in Visual Basic for Applications
by using the Location method. The first argument, Where, designates the
location to which you want to move the chart. The valid locations and their
associated XlChartLocation constants are listed in the following table.
<P>
<PRE>   Location            Constant
   ----------------------------------------

   Chart sheet         XlLocationAsNewSheet
   Chart sheet         XlLocationAutomatic
   Worksheet object    XlLocationAsObject

</PRE><h2>REFERENCES</h2>
 
<P>
For more information about the Location method, click the Index tab in
Help, type the following text
