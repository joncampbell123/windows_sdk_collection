The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you click the Refresh Data or the Edit Query button on the External
Data toolbar, you receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   [INTERSOLV][Macintosh ODBC Driver Manager] Data source name not found
   and no default driver specified

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may occur when you attempt to update or edit a query that has
been created in Microsoft Excel version 5.0.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
After you install the Data Access component that is included in the
Microsoft Office 98 Macintosh Edition Value Pack, you must specify which
Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) driver each existing ODBC data source
will use before you can use the data source with Microsoft Office 98
Macintosh Edition.
<P>
The following steps show you how to specify the ODBC driver to use for an
example data source named "Northwind" so that it uses the new "Microsoft
3.01 dBASE PPC" ODBC driver that is included with Microsoft Office 98
Macintosh Edition. You can use similar steps to modify other data sources.
<P>
Assume this example data source previously used the "Q+E/Microsoft FoxPro
Driver" ODBC driver to access the sample FoxPro files that were included
with Office 4.2.x.
<P>
IMPORTANT: To use this workaround, the ODBC Preferences file must be
present on your computer. By default, the ODBC Preferences file is located
in the System Folder:Preferences folder.

<OL><P><LI>Create a User DSN that uses the new ODBC driver that you want to use.
   This data source will serve as a model for the data source that you want
   to use.
<P>
   In this example, create a User DSN that uses the "Microsoft 3.01 dBASE
   PPC" ODBC driver. To do this, follow these steps:
<P>
<P><PRE>    a. Point to Control Panels on the Apple menu, and then click ODBC Setup
       PPC.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    b. Click the User DSN tab in the "ODBC Data Source Administrator"
       dialog box.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    c. Click Add. Click "Microsoft 3.01 dBASE PPC," and then click Finish.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    d. Type "Test Data Source" (without the quotation marks) in the Data
       Source Name box, and then click OK.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    e. Click OK to close the "ODBC Data Source Administrator" dialog box.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Open the ODBC Preferences and ODBC Preferences PPC files in Microsoft
   Word. By default, the files are located in the System Folder:Preferences
   folder. Each file should have a layout similar to the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      [ODBC Data Sources]
      Test Data Source=Microsoft 3.01 dBASE PPC
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      [Test Data Source]
      MacFileInfo=FOXX,F+DB,F+DT,F+IX,FCDX,FDBC
      TranslateOption=
      Translate=
      TranslateDLL=
      ApplicationUsingThreads=1
      UseLongQualifiers=0
      UseLongNames=1
      IntlSort=0
      DataFileExtension=DBF
      CacheSize=4
      FileOpenCache=0
      LockCompatibility=Fox
      Locking=None
      CreateType=FoxPro25
      Database=Drive_8:Microsoft
      Description=INTERSOLV dBASE Driver PPC
      Driver=MS:ODBC:3.01:dBASE Driver
</PRE><P>
   The [ODBC Data Sources] section in the ODBC Preferences file contains
   one entry for each data source that you have created for Office 4.2.x.
   The [ODBC Data Sources] section in the ODBC Preferences PPC file
   contains a list of all of the User DSN data sources that you have
   created. Each line in the [ODBC Data Sources] section uses this
   format:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Data Source Name=ODBC Driver Name
</PRE><P>
   Each data source that is listed in the [ODBC Data Sources] section
   has a separate section in the file, which contains the setting for that
   particular data source.

<P><LI>Switch to the ODBC Preferences file in Microsoft Word. Select the
   section for a data source that you want to migrate to Microsoft Office
   98 Macintosh Edition, and then click Copy on the Edit menu.
<P>
   In this example, select all of the entries in the [Northwind] section,
   including the section heading.

<P><LI>Switch to the ODBC Preferences PPC file. Insert a new line at the end of
   the file, and then Click Paste on the Edit menu.

<P><LI>Add a new line to the [ODBC Data Sources] section in the ODBC
   Preferences PPC file. The new line should contain the name of the data
   source that you want to use on the left side of the equal sign. The
   name of the new ODBC driver should be on the right side of the equal
   sign. In this example, type the new line as follows:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Northwind=Microsoft 3.01 dBASE PPC
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: You can use Test Data Source that you created in step 1 as a
   model.

<P><LI>Change the entry on the Driver= line to indicate the updated ODBC
   driver.
<P>
   In this example, change the Driver= line in the [Northwind] section to
   the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Driver=MS:ODBC:3.01:dBASE Driver
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: You can use Test Data Source that you created in step 1 as a
   model.

<P><LI>To save the ODBC Preferences PPC file, click Save on the File menu.
   Click Yes to Continue to save the file in the Text Only format.

<P><LI>After the file is saved, click Close on the File menu to close the
   document.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
