The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you copy a worksheet in Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition, the
following problems may occur:

<UL><LI>AutoShapes, drawing objects, charts, and other objects in the worksheet
   that do not appear or that are represented by placeholders in the
   original worksheet are displayed.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>AutoShapes, drawing objects, charts, and other objects appear in one
   worksheet but not in another worksheet even though they are present in
   the worksheet.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
These problems occur if the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>The worksheet you are copying contains one or more embedded charts.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>Show Placeholders or Hide All is selected in the View tab of the
   Preferences dialog box (Click Preferences on the Tools menu).
<P>
</UL><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, use the following appropriate method to reset
the Objects setting.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1: Objects Are Displayed</h3>
 
<P>
If objects appear in the worksheet, use the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Preferences. Click the View tab.

<P><LI>Under Objects, click the option you want to use. For example, click Show
   All, Show Placeholders, or Hide All.

<P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
</OL>The change is applied to all of the worksheets in the workbook.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 2: Some Objects Are Not Displayed</h3>
 
<P>
If some objects do not appear, use the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Preferences. Click the View tab.

<P><LI>Under Objects, click Hide All.

<P><LI>Click OK.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Preferences. Click the View tab.

<P><LI>Under Objects, click the setting you want to use. For example, click
   Show All, Show Placeholders, or Hide All.

<P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
</OL>The change is applied to all of the worksheets in the workbook.
<P>
NOTE: If the Objects setting for the copied worksheet is Hide All, and you
copy the worksheet in a single workbook, objects in the original worksheet
may not be visible even though the Objects setting for the workbook is Show
All. If this behavior occurs, use the second method in this article to
restore the objects on the worksheet to the normal behavior.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
