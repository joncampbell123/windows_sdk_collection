<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If you are using Microsoft Excel version 4.0 or later, you can use the
CUMIPMT function to return the cumulative interest paid on a loan between a 
start period and an end period.
<P>
In all versions of Microsoft Excel, you can use the IPMT function to
return the interest payment for a single given period for an investment
based on periodic and constant payments, and a constant interest rate. To
calculate the total interest paid over a range of time (multiple periods),
the IPMT function can be used in an array formula as described in the
"More Information" section of this article.
<P>
Note also that if you are using Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, you can use 
the Loan Manager template to analyze various aspects of your loan including 
the interest saved by refinancing or prepaying principal. 
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To determine the total interest paid for the first year (periods 1-12),
assuming that the annual interest rate is 13 percent, the number of periods 
is equal to 360 months, and the present value of the loan is equal to 
negative $100,000; enter the following in a worksheet:
<P>
<PRE>    A1: Total interest paid in Year 1
    A2: =SUM(IPMT(13%/12,ROW(A1:A12),360,-100000))

</PRE>NOTE: The formula in A2 must be entered as an array formula. To enter a
formula as an array formula in Microsoft Excel for Windows, press
CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER. To enter a formula as an array in Microsoft Excel for  
the Macintosh, press COMMAND+RETURN.
<P>
The value returned in cell A2 is $12,983.05.
<P>
The ROW function is used in this formula to return an array of period
numbers and any range can be used here. In this example, ROW(A1:A12)
returns {1;2;3;4;5;6;7;8;9;10;11;12}.
<P>
This method works for any other range of periods. For example, to calculate 
the interest paid for the second year, type the range A13:A24 in place of 
A1:A12 in the ROW function.
