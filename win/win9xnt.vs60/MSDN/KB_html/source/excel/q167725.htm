</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 97, when you print a worksheet or chart that contains
drawing objects or AutoShapes, the following problems may occur:

<UL><LI>Objects that are empty are printed with a black fill.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Objects that contain a gradient fill are printed with a rainbow fill.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Shadows are printed using the wrong color (green instead of black).
<P>
</UL>In addition, an "Out of memory" message may appear on the printer display
panel when you print a very large or complex worksheet or chart.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
These problems may occur if the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>You are printing to a Hewlett-Packard DeskJet 1600c ColorSmart printer.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>The version number of the printer driver is earlier than 4.2.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve these problems, download and install a newer printer driver
from the Hewlett-Packard Web site.
<P>
To obtain a new driver for your printer, use your Web browser to go to the
following address:
<P>
<PRE>   <B>http://hpcc920.external.hp.com/cposupport/indexes1/dj1600cs.html</B>

</PRE>Then, click the Download Page link, scroll down to the "Download
Information" section, and click the link for the driver you want to
download (U.S. or Europe). If you are prompted to open or save the file,
save it in a folder on your hard disk. Then, run the file. After the file
is decompressed, run the Setup.exe file in that folder to install the new
printer driver.
<P>
NOTE: Microsoft does not support the downloading and installation of
printer drivers from the Hewlett-Packard Web site. If you require
assistance downloading and installing drivers, contact Hewlett-Packard
technical support. The Hewlett-Packard Web address is correct as of April
23, 1997. You can also view the main Hewlett-Packard Web site at the
following address:

<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This problem was corrected in version 4.2 of the Hewlett-Packard DeskJet
1600c ColorSmart printer driver.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Note that if you download and install a newer printer driver for the
Hewlett-Packard DeskJet 1600c ColorSmart printer, you may still receive an
"Out of memory" message when you print very large or complex documents. If
this behavior occurs, try upgrading the memory in your printer.
<P>
Hewlett-Packard DeskJet 1600c printers may contain from 4 MB to 100 MB of
random access memory. When you install more memory in the printer, the
message is less likely to appear.
