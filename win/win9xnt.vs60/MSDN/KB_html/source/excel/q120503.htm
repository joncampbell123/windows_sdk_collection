The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, version 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel version 5.0, if you save a workbook that contains a
defined name, and the defined name refers to a formula that contains a
relative reference, the reference in the defined name is no longer relative
when you save the file to the Microsoft Excel 4.0 Worksheet or Workbook
file format, and open the file in Microsoft Excel version 4.0.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs if you create a name that refers to a formula that
contains a relative reference. For example, this behavior occurs if you
create the name TEST that refers to the following formula, relative to cell
A1 on a worksheet:
<P>
<PRE>   =SUM(Sheet1!B1)

</PRE>When you use this name in cell A1 on Sheet1, the result is the sum of
the values in cell B1. When you use this name in cell A2 on Sheet1,
the result is the sum of the values in cell B2, and so on.
<P>
However, in Microsoft Excel version 5.0, if you save this file to the
Microsoft Excel 4.0 Worksheet or Workbook format, and then open the
file in Microsoft Excel version 4.0, the formula in the defined name
behaves as an absolute reference, even though the name appears to
refer to a relative reference. For example, the value in each cell
that contains the name defined above is the sum of the values in cell
B1, or the value of the following reference
<P>
<PRE>   =SUM(Sheet1!$B$1)

</PRE>even though the reference of the defined name is still the relative
reference defined above.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
To avoid this behavior, do either of the following:

<UL><LI>Create a defined name that contains a relative reference without
   including the reference in a formula. For example, the problem does not
   occur when you create a name that refers to the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      =SHEET1!B1
</PRE><P>
   -or-

<LI>When you open the file in Microsoft Excel version 4.0, you can correct
   the incorrect references by using the Define Name dialog box with the
   following steps:
<P>
   1. From the Formula menu, choose Define Name.
<P>
   2. From the Names in Sheet list, select the name that you want to
<P><PRE>      correct.
</PRE><P>
   3. Choose the Add button.
<P>
   4. Choose Close.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in a
later version of Microsoft Excel.
