The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Excel 97 uses a different method to edit, delete and restore
menus and menu items than earlier versions of Microsoft Excel.
<P>
This article explains the difference between a toolbar, a menu bar and a
command bar in Microsoft Excel 97. It also explains in detail how to
perform the following actions in Microsoft Excel 97:

<UL><LI>How to delete an entire menu
<LI>How to delete a single menu item
<LI>How to restore an entire menu
<LI>How to restore a single menu item
<LI>How to change settings for a specific menu item
<LI>How to reset a menu item to its original settings
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel versions 5.0 and 7.0, there are toolbars and menu bars:
<P>
<P><h3>Toolbars</h3>
 

<UL><LI>Contain toolbar buttons

<LI>Can be docked and can float

<LI>Click Toolbars on the View menu to edit
<P>
<P>
</UL><h3>Menu Bars</h3>
 

<UL><LI>Contain menus and menu items

<LI>Can only be docked (at the top of the screen)

<LI>Click Menu Editor on the Tools menu in a Visual Basic module sheet
   to edit
<P>
<P>
</UL>In Microsoft Excel 97, toolbars and menu bars are not separate entities,
but have been replaced by command bars. Command bars include all of the
functionality of toolbars and menu bars as well as new functionality:
<P>
<P><h3>Command Bars</h3>
 

<UL><LI>Contain toolbar buttons, menus, AND menu items

<LI>Can be docked on any edge of the screen, and can float

<LI>Click Toolbars on the View menu to edit
<P>
</UL>Even though toolbars and menu bars no longer exist in Microsoft Excel 97,
most Visual Basic macro commands designed to work with these items still
function, and some elements of the user interface still use the older
terminology. For example, there is still a Toolbars menu item on the View
menu.
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 97, you edit command bars through the Customize dialog
box. To display this dialog box, click Customize on the Tools menu.
<P>
The Customize dialog box is a special dialog box: while it is displayed,
you can still click menus, menu items, and toolbar buttons contained within
your command bars.
<P>
NOTE: In the following steps, when you are instructed to click a menu or
menu item, don't click inside the Customize dialog box. Instead, click the
actual menu or menu item.
<P>
