<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, when you use the ON.TIME and WAIT macro functions,
it is important to remember that there is no guarantee that the macro
specified will run at exactly the time indicated.
<P>
Microsoft Excel guarantees only that the macro will run if it is at
least the time indicated or the specified amount of time has elapsed
since the ON.TIME or WAIT statement was executed.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To understand why Microsoft Excel, or any Microsoft Windows
application, cannot guarantee an action to occur at a specific time,
it is necessary to look at the Microsoft Windows operating
environment.
<P>
Microsoft Windows functions as a messaging system, with each
application receiving the processor for a period of time to handle any
messages that are in its message queue.
<P>
If you use ON.TIME to execute the macro TEST.XLM at noon, Microsoft
Excel will not run it before noon, but it is possible that Microsoft
Excel may not run TEST.XLM until 12:05.
<P>
This delay occurs because Microsoft Excel may not have the processor
at noon; another application may be processing messages in its message
queue and may not release the processor until it is finished. When the
other application releases the processor and Microsoft Excel gains
control, it will process messages in its queue, including the one that
tells it to run TEST.XLM.
