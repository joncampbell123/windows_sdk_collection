The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you open a file, Microsoft Excel 97 may take a long time to open the
file. Also, after you open the file in Microsoft Excel and save it, the
file may increase significantly in size.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may occur when the following conditions are met:

<UL><LI>You open a file that was created Microsoft Excel version 5.0 or 7.0.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>The file contains a large number of cell notes.
<P>
</UL>Microsoft Excel 97 uses comments instead of notes. The file opens slowly
because Microsoft Excel 97 converts the cell notes to cell comments.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
If the cell notes are not needed, you can work around this problem by
reopening the file in Microsoft Excel 5.0 or 7.0, and clearing all the
notes in the workbook. The file should then open significantly faster in
Microsoft Excel 97.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Like cell notes, comments are attached to worksheet cells. You can view
each comment when you move the pointer over the cell, or you can view all
of the comments at the same time. You can print comments in the same
locations in which they appear on the worksheet, or you can print comments
in a list at the end of the worksheet. Also, Microsoft Excel adds your user
name to the top of each cell note that you insert on your worksheet.
<P>
<P><h2>REFERENCES</h2>
 
<P>
For more information about Cell Comments, click the Index tab in
Microsoft Excel Help, type the following text
<P>
<PRE>   comments

</PRE>and then double-click the selected text to go to the "Add a comment to a
cell" topic.
