<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In earlier versions of Microsoft Excel, when you create a Visual Basic for
Applications macro that performs multiple deletions or clears cells
multiple times, you must save the workbook to release the random access
memory that is no longer being used. In Microsoft Excel 97, you can free
this memory by using the UsedRange Property in a macro.
<P>
Additionally, the UsedRange property in Microsoft Excel 97 refers to only
the occupied range of cells. In earlier versions of Microsoft Excel, the
UsedRange property includes cells that are referred to (by formulas) but
not occupied with data.
<P>
NOTE: The UsedRange Property does exist in earlier versions of Microsoft
Excel. This particular functionality is new in Microsoft Excel 97.
<P>
This article contains a sample macro that resets the used range of cells on
the active worksheet.
<P>

Microsoft provides examples of Visual Basic for Applications procedures
for illustration only, without warranty either expressed or implied,
including, but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability
and/or fitness for a particular purpose. The Visual Basic procedures in
this article are provided 'as is' and Microsoft does not guarantee that
they can be used in all situations. While Microsoft support engineers can
help explain the functionality of a particular macro, they will not modify
these examples to provide added functionality, nor will they help you
construct macros to meet your specific needs. If you have limited
programming experience, you may want to consult one of the Microsoft
Solution Providers. Solution Providers offer a wide range of fee-based
services, including creating custom macros. For more information about

range of cells on the active sheet. The used range of cells is cell A1
through the last cell that is found. To find the last cell, use the
following steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Edit menu, click Go To.

<P><LI>Click Special.
