</PRE><h3>Introduction</h3>
 
<P>
The WE1130 disk included with this Application Note contains a Lotus
1-2-3 WK4 file converter for use with Microsoft Excel versions 5.0,
5.0a, and 5.0c for Windows. This converter allows you to convert your
existing Lotus 1-2-3 Release 4 or 5 for Windows files to Microsoft
Excel 5.0 files.
<P>
Microsoft Excel 5.0 for Windows shipped without the ability to open or
save files in WK4 format. The file converter provided with this
Application Note allows you to use Microsoft Excel version 5.0, 5.0a,
or 5.0c to open WK4 files. This file converter does not provide the
functionality to save a file in Microsoft Excel to the WK4 file
format.
<P>
<PRE>  NOTE: The Lotus 1-2-3 WK4 file converter does not work with
  Microsoft Excel for Windows NT(TM).

</PRE><h3>To install the Lotus 1-2-3 WK4 converter</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>  NOTE: If you are running Microsoft Excel from a protected network
  server drive or if you want to install the converter to a location
  other than the Microsoft Excel directory, see the "Alternative
  Installation Method" section of this Application Note.

</PRE><P><LI>Quit Microsoft Excel for Windows.

<P><LI>If you received this Application Note on a disk, insert the
   enclosed WE1130 disk in your floppy disk drive.

<P><LI>In Windows Program Manager, choose Run from the File menu.

<P><LI>In the Command Line box, type &lt;location&gt;:\setup.exe and press ENTER
   (where &lt;location&gt; is the floppy disk drive that contains the WE1130
   disk or, if you received this Application Note electronically, the
   disk or directory to which you downloaded the file). For example,
   if the disk is in drive A, type
<P>
<P><PRE>      a:\setup.exe
</PRE><P>
   or, if the downloaded Application Note is in the directory
   C:\DNLOADS, type:
<P>
<P><PRE>      c:\dnloads\setup.exe
</PRE><P>
</OL>When the Setup program is finished, a dialog box will appear,
confirming that the WK4 file converter has been installed.
<P>
<PRE>  NOTE: For information about installing the Lotus 1-2-3 WK4 file
  converter from a directory on a network drive, and for more
  information about using the file converter, see the README.TXT file
  on the enclosed WE1130 disk or in the location to which you
  downloaded this Application Note.

</PRE></OL>When you run the Setup program, it copies the XLCONVW4.DLL file to
your Microsoft Excel directory. The rest of the files included on the
WE1130 disk are used to run the Setup program.
<P>
When you run the Setup program, if you receive an error message
stating that Setup tried to create an invalid path or that Setup
cannot find Microsoft Excel, use the method described in the
"Alternative Installation Method" section on page page 2 of this
Application Note to install the converter to a location other than the
Microsoft Excel directory.
<P>
<P><h3>To use the Lotus 1-2-3 WK4 file converter</h3>
 
<P>
After you install this converter, do the following to open your
existing Lotus 1-2-3 Release 4 or 5 files in Microsoft Excel:

<OL><P><LI>In Microsoft Excel, choose Open from the File menu.

<P><LI>From the List Files Of Type list, select
   Lotus 1-2-3 Release 4 or 5 (*.WK4).

<P><LI>From the File Name list, select the file that you want to open, and
   choose OK.
<P>
</OL><h3>Alternative Installation Method</h3>
 
<P>
Use this method if you are running Microsoft Excel from a protected
network server drive or if you want to install the converter to a
location other than the Microsoft Excel directory.

<OL><P><LI>Quit Microsoft Excel for Windows.

<P><LI>If you received this Application Note on a disk, insert the
   enclosed WE1130 disk in the appropriate floppy disk drive.

<P><LI>In Windows Program Manager, choose Run from the File menu.

<P><LI>In the Command Line box, type &lt;location&gt;:\wk4iniup.exe and press
   ENTER (where &lt;location&gt; is the floppy disk drive that contains the
   WE1130 disk or, if you received this Application Note
   electronically, the disk or directory to which you downloaded the
   file). For example, if the disk is in drive A, type
<P>
<P><PRE>      a:\wk4iniup.exe
</PRE><P>
   or, if the downloaded Application Note is in the directory
   C:\DNLOADS, type:
<P>
<P><PRE>      c:\dnloads\wk4iniup.exe
</PRE><P>
   The WK4 Converter Excel5.INI Updater dialog box will appear.

<P><LI>In the Install DLL To box, enter the name of directory in which you
   want to install the converter, such as C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM.
<P>
<P><PRE>      Note that the location that you enter in the Install DLL To box
      must be an existing directory.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Choose the Install XLCONVW4.DLL button.
<P>
   If you have already installed the converter, a dialog box will
   appear telling you that the converter is already listed in your
   EXCEL5.INI file. This dialog box will display both the current path
   and the new path that you entered, and it will ask if you still
   want to update this information.

<P><LI>Choose Yes to install the converter to the new location.
<P>
   If you enter an incorrect path, or if there is not enough disk
   space on the drive, the following error message will appear:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Can't Write File
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      The file XLCONVW4.DLL could not be written because there is not
      enough space to write destination file, the destination path is
      not valid, or the destination is protected. Please verify
      destination path.
</PRE><P>
   To correct this problem, you must either free up some disk space on
   the drive to which you are installing the converter or enter
   another location for the converter.
<P>
</OL>When the Updater program is finished, a dialog box will appear,
confirming that your EXCEL5.INI file has been updated with the
converter information. This dialog box will also tell you the
converter number of the added Lotus 1-2-3 WK4 converter.
<P>
<PRE>  NOTE: For information about installing the Lotus 1-2-3 WK4 file
  converter from a directory on a network drive, and for more
  information about using the file converter, see the README.TXT file
  on the enclosed WE1130 disk or in the location to which you
  downloaded this Application Note.

</PRE></OL>When you run the Updater program, it copies the XLCONVW4.DLL file to
the location that you entered in the Install DLL To box. The rest of
the files in the DISK1 directory are used to run the Setup program.
