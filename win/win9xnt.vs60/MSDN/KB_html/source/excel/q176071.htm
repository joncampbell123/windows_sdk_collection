The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you print a worksheet that contains an object that contains scroll
bars, the scroll arrows on the object are not printed as they appear on the
worksheet. Instead of printing the arrows with an arrowhead as they appear
on the screen, Microsoft Excel prints the arrows with both an arrowhead and
a shaft.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when you do the following:

<UL><LI>You print a Forms control that contains scroll bars.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>You are running Microsoft Excel under Macintosh operating system version
   8.0 (Mac OS 8.0).
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Forms toolbar contains several controls that you can insert into your
worksheet. However, when you insert the List Box or Scroll Bar control, and
then print the worksheet, the scroll arrows on the printed output are
different from the scroll arrows on the screen. The arrows are printed with
a shaft even though the shaft does not appear on the screen.
<P>
<P><h2>REFERENCES</h2>
 
<P>

Help, type the following text
