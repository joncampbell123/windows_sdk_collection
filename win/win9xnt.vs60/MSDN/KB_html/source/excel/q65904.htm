<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you enter two numbers separated by a slash (/) on a Microsoft
Excel spreadsheet, Excel treats the entry differently, based on the
numbers, and which version of Excel is being used.
<P>
If Alternate Navigation Keys is disabled in Version 3.00 of Excel,
the different version of Excel treat the entries the same.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
To illustrate this, consider what would happen if you input an entry
X/Y.
<P>
There are two categories; (A) X is greater than 12, (B) X is between
1 and 12.
<P>
<P>
(A)  X is GREATER than 12:
<PRE>        In Excel 2.xx, the two numbers will be displayed as entered,
        and considered text.

        In Excel 3.00, if Alternate Navigations Keys are enabled,
        the two numbers will be displayed as a fraction, and
        considered a number.  If Alternate Navigations Keys are
        disabled, the entry will behave as in Excel 2.xx.


</PRE>(B)  X is a number BETWEEN 1 and 12: Excel tests for a possible
<PRE>        date entry by looking at the Y entry.

        IF X is between 1 and 12, and Y is as follows:


        1. Inclusively between 1900 and 2078, the entry is treated
        as a month and year

        2. A valid day for the month to which X translates (for
        example, X=2=February - Valid Y entries are 1-28), the
        entry is treated as a month and day

        3. Either 0 or a 2-digit number that is too large to be
        a valid day for the month to which X translates, the
        entry is treated as a month and year (1900 + Y)

        (THE ABOVE 3 POSSIBILITIES APPLY TO ALL VERSIONS OF EXCEL)


        4. For Excel version 2.xx: Anything else, the entry is
        treated exactly as it has been input.

           For Excel version 3.00: If Alternate Navigation Keys
        are enabled, the entry will be entered as a fraction and
        considered a number.  If Alternate Navigation Keys are
        disabled, the entry is treated as input.

</PRE><h3>Examples</h3>
 
<P>
The following are examples:
<P>
<PRE>You Enter            Excel 2.xx Enters    In Formula Bar
-----------          -----------------    --------------

 2/20                   20-Feb              2/20/1990
 5/80                   May-80              5/01/1980
 13/90                  13/90               13/90
 2/2079                 2/2079              2/2079


</PRE>With Alternate Navigation Keys enabled
<PRE>You Enter            Excel 3.00 Enters    In Formula Bar
-----------          -----------------    --------------

 2/20                   20-Feb              2/20/1990
 5/80                   May-80              5/01/1980
 13/90                  0.14444             =13/90
 2/2079                 0.00096             =2/2079
