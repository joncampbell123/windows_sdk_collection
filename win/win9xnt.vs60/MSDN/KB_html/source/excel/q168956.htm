The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you drag and drop a merged cell in Microsoft Excel 97, you may receive
the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Cannot change part of a merged cell.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs if either of the following conditions is true:

<UL><LI>The location to which you are dragging the merged cell overlaps the
   original location of the merged cell.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE>
<LI>The location to which you are dragging the merged cell overlaps another
   merged cell without completely covering it.
<P>
</UL>NOTE: If the new location of the merged cell completely covers another
merged cell, the problem does not occur.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To prevent this problem from occurring, make sure that when you drag and
drop a merged cell, the new location of the merged cell does not overlap
any existing merged cells without completely covering them.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design of Microsoft Excel 97.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Excel 97 includes a new feature that enables you to merge a range
of cells into a single, merged cell. To use this feature, select the cells
that you want to merge, and then perform either of the following steps:

<UL><LI>On the Format menu, click Cells. Select the Alignment tab. Click to
   select the Merge Cells check box, and click OK.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE>
<LI>Click the Merge And Center tool on the Formatting toolbar.
<P>
</UL>The following steps demonstrate the problem described in this article:

<OL><P><LI>In a new worksheet, select the range B2:C6. On the Formatting toolbar,
   click the Merge And Center tool.

<P><LI>Repeat step 1, selecting and merging the ranges E2:F3 and F6:H12.
<P>
   Your worksheet now contains three merged cells.

<P><LI>Select the merged cell that covers the range B2:C6. Drag the cell so
   that it covers the range C2:D6. Release the mouse button.
<P>
   The new location of the merged cell (C2:D6) overlaps the original
   location of the merged cell (B2:C6), so you receive the error message
   mentioned in the "Symptoms" section.

<P><LI>Select the merged cell that covers the range B2:C6. Drag the cell so
   that it covers the range D2:E6. Release the mouse button.
<P>
   You receive the error message mentioned in the "Symptoms" section,
   because the new location of the merged cell (D2:E6) overlaps, but does
   not completely cover, the merged cell at E2:F3.

<P><LI>Select the merged cell that covers the range B2:C6. Drag the cell so
   that it covers the range F6:G10.
<P>
   Again, you receive the error message mentioned in the "Symptoms"
   section, because the merged cell does not completely cover the merged
   cell at F6:H12.
