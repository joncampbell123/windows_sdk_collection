<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, if you use the Flat File add-in macro to export a
noncontiguous selection to a text file, each individual range is
printed below the previous one, regardless of the relationship of the
two ranges on the worksheet.
<P>
Note that in Microsoft Excel version 5.0, you can use the Text Import
Wizard when you open a text file to control what data to import and how the
data should be spread across columns.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Flat File (FLATFILE.XLA) allows you to export data from a worksheet to
a text file. It will not preserve the relative positions of ranges to
each other when you export a noncontiguous selection. For example, if
the data that you are exporting includes the noncontiguous ranges
A1:A4 and D1:D4, you might expect the resulting text file to consist
of two columns of data. However, because Flat File treats each range
in the non-contiguous selection separately, you will see a single
column of data containing the values from both ranges in the resulting
text file.
<P>
Note: The "Microsoft Excel User's Guide" version 3.0 states on page
684 that the export range you select must be a contiguous range. The
"Microsoft Excel User's Guide 2" version 4.0 states on page 152 that
the export range must be contiguous. This is incorrect. Flat File is
able to export a noncontiguous selection.
<P>
<P><h3>Workaround</h3>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design. To work around this behavior, you must
manipulate the ranges to export so that they are next to each other
and select them as a contiguous range. In some cases, you can do this
by hiding the columns or rows that you do not want to include in your
export range, as the Flat File macro will only export what is
displayed on the screen.
