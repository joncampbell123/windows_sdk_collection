The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Query for Windows, version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you perform a workstation installation of Microsoft Query, you may
receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Cue Cards file was launched with Runtime but Cue Cards Cannot Find or
   Open file or File may be locked

</PRE><h2>CAUSES</h2>
 
<P>
This error message occurs when you use the double backslashes (\\) of the
universal naming convention (UNC) in the command line of the Microsoft
Query icon, (\\MYSERVER\MSAPPS\MSQUERY\MSQUERY.EXE, for example).
<P>
NOTE: You may also receive this error message when choosing Get External
Data from the Data menu in Microsoft Excel. You may receive the error if
there are WIN.INI entries for Microsoft Query which do not contain drive
letters in paths.  If you receive this error while choosing Get External
Data from the Data menu, ensure that the following paths in the WIN.INI
contain drive letters:
<P>
[MSAPPS]
MSQuery=
<P>
[Microsoft Query]
MSQuery=
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND #1</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, change the command line to include a drive
letter, as in the following example:
<P>
<PRE>   G:\MYSERVER\MSAPPS\MSQUERY\MSQUERY.EXE

</PRE>To modify the command line of the Microsoft Query icon, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>In Program Manager, select the program group where the Microsoft Query
   icon appears. Select the Microsoft Query icon by clicking it.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Properties.

<P><LI>Select the Command Line box, remove the UNC (\\), and modify the path to
   indicate the drive letter of the path where the MSQUERY.EXE file is
   located.
<P>
</OL><h2>WORKAROUND #2</h2>
 
<P>
Set the Tutorial option in the MSQUERY.INI file to 0. This prevents the cue
cards from running.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
This problem does not occur with version 2.0 of Cue Cards, the version that
ships with our newest releases. This includes Microsoft Office 4.2, 4.3,
and Microsoft Excel 5.0a. If you install Microsoft Excel 5.0a, UNC pathing
should work correctly for MSQuery.
