called OK. This button is already selected when the dialog box is
displayed.
<P>
OK Button, Not Default -- Item 3
 
<P>
OK can be a trigger when 103 is used as an item number. OK closes the
dialog box, enters the data from the dialog box into the

the button appears in the text column; the button does not have to be
called OK.
<P>

Formula Edit Box -- Item 9
 
<P>
The formula edit box cannot be triggered. It is like a text edit box,
except it accepts all formulas. References in the initial/result
column are always R1C1-style in the form of text. When these
references are displayed in the dialog box, they are converted to the
current style of the Microsoft Excel workspace (A1 style is default).
If you enter a constant, an equal sign is added before it. If you
enter text, it is enclosed in quotation marks.

box, except you can enter only references. References in the
initial/result column are always R1C1-style in the form of text. When
these references are displayed in the dialog box, they are converted

<P>

<P>
The option button group can be a trigger when 111 is used as an item
number. An option button group item must immediately precede each
group of option buttons. The text column can contain a label for the
group. The initial/result column contains the number of selected
option buttons in the following group. The button in the row below the
option button group item is button number 1, the next is number 2,

of option buttons, only one button can be selected. The text column

column contains TRUE if the check box is turned on, FALSE if it is
turned off, or #N/A if the check box is unavailable.
<P>
Group Box -- Item 14
 
<P>
The group box cannot be triggered. It is a box used to visually group
items within your dialog box. The text column can contain a label for
the group.
<P>
List Box -- Item 15
 
<P>
The list box can be a trigger when 115 is used as an item number. It's
a box containing a list of items. This list is specified in the text
column with a name or R1C1-style reference, in the form of text, to a
range of cells that contain items for the list box. If the reference
is to blank cells or is invalid, no items are displayed in the list
box.
<P>
The initial/result column contains the number of the selected item in
the list box. The first item in the list is number 1, and so on. If
the initial/result column is blank, number 1 is assumed. If the
initial/result column contains #N/A, no items are selected. If the
initial/result column contains a valid name, the list box becomes a
multiple selection list box, in which the user can select more than
one item from the list. If the name does not exist, Excel will create
it. Otherwise, the name can be initialized to refer to a single number
or a one-dimensional array (comma separated) of numbers corresponding
to the positions in the list of the desired initially selected values.
Once you select items from the list and close the dialog box, the
numbers in the named array are changed to match the items you have
selected. The numbers appear in ascending order in the array.
<P>
Linked List Box -- Item 16
 
<P>
Can be a trigger when 116 is used as an item number. It's like a list
box, except it must be preceded by a text edit box. When an item is
selected in the linked list box, the text of that item is displayed in
the edit box. The text column contains a name or an R1C1-style
reference, in the form of text, to a range of cells that contains
items for the list box. If the reference is to blank cells or is
invalid, no items are displayed in the list box. The initial/result
column contains the number of the selected item in the list. The first
item in the list is number 1, and so on. If the initial/result column
contains #N/A, no items are selected.
<P>
Icon -- Item 17
 
<P>
The icon cannot be triggered. It displays one of three icons. A 1 in
the text column displays a question mark icon, 2 displays the i or
information icon, 3 displays the exclamation mark icon.
<P>
Linked File List Box -- Item 18
 
<P>
Can be a trigger when 118 is used as an item number. It lists files in a
directory. It must precede a linked drive and directory list box and
must follow a text edit box. The edit box is used to filter filenames
to appear in the linked file list box. The text column is ignored.
<P>
Linked Drive and Directory List Box -- Item 19
 
<P>
The linked drive and directory list box can be a trigger when 119 is
used as an item number. Lists available drives and directories. Must
immediately follow a linked file list box. If a fixed-text item
immediately follows a linked-drive-and-directory-list-box item, the
fixed-text item displays the name of the current drive and directory,
and is updated if the drive or directory changes. The text and
initial/result columns are ignored.
<P>
Directory Text -- Item 20
 
<P>
Directory text cannot be triggered. It displays the name of the
current directory. It does not change after the dialog box is
displayed. To display the directory name so it will change as the
directory is changed, insert an item 5 after an item 19. The text
column and initial/result column are ignored.
<P>
Drop-Down List Box -- Item 21
 
<P>
The drop-down list box can be a trigger when 121 is used as an item
number. It contains a list of items. The text column contains a
reference to the items contained in the list. This can be an
R1C1-style reference given as text, a name of a reference, or a name
of an array. If the reference is to blank cells or is invalid, no
items are displayed in the list. The height column contains the length
of the drop-down list when it is displayed. The initial/result column
contains the number of the selected list item. The first item in the
list is number 1, and so on. If the initial/result column is blank,
number 1 is assumed. If the initial/result column contains #N/A, no
items are selected.
<P>
Drop-Down Combination Edit/List Box -- Item 22
 
<P>
The drop-down combination edit/list box cannot be triggered. It is
like a drop-down list box, except it must be preceded by a text edit
box. You can edit the item in the edit box before the list is
displayed. The height column contains the length of the drop-down list
when it is displayed. The text column contains a reference to the
items contained in the list. This can be an R1C1-style reference given
as text, a name of a reference, or a name of an array. If the
reference is to blank cells or is invalid, no items are displayed in
the list.
<P>
The initial/result column contains the number of the selected list
item. The first item in the list is number 1, and so on. If the
initial/result column contains #N/A, the initial value is taken from
the preceding text edit box. If the initial/result column is blank,
