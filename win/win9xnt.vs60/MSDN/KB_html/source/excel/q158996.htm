The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you double-click a Microsoft Excel workbook (.xls file) in Windows
Explorer, Microsoft Excel 97 does not open the file.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may occur if either of the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>The Ignore Other Applications setting in Microsoft Excel 97 is
   selected.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE>
<LI>You previously used the Get External Data command on the Data menu
   to retrieve data from an external database.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this behavior, use the following appropriate method.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1</h3>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 97, on the Tools menu, click Options. Click the General
tab. Clear the Ignore Other Applications checkbox, and click OK.
<P>
After you do this, you should be able to open workbooks by double-clicking
them in the Windows Explorer.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 2</h3>
 
<P>
If you clicked Get External Data to retrieve data from an external
database, you can open a workbook by doing either of the following:

<UL><LI>On the File menu, click Open. In the Open dialog box, select the file
   you want to open, and then click Open.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE>
<LI>Quit and restart Microsoft Excel 97. After you restart the program,
   you can open a workbook by double-clicking it in Windows Explorer.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
The first symptom, where double-clicking a workbook fails when the Ignore
Other Applications setting is selected, is by design of Microsoft Excel 97.
<P>
The second symptom, where double-clicking a workbook fails after you use
the Get External Data command, has been confirmed by Microsoft to be a
problem in the Microsoft products listed at the beginning of this article.
We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you double-click a Microsoft Excel workbook in the Windows Explorer, a
dynamic data exchange (DDE) message is sent to Microsoft Excel, instructing
it to open the workbook you double-clicked.
<P>
If the Ignore Other Applications setting is selected, Microsoft Excel
ignores DDE messages sent to it by other programs. As a result, the DDE
message sent to Microsoft Excel by Windows Explorer is ignored, and
Microsoft Excel does not open the workbook you double-clicked.
<P>
If you use Get External Data to retrieve data from an external database,
the macro that retrieves the data uses DDE to communicate with Microsoft
Query. However, when the macro is completed, it does not properly reset
DDE. Because of this, Microsoft Excel 97 does not accept any incoming DDE
messages until you quit and restart Microsoft Excel 97.
<P>
This prevents you from opening a Microsoft Excel workbook by double-
clicking it in Windows Explorer. It may also cause problems if other
programs attempt to send DDE messages to Microsoft Excel 97. In this case,
Microsoft recommends that you quit and restart Microsoft Excel 97.
