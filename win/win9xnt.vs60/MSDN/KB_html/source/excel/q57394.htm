The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, versions 1.x, 2.x, 3.0, 4.0

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
To import MORE II outlines into Microsoft Excel, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Make sure that the Plain Text filter is located in the System
   Folder.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Save As (to export the entire file) or
   Send To (to export the current selection).

<P><LI>Select the Plain Text filter and save the document. The document is
   converted to a tab-delimited text file, with each sublevel
   represented by one tab.

<P><LI>This file can then be opened into Excel.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Please note the following:

<OL><P><LI>MORE II saves text files with tabs delimiting each subheading. In
   Excel, each tab is treated as a separate column. The resulting
   spreadsheet will look basically like the outline did, with each
   subheading being indented successive columns to the right.

<P><LI>Labels present problems for Excel (they can be turned off by
   selecting No Labels from the Save As dialog box in MORE II). When
   labels are exported with the outline, Excel reads an extra tab in
   front of document text (a label is simply a special type of
   subheading in MORE II for dealing with long text. It is the
   equivalent of document text in a Word outline). Therefore, with
   labels, all document text is tabbed over one extra column when it
   is imported (in fact, it is tabbed over to the same column as the
   next level of subheadings). Without labels, the document text is
   imported in the same column as the subheading it is beneath. Note
   that this is local to a given subheading; that is, the subheadings
   with labels export the extra tab in front of their respective
   document text, and the opposite is true for any subheadings that do
   not have labels.
