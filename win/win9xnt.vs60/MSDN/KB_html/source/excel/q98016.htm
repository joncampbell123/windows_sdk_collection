The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 2.x, 3.0, 4.0, 4.0a, 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Excel does not support some character formatting such as
superscript and subscript (for example, there is no built-in character for
the squared symbol). However, if the character you want to use is contained
in the ANSI character set used by Microsoft Windows, you can place that
character in a cell by entering the character code in your document, or, if
you are using Microsoft Windows version 3.1, you can copy the symbol you
want from the Microsoft Windows Character Map.
<P>
Note: The ANSI character set is documented on page 568 of the "Microsoft
Windows User's Guide," version 3.0. If you do not have this particular
guide and are using Windows 3.1, see the "Using the Character Map" section
of this article.
<P>
Note: Microsoft Excel version 5.0 does support formatting of individual
characters. There are cases where you may want to use the ALT+&lt;code&gt; method
to enter characters. The information below is valid for version 5.0, but in
most cases, not necessary.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Entering the Character Code</h3>
 
<P>
There are two ways to enter an ANSI character code in a cell (with either
method, you can enter the character code by itself or you can enter it with
other text):

<UL><LI>Hold down the ALT key and type zero plus the code for the symbol
   you want to use. For example, to enter 10 degrees Celsius into a
   cell, type the following in one string (after you type 0176,
   release ALT key before you type the letter C):
<P>
<P><PRE>      10+ALT+0176+C
</PRE><P>
   Note that when you use this method, you must use the numeric
   keypad, not the number keys above the main keyboard, to enter the
   "0176".
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Use the CHAR() function in Microsoft Excel. For example, to enter 2
   squared into a cell, type the following formula:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ="2"&amp;CHAR(178)
</PRE><P>
</UL>Note that these entries will be entered as text. If you want the entry to
be treated as a value, for example, to add or average a series of
temperatures, you can create a custom number format.
<P>
To create custom number format for degrees Celsius, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Select the range of cells you want to format.

<P><LI>From the Format menu, choose Number.

<P><LI>In the Code box, type "0" (without the quotation marks), and hold
   down the ALT key and type 0176 followed by a C (after you type
   0176, release ALT key before you type the letter C):
<P>
<P><PRE>      0+ALT+0176+C
</PRE><P>
   Again, you must use the numeric keypad when typing the "0176".
<P>
</OL>When you enter a value into one of the selected cells, it will be followed
by a degree symbol and the letter C. Note that if you are using a custom
number format for an exponent such as 2 squared, the exponent portion is
treated as text and thereby ignored in any calculation. For example, 2
squared plus 2 squared will be calculated to equal 4 squared because only
the twos are added. The cell containing the sum takes its number format
from the cells being added resulting in the exponent of 2 being appended
onto the sum.
<P>
<P><h3>Using the Character Map (Windows Version 3.1 Only)</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft Windows version 3.1 includes a Character Map located in the
Accessories Group. You can select a symbol in the Character Map and copy
and paste it into a cell or dialog box such as the Format Number dialog
box.
<P>
For example, to place 10 degrees Celsius into a cell, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Run the Character Map.

<P><LI>In the Font list box, select System.

<P><LI>Choose the degree symbol (from the center of the fifth row).

<P><LI>Choose the Select button and choose the Copy button.

<P><LI>Activate Microsoft Excel. In a cell, type "10" (without the
   quotation marks).

<P><LI>From the Edit menu, choose Paste.

<P><LI>Type the letter C and press ENTER.
<P>
</OL>Note: If you want to create a custom number format that uses one of the
symbols, use the keyboard shortcut CTRL+V (copy), to copy the symbol to the
Format Number dialog box. The Edit menu will be unavailable while this
dialog box is active. For example, instead of typing ALT+0176 as described
in step 3 of the "To create a degrees Celsius format..." section of this
article, you would type CTRL+V to paste the symbol into the code box.
