<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Internal Rate of Return (IRR) method used by Excel can produce a
different solution for each change of sign in the cash flow. You must
try different guesses for the rate to find the most accurate solution.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following is an example:

<OL><P><LI>Type the following information onto a spreadsheet in Excel:
<P>
<PRE>      A1:    500
      A2:  -1100
      A3:    600

</PRE><P><LI>Type the following formula into cell A4 on the spreadsheet:
<P>
<P><PRE>      A4: =IRR(A1:A3,10%)
</PRE><P>
   The answer will be 20%.

<P><LI>Substitute 5% for the guess value in the IRR function in cell A4.
   The formula will look like:
<P>
<P><PRE>      A4: =IRR(A1:A3,5%)
</PRE><P>
   Now the answer is 0%.
<P>
</OL>Both of these answers are acceptable. It's up to you to decide which
one of these values you want to use. If you use the NPV function on
the same set of data and use both IRR values of 0% and 20% as the
rate, you will see that both result in a value of zero, which they
should.
<P>
They both result in zero values because that is the relationship
between IRR and NPV. The internal rate of return is the rate that sets
the net present value to zero.
<P>
When there are multiple IRRs, there's no good way to tell which result
makes more sense. For instance, in the example above, 20% makes sense
if the cash flows are annual but probably doesn't make sense if the
cash flows are monthly.
<P>
The outline below illustrates how many IRR values you should expect,
according to the number of cash flow sign changes that occur.

<OL><P><LI>If there is not a change of sign in your cash flow values, you will
   not get an answer.

<P><LI>If there is one change of sign in your cash flow data, you will get
   one answer. This is probably the norm, where it costs a certain
   amount of money to buy into the investment and then you receive
   money back over the next couple of years.

<P><LI>If there are multiple changes in the sign of your cash flow data,
   there can be multiple IRR values depending on your guess.
