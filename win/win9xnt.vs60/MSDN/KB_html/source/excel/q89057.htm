         card, or any video adapter supported by Microsoft Windows
         version 3.0, except CGA.

3. Q. What features are new to version 4.0 of Microsoft Excel for
      Windows?

   A. Microsoft Excel 4.0 gives you unprecedented power and ease of
      use. It enables you to have instant access to powerful features
      including unmatched analytical functions, outstanding reporting
      and presentation tools, and extensive easy charting. The new
      features of Microsoft Excel 4.0 are described in more detail
      below.

       - The Cell Drag And Drop option offers a fast and easy way
         to cut, copy, and paste data using the mouse. Just point to
         the data you want to move and drag it to its new position.

       - Shortcut menus pop up when you click the right mouse
         button. They provide instant access to common context-
         sensitive commands.

       - AutoFill recognizes trends and intelligently extends data
         and alphanumeric headings as far as you want.

       - AutoFormat applies an attractive, professionally designed
         format to your worksheet with one mouse click.

      Microsoft Excel 4.0 has the following powerful analysis tools
      customers asked for:

       - With Scenario Manager, you can easily create and save
         multiple "what if" scenarios and produce a summary of those
         scenarios.

       - The Analysis ToolPak includes the most extensive
         financial, statistical, engineering, and scientific functions
         of any spreadsheet, with over 160 functions in all.

      Microsoft Excel 4.0 also includes the following presentation and
      graphics tools:

       - The spelling checker is a built-in feature that makes all
         your presentations letter perfect.

       - With Report Manager, you can define different areas of one
         or more worksheets and print them as one report.

       - The gallery of 90 chart types has been enhanced to include
         rotating 3-D, surface, and radar charts.

       - Microsoft Excel 4.0 provides an easy transition from
         Lotus(R) 1-2-3(R) with the following features:

       - The Macro Interpreter for Lotus 1-2-3 users lets you run
         Lotus 1-2-3 macros unmodified (all release 2.01 and most
         release 2.2 and 2.3 macros).

       - Full file compatibility means that Microsoft Excel 4.0
         reads 19 different file formats, including WKS, WK1, WK3, and
         Impress.

4. Q. Does Microsoft provide any special programs for professional
      Excel developers?

   A. Microsoft will be releasing a software development kit (SDK) for
      version 4.0 of Microsoft Excel for Windows. You can obtain
      preliminary materials on the new Excel C application programming
      interface and the Microsoft Excel file formats, which will be
      part of this SDK, by calling Microsoft Developer Services at
      (800) 227-4679. Microsoft Developer Services is open from 6:30
      A.M. to 5:30 P.M. Pacific time.
