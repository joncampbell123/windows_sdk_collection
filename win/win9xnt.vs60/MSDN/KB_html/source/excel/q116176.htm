The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0c
<LI>Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, version 5.0, 5.0a

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you are using a workstation installation of Microsoft Excel, and you
choose the Add-ins command to add the ODBC add-in, you may receive any of
the following error messages.
<P>
<PRE>   Windows 3.x or Windows 95
   -------------------------

   File Error
   Cannot find XLODBC.DLL.

   -or-

   Attempt to register XLODBC.XLA failed.

   -or-

   Unable to copy add-in to library.

   Macintosh
   ---------

   Attempt to register XLODBC code resource failed.


</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs because the add-in manager places the XLODBC.XLA file
in a folder (directory) that is different from the folder where the
XLODBC.DLL is located. XLODBC.XLA is located in two places on your hard
disk, and the add-in manager is attempting to access the file from the
wrong location.
<P>
The XLODBC.XLA must be located in the same folder as the XLODBC.DLL file
for the add-in to work with ODBC functionality. The Add-in Manager is using
the copied XLODBC.XLA file located in the EXCEL\LIBRARY folder (the Macro
Library:MS Query folder on the Macintosh) and cannot find XLODBC.DLL (which
is located in the MSQUERY folder).
<P>
The Add-in Manager in Microsoft Excel does not recognize the MSQUERY
folder as an add-in folder. Therefore, when you select the ODBC
Add-in, the Microsoft Excel Add-in Manager attempts to copy the XLODBC.XLA
file to the wrong folder.
<P>
NOTE: The file XLODBC.DLL is replaced with the file XLODBC32.DLL in 
Micorsoft Excel 97.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, use the following appropriate procedure.
<P>
NOTE: Once you complete the appropriate workaround, you may want to change
the rights for the server that the workstation is accessing such that the
server is read-only. If the server is made read-only, the Add-in manager
will be unable to copy the XLODBC.XLA file to the incorrect location.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Excel for Windows</h3>
 
<P>
To work around this problem in Microsoft Excel for Windows, follow these 
steps:

<OL><P><LI>Delete the XLODBC.XLA file from the EXCEL\LIBRARY folder.
<P>
   NOTE: It is not necessary to delete any files in Microsoft Excel 97.

<P><LI>Click Add-ins from the Tools menu.

<P><LI>Click Browse, in the Add-ins dialog box, click the XLODBC.XLA file
   from EXCEL\LIBRARY\MSQUERY, and click OK.
<P>
   -or-
<P>
   In Microsoft Excel 97, click Browse and click XLODBC.XLA from 
   &lt;Office folder&gt;\OFFICE\LIBRARY\MSQUERY, and click OK.

<P><LI>Click NO when you receive the following message:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Copy XLODBC.XLA to Microsoft Excel Add-in Library?
</PRE><P>
   You do not want to copy the file. The proper location of XLODBC.XLA and
   XLODBC.DLL on the shared network location will be retained.

<P><LI>Confirm the proper reference of the XLODBC.XLA Add-in in your
   EXCEL5.INI for Microsoft Excel 5.0, located in the Windows folder on
   your local workstation. If the Add-in reference still points to 
   EXCEL\LIBRARY, change this line to EXCEL\LIBRARY\MSQUERY, and save the 
   EXCEL5.INI file.
<P>
   NOTE: Make this change after you quit Microsoft Excel.
<P>
</OL><h3>Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh</h3>
 
<P>
To work around this problem in Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, follow 
these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Delete the XLODBC.XLA file from the Microsoft Excel 5:Macro Library
   folder.

<P><LI>From the Tools menu, choose Add-ins.

<P><LI>In the Add-ins dialog box, choose Browse, select the XLODBC.XLA file
   from the Microsoft Excel 5:Macro Library:MS Query folder, and
   choose OK.

<P><LI>Choose No when you receive the following message:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Copy XLODBC.XLA to Microsoft Excel Add-in Library?
</PRE><P>
   You do not want to copy the file. The proper location of XLODBC.XLA
   (Microsoft Excel 5:Macro Library:MSQuery) will be retained.
<P>
</OL>If you continue to have trouble using the ODBC add-in commands, quit
Microsoft Excel and drag the Excel Settings (5) file from the Preferences
folder to the Trash. Restart Microsoft Excel, and then repeat steps 1-4.
Note that if you do this, all your custom settings will be reset to the
default settings.
