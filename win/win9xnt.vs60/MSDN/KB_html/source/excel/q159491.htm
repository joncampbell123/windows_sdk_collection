The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 3.0, 4.0, 4.0a, 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh versions 3.0, 4.0, 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Excel for OS/2, version 3.0
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0
<LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you type a number in a cell, Microsoft Excel may automatically apply a
built-in number format to the cell based on the characteristics of the
number.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Excel automatically applies a built-in number format to a cell
based on the following criteria:

<UL><LI>If a number contains a slash (/) or hyphen (-), it may be converted
   to a date format.

<LI>If a number contains a colon (:), or is followed by a space and the
   letter A or P, it may be converted to a time format.

<LI>If a number contains the letter E (in uppercase or lowercase
   letters, for example 10e5), it may be converted to scientific
   notation, or exponential, format.

<LI>If a number contains leading zeros, the leading zeros will be
   dropped.
<P>
</UL><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Avoiding Automatic Number Formatting</h3>
 
<P>
If you want to type a value such as 10e5, 1 p, or 1-2, and you do not
want the value to be converted to a built-in number format, type the
number as a text value. To type a number as a text value, follow the
appropriate procedure below.
<P>
All Versions of Microsoft Excel:
<P>
Place a space at the beginning of the entry (or press OPTION+SPACEBAR if
you are using Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh).
<P>
NOTE: This method does not work if the entry resembles a number formatted
in scientific notation. For example, typing " 1e9" (without the quotation
marks) results in a scientific number.
<P>
Microsoft Excel 5.0 and Later:
<P>
Select a range of cells, click Cells on the Format menu, and then click the
Number Tab. Click Text, and then click OK. This method allows you to type
data in the selected cells as text. You must perform these steps before you
type the numbers in the cells.
<P>
Microsoft Excel 4.0 and Later:
<P>
Precede the entry with an apostrophe. For example, type the following:
<P>
<PRE>      '1 p

</PRE>Microsoft Excel 3.0 and Earlier:
<P>
Enclose the entry in quotation marks and precede the value with an  equal
sign. For example, type the following:
<P>
<PRE>      ="1 p"

</PRE><h3>Typing a Fraction</h3>
 
<P>
To type a fraction, such as 1/2, such that it is not converted to a date
value, type the fraction in the form XX YY/ZZ, where XX is the integer
component of the fraction, YY is the numerator, and ZZ is the denominator.
To do this, use the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Select the cell in which you want to type the fraction.

<P><LI>Type the fraction in the form XX YY/ZZ. For example, type the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      6 7/8.
</PRE><P>
</OL>The cell displays the fraction, but the formula bar displays the true value
of the fraction (in this case, 6.875).
<P>
To type the fraction 1/2, type 0 1/2. If you omit 0 (zero), Microsoft Excel
converts the fraction to a date.
<P>
NOTE: After Microsoft Excel converts a fraction to a date, its underlying
value is changed. As a result, if you import a text file or parse text, you
must precede these entries with a text character before you import or parse
the file (as described below in the note under "Maintaining Number Formats
When You Import Text Files or Use Parse").
<P>
<P><h3>Typing a Value with Leading Zeros</h3>
 
<P>
Because leading zeros are insignificant digits, Microsoft Excel omits them
when you type a number, such as 00023, in a cell. In this case, Microsoft
Excel applies the General number format.
<P>
To type a value with a leading zero, you can use one of the methods
described in the previous section to type the value as text, or you can use
the following appropriate steps to create a custom number format that
contains leading zeros:
<P>
Microsoft Excel 5.0 and Later:

<OL><P><LI>Select the cell range you want to format.

<P><LI>On the Format menu, click Cells. On the Number tab, click Custom.

<P><LI>In the Type box (Code box in version 5.0), type a zero for each digit in
   the number. For example, if the number has five digits, type five zeros.

<P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
</OL>If you import a text file or parse text, you can use this procedure after
you import or parse the text. You don't need to preformat the entries as
text (as described in the following section). However, you must preformat
numbers that are evaluated as dates, times, or scientific notation.
<P>
Microsoft Excel 3.0 and 4.0:

<OL><P><LI>Select the cell range you want to format.

<P><LI>On the Format menu, click Number.

<P><LI>In the Code box (Format box in version 3.0), type a zero for each digit
   in your number.
<P>
   For example, if your number has five digits, type five zeros.

<P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
</OL><h3>Retaining Number Formats When You Import Text Files or Use Parse</h3>
 
<P>
When you import a text file into Microsoft Excel or use the Parse (located
on the Data menu in Microsoft version 4.0) or the Text To Columns command
(located on the Data menu in Microsoft Excel 5.0, 7.0, 97 and 98) to place
text entries in separate columns, Microsoft Excel applies number formats to
the data if the file contains entries similar to those mentioned in this
article.
<P>
NOTE: The following Application Note applies to Microsoft Excel 4.0. Some
information in the document is not relevant to later versions of Microsoft
Excel. For example, the Parse command on the Data menu in Microsoft Excel
4.0 is replaced by the Text To Columns command, which is also located on
the Data menu.
<P>
A Microsoft Application Note about text importing is also available. For
information about what this Application Note discusses and how you can
obtain it, see the following articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../excel/q102142.htm">Q102142</A></B>
   TITLE     : "Excel AppNote: Opening and Saving Text Files (ME0802)"

   This Application Note is for Microsoft Excel version 4.0 for the
   Macintosh.

   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../excel/q99844.htm">Q99844</A></B>
   TITLE     : "Excel AppNote: Opening and Saving Text Files (WE0801)"

   This Application Note is for Microsoft Excel version 4.0 for
   Windows.

</PRE></OL>NOTE: If you are importing a text file or parsing text, and you do not have
the Application Note, "Opening and Saving Text Files," you must open the
file in a text editor and precede the entries with the appropriate text
character for your version of Microsoft Excel. When you open the file in
Microsoft Excel version 4.0 and later, these entries are treated as text.
<P>

This behavior is by design of Microsoft Excel.
