<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you crop a picture in Microsoft Excel 97, the size of the area that
you cropped from the picture differs from the size of the area you
specified in the Format Picture dialog box. For example, if you crop a
picture from the left by one inch, the picture may be cropped by two
inches.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may occur if you scale a picture so that the height or width
of the picture is a value other than 100 percent and you then crop the
picture.
<P>
Specifically, this problem occurs because Microsoft Excel 97 crops the
picture before it scales the picture.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, divide the amount by which you want to crop
the picture by the amount by which you scaled the picture, and then enter
this value in the Format Picture dialog box. For example, if you want to
crop 2.5 inches from the left side of a picture with a width that you
scaled to 200 percent (or 2), enter 1.25 in the Left box. To determine this
number, divide 2.5 inches by 2 inches.
<P>
To crop 1.5 inches from the top of a picture with a height that you scaled
to 50 percent (or 0.5), enter 3 in the Top box (1.5 divided by 0.5 is 3
inches).
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you insert a picture into a worksheet or chart in Microsoft Excel 97,
you can change the appearance of the picture by clicking the picture and
clicking Picture on the Format menu.
<P>
You can change the scale of the selected picture by clicking the Size tab,
and then changing the values in the Height or Width boxes. Using a value
larger than 100 percent causes the picture to increase in size; using a
value smaller than 100 percent causes the picture to decrease in size.
<P>
You can also crop, or trim, a picture by clicking the Picture tab, and then
changing the values in the Left, Right, Top, or Bottom boxes.
<P>
When you crop a picture that is also scaled, Microsoft Excel crops the
picture before scaling the picture. For example, if you create a picture
that is 5 inches wide, scale the width of the picture to 200 percent, and
then crop 1 inch from the left side of the picture, the result is a picture
with a width of 8 inches. When you do this, Microsoft Excel uses the
following calculation to determine the width of the picture:
<P>
<PRE>   (5 - 1) * 200 = 8

</PRE>The result is not a picture with a width of 9 inches as in the following
calculation:
<P>
<PRE>   (5 * 200) - 1 = 9

</PRE>You can determine the size of a picture by clicking the Size tab in the
Format Picture dialog box. The original size appears near the bottom of the
dialog box.
