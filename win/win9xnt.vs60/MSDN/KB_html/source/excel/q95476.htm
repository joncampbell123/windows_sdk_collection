The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 3.0, 4.0, 4.0a
</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, if you are working with a document that contains
cells that were formatted by pressing ALT+ENTER, and you print this
document to a Hewlett Packard 4/4M printer using the version 31.1.03
HP LaserJet 4/4M printer driver (HPPCL5E.DRV), print preview may not
accurately represent what is printed.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, you can generate multiple lines in a cell by
pressing ALT+ENTER. If these cells are not formatted with a wrap-text
alignment, the text will appear to be all on one line, with each
ALT+ENTER combination replaced by two nonprintable character marks.
When your printer is configured to print using the Hewlett Packard
4/4M driver, the ALT+ENTER character codes are interpreted by the
printer and the data will be printed on multiple lines. However, print
preview displays the information in the cell as it appears on the
worksheet, not as it appears in the printed document.
<P>
<P><h3>Workaround</h3>
 

<UL><LI>Format the cell(s) with a wrap-text alignment. This can be used with
   or instead of the ALT+ENTER keys.
<P>
</UL>Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information
here as it becomes available.
<P>
The LaserJet 4/4M is manufactured by Hewlett-Packard, a vendor
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise,
regarding this product's performance or reliability.
