The information in this article applies to:
<P>
<PRE>  - Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, versions 2.2, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0
</PRE> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
It is not possible to change the capitalization of the name of an
Excel document with only one use of the Save As command, which is
located under the File menu. It is also not possible to save a new
copy with the same letters, but with differing case, into the same
folder.
<P>
Specific combinations of upper and lower case letters in a file name
are determined the first time an Excel document is saved. After the
initial save, file commands executed from within Excel cease to be
case-sensitive for that document. Excel retains the original case
information of the file name, regardless of the combination of upper
and lower case letters in the name.
<P>
The easiest way to change the case of an Excel file name is to edit
the name of the document from the Finder.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In order to change the case of an Excel document name from within the
application, use the following procedure:

<OL><P><LI>Save the file using a different name by choosing Save As from the
   File menu and editing the name.

<P><LI>Delete the original document from the current folder by choosing
   Delete from the File menu.

<P><LI>Rename the document with its new capitalization by choosing Save As
   from  the File menu.

<P><LI>Delete the copy with the different name by choosing Delete from the
   file menu.
