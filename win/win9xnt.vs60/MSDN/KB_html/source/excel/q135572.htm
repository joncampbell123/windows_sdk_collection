The information in this article applies to:

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, when you save a shared file, the information that
appears in the "Your Changes" box or the "Conflicting Changes" box in the
Conflict Resolution dialog box may be incomplete.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When you save a shared file, the Conflict Resolution dialog box appears if
another user has saved changes to the same file that conflict with the
changes you have made. This dialog box displays both the change you made,
and the conflicting change, and allows you to select which change you want
to keep in the file. However, when you make a change to a cell in a shared
file that conflicts with a change that another user has saved to the same
file, the information displayed in the Conflict Resolution dialog box is
incomplete if the conflicting cell contains close to the maximum number of
characters allowed in a cell (256).
<P>
For example, if you enter 256 characters in a cell in a shared file, and
your change to this cell conflicts with the change that another user made
to the same cell, when you save the file, the "Your Changes" box in the
Conflict Resolution dialog box does not display the entire contents of the
cell. Additionally, there is no indication that the text displayed in the
"Your Changes" box is not the complete text in the cell. For example, there
is no ellipses character following the last character in the box.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
