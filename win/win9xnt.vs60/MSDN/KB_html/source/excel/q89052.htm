1. Q. I am switching from Lotus 1-2-3 to version 4.0 of Microsoft
      Excel for Windows. I have a number of macros that were created
      in Lotus 1-2-3. Can Microsoft Excel 4.0 run my existing Lotus
      1-2-3 macros without modification?

   A. Microsoft Excel 4.0 includes the Macro Interpreter for Lotus
      1-2-3 users. This new feature allows you to open your Lotus
      1-2-3 worksheets and run any macros on those worksheets without
      modification or translation. Microsoft Excel 4.0 supports only
      Lotus 1-2-3 macros containing functions, commands, and advanced
      macro commands that are supported by Lotus 1-2-3 release 2.01.

      To run a Lotus 1-2-3 macro in Microsoft Excel 4.0:

      1. Open your Lotus 1-2-3 worksheet in Microsoft Excel by
         choosing Open from the File menu.

      2. In the File Name box, type the name of your Lotus 1-2-3
         worksheet, then choose the OK button.

      3. After you open the worksheet, press the CTRL key and the
         letter of the macro name.

      If you are unsure what letter represents the Lotus 1-2-3 macro
      name, you can find this information by choosing Define Name from
      the Formula menu. The range names for macros created in Lotus
      1-2-3 are listed in the Names In Sheet box. Lotus 1-2-3 macro
      names start with the backslash character (\), which is followed
      by the letter of the macro name.

      For more information, please refer to pages 26-29 of the
      "Switching to Microsoft Excel from Lotus 1-2-3" guide.

2. Q. I am switching from Lotus 1-2-3 to version 4.0 of Microsoft
      Excel for Windows. I want to use the macros I created in Lotus
      1-2-3 in Microsoft Excel. Are there any limitations to Microsoft
      Excel's ability to run Lotus 1-2-3 macros?

   A. Although Microsoft Excel 4.0 recognizes all Lotus 1-2-3 file
      formats, Microsoft Excel fully supports only Lotus 1-2-3 macros
      that contain functions, commands, and advanced macro commands
      supported by Lotus 1-2-3 release 2.01. However, many Lotus 1-2-3
      release 2.2 and 2.3 macros do run in Excel. Please refer to the
      "Switching to Microsoft Excel from Lotus 1-2-3" guide for a
      compete list of release 2.2 and 2.3 macros supported by
      Microsoft Excel.

      A second limitation is that Microsoft Excel runs only existing
      Lotus 1-2-3 macros. You cannot create new Lotus 1-2-3 macros in
      Microsoft Excel, nor can you call Lotus 1-2-3 macros from macros
      created by Microsoft Excel.

      For more information, please refer to pages 26-27 of the
      "Switching to Microsoft Excel from Lotus 1-2-3" guide.

3. Q. I am trying to run my Lotus 1-2-3 macros in version 4.0 of
      Microsoft Excel for Windows. When I run a macro, I receive an
      alert message that tells me there is a macro error in a certain
      cell. When I choose the OK button in the message box, a second
      alert, "Cannot End Macro in a Menu," is displayed. How can I
      avoid these error messages?

   A. Lotus 1-2-3 macros in Microsoft Excel are not allowed to end
      with a menu having the focus. For example, in Lotus 1-2-3, the
      macro /pp normally leaves the focus in the Print Settings menu,
      rather than in ready mode.

      To correct such situations, edit the Lotus 1-2-3 macro to either
      exclude the macro that causes the problem or exit the menu. For
      the /pp macro, placing the letter "q" at the end of the command,
      so that it reads "/ppq" (without the quotation marks), causes
      the macro to exit the Print Settings menu.

      For more information, please refer to page 28 of the Switching
      to "Microsoft Excel from Lotus 1-2-3" guide.
