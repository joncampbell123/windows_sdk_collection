<PRE>1. Q. Why can't I run Microsoft Excel version 5.0 for Windows NT(TM)
      and Microsoft Excel for Windows 95 on the same computer?

   A. Due to internal differences in the 32-bit Visual Basic(R) for
      Applications library files needed to run these two versions of
      Microsoft Excel, it is not possible for both versions of
      Microsoft Excel to reside on the same computer. For more
      information about this issue, please order item number <B><A href="../excel/q131299.htm">Q131299</A></B>
      from the FastTips Catalog.

2. Q. Why do files that I created in Microsoft Excel version 5.0
      increase in size by 4-6K when I open them in Microsoft Excel
      for Windows 95? This happens even if I add no additional
      information to the file.

   A. This behavior occurs in part because Microsoft Excel for
      Windows 95 has been optimized to save files faster than
      Microsoft Excel version 5.0. Note, also, that when you create
      and save a file in Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, the file is
      not necessarily larger than the equivalent file that you create
      and save in Microsoft Excel version 5.0. For more information
      about this issue, please order item number <B><A href="../excel/q132454.htm">Q132454</A></B> from the
      FastTips Catalog.

3. Q. When I try to use zip codes to create a map object in Microsoft
      Data Map, I receive an error message. Why is this happening?

   A. When you create a map object based on zip codes, you must
      format the zip codes with the special Zip Code number format.
      For more information about formatting cells with the Zip Code
      format, please order item number <B><A href="../excel/q131929.htm">Q131929</A></B> from the FastTips
      Catalog.

4. Q. In versions of Microsoft Excel earlier than version 7.0, when I
      type a value with a percent sign or format a value with a
      Percentage number format, the value is displayed in the formula
      bar in decimal format. However, in Microsoft Excel for Windows
      95, when I type a value with a percent sign, the value in the
      formula bar is displayed with the percent sign. Why does this
      happen?

   A. This new behavior makes it easier for you to enter a new value
      in a cell that is formatted with the Percentage number format.
      For example, in earlier versions of Microsoft Excel, when you
      enter the value 0.41 on your worksheet and format the cell with
      the Percentage number format, the value is displayed as 41%. If
      you then enter the value 56 in that same cell, the value is
      displayed as 5600%, instead of 56% as you may have intended.
      For more information about this issue, order item number
      <B><A href="../excel/q129253.htm">Q129253</A></B> from the FastTips Catalog.

5. Q. Why are my Microsoft Excel documents being saved in the "My
      Documents" folder?

   A. By default, all Microsoft Office applications are saved in the
      "My Documents" folder. To change the default directory for
      Microsoft Excel, use the following three steps:

      1. In Microsoft Excel, on the Tools menu, click Options.

      2. Click the General tab.

      3. In the Default File Location box, type the path to the new
         default directory.
