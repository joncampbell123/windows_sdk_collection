<P><h2>INTRODUCTION--EXPLANATION OF THE 15-DIGIT NUMBER PROBLEM</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel version 5.0c, the values of certain 15-digit
numbers may unexpectedly change when they are entered in a worksheet
cell or when they are calculated by a formula in a worksheet cell. The
three numbers are:
<P>
<PRE>   140737488355328
   281474976710656
   562949953421312

</PRE>Note that these numbers are 2 to the 47th, 48th, or 49th power,
respectively.
<P>
If you enter a variation of these numbers (for example,
1.40737488355328), or if you calculate a variation of one of these
numbers, the number may be resolved to a different value, such as 0.64
(or some multiple of 0.64). The problem also appears when one of these
numbers is the result of one of the following functions: CEILING(),
FLOOR(), IF(), INT(), MOD(), ROUNDDOWN(), or ROUNDUP().
<P>
This problem applies only to these particular numbers. Other 15-digit
numbers are not affected.
<P>
This problem also occurs in other versions of Microsoft Excel for
Windows; however, patches are available only for Microsoft Excel
version 5.0c for Windows and Microsoft Excel version 7.0 for Windows
95. For information about how to patch your version of Microsoft
Excel, see the following table.
<P>
NOTE: You must use the appropriate patch for your version of
Microsoft Excel. The patch for version 5.0c cannot be used to update
Microsoft Excel version 7.0 for Windows 95 and vice versa.
<P>
<PRE>  For this version of
  Microsoft Excel      Do this
  -----------------------------------------------------------

  Microsoft Excel      Upgrade to Microsoft Excel version
  Earlier than 5.0c    5.0c. To do this, call Microsoft Order
  for Windows          Desk at (800) 360-7561 and tell them
                       that you need to upgrade to Microsoft
                       Excel version 5.0c in order to use the
                       15-digit number patch. Then, use the
                       patch provided with this Application
                       Note.

  Version 5.0c for     Use the patch provided with this
  Windows              Application Note.

  Version 7.0 for      Obtain the 15-digit number patch for
  Windows 95           Microsoft Excel version 7.0
                       (XL15link.exe). For more information
                       about obtaining XL15link.exe, please
                       see the following article in the
                       Microsoft Knowledge Base:

                       Article-ID: <B><A href="../excel/q128650.htm">Q128650</A></B>

                       Title: XL7 Patch Available: 15-Digit
                       Number, Linking, and Transpose

</PRE><h2>CORRECTING THE PROBLEM IN VERSION 5.0c</h2>
 
<P>
The patch file included with this Application Note is for use only
with Microsoft Excel version 5.0c. This patch modifies Microsoft Excel
so that it no longer changes the three previously mentioned numbers.
After you patch Microsoft Excel, you can safely use any of the three
numbers in a new worksheet, and their values will be retained.
<P>
<P><h3>To install the patch</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>If you received a disk with this Application Note, insert the
   WE1254 disk in the appropriate floppy disk drive.
<P>
   If you downloaded this Application Note from an online service,
   skip to step 2. This procedure assumes that you have already
   downloaded and extracted the compressed file.

<P><LI>At the MS-DOS prompt, type the following and press ENTER
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy &lt;source&gt;:\*.* &lt;location&gt;
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;source&gt; is either the letter of your floppy disk drive or
   the folder (directory) containing the file you downloaded from
   online services, and &lt;location&gt; is the path to your Microsoft Excel
   folder. For example, if you are copying the file from a floppy disk
   that you inserted in drive A, and C:\Excel is the path to your
   Microsoft Excel folder, type:
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy a:\*.* c:\excel
</PRE><P>
   Or, for example, if you downloaded the We1254.exe file from online
   services to C:\Dnload, and C:\Excel is the path to your Microsoft
   Excel folder, type:
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy c:\dnload\*.* c:\excel
</PRE><P>
   The following files are copied to your Microsoft Excel folder:
<P>
<PRE>      Clean.bat     Update.lst
      Readme.txt    Xl5.cst
      Update.exe    Xl5_exe.pch

</PRE></OL><h3>To run the patch</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>If Microsoft Excel is running, quit Microsoft Excel.

<P><LI>Using File Manager or Windows Explorer, double-click the Update.exe
   file in your Microsoft Excel folder.
<P>
   A message appears when the file has completed modifying Microsoft
   Excel.

<P><LI>Double-click the Clean.bat file.
<P>
   This patches the Excel.exe file, and removes five of the six files
   you just copied, leaving you with the Readme.txt file.
<P>
</OL><h3>To correct calculations on an existing worksheet once the patch is</h3>
 
<P><h3>installed</h3>
 
<P>
If you have a worksheet that you think may contain one of the numbers
listed earlier in this Application Note, you can display the correct
numbers by pressing CTRL+ALT+F9. This key command forces the entire
worksheet to be recalculated.
