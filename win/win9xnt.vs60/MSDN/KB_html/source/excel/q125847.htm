<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, version 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, version 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, custom toolbars can be attached to workbooks to allow
the toolbar to be stored in the document, and these toolbars can be made
available when the document is opened. However, the attached toolbar may
not appear as expected when either of the following conditions is true:

<UL><LI>The attached toolbar is not loaded
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE>
<LI>The attached toolbar reverts to a previous version
<P>
</UL>For more information about these conditions, see the appropriate section in
the "More Information" section of this article.
<P>
To ensure that an attached toolbar is updated when the toolbar is modified,
you must choose Attach Toolbars from the Tools menu and re-copy the toolbar
to the worksheet each time you modify the toolbar.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Attached Toolbar Is Not Loaded</h3>
 
<P>
If a custom toolbar attached to a workbook has the same name as an existing
custom toolbar in the current Microsoft Excel session, the attached toolbar
will not replace the existing toolbar when the workbook is opened. Any
Visual Basic macro code that references the attached toolbar will instead
reference the pre-existing toolbar. For example, if a currently running
Microsoft Excel session has an existing toolbar named "My Toolbar," and you
open a file that has an attached toolbar also named "My Toolbar," Microsoft
Excel will not load "My Toolbar" from the file. If a Visual Basic macro
subsequently issues the command
<P>
<PRE>   Toolbars("My Toolbar").Visible=True

</PRE>the pre-existing toolbar in the Microsoft Excel session will be displayed
rather than the recently attached toolbar.
<P>
<P><h3>Attached Toolbar Reverts to Previous Version</h3>
 
<P>
If you attach a custom toolbar to a workbook, modify it, and then save the
workbook, the attached toolbar will not reflect any changes made after the
toolbar has been attached. You will not notice this behavior until you open
the workbook on a different computer. For example, you will notice this
problem if you do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Create a custom toolbar named "My Toolbar" that has two buttons.

<P><LI>Attach this toolbar to a workbook, and add a third button to it.

<P><LI>Save and close the workbook.
<P>
</OL>If you do not delete "My Toolbar" in the current session of Microsoft
Excel, and if you reopen the file, the attached toolbar will not be loaded
and three buttons will be seen on "My Toolbar." However, if you open the
workbook in a different installation of Microsoft Excel (on another
computer, for example) that does not contain a custom toolbar named "My
Toolbar," the attached toolbar will be loaded, and "My Toolbar" will
display the two buttons that were present at the time it was attached to
the worksheet.
