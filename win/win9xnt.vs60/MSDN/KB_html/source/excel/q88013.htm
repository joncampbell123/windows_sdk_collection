1. Q. Excel keeps generating the error message "Can't change part of
      an array." Why is this happening?

   A. The cell or range of cells you are trying to modify is part of
      an array formula. Microsoft Excel version 3.0 for the Macintosh
      treats array formulas as single units; therefore, you cannot
      change a part of an array, nor can you sort part of an array
      using the Data Sort command.

      To cancel the error message, first choose the OK button, then
      either press ESC or press COMMAND+PERIOD to cancel the current
      action. If you want to convert the array formula to just the
      values so that the values can be edited, use the following five-
      step procedure (you must be in full menu mode to perform this
      procedure):

      Step 1. Select the entire array by pressing COMMAND+SHIFT while
      double-clicking any cell of the array.

      Step 2. From the Edit menu, choose Copy.

      Step 3. From the Edit menu, choose Paste Special.

      Step 4. Under Paste, select the Values option button.

      Step 5. Choose the OK button. This replaces the array formulas
      with the values they returned. Any cell in the array can now be
      changed as necessary.

      For more information on converting arrays into constant values,
      please refer to page 273 of the "Microsoft Excel User's Guide"
      for version 3.0.

2. Q. I have just purchased a new Macintosh Quadra, and Microsoft
      Excel version 3.0 for the Macintosh doesn't seem to be working
      correctly. What is wrong?

   A. The processor in the new Macintosh Quadra conflicts with many
      earlier versions of software.

      A maintenance release of Microsoft Excel 3.0 for the Macintosh
      is available for full compatibility with the Quadra. However,
      companion applications, such as the Dialog Editor, Excel Solver,
      and the Data Access Macro, have not been upgraded for Quadra
      compatibility. For these companion applications to be fully
      compatible, you must upgrade to Microsoft Excel version 4.0 for
      the Macintosh. To order Microsoft Excel 4.0 for the Macintosh,
      please call Microsoft Consumer Sales at (800) 426-9400. To
      receive the free upgrade to Microsoft Excel version 3.0 for the
      Macintosh, please leave your name, company name, address, city,
      state, zip, and a daytime phone number at the beep. We regret
      that we are unable to ship to a post office box.

      For more information on software compatibility with the
      Macintosh Quadra family of computers, please consult the
      README.DOC file on your Quadra.

3. Q. What is the proper procedure to transfer files between Microsoft
      Excel version 3.0 for Windows and Microsoft Excel 3.0 for the
      Macintosh?

   A. Transferring files between Microsoft Excel 3.0 for the Macintosh
      and Microsoft Excel 3.0 for Windows is an easy process because
      both programs share the same file format and will retain all
      formatting and formula information.

      To import an Excel for Windows file, perform the next four
      steps:

      Step 1. Save the Excel for Windows file in Normal format.

      Step 2. Use a communications, network, or file exchange utility
      with binary transfer capability (such as Microsoft Works's
      communication module, Microsoft LAN Manager, or Apple File
      Exchange) to bring the file over to the Macintosh.

      Step 3. Next, launch Microsoft Excel 3.0 for the Macintosh. From
      the File menu, choose Open.

      Step 4. Navigate to the appropriate folder and select the file,
      then click the Open button. Once you save the file, the proper
      icon appears.

      To export a file to Excel for Windows, perform the next four
      steps:

      Step 1. Save the Excel for the Macintosh file in the Normal
      format.

      Step 2. Use a communications, network, or file exchange utility
      with binary transfer capability (such as Microsoft Works's
      communication module, Microsoft LAN Manager, or Apple File
      Exchange) to bring the file over to the Macintosh.

      Step 3. Next, launch Excel for Windows. From the File menu,
      choose Open.

      Step 4. Switch to the appropriate directory and select the file,
      then choose the OK button.

      For more information on Apple File Exchange, please refer to
      your Macintosh user's manuals.

4. Q. I am using numbers on my worksheet that contain a leading zero.
      How can I format the numbers so that Microsoft Excel version 3.0
      for the Macintosh displays the leading zero?

   A. To display leading zeros in Microsoft Excel 3.0 for the
      Macintosh, you must create a custom number format. To do this,
      perform the next three steps:

      Step 1. Select the cells you want to format. From the Format
      menu, choose Number.

      Step 2. In the Format box, type as many zeros as you need to
      serve as placeholders.

      Step 3. Choose the OK button; the number format is applied to
      the selected cells.

      For example, if you want to see the number "01234" in cell A1,
      the number format for that cell should be "00000" or five zeros.

      For more information on creating custom number formats, please
      refer to pages 180-185 of the "Microsoft Excel User's Guide" for
      version 3.0.

5. Q. Microsoft Excel version 3.0 for the Macintosh doesn't seem to be
      sorting my data correctly. What could be wrong?

   A. Microsoft Excel 3.0 for the Macintosh allows you to sort data
      either across rows or down columns. When you sort information
      with headings in the first row, be careful not to include the
      headings as part of the information you sort.

      To sort data either alphabetically or numerically in Excel,
      perform the following four steps:

      Step 1. Select the range of cells you want to sort.

      Step 2. From the Data menu, choose Sort. To sort rows, keeping
      the rows intact, select the Rows option button. To sort columns,
      keeping the columns intact, select the Columns option button.

      Step 3. In the 1st Key box, either enter the reference of the
      column to sort by when sorting rows or enter the reference of
      the row to sort by when sorting columns. To sort based upon more
      than one key, enter the appropriate references in the 2nd Key
      and 3rd Key boxes. Remember to select Ascending or Descending
      for each sort key specified.

      Step 4. Choose the OK button to sort the data.

      Remember to sort only text, numbers, or formulas with ABSOLUTE
      references.

      For more information on sorting, please refer to pages 352-355
      of the "Microsoft Excel User's Guide" for version 3.0.
