The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you click any of the tools on the Drawing toolbar while recording an
AppleScript script, the results of clicking the tools are not recorded into
the script.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs because the drawing system in Microsoft Excel 98
Macintosh Edition does not support AppleScript.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft provides programming examples for illustration only, without
warranty either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the
implied warranties of merchantability and/or fitness for a particular
purpose. This article assumes that you are familiar with the programming
language being demonstrated and the tools used to create and debug
procedures. Microsoft support engineers can help explain the functionality
of a particular procedure, but they will not modify these examples to
provide added functionality or construct procedures to meet your specific
needs. If you have limited programming experience, you may want to contact
the Microsoft fee-based consulting line at (800) 936-5200. For more
information about the support options available from Microsoft, please see
the following page on the World Wide Web:
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/support/supportnet/refguide/default.asp">http://www.microsoft.com/support/supportnet/refguide/default.asp</A></B>

</PRE>AppleScript is manufactured by Apple Computer, Inc., a vendor independent 
of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this 
product's performance or reliability. 
<P>
If you need an AppleScript script to be able to insert a drawing object
into a worksheet or chart, record or write a Microsoft Visual Basic for
Applications macro that performs the required actions. Then, while you are
recording the script, run the macro in Microsoft Excel. The command to run
the macro will be correctly recorded into the script.
<P>
For example, if the macro in Microsoft Excel resembles the following:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub InsertRectangle()
      ActiveSheet.Shapes.AddShape(msoShapeRectangle, 103#, 80#, _
         114#, 66#).Select
   End Sub

</PRE>and is contained in Workbook1, the recorded script should resemble the
following:
<P>
<PRE>   tell application "Microsoft Excel"
      activate
      Evaluate "Workbook1!InsertRectangle()"
   end tell

</PRE>You can use other Visual Basic macros to perform other drawing-related
actions, such as moving drawing objects.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
You can use the AppleScript Script Editor to record scripts that interact
with many programs, including Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh. When you
record such a script, every action you perform in Microsoft Excel is
recorded into the script. You can then run the script, and Microsoft Excel
performs the recorded actions.
<P>
The exception to this rule involves the drawing tools in Microsoft Excel 98
Macintosh Edition. Because of the design of the drawing system, it does not
respond at all to AppleScript scripts. It is not possible to modify an
existing script to use the drawing tools, unless you use the workaround
shown above.
