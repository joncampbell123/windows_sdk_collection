<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you create a chart as a new sheet in Microsoft Excel 97, the chart
appears similar to how it will view in print preview. This view shows
how the layout of your chart and all of its elements will look when you
print it. In this view, you can size, move, and format the plot area (the
region bounded by the axes) and chart items, such as graphic objects,
titles, text boxes, and the legend.
<P>
This article discusses how options in Page Setup affect what you can move
and size in this view and how to change the view so that the chart fills
the window.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Changing What You Can Move and Size in Chart Window (Page Setup Options)</h3>
 
<P>
The way the chart window appears on your screen and when you print it
depends on how you set various options in the Page Setup dialog box (these
options include paper size, orientation, and margin size). For example, if
the page orientation is set to Landscape, the window appears wider than it
is tall.
<P>
The option you select under Printed Chart Size on the Chart tab in the Page
Setup dialog box affects how you can move and size the chart area, plot
area, and the chart elements. When you select the Full Page option, you can
size and move the plot area but not the chart area. When you select the
Scale To Fit Page or Custom options, you can size both the plot area and
the chart area. With either of these options selected, chart elements, such
as titles, text boxes, and arrows, will move relative to the chart area.
<P>
The following table lists the Printed Chart Size options that are located
on the Chart tab, how they affect the way the chart is displayed and
printed, and how they affect what you can move and size.
<P>

</PRE><h3>Changing View So Chart Fills Window</h3>
 
<P>

the chart in its full size on your screen, do either of the following:

<UL><LI>On the View menu click Zoom, select 100% under Magnification,
   and then click OK.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE>
<LI>Select 100% in the Zoom box on the Standard toolbar.
<P>
</UL>To display the chart as it would appear in Microsoft Excel 4.0 (that is,
with its size determined by the size of the window), click Sized With
Window on the View menu, or follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Options.

<P><LI>Click the Chart tab, and then click to select the "Size with Window
   Frame" check box.
<P>

option will be selected by default. To display the chart in page layout,
clear this option.
