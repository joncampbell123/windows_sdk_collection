The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 4.0, 4.0a, 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, versions 4.0, 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, you can double-click any border of the active cell to
move the selection. When you press SHIFT and double-click any border in the
cell, you extend the selection. This feature is called "AutoSelect." When
you double-click any of the cell's borders, Microsoft Excel moves the
active selection in that direction (if possible).
<P>
Using this feature is similar to using CTRL+ARROW (to move the active cell)
and SHIFT+CTRL+ the UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT ARROW keys (to extend a
selection).
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you use AutoSelect, the cell you move to and the cells that are
selected may be different from those that are selected when you use CTRL
with the arrow keys. Two factors that affect the behavior of the AutoSelect
feature are the following:

<UL><LI>The way the data is arranged on your worksheet
<P>
   -and-

<LI>Whether the cell you are starting from is blank, and whether adjacent
   cells are blank.
<P>
</UL>In most cases CTRL+ARROW will move one cell further than AutoSelect. For
example, if you are starting from a blank cell with adjacent blank cells
and cells containing data beyond that, CTRL+ARROW will select the next cell
with data and AutoSelect will go to the last blank cell before the data
begins. If, however, you're starting from a blank cell with adjacent cells
containing contiguous data, AutoSelect will move to the last cell
containing data, while CTRL+ARROW will move only to the first cell.
<P>
Also, CTRL+ARROW will move to the end of the worksheet (row 16384 or
column IV) if all the cells in the direction you select are blank.
AutoSelect will not move the active cell if all of the cells in the
direction you select are blank.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Example</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Enter any data into a blank worksheet:
<P>
<PRE>   A1: 1  B1:   C1: 1  D1: 1
   B1:    B2: 1 C2: 1  D2: 1

</PRE><P><LI>Select A1. While holding down the CTRL key press the Right
   Arrow Key.
<P>
   The active cell is moved to cell C1.

<P><LI>Again select cell A1. Double-click the right border of cell A1.
<P>
   The active cell is now moved to cell B1.
<P>
</OL>Try the above steps using cell A2 in place of A1. Note the differences in
behavior between the two approaches to navigation.
<P>
NOTE: To select cells using AutoSelect, hold down the SHIFT key while
double-clicking the border of the active cell. Excel will select the
range of cells from the active cell to the last cell selected.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design in Microsoft Excel version 4.0. The algorithm
was modified this way intentionally to provide greater utility value to
both selection and navigation.
