*** Saving the Application Template ***
<P>
Although the EIS application file based on APP.XLA uses the XLA file
extension, internally it is a standard Microsoft Excel *.XLS workbook.  As
a standard workbook file, it may be unhidden using the Unhide command on
the Window menu.  By default, this file is hidden so that it is not
displayed to end-users when the EIS application is started.  If you unhide
this file, it is recommended that you hide it again using the new EIS
utility "Hide Application Workbook."  Should you decide to keep the
application file unhidden, be sure the sheet named "APP" is always the
first sheet in the workbook, and that it is active when you save the file.
By default, the EIS Save command and the Hide Application Workbook utility
always save the application template with the APP sheet active as the first
sheet in the workbook.
<P>
When saving the EIS application with the EIS Save command, you will have a
choice of saving a single document or all documents.  It is recommended
that the Yes to All button be used, so that files are saved with the proper
links.  Even after saving your work with the EIS Save command, Microsoft
Excel may prompt you to save worksheets containing EIS views when you close
these files.  When prompted, it is important to choose the Yes button, so
that file links are properly maintained.  If EIS cannot find macros, or if
alert messages such as "Cannot find APP.XLA!msm.L001" appear, examine the
application using the Microsoft Excel Links command on the Edit menu.  When
manually updating links, remember that all EIS view worksheets must be
linked to your application workbook based on APP.XLA.  Until you use the
EIS Save command, this link will point to APP.XLA.  After you use the EIS
Save command, however, this link will be updated to your EIS application
<PRE>workbook.   For example, if you defined an EIS view on a file named
</PRE>EISVIEWS.XLS, but had never saved your application with the EIS Save
command, EISVIEWS.XLS would automatically be linked to APP.XLA.  If you
then used the EIS Save command and saved the application as MYEIS.XLA, the
EISVIEWS.XLS workbook would be linked to MYEIS.XLA rather than APP.XLA.
<P>
<P>
<P>
*** Naming Sheets ***
<P>
Throughout the run-time code in the EIS.XLA, the EIS Builder uses a variety
of methods to find worksheets containing views. These methods require that
worksheet names not contain square brackets ([ or ]) since these characters
have special meaning in the Microsoft Excel reference naming convention
('[book]Sheet Name'!Cell_ref).  Therefore, the EIS Builder does not support
views defined on worksheets with the "[" or "]" characters in the worksheet
name.
<P>
<P>
<P>
*** Using ! in References ***
<P>
When using cell references in script action conditions or with the IF-THEN-
ELSE.IF action, references on the active EIS view sheet must be preceded
with an exclamation point (!).  For example, to run a script action only
when cell C1 is greater than 0, the conditional argument for the action
would be !C1 &gt; 0.  This syntax is required to direct the macros to the
active sheet containing the reference.  Without the exclamation point, the
macro would look for the reference on the *.XLA run-time or EIS application
workbooks, resulting in a failure when the reference is not found.
<P>
Additionally, the exclamation point is a required prefix whenever names are
used.  For example, if MYMACRO is defined as a name on a sheet called 'My
First Sheet,' any references to MYMACRO made by EIS script actions would
require that the reference be '!MYMACRO'.  In the event that local names
are referenced on sheets other than the active worksheet, the entire
book/sheet/cell reference is required, even if the reference is a local
name in the active workbook.  For example, the active worksheet in the file
MYEIS.XLS is named "My First Sheet."  If you wish to perform an action
based on a value called "Sales" in the "My Second Sheet" worksheet, the
reference would have to be to '[MYEIS.XLS]My Second Sheet'!Sales.  Use of a
reference to only 'Sales' or 'My Second Sheet'!Sales would fail.  For more
information about required reference syntax, see online Help for the script
action or condition that you would like to use.
<P>
<P>
<P>
*** Preventing Recursion Problems ***
<P>
There are two EIS author errors that can result in recursion problems.
Both are easily avoidable, and both appear to the EIS author as an
hourglass that never disappears.  Follow these guidelines to prevent
recursion problems:
<P>
*  After starting the EIS builder by opening AUTHOR.XLA, do not reopen
AUTHOR.XLA.  If AUTHOR.XLA is reopened while it is already loaded, the EIS
code loses control of its internal settings, resulting in an hourglass that
never clears.  If you wish to close the EIS Builder, choose the Exit
command from the EIS menu.  After exiting the EIS Builder, you may reload
AUTHOR.XLA without closing and restarting Microsoft Excel.
<P>
* Do not use the Display View script action as part of a view transition
script (On View Enter, On View Exit, On View Open, On View Close).  For
example, when entering the view A, do not run a script that displays view
B.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
*** Miscellaneous Information ***
<P>
*  A new alert style has been added to the EIS Builder.  In addition to
"Information" and "Warning," there are now two types of question alert
messages.  The "Question" alert style that displays OK and Cancel buttons
has been changed to the "Question: OK/Cancel" style.  The new "Question:
<PRE>Yes/No" style displays Yes and No buttons.   To specify an alert style,
</PRE>choose the Application script action class, select Alert Box, choose the
Add button, and then select an alert style from the drop-down list.
<P>
*  The EIS Builder does not support multiple windows for one view workbook.
While creating an application, do not use the New Window command to display
duplicate versions of a single workbook.
<P>
*  While the EIS Builder is loaded, the Delete key is disabled while a
module is active.  To delete text from the module window, use the Backspace
key.  Alternatively, you may select text to be deleted and use the Cut
command on the Edit menu or the Cut toolbar button.
<P>
*  When using the Unprotect Sheet action, it is essential that a password
be supplied if the sheet requires one.  For information about using sheet
protection passwords, see the "Unprotect Worksheet Action" topic in online
Help.
<P>
<P>
<P>
II - ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR USERS UPGRADING EIS VERSION 1.0
APPLICATIONS
<P>
*** Merging Multiple Microsoft Excel Version 4.0 Files
<PRE>    into Microsoft Excel Version 5.0 Workbooks ***

</PRE>After upgrading an application to EIS version 1.1, single-sheet workbooks
will support EIS views just as they did before.  To integrate multiple
single-worksheet Microsoft Excel version 4.0 files into a workbook in
Microsoft Excel version 5.0, use the following guidelines:
<P>
*  When creating workbooks with views defined on different worksheets,
remember that some EIS actions trigger the Microsoft Excel recalculation
engine.  For example, the Apply Conditional Style action requires a
recalculation before the conditional style is applied.  In cases where
large multiple worksheets are recalculated, performance of the EIS
application may be slightly slower than that of single worksheet files.
(Recalculation time is not affected by blank worksheets, only by worksheets
containing formulas.)  For more information about changing the default
recalculation of Microsoft Excel, see  the Microsoft Excel documentation.
<P>
*  Be sure to copy the entire worksheet rather than just the EIS view
range.  By copying the entire sheet, you will be assured that references
and names outside the view range will also be copied.  To copy an entire
sheet, use the Move Or Copy Sheet command on the Microsoft Excel Edit menu.
For information about moving or copying worksheets by dragging the sheet
tab, see the Microsoft Excel documentation.
<P>
*  After consolidating multiple Microsoft Excel version 4.0 worksheets into
a single Microsoft Excel version 5.0 workbook, save the new file as a
Microsoft Excel version 5.0 workbook.  Then use the Windows File Manager to
move the original documents from the EIS application directory to another
directory.  This will prevent the EIS Builder from attempting to open the
original Microsoft Excel version 4.0 view files.
<P>
*  Using the EIS Run command, run the application from the beginning.  When
the EIS Builder is unable to open the Microsoft Excel version 4.0 files
containing the views you have moved into the Microsoft Excel version 5.0
workbook, a standard browse dialog box will appear.  Use this dialog box to
select the Microsoft Excel version 5.0 workbook containing the views that
you have consolidated from the Microsoft Excel version 4.0 worksheets.
<P>
*  Save the EIS application with the EIS Save command.  From this point on,
the application will look the for the EIS views in the new Microsoft Excel
version 5.0 workbook rather than in the original Microsoft Excel version
4.0 worksheet files.  As with any change to your application, be sure to
test the application thoroughly before distributing it to your end users.
<P>
<P>
<P>
*** Renaming the Splash File ***
<P>
After upgrading applications from EIS version 1.0, do not change the name
of the splash file or the name of the splash file sheet.  If for some
reason the splash file name must be changed, follow these instructions to
change the Auto Open macro of your EIS application template file.

<OL><P><LI>Make a backup up file of your EIS application *.XLA file.  This is the
</OL>file based upon the APP.XLA template.

<OL><P><LI>From the Window menu, choose Unhide. This displays the EIS application
</OL>code.

<OL><P><LI>Go to the Auto_Open macro.  In applications upgrade from version 1.0,
</OL>this macro is usually found on the APP sheet in the range B35:B55.

<OL><P><LI>Select the entire range of the Auto_Open macro.

<P><LI>From  the Microsoft Excel Edit menu, choose Replace.
   In the Find What field, enter GET.DOCUMENT(1)
<P>
   Note:  GET.DOCUMENT will differ according to the language version of
   Microsoft Excel.  Depending upon your version of Microsoft Excel,
   use the function listed below.
<P>
<PRE>      English:       GET.DOCUMENT()
      French:        LIRE.DOCUMENT()
      German:        DATEI.ZUORDNEN()


</PRE><P><LI>In the Replace With field, enter GET.DOCUMENT(68)
   Note:  Users of non-English  versions of Microsoft Excel should use the
   translated GET.DOCUMENT() function listed above.

<P><LI>Choose the Replace All button

<P><LI>From the EIS menu, choose Utility, and then choose the Hide Application
   Workbook utility

<P><LI>From the EIS menu, choose  Save.
<P>
</OL>Once these steps are completed, the splash file name can be changed at any
time.  Also, these steps are not necessary when creating an entirely new
application using EIS Builder version 1.1.
<P>
<P>
<P>
*** Running External Macros ***
<P>
Script actions using the Run External Macro action require that the macro
file be open.  If the "Cannot Run Custom Macro" alert message appears while
running upgraded applications, make sure that the  macro workbook specified
in the failed script is open.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
III - ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR INTERNATIONAL USERS
<P>
*** Supported Languages in Microsoft Excel ***
<P>
This version of the EIS Builder requires Microsoft Excel version 5.0 in
English, French, or German.  For information about the availability of EIS
Builder in other languages, please contact your local Microsoft subsidiary.
<P>
<P>
<P>
*** Changes to the Microsoft Excel EIS Builder User's Guide
<PRE>    Installation Information ***

</PRE></OL>Please note the following minor changes to information on page 35 of the
Microsoft Excel EIS Builder User's Guide:
<P>
*  When running the Microsoft Open EIS Pak Setup, you will not be prompted
for the location of your version of Microsoft Excel.  This information is
automatically read from the [Embedding] section of your WIN.INI file.  If
you have multiple versions of Microsoft Excel installed on your machine,
you will need to comment out all versions in your WIN.INI file except  the
one with which you want to use the EIS Builder.  Follow these steps to
comment out a line in your WIN.INI file.

<OL><P><LI>Open the file using either NOTEPAD or SYSEDIT.

<P><LI>Find the line you want to comment out.

<P><LI>Type a semicolon (;) at the beginning of the line.

<P><LI>Save and close the file.

<P><LI>Reboot Microsoft Windows.
<P>
<P>
</OL>*  The following files are no longer installed when a non-English version
of Microsoft Excel version 5.0 is found:
<PRE>        - APP.XLS
        - MENU.XLS

</PRE></OL>Instead, the standard APP.XLA and MENU.XLA files are installed.
<P>
*** Load the EIS Builder By Opening AUTHOR.XLA ***
<P>
After completing the EIS localization process described in Appendix C of
the Microsoft Excel EIS Builder User's Guide, you no longer need the
AUTHOR.XLS file.  It is recommended that you delete this file to prevent it
from being used accidentally.
Always load the EIS Builder by opening the AUTHOR.XLA file.
<P>
<P>
<P>
*** Copying EIS.XLA to the Macro Library Directory ***
<P>
During the localization process described in Appendix C of the Microsoft
Excel EIS Builder User's Guide, the REPLACE.XLA macros will attempt to save
a copy of EIS.XLA in the following directory.
<P>
<PRE>   Language       Microsoft Excel Library Directory
   -------------- ---------------------------------
   French         MACROLIB
   German         MAKRO

</PRE>If the library directory cannot be found, the EIS.XLA file will be saved in
you EIS Builder directory.  To minimize duplicate copies of this run-time
file, you can create the library directory and move the EIS.XLA file at a
later time.  If the EIS.XLA file is not found in the library directory,
then a duplicate copy must reside in each directory containing an EIS
application.
<P>
<P>
<P>
*** Example Application ***
<P>
EIS authors using a non-English version of Microsoft Excel should be aware
that some of the sample views in the EIS Author XAMPLS.XLA application may
not work properly.  The XAMPLS.XLA application was created using the
English language version of the EIS Builder.  The EIS Builder does not
support applications built in one language version of Microsoft Excel to be
run in another, so some feature samples will not work properly.
Nevertheless, the information described in the Help boxes of these views
will still work in applications created and run in any other language
supported by the EIS Builder.
<P>
<P>
