<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0c
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows NT, version 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, versions 7.0, 7.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, when you print a report (from the File menu, choose
Print Report), the pages in your report are not numbered consecutively.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The pages of your report may not be numbered consecutively if the First
Page Number setting in the Page Setup dialog box was set to Auto, instead
of 1, when the first view in the report was added.
<P>
The Print Report command uses the first view in the report to determine the
initial page number: when this number is Auto, the Print Report add-in does
not acknowledge the Use Continuous Page Numbers setting in the Add Report
and Edit Report dialog boxes; instead, each view begins with page 1.
<P>
<P><h3>Example</h3>
 
<P>
If you have a workbook that contains four worksheets, each with the
following defined views
<P>
<PRE>   Worksheet   Defined Views
   -------------------------

   Sheet1      View1, ViewA
   Sheet2      View2, ViewB
   Sheet3      View3, ViewC
   Sheet4      View4, ViewD

</PRE>and you want to print a report that includes the following views (in the
order shown)
<P>
<PRE>   Sheet3, View3
   Sheet2, ViewB
   Sheet1, View1
   Sheet4, ViewD

</PRE>and you want to use continuous page numbers, the Use Continuous Page
Numbers setting will not work correctly unless the First Page Number
setting was set to 1 at the time View3 (the first view in the
report) was added.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
To print reports with continuous page numbers, the first view in the report
must have its First Page Number setting set to 1. To change this setting
for your reports, do either of the following:

<UL><LI>Change the First Page Number setting for all sheets to 1 BEFORE you add
   any views
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Change the First Page Number setting for the first view in the report,
   and redefine the view
<P>
</UL>NOTE: To use either of these workarounds, the Use Continuous Page Numbers
check box (in the Edit Report or Add Report dialog box) must be selected.
<P>
To change the First Page Number
<P><h3>Setting for all sheets before adding views</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>From the sheet tab shortcut menu, choose Select All Sheets.

<P><LI>With all the sheets selected, choose Page Setup from the File menu, and
   select the Page tab.

<P><LI>In the First Page Number box, type "1" (without the quotation marks),
   and choose OK.
<P>
</OL>To change the First Page Number setting for the
<P><h3>First view in the report, and then redefine that view</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Activate the sheet that contains the first view in the report.

<P><LI>From the View menu, choose View Manager.

<P><LI>From the list of Views, choose the first view in the report and choose
   the Show button.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Page Setup, and select the Page tab.

<P><LI>In the First Page Number box, type "1" (without the quotation marks) and
   choose OK to accept the change.

<P><LI>From the View menu, choose View Manager. In the View Manager dialog box,
   choose the Add button.

<P><LI>In the Name box, type
<P>
<P><PRE>      View3
</PRE><P>
   where View3 is the name of the first view in your report.

<P><LI>Under Include With View, make sure that the Print Settings check box is
   selected. Choose OK.

<P><LI>When you are prompted to "Overwrite existing view &lt;viewname&gt;?", choose
   OK.
<P>
</OL>When you print the report, the report should be printed using continuous
page numbers.
<P>
NOTE: If a different view is printed first, you will need to redefine that
view so that the First Page Number setting is 1, not Auto.
