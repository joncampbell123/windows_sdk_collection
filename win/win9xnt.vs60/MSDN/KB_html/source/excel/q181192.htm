<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you create a chart sheet in Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition, you
may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Your file could not be printed due to an error on unknown
   printer (check Chooser). There are several possible reasons:

   - There may not be enough memory available. Try closing files and
     programs you aren't using.

   - Your printer or its driver may not be set up correctly. See the OS
     Guide for your computer for instructions to check or set up the
     printer.

   - If you use a network for printing, there may be a problem with the
     network connection or the printer driver.

   - There may be loose cables or a bad connection between your computer
     and printer.

</PRE>When you click OK, the chart sheet appears correctly.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may occur if you have not installed at least one printer
driver on your computer.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this problem, make sure that you have at least one printer
driver installed on your computer. If the problem continues to occur, make
sure that you have enough available memory and that the printer is set up
and connected correctly.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
