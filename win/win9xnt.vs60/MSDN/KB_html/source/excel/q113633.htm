The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Q+E, versions 3.0, 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 3.0, 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In Q+E, you can construct a query that will create a new file containing
all the records from one file that do not have matching records in a second
file. This type of query is called a subtract query.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Overview of Subtract Query Procedure</h3>
 
<P>
To perform the subtract query, use the Outer Join command to join the two
files, then add a condition to the end of the resulting SQL query text.
Running this query results in a new file; the contents of the source and
destination files are left unchanged.
<P>
NOTE: The "Q+E User's Guide" uses the terms "source" and "destination" to
refer to the two files being joined. The destination file is the file whose
window is active when you choose the Outer Join command. In this procedure,
the destination file is the file that contains the unmatched records.
<P>
The example below uses the sample files that ship with Microsoft Excel
version 4.0. The default location for these files is EXCEL\QE. If these
files are not installed on your system, you must run a custom setup and
reinstall Q+E.
<P>
<P><h3>Example of Subtract Query Procedure</h3>

article is at your own risk. Microsoft provides this SQL statement "as is"

<OL><P><LI>In Q+E, open the source and destination files. For this example, open
   ADDR.DBF and EMP.DBF.
<P>
   To Arrange these files side by side, choose the Arrange All command from
   the Window menu.

<P><LI>Select the EMP_ID field in ADDR.DBF to match on, and select the EMP_ID
   field in EMP.DBF.

<P><LI>With the EMP.DBF (the destination file) window active, choose Outer Join
   from the Select menu.

<P><LI>From the Select menu, choose SQL Query.

<P><LI>Place the insertion point at the end of the query text and type a space.
   After the space, type "AND ADDR.EMP_ID IS NULL" (without the quotation
   marks).

<P><LI>Choose OK to run this query.
<P>
</OL>The resulting table should display the six records that are in EMP.DBF but
are not in ADDR.DBF.
<P>
Note that there are blank fields to the right, beginning with the INTERESTS
field. To remove these fields, do either of the following:

<UL><LI>Select a column, then choose Remove Column from the Layout menu. Repeat
   this procedure for each column you want to remove.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>From the Select menu, choose SQL Query, remove the undesired field names
   from the query text, and then choose OK. (NOTE: The field names appear
   between the SQL key words SELECT and FROM.)
<P>
</UL>The queried data can now be pasted into Microsoft Excel or saved as a query
or a table.
