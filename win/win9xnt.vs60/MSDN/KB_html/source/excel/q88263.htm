The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The following is the contents of the README file which is located on the
Disk 1-Setup disk. It is also placed in the folder to which Microsoft Excel
is installed. The text describes various considerations when installing or
using version 4.0 of Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>

<P>
<P>
 
<P><h3>Files on Microsoft Excel Disks are Compressed</h3>
 
<P>
All files on Microsoft Excel version 4.0 disks are compressed, except
READ ME and README--NETWORK. In order to install Microsoft Excel, you
must run Microsoft Excel Setup -- you cannot install by simply copying
the files from the Microsoft Excel disks to your hard disk.
<P>
<P>
 
<P><h3>Turn Off Virus Protection Before Running Setup</h3>
 
<P>
If you maintain a virus protection program on your computer, turn it
off (or engage its override function) before running the Microsoft
Excel Setup program. Microsoft Excel Setup will not run properly with
virus protection turned on. After running Setup, be sure to reactivate
your virus protection program.
<P>
<P>
 
<P><h3>Disable Directory Assistance Utility Before Running Setup</h3>
 
<P>
If you use Directory Assistance or Directory Assistance II, you must
disable it before running the Microsoft Excel Setup program. To
disable it, move the Directory Assistance file from your System Folder
to another location and restart your computer. Once you have installed
Microsoft Excel you can move the file back to your System Folder.
<P>
<P>
 
<P><h3>Rebuilding the Desktop after Installing Microsoft Excel</h3>
 
<P>
If you use a system software version earlier than system software
version 7.0, you may need to rebuild your Macintosh desktop after
installing Microsoft Excel in order for the new Microsoft Excel
document icons to appear. You can do this by restarting your computer
while holding down the COMMAND and OPTION keys.
<P>
<P>
 
<P><h3>Running the Microsoft Excel Tutorial</h3>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Excel tutorial is a HyperCard stack and requires
HyperCard version 1.2 or later. To experience the full effect of the
tutorial's features, make the following Control Panel adjustments if
necessary:

<UL><LI>Set Monitors to Black &amp; White
<LI>Set the Sound control to an audible level
<P>
</UL>Also, if you use only TrueType fonts on your computer, and you have
not installed Geneva9 and Geneva12, text in the Instructions and Index
screens in the "Learning Microsoft Excel" tutorial will appear
distorted and will run off the screen.
<P>
<P>
 
<P><h3>Installing Microsoft Excel Version 4.0 Over Version 3.0</h3>
 
<P>
If you do not need to keep Microsoft Excel version 3.0 on your
computer as you become accustomed to version 4.0, you can install
version 4.0 in the same folder as version 3.0. Most Microsoft Excel
version 3.0 files will be replaced by updated version 4.0 files. Of
the files that are not replaced, you can continue to use most with
version 4.0. However, you can delete the following files -- version
4.0 installs updated versions of these files, but they are not
replaced during setup because the new files have different names or
are located in different folders:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel Tutorial
   (In the main Microsoft Excel folder; 774k, created Mon, Mar 25, 1991)
<LI>Amortization Table
   (In the Macro Library folder; 14k, created Mon, Mar 25, 1991)
<LI>Sales Tracking
   (In the Macro Library folder; 2k, created Mon, Mar 25, 1991)
<LI>College Expenses
   (In the Macro Library folder; 9k, created Mon, Mar 25, 1991)
<LI>College Helper
   (In the Macro Library folder; 4k, created Mon, Mar 25, 1991)
<LI>DAL Start
   (In the Excel Startup Folder in your System Folder; 12k, created Mon,
   Mar 25, 1991)
<LI>DAL Read.me
   (In the Data Access Files folder in the Excel Startup Folder in your
   System Folder; 5k, created Mon, Mar 25, 1991)
<LI>DAL Start
   (In the Data Access Files folder in the Excel Startup Folder in your
   System Folder; 12k, created Mon, Mar 25, 1991)
<LI>Data Access Macro
   (In the Data Access Files folder in the Excel Startup Folder in your
   System Folder; 166k, created Mon, Mar 25, 1991, or 167k, created Mon,
   Sep 16, 1991)
<LI>Solver Add-in
   (In the Solver folder in the Excel Startup Folder in your System Folder;
   152k, created Mon, Mar 25, 1991)
<LI>Solver Reports Add-in
   (In the Solver folder in the Excel Startup Folder in your System Folder;
   41k, created Mon, Mar 25, 1991)
<P>
</UL>Note: If you have any worksheets macros or templates in Excel Startup
Folder and want to use them for Microsoft Excel version 4.0, you must
move them to Excel Startup Folder (4), also in your System Folder.
<P>
In general, you can identify remaining Microsoft Excel version 3.0
files by their creation dates, either Wed, Apr 3, 1991 or Mon, Mar 25,
1991.
<P>
For a complete listing of Microsoft Excel 4.0 files and their
locations, see "Microsoft Excel Version 4.0 Folder/File Layout," later
in this document.
<P>
<P>
 
<P><h3>File Compatibility with Previous Microsoft Excel Versions</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft Excel version 4.0 reads all existing Microsoft Excel version
1.0x, 1.5, 2.x and 3.0 documents. However, documents saved in
Microsoft Excel version 4.0 format cannot be opened in Microsoft Excel
version 3.0a or earlier. To open a Microsoft Excel version 4.0
document in an earlier version of Microsoft Excel, choose the Save As
command from the File menu, and select the "Excel 3.0" or "Excel 2.2"
file format. It is a good idea to rename the file so you do not delete
the version 4.0 copy of the file.
<P>
Note: You may lose some formulas, formatting, and objects on
worksheets when the document is saved in an earlier format.
<P>
<P>
 
<P><h3>Macro Compatibility with Previous Microsoft Excel Versions</h3>
 
<P>
Macros developed in previous versions of Microsoft Excel are fully
compatible with Microsoft Excel version 4.0.
<P>
<P>
 
<P><h3>New Add-in Macro: Movie Maker</h3>
 
<P>
A late addition to the Microsoft Excel package is the Movie Maker
add-in macro. If you have system software version 7.0, the QuickTime
system extension, and the MoviePlayer application, you can use this
add-in macro to create short animations of Microsoft Excel charts. For
more information, see Microsoft Excel online Help:

<OL><P><LI>Double-click the Help tool.
<P>
   Microsoft Excel displays the Help Search dialog box.

<P><LI>In the text box, type: Movie Maker
<P>
   "Movie Maker" is selected in the search list.

<P><LI>Press ENTER or double-click "Movie Maker."

<P><LI>Choose the Go To button.
<P>
</OL>(QuickTime and MoviePlayer are registered trademarks of Apple
Computer, Inc.)
<P>
<P>
 
<P><h3>OPEN.DIALOG and SAVE.DIALOG Functions</h3>
 
<P>
These two macro functions were inadvertently omitted from the
Microsoft Excel Function Reference. The functions become available
when you install the File Functions add-in macro. You can read about
the functions in online Help:

<OL><P><LI>Double-click the Help tool.
<P>
   Microsoft Excel displays the Help Search dialog box.

<P><LI>In the text box, type: file functions
<P>
   "File Functions" is selected in the search list.

<P><LI>Press ENTER or double-click "File Functions."

<P><LI>Choose the Go To button.
<P>
<P>
</OL> 
Undocumented Keyboard Shortcuts for Workbooks
------------------------------=--------------
<P>
The following shortcut keys were inadvertently omitted from Microsoft
Excel printed documentation:

<UL><LI>SHIFT+COMMAND+A is equivalent to choosing the Add button in the
   Workbook Contents window.
<LI>SHIFT+COMMAND+R is equivalent to choosing the Remove button in the
   Workbook Contents window.
<LI>SHIFT+COMMAND+O is equivalent to choosing the Options button in the
   Workbook Contents window.
<P>
<P>
</UL> 
<P><h3>Microsoft Excel Version 4.0 Folder/File Layout</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft Excel version 4.0 Setup places the following folders and
files on your computer's hard disk. Folders are shown in brackets [ ].
The list reflects the installation of all options.
<P>
Setup places some folders and files in your System folder, as
indicated below. Certain Microsoft Excel features and operations
depend on these files in these locations. Please do not move or remove
them.

<P><h3>Files/Folders Placed in [System Folder]</h3>
