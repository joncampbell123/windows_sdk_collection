The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In the versions of Microsoft Excel listed at the beginning of this article,
if you click the Next Comment or Previous Comment tool on the Reviewing
toolbar, the next or previous comment in the worksheet may not appear on
the screen.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may occur when the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>You have hidden all objects from view by following these steps:
<P>
<P><PRE>    1. On the Tools menu, click Options or Preferences. Click the View
       tab.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    2. Under Objects, click Hide All, and then click OK.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    -and-
</PRE>
<LI>You have deleted a comment from the worksheet by right-clicking the
   cell or by pressing CONTROL and clicking the cell, and then clicking
   Delete Comment on the shortcut menu, or by clicking the Delete Comment
   tool on the Reviewing toolbar.
<P>
</UL>When you click the Next Comment or Previous Comment tool, the status bar
displays the cell address and the name of the user who entered a comment.
However, the comment itself does not appear.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Options or Preferences. Click the View
   tab.

<P><LI>Click Show All or Show Placeholders, and then click OK.
<P>
</OL>The comments appear correctly when you click the Next Comment or Previous
Comment tool.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In the versions of Microsoft Excel listed at the beginning of this article,
you can use the tools on the Reviewing toolbar to work with comments in a
worksheet.
<P>
Because comments are similar to drawing objects, displaying comments is
affected when you click Hide All in the View tab of the Options dialog box.
As long as you do not delete any comments, you can use the tools on the
Reviewing toolbar to browse through the comments in a worksheet.
<P>
However, once you delete a comment, you must cancel the selection of Hide
All. If you do not do this, the Reviewing tools do not work correctly. This
problem continues until you quit and restart Microsoft Excel.
