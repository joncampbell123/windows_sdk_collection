<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
You can use a Gantt Chart to show the progress of a project or the
relationship among the tasks in a project in relation to time. The unit of
time that is most frequently used is the day unit. However, you can also
use the hour as the unit of time to show the status of the task. To do
this, alter the scale of the value (y) axis.
<P>
This article contains an example that uses the hour as the unit of time to
show the status of a task.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The scale in a normal Gantt Chart is based on the serial number of the
date. The scale used for the value (y) axis is as follows.
<P>
<PRE>   Axis Setting                   Value or definition
   ------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Minimum                        Serial number of earliest date or some
                                  date before the earliest date.
   Maximum                        Serial number of latest date or a date
                                  greater than the latest date.
   Major Unit                     31, or one month.
   Minor Unit                     1, or one day.
   "Category(X) Axis Crosses at"  Same as the Minimum setting.

</PRE>Time is entered as a fraction or decimal representation of part of a single
day. The scale used for a Gantt Chart that is based on hours is as follows.
<P>
<PRE>   Axis Setting                    Value or definition
   ------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Minimum                         The decimal number representing the
                                   earliest hour charted.
   Maximum                         1.0, or a single day.
   Major Unit                      .0417, or the decimal equivalent of 1
                                   hour.
   Minor Unit                      .000694, or the decimal equivalent of 1
                                   minute, or .01 (if minutes are not a
                                   factor).
   "Category (X) Axis Crosses at"  Same as Minimum.

</PRE>To alter the scale, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Type the following data into a worksheet:
<P>
<PRE>      A1: Depts  B1: Start    C1: End      D1: Duration1  E1: Duration2
      A2: NC     B2: 8:30 AM  C2: 5:00 PM  D2: 8.5        E2:
      A3: TX     B3: 8:30 AM  C3: 5:30 PM  D3: 9          E3:
      A4: AZ     B4: 3:00 PM  C4: 12:00PM  D4: 9          E4:
      A5: WA     B5: 8:30 AM  C5: 6:30 PM  D5: 10         E5:

   This information shows the times at which four sites across the country
   start a work day in relation to the other sites. (The times are all
   entered as Eastern Standard time.)

</PRE><P><LI>In cell E2, type the following formula to convert the duration, which is
   expressed in hours, to a decimal fraction of a single day:
<P>
<P><PRE>      =D2*0.0417
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: The value 0.0417 is the decimal equivalent of one hour.

<P><LI>With cell E2 selected, use the fill handle to fill the formula
   down to cell E5.

<P><LI>Create the chart by using the following steps:
<P>
   Microsoft Excel 97 or Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition:
<P>
<P><PRE>       a. On the Insert menu, click Chart.
</PRE><P>

       f. In the Category (X) Axis Labels box, delete any existing values,
          select A2:A5 on the worksheet, and click Next.

       g. In step 3 of the Chart Wizard, click Next.

       e. In step 4, click Data Series in Columns, click Use First 1
          Column(s) as Category (X) Axis Labels, click Use First 1 Row(s)
          for Legend Text, and then click Finish.

</PRE><P><LI>In Microsoft Excel 97 or Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition, with the
   Chart sheet active, click Chart Type on the Chart menu. Click the second
   chart type, the stacked bar, and click OK.
<P>
   In Microsoft Excel 5.0 or 7.0, with the Chart sheet active, click Chart
   Type on the Format menu. In the Chart Type dialog box, click Options.
   This step opens the Format Bar Group dialog box. Click the Subtype tab,
   click the middle option (the stacked bar), and then click OK.

<P><LI>Select the first series on the chart and click Selected Data Series on
   the Format menu. Click the Patterns tab, change the Border and Area to
   None, and click OK.
<P>
   The series becomes transparent.
<P>
   NOTE: In this example, the first series is a place holder that places
   the second series in the correct position on the chart.

<P><LI>Next, change the scale of the value (y) axis to reflect the use of hours
   instead of days. To do this, select the value (y) axis and click
   Selected Axis on the Format menu. Click the Scale tab, type following
   values for the following settings.
<P>
<PRE>      Axis Setting                    Value

      Minimum:                        .33333 (8:00 am)
      Maximum:                        1.0
      Major Unit:                     .0417
      Minor Unit:                     .01
      "Category (X) Axis Crosses at"  .33333

   Then, click OK. (see the "More Information" section for an explanation
   of these values.)

   The chart that results displays the duration of each shift as a floating
   bar. The left edge of each bar is the starting time, and the right edge
   is the ending time. The relative positions of the bars show the
   relationships among the shifts.
