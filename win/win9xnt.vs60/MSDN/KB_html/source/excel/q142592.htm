The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you change the zoom magnification in an embedded chart and save and
reopen the workbook, the x and y axis chart titles and the chart legend
move slightly toward the center of the chart. In addition, the width of the
plotted chart increases slightly if you decrease the zoom magnification,
and it decreases in size if you increase the zoom magnification. The
changes in the embedded chart become more obvious when you save and reopen
the workbook several times.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs when you do all of the following:

<UL><LI>You create an embedded a chart that contains x or y axis titles or
   a legend.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>You select a zoom magnification other than 100 percent.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>You save, close, and reopen the workbook that contains the chart.
<P>
</UL>Each time you subsequently save, close, and reopen the workbook, the
changes in the chart become more apparent.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, use either of the following methods.
<P>
Method 1:  Completely reinsert the chart. Use this method if the chart can
<PRE>           easily be re-created and you want to restore all the affected
           chart items. To reinsert the chart, use the following steps:

           a. Select the chart and delete it. Do not delete the data on
              which the chart is based.

           b. Select the cells on the worksheet that contain the chart
              data, and click the Chart Wizard button.

           c. Select the desired chart options and continue to click Next
              on each screen until you reach the end of the Chart Wizard.
              Click Finished.

           d. To insert axis titles, double-click the chart, click Titles
              on the Insert menu, select Value (Y) Axis and Category (X)
              Axis, and click OK.

</PRE>Method 2:  Reinsert just the titles and the legend to restore their
<PRE>           positions and then manually resize the chart plot area. Use this
           method if the chart contains a lot of formatting and you cannot
           easily re-create the chart:

           a. Double-click the chart, click Titles on the Insert menu,
              clear the Value (Y) Axis and Category (X) Axis check
              boxes, and click OK.

           b. Click the legend and delete it.

           c. To reinsert the axis titles, click Titles on the Insert menu,
              reselect the Value (Y) Axis and Category (X) Axis check
               boxes, and click OK.

           d. To reinsert the legend, click Legend on the Insert menu.

           e. To resize the chart plot area, click the plotted chart
              area such that the entire chart, excluding the titles and
              legend, is selected, and drag the handles (the small black
              boxes that appear on the selected chart) to resize the
              chart.

</PRE><h2>Status</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products 
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in
Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0a.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The size of the chart plot area is actually changing; this change in size
causes the titles and the legend to appear to move toward the center of the
chart.
