The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows

<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 97, the process you use to create an add-in file is
different than the process for earlier versions of Microsoft Excel. This
article contains detailed information about how to create an add-in (.xla)
file in Microsoft Excel 97.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Add-in File Behavior</h3>
 
<P>
An add-in file in Microsoft Excel is a special type of workbook. An add-in
file can contain worksheets, chart sheets, and Visual Basic for Application
macros and functions. Macros and functions in an add-in file add optional
commands and features to Microsoft Excel without allowing a user to
directly view or edit them.
<P>
Unlike normal workbooks, when you open an add-in file, it is not visible on
the screen, and you cannot unhide it by clicking Unhide on the Window menu.
An add-in file is displayed in the Project Explorer window in the Visual
Basic Editor. However, you cannot view or edit an add-in file if it is
protected with a password.
<P>
<P><h3>Creating an Add-in File</h3>
 
<P>
To create an add-in file in Microsoft Excel 97, use the following two-part
process:

<UL><LI>Protect the projects in the workbook to prevent them from being
   viewed or edited after you create the add-in file.

<LI>Save the workbook as an add-in file.
<P>
</UL>Protecting the projects is very important in Microsoft Excel 97. In earlier
versions of Microsoft Excel, it is not necessary to protect the contents of
an add-in file. However, in Microsoft Excel 97, if you do not protect
projects in the workbook, others can view and/or edit the sheets and Visual
Basic modules in the add-in file.
<P>
For more information about converting an add-in back into a workbook in
Microsoft Excel 97, see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:

    TITLE     : XL97: How to Convert an Add-in File into a Workbook

</PRE>Protecting the Projects in the Workbook:

<OL><P><LI>In Microsoft Excel, activate the workbook you want to convert to an add-
   in file.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, point to Macro, and click Visual Basic Editor.

<P><LI>In the Project Explorer window in the Visual Basic Editor, click the
   following bold entry:
<P>
<P><PRE>      &lt;Project name&gt; (&lt;File name&gt;)
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;Project name&gt; is the name of the Visual Basic project, and &lt;File
   name&gt; is the name of the workbook you want to convert.
<P>
   The entry will be similar to the following example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      VBAProject (Mybook.xls)
</PRE>
<P><LI>On the Tools menu, click &lt;Project name&gt; Properties.

<P><LI>Click the Protection tab.

<P><LI>Select (check) the "Lock project for viewing" check box. Type a password
   in the Password box. Type the same password in the "Confirm password"
   box, and click OK.
<P>
</OL>Saving the Workbook as an Add-in File:

<OL><P><LI>Close the Visual Basic Editor by clicking "Close and Return to Microsoft
   Excel" on the File menu.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Properties.

<P><LI>In the Properties dialog box click the Summary tab.

<P><LI>In the Title field, enter any name for your add-in. The name you provide
   will be the name that appears in the Add-Ins dialog box.

<P><LI>In the Comments field, enter any text that describes your add-in. This
   description will be displayed in the Add-Ins dialog box when you select
   your Add-In in the List of available add-ins.

<P><LI>Click OK to close the Properties dialog box.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Save As.

<P><LI>In the Save As dialog box, select "Microsoft Excel Add-In(*.xla)" in the
   Save As Type box. If you want, change the file name and click Save.
<P>
   When you click Save, Microsoft Excel creates the add-in.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Close.
<P>
</OL>After you create the add-in file, you can open the add-in file the same way
you open any workbook. If the add-in file contains an Auto_Open macro, the
macro runs and performs any actions for which it is programmed. Any
functions and subroutines in the add-in file are available for use in
Microsoft Excel.
