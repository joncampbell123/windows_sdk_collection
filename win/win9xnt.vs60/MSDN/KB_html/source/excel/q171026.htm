<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 97, if you copy a range of cells from one workbook and
paste the copied cells into another workbook, you may receive the following
error message:
<P>
<PRE>   This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down.
   If the problem persists, contact the program vendor.

</PRE>If you click Details, you receive an error message similar to the
following:
<P>
<PRE>   EXCEL caused an invalid page fault in module EXCEL.EXE at
   0137:3011fd8b.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs if you copy a range of cells that contain an array
formula, and then paste the copied cells into another workbook that
contains the same array formula in one of its worksheets.
<P>
For example, this problem occurs when Book1 and Book2 contain the following
array formulas:
<P>
<PRE>   Book1                       Book2
      Sheet1                      Sheet3
         A1: {=Sheet2!A1:A2}         B4: {=Sheet2!A1:A2}
         A2: {=Sheet2!A1:A2}         B5: {=Sheet2!A1:A2}

</PRE>Note that both workbooks contain the same array formula, =Sheet2!A1:A2. It
does not matter that the formulas are in different worksheets or cells
within each workbook.
<P>
If you copy cells B4:B5 in Sheet3 of Book2, and then paste them anywhere in
Book1, the problem occurs because Book1 contains the same formula.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, do not copy and paste array formulas, such as
those described in this article, between workbooks in Microsoft Excel 97.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Excel 97 for
Windows. This problem was corrected in Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows,
Service Release 1.
