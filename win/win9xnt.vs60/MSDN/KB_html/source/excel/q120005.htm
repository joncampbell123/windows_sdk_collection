The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, version 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, if you sort a filtered list that contains
subtotals, you receive a general protection (GP) fault when you
then perform any other action in the application.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Normally, the Undo Sort command is not available after performing a
sort on a list in Microsoft Excel. However, if you add subtotals to a
list of data, filter this list, and then sort the list, the Undo Sort
command is available on the Edit menu. When you chose this command,
or perform any other action in Microsoft Excel, such as opening
another workbook, or editing a cell, you receive a GP fault.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
To avoid receiving a GP fault after you sort a filtered list that contains
subtotals, do either of the following:

<UL><LI>Add subtotals to your list AFTER you sort your list. Because the Sort
   removes the subtotals from your list, you do not lose any functionality,
   and this is the preferred workaround.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Sort your list BEFORE you filter the list.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in
Microsoft Excel version 5.0c for Windows.
<P>
In Microsoft Excel version 5.0c, under the above conditions, when you
display the Edit menu, the Can't Undo command is listed, and unavailable,
indicating that you cannot undo the Sort command.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you add subtotals to a list in Microsoft Excel, and you then use
the Sort command on the Data menu, you receive the following message:
<P>
<PRE>   This removes the subtotals and sorts again. If you want to sort the
   subtotaled groups, choose the Cancel button; then collapse the outline
   and try again.

</PRE>If you choose OK to continue with the Sort, and then choose Undo Sort
from the Edit menu, you receive the GP fault as described above.
