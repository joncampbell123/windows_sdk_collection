<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Sometimes it takes a considerable amount of time to close one or more
sheets, or exit completely from Microsoft Excel. Usually this is caused by
an inefficient design of one or more sheets, or certain interactions
between sheets (that is, macro sheets, worksheets, and even charts).
Following some basic rules may greatly improve this somewhat rare, sluggish
behavior.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Listed below are some of the reasons why it may take very long to either
close a sheet or exit from Microsoft Excel:

<OL><P><LI>Calculation is slow.
<P>
   Possible Solutions
   ------------------
<P>
   a. From the Options menu, choose Calculation.
<P>
   b. Select Manual and uncheck Recalculate Before Save.
<P>
   c. If your spreadsheet contains data tables, select Automatic
<P><PRE>      Except Tables as your calculation mode.
</PRE><P>
   d. Optimize worksheet organization or redesign your model. (See
<P><PRE>      the pages referenced below.)
</PRE>
<P><LI>A Large number of links are used.
<P>
   If a source (supporting) sheet is closed, all the formulas that
   contain links in the dependent sheet need to be updated. The more
   links there are, the longer this takes.
<P>
   Example
   -------
<P>
   Sometimes it seems practical to use a large number of VLOOKUP
   functions to create the effect of dynamic data extraction. Often
   this constitutes very large arrays, conserving memory, but not
   reducing calculation time. When closing the independent (source)
   document first, all VLOOKUP functions need to be modified to
   include the path of the source data. After the independent sheet is
   closed, the dependent sheet may then first recalculate before it
   closes too. This process can take up to 10 minutes, or even half an
   hour.
<P>
   Possible Solutions
   ------------------
<P>
   a. Close the dependent sheet first.
<P>
   b. From the Options menu, choose Calculation and cancel the
<P><PRE>      selection of Save External Link Values.
</PRE><P>
   c. Reduce the number of external links.
