<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you save your workbook as an HTML document, some of the cell formatting
may not be saved with the workbook.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
If you use the Conditional Formatting feature to apply formats to cells,
the formatting is not saved with your workbook when you save it as an HTML
document.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Currently, there is no way to save your workbook as an HTML document and
have it preserve the formatting created by the Conditional Formatting
feature.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Internet Assistant Wizard is not new to Microsoft Excel, but it has
changed significantly since it was released as a free add-in available on
the Microsoft World Wide Web site in January 1996. The Internet Assistant
Wizard is now an installable component of Microsoft Office and/or Microsoft
Excel, and has been enhanced to take advantage of the new Internet features
of Microsoft Office, Microsoft FrontPage, and Microsoft Internet Explorer.
<P>
With the Internet Assistant Wizard, you can leverage existing Microsoft
Excel spreadsheet data to create and distribute documents that can be
viewed online with a Web browser, such as Microsoft Internet Explorer. By
clicking a series of buttons in the wizard, you can convert spreadsheet
data to HTML format, either as a separate Web document or into an existing
Web document.
