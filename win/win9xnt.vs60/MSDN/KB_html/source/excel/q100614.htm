The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 4.0, 4.0a, 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you automatically load an add-in macro sheet, the add-in may appear to 
fail to load. All of the add-in custom functions appear in the Formula 
Paste Function dialog box, but none of its custom menu commands appear.
<P>
The primary method for automatically loading a document when you start
Microsoft Excel is to place the file in your startup directory:

<UL><LI>XLSTART directory (for Microsoft Excel for Windows) 
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE>
<LI>Excel Startup Folder (4) (for Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh).
<P>
</UL>Or, you can use an OPEN= statement in the settings file: EXCEL4.INI file 
(Excel 4.0 for Windows), EXCEL5.INI file (Excel 5.0 for Windows), or Excel 
Settings (4) file (Excel 4.0 for the Macintosh).
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when the name __DemandLoad is defined in the add-in 
sheet and either of the following is true:

<UL><LI>The add-in macro sheet is located in the startup directory
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE>
<LI>The add-in macro is set to load in the settings file by using an OPEN=
   statement that contains the /F switch.
<P>
</UL>NOTE: this information applies to Microsoft Excel 5.0 only when you use the 
version 4.0 macro language.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When the name __DemandLoad (note that the string "DemandLoad" is preceded
by two underscores) is defined on the add-in macro sheet, the add-in file
is not actually loaded until you open it from the Open dialog box or until 
one of its custom functions is entered into a sheet or is recalculated.
In essence, the add-in is loaded into memory upon demand. This saves time 
and memory when you start Microsoft Excel.
<P>
Because the add-in macro is not loaded, any auto open macros that add
custom menu commands or run other command macros are not executed. Only
custom functions are added when __DemandLoad is defined on your sheet. If
your add-in macro sheet contains both types of macros, you can remove the
defined name __DemandLoad from your add-in sheet and save it to your
startup directory. When you start Microsoft Excel, this loads the add-in, 
executes any auto open macros, and adds custom functions to the Paste
Function dialog box.
<P>
Alternatively, if you want the add-in macro to load on demand when one of
its custom functions or custom menu commands is called, in addition to
__DemandLoad, add the defined names __Command and/or __Menu, to your add-in
sheet and then use the Add-in Manager to add your add-in to the startup
list contained in your EXCEL4.INI file (Windows) or Excel Settings (4) file
(Macintosh). The Add-in Manager checks for these defined names and performs
the specified action.
<P>
<P><h3>__DemandLoad</h3>
 
<P>
When this name is defined on the add-in sheet, the Add-in Manager adds an
OPEN= line with the /F switch to the Microsoft Excel section in your
settings file. The OPEN= line contains the path and name of your add-in
macro. /F is a fast load option switch that, when used in conjunction with
a file containing the defined name __DemandLoad, places all of the custom
functions in the Paste Function dialog box. Note that if the add-in macro
sheet does not contain the defined name, the add-in file is fully loaded 
when you start Microsoft Excel.
<P>
The definition for __DemandLoad is not important. In the add-ins that are 
built into Microsoft Excel, it is commonly defined as the Boolean value, 
TRUE. When defined as FALSE, however, it functions the same.
<P>
<P><h3>__Command</h3>
 
<P>
When this name is defined on the add-in sheet, the Add-in Manager adds your
custom commands to specified menus when you start Microsoft Excel. Similar
to __DemandLoad, the add-in macro sheet is not actually loaded until you
select one of the commands. This saves time and memory when you start 
Microsoft Excel.
<P>
The Add-in Manager adds the information necessary to add the custom menu
commands to the Init Commands section of your settings file. __Command must
refer to a horizontal array that contains the following information (only 
the first 4 are required):
<P>
<PRE>   &lt;Menu_Bar_Num&gt;  Menu bar number
   &lt;Menu Name&gt;     Menu the command should be added to
   &lt;Command Name&gt;  Name of the command to be added
   &lt;Macro text&gt;    Name of the macro to run when command is selected
   &lt;Position&gt;      Position of command on the menu
   &lt;Key&gt;           Macro shortcut key
   &lt;Status&gt;        Message to be displayed on the Status bar
   &lt;Help&gt;          Help topic number

</PRE>The array can be a cell range or an array formula. Assume your add-in
contains a SalesRpt macro that runs when you select Create Report from the
Options menu. You can enter the following information in cells and define
__Command as =$B$1:$E$1 (in the Refers To box),
<P>
<PRE>    B1: 1   C1: Options   D1: Create Report   E1: SalesRpt

-or-

</PRE>you can use an array formula as follows:
<P>
<PRE>    ={1,"Options","Create Report","SalesRpt"}

</PRE>If you have more than one custom command to add, use sequential names
beginning with __Command, then __Command1, __Command2, and so on.
<P>
<P><h3>__Menu</h3>
 
<P>
Use this defined name when your add-in creates a custom menu. The Add-in
Manager adds the information necessary to add the custom menu to the Init
Menus section of your settings file. Like the definition for __Command,
__Menu must refer to a horizontal cell range or array formula containing
the following information:
<P>
<PRE>    &lt;Menu_Bar_Num&gt;  Number of the bar you want to add the menu to
    &lt;New Menu&gt;      The name of your menu
    &lt;Position&gt;      Position of the menu on the bar

</PRE>Again, if you have more than one custom menu to add, use sequential names
beginning with __Menu, __Menu1, __Menu2, and so on.
