The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, versions 5.0, 5.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, when you click Find File on the File menu to search for
a specific file or type of file, you receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   There is not enough available memory to complete that operation

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs if you are running Microsoft Excel for the Power
Macintosh on an Apple Power Macintosh, and you use the Find File
dialog box to copy a file to a different directory, and you then
delete the file that you copied.
<P>
For example, if you copy the file TEMP.XLS to a new Untitled Folder using
the Find File dialog box, and you then use the Find File dialog box to
delete the file TEMP.XLS, the next time you click Find File on the File
menu, you receive the "out of memory" error message.
<P>
Note that this behavior does not occur if you copy and delete the file in
different Find File sessions; that is, if you close Find File after you
copy the file, and then use Find File again to delete the file.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, when you receive this error message, delete
the Search Results 00 file, located in the 'System Folder:Preferences:
Microsoft Find File' folder, and then click Find File on the File menu in
Microsoft Excel.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. The problem was corrected in
Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition.
