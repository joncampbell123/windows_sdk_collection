               Automated Product Support Service Fax-Script
                       Questions and Answers: Setup
               --------------------------------------------

1. Q. During Excel for the Macintosh custom installation, I am given
      the opportunity to choose which Excel options I want to install.
      What are each of these options and why should I install them?

   A. There are 10 options you may choose from during a custom
      installation of Microsoft Excel version 4.0 for the Macintosh. A
      full setup will take approximately 8.6 megabytes (MB) of disk
      space. The following is an overview of the 10 available options:

      Microsoft Excel:

         This option installs the minimum files necessary for using
         Microsoft Excel 4.0. If you are installing Microsoft Excel
         4.0 for the first time, you must turn on the Microsoft Excel
         option.

      Macro Library:

         Selecting this option installs add-in macros that provide
         enhanced functionality in Excel. Examples of these add-ins
         are an Auto Save macro, a Flat File export macro, and a
         Worksheet Auditor macro.

      Microsoft Excel Help:

         Selecting this option installs the Microsoft Help engine,
         along with Excel for the Macintosh Help and PSS Help. These
         files contain online documentation as well as additional
         documentation for the Macro Library and Examples folders.

      Microsoft Excel Tutorial:

         Choosing this option installs a series of online lessons that
         provide an excellent way to interactively learn Microsoft
         Excel 4.0. To run the tutorial, you must have HyperCard
         version 1.2.5 or later installed on your machine. You should
         have received a copy of HyperCard with your Macintosh. If you
         did not, contact your authorized Apple dealer.

      Dialog Editor:

         Choosing this option installs the Dialog Editor application.
         You use the Dialog Editor to create dialog boxes for
         Microsoft Excel command macros as well as custom forms for
         entering database information.

      Examples:

         Selecting this option installs a set of sample worksheets that
         offer ideas on how to combine Microsoft Excel features to
         create powerful worksheets, macros, and models.

      Analysis ToolPak:

         This option adds financial and engineering functions and
         provides tools for performing statistical and engineering
         analysis procedures.

      Microsoft Excel Solver:

         Choosing this option installs Microsoft Excel Solver, an
         easy-to-use add-in that allows you to get better answers out
         of the same worksheet you built to ask "what-if" questions.

      Microsoft Excel Crosstab ReportWizard:

         This option installs the Crosstab ReportWizard, which allows
         you to calculate, analyze, and compare information contained
         in a database.

      Data Access:

         This option installs the necessary files to use the Data
         Access Manager of System Software 7 to access a Data Access
         Language server. Apple sells a Data Access Server, which
         allows SQL-like queries to databases that reside on mainframe
         computers. For more information on Apple's Data Access
         Server, contact your local Apple dealer.

2. Q. Whenever I place one of the Excel for the Macintosh 4.0 disks
      into my computer, I get a message asking if I want to initialize
      my disk. What's wrong?

   A. If you receive this message when you place any of the original
      master disks into your Macintosh, you have probably received a
      damaged set of disks. To make certain that the disks are damaged
      and that the problem is not caused by something else, try these
      other options:

      a. If you are running your Macintosh with System Software
         version 7.0 or later, restart your Macintosh and hold down
         the SHIFT key as it boots. You should see the message
         "Welcome to Macintosh, Extensions Off." If you are running
         System Software version 6, remove any non-Apple Chooser,
         Control Panel, and Startup documents from your System Folder,
         and restart your Macintosh. Attempt to use the Excel for the
         Macintosh version 4.0 disks. If you do NOT get the
         initialization message and everything proceeds fine, you may
         have had an extension conflict. Under System 7, extensions
         are stored in the Control Panels folder and the Extensions
         folder, which reside in the System Folder. Examine the files
         in these folders for non-Apple files, and check with the
         manufacturer of the software to make certain it is System-7
         compliant. Under System 6, examine the files you removed from
         the System Folder, and make certain that they are System-6
         compatible by checking with the manufacturer. If you did get
         the same initialization message, try the next option.

      b. If the first suggestion did not work, try using the disks on
         another Macintosh. If the disks work on another Macintosh,
         you may be having problems with the disk drive on your
         Macintosh. Have an authorized Apple dealer check your drive
         for alignment or other problems.

      c. If the disks do not work on another Macintosh, then you most
         likely have received bad disks. Contact Microsoft Sales and
         Service at (800) 426-9400 and select End User Sales for a
         replacement set of disks.
