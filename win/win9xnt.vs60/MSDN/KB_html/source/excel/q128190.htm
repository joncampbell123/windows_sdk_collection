The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, versions 5.0, 5.0a
<LI>Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, when you open a file that is located on a Novell
server, you may receive the following error message even if the file is
not open in another instance of Microsoft Excel or on another computer
<P>
<PRE>   &lt;File&gt; is being modified by &lt;username&gt;

   Open as Read-Only, or choose Notify to be alerted when it is available

</PRE>where &lt;File&gt; is the name of the file that you are opening, and &lt;username&gt;
is the name of the last user who opened the file as read/write.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When you open a file on a Novell server that has Macintosh services, if the
file is marked read-Ooly, you receive the error message even if the file is
not open in another instance of Microsoft Excel. This behavior also occurs
when you open a file located on a Novell network server if the file is
locked at the Finder level, or if you don't have Write privileges to the
network share.
<P>
Under these conditions, you should receive a message indicating that the
file is locked or that it must be opened as read-only instead of a message
indicating that it is being modified.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
To open a file located on a Novell network server under these conditions,
select the Read Only check box in the Open dialog box when you open the
file.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Novell networks are manufactured by Novell, a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this
product's performance or reliability.
