<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, when you create an external link by assigning a
macro in one workbook to a button in another workbook, and you use
the ChangeLink method to change the source of the link, you receive
the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Run-time error '1004':

   ChangeLink method of Workbook class failed.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs when the procedure that uses the ChangeLink
method is located in the workbook that contains the button. The
problem only occurs when the workbook that contains the button is the
active document, and the workbook that contains the linked procedure
is open but has not been activated since it was last saved.
<P>
Consider the following example: The workbook ONE.XLS contains a
procedure that is assigned to a button in TWO.XLS. The workbook
TWO.XLS contains a procedure that uses the ChangeLink method to
change the link to the button from ONE.XLS to another workbook. You
receive the error message above if you save ONE.XLS, activate TWO.XLS
and run the procedure to change the link.
<P>
Note that this problem does not occur when you use the ChangeLink
method to change a link to a MS Excel 4.0 macro, or to a cell in
another workbook.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
To avoid receiving this error message, do any of the following:

<UL><LI>Manually change the link to the button using the Links dialog box.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Close or activate the workbook that contains the linked procedure before
   you run the macro to change the link.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Display either the Assign Macro dialog box, or the Macro dialog box
   before you run the macro to change the link.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in
Microsoft Excel version 5.0c for Windows.
