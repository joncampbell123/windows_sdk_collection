The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition, when you select a value in a
validation drop-down list box, you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   The cell or chart you are trying to change is protected and therefore
   read-only.

</PRE>You are unable to select a value in the list.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This will occur if all of the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>The validation drop-down list does not refer to a range of cells
   for its values, but instead contains the values directly.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>The cell containing the validation drop-down list is locked.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>The worksheet containing the cell is protected.
<P>
</UL><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
There are two possible workarounds for this problem: you can either unlock
the cell that contains the validation drop-down list box, or you can set
the validation drop-down list so that it refers to a range of cells, rather
than directly containing its own values.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1: Unlock the Cell Containing the Drop-Down List Box</h3>
 
<P>
To unlock the cell containing the drop-down list box, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>If the worksheet in question is currently protected, click the
   Tools menu, point to Protection, and click Unprotect Sheet. If you are
   prompted for a password, enter it and click OK.

<P><LI>Select the cell that contains the validation drop-down list.
   On the Format menu, click Cells.

<P><LI>Select the Protection tab.

<P><LI>Clear the Locked check box and click OK.

<P><LI>Repeat steps 2-4 for any other cells in your worksheet that
   contain validation drop-down boxes.

<P><LI>Once all necessary cells have been unlocked, restore the protection on
   your worksheet. Point to Protection on the Tools menu, and click Protect
   Sheet (enter a password if necessary).
<P>
</OL><h3>Method 2: Make Your List Refer to a Range of Cells</h3>
 
<P>
When you create a validation list box, you can either input a list of
values
<P>
<PRE>   One, Two, Three, Four

</PRE></OL>or, you can set the list box to refer to a range of cells for its values:
<P>
<PRE>   A1: One
   A2: Two
   A3: Three
   A4: Four

</PRE>If you create a validation list using this second method, you will avoid
problems when you use the list on a protected worksheet.
<P>
To create a validation list that refers to a range of cells for its values,
follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Select the cell that is to contain a validation drop-down list box.

<P><LI>On the Data menu, click Validation.

<P><LI>Click the Settings tab.

<P><LI>In the Allow box, click "List." Click in the Source box, and then either
   use the mouse to select a range on the worksheet, or enter the range
   manually. The resulting entry in the Source box should resemble the
   following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      =$A$1:$A$4
</PRE>
<P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
</OL>The new validation list box will work correctly, even if the worksheet is
protected.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition includes a new feature called
validation. You can use validation to make sure that users only enter
specific values, or specific types of values, into cells in Microsoft
Excel.
<P>
One validation option allows you to attach a drop-down list box to a cell
when the cell is selected. If you use this option, users can only enter
values in the cell that are contained within the list box. The list box can
obtain its values from one of two sources: the list box can refer to a
range of cells for its values, or it can contain them directly.
<P>
To create a validation drop-down list box that directly contains its own
values, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Select the cell that is to contain a validation drop-down list box.

<P><LI>On the Data menu, click Validation.

<P><LI>Click the Settings tab.

<P><LI>In the Allow box, click "List." In the Source box, type a list of
   values, separated by commas. For example, type:
<P>
<P><PRE>      One, Two, Three, Four
</PRE>
<P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
</OL>When you select the cell, the drop-down list box appears, and you can
select a value from the list. You cannot manually type a value into the
cell.
