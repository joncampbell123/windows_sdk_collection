<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel for Windows, you may be unable to add references to
two different files when the names of the files are identical except for
the presence of accent marks on certain characters in the filenames.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs because the Visual Basic Programming System,
Applications Edition, is sometimes "accent-insensitive." When filenames
contain accented characters, such as "e" (acute accent), "e" (circumflex
accent), or "i" (grave accent), the characters may be "remapped" to a non-
accented character, such as plain "e" or "i."
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To prevent this error from occurring, make sure your filenames differ
by more than accents before you attempt to add references to them.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If you attempt to add a reference to a file named "RESUME.XLS" (where the
"E" characters have acute accents) when a reference to a file named
"RESUME.XLS" (standard English/American "E" characters) already exists, you
may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Name conflicts with existing module, project, or object library

</PRE>This problem may occur whenever filenames include accented characters. For
example, "e" (acute accent), "e" (grave accent), "e" (circumflex accent),
and plain "e" are all considered to be the same character when you are
adding references.
