<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you have a chart embedded on a chart sheet, you may not be able to view
a sample of the embedded chart in the Chart Type dialog box.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
If you have a chart sheet with a second chart embedded on it, you can
preview only one of the charts in the Chart Type dialog box. The chart that
is currently selected is the one that appears when you click "Press and
hold to view sample" in the Chart Type dialog box.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To be able to view a sample (in the Chart Type dialog box) of either chart
on the chart sheet, you must first select the desired chart.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Excel 97 includes a new feature that allows you to preview a
sample of your chart while you make changes to the chart. If you already
have a chart created, you can select the chart and then click Chart Type on
the Chart menu. In the Chart Type dialog box, you can change the type of
chart you have created and then click "Press and hold to view sample" to
see what your chart will look like with the changes you have made. If you
like the changes, click OK to accept them. If you do not like the changes,
you can either make different changes, or you can click Cancel to revert to
your original chart.
