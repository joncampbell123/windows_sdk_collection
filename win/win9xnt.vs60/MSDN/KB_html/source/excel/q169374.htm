The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you try to view a Visual Basic for Applications project in the Microsoft
Visual Basic Editor, you may receive the following error message
<P>
<PRE>   Project Locked
   Project is unviewable

</PRE>even though you did not lock the project for viewing in the properties for
the project. You may also receive this message if you click VBAProject
Properties on the Tools menu in the Microsoft Visual Basic Editor.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs if you try to view a project that is in a shared
workbook.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
You cannot view a project in a shared workbook. If you want to view a
project in a shared workbook, disable sharing. To disable sharing, use the
following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Open the shared workbook.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Share Workbook.

<P><LI>Click to clear "Allow changes by more than one user at the same time"
   and click OK.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This is by design of Microsoft Excel 97.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Some features in Microsoft Excel 97 are not available when you use a shared
workbook. In a shared workbook, you cannot write, change view, record, or
assign macros. However, you can record a macro that is stored in another
workbook that is not shared. You can run macros that were created before
the workbook was shared; however, if you run a macro that includes an
operation that is unavailable, the macro stops at that point.
<P>
<P><h2>REFERENCES</h2>
 
<P>
For more information about limitations using shared workbooks, click the
Index tab in Microsoft Excel 97 Help, type the following text
<P>
<PRE>   shared workbooks, limitations

</PRE></OL>and then double-click the selected text to go to the "Limitations of shared
workbooks" topic.
