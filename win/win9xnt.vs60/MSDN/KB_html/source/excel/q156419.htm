The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you point to Toolbars on the View menu, and then click Customize, the
WorkGroup toolbar is not listed in the list of default toolbars.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Excel 97 does not include a WorkGroup toolbar. Although the
WorkGroup toolbar is not included with Microsoft Excel 97, all of the
commands are still available.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this behavior, create a new toolbar that contains all of the
same toolbar buttons as the Microsoft Excel 5.0 and 7.0 WorkGroup toolbar.
To build your own custom WorkGroup toolbar in Microsoft Excel 97, use the
following steps:
<P>
<PRE>    1. On the View menu, point to Toolbars, and click Customize.

    2. Click the Toolbars tab.

    3. Click New. Type "WorkGroup" (without the quotation marks) and click
       OK.

       A new toolbar called WorkGroup appears.

    4. Click the Commands tab.

    5. In the list of Categories, click File.

       The list of Commands contains the following five icons:

       Open          Routing Slip       Mail Recipient
       Update File   Toggle Read Only

    6. Scroll to each icon in the list of Commands and drag each icon from
       the list of Commands onto the WorkGroup toolbar. (When you are done,
       the WorkGroup toolbar should contain five buttons.)

    7. In the list of Categories, click Tools.

    8. Scroll down the list of Commands until you see Scenario. (There
       should be a picture of a list box to the right of the word.)

    9. Drag the Scenario list box from the list of Commands onto the
       WorkGroup toolbar.

   10. Click Close.

</PRE>You should now have a WorkGroup toolbar that is functionally equivalent to
the Microsoft Excel 5.0 and 7.0 WorkGroup toolbar. Note that the Open
button on this toolbar is functionally identical to the Find File button on
the Excel 5.0 and 7.0 WorkGroup toolbar.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The WorkGroup toolbar in Microsoft Excel 5.0 and 7.0 is designed to help
you and several other users work with a file. The toolbar includes buttons
that allow you to search for files, send files to other users through e-
mail, change and update read-only files, and use scenarios to work with
multiple sets of data within a single worksheet.
