The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you attempt to add a new chart to a workbook in Microsoft Excel
97, you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Not enough memory.

</PRE>If you are using a Visual Basic for Applications macro to add chart sheets
to a workbook, you may also receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Run-time error '1004':
   Method 'Add' of object 'Sheets' failed

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may occur if you add more than 124 charts to a workbook when
editing the workbook in Microsoft Excel 97.
<P>
Note that the limit of charts in the workbook may actually be fewer than
124, especially if you use multiple fonts in worksheets in your workbook
or if you use embedded charts. Also, note that if the workbook contains 
charts that were added in earlier versions of Microsoft Excel, the 
workbook may contain more than 124 charts.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
You may be able to work around this limitation by turning off the Auto
Scale option for fonts in your charts. To do this:

<OL><P><LI>Select the chart area.

<P><LI>On the Format menu, click Selected Chart Area.

<P><LI>Select the Font tab.

<P><LI>Clear (uncheck) the "Auto scale" checkbox.

<P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
</OL>You may also be able to work around this limitation by moving some of the
charts in your workbook into another workbook. Charts moved to another
workbook will remain linked to the data in the original workbook.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 97, there is a limit of 256 fonts that may be used by
the program. When you create a chart, the chart uses two fonts if
the Auto Scale feature for that chart is enabled (this is the default
behavior in Microsoft Excel 97). So, it is possible to exceed the limit of
fonts by creating a workbook that contains the following objects:
<P>
<PRE>   Objects                      Fonts per Object   Total Fonts Used
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   124 chart objects            2 fonts                   248 fonts
   1 worksheet                  1 font                      1 font
   used by Microsoft Excel 97   6 fonts                     6 fonts
                                                  -----------------
                                                   Total  255 fonts

</PRE></OL>If you attempt to add a 125th chart to the workbook, the total number
of fonts used would be 257. Because this would exceed the limit of 256
fonts, you receive a "Not enough memory" error message.
<P>
Turning off the Auto Scale feature for each chart may allow you to extend
the maximum number of charts that may be added to the workbook.
