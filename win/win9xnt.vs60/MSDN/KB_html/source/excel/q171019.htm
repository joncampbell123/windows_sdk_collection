The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you quit Microsoft Excel 97, you may receive the following error
message:
<P>
<PRE>   This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down.
   If the problem persists, contact the program vendor.

</PRE>If you click Details, you receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   EXCEL caused an invalid page fault in module EXCEL.EXE at
   0137:30295ab2.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may occur if you create a circular reference between two
separate instances of Microsoft Excel 97, and then attempt to quit both
instances.
<P>
NOTE: This problem does not occur in earlier versions of Microsoft Excel.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this problem, avoid creating circular references between cells
in worksheets in different instances of Microsoft Excel 97.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, a circular reference is formed when a cell refers to
itself through one or more other cells. For example, both of the following
sets of formulas create circular references
<P>
<PRE>   A1: =B1      E1: =F1
   B1: =A1      F1: =G1+K2
                G1: =E1

</PRE>because at least one of the cells refers to itself through other cells.
<P>
Microsoft Excel warns you if you create a circular reference, either by
displaying a dialog box or by displaying a message in the status bar.
<P>
However, if you create a circular reference between cells in different
instances of Microsoft Excel, you are not warned about the presence of the
circular reference. Also, depending on the way you quit Microsoft Excel 97,
you may receive an invalid page fault when you close the second instance of
Microsoft Excel 97.
