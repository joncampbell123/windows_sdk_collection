The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, versions 7.0, 7.0a
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0c
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, when you open a Lotus 1-2-3 WK4 file, you may receive
one of following error messages:
<P>
<PRE>   This document contains formulas which failed to convert

   -or-

   Cannot read cell &lt;&lt;cell address&gt;&gt;. Continue reporting each error?

</PRE>In Microsoft Excel 97, when you click OK in the error message box, cells on
the worksheet that contain a formula that did not convert contain a cell
Comment denoted by a red mark in the upper-right corner of the cell. The
Comment displays the message
<P>
<PRE>   Formula failed to convert

</PRE>and the cell contains the value of the formula when it was last saved.
<P>
In Microsoft Excel version 7.0 and earlier, when you click OK in the error
message box, cells on the worksheet that contain a formula that did not
convert contain the #VALUE! error value, and a cell note indicator.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs because not all of the formulas available in Lotus 1-
2-3 are supported when you open a Lotus 1-2-3 file in Microsoft Excel. Some
of the formulas must be created again in Microsoft Excel. The following
list is an example of some of the formulas that are available in Lotus 1-2-
3 that are not converted when you open a Lotus 1-2-3 file in Microsoft
Excel:
<P>
<PRE>   @ACCRUED
   @ASEC
   @BETA
   @DATEINFO
   @PRODUCT (only Microsoft Excel versions 5.0 and 7.0)

</PRE>Note that when you open a Lotus 1-2-3 WK3 file, you receive an error
message for each cell that contains a formula that cannot be converted.
Additionally, when you open the file, the cells that contain formulas that
were not converted contain the original value for the formula.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To locate each cell on the worksheet that contains a formula that was not
converted do the following.
<P>
<P><h3>In Microsoft Excel 97</h3>
 
<P>
On the View menu, click Comments. Every cell that contains a cell Comment
will show a tip displaying the text of the Comment.
<P>
In Microsoft Excel version 7.0 and earlier
--- --------------------------------------
<P>
On the Insert menu, click Note. The Notes In Sheet list contains the
references of the cells that contain formulas that were not converted--the
notes will contain the text "Formula failed to convert."
