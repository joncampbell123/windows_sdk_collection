The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition
<LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, versions 7.0, 7.0a
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0c
<LI>Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, versions 5.0, 5.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, you may receive a macro error when you use the XLCALL
function in a Lotus 1-2-3 macro to call a Microsoft Excel Visual Basic for
Applications module that contains the SaveAs function.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
You receive an error at the cell that contains the XLCALL function if the
Microsoft Excel macro that is called contains a SaveAs command, and either
of the following conditions occurs:

<UL><LI>The SaveAs command saves the workbook that contains the XLCALL under
   a different name.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE>
<LI>The SaveAs command saves another workbook.
<P>
</UL>The Microsoft Excel procedure that is called is executed; but when it
returns control to the XLCALL function, an error occurs.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1</h3>
 
<P>
If the SaveAs command saves the workbook that contains the XLCALL function
under a different name, modify the SaveAs function so that the module saves
the workbook containing the XLCALL function under the same name.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 2</h3>

<PRE>   <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/supportnet/refguide/">http://www.microsoft.com/supportnet/refguide/</A></B>

</PRE>If the SaveAs command saves another workbook, switch to the workbook and
worksheet that contains the {XLCALL} function before it leaves the sub
procedure. The following procedure, which is called from Test.xls, opens a
new workbook and saves it as Book.xls. It then switches to the worksheet in
which the XLCALL command is located (Test.xls).
<P>
<PRE>   Sub SheetSave()
       'Open new workbook
       Workbooks.Add

       'Save new workbook as Book.xls
       ActiveWorkbook.SaveAs FileName:="Book.xls", FileFormat:=xlNormal

       'Activate Test.xls, which is where the XLCALL
       'command is located
       Workbooks("Test.xls").Activate
       Worksheets("A").Activate
   End Sub

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post more information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The XLCALL command is used to call a Microsoft Excel macro or module from a
Lotus 1-2-3 macro. The syntax for this command is as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   {XLCALL macro_name}

</PRE>Where macro_name is the name of the Microsoft Excel macro being called. For
example, this will run a Visual Basic for Applications macro called Macro1
located in Module1 of the active workbook.
<P>
<PRE>   {XLCALL Module1.Macro1}
