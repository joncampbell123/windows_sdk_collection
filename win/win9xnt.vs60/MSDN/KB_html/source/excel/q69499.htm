<P><h3>Background</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft Excel version 3.00 for Windows no longer offers internal
support for the use of custom Help files in the text (ASCII) format.
Instead, Microsoft Excel 3.00 for Windows uses the Windows 3.00 Help
engine for custom Help. The Windows 3.00 Help engine requires Help
files in the Help-file format.
<P>
By using the Windows 3.00 Help engine, you can create powerful custom
Help for your Microsoft Excel applications. You can set jump topics
and glossary items and take advantage of the Help-window interface. It
is recommended that you use the Windows 3.00 Software Development Kit
(SDK) for extensive Help file development.
<P>
<P><h3>About This Utility</h3>
 
<P>
If you've created custom Help files in Microsoft Excel version 2.00 or
2.10 for Windows, you can use the Microsoft Excel Custom Help File
Conversion Utility to convert your text files into Help-format files
so they can be accessed by Microsoft Excel 3.00.
<P>
This utility consists of two files: HELPCONV.EXE and HC.EXE.
HELPCONV.EXE  is the conversion utility. HC.EXE is the Help compiler,
which is needed for the conversion process (HC.EXE is also available
in the Windows 3.00 SDK).
<P>
To convert a text-format file to a Help-format file, run HELPCONV.EXE.
This program converts the text file to a rich text format (.RTF) file
and creates a Help project (.HPJ) file. Then HELPCONV.EXE calls
HC.EXE, which uses the .HPJ file to compile the .RTF file into a Help-
format file. The Help-format file is given the name of your original
text-format file, and your original text file is saved with the
extension .BAK. The intermediate files are deleted.
<P>
<P><h3>To Run This Utility</h3>
 
<P>
You can run the Microsoft Excel Custom Help File Conversion
Utility from the DOS prompt, or you can choose Run from the File
menu in the Program Manager. If you want to run the program from
the DOS prompt, make sure you have set a path to HELPCONV.EXE and
HC.EXE, or that the files reside in the current directory.
<P>
The form of the DOS command is as follows
<P>
<PRE>  HELPCONV &lt;filename&gt; [/T "help_title_text"] [/U] [/L] [/D]

</PRE>where
<P>
<PRE>  [ ] indicates an optional parameter

</PRE>Please note that there is a space between each parameter on the
command line and that you should include the drive and pathname of
HELPCONV.EXE if you are running the command from the Program Manager.
<P>
<PRE>Parameter             Description
---------             -----------

&lt;filename&gt;            The DOS filename, including extension, of the
                      text-format file you want to convert

</PRE>/T "help_title_text"  Required to insert the Help-window title (will
<PRE>                      default to "Excel Macro" if no  entry is made)

/U                    An optional switch to prevent HC.EXE from being
                      executed

/L                    An optional switch to prevent deletion of
                      intermediate .RTF and .HPJ files

/D                    An optional switch to delete the .BAK file when
                      finished


</PRE>For example, assume you want to convert the Excel 2.10 Help file
"MACROHLP.TXT", and you want to delete the .BAK file when finished.
The command line should appear as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   HELPCONV MACROHLP.TXT /T "Sample Macro" /D

</PRE>In this example, you will have a Help-format file with the title
"Sample Macro" and with the same name as your original text-format
file; thus, you will not need to make any changes to your macro sheet.
