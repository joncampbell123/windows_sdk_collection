The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 4.0, 4.0a, 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, versions 4.0, 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, you can customize the toolbars and the arrangement of
displayed toolbars and save your custom configurations in separate files.
You can easily change from one configuration to another and you can merge
these configuration files to create new toolbar arrangements.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Excel provides a set of built-in toolbars, and allows you to
create your own custom toolbars. The toolbar configuration, that is, the
arrangement of visible toolbars when Microsoft Excel is running, is saved
in a file called EXCEL.XLB in version 4.0, EXCEL5.XLB in version 5.0, and
EXCEL TOOLBARS on the Macintosh, when you exit the program.
<P>
In Microsoft Excel for Windows, the EXCEL.XLB or EXCEL5.XLB file is located
in the directory in which you installed Windows. On the Macintosh, the
EXCEL TOOLBARS file is located in the System folder (System 7 puts the
toolbar file in the Preferences folder within the System folder).
<P>
Note: Saving and merging toolbar configurations involves changing the name
of the toolbar file. For information on renaming your toolbar file, see the
section below titled, "To change the name of your toolbar file."
<P>
<P><h3>To Save Custom Toolbar Configurations</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Rename your toolbar file to any name you choose.

<P><LI>With Microsoft Excel running, create a toolbar configuration that you
   want to save.
<P>
   For more information on working with toolbars see, "User's Guide 2,"
   version 4.0, pages 154-165; "User's Guide," version 5.0, pages 637-638.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Exit (Quit on the Macintosh) to exit
   Excel.

<P><LI>Excel saves your toolbar configuration in the EXCEL.XLB file (EXCEL
   TOOLBARS on the Macintosh). To keep this configuration for later
   use, change the name of this file. Using a name that is descriptive
   of the configuration helps you to associate the file with the
   toolbar arrangement it contains.

<P><LI>Repeat steps 2 through 4 to create as many custom toolbar files as
   you want.
<P>
</OL>Note: You can move a custom toolbar into your startup directory and it
automatically loads every time you start Microsoft Excel. In Windows, the
startup directory is called XLSTART and is located in your Excel directory.
On the Macintosh, the startup folder is called PREFERENCES in System 7, and
EXCEL STARTUP FOLDER in System 6.0 and earlier. In both cases on the
Macintosh, the startup folder is located in your SYSTEM folder.
<P>
To Open a Custom Toolbar File
 
<P>
In Excel for Windows:

<OL><P><LI>From the File menu, choose Open.

<P><LI>In the Open dialog box, select the directory where you installed
   Windows from the Directories list.

<P><LI>In the Open dialog box, select the toolbar file (.XLB file) you
   want to open and choose the OK button.
<P>
</OL>In Excel for the Macintosh:

<OL><P><LI>From the File menu, choose Open.

<P><LI>In the Open Document dialog box, change to the Preferences folder
   within the System folder.

<P><LI>Select the toolbar file you want to open and choose the Open
   button.
<P>
</OL><h3>To Merge Toolbar Files</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Open all of the toolbar files you want to merge.

<P><LI>Arrange your toolbars to your liking.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Exit (Quit on the Macintosh).
<P>
</OL>When you exit Excel, your current toolbar configuration is saved as
EXCEL.XLB in Windows or EXCEL TOOLBARS on the Macintosh. In
this case, your current configuration is a combination of the
configurations in the toolbar files you opened.
<P>
<P><h3>To Change the Name of Your Toolbar File</h3>
 
<P>
In Windows:

<OL><P><LI>In Windows File Manager, select the directory in which you
   installed windows.

<P><LI>Locate the EXCEL.XLB file and select it.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Rename.

<P><LI>In the Rename dialog box, type the new filename in the To box.

<P><LI>Choose the OK button.
<P>
</OL>On the Macintosh:

<OL><P><LI>Open the PREFERENCES folder located in your SYSTEM folder.
<P>
   Note: With System versions prior to System 7, just open the SYSTEM
   Folder.

<P><LI>Locate the EXCEL TOOLBARS file.

<P><LI>Highlight the name (EXCEL TOOLBARS) and type in your new name.
<P></OL>
