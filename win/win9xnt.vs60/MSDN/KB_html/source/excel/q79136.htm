<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
A FOR.CELL loop repeats instructions over a range of cells, one cell
at a time. However, the active cell does not move during the loop's
execution. This may cause problems if you have instructions within the
body of the loop that operate on the active cell.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The first argument to the FOR.CELL command is ref_name. This is a name
in the form of text that refers to the n-th cell in the selection upon
the n-th pass through the loop. The example shown below will replace
the contents of the active cell with the cubed root of the current
value of the active cell:
<P>
<PRE>   A1: CubeRoot
   A2: =FOR.CELL("CurrentCell")
   A3: =FORMULA(CurrentCell^(1/3))
   A4: =NEXT()
   A5: =RETURN()

</PRE>Because the reference argument is omitted from the FORMULA function,
it defaults to the active cell. However, because the active cell is
not moved in a FOR.CELL loop, the only cell that gets operated on is
the cell that is active before the loop is executed.
<P>
To cause a FOR.CELL loop's operation to be applied to each cell in the
selection, you must either use a SELECT statement to change the active
cell, or specify a reference if the operation to be applied will
accept a reference as an argument.
<P>
<P><h3>Example</h3>
 
<P>
In the example shown below, the FORMULA function is given the name
CurrentCell as its reference argument. This works properly.
<P>
<PRE>   A1: CubeRoot
   A2: =FOR.CELL("CurrentCell")
   A3: =FORMULA(CurrentCell^(1/3),CurrentCell)
   A4: =NEXT()
   A5: =RETURN()

</PRE>If a command such as FORMAT.FONT is used within the body of the loop,
you must first execute a SELECT statement because FORMAT.FONT doesn't
accept a reference as an argument. For example:
<P>
<PRE>   A1: =FOR.CELL("Current")
   A2: =SELECT(Current)
   A3: =FORMAT.FONT(2)
   A4: =NEXT()
   A5: =RETURN()
