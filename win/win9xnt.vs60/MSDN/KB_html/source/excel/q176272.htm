<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you save a file in Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition, you may
receive one of the following error messages:
<P>
<PRE>   " cannot be accessed. The file may be read-only, or you might be trying
   to access a read-only location. Or, the server the document is stored on
   may not be responding.

   -or-

   Microsoft Excel cannot access the file '&lt;Long Path Name&gt;'.
   There are several possible reasons:

   - The file name or path name does not exist.
   - The file you're trying to open is being used by another program. Close
     the document in the other program, and try again.
   - The name of the workbook you're trying to save is the same as another
     document that is read-only. Try saving the workbook as a different
     name.

   -or-

   Document not saved.

   -or-

   '&lt;Filename&gt;' could not be found. Check the spelling of the file name,
   and verify that the file location is correct

   If you are trying to open the file from your list of most recently used
   files on the File menu, make sure that the file has not been renamed,
   moved, or deleted.

</PRE>When you click OK, you receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Document saved successfully. Cannot reopen the saved document due to low
   memory. Please close the document.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may occur when the path to the folder in which you are saving
the file exceeds 254 characters.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, make sure that the path to the file contains
fewer than 255 characters. To do this, do either of the following:

<UL><LI>Rename the folders that contain the file so that they have shorter
   names and the resulting path contains less than 255 characters.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Move the file to a folder with a shorter path name.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
