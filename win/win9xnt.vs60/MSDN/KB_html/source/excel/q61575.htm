<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel version 4.0 and later, use the following formula to
find the number of weekdays between two dates, where A1 equals the
first date first date and A2 equals the second date:
<P>
<PRE>   =NETWORKDAYS(A1,A2)

</PRE>NOTE: The dates in A1 and A2 must be weekdays, or the result may not
be correct.
<P>
In all versions of Microsoft Excel including version 4.0 the following
formula can be used to get the same result as the NETWORKDAYS function:
<P>
<PRE>   =A2-A1+1-INT((A2-A1+1)/7)*2-IF(INT((A2-A1+1)/7)=(A2-
   A1+1)/7,0,IF(WEEKDAY(A2)&lt;WEEKDAY(A1),2,0))-
   IF(OR(WEEKDAY(A1)=1,WEEKDAY(A2)=7),1,0)

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The first part of the formula determines the total number of days
between the two dates.
<P>
The next section determines the number or whole weeks between the two
dates. This section then multiplies that by two because there is a
Saturday and a Sunday in each whole week.
<P>
The last section determines if the range spanned a weekend even though
it was not a whole week. For example, if your start date was on a
Thursday, and your end date was on a Monday, there would be a weekend
in between. The WEEKDAY function would return a 2 for Monday and a 5
for Thursday, so an additional two days are subtracted.
<P>
If you are using Microsoft Excel version 4.0 and the NETWORKDAYS
function is not available, you must install the Analysis ToolPak
add-in macro. For more information on managing ad-ins, see "Managing
Add-in Commands and Functions" in Chapter 4 of the "Microsoft Excel
User's Guide 2."
