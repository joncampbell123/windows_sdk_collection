The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the multilanguage support feature in Microsoft Windows 95,
the following symptoms occur in Microsoft Excel:

<UL><LI>When you change the language in Windows using the Language indicator
   on the Windows taskbar, the characters that you enter in Microsoft Excel
   appear as extended ANSI characters instead of the characters for the
   selected language. The font in Microsoft Excel does not change to the
   expected font for the language setting.

<LI>When you format a cell on your worksheet for a different language
   font, such as Arial Greek, if you apply font formatting to the cell,
   such as Bold, the characters appear as the extended ANSI characters
   instead of the Greek characters, although the Font box continues to
   display the applied font, such as Arial Greek.

<LI>If you set the Standard font in Microsoft Excel to a different
   language font, such as Arial Greek, and you change the language in
   Windows to this same language (Greek), the characters that you type on
   your worksheet appear as extended ANSI characters instead of as the
   characters for the language setting.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs because multilingual support is not fully
implemented in Microsoft Excel.
<P>
When you install the Windows Multilanguage Support feature, you can create
documents in Bulgarian, Belarusian, Czech Republic, Hungarian, Greek,
Polish, Russian, and Sloverian. TrueType fonts are installed for these
languages: namely Arial CE, Arial Cyr, Arial Greek, Courier New CE, Courier
New Cyr, Courier New Greek, Times New Roman CE, Times New Roman Cyr, Times
New Roman Greek. To actually type these characters, you can also install
the keyboard language and layout for these languages.
<P>
When you install Multilanguage Support and install the keyboard language
and layout for a given language, some of the Windows applications, for
example Word for Windows, automatically change to the corresponding font
for that language. For example, if you are using the font Arial in Word for
Windows, and you switch to the Greek keyboard language and layout, the font
changes to Arial Greek, and the characters you type in your document
are displayed as Greek characters. However, in Microsoft Excel, when you
change the keyboard language and layout setting, the keyboard layout
changes (different characters appear when you type) but the font does not
change to the font for that language setting.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
To work around these issues and display the appropriate language characters
in Microsoft Excel, apply the appropriate language font, such as Arial
Greek, to the cells that are displaying the extended ANSI characters. Even
if the Font box already displays this font, you may need to apply the font
again to change the characters that are displayed.
<P>
Note that to work around the issue of the characters being changed when you
apply font formatting, such as Bold, you can also use the Font tab in the
Format Cells dialog box instead of the buttons on the Formatting toolbar to
format the characters.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
