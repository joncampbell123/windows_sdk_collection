                                 ========

</PRE>This article describes the four standard financial reports that are
generated by the Report Wizard in Microsoft Small Business Financial
Manager for Microsoft Excel (SBFM), and the related sub reports that are
available for each report. The four standard financial reports that are
generated by the Report Wizard are as follows: the Income Statement, the
Balance Sheet, the Trial Balance, and the Statement of Change in
Stockholders' Equity. These reports in turn have related sub reports.

Ledger, the debit or credit balance of each account, and the totals of the
debit and credit balances. It is not a formal accounting statement.
