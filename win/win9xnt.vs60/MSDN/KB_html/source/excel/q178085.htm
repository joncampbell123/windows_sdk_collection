The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0c, 4.0, 4.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the built-in Delete command on the File menu in the versions
of Microsoft Excel that are listed at the beginning of this article, the
files you delete are not sent to the Recycle Bin. However, the files are
permanently deleted.  Note that Microsoft Excel confirms whether you want
to delete the files but does not give you the option to send the files to
the Recycle Bin.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs when you use the built-in Delete command on the File
menu in Microsoft Excel under Microsoft Windows 95 or Microsoft Windows NT
4.0.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To workaround this behavior, delete the file by using one of the following
methods.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1: Using Microsoft Windows Explorer</h3>
 
<P>
To use Windows Explorer to work around this behavior, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Start Windows Explorer by clicking Start, pointing to Programs, and
   then clicking Windows Explorer.

<P><LI>In the left pane of Windows Explorer, open the folder that contains the
   files you want to delete.
<P>
   The files in that folder appear on the right.

<P><LI>In the right pane of Windows Explorer, select the file that you want to
   send to the Recycle Bin. On the File menu, click Delete.
<P>
   You are prompted whether to send the file to the Recycle Bin.

<P><LI>Click Yes.
<P>
</OL><h3>Method 2: Using My Computer</h3>
 
<P>
To use My Computer to work around this behavior, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Double-click My Computer on the desktop.

<P><LI>Double-click the drive you are working with, and then double-
   click the folder that contains the files you want to delete.

<P><LI>Select the file that you want to send to the Recycle Bin.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Delete.
<P>
   You are prompted whether to send the file to the Recycle Bin.

<P><LI>Click Yes.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>

This behavior is by design of Microsoft Excel.
