The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows, Service Release 1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows, Service Release 1 (SR-1), if you run a
Visual Basic for Applications macro that attempts to set the
ProtectGoalSeek property of a chart, you may receive the following error
message:
<P>
<PRE>   This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down.
   If the problem persists, contact the program vendor.

</PRE>If you click Details, you receive an error message similar to the
following:
<P>
<PRE>   EXCEL caused an invalid page fault in module EXCEL.EXE at
   0137:3002a5dd.

</PRE>NOTE: The same Visual Basic macro works correctly in the original version
of Excel 97.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when the chart is embedded in a worksheet, and the
macro attempts to set the ProtectGoalSeek property without first activating
the chart. For example, either of the following lines of code may cause the
problem to occur:
<P>
<PRE>   ActiveSheet.ChartObjects("Chart 1").Chart.ProtectGoalSeek = True

   -or-

   ActiveSheet.ChartObjects(1).Chart.ProtectGoalSeek = False

</PRE><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft provides examples of Visual Basic for Applications procedures for

for a particular purpose. The Visual Basic procedures in this article are
provided 'as is' and Microsoft does not guarantee that they can be used in
all situations. While Microsoft support engineers can help explain the
functionality of a particular macro, they will not modify these examples to
provide added functionality, nor will they help you construct macros to
meet your specific needs. If you have limited programming experience, you
may want to consult one of the Microsoft Solution Providers. Solution
Providers offer a wide range of fee-based services, including creating
custom macros. For more information about Microsoft Solution Providers,
call Microsoft Customer Information Service at (800) 426-9400.
<P>
To prevent this problem from occurring, activate the chart before
attempting to set its ProtectGoalSeek property. The following sample macro
demonstrates how to do this:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub SetProtectGoalSeekProperty()

       'Activate the chart object.
       ActiveSheet.ChartObjects(1).Activate

       'Set the ProtectGoalSeek property to True or False, as appropriate.
       ActiveChart.ProtectGoalSeek = True

   End Sub

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In Excel, the ProtectGoalSeek property of a chart determines whether or not
a user can change a value in a chart by dragging a chart data point up and
down. If the ProtectGoalSeek property of a chart is True, the user cannot
drag data points. If it is False, the user can drag data points.
