The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0c

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, you may receive the following error message when
you run a Visual Basic, Applications Edition, procedure that contains the
ChartWizard method:
<P>
<PRE>   Run-time error '1004':

   External reference is not valid

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs if the Source argument that you use with the
ChartWizard method contains a number of nonadjacent range references.
Note that the number of the range references that will cause this
error message depends on the length of the name of the worksheet that
the chart is created on.
<P>
For example, the following procedure correctly creates a chart on the
active sheet, Sheet1, (assuming that the range A1:B14 on Sheet1
contains data):
<P>
<PRE>   Sub CreateChart()
      ActiveSheet.ChartObjects.Add(100, 40, 300, 200).Select
      Application.CutCopyMode = False
      ActiveChart.ChartWizard Source:= Range( _
        "A1:B1,A2:B2,A3:B3,A4:B4,A5:B5,A6:B6,A7:B7," _
        &amp; "A8:B8,A9:B9,A10:B10,A11:B11,A12:B12,A13:B13")
   End Sub

</PRE>If you add another reference in the Range object for the Source argument,
you receive the error message described above when you run the procedure.
<P>
This problem occurs because Visual Basic converts the range string
("A1:C1,A2:C2,...") into a parsed reference. When you use the
ChartWizard method with this reference, the ChartWizard method
converts this reference to a string. When this occurs, the reference
is converted to R1C1 format, and the sheet name is added to each
individual reference. This causes the reference string to exceed the
allotted buffer, and to be cut off. Because the reference is cut off,
you receive the error message above when the ChartWizard method
attempts to create the chart.

<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To avoid receiving the error message above, use one of the following
methods.
<P>
Method 1: Use the MS Excel 4.0 Macro equivalent, CHART.WIZARD().
<P>
<PRE>          The CHART.WIZARD() function works correctly with nonadjacent cell
          references because the range remains a string and does not need
          to be converted. The original string that you use as the Ref
          argument in the CHART.WIZARD function is the string that is
          parsed.

</PRE>Method 2: Copy and paste the cells in the range from which you are creating
<PRE>          the chart so that they appear as one contiguous range. This range
          can then be referred to as one single range in the ChartWizard
          method.

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft Excel
versions listed above. We are researching this problem and will post
new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The ChartWizard method modifies the properties of the given chart and
allows a chart to be quickly formatted without setting all the
individual properties. This method is non-interactive and changes
only the specified properties.
<P>
One of the named arguments for the ChartWizard method is called Source. The
Source argument is used to specify the range that contains the source data
for the chart. It is required if you are creating a chart and is optional
if you are editing an existing chart.
<P>
If Source is omitted and the selection is not an embedded chart on the
active worksheet, or the active sheet is not an existing chart, the method
fails and an error occurs.
