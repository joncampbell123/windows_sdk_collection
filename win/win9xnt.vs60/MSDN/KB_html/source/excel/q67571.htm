The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, version 2.x, 3.x, 4.x, 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The following Visual Basic procedure (version 5.0 only) and Microsoft Excel
macro will batch print all the documents that are currently open in
Microsoft Excel:
<P>
<P><h3>Visual Basic Procedure</h3>
 
<P>
The following procedure prints all of the sheets in each open workbook in
Microsoft Excel version 5.0.
<P>
Microsoft provides examples of Visual Basic procedures for illustration
only, without warranty either expressed or implied, including but not
limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and/or fitness for a
particular purpose. This Visual Basic procedure is provided 'as is' and
Microsoft does not guarantee that it can be used in all situations.
Microsoft does not support modifications of this procedure to suit customer
requirements for a particular purpose. Note that a line that is preceded by
an apostrophe introduces a comment in the code--comments are provided to
explain what the code is doing at a particular point in the procedure. Note
also that an underscore character (_) indicates that code continues from
one line to the next. You can type lines that contain this character as one
logical line or you can divide the lines of code and include the line
continuation character. For more information about Visual Basic for
Applications programming style, see the "Programming Style in This Manual"
section in the "Document Conventions" section of the "Visual Basic User's
Guide."
<P>
<PRE>   Sub Print_All()
      Dim n As Integer
      Dim c As Integer
      ' Find number of open workbooks
      n = Application.Workbooks.Count
      'Loop through and print each open workbook
      For c = 1 To n
         Application.Workbooks(c).PrintOut
      Next c
   End Sub

</PRE><h3>Microsoft Excel Macro</h3>
 
(Note that if you run this macro in Microsoft Excel version 5.0, only the
active sheet in each open workbook will print)

<OL><P><LI>The macro sheet name enclosed in quotation marks in cell A5 must be
   the name of the macro sheet on which you put this macro. This is so
   the macro will not print itself.

<P><LI>The Windows version 3.0 print spooler imposes a 20-file limitation. This
   macro does not check for circumstances exceeding this maximum. Normally,
   this should not be a problem because it is close to the maximum
   number of documents Microsoft Excel can have open (Read/Write under
   Windows 3.0). Chances are that the spooler will have completed
   printing some of the files by the time Microsoft Excel sends all
   the documents to the spooler. The limit in Windows version 3.1 is 100
   print jobs.

<P><LI>If the 20-file limitation does pose a problem in practice, the WAIT
   function may be used to allow the spooler some additional time to
   send a file to the printer before Microsoft Excel sends another
   document to the spooler. The following line may be inserted between
   cells A5 and A6:
<P>
<P><PRE>      =WAIT(NOW()+TIMEVALUE("00:02:00"))
</PRE><P>
   This line will cause the macro to pause for 2 minutes before
   sending the next document.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: Microsoft provides macro examples for illustration only, without
warranty either expressed or implied, including but not limited to the
implied warranties of merchantability and/or fitness for a particular
purpose. This macro is provided 'as is' and Microsoft does not
guarantee that the following code can be used in all situations.
Microsoft does not support modifications of the code to suit customer
requirements.
<P>
The following is the macro:
<P>
A1: Print_Docs
A2: =COLUMNS(DOCUMENTS())
A3: =FOR("Count",1,A2,1)
A4: =ACTIVATE(INDEX(DOCUMENTS(),1,Count))
A5: =IF(GET.DOCUMENT(1)&lt;&gt;"macro1.xlm",PRINT())
A6: =NEXT()
A7: =RETURN()
