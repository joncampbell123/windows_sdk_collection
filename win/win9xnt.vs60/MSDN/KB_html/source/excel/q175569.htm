The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 97, if you print a nonrectangular object, such as a
drawing object or an AutoShape, that is filled with either a picture or a
texture, the picture or texture may "leak out" of the object and fill a
larger rectangular area in the printed output.
<P>
Note that the object appears correctly in print preview.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may occur if you are printing to any of the following
printers:
<P>
<PRE>   Canon BJC-210
   Canon BJC-610
   Canon BJC-4200

</PRE><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
You may be able to work around this problem by adding a "ForceOpaque" line
to the section in your Win.ini file that stores settings for the printer
driver that you are using. To do this, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Start menu, click Run. In the Open box, type "Win.ini" (without
   quotation marks). Click OK.

<P><LI>On the Search menu, click Find. In the Find What box, type "Canon"
   (without quotation marks). Click Find Next. Continue to click
   Find Next until a line similar to either of the following is selected:
<P>
<P><PRE>      [Canon BJC-210,\\printerserver\printer]
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      [Canon BJC-210,LPT1]
</PRE><P>
   Then, click Cancel.

<P><LI>Insert a new line below the "[Canon BJC-210,\\printerserver\printer]"
   line. Type the following text:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ForceOpaque=1
</PRE>
<P><LI>On the File menu, click Save. Then, click Exit on the File menu.

<P><LI>Quit and restart Microsoft Excel 97.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: After you make this change to your Win.ini file, objects that use
semitransparent fills are still printed correctly in Microsoft Excel 97
even though the setting you changed is the ForceOpaque setting.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may occur when you print a worksheet that contains a
rectangular object that is filled with a picture and is rotated. Because
the object is rotated, it is no longer considered rectangular.
<P>
When the worksheet is printed, the fill extends past the boundaries of the
rectangle and fills the rectangular area that surrounds the rotated object.
<P>
It is not necessary to restart Microsoft Windows after you change the
Win.ini file; however, it is necessary to quit and restart Microsoft Excel
97.
<P>
NOTE: If the workaround in this article does not correct the problem,
contact Canon or your printer manufacturer to see if an updated driver that
corrects this problem is available. You can access the Canon Web site at
the following address:
