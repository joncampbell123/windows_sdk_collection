The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you view a document in print preview or if you print the document, cells
may appear or be printed with borders.
<P>
NOTE: This behavior occurs even if no border formatting is applied to the
cell.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may occur when all of the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>You are sharing the workbook.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -and-
</PRE>
<LI>The Highlight Changes On Screen check box is selected in the
   Highlight Changes dialog box.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -and-
</PRE>
<LI>You modify the workbook without first saving it.
<P>
</UL><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this behavior, use one of the following workarounds.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1: Clear the Highlight Changes on Screen Check Box</h3>
 
<P>
To prevent borders from appearing around cells when you share the workbook
with unsaved changes, clear the Highlight Changes On Screen check box. To
do this, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, point to Track Changes, and then click Highlight
   Changes.

<P><LI>In the Highlight Changes dialog box, clear the Highlight Changes On
   Screen check box.

<P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
</OL>By clearing the Highlight Changes On Screen check box, the changed cells
are not highlighted (marked) on the worksheet, and the changed cells do not
appear with borders in print preview or in the printed document. When
changed cells are marked on the worksheet, borders appear in print preview
or in the printed document; you cannot set these two options independently.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 2: Click "Since I Last Saved"</h3>
 
<P>
If you click Since I Last Saved in the When list (in the Highlight
Changes dialog box), and then save the workbook, all modifications are
saved. After you save the file, the cells that were marked as changed cells
do not appear with a border. To use this method, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, point to Track Changes, and then click Highlight
   Changes.

<P><LI>In the When list, click Since I Last Saved.

<P><LI>Click OK.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Save.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: If you point to Track Changes on the Tools menu, and then click
Accept Or Reject Changes, you are prompted to save the workbook before
you can accept or reject the changes. After you save the workbook, the
changed cells do not appear with a border.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design of Microsoft Excel.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you select the Highlight Changes On Screen check box, any cells that
you change are marked on the worksheet with a colored border, and a small
triangle appears in the upper-left corner of the cell. If you move the
pointer over this triangle, a comment box appears with information about
the latest modification to the cell. Also, if you manually add a comment to
the cell, the text of the comment and the text of the changes message are
combined to appear when you move the pointer over the triangle in either
the upper-left or upper-right corner of the cell.
<P>
<P><h2>REFERENCES</h2>
 
<P>

Microsoft Excel Help, type the following text
<P>
<PRE>   tracking changes, overview

in Microsoft Excel" topic, and click Go To. If you are unable to find the
information you need, ask the Office Assistant.
