</PRE>The following information applies to Microsoft Excel for Windows(R),
versions 5.x, 7.0,7.0a and 97.
<P>
<P><h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
 
<P>
This Application Note contains versions 1.2 and 2.0 of the Virus Search add-
in. You can use this add-in to remove the Laroux virus from your computer.
If you are using Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows, you need to use version
2.0 of the Virus Search add-in. If you are using Microsoft Excel versions
5.0 or 7.0 for Windows, you need to use version 1.2 of the Virus Search add-
in.
<P>
<P><h2>WHAT IS THE LAROUX VIRUS?</h2>
 
<P>
The Laroux macro is a nonharmful, nondestructive "concept" virus that
appends a module named "Laroux" to a workbook. It does not affect data or
anything else in the workbook. This is the first replicating macro virus
ever discovered in Microsoft Excel. The virus affects workbooks created in
the following versions of Microsoft Excel:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel version 5.x for Windows 3.x
<LI>Microsoft Excel version 5.x for Windows NT®
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0 (for Windows 95 and
   Windows NT)
<LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
<LI>Certain localized versions of Microsoft Excel (for example, versions of
   Microsoft Excel translated to German)
<P>
</UL>This virus does not affect any version of Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh
or Microsoft Excel versions 2.x, 3.x, or 4.x for Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>DETECTING THE LAROUX VIRUS</h2>
 
<P>
To determine if you have the virus:

<OL><P><LI>Start Microsoft Excel.

<P><LI>Open a workbook that you suspect contains the virus.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, point to Macro, and then click Macros.

<P><LI>If you see the following macro names in the list, the Laroux
   virus may be present:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Auto_Open
      Check_Files
      PERSONAL.XLS!auto_open
      PERSONAL.XLS!check_files
</PRE><P>
   Note: If you see only the Auto_Open macro, without the Check_Files
   macro, it's possible that the workbook does not contain the virus.

<P><LI>If any workbooks that you have open in the background also
   contain the virus, you may also see the following names listed
<P>
<P><PRE>      'bookname'!auto_open
      'bookname'!check_files
</PRE><P>
   where 'bookname'! is the name of the open workbook.

<P><LI>You can confirm the existence of the virus macro by clicking
   the Unhide command on the Window menu and then clicking the Personal.xls
   file name.
<P>
</OL>In the Personal.xls workbook, a sheet tab with the word "Laroux" indicates
that the virus is present.
<P>
<P><h2>MICROSOFT EXCEL 97: USING THE VIRUS SEARCH ADD-IN VERSION 2.0</h2>
 
<P>
NOTE: The English language version of the Microsoft Excel Virus Search add-
In is not supported for use with the international versions of Microsoft
Excel.
<P>
The add-in program includes four files and a readme file. To install the
Virus Search version 2.0 add-in, use the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Quit Microsoft Excel.

<P><LI>If you received a disk with this Application Note, insert the
   disk in the appropriate floppy drive.
<P>
   If you downloaded this Application Note, skip to step 3. This procedure
   assumes that you have already downloaded and extracted the compressed
   file.

<P><LI>On the Windows Start menu, click Run, and then type
   drive:location\Xlscan97.exe
<P>
   where drive and location point to the location of the file. For example,
   if the file is located in the C:\Downloads folder, type:
<P>
<P><PRE>      c:\Downloads\Xlscan97.exe
</PRE><P>
   A dialog box will display the following message:
<P>
<P><PRE>      This program will install the Microsoft Excel 97 Laroux Virus
      Scanner. Do you want to continue?
</PRE>
<P><LI>Click Yes to install the add-in.
<P>
</OL><h3>To Load the Add-in in Microsoft Excel</h3>
 
<P>
To load the add-in, use the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Start Microsoft Excel.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Add-Ins.

<P><LI>Click to select the Microsoft Excel Virus Search check box.
<P>
   If you don't see this add-in listed, click Browse, and use the  Browse
   dialog box to locate and select the Xlscan97.xla file. In the Add-Ins
   dialog box, click OK.
<P>
   The Virus Search add-in program will be started.

<P><LI>When prompted to search for the Laroux virus, click Yes.
<P>
</OL>The first time you load the Virus Search add-in, workbooks you currently
have open are automatically scanned, and you have the option to scan saved
files. The add-in opens each file, and if the Laroux virus is found, the
add-in removes it and saves the clean file. For more information about
using the Virus Scan add-in, see the "To clean the files on your disk or
shared network directories" on page 4 of this Application Note.
<P>
Once you have installed the add-in, you can remove the virus from workbook
files on your hard disk and shared network folders. After doing this, you
can continue to use the Virus Search add-in to periodically search for
viruses.
<P>
<P><h3>Troubleshooting Installation Problems</h3>
 
<P>
If you have problems with the installation, check the files listed in the
following table to be sure they were installed to the appropriate

</PRE></OL><h3>Using the Add-in to Remove the Laroux Virus</h3>
 
<P>
NOTE: Before cleaning files on your disk or on shared network folders,
close any other programs that are running. While the Virus Search add-in is
running, do not start other programs.
<P>
<P><h3>To clean the files on your disk or shared network directories</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Close any open workbooks.

<P><LI>If the Virus Search add-in is not currently running, click
   Virus Search on the Tools menu.
<P>
   If the Virus Search add-in is already running, respond to the prompt
   asking if you want to scan your files for the virus by clicking the Yes
   button.

<P><LI>Click the Currently Open Workbooks And Disk Files option, and
   then click OK.

<P><LI>When prompted that open workbooks will be saved, click OK.

<P><LI>When prompted about scanning workbooks older than the date when
   the Laroux virus was first detected, do either of the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - If you want to check all workbooks regardless of their age, click
      Yes.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - If you want to check only workbooks that have been saved since
      the Laroux virus appeared, click No.
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: Clicking No may speed up the process by scanning fewer workbooks.

<P><LI>In the dialog box that prompts you to type the path of the folder to
   search, do the following:
<P>
   a. In the Directory box, type the path to the folder on your
<P><PRE>      hard disk or on a shared network folder in which you want to start
      scanning for the virus.
</PRE><P>
   b. In the File Types box, type all file extensions used on your
<P><PRE>      system for Microsoft Excel workbooks or workbook templates.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      For example, .xls and .xlt are the default extensions. Type the
      extensions in the format shown, and separate each entry with a
      semicolon, as in the following example:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>         *.xls; *.xlt

</PRE><P><LI>To search all folders within the top-level folder you  specified, make
   sure the Include Subfolders check box is checked, and
   click OK.
<P>
</OL>The add-in will prepare Microsoft Excel and start the scanning
utility.

<OL><P><LI>Click Start to begin the scan. The add-in removes the Laroux virus from
   any files in which it is detected and saves the cleaned files
   automatically.

<P><LI>When the scan is complete, click Yes to repeat the search starting from
   a different top-level folder, or click No to exit.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: If an alert message appears while scanning, click OK to continue the
search. If Microsoft Excel or the Virus Search add-in stops responding
because it encounters a corrupted workbook file, manually delete the file
from your hard disk or from the shared network drive and run the add-in
again.
<P>
<P><h3>To remove the virus from a protected, read-only, or shared workbook</h3>
 
<P>
If a workbook is protected for structure, is read-only, or is a shared
workbook, the virus cannot be removed. If you have a workbook of any of
these types, you can scan it to determine whether it has the virus. If the
virus is found, unprotect the workbook, make it read/write, or remove it
from shared use, and then repeat the virus scan.
<P>
<P><h3>Opening New Workbooks Safely in Microsoft Excel 97</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft Excel 97 includes a Macro Virus Protection feature. This feature
automatically checks all workbooks and workbook templates that you open by
using Open on the File menu or the Open button on the Standard toolbar. If
a workbook contains macros, the scanner displays a warning message that
lets you decide how to open the workbook.
<P>
Macro Virus Protection does not recognize any particular virus, it just
detects macros stored within a workbook. Therefore, you will see this
warning even when the macros are "safe." If you are unsure whether a
particular workbook with macros is safe, click the Disable Macros button.
Then if you have installed the Virus Search add-in, use Virus Search on the
Tools menu to search the workbook for the Laroux Virus.
<P>
By default, the Macro Virus Protection feature is turned on in Microsoft
Excel 97. To confirm that the feature is turned on, click Options on the
Tools menu, and then click the General tab. If the Macro Virus Protection
check box is cleared, click the Macro Virus Protection box to select it,
and then click OK.
<P>
<P><h2>MANUALLY CHECKING A FILE FOR THE LAROUX VIRUS</h2>

<P><h3>To examine macros manually for the Laroux virus</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>If you do not have the Virus Search add-in installed, click
   Disable Macros when you open the workbook.
<P>
   The workbook will be opened without running any macros.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, point to Macro, and then click Macros.

<P><LI>In the list of macros, delete any of the following macro names
   that appear:
<P>

   click to select the Scan Subdirectories check box.
<P>
   To display a worksheet that lists the results when the scan is
   complete, click to select the Log Searched Files check box.

<P><LI>Click OK to begin scanning the files.
<P>
</OL>During the scan, the Laroux virus is removed from any files in which it is
detected, and the cleaned files are then saved automatically.
When the scan is complete, click Yes to repeat the search starting
from a different top-level folder, or click No to close the dialog box and
return to Microsoft Excel.
<P>
<P><h3>To remove the virus from a protected, read-only, or shared workbook</h3>
 
<P>
If a workbook is protected for structure, is read-only, or is a shared
workbook, the virus cannot be removed. If you have a workbook of any of
these types, you can scan it to determine whether it has the virus. If the
virus is found, unprotect the workbook, make it read/write, or remove it
from shared use, and then repeat the virus scan.
<P>
To remove the virus from a workbook opened from a source other than
Microsoft Excel
 
<P>
If you open a workbook from File Manager or Windows Explorer, from an
electronic mail message, or from a Web browser such as Microsoft Internet
Explorer, the workbook is not scanned automatically for macros that may
contain viruses. If you open workbooks in any of these ways, or if you
decide to open a workbook with macros, use the following steps to check the
workbook and remove the Laroux virus before you save the workbooks (if you
don't do use these steps before you save the workbook, you may
inadvertently infect another workbook with the virus):

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Virus Search.

<P><LI>Click the Currently Open Workbooks option, and then click OK.

<P><LI>If the Virus Search add-in reports that the Laroux virus was
   found and removed from a workbook, it prompts you to save the workbook.
   Click Yes, so that the clean version of the workbook is saved on your
   Disk over the version that has the virus.
<P>
</OL><h2>MANUALLY CHECKING A FILE FOR THE LAROUX VIRUS</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>To examine macros manually for the Laroux virus</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>If you do not have the Virus Search add-in installed, hold down
   the shift key while you open the workbook.
<P>
   The workbook is opened without running any macros (if you don't hold
   down the shift key, some macros run automatically when you open a
   workbook).
<P>
   Note: If you have the Virus Search add-in installed, the SHIFT+Open
   capability is disabled. Click Open on the File menu, double-click the
   workbook you want to open, select the Do Not Run Auto_Open Macro check
   box, and then click Open With Macros.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Macro.

<P><LI>In the list of macros, delete any of the following macro names
   that appear:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Auto_Open
      Check_Files
      PERSONAL.XLS!auto_open
      PERSONAL.XLS!check_files
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: If the list contains the Auto_Open macro, but the Check_Files
   macro is not present, the file may not contain the Laroux virus.

<P><LI>Click OK.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Exit, and then click Yes to save all
   changes.
<P>
</OL>The file no longer contains the Laroux virus.
<P>
<P><h2>PREVENTING THE LAROUX AND OTHER VIRUSES FROM INFECTING YOUR COMPUTER</h2>
 
<P>
After you have scanned your workbooks and removed the Laroux virus, you can
prevent the virus from returning by taking the following precautions:

<UL><LI>Open workbooks by clicking Open on the File menu or by clicking
   the Open button (on the Standard toolbar). When you open workbooks in
   this way, they are automatically scanned for macros when you have the
   add-in loaded.

<LI>If you open a workbook from File Manager or Windows Explorer, from an
   electronic mail message, or from a Web browser, such as Microsoft
   Internet Explorer, immediately check the workbook for the Laroux virus
   By using the Virus Search command on the Tools menu, as explained in the
   "To remove the virus from a workbook opened from a source other than
   Microsoft Excel" section on page 8 of this document. Workbooks opened in
   any of these ways are not automatically scanned for macros, so it's
   important for you to check them for the virus.

<LI>The Microsoft Excel Virus Search add-in can detect and remove the
   Laroux virus only. If new viruses are discovered in the future,
   Microsoft will provide information about what you need to do to remove
   them from your files and prevent them from recurring. To minimize the
   possibility of acquiring any new viruses that may appear, do the
   following:
<P>
   1. Always open workbooks by clicking Open on the File menu or by
<P><PRE>      clicking the Open button (on the Standard toolbar).
</PRE><P>
   2. Open workbooks with their macros only if you are certain of the
<P><PRE>      reliability of the source from which you obtained the workbook.
</PRE><P>
   3. If you aren't sure about the source of a workbook, open it
<P><PRE>      without macros.
</PRE><P>
</UL><h2>HOW THE VIRUS SEARCH ADD-IN VERSION 1.2 CHANGES MICROSOFT EXCEL</h2>
 
<P>
The Virus Search add-in makes several changes to Microsoft Excel that
affect how you open files.
<P>
<P><h3>The Recently Used Files List Is Removed</h3>
 
<P>
With the Virus Search add-in installed, you do not see a list of recently
opened files when you click the File menu. To open a recently used file,
click Open on the File menu or click the Open button (on the Standard
toolbar).
<P>
Not All File Types Are Listed in the Files of Type Box in the Open Dialog
Box
 
<P>
When you install the Virus Search add-in, the Files Of Type list in the
Open dialog box no longer lists certain rarely used file types. However,
you can still open files of these types. If you don't see the file type
you're looking for in the Files Of Type list, click All Files (*.*) (the
first selection in the list), click the name of the file you want, and
click the Open button.
<P>
<P><h3>Can't Open Workbooks as Read-Only from the Open Dialog Box</h3>
 
<P>
When you install the Virus Search add-in, the Open dialog box (the dialog
box that is displayed when you click Open on the File menu) no longer lets
you open a workbook as read-only.
<P>
To open a workbook as read-only, uninstall the Virus Search add-in, or use
the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the File menu, click Open, and then open the workbook.

<P><LI>On the View menu, click Toolbars. In the Toolbars box, select
   the Workgroup check box, and then click OK.

<P><LI>To make the workbook read-only, click the Toggle Read Only button on the
   Workgroup toolbar.
<P>
</OL><h3>Can't Use SHIFT+Open to Prevent Auto_Open from Running</h3>
 
<P>
With the Virus Search add-in installed, holding down the shift key while
opening files will no longer prevent the Auto_Open macro from running.
Instead, use Open on the File menu to open a workbook. If you do not want
the Auto_Open macro to run, select the Do Not Run Auto_Open Macro check
box, and then click Open With Macros.
<P>
<P><h3>Text Import Wizard Does Not Start Automatically</h3>
 
<P>
When you open a text file, Microsoft Excel typically starts the Text Import
Wizard. With the Virus Search add-in installed, Microsoft Excel cannot
start the Text Import Wizard as it usually does. Instead, Microsoft Excel
asks whether you want to use the Text Import Wizard. If you click OK, the
Virus Search add-in turns off its detection capabilities, and displays the
Open dialog box with the text file selected by default. Click OK to open
the text file and run the Text Import Wizard.
<P>
<P><h2>UNINSTALLING THE MICROSOFT EXCEL VIRUS SEARCH 1.2 ADD-IN</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>To uninstall the Virus Search add-in</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Add-ins.

<P><LI>Clear the Microsoft Excel Virus Search check box, and then
   click OK.
<P>
</OL>When you uninstall the add-in, the Open dialog box works as it did before
you installed the add-in. The Xlscan.xla file remains in your Library
folder so that you can easily reinstall it later.

questions and answers are current as of February 17, 1996.

<PRE>1. Q. What are macro viruses?

   A. Macro viruses are a type of virus that use an application's own macro
      programming language to distribute themselves. Unlike previous
      viruses, macro viruses do not infect programs; they infect documents.

2. Q. What is Sofa?

   A. This is a non-harmful, non-destructive macro virus that does not
      Affect data in any way. Infected files display the application header
      "Microsofa Excel" instead of "Microsoft Excel."

3. Q. What is ExcelMacro/Laroux?

   A. This is a non-harmful, non-destructive concept virus. It simply
      Appends a macro sheet called "laroux" to workbooks. It does not
      affect data or anything else in the workbook. This is the first
      replicating macro virus ever discovered in Microsoft Excel.

4. Q. What is Laroux B?

   A. Laroux B is a variation of the original virus that is the same
      in all respects, but can overwrite existing macros on the user's
      Personal.xls macro sheet.
