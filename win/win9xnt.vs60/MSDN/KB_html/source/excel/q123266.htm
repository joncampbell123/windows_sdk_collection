<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, when you open a Lotus 1-2-3 WK4 file, any drawing
objects, such as macro buttons, text boxes, and lines are not
converted. Additionally, worksheet names are displayed as the Lotus
1-2-3 default A, B, C, and so on.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design. The Lotus 1-2-3 WK4 File Converter does
not convert drawing objects contained on a worksheet. This includes
any of the following items: embedded object, line, polyline, arrow,
rectangle, rounded rectangle, arc, ellipse, polygon, freehand, text,
button.
<P>
Note, however, that embedded chart objects and chart sheets are converted
correctly.
<P>
Note that in Lotus 1-2-3 Release 4, when you save a file that
contains a drawing object to the WK3 file format, you receive the
following error message
<P>
<PRE>   Incompatible worksheet information lost during saving

</PRE>and the drawing object is not saved.
<P>
Additionally, if you rename a worksheet in your Lotus 1-2-3 WK4 file,
the worksheet is displayed with the original default name (A, B, C,
and so on) when you open the file in Microsoft Excel.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this behavior when you open a Lotus 1-2-3 WK4 file in
Microsoft Excel, add any drawing objects after you open the file in
Microsoft Excel. You can also change any worksheet names after you
open the file in Microsoft Excel.
<P>
Note that you cannot save the file to the Lotus 1-2-3 WK4 file format
in Microsoft Excel.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
