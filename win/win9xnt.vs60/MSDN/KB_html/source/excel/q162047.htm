The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 97, when you cut and paste one or more worksheet cells,
you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down.
   If the problem persists, contact the program vendor.

</PRE>If you click Details, a message similar to the following appears:
<P>
<PRE>   EXCEL caused an invalid page fault in module EXCEL.EXE at
   0137:3023b8ca.

</PRE>When you click Close, Microsoft Excel 97 quits.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may occur when you cut and paste one or more cells that
contain data that is used by a PivotTable.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To prevent this problem from occurring, do not cut and paste cells that
contain data that is used by a PivotTable. Instead, copy and paste the
cells.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Excel 97 for
Windows. This problem was corrected in Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows,
Service Release 1. Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows Service Release 1 does
not allow the cutting of cells in a pivot table.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, you can transfer information from one cell to another,
or from one range of cells to another, by cutting and pasting the
information, or by copying and pasting the information. The following table
lists the results that occur when you use these methods.
<P>
<PRE>   Method           Result
   ------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Cut and Paste    When you click Cut, the contents of the selected
                    cells are copied to the Clipboard, and the cells are
                    erased. When you click Paste, the contents of the
                    Clipboard are pasted into the worksheet.

   Copy and Paste   When you click Copy, the contents of the selected
                    cells are copied to the Clipboard. The cells are NOT
                    erased. When you click Paste, the contents of the
                    Clipboard are pasted into the worksheet.

</PRE>If you cut and paste one or more cells from a range of cells that contain
data that is used by a PivotTable, the PivotTable may not be able to
function correctly because the data is no longer available in the original
cells. If this occurs, you may receive the error messages listed in this
article.
<P>
Copying and pasting data from cells that contain data that is used by a
PivotTable does not cause a problem because the data is still available in
the original cells used by the PivotTable.
