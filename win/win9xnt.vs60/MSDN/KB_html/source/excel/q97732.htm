<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you extract data from an external database that is not a
Microsoft Excel database (for example, a dBASE [.DBF] file or a Q+E
query [.QEF] file), the cells under the extract range will not
automatically be cleared.
<P>
Note: To access an external database that is not a Microsoft Excel
database, you must load the QE.XLA add-in macro.
<P>
<P><h3>Workaround</h3>
 
<P>
If are not using a macro to extract data, select the records that
are displayed beneath the extract range, and choose Clear from the Edit
menu before each extraction. This procedure will clear the contents of
the cells in your extract range.
<P>
If you are using a macro to extract the data, you can use the OFFSET()
function along with the DCOUNTA() and COLUMNS() functions to select
and clear the previously extracted data, as in the following sample
macro:
<P>
<PRE>   A1: Clear_Extract
   A2: =SELECT(OFFSET(!Extract,1,0,DCOUNTA(!Database,,!Criteria),
       COLUMNS(!Extract)))
   A3: =CLEAR(1)

</PRE>In the sample macro above, cell A1 contains the name of the macro. The
formula in cell A2 selects the extracted records in the extract range;
in this formula, the DCOUNTA() function finds the number of rows to
select and the COLUMNS() function determines the number of columns to
select. The formula in cell A3 clears the contents of the selected
cells.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you extract data from a Microsoft Excel database, the cells in
the extract range are cleared to the bottom of the spreadsheet (even
if no information is extracted into them). These cells are
automatically cleared if the database is located on same spreadsheet
as the extract range or if it is an external Microsoft Excel database.
<P>
However, if you are using a non-Microsoft Excel database, such as a
dBASE or Q+E database, the cells in the extract range are not cleared.
When you use these databases, the extracted records will overwrite
whatever is presently showing in the extract range, but the other
cells in the extract range will not be cleared. For example, if you
have previously extracted 20 records, and then perform another extract
that only contains 5 records, the first 5 records will be replaced
with the results from the second extract, but the previous 15 records
will remain in the extract range.
