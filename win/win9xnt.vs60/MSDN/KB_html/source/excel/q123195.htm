The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, version 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, when you open a Lotus 1-2-3 WK1 file that contains a
split, you are not able to view data or select cells on the worksheet in
the inactive window.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs if you save the WK1 file in Lotus 1-2-3 while the
first pane (the pane located on the left side of the window with a vertical
split, or the top of the window with a horizontal split) is inactive. For
example, when you insert a vertical split in a worksheet in Lotus 1-2-3,
the worksheet is divided into two panes in the same window. If you select a
cell in the right pane, and then save the file, the above symptoms occur
when you open the file in Microsoft Excel.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To select the data on a worksheet in the inactive window when you open a
WK1 file that contains a split, select the inactive window, and then select
the worksheet tab to activate the worksheet in the inactive window. The
worksheet in the inactive window is not activated until you select the
worksheet tab.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in
Microsoft Excel version 5.0c.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In Lotus 1-2-3, you can use the Split command to divide a window into
panes so that you can have two different views of your worksheet.
When you open a WK1 file that contains a split in Microsoft Excel,
the worksheet is displayed in two different windows.
