<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition, you can control how charts,
drawing objects, AutoShapes, and other objects in a worksheet are placed
(attached to the cells below them). This article explains how to set the
Placement property for objects in worksheets.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Objects in worksheets can be attached to the cells below them by using one
of the three placement styles that are listed in the following table.
<P>
<PRE>   Placement
   Style                            xlConstant
   -----------------------------------------------

   Move and size with cells         xlMoveAndSize
   Move but don't size with cells   xlMove
   Don't move or size with cells    xlFreeFloating

</PRE>You can control how objects are attached to cells by using the Format
dialog box or by using Visual Basic for Application code.
<P>
<P><h3>Using the Format Dialog Box to Control Placement</h3>
 
<P>
To format the placement style for an object, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click to select the object.
