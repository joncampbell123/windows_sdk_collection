The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition, when you click or edit a cell that
contains a formula that links to a cell in another workbook, the program
may unexpectedly stop responding (hang) or quit without displaying any
error messages. Also, the cell may contain a #REF! error value.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may occur if the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>An open workbook (for example, Book1) contains a formula that refers
   to a cell in a worksheet with a name that is the same as the workbook
   name that contains the worksheet, for example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      =[Book3]Book3!A1
</PRE><P>
   -and-

<LI>The workbook referenced in the formula is closed.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>You save another workbook (for example, Book2) in the Microsoft Excel
   4.0 Worksheet format. When you save the worksheet, you use the same
   name as the name used in the formula (Book3), but you save the
   worksheet in a different folder.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>You then close Book3, switch to Book1, and then click or edit the cell
   that contains the formula that refers to the closed workbook.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this problem, do not give the worksheet the same name as another
workbook that is referenced by a formula in an open workbook when you save
a worksheet in the Microsoft Excel 4.0 Worksheet format.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Because the problem described in this article occurs only when you save a
worksheet in the Microsoft Excel 4.0 Worksheet format, you are not likely
to encounter this problem. If you must save worksheets in the Microsoft
Excel 4.0 Worksheet format, use the resolution in this article to prevent
the problem from occurring.
