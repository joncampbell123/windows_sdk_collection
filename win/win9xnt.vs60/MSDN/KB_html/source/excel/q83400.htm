<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Individual Analysis Tools files (for example, ANOVA.XLA) can be added
to the Add-In Manager in Microsoft Excel. However, when you
subsequently launching Microsoft Excel, the following alert will be
displayed:
<P>
<PRE>   This is a support file for the Analysis Toolpak. Use &lt;FILENAME&gt;
   by choosing Options Analysis Tools. If this menu is not available,
   you must install the Analysis Toolpak.

</PRE>If you have more than one support file added to the Add-In Manager,
you will receive an alert for each file.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Add-In Manager in Microsoft Excel allows you to choose which
Add-In functions you want to add to the startup list. To use the
functions  contained in the Analysis Toolpak, it is only necessary to
add two  files to the Add-In Manager: ANALYSISF.XLA (Analysis
Functions) and  ANALYSIS.XLA (Analysis Tools).
<P>
ANALYSISF.XLA adds financial, engineering and statistical functions;
ANALYSIS.XLA adds the engineering and statistical analysis procedures
accessible through Options Analysis Tools. These two files are located
in the \\Excel\Library\Analysis directory. Also located in this
directory are procedure files that support the Functions and Tools
Add-Ins. It is not necessary to add the individual files (for example,
ANOVA.XLA or FOURIER.XLA) to the Add-In Manager.
<P>
If you have added any of these other files and are receiving the alert
every time you start Excel, you can remove the support files by
choosing Add-Ins from the Options menu, selecting the file name from
the list of installed Add-Ins and choosing the Remove button.
Microsoft Excel  will display an alert asking you to confirm your
choice. Select OK and  the file will be removed from the list.
<P>
For more information on the Microsoft Excel Add-In functions, choose
Contents from the Help menu and select Macro Library from the list in
the Reference section.
