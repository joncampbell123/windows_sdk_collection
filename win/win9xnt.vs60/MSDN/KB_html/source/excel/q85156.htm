<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Excel does not print cell notes for cells that are in the
Print Title if there is a Print Area defined. If a Print Title is
defined but a Print Area is not defined, then Microsoft Excel prints
the cell notes for cells that are in the Print Title.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Excel version 2.x prints cell notes for cells that are in
the Print Title if a Print Area is defined and includes the cells in
the Print Title that contain the notes. Microsoft Excel versions 3.0
and later do not print the cell notes in this situation.
<P>
If a Print Area has also been defined on the same sheet, and the Print
Area does not include the cell in which the note has been entered, the
note will never print. This is because Print Titles are always printed
first, followed by the defined Print Area. Print Titles only include
what is visible on the screen, and therefore do not include notes.
Because the Print Area range does not include the cell with the note
attached, the note cannot be printed. The best workaround is to print
the sheets first, redefine the Print Area to include all cells with
notes and then print Notes only.
