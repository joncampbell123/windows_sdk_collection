The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, versions 2.2, 3.0, 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
Summary:
<P>
Microsoft Excel may not accept a password with special characters if
the file containing the password is opened under a different Macintosh
operating system. Codes for some characters created with the OPTION
key differ between System 6.0x and System 7.0x. Therefore, passwords
containing special OPTION characters created under System 6.0x may not
be recognized under System 7.0x, and vice versa. The only workaround
is to change or remove the password while operating the Macintosh with
the system that was in use when the file was created.
<P>
More Information:
<P>
Microsoft Excel versions 3.0 and 4.0 allow for three different
passwords in a worksheet: Protection Password and Write Reservation
Password when you choose Save As from the File menu, and Protect
Document on the Options menu. Excel version 2.2 allows two passwords:
Password when you choose Save As from the File menu and Protect
Document on the Options menu. If any of these passwords are assigned
with an OPTION key character, Excel may not accept the password when
the file is opened under a different system.
<P>
<P><h3>Workaround</h3>
 
<P>
To change the password:

<OL><P><LI>Restart the Macintosh using the system the file was created under.

<P><LI>Launch Microsoft Excel, and open the file.

<P><LI>Change (or delete) the password containing the special characters.

<P><LI>Save the file, replacing the existing file.
