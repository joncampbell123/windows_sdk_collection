<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 3.0, 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, versions 3.0, 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In versions of Microsoft Excel earlier than 4.0 for Windows, when a
worksheet, chart, or macro sheet containing links to a worksheet template
is open, and you then open the worksheet template, the template file is
opened in edit mode rather than as a template.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs with worksheet templates only. In addition, it occurs
regardless of whether you choose Open from the File menu, choose the
filename from the most recently used file list on the File menu, or use the
OPEN() macro function.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To open the worksheet template as a template (not in edit mode), you must
close files that are linked to it before you open the template.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This problem has been corrected in Microsoft Excel version 5.0.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, worksheets, charts, and macro sheets can be saved as
templates to be used when you want to create other documents that will have
similar format and content. The original template file can be opened for
editing by holding down the SHIFT key while selecting the filename in the
File Open dialog.
<P>
In Microsoft Excel for Windows, the file opens as FILENAME.XLT, and in
Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, it opens as FILENAME. When simply
opening
the template, it will open as FILENAMEn, where n is a number corresponding
to the number of times the template has been opened in the current session
of Microsoft Excel.
<P>
If an open worksheet, chart, or macro sheet is linked to a worksheet
template and this template is then opened, the template does not open
as FILENAMEn as expected, it opens for editing as FILENAME.XLT
(Windows) or FILENAME (Macintosh).
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Enter the following into a new worksheet:
<P>
<P><PRE>    A1: 1
    A2: 2
    A3: 3
    A4: 4
</PRE>
<P><LI>Save the worksheet as a template file by choosing Save As from the
   File menu. Depending on your platform and version, select one of
   the following:
<P>
   Microsoft Excel for Windows 4.0
   -------------------------------
<P>
<P><PRE>    a. Select Template from the Save File As Type list box.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    b. In the File Name box, type "Test" (without the quotation marks)
       and choose OK.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    c. The file will be saved as TEST.XLT.
</PRE><P>
   Microsoft Excel for Windows 3.0
   or Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh 3.0 and 4.0
   -------------------------------------------------
<P>
<P><PRE>    a. Choose the Options button.
</PRE><P>

</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    c. In the File Name box, type "Test" (without the quotation marks)
       and choose OK.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    d. In Microsoft Excel for Windows, the file will be saved as TEST.XLT
       and in Microsoft Excel the for Macintosh, the file will be saved
       as TEST.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Select cells A1:A4 and create a chart by pressing the F11 key.

<P><LI>Activate TEST.XLT (Windows) or TEST (Macintosh) by selecting the
   filename from the Window menu.

<P><LI>Choose Close from the File menu to close the template.

<P><LI>Open TEST.XLT (Windows) or TEST(Macintosh) by selecting the file
   from the File Open dialog box.
<P>
</OL>The template will not open as TEST1 but instead as TEST.XLT (Windows)
or TEST (Macintosh). To open the template as TEST1, the chart must be
closed first and the template file reopened.
