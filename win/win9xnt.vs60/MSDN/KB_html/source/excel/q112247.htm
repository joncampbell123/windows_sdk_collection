<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article tells you how to get information you need from the online Help
system (in case you don't have the printed documentation) and how to
install Help and the online tutorial if they are not currently installed on
your system.
<P>
NOTE: The Microsoft Excel "User's Guide," Chapter 5 (starting on page 49)
includes a concise explanation of the documentation included with Microsoft
Excel.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Getting Information from the Online Help System
 
<P>
If your installation of Microsoft Excel is part of a network site license,
ask your supervisor, network , or training personnel whether you can obtain
the printed documentation. This includes the "User's Guide," and the
"Visual Basic User's Guide."
<P>
If your organization's site license does not include printed documentation,
you can use the online Help and tutorial lessons. For an online
introduction to Help, look at the topic "Getting Information While You
Work."
<P>
To display "Getting Information While You Work" in Microsoft Excel:

<OL><P><LI>Start Microsoft Excel.

<P><LI>From the Help menu, choose Search For Help On.

<P><LI>Type "Help, described" (without the quotation marks), and then choose
   the Show Topics button.

<P><LI>Choose the Go To button. Help displays the topic "Getting
   Information While You Work."

<P><LI>Select one of the topics (underlined phrases)to learn more about
   using Help and the other documentation included with Microsoft
   Excel.
<P>
</OL><h3>Installing the Online Help System and Tutorial</h3>
 
<P>
Your copy of Microsoft Excel includes a complete online Help system
and online tutorial lessons. However, these files may not have been
installed on your system. If the MS Excel Setup icon is available in
the program group in which you installed Microsoft Excel, you can
install the online help and tutorial files yourself by following the
procedure given below.
<P>
If you installed Microsoft Excel from floppy disks, have them ready.
You will be prompted for some of them if you complete the installation
procedure below.
<P>
If you installed Microsoft Excel from a network server, consult your
network administrator before proceeding. Also refer your network
administrator to the file NETWORK.TXT (Windows) for instructions on
automatically installing Microsoft Excel or its components (such as Help)
from a network server.
<P>
To install the online Help and tutorial files:

<OL><P><LI>In Microsoft Excel for Windows, open the program group in which you
   installed Microsoft Excel, for example the Microsoft Office program
   group.

<P><LI>Double-click the MS Excel Setup icon.

<P><LI>Choose the Add/Remove button.

<P><LI>Under Options, select the Online Help And Lessons check box.

<P><LI>Choose the Change Option button.

<P><LI>Under Options, select all the online Help and tutorial file options
   you want installed. For the general Microsoft Excel Help and online
   tutorial lessons, select the Help For Microsoft Excel and Examples
   And Demos check boxes.

<P><LI>Choose the OK button.

<P><LI>Choose the Continue button.

<P><LI>Follow the Setup instructions on the screen.
