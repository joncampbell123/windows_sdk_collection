<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
There are 14 chart types in Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows. Each of the
14 chart types has several subtypes or variations. This article describes
each type of chart and what type of data it best represents.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Area Chart Type</h3>
 
<P>
An area chart emphasizes the magnitude of change over time. By displaying
the sum of the plotted values, an area chart also shows the relationship
of parts to a whole.
<P>
<P><h3>Bar Chart Type</h3>
 
<P>
A bar chart illustrates comparisons among individual items. Categories
are organized vertically, values horizontally, to focus on comparing
values and to place less emphasis on time. Stacked bar charts show the
relationship of individual items to the whole.
<P>
A 3-D bar chart emphasizes the values of individual items at a specific
time or draws comparisons between items. The subtypes stacked and 100-
percent stacked bar charts show relationships to a whole.
<P>
<P><h3>Column Chart Type</h3>
 
<P>
A column chart shows data changes over a period of time or illustrates
comparisons among items. Categories are organized horizontally, values
vertically, to emphasize variation over time. Stacked column charts show
the relationship of individual items to the whole.
<P>
A 3-D column chart shows a 3-D view of a column chart in one of two
variations: simple 3-D and 3-D perspective. The simple 3-D column displays
the column markers along the x (or category) axis. The 3-D perspective
chart compares data points along two axes: the x axis and the y (or series)
axis. In both chart variations, the data series are plotted along the z
axis. This chart type allows you to compare data within a data series more
easily and still be able to view the data by category.
<P>
<P><h3>Line Chart Type</h3>
 
<P>
A line chart shows trends in data at equal intervals. Although line charts
are similar to area charts, line charts emphasize time flow and the rate of
change, rather than the amount of change or the magnitude of values.
<P>
A 3-D line chart shows a 3-D view of a line chart as 3-D ribbons. This
chart type is often used to display data attractively for presentations.
<P>
<P><h3>Pie Chart Type</h3>
 
<P>
A pie chart shows the proportional size of items that make up a data
series to the sum of the items. It always shows only one data series and
is useful when you want to emphasize a significant element. To make small
slices easier to see, you can group them together as one item in a pie
chart and then break down that item in a smaller pie or bar chart next to
the main chart.
<P>
<P><h3>XY (Scatter) Chart Type</h3>
 
<P>
An xy (scatter) chart either shows the relationships among the numeric
values in several data series or plots two groups of numbers as one series
of xy coordinates. It shows uneven intervals, or clusters, of data and is
commonly used for scientific data. When you arrange your data, place x
values in one row or column, and then enter corresponding y values in the
adjacent rows or columns.
<P>
<P><h3>Doughnut Chart Type</h3>
 
<P>
Like a pie chart, a doughnut chart shows the relationship of parts to a
whole, but it can contain more than one data series. Each ring of the
doughnut chart represents a data series.
<P>
<P><h3>Radar Chart Type</h3>
 
<P>
In a radar chart, each category has its own value axis radiating from the
center point. Lines connect all the values in the same series. A radar
chart compares the aggregate values of a number of data series.
<P>
<P><h3>Surface Chart Type</h3>
 
<P>
A surface chart is useful when you want to find optimum combinations
between two sets of data. As in a topographic map, colors and patterns
indicate areas that are in the same range of values.
<P>
A 3-D surface chart shows a 3-D view of what appears to be a rubber sheet
stretched over a 3-D column chart. Surface charts are useful for finding
the best combinations between two sets of data. This chart can be used to
show relationships between large amounts of data that may otherwise be
difficult to see. As in topographic maps, colors or patterns indicate areas
that are of the same value. The colors do not mark the data series. The
wire frame format displays the data in black and white. The contour chart
formats provide a 2-D view of the data from above, similar to a 2-D
topographic map.
<P>
<P><h3>Bubble Chart Type</h3>
 
<P>
A bubble chart is a type of xy (scatter) chart. The size of the data
marker indicates the value of a third variable. To arrange your data,
place the x values in one row or column, and enter corresponding y
values and bubble sizes in the adjacent rows or columns.
<P>
<P><h3>Stock Chart Type</h3>
 
<P>
The stock chart is often used to illustrate stock prices. This chart can
also be used for scientific data, for example, to indicate temperature
changes. You must organize your data in the correct order to create this
and other stock charts. A stock chart that measures volume has two value
axes: one for the columns that measure volume, the other for the stock
prices. You can include volume in a high-low-close or open-high-low-close
chart.
<P>
<P><h3>Cone, Cylinder, and Pyramid Chart Types</h3>
 
<P>
The cone, cylinder, and pyramid data markers can lend a dramatic effect
to 3-D column and bar charts.
