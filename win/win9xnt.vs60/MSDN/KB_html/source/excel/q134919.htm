<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, a shared file may not reflect the changes you expect
when rows or columns of information are deleted by another user.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When you delete a row or column on a worksheet in a shared workbook, if
another cell on the worksheet contains a reference to that row or column,
the reference is lost. If another user has the file open when you delete
the row or column, and if they choose to use their changes when they save
the shared file, the deleted row or column may be added back to the file.
However, if a cell on the shared worksheet contains a reference to the
deleted row or column, the reference is not restored.
<P>
For example, if cell A2 on a shared worksheet contains a reference to cell
A1 on the worksheet, cell A2 returns the #REF! error value when you delete
row 1 on the worksheet. If another user has the file open when you delete
row 1, they receive the Conflict Resolution dialog box when they save the
file. If this user chooses to use the changes they made to the file, row 1
is not deleted on their instance of the shared worksheet, and the reference
is not broken. However, cell A2 on your instance of the worksheet now
contains =#REF! instead of the formula =A1 as expected.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft products listed
at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will
post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
