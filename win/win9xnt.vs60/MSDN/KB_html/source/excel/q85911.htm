The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 4.0, 4.0a, 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, versions 4.0, 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Two Microsoft Excel Add-in file functions, OPEN.DIALOG and SAVE.DIALOG
(from FILEFNS.XLA), were inadvertently omitted from the "Microsoft
Excel Function Reference." The README.TXT file refers to On-Line Help
to learn more about these functions but the reference to these
functions in On-Line Help is incorrect. This article contains
corrected information about these functions.
<P>
In Microsoft Excel version 5.0, there is no separate "Function Reference."
The OPEN.DIALOG and SAVE.DIALOG functions are no longer part of the add-
ins. For information on these functions, from the Help Menu, choose
Contents and then Reference Information. In the General Reference section,
choose Microsoft Excel Macro Functions Contents. Now choose the Search
button and type OPEN.DIALOG or SAVE.DIALOG to access the information you
need.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
OPEN.DIALOG and SAVE.DIALOG are file functions that are made available by
loading FILEFNS.XLA from the Library directory, a subdirectory of the
Microsoft Excel directory. In Microsoft Excel 4.0 for the Macintosh, these
functions are made available by loading the File Functions add-in located
in the Macro Library Folder. For more information on loading add-ins, see
"Managing Add-in Commands and Functions" in Chapter 4 of the Microsoft
Excel User's Guide 2.
<P>
OPEN.DIALOG displays the Open dialog box. This is the same dialog box that
appears when you choose Open from the File menu. It returns the name of the
file that is chosen. The syntax is as follows:
<P>
OPEN.DIALOG(file_filter,button_text,title,filter_index)
<P>
file_filter: A text string that determines what type of files will be
displayed in the dialog box. All files will be displayed if file_filter is
omitted. Below is an example of what the file_filter argument might look
like to show add-in, text, and Lotus 1-2-3 files:
<P>
<PRE>   text_description1, filter1, text_description2, filter2...

   (for example, "Add-In,*.XLA,Text,*.TXT,Lotus 1-2-3 Files,*.WK?")

</PRE>In Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, the "file_filter" argument is looking
for a 4 character file type (as in Type &amp; Creator). An example would be
"TEXT" for TeachText documents. A resource editor that returns the file
type like RESEDIT could give you this information.
<P>
button_text: The button_text argument is ignored under Excel for Windows.
In Excel for the Macintosh, this argument is the text you want to appear on
the Open Button of the dialog box.
<P>
title: In Microsoft Excel for Windows, this argument is a text string for
the dialog box title. In Excel for the Macintosh, this argument is ignored.
<P>
filter_index: A numeric value representing the starting position in the
file_filter list. In the sample file_filter list above, if the filter_index
argument was equal to 2, the initial filter would be Text, *.TXT. If the
number is outside the correct range for the given file_filter list or is
omitted, the initial filter will be the first one in the list. In Excel for
the Macintosh, this argument is ignored.
<P>
SAVE.DIALOG displays the Save dialog box. This is the same dialog box that
appears when you choose Save from the File menu. It returns the filename
entered by the user. The arguments for SAVE.DIALOG are the same with one
exception. The syntax is as follows:
<P>
SAVE.DIALOG(init_filename,title,button_text,file_filter,filter_index)
<P>
init_filename: The default file name in the form of text.
<P>
<P><h3>Example</h3>
 
<P>
=OPEN.DIALOG("Add-In,*.XLA,Text,*.TXT,Lotus 1-2-3 Files,*.WK?",,
<PRE>   "Custom Open Dialog",2)

</PRE>=SAVE.DIALOG("newfile.XLA","Custom Open Dialog",,
<PRE>    "Add-In,*.XLA,Text,*.TXT,Lotus 1-2-3 Files,*.WK?",2)
