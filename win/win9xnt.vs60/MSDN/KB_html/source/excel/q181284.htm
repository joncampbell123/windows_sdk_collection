The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition, when you save a workbook in an
earlier version format, for example, in any of the following formats
<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft Excel 5.0/95 Workbook
   Microsoft Excel 4.0 Worksheet
   Microsoft Excel 3.0 Worksheet
   Microsoft Excel 2.2 Worksheet

</PRE>you may receive multiple error messages that are similar to the following:
<P>
<PRE>   A formula in a cell (Cell:B7) could not be converted because it
   contains a function that is not available in the file format to which
   you are saving. If you continue the save, the formula and result will
   be saved, but the function itself will be converted to an error value.

    -and-

   Microsoft Excel cannot convert some of the cells. The total number of
   errors found is 3.

    -and-

   This workbook contains features that are not supported by the file
   format that you selected. To avoid the possible loss of formatting or
   information, be sure to save a copy in the most recent Microsoft Excel
   Workbook format.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs if either of the following conditions is true:

<UL><LI>The workbook or worksheet you are saving contains formulas that use
   functions that do not exist in the earlier version of Microsoft Excel.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE>
<LI>Functions in your formulas refer to arguments that do not exist in the
   earlier version of Microsoft Excel.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design of Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If the workbook or worksheet contains functions or arguments that are not
supported in earlier versions of Microsoft Excel, you receive the error
messages in this article when you save a file in a file format for an
earlier version of Microsoft Excel.
<P>
If you save the file in the format for an earlier version, first save a
copy of the workbook in the Microsoft Excel Workbook format (for Microsoft
Excel 98 Macintosh Edition version). This step ensures that you do not
permanently lose any of your formulas or formatting.
<P>
The worksheet functions that are available in Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh
Edition are NOT available in the versions of Microsoft Excel that are
listed in the following table.
<P>
<PRE>   Excel 98
   Function       7.0   5.0   4.0
   ------------------------------

   AMORDEGRC                   x
   AMORLINC                    x
   AVERAGEA        x     x     x
   CONCATENATE                 x
   COUNTBLANK                  x
   COUNTIF                     x
   GETPIVOTDATA    x     x     x
   HYPERLINK       x     x     x
   MAXA            x     x     x
   MINA            x     x     x
   POWER                       x
   ROMAN                       x
   ROUNDDOWN                   x
   ROUNDUP                     x
   SQLREQUEST                  x
   STDEVA          x     x     x
   STDEVPA         x     x     x
   SUBTOTAL                    x
   SUMIF                       x
   VARA            x     x     x
   VARPA           x     x     x

</PRE>NOTE: An "x" means the function is not available in the version of Excel.
<P>
Note that Microsoft Excel 7.0 is available only for Microsoft Windows 95
and Microsoft Windows NT. There is no Macintosh version of Microsoft Excel
7.0.
<P>
In addition, there are other functions, such as VLOOKUP, HLOOKUP, DAYS360,
and WEEKDAY, that accept more arguments in Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh
Edition than they do in earlier versions of Microsoft Excel.
<P>
<P><h3>The "Cannot Convert" Error Message</h3>
 
<P>
The "Microsoft Excel cannot convert some of the cells" error message
reports a varying number of errors. This number depends on the file format
in which you save the workbook or worksheet. This behavior occurs for the
following reasons:

<UL><LI>Functions and arguments that are supported in one earlier version of
   Microsoft Excel (for example, version 5.0) may not be supported in
   another earlier version of Microsoft Excel (for example, version 4.0).

<LI>Depending on how you enter formulas in your worksheets, some cells that
   contain unsupported functions or arguments may not be reported. This
   behavior occurs if any of the cells that contain the formulas are using
   "shared" formulas. If cells contain shared formulas, the number reported
   by the error message may be smaller than you expect.
<P>
</UL>The difference in the number of reported cells is not cause for concern;
however, you should be aware of the difference. Make sure you save a copy
of the workbook in the Microsoft Excel Workbook format to avoid losing
formulas or formatting.
