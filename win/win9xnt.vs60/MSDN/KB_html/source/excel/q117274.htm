The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Query for Windows, version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Query version 1.0 for Windows, you may have a problem deleting
records from within Microsoft Query even if the Show Deleted Records option
is cleared (not selected) in the ODBC setup dialog box for the dBASE
driver. In Microsoft Query, when you delete the records, the records may
still be displayed even though Show Deleted Records is not selected.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
During the setup for Microsoft Excel version 5.0 for Windows , when the
ODBC drivers and the ODBC Control Panel setup are installed, the "Show
Deleted Records" is not selected in the setup dialog box for the ODBC dBASE
Setup dialog box. However, contrary to what the dialog box displays, the
option to "Show Deleted Records" is in fact turned on in the ODBCISAM.INI
file which is located in the Windows directory. Therefore, when you delete
dBASE records from within Microsoft Query, they are still displayed, but
they are marked for deletion.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in
Microsoft Excel for Windows version 5.0c.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To correct this situation, do the following to modify the ODBCISAM.INI
file:

<OL><P><LI>In Windows Program Manager, choose Run from the File menu.

<P><LI>In the Command Line box, type ODBCISAM.INI, and choose the OK button.

<P><LI>The [dBase ISAM] section will contain the entry
<P>
<P><PRE>      Deleted = on
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    change this reference to the following:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>         Deleted = off

</PRE><P><LI>Save the ODBCISAM.INI file and restart Microsoft Query for this
   change to take effect.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
With dBASE files you have the option of displaying or not displaying
deleted records. When a record is deleted in a dBASE file, the record is
marked as deleted so that when the option "Show Deleted Records" is not
selected, those records marked for delete are not displayed. To either
actually delete records that are marked for delete in dBASE files or to
remove the delete mark from records in dBASE files, you must use an
application or utility that will provide these features. Microsoft Query
version 1.0 does not provide these features.
