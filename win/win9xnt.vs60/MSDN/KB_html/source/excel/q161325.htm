<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The File Conversion Wizard (Fileconv.xla) is an add-in which converts one
or more files from their native file formats to the Microsoft Excel file
format. This add-in is included with Microsoft Excel 97.
<P>
NOTE: The File Conversion Wizard is not installed when you perform a
Typical installation of Microsoft Excel.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This section describes what to do in each step of the wizard when you run
it. Each description is followed by an example.
<P>
NOTE: To start the File Conversion Wizard, point to Wizard on the Tools
menu, and then click File Conversion. Note that you must open a workbook
before you use the File Conversion Wizard. If you do not open a workbook
when you start the wizard, you receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   The File Conversion Wizard needs to be run from a workbook. Open a
   workbook and start again.

</PRE><h3>Step 1 of the Wizard</h3>
 
<P>
Determine the type and location of the file you want to convert.
<P>
In this step, select the folder in which the files are located and select
the file type. If necessary, change the folder for the selected drive.
Also, you must specify the format for the files that you are converting.
<P>
The Next button is unavailable until you select a folder location that
contains files that use the file format you specified.
<P>
<P><h3>Step 2 of the Wizard</h3>
 
<P>
To add the files that you want to convert to the Files To Convert list, do
either of the following:

<UL><LI>To select a single file, click the file, and then click Next.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE>
<LI>To select all the files, click Select All.
<P>
<P>
</UL><h3>Step 3 of the Wizard</h3>
 
<P>
The final step in the wizard allows you to specify the location in which
you want to save the converted files. You may type the path for the new
files or browse through the folders and select one. Also, you can save the
converted files in a new folder.
<P>
After the File Conversion Wizard converts all of the selected files, a
report that shows the results of the conversion appears. Please note that
the File Conversion Wizard does not delete the original files.
