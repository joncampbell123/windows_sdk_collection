<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you click either a View Access Form or a View Access Report button,
located on your Microsoft Excel worksheet, you may receive one of the
following error messages:
<P>
<PRE>   Cannot find the Access form for this list, possibly the form has been
   deleted. Create new form?

   -or-

   Cannot find the Access report for this list, possibly the report has
   been deleted. Create new report?


</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
You may receive either of the these error messages if you do the following:
<P>
<PRE>   Click either Access Form or Access Report on the Data menu.

   -and-

   Click Cancel in either the Microsoft Access Form or Report Wizard dialog
   box.

</PRE>Even though you canceled the procedure to create either a Microsoft Access
form or report, a button for either the form or report (depending upon
which one you tried to create) is still created on your Microsoft Excel
worksheet.
<P>
If you receive the error message, your options are to either click the Yes
or the No button in the error dialog box. If you click the Yes button, the
Microsoft Access Form or Report Wizard (depending on which one you tried to
create) is started and you can try to create another Microsoft Access form
or report. If you click the No button, the error dialog box is dismissed.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
If you cancel either the Microsoft Access Form or Report Wizard, as
described in the previous section, you might want to delete the View Access
Form or the View Access Report buttons that generate this error. To delete
these buttons from your worksheet, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Use the right mouse button to click the button.

<P><LI>On the shortcut menu that appears, click Cut.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you create an Access form or report from data on your worksheet using
the AccessLinks add-in provided with Microsoft Excel, a button is added to
the worksheet that contains your data to access the report or form that you
created.
<P>
This problem occurs when you click the View Access Form or View Access
Report button because Microsoft Access attempts to open the form or report
associated with your data. However, this form or report was never created
because you canceled out of the Microsoft Access Form Wizard.
<P>
