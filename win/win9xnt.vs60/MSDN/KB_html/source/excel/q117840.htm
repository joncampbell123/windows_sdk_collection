The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Microsoft Excel for Windows, version 5.0
 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Excel 5.0 for Windows may not be able to function properly as an
Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) 2.0 server if OLE 2.0-related entries in
the REG.DAT file are missing, damaged, or corrupted.
<P>
If you attempt to embed a Microsoft Excel version 5.0 object into another
application when either of these conditions are true, you may receive
either of the following error messages:
<P>
<PRE>   The action cannot be completed because EXCEL is busy.

   -or-

   The server application, source file, or item cannot be found.
   Make sure the application is properly installed, and that it has
   not been deleted, moved, or renamed.

</PRE>You may also lose your ability to drag selections from one OLE 2.0-
compliant application to another.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you embed a Microsoft Excel 5.0 object in another application, such as
Microsoft Word 6.0 for Windows, the following entries must be present in
the REG.DAT file (located in the WINDOWS directory) in order for the
embedding process to function properly:
<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft Excel 5.0 Application
   Microsoft Excel 5.0 Chart
   Microsoft Excel 5.0 Worksheet
   OLE (Part 1 of 5)
   OLE (Part 2 of 5)
   OLE (Part 3 of 5)
   OLE (Part 4 of 5)
   OLE (Part 5 of 5)

</PRE>If any of these entries are missing, or if any of them are damaged or
corrupted, you may not be able to embed Microsoft Excel 5.0 objects in
other applications.
<P>
The first three entries shown above are automatically entered in the
REG.DAT file every time you start Microsoft Excel version 5.0.
When you launch Microsoft Excel, it registers itself by copying
information from the EXCEL5.REG file (located in the Microsoft Excel
directory) to the REG.DAT file.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Note that the five OLE entries are not automatically reregistered if they
are deleted or if they become damaged or corrupted. In order for these
entries to be replaced, do the following to reregister the OLE2.REG file
with the REG.DAT file:

<OL><P><LI>Start File Manager.

<P><LI>Switch to the WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory.

<P><LI>Select the OLE2.REG file.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Run.

<P><LI>In the Run dialog box, choose OK.
<P>
</OL>You should receive a message similar to the following:
<P>
<PRE>   Information in C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\OLE2.REG has been successfully
   registered in the registration database.

</PRE><P><LI>Choose OK.
<P>
</OL>In extreme cases (for example, if the above steps do not allow Microsoft
Excel 5.0 objects to be embedded into other applications), you may need to
totally rebuild the REG.DAT file. For more information about rebuilding the
REG.DAT file, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:
