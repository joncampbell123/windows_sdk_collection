The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, version 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel version 5.0, when you run a Visual Basic, Applications
Edition, macro that displays a dialog box while there are no documents in
the application window, and if a control is assigned to the dialog box that
opens, unhides, or adds a workbook when the dialog box is dismissed or
hidden, you may experience the following problems:

<UL><LI>The "No Documents" menu bar is still displayed when the dialog box is
   dismissed (even though there may be a document in the application window
   once the dialog box is closed).
<P>
   -and-

<LI>If you attempt to exit Microsoft Excel in this state, you may receive a
   general protection (GP) fault, and receive the error message:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Excel caused a General Protection Fault in module EXCEL.EXE at
      0042:0CBE
</PRE><P>
</UL><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, create a macro that displays the dialog box
and, if OK is clicked, adds a new workbook after the dialog box is hidden.
When you assign macros to controls on a dialog sheet, the macro is run and
then the dialog box is hidden.

<P>
<P><h3>Example</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Close all open documents.

<P><LI>Create a new workbook by clicking New on the File menu.

<P><LI>On the Insert menu, click Macro, and then click Module to insert a
   new module in the workbook.

<P><LI>Type the following code on the module sheet:
<P>
<P><PRE>     Sub ShowDialogToAddWorkbook()
     Dim Response as Integer
<PRE></PRE>                 Response = Thisworkbook.DialogSheets(1).Show
          If Response then Workbooks.Add
     End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>On the Insert menu, click Macro, and then click Dialog to insert a
   dialog sheet in the workbook.

<P><LI>Hide this workbook by clicking Hide on the Window menu.
<P>
</OL>The application window should be empty (there are no documents visible).

<OL><P><LI>On the File menu, click Macro, select the ShowDialogToAddWorkbook
   macro, and click Run. When the dialog box is displayed, click OK.
<P>
</OL>A new workbook will appear in the window and the worksheet menu bar will be
displayed.
<P>
<P><h3>Alternate Workaround</h3>
 
<P>
Set the Visible property of the Workbook where your Dialogs(x).Show
statement is contained to True prior to executing the Dialogs(x).Show
statement. Return it to False after the dialog is dismissed.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in
Microsoft Excel for Windows version 5.0c.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>

the following conditions:
