<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If Microsoft Excel encounters a quotation mark (") when opening a text
file and does not encounter a second quotation mark within 256
characters, the text file being read may be truncated at that point.
<P>
Excel sees the first quotation mark as the start of a string. If the
second quotation mark (closing quotation mark) is not encountered
within 256 characters (the maximum number of characters in a cell), it
may not be seen by Excel. Because all information after the 256th
character in a cell is truncated, the remainder of the file (and the
second quotation mark, if there is one) is truncated.
<P>
To correct this problem, open the text file in a word processor and
use the word processor's search and replace feature to remove all the
quotation marks in the file. If some quotation marks are necessary,
make sure that for every opening quotation mark there is a closing
quotation mark, and that the opening and closing quotation marks are
within 256 characters of each other (this includes spaces).
