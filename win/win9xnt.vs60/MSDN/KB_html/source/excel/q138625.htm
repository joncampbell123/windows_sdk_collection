<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you attempt to open a Lotus 1-2-3 file that is in a WK1 format in
Microsoft Excel, foreign characters and squares may appear instead of data.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior may occur when you use a third-party add-in called SQZ!,
which compresses Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet files. Note that the file name
extensions for files that are compressed by SQZ! are changed from WK1 to
WK!.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To open and view the file in Microsoft Excel, first reopen the file in the
version of Lotus 1-2-3 in which you created it, remove the SQZ! add-in and
save the file.  Be sure to save the file without having any third-party add-
ins installed.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
SQZ! is manufactured by Lotus Development Corporation, a vendor independent
of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this
product's performance or reliability.
