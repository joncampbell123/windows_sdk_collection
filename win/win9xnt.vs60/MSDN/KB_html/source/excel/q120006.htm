The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, version 5.0c
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0
<LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
</UL> 
 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The files on Disk 2 and later of the Setup program for Microsoft Excel for
Windows are stored in cabinet files on DMF-formatted disks. If you need to
copy the files from the disks to a network server or other permanent
storage drive, you must use the copy switch (/c) with the Extract.exe
utility located on Disk 1 to copy the program files to the target location.
<P>
Extract.exe allows you to copy the entire cabinet file (*.cab) or extract
and decompress individual files contained in the cabinet file. You can also
use the Extract utility to search a cabinet file and list its contents.
<P>
To obtain a complete list of command options for Extract, insert Disk 1 and
switch to the drive containing the disk. For example, type "A:" (without
quotation marks) if the disk is in drive A. Type "extract" or "extract /?"
(without quotation marks) at the command prompt to obtain a list of
commands for Extract.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
A cabinet (*.cab) file contains many files stored as a single file. The
following are examples that show how to use the Extract command to copy and
extract files from a cabinet file and how to locate the files contained in
a cabinet file.
<P>
<P><h3>Copying an Entire *.Cab File</h3>
 
<P>
The following examples demonstrate how to use the Extract command to copy
the entire cabinet file to another location.
<P>
To copy a cabinet file named Excel2.cab to the current directory, use the
following syntax:
<P>
<PRE>   extract /c a:\excel2.cab excel2.cab

</PRE>To copy a cabinet file named Excel2.cab to the directory C:\Disk2, use the
following syntax:
<P>
<PRE>   extract /c a:\excel2.cab c:\disk2\excel2.cab

</PRE><h3>Copying Files from a *.Cab File</h3>
 
<P>
Below are some examples of how to copy all of the files from a cabinet
file.
<P>
To copy all of the files from all cabinets on all disks to the directory
C:\Flat:
<P>
<PRE>   extract /e /a /l c:\flat a:\excel1.cab

</PRE>NOTE: The /a switch extracts all files beginning with the first cabinet, so
Disk 1 should be in drive A when you use Extract with this switch.
<P>
To copy all of the files from the Excel4.cab cabinet to the current
directory, use the following syntax:
<P>
<PRE>   extract /e a:\excel4.cab

</PRE><h3>Locating a File in a *.cab File</h3>
 
<P>
If you need only a single file that is contained in one of the cabinet
files, you can search for it using the /d switch with Extract.exe. After
you find the file, you can use Extract.exe again to copy the file to the
desired location. The following examples show how to use the extract
command to find files.
<P>
To list all files in a cabinet file, use the following syntax:
<P>
<PRE>   extract /d a:\&lt;cabinet filename&gt;

</PRE>To list all *.exe files in a cabinet file, use the following syntax:
<P>
<PRE>   extract /d a:\&lt;cabinet filename&gt; *.exe

</PRE><h3>Copying a Single File from a *.Cab File</h3>
 
<P>
The following are examples of how to use Extract to copy a single file from
a cabinet file.
<P>
To extract Any.exe to the current directory, use the following syntax:
<P>
<PRE>   extract a:\&lt;cabinet filename&gt; any.exe

</PRE>To extract Any.exe to C:\Excel, use the following syntax:
<P>
<PRE>   extract a:\&lt;cabinet filename&gt; any.exe /l c:\excel
