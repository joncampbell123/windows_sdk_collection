<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition

<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you attempt to add a new chart to a workbook in Microsoft Excel
98 Macintosh Edition, you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Not enough memory.

</PRE>If you are using a Visual Basic for Applications macro to add chart sheets
to a workbook, you may also receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Run-time error '1004':
   Method 'Add' of object 'Sheets' failed

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may occur if you add more than 123 or 124 charts to a workbook
in Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition. This is a limitation in Microsoft
Excel 98 Macintosh Edition.
<P>
Note that the problem may occur when you add fewer than 124 charts,
especially if you use multiple fonts in worksheets in the workbook
or if you use embedded charts. Also, note that if the workbook contains
charts that have been added in earlier versions of Microsoft Excel, the
workbook may contain more than 124 charts.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
You may be able to work around this limitation by clearing the Auto
Scale option for fonts in charts. To do this, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Select the chart area.

<P><LI>On the Format menu, click Selected Chart Area.

<P><LI>Click the Font tab.

<P><LI>Click to clear the Auto Scale check box.

<P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
</OL>In addition, you may be able to work around this limitation by moving some
of the charts in your workbook into another workbook. Note that charts
moved to another workbook remain linked to the data in the original
workbook.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition, there is a limit of 256 fonts that
may be used by the program. When you create a chart, the chart uses two
fonts if the Auto Scale check box for that chart is selected (the default
behavior in Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition). For example, it is
possible to exceed the limit of fonts by creating a workbook that contains
the objects that are listed in the following table.
<P>
<PRE>   Objects                      Fonts per object         Fonts used
   ----------------------------------------------------------------

   124 chart objects            2 fonts                   248 fonts
   1 worksheet                  1 font                      1 font
   used by Microsoft Excel      6 fonts                     6 fonts

                                                   Total  255 fonts

</PRE></OL>If you attempt to add another chart to the workbook, the total number
of fonts used would be 257. Because this would exceed the limit of 256
fonts, you receive a "Not enough memory" error message.
<P>
Clearing the Auto Scale check box for each chart may allow you to extend
the maximum number of charts that can be added to the workbook.
