<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 2.x, 3.0, 4.0, 4.0a
<LI>Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, versions 2.x, 3.0, 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you transfer files from Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh to
Microsoft Excel for Windows, you may encounter linking problems if you are 
working with linked files.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem with linked files occurs because the Macintosh operating
system allows you to create filenames that can exceed the
eight-character limit imposed by MS-DOS. In addition, the Macintosh
operating system allows you to include spaces and almost all
punctuation in a filename.
<P>
Because of these differences in filenames, if a file is transferred
(regardless of whether it is by Apple File Exchange or over a network), the 
possibility exists that the filename will be truncated. A truncated 
filename will impair any links that exist between the worksheets: since the 
name of the file has changed, Microsoft Excel will not be able to locate 
the file to which the link is pointing.
<P>
Note that Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0, and Microsoft Excel 
97 for Windows both support long file names. For this reason, the problem 
described above will be much less likely to occur when using these versions 
of Microsoft Excel.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, either:

<UL><LI>Use the MS-DOS file naming conventions when you name your files on the
   Macintosh: that is, use an eight character filename with a three
   character filename extension. For example, name your file EXPENSES.XLS
   instead of ExpenseReport.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE>
<LI>If you don't want to use the MS-DOS file naming conventions, you will
   need to re-establish the links between the files after you have
   transferred them to Microsoft Excel for Windows. To re-establish these
   links, do the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>    1. Open the dependent file (the file that is linked to the source data
       file). If the source file is unopened, the dependent file will
       prompt you with the question "Update references to unopened
       documents?" Click No.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    2. On the File menu, click Links. A dialog box labeled Links will
       appear with a list of all the available links in the worksheet.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       NOTE: The listed links will contain the Macintosh filenames (the
       long versions of the filenames).
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    3. Press the TAB key to select the link that you want to change, and
       then click Change.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    4. In the Change Links dialog box, choose the source file from the
       list of files (bearing in mind that it has a new truncated name),
       and click OK. This will return you to the previous screen, at which
       point you should click either Close or OK.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       When you return to the worksheet, you will notice that the link has
       been updated.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    5. Save the file.
</PRE><P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If the links on the worksheet point to a function macro on a macro
sheet, you must manually open the macro sheet the first time you want
to use it.
