<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, when you create a pivot table, and you group items in
the table by month, not all of the months are displayed, and some months
are duplicated.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs if the date used in the Starting At box in the
Grouping dialog box is the 31st day of a month. The problem occurs because
not all months have a 31st day. In this case, the 31st day wraps to the 1st
day of the next month, creating a duplicate month label, as well as leaving
out the label for the month that doesn't have a 31st day.
<P>
For example, if the dates in your pivot table include Jan, Feb, and Mar of
1994, and you group your data by months, starting at 1/31/94, the resulting
table has the month labels Jan, Mar, and Mar, where the first Mar label
actually represents the data for February.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To avoid this behavior when you use the Grouping dialog box to group data
in your pivot table by months, make sure that the Starting At box contains
a date other than the 31st of a month. If the 31st of a month is displayed
in this box, and the Auto check box next to this box is selected, clear the
Auto check box, and enter a starting date that is not the 31st of a month.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft
products listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was
corrected in Microsoft Excel version 5.0c for Windows.
