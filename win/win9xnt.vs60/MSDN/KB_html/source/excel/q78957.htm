The information in this article applies to:

</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The custom help file conversion utility for Microsoft Excel that is
available through Microsoft Product Support includes the compiler
HC.EXE, which is necessary to create Windows help files.
<P>
All of the features of a help file - including context strings,
inserting graphics images, key words, and cross reference jumps - can
be implemented using this compiler.
<P>
You can use HC.EXE to create more advanced custom help screens in
Microsoft Excel for Windows as well as for Microsoft Excel for OS/2.
<P>
To obtain the application note "Microsoft Excel Custom Help File
Conversion Utility," which includes HC.EXE, call Microsoft Product
Support Services at (425) 454-2030.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
HC.EXE is a program that ships in the Windows Software Development Kit
(SDK). It is documented in chapters 15-19 of the "Tools" manual that
comes with the Windows SDK. This manual is also published as
"Microsoft Windows Programming Tools," and under this title is
available separately through Microsoft Press.
<P>
Microsoft Excel for OS/2 uses a set of Windows libraries that are
exactly the same as the Windows Help engine. Therefore, help files
created with HC.EXE can be run from Microsoft Excel for OS/2 with no
changes.
