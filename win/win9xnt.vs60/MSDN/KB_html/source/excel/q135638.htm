The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, when you open a workbook that you used to create a
Microsoft Access Form or Report, you may receive the following error
message when you click the View Access Form or View Access Report button:
<P>
<PRE>   Cannot open the form or report associated with this list.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs if you save the file you used to create the list for
the report or form with another filename, and you click the button in
this file to view the form or report.
<P>
When you create an Access form or report from data on your worksheet
using the AccessLinks add-in provided with Microsoft Excel, a button is
added to the worksheet that contains your data to access the report or form
that you created. However, when you click this button, if the name of the
workbook that contains this worksheet is different than it was when the
form or report was created, you receive the error message described above.
<P>
This problem occurs because when you click the View Access Form or View
Access Report button, Microsoft Access attempts to open the form or report
associated with your data. However, this form or report is attached to the
workbook with the original filename (the filename of the workbook that was
active when you created the form or report), which is different from the
filename of the active file. If the filename of the active workbook is not
the same as the filename of the workbook that you used to create the form
or report, the form or report is not opened, and you receive the error
message described above.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this behavior, use any of the following methods:
<P>
Method 1: Save or rename the file that contains your data to the original
<PRE>          filename; that is, the filename that the workbook had when you
          created the Access form or Access report.

</PRE>Method 2: If the original file that contains your data still exists, open
<PRE>          this file. If this file does not already contain the View
          Access Report or View Access form button, create the form or
          report from this file.

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
