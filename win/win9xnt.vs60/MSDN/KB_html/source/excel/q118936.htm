The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 4.0, 4.0a, 5.0, 5.0c
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, versions 7.0, 7.0a
<LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Works for Windows, version 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you create a spreadsheet in Microsoft Works version 3.0 and save it as a
Microsoft Excel 4.0/5.0 worksheet, the worksheet may not be recalculated as
expected: dependent formulas are not recalculated as expected and may
return the #VALUE! error value, and cells that are dependent on other cells
(that is, cells that refer to other cells) may not be recalculated
automatically.
<P>
NOTE: This problem occurs even when calculation option is set to automatic
and there are no circular references.
<P>
In addition, Microsoft Works files opened in Microsoft Excel may not
contain the correct information for the formula type. For example, although
a formula, such as =RAND(), may return a numerical value, you may not be
able to use it as an argument of a numerical parameter of a function. Thus,
when a cell containing a formula is referred by another cell, it may return
an error value such as #NAME.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
To update the formulas in Microsoft Excel, do any of the following:

<UL><LI>After you open the data in a Microsoft Excel worksheet, you can manually
   edit and update the cells that were not recalculated correctly. To edit
   the cell, press the F2 key and then press ENTER (without changing the
   contents of the formula).
<P>
   -or-

<LI>To transfer a file from Microsoft Works to Microsoft Excel, save it as a
   Works for Windows 2.0 spreadsheet or a Lotus WK1 spreadsheet. Currently,
   you cannot open Microsoft Works 3.0 spreadsheets in Microsoft Excel
   versions 5.0, 7.0, or 97.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Works version
3.0. This problem has been corrected in Microsoft Works version 3.0a.

</PRE>You can save a Microsoft Works 3.0 spreadsheet file as a Microsoft Excel
4.0 or 5.0 worksheet by choosing the Excel 4.0/5.0 format in the Microsoft
Works Save As dialog box.
