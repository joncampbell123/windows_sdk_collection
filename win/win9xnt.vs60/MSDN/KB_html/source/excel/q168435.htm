The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, versions 7.0, 7.0a
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0c
</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, there are limits to the maximum times that you can
enter into a cell or return by using a formula. This article explains the
limits in different versions of Microsoft Excel.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, versions 5.0 and later, you can enter times that exceed
24 hours by using a number format that includes "[h]" (without the
quotation marks). The square brackets around the "h" instruct Microsoft
Excel calculate times beyond 24 hour intervals, which allows you to enter
times that exceed 24 hours. If you enter a time that exceeds 24 hours,
Microsoft Excel automatically applies a number format that includes the
"[h]" code.
<P>
There are limits that apply to times that use this format. If you enter a
time into a cell or use a formula to return a time that exceeds the
limits, you may notice either of the following problems:

<UL><LI>If you enter a time that exceeds the limits, the time may appear as a
   text string.
<P>
   For example, if you enter the following time in Microsoft Excel 97
<P>
<P><PRE>      20000:00:00
</PRE><P>
   the time appears in the cell as a text string aligned to the left.

<LI>If you use a formula to return a time that exceeds the limits, the
   formula returns a series of pound or number signs (####).
<P>
   For example, if you use the following values and formulas in a
   worksheet in Microsoft Excel 5.0
<P>
<P><PRE>      A1: 12/31/2078 23:00:00
      A2: 1:00:00
      A3: =A1+A2
</PRE><P>
   the formula returns a series of pound signs because the time returned by
   the formula exceeds the maximum time for Microsoft Excel 5.0.
<P>
</UL><h3>Microsoft Excel for Windows, version 5.0</h3>
 
<P>
The maximum time that you can enter into a cell is 1569143:59:59. This time
is equivalent to 12/31/2078 23:59:59, which is the maximum time you can use
in these versions of Microsoft Excel.
<P>
The maximum time that you can calculate using a formula is also
1569143:59:59.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 5.0c, 7.0, 7.0a</h3>
 
<P>
The maximum time that you can enter into a cell is 9999:59:59. If you enter
a time that is greater than or equal to 10,000 hours (10000:00:00), the
time appears as a text string.
<P>
The maximum time that you can calculate using a formula is 1569143:59:59.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows</h3>
 
<P>
The maximum time that you can enter into a cell is 9999:59:59. If you enter
a time that is greater than or equal to 10,000 hours (10000:00:00), the
time appears as a text string.
<P>
The maximum time that you can calculate using a formula is 71003183:59:59.
This time equates to 12/31/9999 23:59:59, which is the maximum time you can
use in Microsoft Excel 97.
