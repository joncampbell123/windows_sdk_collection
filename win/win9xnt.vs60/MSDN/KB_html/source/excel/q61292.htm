<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When Microsoft Excel performs "intelligent recalculation," it
determines which cells to recalculate based on those cells that are
dependent on the cell that has changed.
<P>
For example, if you make a change to cell A1, all the cells that base
their result on A1 are put into a recalculation chain. Excel then
starts recalculating those cells.
<P>
If other cells are dependent on those cells that are included in this
calculation chain, Excel recalculates those cells also.
<P>
However, at some point, Excel determines that it is quicker to
recalculate the whole worksheet, rather than to find out which cells
need to be recalculated separately.
<P>
To suppress calculation after every entry, set calculation to Manual,
by choosing Calculation from the Options menu and selecting Manual.
<P>
Manual calculation sets Excel to recalculate only when Calculate Now
is chosen from the Options menu or COMMAND+= is pressed on the
keyboard.
<P>
Note: When in manual calculation mode, Excel performs a full worksheet
recalculation when a recalculation is performed.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To determine which cells are dependent on a particular cell in Excel
2.20, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Select the supporting cell or range of cells.

<P><LI>From the Formula menu, choose Select Special.

<P><LI>Click Dependents and click All Levels.

<P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
</OL>All cells that depend on the supporting cell(s) will be highlighted.
