<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In some circumstances, PINGing a NetBIOS name (with the PING utility) 
returns a reply, but other commands such as NET USE or NET VIEW to the 
NetBIOS name do not complete successfully. In some cases this is due to 
the fact that the PING utility uses ICMP packets and does not require a 
session to be established, whereas the NET Commands require a session to 
be established.
<P>

<P>
Troubleshooting Procedure When You Can PING by NetBIOS name, but cannot 
use the NET command:

<OL><P><LI>If this occurs only across a router, check to see if TCP Port 139 is
   enabled.
<P>
   The NET commands relies on TCP Port 139. To enable this port the
   administrator of the router should be contacted. If further help is
   needed, contact the router manufacturer's technical support.

<P><LI>If this occurs only across a router, check to see if the Router is
   unable to Pass the Large Packet Sizes.
<P>
   The PING utility sends 74 bytes of data. It is possible that the PING
   requests can pass through the router, but not the larger NET requests.
   The following procedure can be used to see if packet size is the
   problem:
<P>
   A. Use PING -L &lt;buffer size to send&gt;". For example:
<P>
<PRE>         PING &lt;computername&gt; -l 4048
         PING &lt;computername&gt; -l 3036
         PING &lt;computername&gt; -l 2024
         PING &lt;computername&gt; -l 1012

   B. Edit the registry to specify a smaller packet size.

</PRE><P><LI>Check to make sure the Server Service is started on the computer in
   Control Panel, Services.
<P>
   If the Server Service is not started, that computer still responds to
   the PING utility, but a session cannot be established. Start the Server
   Service in Control Panel, Services.

<P><LI>Check to make sure the destination computer is not hung.
<P>
   If the destination computer is hung, it is possible for the PING 
   utility to receive a response even though a session cannot be 
   established.
<P>
   Take appropriate steps to restore the hung computer. Reboot, repair, or
   reinstall as necessary.

<P><LI>Check to make sure the destination computer has a valid license.
<P>
   If there are no licenses available for the destination computer, it
   still responds to the PING utility, but it is unable to establish a
   session.

<P><LI>Verify if DNS or a HOSTS file is in use. Since the HOST name resolution
   methods are used first ping may be resolved, yet NET USE may timeout
   before the HOST methods can be utilized.
<P></OL>
