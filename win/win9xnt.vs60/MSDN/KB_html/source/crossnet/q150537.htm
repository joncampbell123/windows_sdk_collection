                                  reported at any time if the Windows

   WSASYSNOTREADY         10091   Returned by WSAStartup(), indicating that
                                  the network subsystem is unusable.
   WSAVERNOTSUPPORTED     10092   Returned by WSAStartup(), indicating that
                                  the Windows Sockets DLL cannot support
                                  this application.
   WSANOTINITIALISED      10093   Winsock not initialized. This message is
                                  returned by any function except
                                  WSAStartup(), indicating that a
                                  successful WSAStartup() has not yet been
                                  performed.
   WSAEDISCON             10101   Disconnect.
   WSAHOST_NOT_FOUND      11001   Host not found. This message indicates
                                  that the key (name, address, and so on)
                                  was not found.
   WSATRY_AGAIN           11002   Nonauthoritative host not found. This
                                  error may suggest that the name service
                                  itself is not functioning.
   WSANO_RECOVERY         11003   Nonrecoverable error. This error may
                                  suggest that the name service itself is
                                  not functioning.
   WSANO_DATA             11004   Valid name, no data record of requested
                                  type. This error indicates that the key
                                  (name, address, and so on) was not found.
