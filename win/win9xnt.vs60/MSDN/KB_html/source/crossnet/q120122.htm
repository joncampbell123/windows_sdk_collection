The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft TCP/IP-32 for Windows for Workgroups, version 3.11
<LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Network DDE Windows-based applications (like File Manager) fail to operate
successfully between Windows for Workgroups workstations configured with
TCP/IP-32 when they are in different sub-nets connected by routers. The
following error message appears:
<P>
<PRE>   The computer name specified in the network path cannot be located

</PRE>You can observe workstations with a protocol analyzer. Unsuccessful
Name Query requests broadcasted to the local sub-net are transmitted by
workstations to resolve the name of the workstation in question:
<PRE>"computername   &lt;1F&gt;".

</PRE>The NET USE command functions correctly.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The NetBIOS naming table on the workstation does not include the name
required by Network DDE for computer names specified in the LMHOSTS file.
This problem only occurs under TCP/IP-32 if you use the #PRE keyword.
<P>
When a name entry is parsed from the LMHOSTS file, three entries are added
to the workstation's NetBIOS naming table. These are added to provide the
computer name, messenger, and server functionality:
<P>
<PRE>   computername   00h
   computername   20h
   computername   03h

</PRE><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>TCP/IP-16 Real Mode</h3>
 
<P>
Use the ADDNAME2 keyword available from the LAN Manager resource kit. The
following syntax adds an additional entry which can then be saved to the
LMHOSTS file:
<P>
<PRE>   addname2 "computername   " /p0x1f

</PRE>The entire length of the name must be 16 characters including the hidden
character (1f) in the 16th place. You must pad the computer name with
spaces so that it equals 15 characters in length.
<P>
<P><h3>TCP/IP-32 for Windows for Workgroups 3.11</h3>
 
<P>
TCP/IP-32 can add the required NetBIOS name (if you are using the #PRE
keyword) by having the two following lines in the LMHOSTS file of each
remote computer:
<P>
<PRE>   ipaddr computername #PRE
   ipaddr "COMPUTERNAME   \0x1F" #PRE

</PRE>NOTE: The computer name in quotation marks on the second entry must equal
16 characters in length, and it must be in uppercase. The #PRE keyword is
optional for the second entry above. #PRE speeds up resolution of the
Network DDE name which helps to provide a successful connection accross
routers providing a dialup or delayed remote link.
