The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5 and 3.51
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5 and 3.51
<LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
A Windows for Workgroups 3.11 client, running IPX and connecting to an
Windows NT version 3.5 or 3.51 Server or Workstation by default uses direct
hosting. Direct hosting is a method of bypassing the NetBIOS layer and
sending client/server messages (SMBs) directly over the transport, in this
case, IPX.
<P>
If the Windows for Workgroups 3.11 client is using an Open Datalink
Interface (ODI) driver rather than an NDIS driver, the client may drop
packets from the server and lose the connection.
<P>
This is most evident where you have large file reads and a fast server.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
You may be able to improve the connection reliability by not using direct
hosting from client to server. This forces NetBIOS to manage the session,
rather than making the redirector manage retransmissions. To turn direct
hosting off at the client, add the following parameter to the [network]
section of system.ini:
<P>
<PRE>   directhost=no

</PRE>Note: Page 4-12 of the "Windows for Workgroups Resource Kit", Addendum for
Version 3.11 incorrectly states this parameter as 'directhosting'. This is
a documentation error.
<P>
Additionally, you must install the IPX/SPX Compatible Transport with
NetBIOS on the Windows for Workgroups client.
<P>
When you turn direct hosting off, large file read requests from the client
are requested in a read block raw SMB, and the data is transferred over the
NetBIOS session. The following trace shows at frame 20, the client
initiates a read block raw, and the data is returned by the server over the
NetBIOS session:

</PRE>If direct hosting is on, then the redirector initiates a read block
multiplex, and the data is sent back in read block multiplex response SMBs,
directly over IPX. The following trace shows a read block multiplex coming
from the client at frame 19. Frames 20 through 29 show the server
responding with read block multiplex responses, and frame 30 is another
read block multiplex command from the client:

</PRE>In this case, the redirector is responsible for requesting resends of lost
packets in either direction. This may be too much of a burden on the
Windows for Workgroups redirector which is running over an ODI driver. The
extra layer needed to map NDIS 3.0 protocols to an ODI NIC driver
(MSODISUP.386) may also contribute to the problem, as running direct
hosting over NDIS drivers does not seem to exhibit this problem.
