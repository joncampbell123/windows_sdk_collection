The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5 and 3.51
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5 and 3.51
<LI>Microsoft TCP/IP-32 for Windows for Workgroups, versions 3.11, 3.11a,
   and 3.11b
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOM</h2>
 
<P>
The TCP/IP protocol fails after you start your computer when you use the
following operating system and protocols and enable DHCP:

<UL><LI>Windows for Workgroups with TCP/IP-32.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Windows 95 with TCP/IP.
<P>
</UL>This problem occurs when at least one network device has a static TCP/IP
address.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
After a TCP/IP address conflict, your Windows for Workgroups DHCP client
fails to send a DHCPDECLINE packet and therefore fails to obtain a valid
DHCP TCP/IP address from the Windows NT DHCP server.
<P>
This problem occurs on a Windows NT DHCP network where your Windows for
Workgroups DHCP client obtains a dynamic TCP/IP address that is identical
to the static TCP/IP address of another network device.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem:

<OL><P><LI>Prevent this TCP/IP address conflict from reoccurring by:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Excluding the static TCP/IP address from the range of dynamic TCP/IP
      addresses on the Windows NT DHCP server.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      -or-
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - Configuring the static TCP/IP network device to use a TCP/IP address
      that does not fall within the dynamic TCP/IP address range of the
      Windows NT DHCP server.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Request a new TCP/IP address for your Windows for Workgroups client from
   the Windows NT DHCP server:
<P>
   a. In a MS-DOS command window of Windows for Workgroups, type:
<P>
<PRE>         ipconfig /release

   b. Type:

         ipconfig /renew

</PRE></OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.5 and
3.51, and in Microsoft TCP/IP-32 for Windows for Workgroups version 3.11,
3.11a, and 3.11b. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Windows for Workgroups DHCP client accepts the dynamic TCP/IP address
from the Windows NT DHCP server and sends an ARP (Address Resolution
Packet) packet to make sure there is no other computer with the same
address on the network. The TCP/IP network device with the static address
replies, indicating that it has the same address. This causes the TCP/IP
protocol on your Windows for Workgroups DHCP client to shut down even
though it is supposed to send the DHCPDECLINE packet to the Windows NT DHCP
server to obtain a valid TCP/IP address. The TCP/IP client with the static
TCP/IP address shows a message that there is a conflict but it functions
normally.
