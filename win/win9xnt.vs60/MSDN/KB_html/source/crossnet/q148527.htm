The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5 and 3.51
<LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Windows 95 browser service has the capability to act as a subnet master
browser for a domain, in a routed TCP/IP network. This effectively means
that a Windows 95 computer can behave like a Windows NT computer in that it
will share the local subnet browse list with the Windows NT Domain Master
Browser (DMB). Note the Windows NT DMB is also the Primary Domain
Controller (PDC).
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The behavior of the Windows 95 browser service is almost exactly the same
as in Windows NT 3.5, 3.51, and Windows for Workgroups 3.11 (using TCP/IP-
32b and the updated redirector files from NT Server 3.51 compact disc).
<P>
When a Windows 95 computer is elected to become master browser on the
network segment, it will contact the Domain Master Browser every 12 to 15
minutes to share browse lists.
<P>
During this transaction, Windows 95 will request the domain browse list
from the DMB, which includes the list of computers in the local domain as
well as the list of other domains. The DMB will then request the “local
segment browse list” that the Windows 95 computer has compiled, and then
merge it with the domain list.
<P>
Thus, the Windows 95 machine will have a compiled domain browse list (local
list &amp; DMB list), and the DMB will always have a complete domain-wide
browse list of all remote segments that have “domain members”
<P>
NOTE: in this context, a “domain member” is an Windows NT machine that has
joined the domain, or any Microsoft network client which is part of a
workgroup (name) that is identical to the domain (name).
<P>
The requirements for this functionality are:

<UL><LI>The Windows 95 workgroup name must be the same as the domain name. This
   then qualifies the Windows 95 machine as a “domain member”  for the
   purposes of this topic.

<LI>One of the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - All clients and servers must be Windows Internet Naming Service
      (WINS) enabled, and be able to resolve their DOMAIN&lt;1B&gt; name thru
      WINS. (The DOMAIN&lt;1B&gt; name can only be registered by the Primary
      Domain Controller.)
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      -or-
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - If the network does not utilize WINS, you may still have limited
      domain browsing functionality by specifying special names in the
      LMHOSTS file.
