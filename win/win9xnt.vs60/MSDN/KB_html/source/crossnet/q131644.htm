<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When a LAN Manager or Windows for Workgroups client runs a directory
search against files on a Windows NT share that reside on an NTFS drive,
the time stamp displayed could be off by as much as two seconds.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The "Windows for Workgroups 3.1a" dialect is negotiated for Windows for
Workgroup clients and "DOS LANMAN2.1" is negotiated for a LAN Manager
clients. The SMB command that is issued for these dialects for directory
searches is File Search. This command returns the Last Modify Time through
the find_buf_time field (which displays only the modification time in two
second increments). This is an SMB specification for the "File Search"
command find_buf_time field. The application running on the LAN Manager or
Windows for Workgroups computer can display only what the SMB passes to it.
In this case, it is passing a file time stamp that has been rounded off by
two second increments.
<P>
Windows NT computers negotiate a dialect of "NT LM 0.12" which uses the
TRANSACT2_FINDFIRST function from the SMB specification for directory
searches. The TRANSACT2_FINDFIRST function does not have this two second
time stamp limitation.
<P>
For example, a LAN Manager or Windows for Workgroups computer will see a
file on a Windows NT share that resides on an NTFS drive with a time stamp
(last modify time) of 12:30:52.0. A Windows NT computer will see that same
file with a time stamp (Last Write Time) of 19:30:50.674. Convert this time
stamp to Pacific Daylight Savings Time and it will be 12:30:50.674.
