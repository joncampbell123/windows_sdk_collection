The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Internet Information Server version 2.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you apply Service Pack 1 for Windows NT 4.0 to Windows NT Server
4.0, the following dialog message will appear:
<P>
"You have a domestic-version 128-bit PCT/SSL security provider installed on
your machine. This Update contains only an export grade version 40-bit
PCT/SSL security provider. Select Cancel to skip copying this file. Your
original 128-bit security provider will be left intact. Please see the
readme.txt for information on obtaining the updated 128-bit security
provider."
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The version of Windows NT Server 4.0 that is installed has Internet
Information Server 2.0 installed, and the Service Pack has an updated file
used by Internet Information Server that the service pack will replace if
allowed to do so.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs only if
<P>
<PRE>   the Windows NT Server 4.0 is running the Internet Information Server 2.0
   web services

</PRE>-and-
<P>
<PRE>   it is using SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) that requires 128-bit encryption.

</PRE>If 128-bit encryption is required and you are in the U.S. or Canada, follow
Resolution A. If 128-bit encryption is not required or you are not in the
U.S. or Canada, follow resolution B.
<P>
<P><h3>Resolution A:</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Click the Cancel button to keep the existing file in place.

<P><LI>Restart the server after the Service Pack is applied.
<P>
   Internet Information Server will run with the older version of the file,
   but the security provider will eventually need to be replaced because of
   fixes and enhancements.
<P>
</OL>The updated 128-bit security provider (the complete Service Pack, except
with the 128-bit security provider) can be obtained by calling:
<P>
<PRE>   (800) 631-8906 in the US

   (800) 933-4750 in Canada

</PRE></OL>NOTE: The domestic (128-bit) version of the Service Pack is intended for
distribution only in the United States and Canada. Export of the domestic
version of this service pack from the United States is regulated by the
International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR, 22 CFR 120-130) of the
U.S. State Department, Office of Defense Trade Controls. A State Department
license is required to export the domestic version of the Service Pack
outside the United States or Canada.
<P>
NOTE: Another option, if you need the full line of 128-bit encryption, is
to order the Encryption Pack, which includes 128-bit encryption for RAS,
Internet Explorer 3.0, and SSL for Windows NT Workstation and Server 4.0.
The Encryption Pack can be ordered by calling:
<P>
<PRE>   (800) 370-8758 in the US

   (800) 260-6579 in Canada

</PRE><h3>Resolution B:</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Click OK to allow the Service Pack to overwrite the existing security
   provider.

<P><LI>Restart the server after the Service Pack is applied.
<P>
   Internet Information Server will run with the 40-bit version of the
   security provider if SSL is used, otherwise it should not affect the
   operation of Internet Information Server.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
The Readme.txt file included with all Service Packs for Windows NT 4.0 from
SP2 and greater now include a section on how to obtain the 128-bit
encryption components described in this article. Please refer to the
Readme.txt file for the most current information.
