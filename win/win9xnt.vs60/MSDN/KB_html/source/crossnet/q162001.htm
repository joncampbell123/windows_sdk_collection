<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft provides several methods for the proper deployment of the
Windows NT operating system. The use of a supported method is very
important to ensuring the security of the systems running Windows NT
is not compromised.
<P>
There is a reason you can't just copy the hard disk from one computer to
another to deploy Windows NT. One of the important features of Windows NT
is its security. Each computer is assigned a unique Security ID (SID)
during Setup at the time the machine name is entered; this ensures that it
can be identified on the network. Almost all of the network services have
this security information encoded in their entries in the registry during
Setup or subsequent installation. Simply copying the contents of one hard
disk to another would give each computer the same SID, making security
impossible to maintain.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When a computer is installed, it is given a SID. For a Windows NT
Workstation, Windows NT Member server, or a Windows NT primary domain
controller (PDC), that SID is computed to contain a statistically unique
96-bit number. For a Windows NT backup domain controller (BDC), that SID
is identical to the SID of the PDC for the domain.
<P>
The primary SID is generated during the installation of Windows NT and is
the prefix of the SIDs for all the user accounts and group accounts
created on the computer. The SID is concatenated with the RID of the
account to create the account's unique identifier.
<P>
So, if two workstations have the same primary SID, the first user account
generated (and so forth) on each workstation is the same because the SID
on both computers is the same.
<P>
Here is what happens when the SID is created. When you install Windows NT,
Setup creates a unique SID for that computer and uses this SID as a prefix
for all local machine accounts. This can be seen by using Regedt32.exe to
view the local user's SID. If you create several local accounts you will
see the SID for that account when logging on as that user.
<P>

   Example:

   S-1-5-21-191058668-193157475-1542849698-500       administrator
   S-1-5-21-191058668-193157475-1542849698-1000      User one
   S-1-5-21-191058668-193157475-1542849698-1001      User two
   S-1-5-21-191058668-193157475-1542849698-1002      User three

</PRE>Notice that only the last four digits are incremented as new accounts are
added. The implication of this for Workgroup security is that local users
have rights on other computers according to the order the account in which
was created. Additionally, the impact on file ownership for
shared/removable media will be compromised and would make security
unmanageable.
<P>
The "after GUI replication" method is unsupported because of the security,
resource ownership and unmanageability implication.
<P>
Because the SID identifies the computer or domain as well as the user, it
is critical that it be unique to maintain support for current and future
applications.
<P>
Microsoft Policy Statement
<P>
Microsoft does not provide support for systems that have been installed by
duplicating fully installed copies of either Windows NT Workstation and
Server or Windows 95. Microsoft supports using disk duplication as a
method of distribution for Windows NT 4.0 if the disk is duplicated at
the point in the Windows NT 4.0 setup process after the second reboot and
before the graphical mode portion of Windows NT 4.0 setup.
<P>
Clarification
<P>
Essentially, this duplication consists of 'XCOPY' of the entire tree
structure after Windows NT has been installed, affecting security,
hardware and other areas of the product. More technical details below.
Windows NT 3.51 CPS and Windows NT 4.0 Deployment Tools, while unattended,
are not simple copies and do configure the operating system correctly.
<P>
<P><h2>REFERENCE</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Knowledge Base provides a variety of articles that outline
specifications and how to information for the proper deployment of Windows
NT.
<P>
The Windows NT 4.0 Workstation Resource Kit provides documentation on the
deployment procedures for Windows NT 4.0.
<P>
Consult the Computer Profile Setup documentation in the Windows NT 3.5 and
Windows NT 3.51 Resource Kits on deployment utilities.
<P>
Additional information about Windows NT deployment is available from the
following Microsoft Web site:
