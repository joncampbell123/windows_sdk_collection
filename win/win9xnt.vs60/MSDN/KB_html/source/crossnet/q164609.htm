<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you diagnose network traffic using a network analyzer, a large series
of address resolution protocols (ARPs) in sequential order may be detected.
This problem can cause network access and traffic to and from all hosts to
become temporarily disrupted. One of the possible causes of this behavior
is the result of Hewlett Packard's JetAdmin JetDirect discovery tool, which
is silently installed when a Hewlett Packard published driver is installed
in Windows from a disk. One of Hewlett Packard's JetAdmin 2.33 methods to
discover all JetDirect devices (printers) running TCP/IP requires that a
ping be sent to every address in the subnet. Although this may provide a
very thorough list of devices, it can also generate a huge amount of
network traffic. Take, for example, a Class A network address. If JetAdmin
were to run, approximately 7 million packets, in succession, will be
transmitted upon startup of this utility.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
There are two possible resolutions to this issue:

<UL><LI>Download JetAdmin version 2.40 from Hewlett Packard’s Web site. Hewlett
   Packard’s JetAdmin version 2.40 also provides discovery of printers
   through broadcasts, as well as the ping method described above.
   Additionally, the ping method has been modified in version 2.40 so that
   it will, by default, not send pings to more than 2000 addresses without
   modifying the registry.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Hewlett Packard's JetAdmin Tool version 2.33 is designed to work in the
   manner described. On the majority of networks where Class C subnets are
   used, this behavior will not be a problem because of the small number of
   broadcasts generated. However, if you have a subnetted class B or class
   A network, Microsoft recommends that you contact Hewlett Packard for
   further support. To disable this feature, a change in the Registry must
   be made. To make this change, perform the following steps:
<P>
   WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-
   wide problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT or Windows 95
   to correct them. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting
   from the use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own
   risk.
<P>
   1. Start the Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe for Windows NT and
<P><PRE>      Regedit.exe for Windows 95).
</PRE><P>
   2. Change the following key located under:
<P>
<PRE>         HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Hewlett-Packard\HPJetAdmin\TCPIP

   3. Change the Value for NoSubnetSearch to 1.

   In addition, if you run the JetAdmin application, the following option
   can be selected and disabled or enabled:

         Options\Preferences\TCPIP Discovery\Broadcast
