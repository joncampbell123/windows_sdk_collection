The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5 and 3.51
<LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11
<LI>Microsoft TCP/IP-32 for Windows for Workgroups version 3.11b
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Windows for Workgroups 3.11 browser service has been modified to allow
the Windows for Workgroups computer to act as a subnet master browser for a
domain, in a routed TCP/IP network. This effectively means that a Windows
for Workgroups computer can behave like a Windows NT computer in that it
will share the local subnet browse list with the Windows NT Domain Master
Browser (DMB). Note the Windows NT DMB is also the Primary Domain
Controller (PDC).
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Previously, a Windows for Workgroups master browser would not share its
browse list with the Windows NT PDC, if the PDC was on a different segment.
However, there are new updated files that allow a Windows for Workgroups
master browser to contact the Windows NT Domain Master Browser to “share”
browse lists.
<P>
This activity occurs approximately every 12 to 15 minutes. During this
transaction, Windows for Workgroups will request the domain browse list
from the DMB, which includes the list of computers in the local domain as
well as the list of other domains. The DMB will then request the “local
segment browse list” that Windows for Workgroups has compiled, and then
merge it with the domain list.
<P>
Thus, the Windows for Workgroups machine will have a compiled domain browse
list (local list + DMB list), and the DMB will always have a complete
domain-wide browse list of all remote segments that have “domain members”.
<P>
NOTE: in this context, a “domain member” is a Windows NT machine that has
joined the domain, or any Microsoft network client which is part of a
workgroup (name) that is identical to the domain (name).
<P>
The requirements for this functionality are:

<UL><LI>The Windows for Workgroups 3.11 client must be using the updated files
   on the Windows NT Server 3.51 compact disc in the directory
   \Clients\Wfw\Update. Copy these files over the existing ones in the
   \Windows and \Windows\System directory, and then restart Windows for
   Workgroups.

<LI>The Windows for Workgroups workgroup name must be the same as the
   domain name. This then qualifies the Windows for Workgroups machine as a
   “domain member” for the purposes of this topic.

<LI>One of the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - All clients and servers must be Windows Internet Naming Service
      (WINS) enabled, and be able to resolve their DOMAIN&lt;1B&gt; name through
      WINS. (The DOMAIN&lt;1B&gt; name can only be registered by the Primary
      Domain Controller.)
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      -or-
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - If the network does not utilize WINS, you may still have limited
      domain browsing functionality by specifying special names in the
      LMHOSTS file.
