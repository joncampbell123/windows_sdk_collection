<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Internet Information Server, version 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you try to access a mailbox on a computer running Microsoft Exchange
Server using the Exchange Active Server Components, you may receive the
following error upon trying to log on:
<P>
<PRE>   Failed to get Inbox.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This error is caused by an account permissions problem for the mailbox you
are trying to access. Verify that the Windows NT account you are signed in
as has permission to the Exchange Server mailbox you are trying to access.
<P>
This error typically occurs when you are using Window NT Challenge\Response
Authentication (also referred to as NTLM) to access Internet Information
Server.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem:

<UL><LI>Use only basic (clear text) authentication. You will be asked for user
   credentials every time you log on to your mailbox using a Web browser.
   If a higher level of security is needed, configure Secure Sockets Layer
   (SSL) to this computer running Internet Information Server. For extra
   security, use basic (clear text) authentication over the secure
   connection provided by SSL.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This error typically occurs when you are using Window NT Challenge\Response
Authentication (also referred to as NTLM) to access Internet Information
Server. Below is an example of the expected behavior you should see when
using Internet Explorer (IE), Exchange Active Server Components, and NTLM
authentication.
<P>
NOTE: Currently Netscape Navigator 2.0 and 3.0 do not support NTLM
authentication.
<P>
Configuration:

<UL><LI>IIS\Exchange Machine domain:  DomainA
<LI>Exchange Mailbox: User1
<LI>Exchange Mailbox Primary NT account: DomainA\User1
<LI>Windows NT Challenge\Response authentication enabled for IIS
<P>
</UL>Scenario:

<OL><P><LI>Logged on to the computer running Internet Explorer as DomainA\User1
   trying to access Mailbox User1.

</OL></UL><LI>With IE 3.0, you should be logged on to the mailbox normally.
<LI>With IE 3.01, you should be logged on to the mailbox normally.

</UL><OL><P><LI>Logged onto the computer running Internet Explorer as DomainA\User2
   trying to access Mailbox User1.

</OL></UL><LI>With IE 3.0, you will receive the "Failed to get Inbox" error message.
<LI>With IE 3.01, you will receive the "Failed to get Inbox" error message.

</UL><OL><P><LI>Logged on to the computer running Internet Explorer as DomainB\UserX
   (where UserX is any account) trying to access Mailbox User1.

</OL></UL><LI>With IE 3.0, you will receive the "Failed to get Inbox" error message.
<LI>With IE 3.01, you will receive be prompted to enter user name and
   password. Entering DomainA\User1 for the user name and the correct
   password should allow access to the mailbox.
