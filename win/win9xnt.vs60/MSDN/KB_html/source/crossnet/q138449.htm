<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Scope ID option in the TCP/IP configuration provides a way to isolate a
group of computers that only communicate with each other. The Scope ID is a
character string value that is appended to the NetBIOS name and is used for
all NetBIOS over TCP/IP communications from that computer. Other computers
that are configured with an identical Scope ID are able to communicate with
this computer, while TCP/IP clients with a different Scope ID disregard
packets from any other Scope ID.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In situations where troubleshooting TCP/IP connectivity is required, this
value should be checked on both the client and the server (or client to
client) computers to ensure that the Scope ID is identical. For example,
when a domain logon is attempted from a client computer, the Scope ID is
appended to the name of the domain as it is broadcast, and only domain
controllers listening for the same Scope ID are able to respond to the
request.
<P>
Additionally, the Scope ID is case-sensitive, so computers configured with
the Scope ID "scope" attempting to communicate with computers with Scope ID
"SCOPE" will be unable to communicate via NetBIOS over TCP/IP.
<P>
For Microsoft Windows 95, the Scope ID configuration can be found on the
"WINS Configuration" tab in the properties for TCP/IP in the Network
section of Control Panel. In Windows for Workgroups and Windows NT, this
can be configured from the Advanced options in the TCP/IP configuration
dialog box in the Networks section of Control Panel.
<P>
NOTE: You can still have non-NetBIOS communication with a computer with
a different scope id. Thus, you are able to ping, but error 53 appears
(network name not found) if you attempted to use NET VIEW to view the
computer.
