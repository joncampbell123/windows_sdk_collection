<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When troubleshooting a Microsoft application running on a network, the
following steps will help simplify the troubleshooting process:
<P>
Questions to ask:

<OL><P><LI>Does the problem occur on all workstations or to all users?
<P>
<P><PRE>    - If the answer is yes, and there is no record of the error
      message in the knowledge base, try to find some factors
      (hardware, software, and so on) that are common to all of the
      machines or all of the users.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - If the answer is no, and there is no record of the error
      message in the knowledge base, try to find common factors
      relative to those machines affected (similar software, hardware,
      and so on).
</PRE>
<P><LI>Does the problem occur when logged in as Supervisor?
<P>
<P><PRE>    - If the answer is yes, it is probably not a rights-related
      issue.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - If the answer is no, it is probably an issue related to the
      rights of the individual receiving the error message.
</PRE>
<P><LI>If the problem still is not solved, disable all non-network
   related programs from the AUTOEXEC.BAT, CONFIG.SYS, and login
   scripts (if applicable). If the problem still occurs, it is not
   related to software conflict.
<P>
</OL>Specific steps to follow if the network is Novell:

<OL><P><LI>If the application is Microsoft Word and the network is Novell,
   check to see if Word was started with the /N switch and if the
   MSWNET, for Word versions earlier than 5.50, or MSWNET55, for Word
   version 5.50, variable is set correctly.
<P>
<P><PRE>    - If the MSWNET was not set or set correctly, set the MSWNET
      (MSWNET55) variable through the login script or in the manner
      described in the "Setting Up Network Workstations for Multiple
      Users" application note.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Is the problem printing related?
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Type in CAPTURE SH at the DOS prompt. This command provides
      information on how Novell is capturing the data to the LPT port.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      If the TABS field displays NO CONVERSION, the job configuration
      is set to BYTESTREAM (appropriate for applications with a print
      driver). If the TABS field displays anything other than NO
      CONVERSION, it is set to TEXT (appropriate for applications
      without a print driver). See the PRINTCON menu and CAPTURE command
      line utilities in the "Introduction to Novell" section of the
      Novell documentation.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      If printing a large document or a document with numerous
      downloaded fonts or graphics, increase the time-out count for
      the job.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      If printing to a postscript printer, do not use a banner page.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - If printing problems still occur, follow the steps listed in
      "What to Do If a Network Printer Won't Print."
