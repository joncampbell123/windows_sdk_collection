</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article provides basic troubleshooting tips for configuring the
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) with Microsoft Windows for
Workgroups.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Troubleshooting Tips and Techniques</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Clean boot your computer by removing terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR)
   programs, and third party utilities from your CONFIG.SYS and
   AUTOEXEC.BAT configuration files. Remove or minimize the use of memory
   managers. Add back functionality until you discover the utility or
   combination of utilities that is creating undesirable effects.
<P>
   See the SETUP.TXT file included with Windows for Workgroups.

<P><LI>Verify that the clients PROTOCOL.INI and SYSTEM.INI files reflect your
   configuration. For more information:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - See section 9: Using Windows for Workgroups 3.11 with TCP/IP of
      the NETWORKS.WRI file in the Windows for Workgroups directory.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - See the DHCP Automatic Configuration section in the README.TXT file
      included with Microsoft TCP/IP-32 for Windows for Workgroups.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - See the Microsoft TCP/IP-32 Help file (MTCPIP32.HLP) included with
      Microsoft TCP/IP-32 for Windows for Workgroups. See the "Dynamic Host
      Configuration Protocol (DHCP)" section under Overview of Microsoft
      TCP/IP and the section titled "Configuration Settings in SYSTEM.INI
      and PROTOCOL.INI" under More Information On.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - Check the Network Adapter Card Setup Help file (WFWCARD.HLP) included
      with the Windows for Workgroups Resource Kit. You can also query in
      the Microsoft Knowledge Base on the name of your network interface
      card (NIC).
</PRE>
<P><LI>Force the Windows for Workgroups client to recreate the hidden DHCP
   configuration file (DHCP.BIN):
<P>
   a. Use the ATTRIB command to remove the hidden and read-only file
<P><PRE>      attributes.
</PRE><P>
   b. Delete the file.
<P>
   c. Quit and restart Windows for Workgroups to allow the file to be
<P><PRE>      recreated.
</PRE><P>
   The client automatically creates the DHCP.BIN (a hidden binary file) in
   the installation directory.

<P><LI>Verify the IP is functioning correctly by using ARP, PING, NBTSTAT,
   NETSTAT, TRACERT, and NET VIEW on the client computer.
<P>
<P><PRE>    - The on-line help available for each command by typing "/?" (without
      the quotation marks). For example:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>         NET VIEW /?

       For PING and TRACERT help, type the command without any parameters.

    - The Microsoft TCP/IP-32 Help file (MTCPIP32.HLP) included with
      Microsoft TCP/IP-32 for Windows for Workgroups includes specific
      instructions on using these tools. The help file also contains
      general troubleshooting tips in the "Troubleshooting with TCP/IP
      Diagnostics Utilities" topic in the Utilities and Services
      Reference section.

</PRE></OL><h3>Troubleshooting Utilities</h3>
 
<P>
You can run IPCONFIG on the client computer to check the client's IP
configuration. For more information:

<UL><LI>Review the Microsoft TCP/IP-32 Help file (MTCPIP32.HLP) included with
   Microsoft TCP/IP-32 for Windows for Workgroups. The help file includes
   specific instructions on using IPCONFIG in the "Troubleshooting with
   TCP/IP Diagnostics Utilities" topic in the Utilities and Services
   Reference section.

<LI>Query on the following words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<P><PRE>      DHCP and WFW
</PRE><P>
</UL>You can run DHCPADMN on the Windows NT Server to check the DHCP Server
Configuration. Use the Scope Active Leases option to verify that leasing is
occurring. For more information see:

<UL><LI>The Microsoft Windows NT Server TCP/IP manual, Chapter 4, Installing and
   Configuring DHCP Servers.

<LI>Knowledge Base article <B><A href="../winnt/q169289.htm">Q169289</A></B> titled "DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration
   Protocol) Basics."
<P>
</UL><h3>Troubleshooting Resources</h3>
 

<UL><LI>Check the Microsoft Windows NT Server Comprehensive Index for
   information on Clients.

<LI>Review the Microsoft Windows for Workgroups NETWORKS.WRI and SETUP.TXT
   files.

<LI>Review Microsoft TCP/IP-32 Help (MTCPIP32.HLP), included with Microsoft
   TCP/IP-32 for Windows for Workgroups.

<LI>Review the Microsoft Windows for Workgroups README.TXT file.

<LI>Review the Network Adapter Card Help (WFWCARD.HLP), included with the
   Microsoft Windows for Workgroups Resource Kit.

<LI>Additional information may be available in the Microsoft Knowledge Base.
