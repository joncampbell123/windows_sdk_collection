<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article explains how to log on to a Windows NT domain in Windows for
Workgroups by bypassing the logon screens. Consult with your network or
systems administrator to make sure this procedure does not violate your
network environment policies.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you start Windows for Workgroups, a dialog box appears that requests
your username and password. If you are a member of a domain, another dialog
box appears that requests your domain name, domain user name and domain
password. This article describes the following procedures:
<P>
<PRE>   - Bypassing Domain Logon
   - Bypassing Windows for Workgroups and Domain Logons

</PRE><h3>Bypassing Domain Logon</h3>
 
<P>
To bypass the Domain logon screen:

<OL><P><LI>Create or verify your user account and password in User Manager for
   Domains on the Windows NT Server.

<P><LI>If you have a user name and password for the Windows for Workgroups
   logon, use File Manager to search for a *.PWL file in the WINDOWS
   directory. The file name is usually the first eight characters of your
   user name with the PWL extension. For example, if your user name is
   Myname, then the file name is MYNAME.PWL. Delete the file.

<P><LI>In Control Panel Network, enter the default logon name and click
   Startup. Select the "Log On at Startup" and the "Log Onto Windows NT
   Domain" check boxes. Quit Control Panel Network and restart Windows for
   Workgroups.

<P><LI>An "Error 2: The specified file was not found" error message appears.
   This is expected because the *.PWL file does not exist. Click OK.

<P><LI>Enter a your user name and password in the Windows for Workgroups logon
   screen. Click OK. Click Yes to create the password list file (*.PWL).
   Then, confirm your password.

<P><LI>Enter your Windows NT domain user name and password in the Domain logon
   screen. Select the "Save this Password" check box and click OK.

<P><LI>If the Windows NT domain user name and password is valid, a message
   apears that indicates a successful logon to the domain. If you do not
   want this message to appear, click Startup in Control Panel Network.
   Clear the "Don't Display Message on Successful Logon" check box.

<P><LI>Log off and log back on using the Logon On/Off utility or the Log On/Off
   option in Control Panel Network. Only the Windows for Workgroups logon
   screen appears, bypassing the Windows NT domain logon screen.
<P>
</OL><h3>Bypassing Windows for Workgroups and Domain Logons</h3>
 
<P>
To bypass both the Windows for Workgroups and the Domain logon screens:

<OL><P><LI>Create or verify your user account and blank password in User Manager
   for Domains on the Windows NT Server.

<P><LI>If you have a user name and password for the Windows for Workgroups
   logon, use File Manager to search for a *.PWL file in the WINDOWS
   directory. The file name is usually the first eight characters of your
   user name with the PWL extension. For example, if your user name is
   Myname, then the file name is MYNAME.PWL. Delete the file.

<P><LI>In Control Panel Network, enter the default logon name and click
   Startup. Select the "Log On at Startup" and the "Log Onto Windows NT
   Domain" check boxes. Quit Control Panel Network and restart Windows for
   Workgroups.

<P><LI>An "Error 2: The specified file was not found" error message appears.
   This is expected because the *.PWL file does not exist. Click OK.

<P><LI>Enter the user name only in the Windows for Workgroups logon screen.
   Do not enter a password. Click OK. Click Yes to create the password list
   file (*.PWL). Do not enter a password for password confirmation. Click
   OK.

<P><LI>Enter your Windows NT domain user name only in the Domain logon screen.
   Do not enter a password. Select the "Save this Password" check box.

<P><LI>If the Windows NT domain user name and password is valid, a message
   apears that indicates a successful logon to the domain. If you do not
   want this message to appear, click Startup in Control Panel Network.
   Clear the "Don't Display Message on Successful Logon" check box.

<P><LI>Log off and log back on using the Logon On/Off utility or the Log On/Off
   option in Control Panel Network. Only the Windows for Workgroups logon
   screen appears, bypassing the Windows NT domain logon screen.
