<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The TCP/IP protocol may fail to start if another system using the same IP
address is detected on the network. All the TCP/IP protocols currently
shipping (as of 9/20/94) can detect duplicate IP addresses in most cases.
The following information details how this happens and how to recognize
duplicate addresses in a network trace.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Each computer running TCP/IP uses a cache that contains mappings between
IP addresses and media access control (MAC) or network adapter addresses
on the network. The cache is maintained by the address resolution protocol
(ARP) and is dynamic. When a connection attempt is made from one computer
to another, the calling computer looks in its ARP cache for the target
computer's IP/MAC address entry, and then builds an outgoing frame
directed to the MAC address of the target computer.
<P>
If the target computer's IP address is not in the cache, the calling
system broadcasts an ARP frame onto the network. The ARP frame contains
the IP address of the target computer, and requests its MAC address. If
the target computer exists on the local sub-net then an ARP reply will be
returned to the calling computer, which updates its cache accordingly. The
cache must contain correct mappings for communications to function.
<P>
At system startup, when the IP protocol initializes, it sends an ARP
request containing its own MAC and IP address so that other computers can
update their ARP caches. If there is already a computer using the IP
address, the "older" computer will respond with an ARP reply containing
its MAC and IP address, indicating a conflict. Unfortunately, many other
computers may have already updated their ARP caches with the new mapping.
At that point, the "younger" computer that is initializing needs to do two
things:
<P>
<PRE>   1. Repair the ARP cache on all affected computers.
   2. Cease using the duplicate address.

</PRE>Computers running Microsoft TCP/IP will send out a new ARP broadcast to re-
map the ARP cache on all affected computers. This new ARP will contain the
MAC address and IP address of the older owner of the IP address. After
sending this ARP, the IP protocol on the younger machine will report the
problem to the user and the stack will shut down. The stack should not be
re-started until a unique address is obtained. Note that the computer may
still function at this point if another protocol such as NetBEUI is
loaded.
<P>
Below is a network trace illustrating this behavior. It was captured on a
Token Ring network.

</PRE><h3>Windows NT version 4.0 Service Pack 3</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft changed the way a Windows NT TCPIP computer reacts to a duplicate
IP address with Service Pack 3. This change has not been made in any of the
other TCPIP stacks. The new method of resolving duplicate IP addresses is
as follows:

<OL><P><LI>The "new" machine broadcasts an ARP request with its own MAC address and
</OL>IP address.

<OL><P><LI>The "older" computer will send an ARP reply directly back to the "newer"
</OL>computer, indicating a conflict.

<OL><P><LI>The "newer" computer will not initialize its TCP/IP stack.

<P><LI>The "older" computer will send an ARP broadcast with its own MAC address
</OL>and IP address to ensure other computers have a correct ARP cache entry for
the IP address that was in conflict.
