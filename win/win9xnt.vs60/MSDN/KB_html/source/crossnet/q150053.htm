The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51, and 4.0
  -Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51, and 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Remote connection to a Windows NT domain fails using the Windows 95 Dial-Up
Networking (DUN) client. Your logon scripts will not run, and you get the
following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   No domain server was available to validate your password.
   You may not be able to gain access to some network resources.

</PRE>Following this error you may be prompted with the domain logon dialog box
requesting your user name, password, and domain name. In most cases you
will eventually be able to connect but without domain validation.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when you use a portable computer that was once
connected locally to a LAN through a network interface card (NIC). The
computer's NIC was not removed or disabled, and the first two octets of the
DHCP-assigned subnetted class B IP address are the same for both the NIC
and the dial-up adapter.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Create a hardware profile for remote connections that does not include the
NIC as part of the installed hardware.
<P>
NOTE: After you have configured more than one hardware profile for a
computer running Windows 95, a menu automatically appears during the
booting process listing all available hardware profiles as numbered
choices. The user may choose only one per computing session.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT and Windows 95.
We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
A potential fix for this issue is documented in the following article in 
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID:  <B><A href="../crossnet/q154434.htm">Q154434</A></B>
   TITLE:       Err Msg: No Domain Controller Was Available to
                Validate...

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This problem was reported by corporate users who normally connect their
portable computers to a corporate LAN when at the office. When they travel,
they use a Windows 95 DUN connection to access their company's network
resources.
<P>
The problem usually appears under the following circumstances:

<OL><P><LI>A portable computer running Windows 95 is connected to a local LAN using
   TCP/IP. The laptop NIC gets a DHCP-assigned, subnetted class B address.

<P><LI>Later, the computer is physically disconnected from the LAN, but the NIC
   remains in the computer.

<P><LI>From a remote location, the user attempts to dial in to an NT RAS server
   that allows access to the company's LAN.

<P><LI>The NT RAS server uses DHCP to assign an IP address to the remote DUN
   client.

<P><LI>If the first two octets of the subnetted class B address are the same
   for the client's NIC as for the PPP connection through the dial-up
   adapter, then the access problem may appear.
<P></OL>
