<P><h3>1.0  Introduction</h3>
 
<P>
The Microsoft TCP/IP-32 version 3.11b is the latest update to the TCP/IP-32
stack for Windows for Workgroups 3.11. It has been updated since version
3.11a and includes a number of fixes, primarily to provide compatibility
with several third-party WinSock applications, and to correct problems with
using DNS to resolve NetBIOS names. This also has updated code related to
Windows 95. This update is a complete refresh of TCP/IP-32 and contains all
components of the product.
<P>
This product is compatible with and supported exclusively on Windows for
Workgroups version 3.11. If you are running a different TCP/IP product on
your computer, you must remove it before installing Microsoft TCP/IP-32. If
you experience difficulties with another vendor's product, remove the
existing TCP/IP stack, exit Network Setup completely, reboot your system,
and then proceed to add the Microsoft TCP/IP-32 drivers by following the
instructions given in the documentation.
<P>
NOTE: When you upgrade to TCP/IP-32 3.11b, you should also update your
Windows for Workgroups operating system with the files found on the Windows
NT version 3.51 CD-ROM. This update is necessary to logon to a Windows NT
domain over routers when using TCP/IP-32 3.11b. These files are also
available on various electronic services in the self-extracting file,
WFWFILES.EXE. For additional information, please see the following article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : README.TXT: Windows for Workgroups Update Files

</PRE><h3>2.0  Installation Instructions for TCP/IP-32 3.11b</h3>
 
<P>
There are two ways you can install the TCP/IP-32 version 3.11b upgrade on
your computer. You can completely reinstall your TCP/IP-32 network protocol
stack with TCP/IP-32 3.11b, which will overwrite your previous TCP/IP
settings with default settings. Alternatively, advanced users can manually
copy just the updated binary files to the proper directories. This will
retain your TCP/IP-32 settings, but will not update the TCP/IP-32 version
number.
<P>
Complete Reinstall:

<OL><P><LI>From the Network group, choose the Network Setup icon.

<P><LI>Choose the Drivers button (Under Network Drivers, you will see your
   Network Interface Card (NIC) and the network protocols used on that
   NIC).

<P><LI>Select TCP/IP-32 3.11.

<P><LI>Choose the Setup button, review and write down all of your TCP/IP-32
   configuration information.

<P><LI>Choose the Cancel button to return to the Network Drivers dialog box.

<P><LI>If TCP/IP-32 3.11 is your only network protocol, then temporarily add
   the NetBEUI network protocol by following these steps:
<P>
<P><PRE>      A. Choose the Add Protocol button.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      B. Select Microsoft NetBEUI.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      C. Choose the OK button (Microsoft NetBEUI will appear under
<PRE></PRE>         Network Drivers).

</PRE><P><LI>Select TCP/IP-32 3.11.

<P><LI>Choose the Remove button and then the Yes button to confirm.

<P><LI>Choose the Add Protocol button.

<P><LI>Select Unlisted or Updated Protocol and Choose the OK button.

<P><LI>In the Install Driver dialog box, enter the path to the updated
<P><PRE>    TCP/IP-32 3.11b files (You should then see Microsoft TCP/IP-32
    3.11b in the Unlisted or Updated Protocol dialog).
</PRE>
<P><LI>Choose the OK button (You should then see Microsoft TCP/IP-32
<P><PRE>    3.11b in the Network Drivers dialog box).
</PRE>
<P><LI>Choose the Setup button and configure TCP/IP-32 3.11b based on
<P><PRE>    the information you wrote down in step 4.
</PRE>
<P><LI>If you added Microsoft NetBEUI as a network protocol in step 6 and
<P><PRE>    do not want to keep it, select Microsoft NetBEUI, choose the Remove
    button and then the Yes button to confirm.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Choose the Close button to exit the Network Divers dialog box.

<P><LI>Choose the OK button to exit the Network Setup dialog box (Setup
<P><PRE>    will modify system files).
</PRE>
<P><LI>Choose the OK button (Network Setup prompts you to reboot).

<P><LI>Choose the Restart Computer button (The TCP/IP-32 3.11b upgrade is
<P><PRE>    now complete).
</PRE><P>
</OL>Manual Installation for Advanced Users:

<OL><P><LI>Copy the following files to the C:\&lt;win_root&gt; directory:
<P>
   NOTE: By default, the Windows root directory referred to above is
   C:\WINDOWS. If you installed Windows into a directory other than
   C:\WINDOWS, copy these files to that directory.

<P><h3>2.2  Description of Bugs Fixed in TCP/IP-32 3.11b</h3>
 
<P>
TCP/IP-32 version 3.11 Does Not Include Terminal Font:
<P>
<PRE>   Beta versions of Microsoft TCP/IP-32 included a font named "Terminal"
   in the Telnet application. This font is not included in the released
   version of the TCP/IP-32 Telnet application.

</PRE>DNS Reverse Name Resolution Requests Are Incorrect:
<P>
<PRE>   TCP/IP-32 does not return the correct IP name when it queries the
   Domain Name Service (DNS) because it sends an improperly formatted
   query to the DNS.

</PRE>NBT Query Can Hang Computer or Drop Back To MS-DOS:
<P>
<PRE>   Your computer running Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 with
   TCP/IP-32 network protocol stops responding (hangs) or drops back to
   MS-DOS when the 32-bit NetBIOS over TCP/IP (NBT) makes a query to the
   Domain Name Service (DNS).

</PRE>LMHOSTS Lookup Can Cause Intermittent System Pauses:
<P>
<PRE>   Your computer running Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 with
   TCP/IP-32 intermittently stops responding (hangs) for about 20 seconds
   at a time. This occurs if TCP/IP-32 is installed as a non-default
   network protocol and the Enable LMHOSTS Lookup option in Network Setup
   is checked.

</PRE>TCP/IP-32 Winsock Stops FD_READ Notification:
<P>
<PRE>   FD_READ notification in a Winsock application may stop while the
   application is running.  This may cause data to be left in the input
   buffer, or, it may cause the application to hang. This occurs when the
   application disables and then re-enables FD_READ notification during a
   period of time while the Windows message queue is full.

</PRE>Winsock: Accept() Sockets Are Unexpectedly Aborted:
<P>
<PRE>   Occasionally, when you execute a PUT command from an FTP client, your
   session to the FTP server is aborted.

</PRE>Winsock calls return WSAEINPROGRESS
<P>
<PRE>   Windows Sockets applications running on Microsoft TCP/IP-32 may
   receive error 10036 (WSAEINPROGRESS). This problem occurs when
   applications process a large number of Windows Sockets calls.

</PRE>ARP Cache Commands May Not Work Correctly
<P>
<PRE>   ARP -S commands may not function correctly under Microsoft TCP/IP-32
   when the arp cache is empty.

</PRE>IPCONFIG Shows Leftover DHCP Parameters On Non-DHCP Clients
<P>
<PRE>   If TCP/IP-32 client is configured to use DHCP and then is re-configured
   to not use DHCP, when the command "IPCONFIG /ALL" is executed, it
   will show old (DHCP supplied) values for certain parameters.

</PRE>Domain Name Ignored by Windows for Workgroups with TCP/IP-32
<P>
<PRE>   When a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol(DHCP) client running
   TCP/IP-32 version 3.11 requests an IP address from a DHCP server,
   the IP address is received but the domain name is not recognized by
   the Windows for Workgroups client computer.
