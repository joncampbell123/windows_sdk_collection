The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5 and 3.51
<LI>Microsoft MS-DOS Networking Client 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In certain situations it may be necessary for a computer running MS-DOS
Networking Client 3.0 that is connecting to a Windows NT Server Domain to
be able to provide all user identification and password without the user
being present to enter this information at the system. This can be
accomplished by using a command line utility, several switches and a text
file passed to the utility.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The command line utility in the MS-DOS Networking Client 3.0 is the NET
LOGON command. In certain situations where power to an MS-DOS client is
terminated ungracefully, it may be desirable to configure the MS-DOS client
to automatically reconnect to the Windows NT domain with no user
interaction or where a user may be unavailable to interact with the system.
<P>
WARNING: The following set of procedures allows the MS-DOS client to
basically bypass normal Windows NT Domain USERID/PASSWORD security. User
IDs and passwords for this client are maintained in plain-text format and
are accessible to anyone who has direct access to the MS-DOS client.
Therefore, it may be necessary, depending upon your situation, to restrict
this particular user's access to the domain and its resources by
implementing strict share level controls, group controls, and/or limit this
user's logon to the Medium Access Control (MAC) address defined on the MS-
DOS client's network interface board.
<P>
<P><h3>Configuring an MS-DOS Networking Client to Log On to Domain Automatically</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>On a Windows NT Domain Controller Server in User Manager create a user
   account to be used by the MS-DOS client. Provide password, group
   membership, home directory, logon times, logon script, logon location
   and other account information as deemed necessary.

<P><LI>Setup your MS-DOS 3.0 Networking Client system to automatically logon to
   your domain. This is done, if you used defaults values, by running
   SETUP.EXE from the C:\NET subdirectory on your client's hard drive. This
   setup program can be set to automatically run the network client at
   startup. It does this by adding NET commands to the AUTOEXEC.BAT file or
   by allowing you to use the NET commands in another batch file that can
   be called at startup (or when executed by a user). We will be editing
   this batch file in the next step.

<P><LI>At the MS-DOS client, run your text editor and remark out (REM) the NET
   START command.
<P>
   For example, this NETSTART.BAT is the batch file used on a client with
   the TCP/IP protocol:
<P>
<P><PRE>      C:\NET\net initialize
      C:\NET\netbind.com
      C:\NET\umb.com
      C:\NET\tcptsr.exe
      C:\NET\tinyrfc.exe
      C:\NET\nmtsr.exe
      C:\NET\emsbfr.exe
      rem C:\NET\net start
</PRE><P>
   This keeps the network redirector from starting and allows us to start
   it with the options that are entered in the next line you see here:
<P>
<P><PRE>      C:\NET\net logon {userid} {localpassword} /domain:{ntdomainname} /yes
<PRE></PRE>         /savepw:no &lt; C:\NET\password.txt

   NOTE: Make sure that you do NOT enter a hard return at the end of this
   line. Let the line wrap as you type it and then finish it with a hard
   return. The finished batch file looks like this:

      C:\NET\net initialize
      C:\NET\netbind.com
      C:\NET\umb.com
      C:\NET\tcptsr.exe
      C:\NET\tinyrfc.exe
      C:\NET\nmtsr.exe
      C:\NET\emsbfr.exe
      rem C:\NET\net start
      C:\NET\net logon {userid} {localpassword} /domain:{ntdomainname} /yes
      /savepw:no &lt; C:\NET\password.txt

</PRE><P><LI>Save your batch file and create a new text file with the user account's
   password on the first line (the password is case sensitive) followed by
   a hard return. Save the file in the C:\NET subdirectory with the name
   PASSWORD.TXT.

<P><LI>Try running the batch file. If it does not work make sure that the the
   user and domain information are correct, then check to make sure that
   the MS-DOS client is initializing the network board and loading the
   protocols properly.
