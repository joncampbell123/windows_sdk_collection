Here are some basic protocol requirements within the Microsoft
network architecture:

<UL><LI>Each protocol layer offers one or more services to the functional
   layer above it. For instance, the NetBEUI logical link control (LLC)
   layer offers reliable connection oriented message services, as well
   as connectionless datagram data transfer services.

<LI>Each protocol operates within a well-defined environment, with
   several specific terms and objects. As an example, consider the
   Microsoft redirector server message block (SMB) protocol with its
   process IDs (PIDs), tree IDs (TIDs), multiplex IDs (MIDs) and more.

<LI>Each protocol has its own vocabulary of commands and associated
   responses that it uses in performing its services. NetBEUI's
   transport layer, for example, uses an "add.name.query" command to
   determine if a given name is unique on the network.

<LI>Because each protocol layer needs to add its own header (and
   sometimes trailer) to the network-bound frame, they all have a
   structured format by which they build the frame that they will
   pass to the layer below.

<LI>For each command/response defined, there is an associated set of
   procedural rules. For example, when the NetBEUI transport protocol
   "add.name.query" command is issued, no response within a configurable
   time period indicates that the specified name is unique on the
   network, whereas an "add.name.response" response indicates that the
   name is not unique and therefore cannot be used.
