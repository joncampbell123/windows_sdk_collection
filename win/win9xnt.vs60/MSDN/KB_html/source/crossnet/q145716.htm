<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When using LPR to print to an Hewlett-Packard (HP) printer with an internal
or external JetDirect product, printing fails from some applications or
clients, but not others. An Event 2004 error is written to the System Log.
The JetDirect cards that exhibit this problem have firmware revision 03.15
through 04.08.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
If the LPR control or data file that is sent from Windows NT to the printer
is exactly 99 bytes the JetDirect card fails to correctly process the
remaining LPR packets. In Network Monitor the control or data file appears
as 100 bytes because of a line feed at the end of the control or data file.
The data file contains the actual print job. The control file typically
contains the following information:
<P>
<PRE>   Host Name
   User id
   Format control Character (l or f) and filename
   Unlink datafile and filename
   Job name for the banner page

</PRE>Additional control fields can be contained in the control file. For more
information about control file contents please see Section 7 of Request for
Comment (RFC) 1179.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
According to Hewlett Packard, firmware revision 04.09 fixes this problem.
Contact Hewlett Packard about the availability of this update. It is also
available from the HP web site www.hp.com.
<P>
To determine if the control file is the problem, have the user log in
with a shorter user name. If they can now print, they are experiencing
this problem. If the problem is with the data file, changing the name does
not make a difference and you may have to get a network trace to determine
the problem.
<P>
The JetDirect card is manufactured by Hewlett Packard, a vendor independent
of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this
product's performance or reliability.
