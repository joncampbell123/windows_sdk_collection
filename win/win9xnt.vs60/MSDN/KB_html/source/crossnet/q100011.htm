The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1 and 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
There are several issues that need to be addressed in order to ensure
smooth interoperability between Windows NT and Windows for Workgroups.
When setting up your network, note the following three issues:
<P>
<P><h3>Browsemaster Conflicts</h3>
 
<P>
Browsemaster contentions can occur between Windows for Workgroups
workstations and Windows NT workstations when a workgroup or domain
contains at least one machine of each type. You may have difficulty
seeing servers in a Windows NT network from a Windows for Workgroups
workstation if the workstation is a backup browsemaster and not
registered in the Windows NT network. To work around this problem, do the
following:

<UL><LI>Make sure there is a guest account enabled in the Windows NT domain.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Add the following line to the [network] section of the SYSTEM.INI files
   in all Windows for Workgroups machines on the network:
<P>
<P><PRE>      MaintainServerList=no
</PRE><P>
   This workaround stops all Windows for Workgroups workstations from
   trying to be browsemasters. If you use this workaround, you need to
   ensure that at least one Windows NT machine (workstation or server) in
   the workgroup or domain is running at all times. Until a Windows NT
   machine is running or a user changes the value of the MaintainServerList
   variable to "auto" and reboots, no browsing can occur (you receive error
   6118).
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Log on to the domain or workgroup with a valid account (even a guest
   account works).
<P>
</UL><h3>Guest Accounts</h3>
 
<P>
Guest accounts should remain enabled on domain controllers. Instead of
removing guest accounts to restrict access to certain services, simply
remove any of the undesired or all of the guest account rights in User
Manager.
<P>
<P><h3>User Name Duplication</h3>
 
<P>
There should not be user name duplicates on different domains. If a
user name is duplicated across different domains, there will be
inconsistent results when a logon is attempted from a Windows for
Workgroups workstation on that Windows NT network.
