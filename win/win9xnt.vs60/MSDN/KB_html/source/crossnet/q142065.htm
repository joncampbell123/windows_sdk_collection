The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If you do not have network adapters, you can use a null-modem (serial)
cable to connect a Windows 95 computer to a Windows NT computer. There are
two ways to configure this connection:

<UL><LI>Windows NT is the host and Windows 95 is the guest
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Windows 95 is the host and Windows NT is the guest
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Windows NT is the Host and Windows 95 is the Guest</h3>
 
<P>
If you use Windows NT as the server, start the RAS Server Service on the
Windows NT computer and make sure the user who is connecting has RAS Dial-
in permissions. The Windows 95 guest should connect using the Direct Cable
Connect utility and should have their serial adapter configured for the
same speed connection as the Windows NT computer.
<P>
<P><h3>Windows 95 is the Host and Windows NT is the Guest</h3>
 
<P>
If you use a Windows 95 computer as the server, configure the Windows NT
computer with a Phonebook entry that uses the null modem 19200 speed (or
whatever speed is set on the Windows 95 computer) and dial the Windows 95
computer.
<P>
<P><h3>Notes</h3>
 
<P>
Windows NT 4.0:
<P>
The serial cable device is installed/configured in the Modem utility in
Control Panel and is listed under Standard Modem Types as "Dial-Up
Networking Serial Cable between 2 PCs."
<P>
Windows NT 3.5x:
<P>
The serial cable device is installed/configured in the Remote Access Setup
and is listed as Null Modem 9600, Null Modem 19200, or Null Modem 38400.
<P>
Windows 95:
<P>
The serial cable device is configured in the System utility in Control
Panel. Click the Device Manager tab, double-click Modems, and then double-
click Serial Cable On ComX (where 'x' is the COM port where your cable is
attached.) Make sure the speed set here matches the speed of the Windows
NT serial connection. The client (guest) and server (host) must be the
same
for the serial connection to work properly.
<P>
For additional information on null-modem (serial) cables, such as the
proper pin-out configuration to work with the setups above, please see
