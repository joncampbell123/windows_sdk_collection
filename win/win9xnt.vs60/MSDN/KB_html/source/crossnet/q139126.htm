<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
It is possible to access remote NetWare resources from a Windows for
Workgroups 3.11, Windows NT 3.5x, or Windows 95 Remote Access (RAS) client.
This article discusses the requirements for accessing remote NetWare
resources for each of these RAS clients. This article assumes the use of a
Windows NT 3.5x Server as the RAS server.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Windows for Workgroups 3.11 Client</h3>
 
<P>
The Windows for Workgroups 3.11 RAS client only supports the NetBEUI
protocol. Therefore, the RAS server must act as a gateway to the NetWare
resources.
<P>
On the RAS server, or any other Windows NT Server on the same network as
your RAS server, you must perform the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Install the NWLink IPX/SPX Compatible protocol.

<P><LI>Install Gateway Services for NetWare (GSNW). GSNW is only available on
   Windows NT Server.

<P><LI>Use the GSNW icon in Control Panel to configure one or more Gateways to
   NetWare resources on your LAN. By configuring a Gateway to these NetWare
   resources, you are allowing access to NetWare resources from clients
   that are unable to connect directly to your NetWare servers but are able
   to connect to your Windows NT server.
<P>
   On the Windows for Workgroups 3.11 RAS client, connect to the NetWare
   resources by specifying the server name of the Windows NT Server running
   GSNW and the share name defined for the NetWare resources. Choose the
   Windows NT Server and share from the browse list or use the following
   format to connect directly to the share using the Path field of File
   Manager's Connect Network Drive dialog:
<P>
<P><PRE>      \\&lt;Server_Name&gt;\&lt;Share_Name&gt;
</PRE><P>
</OL><h3>Windows NT 3.5x RAS Client</h3>
 
<P>
Windows NT 3.5x RAS supports the IPX protocol over a RAS connection,
eliminating the need to use a Gateway to access NetWare resources from the
RAS client. The user account you use on your RAS client computer must have
proper access permission to resources you connect to on the NetWare
servers.
<P>
On the RAS server, you must perform the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Install the NWLink IPX/SPX Compatible protocol.

<P><LI>Configure the RAS Server to allow remote clients running IPX. To enable
   this option, use the Network Control Panel applet and configure the
   Remote Access Service. Choose the Network button and select IPX in the
   Server Settings section. NetBEUI and TCP/IP can be enabled or disabled.

<P><LI>Choose the Configure button to the right of the IPX Checkbox. Make sure
   IPX clients have access to the entire network by selecting the Entire
   Network radio button.
<P>
</OL>On the Windows NT RAS client, you must perform the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Install the NWLink IPX/SPX Compatible protocol.

<P><LI>Install Client Services for NetWare (CSNW).

<P><LI>Edit your Remote Access PhoneBook entry for your RAS server and enable
   the IPX protocol. To enable the IPX protocol, select the Network button
   and select the IPX checkbox. You must use PPP as SLIP does not support
   the IPX protocol.

<P><LI>Once you are connected to the RAS server, connect to NetWare resources
   on the remote network using File Manager or the NET USE command. If you
   connect directly to the NetWare server instead of selecting the server
   and share from the browse list, the server name you enter should be the
   server name of the NetWare server and the share name should be the name
   of the volume on the NetWare server.
<P>
</OL><h3>Windows 95 Dial-Up Networking Client</h3>
 
<P>
Windows 95 Dial-Up Networking also supports IPX over the RAS connection.
The user account you use on your Dial-Up Networking client computer must
have proper access permission to resources you connect to on the NetWare
servers.
<P>
On the RAS server, you must perform the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Install the NWLink IPX/SPX Compatible protocol.

<P><LI>Configure the RAS Server to allow remote clients running IPX. To enable
   this option, use the Network Control Panel applet and configure the
   Remote Access Service. Choose the Network button and select IPX in the
   Server Settings section. NetBEUI and TCP/IP can be enabled or disabled.

<P><LI>Choose the Configure button to the right of the IPX Checkbox. Make sure
   IPX clients have access to the entire network by selecting the Entire
   Network radio button.
<P>
</OL>On the Windows 95 Dial-Up Networking client, you must perform the following
steps:

<OL><P><LI>Install the IPX/SPX Compatible protocol.

<P><LI>Install the Microsoft Client for NetWare networks.

<P><LI>Edit the properties of your Dial-Up Networking icon for your RAS server
   and enable the IPX protocol. To enable the IPX protocol, choose the
   Server Type button and enable the IPX/SPX Compatible checkbox in the
   Allowed Network protocols section.

<P><LI>Once you are connected to the RAS server, use the Network Neighborhood
   application to connect to resources on remote NetWare servers.
<P>
<P>
</OL>NOTE: If you use Windows NT RAS and you are running CSNW or Windows 95
Dial-Up Networking and you are running the Microsoft Client for NetWare
networks and you connect with IPX to a remote, you will lose connectivity
to all local NetWare servers. You will only have NetWare connectivity to
the remote network. You cannot browse or reconnect to local NetWare servers
as long as the RAS or Dial-Up Networking connection exists.
