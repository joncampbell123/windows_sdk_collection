The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5 and 3.51
<LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Browsing from a Windows 95 client that is part of a Windows NT Domain
with Network Neighborhood shows an empty window.
<P>
-or-
<P>
Double-clicking Entire Network gives an the error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Unable to browse the network.
   The network is not accessible.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Windows 95 client is configured both to logon to an NT Domain and
is also configured as a Workgroup machine. Meaning that the Workgroup value
and the NT Domain value's do not match.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Either have the Windows 95 client exist as part of a workgroup or as part
of the Windows NT domain. Do this from the Network icon in Control Panel.
<P>
Unlike Windows NT or Windows for Workgroups, Windows 95 identifies
the Workgroup and Domain settings in two different places in the Network
section of Control Panel.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If you log onto an Windows NT Domain from your Windows 95 computer and
browse the Network Neighborhood, you only see Workgroup machines. These are
individual computers that are not part of the Windows NT Domain (they may
or may not have resources to share).
<P>
If you want to view domain resources, double click the Entire Network icon.
This list may appear instantly or may take several minutes to assemble
depending upon the size and complexity of the network.
<P>
To Enable Windows NT Domain validation for proper browsing of the domain's
resources:

<OL><P><LI>To allow Windows 95 users to logon to a Windows NT Domain, click the
   Properties button in the Configuration tab of the Client for Microsoft
   Networks. In the same Properties dialog select the check box to enable
   Windows NT Domain validation and specify the name of the domain.

<P><LI>In the same Properties dialog, you can select the Quick Logon option
   from the Network Logon Options. This validates your logon, but does not
   reestablish previously redirected network drives. I does show ghosted
   network drives which are reconnected when you use that drive.
<P>
   Alternatively, you can select the Logon and Restore Network Connections
   option from the Network Logon Options. This validates your logon and
   reestablishes previously redirected network drives. This can take some
   time to reconnect all drives.

<P><LI>To browse Windows NT domain resources, enter the name of the Windows NT
   domain in the Identification tab. Then click OK.
<P>
</OL>To enable your Windows 95 computer to be validated by the Windows NT Domain
in addition to being part of a Windows 95 workgroup, make configure Windows
95 to logon to a Windows NT Domain as described above. Then, enter the name
of the workgroup in the Workgroup field in the Identification tab.
