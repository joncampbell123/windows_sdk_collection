The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51 and 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51 and 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Network Client version 3.0 for MS-DOS
<LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11
<LI>Microsoft LAN Manager version 2.2c
<LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you browse a Window NT computer using the NET VIEW command from a
Windows 95 or a Windows for Workgroups computer, the following error
message appears:
<P>
<PRE>   Error 234: Additional data is available.

</PRE>On a LAN Manager 2.2c (MS-DOS) client computer, the following error
message
appears:
<P>
<PRE>   NET3513: More data is available than can be returned by LAN Manager.

</PRE>When you browse a Windows NT computer using File Manager in Windows for
Workgroups, the following error message appears:
<P>
<PRE>   An internal LAN Manager error occurred.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
These errors can occur if a share name of the Windows NT computer is
greater than 12 characters and/or contains a space.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Make sure that all the share names on the Windows NT computer are 12
characters or less and do not contain any spaces.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To ensure that the problems above do not occur, Windows NT File Manager,
Server Manager and the NET SHARE command do not allow share names greater
than 12 characters. In addition, if the share name exceeds the 8.3
directory naming size, the following message appears when you attempt to
share the directory in Windows NT:
<P>
<PRE>   This sharename &lt;share name&gt; is not accessible from some MS-DOS
   workstations. Are you sure you want to use this sharename?

</PRE>While the error does not mention Windows for Workgroups this could affect
those clients as well.
<P>
In Windows NT 4.xx, under the “Add Printer” wizard you will no longer
received any warnings about name length.  Also under Windows 4.0 Explorer
you will not receive any warnings.  Remember when browsing the browser
returns ALL share names so even ONE name will prevent the ENTIRE list from
being returned.  So, for example, a too long data share name will prevent
all printers from being browsed.
<P>
However, the Windows NT Resource Kit utility, RMTSHARE.EXE, allows you to
create a share name that exceeds 12 characters. When you share a directory
that exceeds the 8.3 directory naming size using Rmtshare, the message
above does not appear. Therefore, there is no warning that the share name
you create is not accessible from an MS-DOS networking client computer or
Windows for Workgroups.
<P>
If you use the NET USE command or Explorer in Windows 95, you are able to
successfully connect to the network share that exceeds 12 characters on
the Windows NT computer. If you use the NET USE command in Windows for
Workgroups, you are able to successfully connect to the same share.
However, you cannot connect to the same share using File Manager in
Windows for Workgroups. If you use the NET USE command from any of the
MS-DOS client computers, you cannot connect to the share.
<P>
The following is a sample Rmtshare command line syntax, which you can use
to create a share name that is greater than 12 characters:
<P>
<PRE>   rmtshare \\NT_Server\Thirteen_char=c:\MyDir
