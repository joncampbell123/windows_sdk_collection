</UL><h2>More Information</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Advance</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   With use of its new ADVANCE field format, Word 6.0 now successfully
   converts the majority of the cases where Advance codes are used in
   WordPerfect documents. WordPerfect up, down, to-line, left, and
   right Advance formats and horizontal/vertical combinations thereof
   are mapped to equivalent Word 6.0 ADVANCE \U, \D, \Y, \X, \L, and
   \Y formats, and vice versa.

   In contrast, Word 2.0c offers no equivalent functionality, and
   WordPerfect Advance codes are ignored during conversion.

</PRE><h3>Annotations</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   Word now exports annotations as WordPerfect comments, but also
   inserts a marker with the comment. This marker appears as a harmless
   [Unknown] code in WordPerfect Reveal Codes and enables, Word to
   subsequently reimport these comments as annotations instead of hidden
   text. Because WordPerfect comments cannot contain non-text structures
   such as tables, graphics, and so forth, these contents of a Word
   annotation are lost when saving as WordPerfect format.

   In contrast, in Word 2.0c, WordPerfect comments are imported as
   annotations, but Word annotations are exported as hidden text.
   This results in loss of annotations in round-trip conversion to
   and then back from WordPerfect format.

</PRE><h3>Block Protect</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   WordPerfect block protect is a character/line protection property.
   Word 6.0 now converts WordPerfect block protect to the closest
   equivalent paragraph protection using Keep With Next and Keep
   Lines Together paragraph formats, and vice versa.

   In contrast, Word 2.0c ignores WordPerfect Block Protect codes
   altogether.

</PRE><h3>Borders, Dashed and Dotted</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   Word 6.0 now supports dashed and dotted borders and converts
   WordPerfect dashed and dotted graphic box (frame) and table borders
   to these equivalents, and vice versa. Word paragraphs with dashed
   or dotted borders are converted to WordPerfect Text boxes with
   equivalent border settings.

   In contrast, Word 2.0c does not support either of these border
   types and converted WordPerfect dashed and dotted borders to single
   borders.

</PRE><h3>Captions</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   Word 6.0 now converts WordPerfect figure box captions to captions
   including SEQ (sequence) field entries that prepare resulting
   frames for cross-referencing. Caption positions: above inside,
   above outside, below inside, and below outside for the original
   figure box are retained.

   In contrast, although Word 2.0c retains caption text and
   positioning, it marks captions with TC fields that do not
   adequately prepare captions for cross-referencing.

</PRE><h3>Color</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   When you choose to save as WordPerfect 5.1 for MS-DOS, Word 6.0 now
   maps Word for Windows font colors to the standard color codes that
   WordPerfect 5.1 for MS-DOS understands (for example, [Color:Blue]).
   If you instead choose to save as WordPerfect 5.x for Windows
   format, font colors are mapped to specific RGB color codes (for
   example, [Color:0%,0%,100%]) that are understood by WordPerfect for
   Windows. This differentiation enables the most accurate round-trip
   conversion of color.

   In contrast, Word 2.0c maps all colors to standard color values,
   which negatively affects round-trip conversion.

</PRE><h3>Columns, Parallel</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   Word 6.0 in most cases now converts WordPerfect parallel columns
   with or without block protect into Word tables with rows that break
   across pages. If a parallel column layout itself contains a box
   (frame) or exists on a page containing a paragraph anchored box, it
   is instead converted to a newspaper column layout because Word
   tables cannot contain frames.

   In contrast, Word 2.0c converts all parallel column layouts into
   newspaper (snaking) columns. This often results in loss of variable
   column width, vertical offset of related items in each column, and
   potential distortion of layout if the original WordPerfect parallel
   column layout contains a single column that spanned more than one
   page.

</PRE><h3>Columns, Variable-Width</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   Because of its new support for variable-width columns, Word 6.0 now
   fully supports conversion of WordPerfect variable-width column
   layouts.

   In contrast, Word 2.0c converts WordPerfect variable-width columns
   to Word fixed-width columns, resulting in degradation of document
   layout.

</PRE><h3>Compatibility Options</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   Word 6.0 includes an interface to modify certain display behavior
   for certain layout and pagination properties in Word that are
   normally inconsistent with WordPerfect without affecting the manner
   in which a document is actually saved. When a document is converted
   from WordPerfect, several of these options are automatically
   triggered so that Word can make converted documents more closely
   retain their original appearance. Compatibility options used during
   WordPerfect conversion include:

    - Don't add automatic tab stop for hanging indent -- When a Word
      6.0 paragraph is formatted with a hanging indent, it normally
      acts as if there is an automatic tab stop set to the level of
      the indent. WordPerfect does not behave in this manner, so this
      behavior is deactivated when opening WordPerfect documents.

    - Don't balance columns for Continuous section -- Word
      automatically balances columns preceding a continuous section
      break. WordPerfect does not behave like this, so this feature is
      turned-off in Word when opening WordPerfect documents.

    - Wrap trailing spaces to next line -- This option configures Word
      to be consistent with WordPerfect in the way it treats trailing
      space characters at the end of a line. With this option active,
      spaces at the end of a line can be underlined and can be used to
      insert space to the right of a right-aligned paragraph or
      right-aligned tab-stop position.

</PRE><h3>Conditional End-of-Page</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   WordPerfect conditional end-of-page is a line protection property.
   Word 6.0 now converts WordPerfect conditional end-of-page settings
   to keep with next paragraph format.

   In contrast, Word 2.0c ignores WordPerfect conditional end-of-page
   codes altogether.

</PRE><h3>Cross Reference Targets (Bookmarks)</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   Word 6.0 now converts WordPerfect cross-reference targets to
   bookmarks and vice versa.

   In contrast, Word 2.0c ignores WordPerfect target codes altogether.

</PRE><h3>Cross References</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   Word 6.0 now converts WordPerfect footnote and endnote number,
   page, and box (figure, text, user, and equation) cross-references
   to equivalent cross-reference fields, and vice versa. Only the
   textual result of WordPerfect paragraph and outline cross-
   references are retained because there are not equivalent cross-
   reference fields for these types of references in Word.

   In contrast, Word 2.0c ignores WordPerfect cross-references
   altogether.

</PRE><h3>DDE Links</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   Word 6.0 fully supports the conversion of documents containing
   dynamic data exchange (DDE) links to and from WordPerfect for
   Windows. To facilitate proper export of DDE links, the converter
   provides separate options to convert to WordPerfect 5.0,
   WordPerfect 5.1 for MS-DOS, and WordPerfect 5.x for Windows
   formats. Selecting WordPerfect 5.x for Windows format will ensure
   that DDE links are retained.

   In contrast, Word 2.0c does not differentiate between WordPerfect
   for MS-DOS and WordPerfect for Windows file formats. As a result,
   DDE is not supported in conversion.

</PRE><h3>Equations</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   Word 6.0 now converts WordPerfect equations directly into Microsoft
   Equation Editor 2.0 format, and vice versa. Word 6.0 equations (OLE
   2.0 objects) are retained as WordPerfect equations (not as OLE 1.0
   objects) when converting to WordPerfect 5.x for Windows format.

   In contrast, Word 2.0c only supports the import of WordPerfect
   equations, and these are converted into Word EQ fields, which are
   less convenient to edit than Equation Editor objects.

</PRE><h3>Font Substitution</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   Word 6.0 has significantly expanded its ability to map to the
   proper font or closest available alternative when converting to or
   from WordPerfect. When opening WordPerfect documents, Word
   accomplishes this with the following steps:

   1. Word detects font names while reading a WordPerfect document and
      checks for an exact font name match under Windows.

   2. If an exact name match is not available, Word examines the
      metrics of the original WordPerfect font, queries the Windows
      system to determine what fonts are available for the
      current (default) printer, and then makes the best match
      possible from the list of available fonts.

   Once a WordPerfect document has been opened in Word, the original
   WordPerfect font name is displayed on the formatting toolbar, and
   the substituted Windows font is applied for display and printing.

   For those instances where this is a more desirable mapping, Word
   also provides a friendly interface to allow you to easily map
   missing WordPerfect documents fonts into fonts of your choice that
   are available on your system. You can choose to perform a permanent
   font conversion or to just choose a new temporary mapping, leaving
   the original WordPerfect font information intact in the Word file.

   In addition, Word supports a significantly enhanced number of
   possible target fonts when saving as WordPerfect. You can also
   customize export font-mapping through use of our expanded font-
   mapping file functionality.

   For more information on import font substitution and use of a
   custom export font-mapping file, double-click the Help button on
   the Standard toolbar in Word, and then type "readme” (without
   quotation marks). Press ENTER twice, choose the File Conversion
   topic, and then choose the Substituting Fonts When Converting
   Documents topic.

   In contrast, Word 2.0c does not query the system to determine
   whether a font is actually available, often resulting in
   substitution of fonts not actually available on the system. Export
   font mapping is also more limited.

</PRE><h3>Footnotes and Endnotes</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   Because of its new ability to include both footnotes and endnotes
   in the same document, Word 6.0 now fully supports conversion of
   WordPerfect footnotes and endnotes.

   In contrast, Word 2.0c can include footnotes or endnotes in a
   document, but not both. As a result, when reading WordPerfect
   documents that contain both footnotes and endnotes, Word 2.0c
   retains footnotes but converts endnotes as normal text.

</PRE><h3>Frame and Graphic Positioning</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   Because of its new two-pass WordPerfect conversion architecture
   (see Two-Pass Conversion Architecture below) and drawing layer,
   Word 6.0 now maintains frame and graphic positioning much more
   effectively during conversion.

   In contrast, Word 2.0c has significantly more difficulty in
   appropriately positioning frames and graphics.

</PRE><h3>Full Justification</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   Word 6.0 now adjusts character spacing when converting WordPerfect
   paragraphs formatted as fully justified in order to best reconcile
   the model differences in the spacing of justified text in the two
   products. Word accomplishes this by condensing character spacing by
   3 twips (3/1440ths of an inch) per 12 points of font size when
   converting fully justified WordPerfect paragraphs to justified
   paragraphs in Word.

   If you do not want Word to condense character spacing in fully
   justified paragraphs when opening WordPerfect documents, you have
   the option of modifying how the converter functions. For more
   information on how to set the MSTXTCNV.INI FavourAppearance flag to
   not allow condensed spacing for fully justified paragraphs, double-
   click the Help button on the Standard toolbar in Word, and then
   type "readme" (without the quotation marks). Press ENTER twice,
   choose the File Conversion topic, and choose the Modifying
   Conversion Options topic.

</PRE><h3>Graphic on Disk</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   Word 6.0 converts WordPerfect Figure boxes containing a link to a
   source graphic on disk by dynamically calling the WPG Graphic
   import filter to process the graphic file. If the graphic file is
   not available in the location specified in the WordPerfect Figure
   Box, Word 6.0 prompts you with the option to specify the location
   of the graphic, ignore the graphic and continue conversion, or
   cancel conversion. If you choose to ignore the graphic, an IMPORT
   field is created and a frame placeholder appears in the converted
   document.

   In contrast, Word 2.0c does not provide the option of specifying
   the location of a missing graphic on disk.

</PRE><h3>Hyphenation Zone</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   Word 6.0 now converts WordPerfect's Left Hyphenation Zone
   percentage to an appropriate Hyphenation Zone measure, and vice
   versa.

   In contrast, Word 2.0c ignores WordPerfect hyphenation zone
   settings.

</PRE><h3>Kerning, Automatic and Manual</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   Because of its new support for automatic kerning of fonts, Word 6.0
   now successfully converts WordPerfect automatic kerning. The Points
   and Above measure in Word is set to the current font size active at
   the location at which kerning was applied in the original
   WordPerfect document.

   WordPerfect Manual Kerning is actually applied within WordPerfect
   documents as Advance formatting and is converted as such. See the
   discussion of Advance format above for more information.

   In contrast, Word 2.0c does not support kerning or Advance formats
   and, therefore, ignored WordPerfect automatic and manual kerning.

</PRE><h3>Keyboard Input Fields</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   Word 6.0 now converts WordPerfect INPUT, PROMPT/KEYBOARD, and
   STATUSPROMPT/KEYBOARD merge field combination into FILLIN fields in
   Word. Word FILLIN fields are not preserved in conversion to
   WordPerfect.

   In contrast, Word 2.0c ignores these WordPerfect merge commands
   altogether.

</PRE><h3>Language Codes</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   Word 6.0 now converts all WordPerfect Language codes that have
   equivalents in Word to these equivalents, and vice versa.

   In contrast, Word 2.0c ignores WordPerfect language codes
   altogether.

</PRE><h3>Layered Drawing</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   In WordPerfect, the Wrap Around = No setting causes text that would
   otherwise follow the frame to overlap the frame instead.

   Because of its new drawing layer, Word 6.0 now fully supports the
   conversion of WordPerfect boxes for which the Wrap Around option
   has been set to "No" by converting such boxes to drawing objects.
   These drawing objects can be placed above or below document text
   with no ensuing wrapping.

   In contrast, Word 2.0c's Wrap Around option, regardless of Yes or
   No setting, is not equivalent to this WordPerfect format. The
   result is that text intended to overlap a box in WordPerfect
   instead appears beneath (following) the resulting frame in Word.

</PRE><h3>Line Numbering</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   Word 6.0 now converts WordPerfect line numbering within constraints
   imposed by model differences in the two products. These
   limitations include:

    - Word 6.0 does not support an option not to number blank lines,
      and therefore if WordPerfect's option to do so is activated,
      blank lines will still be numbered when opening a WordPerfect
      document into Word.

    - In WordPerfect, if you choose to restart line numbering on each
      page, the line number always restarts as 1, regardless of the
      starting line number specified. In Word 6.0, line numbering
      restarts at the top of the page beginning with the starting line
      number.

    - Line numbering is a section property in Word 6.0, and a line
      property in WordPerfect. Therefore, starting points for changes
      in line numbering may be delayed when opening a WordPerfect
      document into Word.

   In contrast, Word 2.0c ignores WordPerfect line numbering
   altogether.

</PRE>Master Documents/Subdocument Links
 
<P>
<PRE>   Word 6.0 converts WordPerfect subdocument links to equivalent
   INCLUDETEXT fields and vice versa. Word 6.0 also prompts for
   missing subdocuments at the time of conversion. If a subdocument is
   missing, you can either cancel conversion or open the document
   without the subdocument links.

   In contrast, Word 2.0c converts subdocument links to and from
   INCLUDE fields, but does not dynamically check for the existence of
   supporting subdocuments.

</PRE><h3>OLE Objects</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   Word 6.0 fully supports the conversion of documents containing
   object linking and embedding (OLE) objects to and from WordPerfect
   5.2 for Windows. To facilitate proper export of OLE links, the
   converter provides separate options to convert to WordPerfect 5.0,
   WordPerfect 5.1 for MS-DOS, and WordPerfect 5.x for Windows
   formats. Selecting WordPerfect 5.x for Windows ensures that OLE
   objects (with the exception of Equation Editor 2.0 objects ) remain
   as objects and retain all the necessary binary data, while choosing
   WordPerfect 5.0 or WordPerfect 5.1 for MS-DOS converts OLE
   objects to pictures that can be understood by these versions of
   WordPerfect for MS-DOS.

   In contrast, Word 2.0c does not differentiate between WordPerfect
   for MS-DOS and WordPerfect for Windows file formats. As a result,
   OLE objects are not supported in conversion.

</PRE><h3>Paragraph Numbering</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   Paragraph numbering in Word is a function that does not depend upon
   placement of explicit formatting codes within a document. Word 6.0
   now converts WordPerfect paragraph numbering into appropriately
   numbered paragraphs while retaining information that allows the
   restoration of paragraph numbering codes if you subsequently save
   the document back into WordPerfect format.

   In contrast, Word 2.0 converts WordPerfect paragraph numbering to
   literal text, resulting in loss of edibility if you choose to
   convert the document back into WordPerfect format.

</PRE><h3>PRIVATE Fields</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   For greater fidelity in conversion of documents between Word and
   WordPerfect, Word 6.0 now includes a PRIVATE field. The converter
   uses this field to store special binary information about how a
   WordPerfect document was constructed before it was converted to
   Word. This enables Word to later use this information to more
   accurately reconstruct formatting features that would otherwise
   change or be lost in conversion back to WordPerfect.

   The PRIVATE field is used in over 12 scenarios by the Word 6.0
   WordPerfect converter. Some examples of format features that
   depend on this technology for accurate round-trip conversion from
   and back to WordPerfect include Tables of Contents and Figure
   Boxes.

   In addition, Word embeds codes in the same manner in harmless
   locations in exported WordPerfect documents to enable optimal
   round-trip conversion to and back from WordPerfect format. These
   codes appear as [Unknown] codes in WordPerfect Reveal Codes.

   In contrast, accurate round-trip of many such elements is not
   possible in Word 2.0c and earlier.

</PRE><h3>Round-Trip Frame Reassembly</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   Word 6.0 significantly improves coexistence with WordPerfect
   through round-trip disassembly of framed objects. This is necessary
   because Word allows mixed text and graphics to appear within
   frames, but WordPerfect does not allow similar functionality in its
   boxes. On export from Word, frames are now converted to text boxes
   with separate figure boxes for each graphic. When opening the same
   document back into Word, such collections of boxes are reassembled
   into the original mixed text-and-graphics frame.

   In contrast, Word 2.0c degrades this formatting during round-trip
   conversion of such files.

</PRE><h3>Retain Graphic Background Option</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   WordPerfect treats all WPG graphic images having white backgrounds
   as if they have transparent backgrounds when placed inside
   transparent figure boxes (boxes without background shading
   defined). To accommodate this behavior, Word 6.0 by default removes
   background color when importing WordPerfect documents.

   If you do not want Word to remove backgrounds from graphics when
   opening WordPerfect documents, you can modify how the converter
   processes these graphics.

   For more information on how to set the MSTXTCNV.INI
   RetainBackground flag to retain backgrounds for WPG images, double-
   click the Help button on the Standard toolbar in Word, and then
   type "readme" (without the quotation marks). Press ENTER twice,
   choose the File Conversion topic, and choose the Modifying
   Conversion Options topic.

</PRE><h3>Secondary Merge Files (Data Documents)</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   Word 6.0 now automatically detects and converts WordPerfect
   secondary merge files to data source document format. Secondary
   files containing 32 fields or less become tables, and those with
   greater than 32 fields become tab-delimited. WordPerfect
   conditional print merge constructs and macros are not retained.

   If you choose to save Word data source document in tab or comma
   delimited or table format as a "WordPerfect 5.0 Secondary File” or
   "WordPerfect 5.1 or 5.2 Secondary File”, the document is converted
   to a secondary merge file delimited with the appropriate merge
   commands for that version of WordPerfect. Conditional print merge
   constructs are not retained.

   In contrast, Word 2.0c ignored all WordPerfect merge commands and
   converted contents of secondary merge files as literal text.

</PRE><h3>Styles</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   Styles are now retained in conversion to and from WordPerfect. Word
   6.0 converts WordPerfect open, paired, and outline styles
   containing paragraph formatting to Paragraph styles. WordPerfect
   styles that contain only character formatting become Word 6.0
   Character styles. Text or nonparagraph or character-level
   formatting properties contained in WordPerfect styles (for example,
   table definitions) are converted as text or direct formatting.

   In contrast, Word 2.0c ignores style definitions and converts all
   styled text with direct formatting.

</PRE><h3>Suppress</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   Word 6.0 now honors WordPerfect header, footer, and header/footer
   page number suppression codes. Word accomplishes this through use
   of the different odd and even and different first page header and
   footer formats and/or section breaks.

   In contrast, Word 2.x ignores WordPerfect suppress codes, often
   resulting in display of headers, footers, and/or page numbers on
   pages on which they were not intended to appear.

</PRE><h3>Table and Frame Interaction</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   Word 6.0 doesn't allow tables to contain frames or nested tables.
   Therefore, conversion of WordPerfect tables constructed in this
   manner can be extremely difficult. Through the use of its new
   two-pass WordPerfect converter architecture (see "Two-Pass
   Conversion Architecture" below), Word 6.0 is now able to deal much
   more effectively with interactions between WordPerfect tables and
   boxes.

   In contrast, Word 2.0c frequently experiences difficulty converting
   documents constructed in this manner.

</PRE><h3>Table Headers</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   Because of its new ability to define one or more table header rows,
   Word 6.0 now successfully converts table header rows to and from
   WordPerfect.

   In contrast, Word 2.0c converts tables, but WordPerfect header
   rows are retained only on the first page of the table.

</PRE><h3>Table Row Heights</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   Word 6.0 accurately maps WordPerfect table row top and bottom cell
   margins to equivalent space before and space after paragraph margin
   settings. This improvement has a significant positive effect on
   maintaining as closely as possible the original length and
   pagination of table-intensive documents.

   In contrast, Word 2.0c ignores WordPerfect table border margins,
   resulting in Word tables that are significantly shorter than their
   WordPerfect counterparts.

</PRE><h3>Tables of Authorities/Short and Long Citations</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   Because of its new support for tables of authorities, Word 6.0 now
   successfully converts WordPerfect short and long-form table of
   authority entries and tables of authorities. Word accomplishes this
   by converting WordPerfect short and long form entries to TC \s and
   TC \l fields, and by converting generated or non-generated
   (compiled) Tables of Authorities to TOA fields, and vice versa.

   In contrast, Word 2.0c does not support tables of authorities and
   converts WordPerfect tables of authorities as normal text.

</PRE><h3>Text-Based Linedraw</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   Word 6.0 is now much more effective at converting documents
   containing WordPerfect text-based line drawing characters. It
   accomplishes this by using the TrueType MS Linedraw font to
   appropriately express these characters.

   In contrast, the font used for this same purpose by Word 2.x is
   not scaleable, often resulting in display degradation at point
   sizes smaller or larger than 12 point.

</PRE><h3>Two-Pass Conversion Architecture</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   There are certain WordPerfect features that are extremely difficult
   or impossible to convert reliably because to convert these
   features, our converter requires information that is stored further
   "downstream" in the document data stream, but our converter only
   makes one sequential pass through a WordPerfect document in Word
   2.0c.

   To address this problem in Word 6.0, we redesigned the WordPerfect
   converter to us a unique "two-pass" architecture. By scanning
   through a WordPerfect document twice, the converter is able to
   reliably convert many more formatting features with almost no
   decrease in performance.

</PRE><h3>Underline Format Combinations</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   WordPerfect allows double underlining of words and spaces or words
   and tabs only. In Word 6.0, double underline is applied
   continuously. Word 6.0 now detects these two underline format
   combinations and makes the necessary calculations to turn the
   double underline format and off in Word to retain appearance. All
   other underline combinations with the exception of Word 6.0 dotted
   underline format, to which WordPerfect has no equivalent, are
   retained in conversion to and from WordPerfect.

   In addition, in WordPerfect if underlining is defined to begin at
   the beginning of a line and that definition is followed by any
   combination of tabs or indents, WordPerfect underlines only the
   text that follows by default. Word 6.0 now interprets this layout
   correctly, whereas in Word 2.0c the underline format extends to the
   left margin.

</PRE><h3>Vertical and Horizontal Graphic Line Positioning</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   Through use of its new drawing layer, Word 6.0 is now much more
   effective at converting and positioning WordPerfect graphic lines.
   These lines are now mapped to equivalent rectangular drawing
   objects.

   In contrast, Word 2.0c converts WordPerfect graphic lines to frames
   and experiences difficulty in properly positioning overall page
   layout due to the offsetting effect of frames on surrounding text.

</PRE><h3>Windows Metafile Support</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   WordPerfect 5.1 and 5.2 for Windows allow embedding of graphics in
   WPG format only, WPG and Windows Metafile (WMF), or WMF format
   only. Word 6.0 now retains graphics regardless of which embedding
   method was used in WordPerfect.

   In contrast, Word 2.0c does not retain graphics when opening
   WordPerfect documents if those graphics were embedded in the
   original documents in Windows Metafile format only.

</PRE><h3>WordPerfect Labels</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   Word 6.0 now detects WordPerfect Label page type and creates a
   table with appropriate row, column, page margin and paragraph
   indent dimensions to achieve the same result when printing to the
   same label sheets.

   In contrast, Word 2.0c simply separates text from each label in a
   Label document with page breaks.
