<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article contains a summary of MS-DOS partitioning information. For
information on how MS-DOS assigns drive letters, please see the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../zzzmiscellaneous/q51978.htm">Q51978</A></B>
   TITLE     : Order in Which MS-DOS Assigns Drive Letters

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
A hard disk's master boot record (MBR) is located in the first sector of
the disk (cylinder 0, side 0, sector 1). The partition table is located at
offset 01BE, containing up to four 16-byte entries. The fourth byte of
each partition table entry is used to mark the partition type.
<P>
MS-DOS began supporting hard disks in version 2.0.
<P>
<P><h3>MS-DOS Versions 2.x</h3>
 
<P>
MS-DOS 2.x supports one type 01 partition of up to 15 megabytes (MB) in
size, which uses a 12-bit file allocation table (FAT). Fdisk creates only
one MS-DOS partition per drive.
<P>
<P><h3>MS-DOS 3.0</h3>
 
<P>
MS-DOS 3.0 supports partitions larger than 15 MB using a 16-bit FAT, which
allows a smaller cluster size and more efficient disk usage. As a result,
MS-DOS 2.x hard disks larger than 15 MB are incompatible with later
versions of MS-DOS. Fdisk creates only one MS-DOS partition per drive.
<P>
<P><h3>MS-DOS 3.3</h3>
 
<P>
MS-DOS 3.3 introduces support for more than one logical drive per hard
disk. Logical drives are treated as completely separate disks under MS-DOS,
even though they may occupy the same physical hard disk.
<P>
This is supported by using nonbootable MS-DOS partitions known as extended
MS-DOS partitions. Fdisk reports these as EXT DOS; other MS-DOS partitions
are reported as PRI DOS (for primary MS-DOS). Each primary MS-DOS partition
is a logical drive, and extended MS-DOS partitions contain from 1 to 23
logical drives (MS-DOS supports drive letters up to Z). Logical drives in
extended MS-DOS partitions have the same FAT type as a primary MS-DOS
partition of the same size.
<P>
Only one PRI DOS partition and one EXT DOS partition is allowed per drive.
On computers with two physical hard disks, a PRI DOS partition is not
required on the second physical disk. A PRI DOS partition is required on
the first physical disk. (MS-DOS does not support more than two physical
disks.)
<P>
<P><h3>MS-DOS 4.0</h3>
 
<P>
MS-DOS versions 4.0 and later support logical drives larger than 32 MB.
Full usage of these logical drives requires the MS-DOS program Share.exe to
be loaded in MS-DOS 4.0.
<P>
The following table explains the versions 4.x and later MS-DOS partition
types:
<P>
<PRE>   Partition  Fdisk                                    Starting in
   Type       Reports      Size            FAT Type    MS-DOS version
   ------------------------------------------------------------------
   01         PRI DOS      0-15 MB         12-Bit      2.0 (a)
   04         PRI DOS      16-32 MB        16-Bit      3.0
   05         EXT DOS      0-2 GB (b)      n/a         3.3
   06         PRI DOS      32 MB-2 GB (b)  16-bit      4.0

   (a) 15-MB size limitation extended in version 3.0.

   (b) 2 GB (gigabytes) includes a limit of 1024 cylinders per drive
       imposed by the standard AT ROM BIOS interrupt 13 protocol.

</PRE><h3>MS-DOS 5.0</h3>
 
<P>
MS-DOS versions 5.0 and later support up to eight physical hard disks.
Share.exe is not required for full large-drive support; this support is
included in the MS-DOS kernel.
<P>
MS-DOS versions 5.0 and later support the same partitioning strategy as
version 4.x, including Fdisk's inability to create more than one primary MS-
DOS partition on a physical disk. However, because some original equipment
manufacturer (OEM) partitioning software allows you to create more than one
primary MS-DOS partition, MS-DOS versions 5.0 and later have kernel support
for up to four primary MS-DOS partitions. This makes it easier to upgrade
from previous versions of OEM-modified MS-DOS. Fdisk still creates only one
PRI DOS partition on a physical disk.
<P>
NOTE: Many OEMs have changed their versions of MS-DOS to support more than
one primary MS-DOS partition, larger type 04 partitions, and new partition
types.
<P>
<P><h3>Windows 95</h3>
 
<P>
Windows 95 supports two new partition types (0E and 0F) to support the
logical block addressing (LBA) INT13h extensions as specified in the
Windows 95 Driver Development Kit (DDK).
<P>
<PRE>   Partition  Fdisk                                    Starting in
   Type       Reports      Size            FAT Type    version
   ------------------------------------------------------------------
   01         PRI DOS      0-15 MB         12-Bit      MS-DOS 2.0
   04         PRI DOS      16-32 MB        16-Bit      MS-DOS 3.0
   05         EXT DOS      0-2 GB          n/a         MS-DOS 3.3
   06         PRI DOS      32 MB-2 GB      16-bit      MS-DOS 4.0
   0E         PRI DOS      32 MB-2 GB      16-bit      Windows 95
   OF         EXT DOS      0-2 GB          n/a         Windows 95

</PRE>NOTE: Type 0E is the same partition type as 06, and 0F is the same as 05.
However, applications should use the (LBA) INT13h extension's read/write
functions to read from or write to the drive instead of the normal
Cylinder/Head/SectorPerTrack (CHS) INT13h functions because the hard disk
has more than 1024 cylinders and/or more than 16,711,680 sectors. Note
that earlier versions of FDISK recognize these Windows 95 partitions as
NON-DOS partitions.
