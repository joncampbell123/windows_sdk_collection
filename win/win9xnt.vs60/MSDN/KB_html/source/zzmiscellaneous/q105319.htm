The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows 95, versions 7.0, 7.0a
<LI>Microsoft Word for the Macintosh, versions 5.0, 5.1, 5.1a, 6.0, 6.0.1
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If you are using Word 5.x for the Macintosh, you need a converter to read
documents that were created in any of the following versions of Word:

<UL><LI>Word 6.0 for Windows

<LI>Word 6.0 for Windows NT

<LI>Word for Windows 95 version 7.0

<LI>Word 6.0 for the Macintosh
<P>
</UL>Word 5.x users that don't have access to Word 6.0 for the Macintosh, can
obtain this converter by ordering or downloading the Word 6.0 Converter Kit
(for Word 5.x for the Macintosh users).
<P>
Alternatively, if a complete installation of Word 6.0 exists on the same
Macintosh computer as Word 5.x, the converter is immediately available for
installation and use with Word 5.x.
<P>
For information on obtaining and installing the converter, see the
appropriate section below.

</PRE>- If you are unable to access the source listed above, you can order
<PRE>   the converter by returning the Supplemental Offers coupon included in
   your Word 6.0 for the Macintosh package. Alternatively, you can have
   the converter mailed to you by calling the Microsoft Order Desk at
   (800) 360-7561 and requesting the Microsoft Word 6.0 Converter
   Kit (for Word 5.x for the Macintosh Users). If you are outside the
   United States, contact the Microsoft subsidiary for your area. To locate
   your subsidiary, see the Microsoft World Wide Offices Web site at:

      <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/worldwide/default.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/worldwide/default.htm</A></B>

   NOTE: Because the Microsoft Web site is constantly updated, the site
   address may change without notice. If this occurs, link to the Microsoft

</PRE><h3>Installing the Converter as Supplied with Word 6.0 for the Macintosh</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Quit Microsoft Word if it is running on your Macintosh.

<P><LI>Copy the file "Word 6.0 for Windows&amp;Macintosh" from the Microsoft folder
   existing at the same level as your Word 6.0 folder to the Word Commands
   subfolder in your Word 5.x folder. If this file is not available, run
   Word 6.0 Setup again to install the converter and repeat step 2.

<P><LI>Move the file "Word 6.0 for Windows/Macintosh" to the trash if it
   exists in the Word Commands folder. This similarly named file is an
   earlier version of the converter that can only interpret Word 6.0 for
   Windows documents.

<P><LI>Restart Word 5.x. The converter should now be properly installed.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Although the converter is called "Word 6.0 for Windows&amp;Macintosh" and the
Word 7.0 file is referenced as Word 6.0 for Windows during conversion, the
converter is the correct one to use when converting Word 7.0 for Windows
files.
<P>
This kit is not required to open Word 5.x for the Macintosh files into Word
6.0 and 7.0 for Windows or Word 6.0 for the Macintosh. Both programs
recognize and interpret Word 5.x for the Macintosh format automatically.
<P>
Those formatting features in Word 6.0 or 7.0 that do not exist in Word 5.0
or 5.1 for the Macintosh are not retained in conversion. A list of
converter limitations is included in the file "Word 6.0 Conversion
Information," which is installed with the converter.
<P>
If you have questions about installing or using the converter, in the
United States call Product Support Services at (425) 635-7200 between 6:00
A.M. and 6:00 P.M. Pacific time. Outside the United States, contact your
local Microsoft subsidiary.
