<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After you select the "Save this password in your password list" check box
in any logon dialog box, you are prompted for your password the next time
you try to use the same resource, even though the password has not changed.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem can occur if the password list file is damaged. Sometimes 
such damage is detected by Windows 95. When this occurs, Windows 95 offers
to delete the damaged file. However, some types of damage are not 
detected.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Locate and delete or rename your password list file. The file is named
&lt;Username&gt;.pwl, where &lt;Username&gt; is the name you use to log on, and should
be located in the Windows folder. After you delete or rename the file,
restart Windows 95.
