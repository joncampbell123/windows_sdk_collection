The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Schedule+, version 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In a pure MS Mail Postoffice environment, Schedule+ 1.0 and Schedule+ 7.0
have several interoperability issues. The information provided here assumes
that you have brand new Schedule+ 7.0 users, or that you migrated from
Schedule+ 1.0 and cleaned up the original Schedule+ 1.0 calendar files. If
you are not sure that the original files were cleaned up, run the Adminsch
program and choose Administration-Clean Up Schedule Files after the
migration.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
On a Single PO:

<UL><LI>Free/Busy Information:
<P>
   From a Schedule+ 1.0 user looking at a Schedule+ 7.0 user:
<P>
   CAN:
<P><PRE>    - You can see free/busy information for a Schedule+ 7.0 user, but that
      is all.
</PRE>   CANNOT:
<P><PRE>    - You can not see planner details.
    - You can not open a Schedule+ 7.0 appointment book.
</PRE><P>
   From a Schedule+ 7.0 user looking at a Schedule+ 1.0 user:
<P>
   CAN:
<P><PRE>    - You can see free/busy information for a Schedule+ 1.0 user.
    - You can do all messaging. But Schedule+ 1.0 does not accept recurring
      meeting requests. Meeting Cancellations from Schedule+ 7.0 to
      Schedule+ 1.0 will not provide the Remove from Schedule option. You
      will need to manually delete the appointment. Also, if the Schedule+
      7.0 sender moves the meeting, the Schedule+ 1.0 user will need to
      manually delete the old meeting.
    - You can open a Schedule+ 1.0 appointment book, depending on the
      permissions given by the Schedule+ 1.0 user, but you can only create
      appointments and meetings on the other person's appointment book. You
      cannot create tasks, events, contacts or any recurring items
      (including recurring appointments and meetings). You can modify
      recurring appointments that the Schedule+ 1.0 user created on their
      appointment book, but you can not create them for them.
</PRE>
<LI>Delegate/Manager:
<P>
   Both the manager and the delegate need to be running the same version of
   Schedule+.
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Resource:
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      From a Schedule+ 1.0 user looking at a Schedule+ 7.0 resource:
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      CANNOT:
       - Resources cannot autobook, but here is a workaround:
<PRE></PRE>         1. Resource is currently logged into Schedule+ 7.0.
         2. The This Account is for a Resource option is checked.
         3. The Auto Accept and Auto Decline options are checked.
         4. Unless there is a conflicting meeting, in which case the mail
            will just sit in the inbox until someone deals with it. Because
            of this situation, we recommend that you assign a delegate to
            the resource, so they can watch for conflicting appointments.

      From a Schedule+ 7.0 user looking at a Schedule+ 1.0 resource:

      CANNOT:
       - Resources cannot autobook. For additional information, please see

</PRE></UL>For Multiple POs:

<UL><LI>Free/Busy Information:
<P>
   For free/busy information to be seen, you must either have dynamic
   connections setup or run Schdist.exe. You can run dynamic connections
   and Schdist.exe at the same time.
<P>
   From a Schedule+ 1.0 user on one PO, to a Schedule+ 7.0 user on a second
   PO:
<P>
   CAN:
<P><PRE>    - Send meeting requests
    - View free/busy time if using Schdist. Dynamic Connections might not
      work consistently and therefore, are not recommended.
</PRE><P>
   CANNOT:
<P><PRE>    - View details of the Schedule+ 7.0 users' appointments from the Open
      Other's Appointments command on the File menu or Planner.
</PRE><P>
   From a Schedule+ 7.0 user on one PO, to a Schedule+ 1.0 user on a second
   PO:
<P>
   CAN:
<P><PRE>    - Send meeting requests.
    - View free/busy times.
    - View details of the Schedule+ 1.0 user's calendar if dynamic
      connections are used.
