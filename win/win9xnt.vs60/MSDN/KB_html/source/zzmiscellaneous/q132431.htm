   TITLE     : WD: How to Obtain the Updated 32-Bit Word 6.x/7.0 Converter 

</PRE><h3>Word 6.x for Macintosh</h3>
 
<P>
The U.S. release of Word 6.x for the Macintosh does not have the ability to
open Asian Word documents
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Earlier versions of the U.S. release of Word do not recognize Asian Word
files as Word documents. If you try to open a Japanese Word document into
one of these earlier Word releases, the following error message results:
<P>
<PRE>   File is not a Word document

</PRE>U.S. Word may still fail to open an Asian Word document if the converter
file has not been installed. For Word 6.0 for Windows, the converter is
only installed if you run Custom/Complete setup. For Word 7.0 for Windows
95, the converter is installed with both Typical and Custom setups.
<P>
In addition, Word will fail to open a Japanese Word document if the
converter has not been properly registered. For Word 6.0 for Windows, the
following entry must be present in the [MSWord Text Converters] section of
the Winword6.ini file beginning with the classname "MSWORDJ6." This entry
is similar to the following:
<P>
<PRE>   MSWordJ6=Word/J for Windows 6.0, &lt;path&gt;\Msword6.cnv, doc

</PRE>Neither Word nor Office Setup registers the converter with this
Winword6.ini entry. Therefore, you must autoinstall the converter. To
autoinstall the converter, complete the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Verify that Msword6.cnv is installed in thE &lt;Windows&gt;\Msapps\Textconv
   subdirectory. If not, rerun Setup to install it.

<P><LI>Quit and restart U.S. Word 6.0.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Open, and select the Confirm Conversions
   check box.

<P><LI>Select to open either a Japanese Word 6.0 document or any other file
   that Word normally cannot recognize (for example, Autoexec.bat).
<P>
   Word will now automatically register the Msword6.cnv converter in
   Winword6.ini. If you choose to open a Japanese document as a "Word/J
   for Windows 6.0" file, Word will recognize and successfully open the
   file.
<P>
   To verify that the converter has been registered, you can open the
   Winword6.ini file in Notepad and verify that the line referenced above
   exists. If not, exit Word and repeat steps 2 through 4, choosing to
   open the Autoexec.bat file.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: An erroneous "Word for the Macintosh 6.0" file type option may be
selected in Word when you try to open Japanese Word 6.0 documents for the
first time with Confirm Conversions active. If this occurs, select the
"Word/J for Windows 6.0" file type option and choose OK to open the file.
<P>
For Word 7.0 for Windows 95, the converter must be installed through setup
and then at that time can be replaced by the updated converter. This is so
that the following registry information can be recorded for the converter
in KEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Word\7.0\Text
Converters\Import\MSWordJ6:
<P>
<PRE>   Extensions = "doc"
   Name       = "Word (Asian Versions) 6.0-7.0
   Path       = "&lt;path&gt;\mswrd632.cnv"

</PRE></OL>If this information is not present in the registry, rerun Setup, choose to
remove the Word 6.0-7.0 Windows/Macintosh Converter, and then reinstall
that converter. The registry entry above should now be present.
