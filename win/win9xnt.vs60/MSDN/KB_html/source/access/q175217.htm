The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access versions 7.0, 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
When you use the Lookup Wizard to create a field that looks up or lists
values from a table, and the first field name in the lookup table has the
same field name as the lookup field that you are creating, you may receive
theerror
<P>
<PRE>   You already have a field named &lt;'fieldname'&gt;

</PRE>if you click to select the Hide Key Column check box when you create the
field.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Make sure that the Hide Key Column check box is not selected when you see
the screen that asks "How wide would you like the columns in your lookup
column?"
<P>
The following steps describe how to create the lookup field:

<OL><P><LI>Start Microsoft Access and open the sample database Northwind.mdb.

<P><LI>Create a new table in Design view, and add a text field named Field1.
    Save the table as Table1, and click Yes when prompted if you want to
    create a primary key now.

<P><LI>Create a second table in Design view, and add a text field named ID.

<P><LI>Add a second field named Test. In the Data Type column, click the
    down arrow and select the LookUp Wizard.

<P><LI>When the Lookup Wizard starts, select the default option "I want the
    lookup column to look up the values in a table or query" and then
    click Next.

<P><LI>On the second screen of the Lookup Wizard, under "Which table or query
    should provided the values for your lookup column?", select Table1, and
    then click Next.

<P><LI>On the third screen of the Lookup Wizard, move both fields under
    Available Fields to the Selected Fields box by clicking the &gt;&gt; button,
    and then click Next.

<P><LI>On the fourth screen of the Lookup Wizard, which asks "How wide would
    you like the columns in your lookup column?", make sure that the Hide
    Key Column check box is not selected, and then click Next.

<P><LI>On the fifth screen of the Lookup Wizard, select Field1 in the
    Available Fields box, and then click Next.

<P><LI>On the sixth screen of the Lookup Wizard, which asks "What label would
    you like for your lookup column?", notice that the suggested label for
    the lookup column is Test. Click Finish, and then click Yes to the
    message that says that "The table must be saved before relationships
    can be created. Save now?".

<P><LI>In the Save As dialog box, click OK to save the table with the default
    name Table2, and then click No when you see the message "There is no
    primary key defined."
<P>
    Note that the table is saved with the lookup field without an error.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Repeat steps 1 - 7 in the "Resolution" section.

<P><LI>On the screen that asks "How wide would you like the columns in your
   lookup column", make sure the Hide Key Column check box is selected, and
   then click Next.

<P><LI>When you see the screen that asks "What label would you like for your
   lookup column?", notice that the suggested label for the lookup column
   is Test. Click Finish, and then click Yes to the message "The table must
   be saved before relationships can be created. Save now?".

<P><LI>In the Save As dialog box, click OK to save the table with the default
   name Table2, and then click No when you see the message "There is no
   primary key defined."  The field name has now been changed from Test
   to ID and you receive the error message:
<P>
<P><PRE>      You already have a field named 'ID'
