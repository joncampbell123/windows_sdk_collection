The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access version 2.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multiuser skills.
<P>
This article describes how to create and use an Access Basic Sub procedure
called GetFormDimensions to obtain a form window's right and down
measurements for use in the MoveSize macro action. This article also
demonstrates how to position a form immediately below or to the right of a
second form.
<P>
This article assumes that you are familiar with Access Basic and with
creating Microsoft Access applications using the programming tools provided
with Microsoft Access. For more information on Access Basic, please refer
to the "Building Applications" manual.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Access version 2.0, you can use the WindowWidth and
WindowHeight form properties to determine the current width and height of
the window a form is contained in. However, there are no properties to
determine the window's right and down measurements (these measurements are
commonly used in the MoveSize macro action to position a form window).
<P>
The right and down measurements, along with the width and height, are
useful if you want to position a form side-by-side with another form. The
following examples demonstrate how to create and use the GetFormDimensions
<PRE>Sub procedure to obtain these measurements and use them to position a form
</PRE>to the right of, and then below, another form using the MoveSize macro
action.
<P>
NOTE: In the following sample code, an underscore (_) at the end of a line
is used as a line-continuation character. Remove the underscore from the
end of the line when re-creating this code in Access Basic.
