<PRE>Feature                    Description
</PRE> 
<PRE>Lightweight forms          Enables you to open forms and reports faster
and reports                than in previous versions because there is no
                           class module attached to the object.

Delayed loading            Software components that are not required
                           for all databases, such as Visual Basic for
                           Applications and Data Access Objects, do not
                           load into memory until they are needed.

Improved call-tree         Modules, including form modules, do not load
loading                    into memory until the Visual Basic code in them
                           is executed.

                           controls.

Lookup fields              Data in a lookup field that comes from another
                           table does not automatically refresh when the
                           other table is updated. You can refresh the
                           data manually by pressing F9.

Analyzer Wizard            The Analyzer Wizard analyzes your database,
                           suggests the best ways to optimize its speed
                           and performance, and then automatically makes
                           the changes that you approve.
