The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access versions 1.0, 1.1

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
You can improve the performance of Microsoft Access by altering the memory
configuration on your computer. This article lists several tips that you
can use to enhance the performance of Microsoft Access on a computer with
4 MB of memory.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following tips can be used to enhance the performance of Microsoft
Access versions 1.0 and 1.1 on computers with 4MB of RAM:

<UL><LI>Do not use any of your RAM for a RAM disk.

<LI>Use a maximum of 512K for SMARTDrive or other disk caches.

<LI>Set your network installation to use less than 200K of RAM, if
   possible.

<LI>Do not run several other applications that require large amounts of
   memory. Running even one other large application (such as a
   spreadsheet, word processor, or alternate desktop manager such as
   Norton Desktop for Windows) can significantly degrade the performance
   of Microsoft Access.

<LI>Run Windows in standard mode.

<LI>Set the maxbuffersize entry under the [isam] section in the
   MSACCESS.INI file to a value less than 512. In low memory cases this
   will help, even though less memory will be used by Microsoft Access for
   buffering database I/O. (See the Microsoft Access README.TXT file for
   details on setting this value.)

<LI>Open databases as exclusive and read-only, if possible.

<LI>If you do not want to use Access Wizards, you can disable them by
   removing the line "WIZARD.MDA=RO" from the [Libraries] section of the
   MSACCESS.INI file. This frees up over 300K of RAM, but takes away the
   ability to use Access Wizards.

<LI>Keep the number of Windows accessory applications running to a minimum.

<LI>If you have a full-screen background bitmap (or "wallpaper") on your
   Windows desktop, replace it with a smaller bitmap, or no bitmap at all.
   For a standard VGA video display, this frees about 256K. For a 1024x768
   256 color display, this can free about 3/4 of a megabyte. (Your actual
   memory savings may vary, depending on the display.)

<LI>Keep in mind that CD-ROM device drivers, sound board drivers, screen
   savers, MIDI drivers, multi-media support drivers, and other drivers
   take extra memory. The 4 MB recommendation does not take this into
   account. If you need to have several drivers running under Windows,
   then more memory than 4 MB will be required for Microsoft Access to run
   efficiently.
<P>
</UL>The 4 MB RAM recommendation was based on a 386/20 computer, MS-DOS 5.0,
unmodified Windows 3.1, VGA display, mouse, and network workstation
software. If your configuration is similar to, or better than this, you
will get good performance. (This has been verified by benchmarks with
Microsoft Access fully installed.) However, if your system's configuration
is more sophisticated, you will require more memory for peak Microsoft
Access performance.
