The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access versions 1.0, 1.1, 2.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multiuser skills.
<P>
If you start Microsoft Access as the Admin user (which occurs by default),
and then remove the user Admin from the Admins group, you will not be able
to go back and make the user Admin a member of the Admins group during
this session.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
As soon as you remove the user Admin from the Admins group, this change is
written to the Microsoft Access system tables. At this point, the Admin
user no longer has permission to add anyone to the Admins group, including
itself.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To add the user Admin back to the group Admins, you must log on as another
user who is in the Admins group.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior no longer occurs in Microsoft Access for Windows 95, version
7.0. In version 7.0, if you try to delete the Admin from the Admins group
while you are logged in as Admin, you will receive the error "can't
perform this operation."
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Change the password for the user Admin from blank to some nonblank
   password. (NOTE: This will enable you to bring up the Log On dialog
   box at the start of the next session.)

<P><LI>IMPORTANT: Create a new user and add this user to the Admins group.
   (There must always be at least one user in the group Admins.
   Remember that you are currently logged in as the user Admin.)

<P><LI>Remove the user Admin from the Admins group.

<P><LI>Try to add the user Admin back to the Admins group. Note that you
   receive the error:
<P>
<P><PRE>      No permission for 'Admin'
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    If you leave the Security menu and return to change the settings, you
    will receive the error:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>        'No Permission for MSysGroups'

</PRE><P><LI>Quit Microsoft Access and restart it.
<P>
   The Log On dialog box will appear because of the change you made in
   step 1.

<P><LI>Log on as the user that you created in step 2.

<P><LI>Add the user Admin back to the Admins group.
<P>
   NOTE: To disable the Log On dialog box, you must change the Admin
   password back to an empty string (do not enter any information in
   the New Password or Verify fields).
