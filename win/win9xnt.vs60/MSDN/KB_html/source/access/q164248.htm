The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
This article discusses reasons why a Web browser displays a blank screen
when you browse an ASP file created from a Microsoft Access 97 form, and
provides troubleshooting steps for resolving the problem.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
There are three common reasons why a Web browser may not display an ASP
file created from a Microsoft Access 97 form.
<P>
<P><h3>Incorrect Server URL</h3>
 
<P>
You entered an incorrect Server URL (Uniform Resource Locator) in the
Microsoft Active Server Pages Output Options dialog box when you exported
the form to ASP format.
<P>
To resolve this problem, export the form again and recreate the ASP files.
Specify the correct Server URL in the Microsoft Active Server Pages Output
Options dialog box that appears when you export the form.
<P>
When you create ASP files, Microsoft Access creates several files. The
Server URL information in an ASP file stores the location of supporting ASP
files that are necessary to display the form. The Server URL is the
location where the ASP files are stored on your Web server. For example, if
you store ASP files in the \ASPsamp folder on the \\PubTest server,
<B>http://pubtest/aspsamp/</B> is your Server URL. If you enter an incorrect
Server URL when you create the ASP files, the main ASP file may not be able
to locate a supporting ASP file, causing the Web browser to display
nothing.
<P>
<P><h3>Forms Exported to ASP Require Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0 or Later</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft Access 97 forms in ASP format require the HTML Layout Control.
You must browse the form using Microsoft Internet Explorer, version 3.0 or
later, with the ActiveX HTML Layout control installed.
<P>
NOTE: The HTML Layout Control does not exist for Macintosh computers.
<P>
NOTE: You can browse other Microsoft Access database objects in ASP file
format using any Web browser.
<P>
The ActiveX HTML layout control is typically installed when you run Setup
for Microsoft Internet Explorer version 3.0 or later. However, the Setup
program gives you the option not to install the control. If you do not
install it, your Web browser cannot display a Microsoft Access 97 form in
ASP format.
<P>
If you use the Microsoft Internet Explorer Administration Kit (IEAK) to
redistribute customized installations of Internet Explorer, be sure to
include the HTML Layout Control if you want to browse ASP files created
from Microsoft Access 97 forms.
<P>
To check if the HTML Layout Control is on your computer, verify that the
file Isctrls.ocx is in your Windows\System folder. If it is not, you can
install it from Microsoft's Web site at the following address:
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/workshop/author/cpad/">http://www.microsoft.com/workshop/author/cpad/</A></B>

</PRE>When you install the control from the Web site, it is properly registered
on your computer. However, if you simply copy Isctrls.ocx to your hard
drive, you must register it manually using the Register Server program,
Regsvr32.exe. Run the following command on your computer, substituting the
correct path to your copies of Regsvr32.exe and Isctrls.ocx:
<P>
<PRE>   C:\Windows\System\Regsvr32.exe C:\Windows\System\Isctrls.ocx

</PRE>If you do not have Regsvr32.exe on your computer, please see the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base for information about obtaining
Register Server:

</PRE>For more information about server and browser requirements in Microsoft
Access 97, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../access/q159325.htm">Q159325</A></B>

               Wizard

</PRE><h3>The Form That You Exported Is Too Complex</h3>
 
<P>
When you export forms to ASP format, Microsoft Access 97 automatically
generates the VB Script you need to support features such as basic
navigation buttons, combo boxes, and subforms. No VB Script is generated
for any code behind a form, nor for any expressions in controls or
properties. If your form relies on Visual Basic for Applications code or
expressions to run successfully, then you may receive error messages when
you browse the ASP file, or your Web browser may not display anything at
all.
<P>
For example, the Customer Orders form in the Northwind sample database
contains two subforms. The LinkMasterFields property of the second subform
refers to a field in the first subform, and the Current event of the first
subform contains code that requeries the second subform as you browse
records. If you export the Customer Orders form to ASP format, your Web
browser will not display it because the VB Script that Microsoft Access 97
generates does not include the expression in the LinkMasterFields property
of the second subform, or the code in the OnCurrent property of the first
subform.
<P>
If the ControlSource of the Address text box on the Northwind sample
database Customers form is deleted, the resulting .asp page will have a
blank Address field and all the fields above it will be missing.
<P>
If the ControlSource is given an expression, like = "soup", the .asp
Address text box contains "#Expression", and the controls above it are
visible on the form.
<P>
You can work around this behavior by exporting forms that do not require
code behind them, and that do not require expressions in their controls and
properties.
