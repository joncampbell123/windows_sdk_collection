The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Novice: Requires knowledge of the user interface on single-user computers.
<P>
When you try to import a form or report created in Microsoft Access 7.0
or earlier, the object is not imported, and you may receive the following
error messages:
<P>
<PRE>   The form or report &lt;object name&gt; has too many controls.

</PRE>This may be followed with the message:
<P>
<PRE>   Invalid operation.

   -or-

   Unexpected error (32811)

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The number of controls and sections on the form or report plus the number
of record source fields selected in the RecordSource property of the form
or report is greater than 754.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Use the version of Microsoft Access with which you created the object to
reduce the total number of controls, sections, and the fields selected in
the object's RecordSource property to 754 or fewer, and then import the
form or report again.
<P>
If the record source of the object that you are trying to import contains a
large number of fields that you do not need to display, consider creating a
query that only selects the fields that you need, and then set the
RecordSource property of the form or report to that query.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Access 97 has an internal limit of 754 total controls, sections,
and record source fields for forms and reports. For example, if a form
contains a Detail section, 500 unbound text boxes, and a record source
which contains 255 fields, you will not be able to import the form into
Microsoft Access 97 because the total combined number of controls,
sections, and fields is greater than 754:
<P>
<PRE>                  Number of controls: 500
                  Number of sections:   1
   Number of Fields in record source: 255
                                      ---
                                      756

</PRE>Note that the number of fields in the record source contributes to the 754
item limit, even if you do not actually use any of the record source fields
in your form or report.
