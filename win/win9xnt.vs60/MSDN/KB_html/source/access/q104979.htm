<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you are using a main/subform and the RecordSource properties of
both forms are attached SQL Server tables, performance is reduced. The
select syntax is sent to ODBC as a parameter query, in which the data
types of the linked fields are not known.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Using a main/subform with attached SQL Server tables results in a
parameter query for the subform's RecordSource property. All fields in
which the linked field of the subform is equal to the linked field in
the main form are selected for the subform. Parameter queries based on
attached ODBC tables run slowly when the data type of the field in the
WHERE clause is unknown.
<P>
To work around this problem, use the following procedure:
<P>
NOTE: The following example is based on the sample database NWIND.MDB,
in which the Employees and Orders tables are exported, attached, SQL
Server tables. The main form is called frmMain and the subform is
called frmSub. The linked field is Employee_ID. This example also
assumes that the RecordSource properties of the two forms are the
Employees and Orders tables, respectively.

<OL><P><LI>Delete the Employee_ID field name in the LinkChildFields and
   LinkMasterFields properties of the subform control on the main
   form.

<P><LI>Create a query based on the attached Orders table. Specify
   Forms!frmMain!Employee_ID as the criteria of the linked field.

<P><LI>Switch to Design view. From the Query menu, choose Parameters.

<P><LI>Specify the query parameter as Forms!frmMain!Employee_ID and the
   data type as Long Integer.

<P><LI>Change the RecordSource property of the subform to reflect your new
   query.
<P>
   The main/subform behaves the same as before, except that the
   subform's query and the control on the main form maintain the link
   through a parameter query.
<P>
</OL>These concepts apply to any form where the subform is based on an
attached ODBC table.
