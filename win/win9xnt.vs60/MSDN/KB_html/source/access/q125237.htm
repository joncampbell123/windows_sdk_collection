</PRE><h3>What Is the Microsoft Access Database Structure Wizard?</h3>
 
<P>
The Database Structure Wizard is a tool to assist you in documenting
and troubleshooting Microsoft Access database applications. It
generates tables that detail the organization, structure, and settings
of your Microsoft Access database files.
<P>
The Database Structure Wizard is an updated and improved version of
the Database Analyzer utility included in Microsoft Access version
1.x. It features improved customization and flexibility and takes
advantage of many new features found in Microsoft Access version 2.0.
<P>
It is important to note that the Database Structure Wizard is not a
full-featured reporting tool; sample reports are provided only as
examples of how you might organize and present the data collected by
the Database Structure Wizard. The wizard's main function is to
provide you with raw data about your database files that you can use
to create custom reports.
<P>
<P><h3>What Is the Database Structure Wizard Support Policy?</h3>
 
<P>
The Database Structure Wizard was created by a team of Support Engineers
from Microsoft Technical Support and is provided as an unsupported tool.
Microsoft Technical Support does not provide support for this tool beyond
installing it.
<P>
<P><h3>How Do I Install the Database Structure Wizard?</h3>
 
<P>
Follow these steps to install the Database Structure Wizard:

<OL><P><LI>Insert the WX1050 disk in the appropriate disk drive.

<P><LI>Start Microsoft Access and open any database.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Add-ins, then from the menu that
   appears, choose Add-in Manager.

<P><LI>In the Add-in Manager dialog box, choose the Add New button.

<P><LI>In the Drives box in the Add New Library dialog box, select the
   drive containing the WX1050 disk.

<P><LI>In the File Name box, select WZSTRUC2.MDA (the Database Structure
   Wizard file) and then choose the OK button.

<P><LI>Choose the Close button.

<P><LI>Quit and then restart Microsoft Access.
<P>
</OL>For more detailed information about installing and removing the
Database Structure Wizard, see the WZSTRUC2.HLP Help file included

<P>
<P><h3>What Files Are Included with the Database Structure Wizard?</h3>
 
<P>
The Database Structure Wizard includes the following files:

</PRE></OL>Installation of the Help files is optional. If you install them, make
sure to copy them to the Microsoft Access directory along with the
WZSTRUC2.MDA file. You can delete the Help files later to save room on
your hard disk. If you delete the Help files, you will receive an
error message if you request help while you are using the Database
Structure Wizard.

designed to work with an analysis of the NWIND.MDB sample database.

reports, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Start Microsoft Access and open the sample database NWIND.MDB.
