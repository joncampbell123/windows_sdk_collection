<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
This article describes how to use Visual Basic for Applications code (or
Access Basic code in version 2.0) to deselect the records that have been
selected in a form using the record selectors.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To deselect the selected records, use the following statement:
<P>
<PRE>   Screen.ActiveControl.SetFocus

</PRE>Although you may have selected multiple records in a form, there is still
one active control in the form. Setting the focus to the active control is
equivalent to pressing the TAB key or using the mouse to select the active
control, which removes the current selection of records.
<P>
The following example demonstrates how you can use this statement to
prevent a user from selecting multiple records on a form.

<OL><P><LI>Open the sample database Northwind.mdb (or NWIND.MDB in version 2.0).

<P><LI>Open the Orders form in Form view.

<P><LI>Move to a record with multiple orders. Select multiple records on the
   subform by holding the SHIFT key and clicking the record selector button
   to the left of each Product field (or Product ID field in version 2.0).
   Note that you can select more than one record at a time.

<P><LI>Open the Orders Subform in Design view.

<P><LI>Set the form's OnMouseUp property to the following event procedure:
<P>
   NOTE: In the following sample code, an underscore (_) at the end of a
   line is used as a line-continuation character. Remove the underscore
   from the end of the line when re-creating this code in Access Basic.
<P>
<P><PRE>      Private Sub Form_MouseUP (Button As Integer, Shift As Integer, X As _
<PRE></PRE>                                Single, Y As Single)
         Screen.ActiveControl.SetFocus
      End Sub

   NOTE: The word Private does not appear at the beginning of the procedure
   in version 2.0.

</PRE><P><LI>Save the Orders Subform and close it.

<P><LI>Open the Orders form in Form view.

<P><LI>Move to a record with multiple orders. Select multiple records on the
   subform by holding the SHIFT key and clicking the record selector button
   to the left of each Product field (or Product ID field in version 2.0).
   Note that you cannot select more than one record at a time.
