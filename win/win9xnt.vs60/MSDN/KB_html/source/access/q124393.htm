The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access version 2.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multiuser skills.
<P>
This article describes how to detect and run code when Microsoft Access is
activated or deactivated. Switching to Microsoft Access from another
application activates Microsoft Access, and switching from Microsoft Access
to another application deactivates Microsoft Access.
<P>
This article assumes that you are familiar with Access Basic and with
creating Microsoft Access applications using the programming tools provided
with Microsoft Access. For more information about Access Basic, please
refer to the "Building Applications" manual.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following steps demonstrate how to create a form called
Access_Activation that will detect when Microsoft Access is activated or
deactivated. The form contains two empty procedures called Access_Activate
and Access_Deactivate into which you can insert the code you want to run
when Microsoft Access is activated or deactivated. When the
Access_Activation form is open in Form view, switching to Microsoft Access
from another application will cause the Access_Activate procedure to run.
Switching from Microsoft Access to another application will cause the
Access_Deactivate procedure to run.
<P>
The Access_Activation form must be open in order to detect when Microsoft
Access is activated and deactivated. To make sure the form is always open,
you could open the form in a hidden state in your database's Autoexec
macro. To open the form in a hidden state, set the Window Mode argument of
the OpenForm macro action to Hidden.

<OL><P><LI>Open any database and create a blank new form. Set the following
   properties for the form:
<P>
<P><PRE>      OnTimer: [Event Procedure]
      TimerInterval: 500
</PRE>
<P><LI>From the View menu, choose Code. Type the following lines in the
   form module's Declarations section.
<P>
   NOTE: In the following sample code, an underscore (_) at the end of a
   line is used as a line-continuation character. Remove the underscore
   from the end of the line when re-creating this code in Access Basic.
<P>
<P><PRE>      Option Explicit
      Declare Function GetActiveWindow Lib "User" () As Integer
      Declare Function GetParent Lib "User" (ByVal hWnd As Integer) _
      As Integer

<P><LI>Enter the following code for the OnTimer property event procedure:

         Dim AccesshWnd As Integer

         ' Get the Microsoft Access window handle (hWnd).
         AccesshWnd = GetAccesshWnd()

         ' Get the active application window handle (hWnd).
         CurrhWnd = GetActiveApphWnd()

         ' The first time through, just record the current
         ' window handle.
         If ActiveApphWnd = 0 Then
            ActiveApphWnd = CurrhWnd
            Exit Sub
         End If

         ' Determine if the current window handle differs from the
         ' previous window handle (focus change).

            ' Record the current window handle.
            ActiveApphWnd = CurrhWnd

            ' Determine if the current handle is the Microsoft Access
            ' handle (activate Microsoft Access?).
            If ActiveApphWnd = AccesshWnd Then
               Access_Activate
            Else
               Access_Deactivate

</OL><h3>How to Use the Access_Activation Form</h3>
 
<P>
The following steps demonstrate how to use the Access_Activation form:

<OL><P><LI>Open any database and create the Access_Activation form as described
   above.

<P><LI>Substitute the following Access_Activate procedure for the
   Access_Activate procedure you created in step 4 above:
<P>
<PRE>      Sub Access_Activate ()
         MsgBox "Microsoft Access was activated"
      End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>View the Access_Activation form in Form view.

<P><LI>Press ALT+TAB to switch from Microsoft Access to another application.

<P><LI>Press ALT+TAB to switch back to Microsoft Access. A message box with
   the text "Microsoft Access was activated" is displayed.
