The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access 7.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server, versions 3.51, 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation, versions 3.51, 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
When you use the Filter By Form command on a form with two nested subforms,
and you move between main form records, you may receive an error message
similar to the following:
<P>
<PRE>   An application error has occurred and an application log is being
   generated.

   MSACCESS.EXE

   Exception: access violation (0xc0000005), Address: 0x500b96e1

</PRE><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
The only workaround is to avoid the circumstances that cause the error:

<UL><LI>If you use two levels of nested subforms in a database on Microsoft
   Windows NT, don't use the Filter By Form command.

<LI>If you must use the Filter By Form command with two levels of nested
   subforms, then run the command on a computer running Windows 95.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Access version
7.0. This problem no longer occurs in Microsoft Access 97.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 
<P>
WARNING: Following these steps will cause an invalid page fault on your
computer. Make sure you save and close any open work on your computer
before following these steps.

<OL><P><LI>Open the sample database Northwind.mdb.

<P><LI>Open the Customers form in Design view.

<P><LI>On the Window menu, click Tile Vertically so that you can see both the
   form and the Database window.

<P><LI>Drag the Orders form from the Database window to the bottom of the
   detail section of the Customers form. Because the Orders form already
   contains a subform, this creates two levels of nested subforms on the
   Customers form.

<P><LI>On the View menu, click Form.

<P><LI>On the Records menu, point to Filter, and then click Filter By Form.

<P><LI>Type T* in the Customer ID field on the Customers form.

<P><LI>On the Filter menu, click Apply Filter/Sort.

<P><LI>Use the record navigation buttons at the bottom of the Customers form to
   move through the main form records. Note that the error occurs.
<P>
   NOTE: You may have to move through two or more records to generate the
   error.
<P></OL>
