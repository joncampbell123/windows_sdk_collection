<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how to create a Subtract query to compare two
tables and return a dynaset that includes only those records from the
first table that do not have matching records in the second table.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following example demonstrates how to create a query on two joined
tables that subtracts the matching records, returning only those records
that do not match on the joined field:
<P>
NOTE: The following example assumes that you have two tables in your
database called Table1 and Table2 that can be joined on at least one
field.

<OL><P><LI>Create a new query based on Table1 and Table2.

<P><LI>Join the two tables on the appropriate field. Microsoft Access will
   join the tables automatically if there is an underlying relationship
   between them.

<P><LI>Double-click the join line between the tables. In the Join Properties
   dialog box, select either type 2 or type 3, whichever is most
   appropriate for your data. For this example, you want all the records
   from Table1 and only those that match from Table2--a type 2 join.

<P><LI>Drag the joined field from Table2 to the query grid. Clear the Show
   check box. Set the Criteria field to "Is Null" (without quotation
   marks).

<P><LI>Drag any other needed fields from Table1, such as the primary key
   field, to the query grid. These are the columns that identify
   unmatched records.

<P><LI>Run the query. The Is Null condition in the first column ensures that
   only those records from Table1 that do not have a match in Table2
   will be returned.
<P>
</OL>The following is a sample SQL SELECT statement that uses the sample
database NWIND.MDB. It returns all the customers who have not placed an
order:
<P>
<PRE>   SELECT DISTINCTROW Customers.[Company Name]
   FROM Orders, Customers,
   Customers LEFT JOIN Orders
   ON Customers.[Customer ID] = Orders.[Customer ID]
   WHERE ((Orders.[Customer ID] Is Null));

</PRE></OL><h2>REFERENCES</h2>
 
<P>

"Find Unmatched Query Wizard" then "Creating a Query with a Wizard" using
the Microsoft Access Help menu.
