The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access versions 1.0, 1.1, 2.0, 7.0, 97
</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
This article describes some of the anomalies that can occur when you are
using Microsoft Access with networks that have not been tested with
Microsoft Access. These networks include DEC Pathworks, Sun PC-NFS, IBM
PC-LAN Server, and others.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Access has been tested and verified as supportable on the
following networks: Microsoft LAN Manager, Windows for Workgroups, Novell
NetWare versions 2.x and 3.x, Artisoft Lantastic, and Banyan VINES.
In Microsoft Access 7.0 and 97, only Microsoft Networks and Novell have
been tested and verified as supportable.
<P>
Many other network types (including IBM PC-LAN Server, DEC Pathworks, and
Sun PC-NFS) have experienced erratic behavior and only limited success with
Microsoft Access. Irregular behaviors on these network types can include:

<UL><LI>An inability to install Microsoft Access to a network drive.

<LI>An inability to run the Workstation Setup after a successful Admin
   Setup.

<LI>An inability to open a multiuser file (non-exclusively).

<LI>Multiple users cannot update a record correctly.

<LI>Unexplained database corruption or data loss.
<P>
</UL>Some of these behaviors are quite serious. We want to protect our
customers' valuable data, and the best way to do this is to support
Microsoft Access only on networks on which we have tested Microsoft Access.
We cannot support Microsoft Access on non-tested networks.
<P>
However, just because we have not tested Microsoft Access with a
particular network does not mean that the network will not work with
Microsoft Windows. Microsoft Windows has been tested with far more
networks than has Microsoft Access. It is a good idea, before purchasing
any product, to check with the product's manufacturer as to the product's
compatibility with your network.
<P>
The third-party products discussed here are manufactured by vendors
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise,
regarding these products' performance or reliability.
