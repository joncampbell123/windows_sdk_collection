<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you create a table in Microsoft Access and port it to SQL Server,
some tasks are difficult to implement because SQL Server does not
include a Counter data type. This article discusses how to maintain
the counter functionality of an attached SQL Server table.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
With a multiuser system, you must take special precautions. Assume
that the Counter column in SQL Server is called ID and that ID is the
unique index for this table. In most cases, users try to simulate
counters with a SQL Server OnInsert trigger that computes the maximum
value and adds 1. However, Microsoft Access uses that index (bookmark)
to point to the record and is not aware that the trigger is changing
the index value. Thus, Microsoft Access loses track of that record
until the next time the table is queried.
<P>
Since SQL Server triggers do not work and SQL Server does not have a
unique Counter data type as does Microsoft Access, you must use an
Access Basic function to control the counter value, as in the
procedure below:

<OL><P><LI>In a single-column, single-row Microsoft Access table, store a
   value that represents the next highest counter value.
<P>
   NOTE: You must store the table in Microsoft Access, since the
   OpenTable action does not work on an attached SQL Server table and,
   therefore, cannot open the table exclusively. For more information
   on the OpenTable action, refer to the Microsoft Access "Language
   Reference" manual.

<P><LI>In the data entry form, apply a function to the BeforeUpdate event
   so that the function completes the following tasks:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Open the table that contains the counter value
    - Grab the value for the current record
    - Add 1 to the value in the table
    - Close the table
</PRE><P>
   Each user must have exclusive access to the table to ensure that no
   duplicate values are recorded. You must do error checking when
   trying to open the table exclusively because another user may have
   the table open at the same time. If this occurs, the program loops
   and retries several times before alerting the first user.

<P><LI>Once the value has been retrieved, set the ID of the current record
   equal to that value and commit the record to the SQL Server
   database.
