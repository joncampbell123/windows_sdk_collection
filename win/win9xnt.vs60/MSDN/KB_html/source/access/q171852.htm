The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access versions 7.0, 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Novice: Requires knowledge of the user interface on single-user computers.
<P>
Microsoft Access 7.0 and 97 do not create an Import Errors table after an
import of a text file or spreadsheet fails.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The circumstances in which Microsoft Access 7.0 and 97 create an Import
Errors table have changed from earlier versions of Microsoft Access.
Microsoft Access 7.0 and 97 create an Import Errors table only in the
following situations:

<UL><LI>The data in a field is inappropriate for the data type of the
   destination field. For example, the data type of the destination
   field is numeric, but the data contains a text value.

<LI>The data in a numeric field is too large for the field size of the
   destination field. For example, the destination field has a FieldSize
   property set to Byte, but the data contains a value greater than 255.

<LI>The data you're importing contains a Null value that you attempt to
   append to an AutoNumber field (Microsoft Access 97 only).

<LI>The table to which you are appending the data contains replication
   fields.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Import Errors table contains descriptions of the errors Microsoft
Access encounters when trying to import a text file or spreadsheet. The
table includes field names and row numbers that indicate which data has
caused errors.
<P>
Versions of Microsoft Access earlier than Microsoft Access 7.0 create an
Import Errors table in the following situations:

<UL><LI>The data in a field you're importing is inappropriate for the data type
   of the destination field. For example, the destination field is a
   numeric data type, but the data contains a text value.

<LI>The data in a numeric field is too large for the field size of the
   destination field. For example, the destination field has a FieldSize
   property set to Byte, but the data contains a value greater than 255.

<LI>Records you are importing contain duplicate values that would be stored
   in the primary key of the destination table, or in any field in the
   table that has the Indexed property set to Yes (No Duplicates).

<LI>The data you're importing violates a field or table validation rule.

<LI>Records you are importing contain Null values for a field whose Required
   property is set to Yes.

<LI>The data contains records that cannot be parsed by Microsoft Access.
   This can occur when you import a text value that contains the text
   delimiter character (usually quotation marks) within the data. For
   example, the Import Errors table would contain an error entry for the
   following text data because it contains a quotation mark:
<P>
<P><PRE>      "10 - 3 1/2" disks/box"
</PRE><P>
</UL><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 
<P>
The following example attempts to import a record that violates
referential integrity into the Order Details table in the sample
database Northwind.mdb.

<OL><P><LI>Open any text editor, such as Notepad, and create the following new
    text file:
<P>
       99999,54,7.45,20,0.000

<P><LI>Save the text file as C:\My Documents\OrdDetails.txt.

<P><LI>Start Microsoft Access, and open the sample database Northwind.mdb.

<P><LI>On the File menu, point to Get External Data, and then click Import.

<P><LI>In the Import dialog box, select Text Files in the Files Of Type box.

<P><LI>Locate the folder C:\My Documents, select OrdDetails.txt, and click
    Import.

<P><LI>On the first screen of the Import Text Wizard, select the Delimited
    option, and then click Next.

<P><LI>On the second screen of the Import Text Wizard, click Next.

<P><LI>On the third screen of the Import Text Wizard, select the "In an
    Existing Table" option, and select the Order Details table from the
    list.

<P><LI>Click Finish. Note that you receive the following error message:
<P>
       Microsoft Access was unable to append all the data to the table.
<P>
       The contents of fields in 0 record(s) were deleted, and 1 record(s)
       were lost due to key violations.
<P>
       *If data was deleted, the data you pasted or imported doesn't match
       the field data types or the FieldSize property in the destination
       table.
<P>
       *If records were lost, either the records you pasted contain
       primary key values that already exist in the destination table, or
       they violate referential integrity rules for a relationship
       defined between tables. Do you want to proceed anyway?

<P><LI>Click Yes. Note that Microsoft Access does not create an Import Errors
    table.
