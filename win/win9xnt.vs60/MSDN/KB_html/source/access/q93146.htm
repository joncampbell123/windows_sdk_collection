The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When a user (User1) attempts to commit a record in an attached Paradox
table and that record has been changed by another user (User2), User1
sees this error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Data has changed; operation aborted.

</PRE>After User1 chooses the OK button, a second error message appears:
<P>
<PRE>   This record has been changed by another user since you
   began editing it...  Save Record, Copy to Clipboard,
   Drop Changes.

</PRE>If User1 selects the Save Record option, the first error message is
repeated. User1 is caught in a continuous loop, unable to commit the
record.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To save the changes made to the current record, User1 must:

<OL><P><LI>Select the Copy to Clipboard option.

<P><LI>Select the record User1 was attempting to change.

<P><LI>Choose Paste from the Edit menu.

<P><LI>Commit the record.
<P>
</OL>User1 can prevent User2 from changing a record while User1 is editing
it by changing the multiuser option to Edited Records.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Access version
1.0. This problem no longer occurs in Microsoft Access version 1.1.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>

Access.

<OL><P><LI>Both users attach to a Paradox Table.

<P><LI>Both users set their multiuser options to No Locks.

<P><LI>User1 starts to edit a field but does not commit the record.

<P><LI>User2 changes and commits the same record by choosing Save Record from
   the File menu or by moving the cursor to the next record.

<P><LI>User1 attempts to commit the changed record.
<P>
   Error Message #1: Data has changed; operation stopped.
<P>
