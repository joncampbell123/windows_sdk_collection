The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access versions 1.0, 1.1, 2.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
You receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Unable to load communication module.
   Driver has not been properly installed.
   Unable to connect to data source.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When using database servers other than Microsoft SQL Server as the back-
end, this error indicates that the communications module for that driver is
not able to load. Please contact your ODBC driver vendor for more
information.
<P>
If you're using Microsoft SQL Server, the error occurs because the
DBNMP3.DLL file you are using may be old, you may have duplicate DBNMP3.DLL
files on your system and the wrong one is being used, or the DBNMP3.DLL
file you are using may be damaged or corrupted.
<P>
This error can also be caused by an incorrect [SQLSERVER] entry in your
WIN.INI file. This entry should look like:
<P>
<PRE>   [SQLSERVER]
   MY_SERVER=DBNMP3,\\MY_SERVER\PIPE\SQL\QUERY

</PRE>If there are any spaces in the above entry, or if DBNMP3 is misspelled, you
will receive the error.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Access version 1.0, the DBNMP3.DLL file installed by
Microsoft Access version 1.0 is dated 9/15/92, has a size of 8241 bytes.
In Microsoft Access version 1.1, the DBNMP3.DLL file is dated 5/26/93
with a file size of 9941 bytes. In both versions, this file should be
installed in the Windows\SYSTEM directory.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
It is possible that there are other situations that may indirectly cause
the above error message to be displayed. To troubleshoot this problem, do
the following:

<UL><LI>Use File Manager to search for multiple, corrupted, or outdated
   copies of these files:
<P>
<PRE>      Filename     Date              Size
      -----------------------------------

      ODBC.DLL     10/16/92 or later (44736 bytes)
      SQLSRVR.DLL  10/16/92 or later (135792 bytes)
      NETAPI.DLL   depends on the network being used
      COMMDLG.DLL  10/25/92 or later (89248 bytes)

      NOTE: The sizes and dates referenced are correct if the files
      are installed by Microsoft Access version 1.0.

</PRE><LI>Make sure the files listed above are in their appropriate
   locations. All of the files except NETAPI.DLL are usually installed
   in the Windows\SYSTEM subdirectory. The NETAPI.DLL file is a
   network specific driver,usually located in the network's
   program directory. This file should be in the path.

<LI>Use another application, such as Q+E, SAF, or PowerBuilder, on the
   same machine to attempt to attach to the same data source. If you
   cannot access the data source from another application, then it is
   probably a problem with the network, such as NETAPI.DLL, or a
   problem with the server, not with Microsoft Access or ODBC.

<LI>Attempt to attach to another data source, if available, such as
   another SQL server. If you can attach to another server, then the
   original server may be down or you may need to reconfigure the entry
   for that server using the ODBC Administration Utility.

<LI>Attempt to attach to the same data source from another machine. If
   you cannot access the SQL server from another machine, it may
   indicate a network-wide problem or that the server is down or not
   communicating.

<LI>Try increasing your ODBC timeout settings in the ODBC section of
   the MSACCESS.INI file.

<LI>Check with the system administrator to see if the SQL server is up,
   available for transactions, and operating properly.

<LI>Reinstall ODBC after performing a clean boot and renaming the
   ODBC.DLL, DBNMP3.DLL, and SQLSRVR.DLL files.
