The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multiuser skills.
<P>
When you try to run a custom setup program created by using the Microsoft
Office 97 Developer Edition Tools (ODE) Setup Wizard, you may receive the
following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Setup Error 825

     Object 425

   Your Setup files may be damaged. Try restarting the Setup program from
   where you originally ran it.

</PRE>If you click OK, you may receive the same error message several times but
with different object numbers.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior may occur if you have a pre-Microsoft Access 97 version of
your Microsoft Access database and any of its supporting files included in
the ODE Setup Wizard program.
<P>
For example, if you create your disk images from a template that you
created with the Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit for Windows 95
version 7.0, the disk images that the ODE Setup Wizard creates may contain
mismatched files.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Make sure that you do not use templates that you created with a version of
the Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit or that contain mixed versions of
program files or database files. This will prevent mismatched files from
being on the disk images and will prevent setup errors when you run your
custom setup program.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you create your disk images using the Microsoft Access Developer's
Toolkit, certain files are added to the disk images. If you save a template
for that setup program, the setup program tries to add those same files
each time that you create your disk images. If you then try to use this
template with the ODE Setup wizard, it will also try to use those same
files; however, the files that are added to your disk images may not be the
correct files for the version of Microsoft Access that you are using.
<P>
NOTE: This same behavior occurs when you add database or program files from
an earlier version of Microsoft Access to the ODE Setup wizard program.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start the Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition Tools (ODE) Setup
   Wizard.

<P><LI>On the screen that asks "What would you like to do?", select "Use
   previously saved setup options to create a custom Setup program for my
   application."

<P><LI>When the Load Template dialog box opens, select an MDT file that was
   created using the Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit 7.0, and then
   click OK.

<P><LI>Click Next, on all the rest of the Setup Wizard screens to accept the
   default values.

<P><LI>On the screen that enables you to create your disk images, select a
   mode of distribution, and then click Finish.

<P><LI>After the disk images are created, run setup to install your custom
   setup program on any test computer.
<P>
   Note that you receive the error message mentioned in the "Symptoms"
   section.
