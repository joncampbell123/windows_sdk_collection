The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access versions 1.0, 1.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
MS-DOS, Microsoft Windows, and Windows-based applications use
SHARE.EXE to provide a file locking mechanism so that Windows-based
tasks can communicate with each other. The tasks use SHARE.EXE to sort
out file read/write conflicts. Therefore, it is important that you
load SHARE.EXE before starting Windows. Without SHARE.EXE loaded, you
may experience data corruption in applications.
<P>
Using SHARE.EXE with Microsoft Access allows multiple users to access a
database at the same time while protecting them from updating the same
record at the same time. If a database is opened exclusively by one
user, no other users will be able to use the database until the first
user releases it. However, if all users open the database in a shared
mode, SHARE.EXE allows all users to read and write to the database
simultaneously, with the exception of locked records. For example, if
a user has record 100 open on a particular database, that record is
considered locked, and no other users will be able to change any data
in record 100 until the first user finishes changing it.
<P>
For this reason, while it is possible to run Microsoft Access without
first loading SHARE.EXE, Microsoft does not recommend it. If you choose
not to use SHARE.EXE, you must ensure that only one Windows-based task
writes to a database record at any given moment.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
MS-DOS uses SHARE.EXE to lock files as requested by applications.
SHARE.EXE controls updates and prevents data corruption in files.
<P>
An application can request a deny-read lock (exclusive), a deny-write
lock, or both. Deny-write locks allow other applications to read data,
but prevent two different applications from updating the same file at
the same time.
<P>
SHARE.EXE also provides byte-range locks. When a range of bytes is
locked, other applications cannot read, write, or lock those bytes.
Other, unlocked bytes, in the file are not affected. An application
can use byte-range locks to place exclusive locks on records for
record-level locking.
<P>
In single-user environments, SHARE.EXE prevents file contention
accidents when multiple instances of a program attempt to write to the
same database or database record at the same time. In multiple-user
environments such as networks, SHARE.EXE prevents possible database
corruption when several different network users attempt to write to
the same database or database record at the same time.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups</h3>
 
<P>
The only time you do not have to use SHARE.EXE is when you run
Microsoft Windows for Workgroups in Enhanced mode. Microsoft Windows
for Workgroups in Enhanced mode loads and uses a file-sharing program
called VSHARE.386, which is a replacement for SHARE.EXE. There is an
entry for VSHARE.386 in the SYSTEM.INI file.
<P>
If you plan on running Windows for Workgroups exclusively in Enhanced
mode and do not run other applications that require SHARE.EXE, you can
save approximately 5K of conventional memory by not loading SHARE.EXE. To
do this, remove the SHARE.EXE line from your AUTOEXEC.BAT file and
restart your computer.
<P>
SHARE.EXE is likely to be in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file because during the
Microsoft Access installation process, the SETUP.EXE program
automatically inserts the following MS-DOS command in your AUTOEXEC.BAT
file:
<P>
<PRE>   &lt;MS-DOS directory&gt;\SHARE.EXE /L:500

</PRE>If SHARE.EXE is already present before running Microsoft Windows for
Workgroups in Enhanced mode, VSHARE.386 loads in addition to SHARE.EXE,
temporarily disabling SHARE.EXE. Then VSHARE.386 takes over file sharing
tasks until you exit Microsoft Windows for Workgroups. After you exit
Windows for Workgroups, VSHARE.386 passes file-sharing control back to
SHARE.EXE for use by MS-DOS applications that require it.
<P>
Microsoft Access runs correctly with either SHARE.EXE or VSHARE.386,
but SHARE.EXE limits the number of available locks to the number
specified when SHARE.EXE was loaded. The /L parameter specifies the
number of share locks; the default is 20. VSHARE.386, on the other
hand, dynamically allocates the number of locks available based on the
demand for locks. The number of locks available is especially
important if the computer running Microsoft Windows for Workgroups
acts as a server in a client-server environment.
