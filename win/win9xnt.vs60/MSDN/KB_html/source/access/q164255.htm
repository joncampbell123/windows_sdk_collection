<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Novice: Requires knowledge of the user interface on single-user computers.
<P>
The stand-alone version of Microsoft Access 97 comes with a registration
card that has incorrect information for the Standard Support offerings.
The registration card states the following:
<P>
<PRE>   Unlimited no-charge support, via a toll call, is available from
   Microsoft support engineers. The Standard support telephone number is
   located at the bottom of this card. Please have your Product
   identification number available when you call. In the United States,
   hours are 6AM. - 6PM. Pacific time. In Canada, hours are 8 AM. - 8PM.
   eastern time. Both are Monday-Friday, excluding holidays.

</PRE>This is a documentation error. The no-charge support is not unlimited. The
standard support that is offered for Microsoft Access allows two no-charge
incidents only.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The correct offerings for standard support can be found in the PSS8.hlp
file that comes with Microsoft Office 97 and Microsoft Access 97. This
file can be found in your \Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office folder.
The PSS8.hlp file contains the following information for Standard Support
offerings.
<P>
<P><h3>Standard support</h3>
 
<P>
In the United States, Microsoft offers unlimited no-charge usability
support via toll call for the Microsoft Office Standard Edition. Microsoft
also offers two (2) no-charge incidents for assistance developing custom
solutions and applications using the Microsoft Office Standard Edition. The
Microsoft Office Professional Edition (which includes Microsoft Access)
comes with two (2) additional incidents, for a total of four (4) incidents,
which can be used for Microsoft Access usability questions or for
developing custom solutions using the Microsoft Office Professional
Edition. Standard Support hours are 6:00 A.M. and 6:00 P.M. Pacific time,
Monday through Friday, excluding holidays.

Technical Support, and Service Advantage is available on the Microsoft
