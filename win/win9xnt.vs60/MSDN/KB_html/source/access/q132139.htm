The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access versions 2.0, 7.0, 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you share a database in Microsoft Access and try to update a record
that another user has already updated, your update is not successful, and
you receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Data has changed; Operation stopped.

</PRE>After you click the OK button, you receive the following write-conflict
error message:
<P>
<PRE>   This record has been changed by another user since you started
   editing it. If you save the record, you will overwrite the
   changes the other user made.

   Copying the changes to the clipboard will let you look at
   the values the other user entered, and then paste your changes
   back in if you decide to make changes.

   You can choose one of three option buttons:

      Save Record
      Copy To Clipboard
      Drop Changes

</PRE>If you choose Save Record, Microsoft Access does not update the record, and
you receive the following referential integrity error message:
<P>
<PRE>   In Microsoft Access 97:

    The Record cannot be deleted or changed because table '&lt;Table Name&gt;'
    includes related records.

   In Microsoft Access 2.0 and 7.0:

    Can't delete or change record. Since related records exist in table
    "&lt;Table Name&gt;", referential integrity rules would be violated.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
You have a one-to-many relationship between your tables where the Enforce
Referential Integrity option is turned on and the Cascade Update Related
Fields option is turned off.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, modify the one-to-many relationship to select
the Cascade Update Related Fields option.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Access version
2.0, 7.0, and 97. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 
<P>
NOTE: Make sure that the Exclusive option is not selected in the File
Open dialog box.

<OL><P><LI>Open two instances of Microsoft Access. In each instance, open the
   sample database Northwind.mdb (or NWIND.MDB in Microsoft Access 2.0)
   for shared access.

<P><LI>In each instance, open the Categories table in Datasheet view.

<P><LI>In the first instance, change the Description field in the first
   record. Do not commit the change.

<P><LI>In the second instance, change the Description field in the first
   record. Commit the change by moving the pointer to the next record.

<P><LI>Switch to the first instance and try to commit the change. You receive
   the following error message:
<P>
<P><PRE>      This record has been changed by another user since you started
      editing it. If you save the record, you will overwrite the
      changes the other user made.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Click Save Record. Note that you receive the following error message:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Can't delete or change record. Since related records exist in table
      "&lt;Table Name&gt;", referential integrity rules would be violated.
