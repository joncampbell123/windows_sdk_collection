The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multiuser skills.
<P>
During the Current event of a form, there is a one-record difference
between the values displayed in the chart on the form and the values
contained in the datasheet of the chart. The datasheet's values reflect
data from the previous record, not the current record. This behavior also
occurs during the Format or Print event of the detail section of a report.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The chart itself displays the correct values because Microsoft Access
populates it directly from its row source, which is a SQL statement or a
saved query. During the Current, Format, and Print events, the data sheet
of the chart does not yet contain the data from the row source that appears
in the chart itself.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
If you need to modify a chart characteristic that depends on the data in
the current record or on any state produced by an OnCurrent, OnFormat, or
OnPrint procedure, you must clear the datasheet of the chart and repopulate
it. The following example uses a Visual Basic for Applications procedure to
clear and repopulate the datasheet of a chart during the Current event of
the form.

<OL><P><LI>Follow steps 1 - 19 in the "Steps to Reproduce Behavior" section later
   in this article.

<P><LI>Set the OnCurrent property of the form to the following event procedure:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Private Sub Form_Current()
<PRE></PRE>         Dim chtObj As Object, strRowSource As String
         Dim rsRowSourceFiltered As Recordset

         Dim i As Integer, j As Integer
         Set chtObj = Me!chtSync.Object
         intMaxShippers = 3

         ' In the chart's RowSource, insert a WHERE
         ' clause based on the value of the form
         ' field contained in the chart control's
         ' LinkMasterFields property.
         strRowSource = Left(Me!chtSync.RowSource, _
            InStr(Me!chtSync.RowSource, "GROUP BY") - 1) _

         If rsRowSourceFiltered.BOF And _
               rsRowSourceFiltered.EOF Then
            MsgBox "There are no records to chart."
            Exit Sub
         End If

         ' Clear the rows required for the maximum number of
         ' data rows. The first row contains the column
         ' headers. Data rows begin at the second row.

<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 
<P>
CAUTION: Following the steps in this example will modify the sample
database Northwind.mdb. You may want to back up the Northwind.mdb file
and perform these steps on a copy of the database.
<P>
<PRE>  1. Open the Product Sales for 1995 query in the sample database
     Northwind.mdb.

  2. Add the Shippers table to the query. Microsoft Access automatically
     creates a join between the ShipVia field in the Orders table and the
     ShipperID field in the Shippers table.

  3. Drag the CompanyName field from the Shippers table to the first empty
     column on the query design grid. Leave the Total row for this field
     set to the default value of Group By.

  4. Save and close the query.

  5. Create a new form based on the Categories table. Include only the
     CategoryID and CategoryName fields in the detail section of the form.

  6. On the Insert menu, click Chart to create a chart in the detail
     section of the form.

  7. On the first screen of the Chart Wizard, click Queries and select
     Product Sales for 1995. Click Next.

  8. Move the CompanyName field from the Available Fields list to the
     Fields For Chart list. Then move the ProductSales field from the
     Available Fields list to the Fields For Chart list. Click Next.

  9. Click Next in the chart type screen to select the default type of
     Column Chart.

 10. On the layout screen of the Chart Wizard, click Next.

 11. Click OK if you receive the following message:

       You must add field CategoryID if you want to use this link.

 12. In the Form Fields list, click CategoryName; in the Chart Fields list,
     click CategoryName, and then click Finish.

 13. On the View menu, click Properties and change the Name property of the
     chart to "chtSync" (without the quotation marks).

 14. Save the form as frmChartSync.

 15. On the Edit menu, click Select Form. On the View menu, click
     Properties, and then click the Event tab.

 16. Click the OnCurrent property box, and then click the Build (...)
     button.

 17. In the Choose Builder dialog box, click Code Builder. Click OK to
     display the Form_frmChartSync class module.

 18. On the Tools menu, click References.

 19. In the References dialog box, scroll down the Available References
     list and select the Microsoft Graph 8.0 Object Library. Click OK.

 20. Set the OnCurrent property of the form to the following event
     procedure:

       Private Sub Form_Current()
          Dim i As Integer
          With Me!chtSync.Object.Application
             ' Each datasheet row contains two columns for the
             ' shipper's CompanyName and SumProductSales. The first
             ' row contains the column headers.
             Debug.Print "*** OnCurrent Values ***"
             For i = 1 To 4
                Debug.Print .DataSheet.Cells(i, 1).Value &amp; _
                   " - " &amp; .DataSheet.Cells(i, 2).Value
             Next
          End With
       End Sub

 21. Close the module and insert a command button on the form.

 22. View the property sheet of the command button and change the Name
     property to "cmdGraphData" (without the quotation marks) and the
     Caption property to "Current Graph Data" (without the quotation
     marks).

 23. Click the OnCurrent property box, and then click the Build (...)
     button.

 24. In the Choose Builder dialog box, click Code Builder. Click OK to
     display the Form_frmChartSync class module.

 25. Set the OnClick property of cmdGraphData to the following event
     procedure:

       Private Sub cmdGraphData_Click()
          Dim i As Integer
          With Me!chtSync.Object.Application
             ' Note that this code is the same as
             ' that in the Current event procedure.
             Debug.Print "*** Form View Values ***"
             For i = 1 To 4
                Debug.Print .DataSheet.Cells(i, 1).Value &amp; _
                   " - " &amp; .DataSheet.Cells(i, 2).Value
             Next
          End With
       End Sub

 26. Save the form and switch to Form view.

 27. Press CTRL+G to display the Debug window. Note that the Debug window
     displays the East, West, and North values that correspond to the
     sample data instead of the actual values that correspond to the
     current record on the form.

 28. Go to the next record. Note that the Debug window now displays
     Shippers data, but it does not match the data displayed in the chart
     on the form. The data in the Debug window corresponds to the previous
     record.

 29. Click Current Graph Data. Note that the chart data displayed in the
     Debug Window now matches that of the current record.
