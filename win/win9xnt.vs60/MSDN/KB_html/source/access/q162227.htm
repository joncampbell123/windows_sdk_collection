The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Novice: Requires knowledge of the user interface on single-user computers.
<P>
When you click on a Tab control in Design view of a form, you do not see
the control handles (boxes around the control) that enable you to change
the size of the control or delete the control.
<P>
This article demonstrates how to select pages on the Tab control, and how
to select the entire Tab control in Design view of a form.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following steps demonstrate how to select different portions of a Tab
control. Each page on a Tab control, as well as the control itself, has a
different set of properties that you can customize.

<OL><P><LI>Open the sample database Northwind.mdb.

<P><LI>Click the Forms tab in the Database window.

<P><LI>Click the New button to create a new form.

<P><LI>In the New Form dialog box, select Design View, and then click OK. A
    new form opens in Design view.

<P><LI>On the View menu, click Properties to display the form's Property sheet
    (if it is not already showing). Move the Property sheet on the screen
    so you can see it and the Detail section of the form at the same time.

<P><LI>On the Toolbox toolbar, click the Tab Control button.

<P><LI>Click anywhere in the Detail section of the form. Note that a Tab
    control containing two pages appears on the form and that the title
    bar of the Property sheet displays Tab Control: TabCtl0. Also note the
    position of the control handles around the control. This is how the
    control appears when the entire Tab control is selected.

<P><LI>Click anywhere in the blank area of the Detail section of the form so
    that the Tab control no longer has focus.

<P><LI>Click in the center of the Tab control. Note that no part of the Tab
    control is selected, and that the title bar of the Property sheet
    displays Section: Detail.

<P><LI>Click on the Page1 tab of the Tab control and note that the control
    handles only appear around the page itself, and not around the entire
    control. Note also that the title bar of the Property sheet
    displays Page: Page1. Repeat this for the Page2 tab and note the
    similarities.

<P><LI>Click the blank area to the right of the Page2 tab, or click on the
    top, bottom, left or right border of the Tab control. Note that the
    control handles appear around the entire Tab control, and that the
    title bar of the Property sheet once again displays Tab Control:
    TabCtl0.
