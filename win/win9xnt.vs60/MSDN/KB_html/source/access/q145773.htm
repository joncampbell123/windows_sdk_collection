The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access versions 7.0, 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
When you carry out a SendKeys macro action, you may receive the following
error message:
<P>
<PRE>   The SendKeys action requires the Microsoft Access Utility Add-in
   to be loaded.

   Solution
   Run Setup to reinstall Microsoft Access and the Microsoft Access
   Utility Add-in.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Keystrokes argument of the SendKeys action has incorrect syntax. For
example, you may have enclosed the Keystrokes argument in quotation
marks ("), entered incorrect syntax, or misspelled some text.
<P>
If you receive the error message after converting a database created in an
earlier version of Microsoft Access, the specified keystrokes may not work
in Microsoft Access 7.0. or 97. Or, the Keystrokes argument may have been
enclosed in quotation marks which was not required in earlier versions but
was permitted. In Microsoft Access 7.0 and 97, however, you cannot enclose
the Keystrokes argument of a SendKeys macro action in quotation marks.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Open the macro in Design view and fix the Keystrokes argument as necessary.
For example, remove any quotation marks, correct a misspelling, or fix any
syntax errors.
<P>
NOTE: If you want to include a quotation mark as one of the keystrokes used
by the SendKeys macro action, you need to enter two sets of quotation marks
in the Keystrokes argument, as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   Macro1
   --------------------------------------------------------------
   SendKeys
      Keystrokes: ""Building Applications with Microsoft Access""
      Wait: No

   -or-

   Macro2
   --------------------------------------
   SendKeys
      Keystrokes: Michael ""Mick"" Suyama
      Wait: No

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
NOTE: If you use a SendKeys action to carry out menu commands or fill-in
dialog boxes, you may want to find an alternative method for the action.
The SendKeys' keystrokes may not work in future versions of Microsoft
Access because the user interface may change. Depending on your purpose for
using SendKeys, you may want to try one of the following methods:

<UL><LI>If you want to set a field to a specific value, try using a SetValue
   action in a macro or set it directly in Visual Basic. For more
   information about the SetValue macro action, search the Help Index for
   "SetValue action," or ask the Microsoft Access 97 Office Assistant.

<LI>If you want to carry out a menu command, try using a RunCommand action
   or a RunCommand method (or a DoMenuItem action or a DoMenuItem method in
   Microsoft Access 7.0), in Visual Basic for Applications. For more
   information about the RunCommand macro action, search the Help Index for
   "RunCommand Action." For more information about the DoMenuItem macro
   action, search the Help Index for "DoMenuItem action."
<P>
   NOTE: In Microsoft Access 97, the DoMenuItem method and the DoMenuItem
   action have been replaced by the RunCommand method and the RunCommand
   action. They are included in Microsoft Access 97 for compatibility with
   earlier versions.

<LI>If you want to fill in dialog boxes, try running the equivalent method
   in Visual Basic (if one exists) and setting any arguments that
   correspond to the dialog box options.

<LI>If you want to activate another application from Microsoft Access, try
   using Automation or dynamic data exchange (DDE) (if supported by the
   other program). For more information about Automation (or DDE),
   search the Help Index for "OLE" or "DDE," and then view the available
   topics.
<P>
</UL><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 
<P>
CAUTION: Following the steps in this example will modify the sample
database Northwind.mdb. You may want to back up the Northwind.mdb file or
perform these steps on a copy of the Northwind database.

<OL><P><LI>Open the sample database Northwind.mdb.

<P><LI>Create a new macro as follows:
<P>
<PRE>      Macro Name   Macro Action
      -------------------------
      FillField    GotoControl
                   SendKeys

      FillField Actions
      -------------------------------
      GotoControl
         ControlName: Text0
      SendKeys
         Keystrokes: "Sample text for SendKeys."
         Wait: No

</PRE><P><LI>Close the macro and save it as FillField.

<P><LI>Create a form not based on any table or query in Design view.

<P><LI>Add the following two controls to the form:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Form: Form1
      -----------------------
      Text box:
<PRE></PRE>         Name: Text0
         Width: 3 in.
      Command button:
         Name: Button0
         Caption: Fill Field

</PRE><P><LI>Set the command button's OnClick property to the FillField macro.

<P><LI>View the form in Form view.

<P><LI>Click the Fill Field button. Note that you receive the error message
   mentioned in the "Symptoms" section.
