The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access version 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Novice: Requires knowledge of the user interface on single-user computers.
<P>
In Microsoft Access version 7.0, you may receive the following error
message while developing, over time, an application with code, for example,
when you work on a form containing event procedures or when you start the
application:
<P>
<PRE>   This application has performed an illegal operation and will be shut
   down.

</PRE>If you click the Details button, you see the following information:
<P>
<PRE>   Msaccess.exe caused an invalid page fault in module VBA232.DLL.

</PRE>NOTE: This error can also occur when you print a code module in Far East
versions of Microsoft Access, which contains DBSC (double-byte character
set) characters.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This error message has three possible causes:

<UL><LI>A confirmed bug in the Visual Basic for Applications Development
   Environment (VBA232.dll version 2.0.5524)

<LI>A damaged database

<LI>Mismatched dynamic link libraries (.dll files) in the \Windows\System
   folder as a result of installing Microsoft Office Standard for Windows
   95 or Microsoft Office Professional for Windows 95 before Microsoft
   Access 7.0
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
You can resolve this error message by trying the following steps. If you
try these in order, you can stop at whichever step eliminates the problem
and skip the remaining steps:

<OL><P><LI>Install the update to Vba232.dll. For more information about this
   update and how to obtain it, please see the following article in the
   Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../access/q147529.htm">Q147529</A></B>
<PRE></PRE>      TITLE     : ACC95: Updated Vba232.dll Available on MSL

</PRE><P><LI>Run the Compact Database and Repair Database commands. Whenever you
   receive an invalid page fault error message, you should run these
   commands on the current database to correct any potential damage to the
   database's structure or data.
<P>
   NOTE: The Compact Database command should be run on a regular basis (for
   example, nightly). The Repair Database command should ONLY be run if the
   Microsoft Jet database engine returns an error message indicating that
   the Repair should be run. Before you run the Repair Database command,
   you should make a backup copy of the database.

<P><LI>Rename the current database file and try to open it again. When you
   assign a new name, you can assign either a long file name or an MS-DOS
   8.3 file name (that is, an 8-character name followed by a 3-character
   extension).

<P><LI>Create a new database, import all of the objects from the original
   database to the new database, open a module window within the new
   database, click Compile All Modules on the Run menu, and click Save All
   Modules on the File menu.

<P><LI>If none of the above steps solves the error message, then the cause is
   most likely mismatched .dll files on your system. You should uninstall
   both Microsoft Office for Windows 95 (Standard or Professional) and
   Microsoft Access 7.0 and reinstall them. For specific details about how
   to uninstall and reinstall these applications, please see the following
   article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../access/q148424.htm">Q148424</A></B>
<PRE></PRE>      TITLE     : ACC: Troubleshooting Invalid Page Faults in MS Access 95
                  and 97

   NOTE: Be sure to install Microsoft Access first and Microsoft Office
   second when you reinstall the two programs. This setup order is
   important to avoid the problem of mismatched .dll files on your system.
   Also, because the uninstall process may remove Vba232.dll, you should
   repeat step 1 to make sure you have the latest version of Vba232.dll.

</PRE></OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Access
version 7.0. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
