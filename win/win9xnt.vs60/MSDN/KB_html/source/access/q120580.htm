The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access version 2.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multiuser skills.
<P>
After you log on to Microsoft Access as any user other than the Admin user,
you receive the following error message when you try to open the sample
database DBSTRUCT.MDB:
<P>
<PRE>   No permission for '&lt;path&gt;\DBSTRUCT.MDB'

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Only the Admin user has Open/Run permission on the DBSTRUCT database.
Neither the Admins group nor the Users group has Open/Run permission on
the database.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
You can use the DBSTRUCT database by logging on to Microsoft Access using a
new, unsecured system database (or SYSTEM.MDA file), or you can modify the
DBSTRUCT database's permissions so that other users can open it. Both of
these methods are demonstrated below.
<P>
<P><h3>How to Use a New, Unsecured System Database</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Quit Microsoft Access if it is running, and then make a backup copy
   of the SYSTEM.MDA file. Name the backup copy of the file SYSTEM.BAK.

<P><LI>Double-click the MS Access Workgroup Administrator icon in your
   Microsoft Access program group. (NOTE: This icon may be in another
   group, such as the Microsoft Office program group.)

<P><LI>In the Workgroup Administrator dialog box, choose the Create button to
   create a new system database.

<P><LI>In the Workgroup Owner Information dialog box, type appropriate
   information in the Name, Organization, and Workgroup ID boxes, and
   then choose the OK button.

<P><LI>In the Workgroup System Database dialog box, enter a path and unique
   name for the new system database file in the Database box, and then
   choose OK. For example, enter:
<P>
<P><PRE>      C:\ACCESS\UNSECURE.MDA
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: Do not use the same name as your secure system database file
   because Microsoft Access will attempt to overwrite the file when
   it creates the new file. Also, the path in the example above is for
   illustrative purposes only; you should use the correct path for your
   Microsoft Access installation.

<P><LI>In the Confirm Workgroup Information dialog box, choose OK. When
   you receive a message stating that the new system database was
   created, choose OK.

<P><LI>Choose the Exit button to quit the Workgroup Administrator.

<P><LI>Start Microsoft Access. You should not receive a Logon dialog box,
   which means that you are logging on to Microsoft Access as the default
   Admin user. Since the Admin user has Open/Run permission on the
   DBSTRUCT database, you should now be able to open the database.
<P>
</OL><h3>How to Modify Permissions on the DBSTRUCT Database</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start Microsoft Access and log on as the Admin user.

<P><LI>Open the sample database DBSTRUCT.MDB.

<P><LI>From the Security menu, choose Permissions.

<P><LI>In the Object Type box, select Database.

<P><LI>Select the Groups option button, and then select the Users group in
    the User/Group Name box.

<P><LI>In the Permissions group, select the Open/Run check box, and then
    choose the Assign button.

<P><LI>In the User/Group Name box, select the Admins group.

<P><LI>In the Permissions group, select the Open/Run check box, and then
    choose the Assign button.

<P><LI>Choose the Close button, and then quit Microsoft Access.

<P><LI>Restart Microsoft Access and log on as you normally do. You should
    now be able to open the DBSTRUCT database.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Access version
2.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>In an unsecured Microsoft Access system, create a new user named USER1
   and add the user to the Admins group.

<P><LI>Assign a password to the default Admin user so that you will receive
   a Logon dialog box when you restart Microsoft Access.

<P><LI>Quit and then restart Microsoft Access. Log on to Microsoft Access as
   USER1.

<P><LI>Try to open the DBSTRUCT database. Since USER1 does not have Open/Run
   permission on the database, you will receive the error message stated
   above.
