<UL><LI>Microsoft Access versions 7.0, 97

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Database Replication is a feature of the Microsoft Jet database engine 3.0
and later that enables you to make special copies of databases (called
replicas) so that users can work on their own copies at different
locations. At a later time, users can synchronize their copies to ensure
that they have consistent, up-to-date records and objects. When you
replicate a database, your original database becomes the Design Master for
the replica set.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To implement Microsoft Jet database engine replication, you need to convert
a Microsoft Access database into a special replicable format. There are
three ways to make a database replicable:

<UL><LI>You can drag and drop the database file (.mdb) into the Briefcase on the
   Windows 95 or Windows NT 4.0 desktop.

<LI>You can use the Create Replica command in Microsoft Access. (Point to
   Replication on the Tools menu and click Create Replica.)

<LI>You can use the Replication Manager available with the Microsoft Office
   97, Developer Edition or the Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit
   for Windows 95 version 7.0.
<P>
</UL>When you convert a database into a replicable format, you are asked to make
a backup copy of the database. You should click Yes to create the backup
copy because you cannot return the database to its non-replicated state
once it is replicable.
<P>
The replication conversion process adds several components, modifies a few
properties for existing objects, and adds new properties to a database.
Specifically, replication makes the following changes to a database:

<UL><LI>A minimum of three new fields are added to each data table:
<P>
<P><PRE>    1. The s_GUID field stores a globally unique identifier for each
       record.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    2. The s_Lineage field stores binary information about the history of
       changes to the record.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    3. The s_Generation field stores information about groups of changes.
       If a table has Memo or OLE data type fields, multiple s_Generation
       fields are added--one for each Memo or OLE field.
</PRE>
<LI>Several System tables are added to the database to record the history
   of exchanges between replicas, the location of other replicas in the
   replica set, and other information required by the Microsoft Jet
   database engine.

<LI>The NewValues property of AutoNumber fields will change from Increment
   to Random. This prevents any new records from receiving the same value
   as other new records in different replicas.

<LI>The Properties collection in data access objects (DAO) has five
   additional properties: DesignMasterID, KeepLocal, Replicable, ReplicaID,
   and ReplicationConflictFunction.

<LI>The Replicable property for each object in the database is set to "T".

For more information about creating replicas, search the Help Index for
"replicas, creating," or ask the Microsoft Access 97 Office Assistant.

For more information about changes made to your database when it is
replicated, search the Help Index for "replicas, changes to fields and
tables," or ask the Microsoft Access 97 Office Assistant.
