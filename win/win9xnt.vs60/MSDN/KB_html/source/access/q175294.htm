The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
When you export a Microsoft Access form to ASP format and then view the
result in a browser, you receive the following message:
<P>
<PRE>   An ActiveX object on this page may be unsafe. Do you
   want to allow it to initialize and be accessed by scripts?

</PRE>You also receive this message each time you move to another record.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The prompt appears because you are using the HTML Layout Control with
Microsoft Internet Explorer version 4.0. The HTML Layout Control processes
the ActiveX Layout file associated with a form that has been exported to
ASP format; the name of this file is in the format &lt;formname&gt;alx.asp.
<P>
This behavior is the result of enhancements that have been made to
Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0, and it does not occur if you are using
Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.x.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To avoid being prompted when you open an ASP file and move to other
records, add the server that contains the ASP file to the Trusted sites
zone. Then change the security for the Trusted sites zone to enable
initialization and scripting of ActiveX controls not marked as safe.
<P>
WARNING: You should consider any security implications before implementing
this resolution.

<OL><P><LI>Start Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0.

<P><LI>On the View menu, click Internet Options, and then click the Security
   tab.

<P><LI>In the Zone box, select Trusted Sites Zone, and then click Add Sites.

<P><LI>In the Trusted sites zone dialog box, type the name of the server on
   which the ASP file is located in the text box under "Add this Web site
   to the zone." If you require server verification for all sites in this
   zone, type "https://&lt;servername&gt;" (without the quotation marks);
   otherwise, type "<B>http://&lt;servername&gt;</B>" and click to clear the Require
   Server Verification check box.

<P><LI>Click Add, and then click OK.

<P><LI>On the Security tab in the Internet Options dialog box, click Custom,
   and then click Settings.

<P><LI>In the Security Settings dialog box, change the setting for "Initialize
   and script ActiveX controls not marked as safe" from Prompt to Enable,
   and then click OK.

<P><LI>In the Internet Options dialog box, click OK. Note that you can now open
   ASP files in Internet Explorer 4.0 and move to different records
   without receiving a prompt.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create a System DSN on your Web server that points to the Northwind
   sample database. For more information about creating a System DSN,
   please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../access/q159682.htm">Q159682</A></B>
<PRE></PRE>      TITLE     : ACC97: "Data Source Name Not Found" Err Msg Opening Web
                  Page

</PRE><P><LI>Start Microsoft Access 97, and open the sample database Northwind.mdb.

<P><LI>Select the Customers form in the Database window, and on the File menu,
   click Save As/Export.

<P><LI>In the Save As dialog box, click "To an External File or Database," and
   then click OK.

<P><LI>In the "Save Form 'Customers' In" dialog box, select Microsoft Active
   Server Pages (*.asp) in the Save As Type box, and type Customers.asp in
   the File Name Box. Select a folder in which to store the ASP files, and
   then click Export; this folder must have WWW Execute permissions.

<P><LI>In the "Microsoft Active Server Pages Output Options" dialog box, type
   the name of the System DSN you created in step 1 in the Data Source Name
   box.

<P><LI>In the Server URL box, type the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) that
   points to the Web Server location where your ASP files have been saved,
   and then click OK.
<P>
   For example, if you store the ASP files in the \Scripts folder on the
   \\PubTest server, type "<B>http://pubtest/scripts/</B>" (without the
   quotation marks) as your Server URL. Microsoft Access creates the
   files Customers.asp and Customersalx.asp.

<P><LI>Start Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0.

<P><LI>Type the URL in the address box to view Customers.asp.
<P>
   For example, if you saved the ASP file in the Scripts folder located in
   the wwwroot folder of your Web Server, type:
<P>
<PRE>        <B>http://&lt;servername&gt;/Scripts/Customers.asp</B>

   The URL depends upon where your files are located on the Web server.

   Note that you receive the prompt described in the "Symptoms" section
   when you open the ASP file the Internet Explorer 4.0.
