<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Novice: Requires knowledge of the user interface on single-user computers.
<P>
In the Print Preview window in reports, you can move forward and backward
page by page to view your report before printing it. When previewing a
large report, you may notice that it takes longer to move backward than it
takes to move forward. The further along you are in the report preview, the
longer it takes to move backward.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Access must reformat the report pages behind it when moving
backward. In other words, it reformats all the pages from page 1 to the
current page minus 1.
<P>
As you preview a report in the Print Preview window, Microsoft Access
formats the report pages. It keeps the page formats in memory until you
move to a new page. Once you move past a page, all the formats that were
constructed to show that page are lost. Therefore, previous pages must be
reconstructed each time you move backward.
<P>
The more pages there are between page 1 and your current page location, the
more time it takes Microsoft Access to reconstruct them. For example, it
takes less time to go from page 3 to page 2 than it takes to go from page
300 to page 299. In the first example, only two pages need to be
reformatted. In the second, 299 pages need to be reformatted.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
