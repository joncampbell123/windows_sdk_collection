The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
When you use Filter By Selection or Filter By Form commands on a form that
has its DataEntry property set to Yes, Microsoft Access changes the
property setting to No so that it can display the filtered records.
<P>
This behavior is the same for both main forms and subforms.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Access sets the DataEntry property of the form to False so that
it can display the filtered records.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
If you want to use your form only for data entry, you can do one of the
following:

<UL><LI>Use custom menus and toolbars with your form so that users cannot
   carry out the Filter By Form or Filter By Selection commands. This is
   the recommended method.

<LI>Use Visual Basic code or a macro in the Current event of the form to
   reset the DataEntry property to True. While this method does work, it
   can slow down performance of your form when users click the Filter By
   Form or Filter By Selection commands.
<P>
</UL>You can find information, instructions, and examples in the Developer
Solutions sample application (Solutions.mdb) included with Microsoft
Access 97. For more information about creating a custom menu for a form,
open the Solutions.mdb database, usually located in the Access\Samples
folder. Select Sample Forms in the "Select a Category of Examples" box,
and then EditProducts in the Select An Example box.
<P>
For more information about setting form properties in the Current event,
search the Help Index for "OnCurrent property" or "properties, events."
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start Microsoft Access and open the sample database Northwind.mdb.

<P><LI>Using the Autoform: Columnar Wizard, create a new form based on the
   Customers table.

<P><LI>Switch to Design view and set the following properties of the form:
<P>
<P><PRE>      AllowEdits: No
      AllowDeletions: No
      AllowAdditions: Yes
      DataEntry: Yes
</PRE>
<P><LI>Save the form as AddCustomer, and then switch to Form view.

<P><LI>On the Records menu, point to Filter, and then click Filter By Form.

<P><LI>Select WA in the Region field.

<P><LI>On the Filter menu, click Apply Filter/Sort. Note that the form
   displays existing records.

<P><LI>Press CTRL+G to open the Debug window.

<P><LI>Type the following line in the Debug window, and then press ENTER:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ?Forms!AddCustomer.DataEntry
</PRE><P>
   Note that the value of the DataEntry property is False.
