The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access version 2.0, 7.0, 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multiuser skills.
<P>
You may need to create a database in which some users have the ability to
add other users, but don't have the ability to view the design of objects
in the database. You can accomplish this by setting the ownership of
different objects, and then shipping your application together with a
different system database than the one that was used to create it. The
system database is usually the System.mdw (or SYSTEM.MDA in version 2.0).
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following example demonstrates how to make a user named Mary able to
create new user accounts but unable to view the design of existing objects
in the database:

<OL><P><LI>Quit Microsoft Access if it is running, and then make a backup copy
<P><PRE>    of your System.mdw file (or SYSTEM.MDA in version 2.0).
</PRE>
<P><LI>Using the Workgroup Administrator program, create and join a new
   workgroup. Make note of the Name, Organization, and Workgroup ID values
   used to create the new workgroup. These values are combined to create
   the group Security ID (SID) for the Admins group.

<P><LI>Start Microsoft Access, open any database, and
<P>
   In Microsoft Access 7.0 and 97:
<P>
<P><PRE>    a. On the Tools menu, click Security and then click User and Group
       Accounts. In the User and Group Accounts dialog box click the Change
       Logon Password tab. Assign a password for the Admin user.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    b. On the Tools menu, click Security, and then click User and Group
       Accounts. On the Users tab, click New, and then create a new user
       called Developer. Make note of the Personal ID that you assign for
       the new user. Make the Developer user a member of the Admins group.
</PRE><P>
   In Microsoft Access 2.0
<P>
<P><PRE>    a. On the Security menu, click Change Password. Assign a password for
       the Admin user.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    b. On the Security menu, click Users. Click New, and then create a new
       user called Developer. Make note of the Personal ID that you assign
       for the new user. Make the Developer user a member of the Admins
       group.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Quit and then restart Microsoft Access. Log on to Microsoft Access as
   the Developer user.

<P><LI>Create a new database called Mydb.mdb. Create a new module in the data-
   base, and then enter the following function in the module:
<P>
<P><PRE>       Function TestSecurity ()
<PRE></PRE>          MsgBox "This is a test of Security"
       End Function

   Save the module as TestModule. Because you are logged on as Developer,
   the owner of this new module will be the Developer user.

</PRE><P><LI>Remove all permissions on the TestModule module from the Users and
   Admins groups. Make sure that only the Developer user has any
   permissions on the TestModule module.

<P><LI>Quit Microsoft Access, and then use the Workgroup Administrator program
   to create and join a new workgroup. Make sure to use a different
   Workgroup ID than you did when you created the workgroup in step 2. If
   you do not, the module you created in step 5 will not be secure.

<P><LI>Start Microsoft Access and open the Mydb.mdb database.

<P><LI>Re-create the user named Developer that you created in step 3b. Make
   sure to use the same Personal ID that you used in step 3b. Make the
   Developer user a member of the Admins group.

<P><LI>Create a new user called Mary. Make Mary a member of the Admins
<P><PRE>    group. Because Mary was not a member of the Admins group in the
    system database in use when the database was created, Mary will not
    have privileges on objects that already exist in the database.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Assign a password for the Admin user as per step 3a above.

<P><LI>Quit and then restart Microsoft Access. Log on to Microsoft Access
<P><PRE>    as Mary and then open the Mydb.mdb database. Note that although Mary
    is a member of the Admins group, and can create new users, Mary has
    no permissions on the TestModule module.
</PRE>
<P><LI>To test the security, quit and then restart Microsoft Access. Log on
<P><PRE>    to Microsoft Access as Developer, and note that you have permissions
    on the TestModule module.
</PRE><P>
