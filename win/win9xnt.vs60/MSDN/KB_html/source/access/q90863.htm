The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access versions 1.0 and 1.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Shared dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) in your system older than those
supplied with Microsoft Access version 1.0 or Microsoft Windows
version 3.1 can cause unexpected errors with Microsoft Access.
<P>
To avoid problems, make sure that all shared DLLs are at least as
current as those supplied with Microsoft Windows version 3.1 or
Microsoft Access version 1.0, and that they are all located in the
WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The shared DLLs used by Microsoft Access are:
<P>
<PRE>   COMMDLG.DLL   89248 bytes   3/10/92   Windows 3.1
   COMMDLG.DLL   89248 bytes   10/25/92  Access 1.0
   COMMDLG.DLL   89248 bytes   5/21/93   Access 1.1
   COMMDLG.DLL   97984 bytes   10/1/92   Windows for Workgroups

   OLECLI.DLL    83456 bytes             Same for all

   OLESVR.DLL    24064 bytes             Same for all

   DDEML.DLL     36864 bytes   3/10/92   Windows 3.1
   DDEML.DLL     36964 bytes   10/25/92  Access 1.0
   DDEML.DLL     36964 bytes   5/21/93   Access 1.1
   DDEML.DLL     38400 bytes   10/1/92   Windows for Workgroups

   SHELL.DLL     41600 bytes   3/10/92   Windows 3.1
   SHELL.DLL     41600 bytes   10/25/92  Access 1.0
   SHELL.DLL     41600 bytes   5/21/93   Access 1.1
   SHELL.DLL     41520 bytes   10/1/92   Windows for Workgroups

   VER.DLL        9008 bytes             Same for all

</PRE>(These DLLs are used by Windows applications other than Microsoft
Access, as shown above. The DLLs for which no date is provided are the
same for all applications.)
<P>
Microsoft Access supplies the same DLL versions as Windows 3.1, and it
requires these (or newer) versions for correct operation; older
versions can cause errors.
<P>
Microsoft Access and Windows copy shared DLLs into the WINDOWS\SYSTEM
subdirectory, and that is where Microsoft Access first looks for them.
If it does not find one or more of the shared DLLs, it looks in the
directory where Microsoft Access is installed, and then in the current
directory.
<P>
Often, Microsoft Access finds outdated or incorrect DLLs because
third-party software with old or foreign DLLs has been installed or
reinstalled, overwriting the correct DLLs. Some third-party software
packages copy DLLs into directories other than WINDOWS\SYSTEM,
creating multiple copies and making the problem harder to track and
resolve.
<P>
Microsoft Access will not reload DLLs previously loaded by another
software package; it will only load shared DLLs not already loaded. If
the previously loaded DLLs are incorrect, they can cause problems with
Microsoft Access.
<P>
If the Microsoft Access Setup program fails to locate a shared DLL, or
detects an older version of one, it issues an error message such as:
<P>
<PRE>   Outdated XXXX.DLL found. Please reinstall MSAccess.

   -or-

   Can't find XXXX.DLL.
