<UL><LI>Microsoft Access version 2.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multiuser skills.
<P>
Microsoft Access does not have a built-in DragDrop event for controls as
does Visual Basic. This article describes how to create a DragDrop
procedure that will run in response to a Microsoft Access control being
dragged to another control.
<P>
This article provides two examples that demonstrate the use of the DragDrop
procedure. The first example demonstrates how to drag the value in a
control on one form to a control on a second form. The second example
demonstrates how to move items from one list box to a second list box using
a drag-and-drop procedure. If you perform a drag-and-drop procedure with
the CTRL key held down, all items from one list will be moved to the second
list.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The four procedures below, DragStart, DragStop, DropDetect, and DragDrop,
are required to implement drag-and-drop capabilities between controls in
Microsoft Access.
<P>
<P><h3>DragStart, DragStop</h3>
 
<P>
Enables a control to be dragged. DragStart and DragStop are called from the
MouseDown and MouseUp events respectively for each control that you want to
be capable of being dragged.
<P>
<PRE>   Syntax:

      Sub DragStart (DragFrm As Form)
      Sub DragStop ()

      DragFrm: The form containing the control being dragged.

   Example:

      Private Sub MyControl_MouseDown (Button As Integer, Shift As ...
         DragStart Me
      End Sub

      Private Sub MyControl_MouseDown (Button As Integer, Shift As ...
         DragStop
      End Sub

</PRE><h3>DropDetect</h3>
 
<P>
Enables a control to be a drop target. DropDetect should be called from the
MouseMove event for each control that you want to be a drop target for a
control being dragged.
<P>
<PRE>   Syntax:

      Sub DropDetect (DropFrm As Form, DropCtrl As Control,
                      Button As Integer, Shift As Integer,
                      X As Single, Y As Single)

      DropFrm: The form containing the control being dropped on.
      DropCtrl: The control being dropped on.
      Button, Shift, X, Y: The parameters from the MouseMove event.

   Example:

      Private Sub MyControl_MouseMove (Button As Integer, Shift As ...
         DropDetect Me, Me![Employee ID], Button, Shift, X, Y
      End Sub

</PRE>NOTE: A control can be dragged and be a drop target by calling DragStart,
DragStop, and DropDetect from the MouseDown, MouseUp, and MouseMove events
respectively.
<P>
<P><h3>DragDrop</h3>
 
<P>
This procedure will be called in response to a drag-enabled control being
dragged to a drop-enabled control. You will add your own code to this
procedure to control what happens in response to a drop operation.
For example you could copy the contents of the dragged control to the
dropped control.
<P>
<PRE>   Syntax:

      Sub DragDrop (DragFrm As Form, DragCtrl As Control, DropFrm As Form,
                    DropCtrl As Control, Button As Integer, Shift As _
                         Integer,
                    X As Single, Y As Single)

   DragFrm:  The form containing the control being dragged.
   DragCtrl: The control being dragged.
   DropFrm:  The form containing the control being dropped on.
   DropCtrl: The control being dropped on.
   Button:   The state of the mouse buttons when the drop occurred.
   Shift:    The state of the SHIFT, CTRL, ALT keys when the drop occurred.
   X, Y:     The x and y coordinates of the mouse where the drop occurred.

   NOTE: For more information on Button, Shift, X, Y arguments, search
   online Help for the MouseMove event.

</PRE>Example:
<P>
The following example will copy the contents of the drag control to the
drop control, trapping and displaying any error that occurs:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub DragDrop (DragFrm As Form, DragCtrl As Control, ...
      On Error Resume Next
      DropCtrl = DragCtrl
      If Err Then MsgBox Error$
   End Sub

</PRE><h3>EXAMPLE 1: Drag and Drop Between Controls on Two Forms</h3>
 
<P>
The following example demonstrates how to set the Salesperson combo box on
the Northwind Orders form to an employee by dragging the Employee ID field
to the Employees form and dropping it into the Salesperson combo box.
<P>
NOTE: In the following sample code, an underscore (_) at the end of a line
is used as a line-continuation character. Remove the underscore from the
end of the line when re-creating this code.

<OL><P><LI>Open the sample database NWIND.MDB.

<P><LI>Create a new module and type the following lines in the Declarations
    section:
<P>
       Option Explicit
<P>
       Dim DragFrm As Form
       Dim DragCtrl As Control
       Dim DropTime
<P>
       Const MAX_DROP_TIME = .1
<P>
       Dim CurrentMode As Integer
       Const NO_MODE = 0
       Const DROP_MODE = 1
       Const DRAG_MODE = 2

<P><LI>Type the following three procedures:
<P>
<PRE>       Sub DragStart (SourceFrm As Form)
          ' NOTE: You should not use Screen.ActiveForm in place of
          ' SourceFrm because you may be dragging from a subform.
          Set DragFrm = SourceFrm
          Set DragCtrl = Screen.ActiveControl
          CurrentMode = DRAG_MODE
       End Sub

       Sub DragStop ()
          CurrentMode = DROP_MODE
          DropTime = Timer
       End Sub

       Sub DropDetect (DropFrm As Form, DropCtrl As Control, _
                       Button As Integer, Shift As Integer, _
                       X As Single, Y As Single)
          ' If a drop hasn't happened, then exit.
          If CurrentMode &lt;&gt; DROP_MODE Then Exit Sub
          CurrentMode = NO_MODE

          ' The timer interval is permitted between the MouseUp event and
          ' the MouseMove event. This ensures that the MouseMove event does
          ' not invoke the Drop procedure unless it is the MouseMove event
          ' that Microsoft Access automatically fires for the Drop control
          ' following the MouseUp event of a drag control. Subsequent
          ' MouseMove events will fail the timer test and be ignored.

          If Timer - DropTime &gt; MAX_DROP_TIME Then Exit Sub

          ' Did we drag/drop onto ourselves?
          If (DragCtrl.Name &lt;&gt; DropCtrl.Name) Or _
             (DragFrm.hWnd &lt;&gt; DropFrm.hWnd) Then
             ' If not, then a successful drag/drop occurred.
         DragDrop DragFrm, DragCtrl, DropFrm, DropCtrl, Button, Shift, X, Y
         End If
       End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>Type the following DragDrop procedure.
<P>
    NOTE: This procedure does not have to appear in the same module as the
    procedures typed above. Because you will be customizing the contents
    of the DragDrop procedure to respond to a successful drag-and-drop
    operation, it may be better to place it in a separate module.
<P>
<PRE>       Sub DragDrop (DragFrm As Form, DragCtrl As Control, _
                     DropFrm As Form, DropCtrl As Control, _
                     Button As Integer, Shift As Integer, _
                     X As Single, Y As Single)
          On Error Resume Next
          DropCtrl = DragCtrl
          If Err Then MsgBox Error$
       End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>Open the Orders form and add the following MouseMove event procedure
    code for the Salesperson combo box:
<P>
<PRE>       Sub Employee_ID_MouseMove (Button As Integer, Shift As Integer, _
          X As Single, Y As Single)
          DropDetect Me, Me![Employee ID], Button, Shift, X, Y
       End Sub

    NOTE: This control will only be a drop target.

</PRE><P><LI>Add the following event procedure code for the Employee ID control:
<P>
<PRE>      Sub Employee_ID_MouseDown (Button As Integer, Shift As Integer, _
      X As Single, Y As Single)
         DragStart Me
      End Sub

      Sub Employee_ID_MouseUp (Button As Integer, Shift As Integer, _
      X As Single, Y As Single)
         DragStop
      End Sub

    NOTE: This control will only be a drag target.

</PRE><P><LI>View the Orders form and position it in the upper-left corner of the
    screen.

<P><LI>View the Employees form and position it on top of the Orders form, but
    to the right in such a way that the Salesperson combo box on the Orders
    form is still visible.

<P><LI>Hold down the mouse button in the Employee ID text box in the Employees
    form, then move the mouse pointer (still holding the button down) over
    the Salesperson combo box on the Orders form, and then release the
    mouse button.
<P>
</OL>RESULT: The Salesperson combo box will contain the salesperson that you
dragged from the Employees form. Try navigating to different Employee
records and dragging the Employee ID to the Salesperson combo box.
<P>
<P><h3>EXAMPLE 2: Drag and Move Items from One list box to Another list box</h3>
