The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access versions 1.0, 1.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article demonstrates two methods for creating a form to edit data
without adding new records.
<P>
The first method uses a macro to move the insertion point to the last
record when you try to go to a new record. The second method uses a query
that makes it impossible to add a new record and also prevents a blank new
record.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1: Macro Method</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create a new macro called EditOnlyMacro:
<P>
<PRE>      Condition:               Action
      ----------------------------------------------
      [Product ID] Is Null     DoMenuItem
                                  Menu Bar: Form
                                  Menu Name: Records
                                  Command: GoTo
                                  Subcommand: Last

</PRE><P><LI>Open the Products form in Design view. In the OnCurrent property,
   add the name of the macro that you created above.
<P>
</OL><h3>Method 2: Query Method</h3>
 
<P>
Editing the Products Table Without Adding New Records:
<P>
This example makes it possible to edit records in the Products table
without adding any new records. The Categories table is the "one" side
(also called the "parent") and the Products table is the "many" side of
this one-to-many relationship. The linked field, Category ID, is from the
Categories table.
<P>
If the table in which you want to edit records is not on the "many" side of
the one-to-many relationship, one method you can use to create a parent
table is shown below:

<OL><P><LI>Create a new query called EditOnlyQuery:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Type: Select Query
      Join: Categories.[Category ID] &lt;-&gt; Products.[Category ID]
      Field: Category ID
<PRE></PRE>         Table: Categories
      Field: Product ID
         Table: Products
      Field: Supplier ID
         Table: Products
      Field: Product Name
         Table: Products
      Drag the rest of the fields down from the Products table

   NOTE: The Category ID field is from the Categories table, not the
   Products table.

</PRE><P><LI>Open the Products form in Design view. Change the RecordSource
   property of the Products form from Products to EditOnlyQuery.
<P>
</OL>Editing the Categories Table Without Adding New Records:
<P>
The above method depends on using the ID field of the parent table in a one-
to-many relationship. If the table you want to edit does not have a parent
table, you can create one. For instance, if you want to edit data in the
Categories table, but not add new records, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Create a new table called NewParent as follows with one primary key
   field:
<P>
<P><PRE>      FieldName: ID
<PRE></PRE>         DataType: Number
         FieldSize: Byte

</PRE><P><LI>Save the table, then switch to Datasheet view.

<P><LI>Type "1" (without quotation marks) in the first record, then close the
   table.

<P><LI>Open the table that you want to edit in Design view, and add the
   following field:
<P>
<P><PRE>      FieldName: EditOnlyJoin
<PRE></PRE>         DataType: Number
         FieldSize: Byte

</PRE><P><LI>Now type "1" (without quotation marks) in every record. Hint: Use an
   update query to do this.

<P><LI>Establish a relationship between the NewParent table and the
   Categories table. The NewParent table is the "one" side and the
   Categories table is the "many" side of the one-to-many
   relationship. (In the Database window, choose Edit Relationships
   from the Edit menu to establish the relationship.)

<P><LI>Add the NewParent and Categories tables in a query (see Method 2
   above). Be sure that this new query has the ID field from the NewParent
   table and does not have the EditOnlyJoin field from the Categories
   table.
