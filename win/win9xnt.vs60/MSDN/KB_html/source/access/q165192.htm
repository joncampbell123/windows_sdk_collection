The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Novice: Requires knowledge of the user interface on single-user computers.
<P>
When you use the "Publish to the Web Wizard" to create HTML, HTX/IDC, or
ASP files, the wizard does not prompt you before it overwrites an existing
file with the same name.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
If you want to be sure you do not overwrite a file by the same name when
you export an object to an HTML format, use the Save As/Export command on
the File menu to output the object. This command enables you to create the
same types of files that the "Publish to the Web Wizard" does, and it
prompts you to verify that you want to overwrite an existing file.
<P>
Another advantage of using the Save As/Export command is that you can
customize the file name you are outputting; a disadvantage is that you can
only output one database object at a time.
<P>
For more information about using custom file names with files in HTML
format, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : ACC97: Publish to the Web Wizard Does Not Allow Custom File
               Name

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Invoke the "Publish to the Web Wizard" by clicking Save As HTML on the
File menu. The wizard enables you to save the selections you make on each
of its screens in a Web publication profile. If you want to create a new
set of HTML files with the same parameters that you saved previously in a
Web profile, the wizard recreates the same file names in the same location
without prompting you to overwrite existing files. You might use this
feature, for example, if you regularly want to recreate static HTML files
after your data has changed, or if you want to recreate dynamic IDC/HTX or
ASP files after you change the design of a form or report.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start Microsoft Access and open the sample database Northwind.mdb.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Save As HTML.

<P><LI>Click Next on the opening screen of the "Publish to the Web" Wizard.

<P><LI>On the "What do you want to publish?" screen, click the Shippers table,
   and then click Next.

<P><LI>On the "What HTML document do you want to use as a default template?"
   screen, click Next.

<P><LI>On the "What default format type do you want to create?" screen, click
   Static HTML, and then click Next.

<P><LI>On the "Where do you want to publish to?" screen, type C:\My Documents
   in the "I want to put my Web publication in this folder" box, and then
   click Finish.

<P><LI>Use Windows Explorer or File Manager to view the properties of the
   Shippers_1.html file in the C:\My Documents folder. Note the date and
   time the file was created.

<P><LI>Repeat steps 1-8. Note that you are not prompted to overwrite the file,
   and that the date and time on the file have changed, indicating that it
   was overwritten.
