The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access versions 1.0, 1.1, 2.0, 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multiuser skills.
<P>
Microsoft Access supports dynamic data exchange (DDE) as both a client
(destination) and a server (source) application. This article lists the
DDE topics that Microsoft Access supports as a DDE server and the valid
DDE items for each topic.
<P>
NOTE: All the examples in this article require that you have the sample
database Northwind.mdb in Microsoft Access version 7.0 (or NWIND.MDB in
earlier versions) open.
<P>
NOTE: For information about using Microsoft Access as a DDE server in
Microsoft Access 97, search the Help Index for "DDE, overview."
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
As a DDE server, Microsoft Access supports the following topics:

<UL><LI>The System topic
<LI>The name of a database, table, or query
<LI>A Microsoft Access SQL statement
<P>
</UL><h3>The System Topic</h3>
 
<P>
The System topic is a standard topic for all Microsoft Windows-based
DDE server applications, and returns information about the topics
supported by the application. The System topic supports the following
Microsoft Access data items:

<UL><LI>SysItems: Lists items supported by the System topic in Microsoft Access
<LI>Formats:  Lists formats Microsoft Access can copy to the Clipboard
<LI>Status:   "Busy" or "Ready"
<LI>Topics:   Lists all open databases
<P>
</UL>Note that any information returned from any item used with the System
topic is tab delimited.
<P>
The following sample Microsoft Word for Windows WordBasic macro
demonstrates how to use the System topic to get information about
available topics from Microsoft Access:
<P>
<PRE>   Chan = DDEInitiate("MSAccess", "System")
   Topics$ = DDERequest$(Chan, "Topics")
   DDETerminate Chan
   MsgBox Topics$, "Topics", 64

</PRE><h3>The Database Topic</h3>
 
<P>
The database topic is the file name of an existing database. After you
initiate a DDE conversation with the database, you can request a list of
objects in that database. This list of information is TAB delimited.
<P>
NOTE: You cannot use DDE to query the Microsoft Access Workgroup
Information file (System.mda in Microsoft Access versions 1.x and 2.0).
<P>
The database topic supports the following items:

<UL><LI>TableList
<LI>QueryList
<LI>FormList
<LI>ReportList
<LI>MacroList
<LI>ModuleList
<P>
</UL>The following sample Word for Windows WordBasic macros demonstrate how to
retrieve a list of table names in the Northwind.mdb and NWIND.MDB
databases:
<P>
<PRE>   In version 7.0:

      Chan = DDEInitiate("MSAccess", "Northwind")
      TableList$ = DDERequest$(Chan, "TableList")
      MsgBox TableList$, "TableList", 64
      DDETerminate Chan

   In earlier versions:

      Chan = DDEInitiate("MSAccess", "Nwind")
      TableList$ = DDERequest$(Chan, "TableList")
      MsgBox TableList$, "TableList", 64
      DDETerminate Chan

</PRE><h3>The TABLE TableName, QUERY QueryName, and SQL SQLString Topics</h3>
 
<P>
The TABLE, QUERY, and SQL DDE topics are used to retrieve information
from Microsoft Access tables. The returned information is TAB delimited.
The syntax for these topics is as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   &lt;DatabaseName&gt;; TABLE &lt;TableName&gt;

   &lt;DatabaseName&gt;; QUERY &lt;QueryName&gt;

   &lt;DatabaseName&gt;; SQL &lt;SQLString&gt;

</PRE>Description of Syntax:
<P>
<PRE>   &lt;DatabaseName&gt;   The name of the database to which the table or query
                    belongs or the SQL statement applies, followed by
                    a semicolon (;). The database name can be either the
                    base name only (for example, Northwind or Nwind), or
                    its full path and .mdb extension (for example,
                    C:\Msoffice\Access\Samples\Northwind.mdb or
                    C:\Access\Nwind.mdb).

   &lt;TableName&gt;      The name of an existing table.

   &lt;QueryName&gt;      The name of an existing query.

   &lt;SQLString&gt;      A valid SQL SELECT statement of up to 256 characters,
                    ending with a semicolon (;). Note that you can
                    exchange more than 256 characters by omitting the
                    &lt;SQLString&gt; statement and using successive DDEPoke()
                    statements to build an SQL statement. For example, the
                    following WordBasic code uses the DDEPoke() function
                    to build an SQL statement and request the results of
                    the query:

                     Chan1 = DDEInitiate("MSAccess", "Northwind;SQL")
                     DDEPoke Chan1, "SQLText", "SELECT *"
                     DDEPoke Chan1, "SQLText", " FROM Orders"
                     DDEPoke Chan1, "SQLText", " WHERE [Freight] &gt; 100;"
                     Res$ = DDERequest$(Chan1, "NextRow")
                     MsgBox Res$, "NextRow", 64
                     DDETerminate Chan1

</PRE>Note that the maximum length of a SQL SELECT statement is 255 characters
in Microsoft Access 1.x and 2.0.
<P>
Note that you cannot initiate a DDE link with Microsoft Access using an
action query. Action queries, such as append (INSERT INTO), update
(UPDATE...SET), Delete (DELETE...FROM), and make-table (SELECT...INTO)
perform an action on data. A select query, which finds and returns data,
can be used as the topic of a DDE conversation.
<P>
NOTE: In this article, an asterisk (*) indicates a feature that is not
available in Microsoft Access version 1.x. You can perform SQL action
queries using DDE by running the RunSQL macro action using the
DDEExecute() function.
<P>
The following is a list of valid DDE items for the TABLE TableName,
QUERY QueryName, and SQL SQLString DDE topics:
<P>
<PRE>   All              All data in the table, including field names.

   Data             All rows of data, without field names.

   *FieldNames      A single-row list of field names.

   FieldNames;T     Two data records, the first a list of field names,
                    and the second a list of data types. The data types
                    are:

                     0    Invalid
                     1    True/False (non-NULL)
                     2    Unsigned byte (Byte)
                     3    2-byte signed integer (Integer)
                     4    4-byte signed integer (Long)
                     5    8-byte signed integer (Currency)
                     6    4-byte single-precision floating point (Single)
                     7    8-byte double-precision floating point (Double)
                     8    Date/Time (date is integer, time is fraction)
                     9    Binary data, 255-byte maximum
                    10    ANSI text, not case sensitive, 255-byte
                          maximum (Text)
                    11    Long binary (OLE Object)
                    12    Long text (Memo)

   NextRow          The data in the next row in the table or query.
                    When you first open a channel, NextRow returns the
                    data in the first row. If the current row is the last
                    record and you execute NextRow, the request fails.

   PrevRow          The data in the previous row in the table or query.
                    If PrevRow is the first request on a new channel, the
                    data in the last row of the table or query is
                    returned. If the first record is the current row, the
                    request fails.

   FirstRow         The data in the first row of the table or query.

   LastRow          The data in the last row of the table or query.

   FieldCount       The number of fields in the table or query.

   *SQLText         An SQL statement representing the table or query.
                    For tables, this item returns an SQL statement in the
                    "SELECT * FROM table;" format.

   *SQLText;&lt;n&gt;     An SQL statement in &lt;n&gt;-character chunks that
                    represents the table or query, where &lt;n&gt; is an
                    integer lower than 255. For example, for a query
                    represented by the SQL statement "SELECT * FROM
                    Orders;" the item "SQLText;7" would return the
                    following tab-delimited chunks:

                       SELECT
                       * FROM
                       Orders;

</PRE>The following sample WordBasic macro demonstrates how to retrieve
information from the Products table in Northwind.mdb:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub MAIN
      Chan1 = DDEInitiate("MSAccess", "Northwind;TABLE Products")
      'Get a count of the number of Product records where the
      'Product ID is less than 10.
      SQL$ = "SELECT Count([Product ID]) AS [CountOfProducts] "
      SQL$ = SQL$ + "FROM Products WHERE [Product ID] &lt; 10;"
      Chan2 = DDEInitiate("MSAccess", "Northwind;SQL " + SQL$)
      ProductCount =  Val(DDERequest$(Chan2, "FirstRow"))
      DDETerminate Chan2

      ' Quit if there are no records.
      If ProductCount &lt;&gt; 0 Then
         Msg$ = "Northwind Product Information:"
         Msg$ = Msg$ + "       Record Count:" + Str$(ProductCount)
         MsgBox Msg$

         ' Request the first row of data from the Products table.
         Data$ = DDERequest$(Chan1, "FirstRow")

         ' Display the records.
         For i = 1 To ProductCount
            MsgBox Data$
            ' Get the next row of data, if not at the end.
            If i &lt;&gt; ProductCount Then
               Data$ = DDERequest$(Chan1, "NextRow")
            End If
         Next i
      End If

   End Sub

</PRE><h3>Running Macros and Commands in Microsoft Access Using DDE</h3>
 
<P>
When you are using Microsoft Access as a DDE server, you can use the
DDEExecute() function to instruct your application to carry out a
command. Microsoft Access recognizes any of the following valid
commands.
<P>
NOTE: In this article, an asterisk (*) indicates a feature that is not
available in Microsoft Access version 1.x.

<UL><LI>The name of a macro in the currently open database. A macro
   can be run on a channel with any of the five topics described
   above.

<LI>Any action that you can run in Access Basic using the DoCmd()
   statement. You cannot run the following macro actions: AddMenu,
   MsgBox, RunApp, RunCode, SendKeys, SetValue, StopAllMacros,
   and StopMacro.

<LI>The OpenDatabase and CloseDatabase actions, run only for DDE
   operations using the System topic.
<P>
</UL>Note that when you specify an action as a DDEExecute command, the action
and any arguments follow the DoCmd() syntax and must be enclosed in
brackets ([]). However, applications that support DDE do not recognize
intrinsic constants, such as A_NORMAL, in DDE operations. Therefore,
you must use the actual number as an argument. Also, string arguments
must be enclosed in quotation marks only if the string contains a
comma. Otherwise, quotation marks are not required.
<P>
The following sample macro opens the Categories form, first minimized and
then restored:
<P>
<PRE>   Chan = DDEInitiate("MSACCESS", "System")
   AppActivate "Microsoft Access"
   DDEExecute Chan, "[OpenForm Categories,,,,,2]"
   DDEExecute Chan, "[OpenForm Categories]"
   DDETerminate Chan

</PRE><h3>Using the OpenDatabase and CloseDatabase Commands</h3>
 
<P>
The following commands can be carried out on a channel opened to the
System topic. These commands facilitate the remote opening and closing
of databases in Microsoft Access from the client application.

<UL><LI>OpenDatabase &lt;DatabaseName&gt; [, Exclusive[, ReadOnly]]

<LI>CloseDatabase
<P>
<PRE>    &lt;DatabaseName&gt;   A string expression that is the name of an existing
                     database. This can include the fully qualified
                     MS-DOS path.

    [Exclusive]      A Boolean value that is True (-1) if the database is
                     to be opened with exclusive (nonshared) access and
                     False (0) if the database is to be opened with shared
                     access. The default is shared access.

    [ReadOnly]       A Boolean value that is True if the database is to be
                     opened with read-only access and False if it is to be
                     opened with read/write access. The default is
                     read/write access.

</PRE></UL>The following sample WordBasic macro demonstrates how to use the
OpenDatabase actions to remotely open NWIND.MDB and then open the
Employees form:
<P>
<PRE>   Chan = DDEInitiate("MSACCESS", "System")
   DDEExecute Chan, "[OpenDatabase Nwind.mdb]"
   DDEExecute Chan, "[OpenForm Employees,0,,,1,0]"
   DDETerminate Chan
