The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
Microsoft Access 97 and the Microsoft Jet database engine version 3.5 use
the DISTINCTROW predicate differently than did earlier versions. This
article discusses the differences in queries that use DISTINCTROW.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The DISTINCTROW predicate is the SQL equivalent of setting the
UniqueRecords property in a query to Yes. In Microsoft Access 97, the
default setting for the UniqueRecords property in a query is No, which
eliminates DISTINCTROW from the query's SQL statement. In Microsoft Access
2.0 and 7.0, the default setting for the UniqueRecords property is Yes,
which adds DISTINCTROW to the query's SQL statement.
<P>
Changes in the Microsoft Jet database engine included with Microsoft Access
97 cause the program to handle the SQL reserved word, DISTINCTROW,
differently than it did in earlier versions. Three types of queries are
affected by the change: update queries, delete queries, and select queries.
<P>
NOTE: Using DISTINCTROW in a query has no effect unless the query contains
two or more joined tables.
<P>
<P><h3>Update Queries</h3>
 
<P>
If you run an update query that you imported from a Microsoft Access 2.0 or
7.0 database, or if you run an existing update query in a database that you
converted in Microsoft Access 97 from an earlier version, you may receive
the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Operation must use an updatable query.

</PRE>To resolve this error message, set the query's UniqueRecords property to
No, as follows:

<OL><P><LI>Open the update query in Design view.

<P><LI>If the property sheet is not already open, on the View menu, click
   Properties.

<P><LI>Click an empty area in the upper half of the query window so the
   property sheet displays Query Properties in the title bar.

<P><LI>Set the UniqueRecords property to No.

<P><LI>Save the query, close it, and then run the query.
<P>
</OL><h3>Delete Queries</h3>
 
<P>
When a delete query contains more than one table, such as a query that
deletes duplicate records from one of the tables, the UniqueRecords
property must be set to Yes for all versions of Microsoft Access. However,
because the default value for UniqueRecords is No in Microsoft Access 97,
you must set the value of this property manually when you create a new
delete query in Microsoft Access 97, as follows:

<OL><P><LI>Open the delete query in Design view.

<P><LI>If the property sheet is not already open, on the View menu, click
   Properties.

<P><LI>Click an empty area in the upper half of the query window so the
   property sheet displays Query Properties in the title bar.

<P><LI>Set the UniqueRecords property to Yes.

<P><LI>Save the query, close it, and then run the query.
<P>
</OL>For more information about using a delete query to remove duplicate
records, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../access/q98664.htm">Q98664</A></B>
   TITLE     : ACC: Deleting Duplicate Records from Two Tables

</PRE></OL><h3>Select Queries</h3>
 
<P>
Some select queries that are updatable in Microsoft Access 2.0 or 7.0 may
display the following information on the message line when you try to
update them in Microsoft Access 97:
<P>
<PRE>   This Recordset is not updatable.

</PRE>To resolve this error message, set the query's UniqueRecords property to
No, as follows:

<OL><P><LI>Open the select query in Design view.

<P><LI>If the property sheet is not already open, on the View menu, click
   Properties.

<P><LI>Click an empty area in the upper half of the query window so the
   property sheet displays Query Properties in the title bar.

<P><LI>Set the UniqueRecords property to No.

<P><LI>Save the query, close it, and then run the query. Note that Microsoft
   Access 97 allows you to update the data in the query.
