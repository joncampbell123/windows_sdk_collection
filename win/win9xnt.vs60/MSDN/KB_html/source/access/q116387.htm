The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access version 1.0, 1.1, 2.0, 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
When you try to open a Microsoft Access database, you receive the following
error message even though you are running SHARE.EXE or VSHARE.386:
<P>
<PRE>   Couldn't lock file; SHARE.EXE hasn't been loaded.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This error can occur if Microsoft Access cannot perform record locking on
the database's corresponding .ldb file. If, for example, the .ldb file is
set to Read-Only, either on your local hard disk or on a network server,
this problem occurs.
<P>
With an administrative network setup (setup /a), the .ldb files under
the Workdir folder are not created until the first user opens Microsoft
Access. This error can also occur if the first user does not have Create
rights.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Set the .ldb file to Read-Write, not Read-Only. Also give Read, Write, and
Create rights to the Workdir folder for each user that is using Microsoft
Access.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Access may automatically create a locking information (.ldb) file
for a database. This file will have the same name as the database itself,
but will have an .ldb extension and will be created in the same folder
as the database.
<P>
Even if an .ldb file on a network server is set to read-write, network
security may cause Microsoft Access to behave as if the file were read-
only.
<P>
To check whether an .ldb file is read-write or read-only, follow these
steps:
<P>
In Windows 95:

<OL><P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Programs, and then click Windows
   Explorer.

<P><LI>Locate an .ldb File, and using the right mouse button, click the .ldb
   file, and then click Properties on the menu that appears.

<P><LI>In the .ldb Properties dialog box, if the Read-Only check box is
   checked, clear the check box to set the file to Read-Write.
<P>
</OL>In earlier versions of Windows:

<OL><P><LI>Start File Manager.

<P><LI>Locate and then select the .LDB file.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Properties. If the Read-Only check box is
   selected, clear the check box to set the file to read-write.
<P>
</OL><h2>REFERENCES</h2>
 
<P>
For more information about .ldb files, search for "LDB files" then "Locking
Information Files (Common Questions)" using the Microsoft Access Help menu.
