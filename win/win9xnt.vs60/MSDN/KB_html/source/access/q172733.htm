<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Jet35upd.exe file contains an update of two .dll files that are
included with Microsoft Access 97, Microsoft Office 97 Professional
Edition, and Microsoft Visual Basic version 5.0. Microsoft Jet database
engine version 3.51 provides an improved Compact utility that combines
Compact and Repair into a single process. Also, the updated version of the
Jet database engine generates an error if it encounters a problem during
the Compact process and then creates the table MSysCompactError in the
destination database.
<P>
NOTE: Jetcomp.exe, which is included with Jet35upd.exe, is a stand-alone
utility that allows you to compact databases created with Microsoft Jet
database engine 3.x. This utility may be used in conjunction with
Microsoft Jet database engine 3.51 for recovering corrupted databases.
Although it is possible to use the Microsoft Access Compact utility or the
CompactDatabase method with Microsoft Jet database engine 3.51, Jetcomp.exe
may be able to recover some databases that these utilities could not. This
is because the Microsoft Access Compact utility and the CompactDatabase
method attempt to open and close a database before attempting to compact
it. In certain cases where these utilities may not be able to reopen the
database, Compact will be unable to proceed, preventing recovery of the
database. Jetcomp.exe does not attempt to open and close the database
before compacting, and may be able to recover some databases that the
Microsoft Access compact utility and the CompactDatabase method could not.
Jetcomp.exe is a freely distributable utility, but requires that you have
one of the following products installed:
