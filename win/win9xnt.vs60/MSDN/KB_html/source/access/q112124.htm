<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Novice: Requires knowledge of the user interface on single-user computers.
<P>
Microsoft offers the cost-saving option for you to upgrade from previous
versions of its products, or to upgrade from a competitive product, for a
decreased price. To ensure that the purchase is a true upgrade or a
competitive upgrade, several Microsoft products run a program called the
Compliance Checking program (CCP) before running Setup.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
CCP is used by Microsoft Access version 2.0, as well as by other Microsoft
products such as Microsoft Word for Windows and Microsoft Excel. CCP checks
for previously installed software on your system that meets upgrade or
competitive upgrade criteria before you can install the upgrade. (The
restriction criteria vary according to the package you purchase and the
country in which you purchase it. See the product's documentation for
details.)
<P>
CCP uses a list of acceptable Microsoft or competitors' products for the
compliance checking. If the CCP program finds one of these products
installed on your system, it allows Setup to continue. If CCP does not find
one of the accepted products in the product list, it asks you to list the
directory where an acceptable product is installed. This includes any
location on a hard disk, CD-ROM, network drive, or floppy disk.
<P>
For example, if you purchase and install a Microsoft Access 2.0 upgrade
package to upgrade from Microsoft Access version 1.1 to 2.0, CCP checks for
the presence of Microsoft Access 1.1 on your system before installation can
occur. If you purchase a competitive upgrade package to upgrade from
Borland Paradox version 4.5 for Windows to Microsoft Access 2.0, CCP checks
for the presence of Borland Paradox version 4.5 for Windows on your system
before installation can occur. The back of the upgrade package box
describes how compliance is handled, and lists acceptable competitive
products. On the box, the term "special software" refers to CCP. Otherwise,
the reseller is mentioned.
<P>
<P><h3>Different CCP Versions</h3>
 
<P>
There are two different versions of CCP: Lenient and Strict. Lenient CCP is
used in all U.S. versions of Microsoft Access, while Strict CCP is used in
countries other than the United States.
<P>
If Lenient CCP does not find one of the acceptable products in the product
list, it is a restriction violation. However, only a warning is given and
installation does occur.
<P>
When Strict CCP perceives a violation, it halts installation with a
violation message stating that installation cannot continue.
<P>
<P><h3>Product List</h3>
 
<P>
In the United States, an upgrade to Microsoft Access version 2.0 requires
only a previous installation of Microsoft Access version 1.x.
<P>
A competitive upgrade in the United States requires a previous installation
of any of the following products:
