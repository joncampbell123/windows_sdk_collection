<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Novice: Requires knowledge of the user interface on single-user computers.
<P>
Although the Microsoft Windows Printing system printer driver appears to
work correctly with most Microsoft Office for Windows 95 programs, you may
receive the following error message when you select the Microsoft Windows
Printing System printer driver to print an object in Microsoft Access for
Windows 95 version 7.0:
<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft Access Couldn't Print Your Object

</PRE>NOTE: Many printers use this driver, including the Lexmark Winwriter
series, NEC SuperScript series, HP LaserJet 4L and 5L, HP LaserJet II and
III series with the Microsoft Windows Printing System Cartridge and various
Canon and Star Micronics models. To determine if the selected driver is
based on the Microsoft Windows Printing System, use the About button in the
Printer Setup dialog box.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Do not use the Microsoft Windows Printing System driver with Microsoft
Access for Windows 95. Instead use another driver that is compatible with
your printer. For Hewlett-Packard LaserJet printers use the corresponding
PCL mode driver. For other printers, contact your printer's manufacturer or
consult your printer's documentation to determine if an alternate printer
driver can be used with your printer.
<P>
To change the printer driver to an alternate driver, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Printers.

<P><LI>In the Printers dialog box, double-click the Add Printer icon.

<P><LI>In the Add Printer Wizard dialog box, click Next, and then select the
   appropriate option for how the printer is attached to your computer.
   Click Next.

<P><LI>In the Add Printer Wizard dialog box, under Manufacturers, select
   your printer's manufacturer, and under Printers, select your
   manufacturer's recommended alternate driver. Click Next, and then follow
   the instructions on the screen.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: If you are using the HP 5L printer, it is important that you obtain
the latest printer driver for this model from Hewlett-Packard and that you
use the Custom Install option, selecting the HP PCL Driver for the HP
LaserJet 5L.
<P>
Most printer driver manufacturers will frequently supply updated printer
drivers. When obtaining these new drivers from the manufacturer, it is
important to check for a Readme file that may have been included. This
file will usually include specific instructions for installing the new
drivers.
<P>
If the problem continues after changing to a new printer driver, change the
Spool Data Format for your printer from EMF to RAW. To do so, follow these
steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Printers.

<P><LI>In the Printers dialog box, using the right mouse button, click your
   printer, and then click Properties.

<P><LI>In the &lt;Printer&gt; Properties dialog box, click the Details tab, and then
   click Spool Settings.

<P><LI>In the Spool Settings dialog box, in the Spool Data Format box, change
   the setting from EMF to RAW.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Access 7.0. This
problem no longer occurs in Microsoft Access 97.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Windows Printing System printer driver appears to send the
print job successfully when you print an object in Microsoft Access 7.0. In
fact, if you click Print Preview on the File menu, the Microsoft Access
object that you want to print is displayed accurately. When you click
Print, Windows 95 displays a dialog box that states the following
<P>
<PRE>   Now Printing &lt;'ObjectName'&gt;; to the &lt;'PrinterName'&gt; on LPT&lt;x&gt;

</PRE></OL>where &lt;'ObjectName'&gt; is the name of the Microsoft Access object you want to
print, &lt;'PrinterName'&gt; is the specific printer model, such as "Lexmark
WinWriter 600," and &lt;x&gt;; is the number representing the LPT port to which
the driver is pointing.
<P>
This dialog box makes it appear that the print job is about to be sent;
however, the dialog box shortly disappears and Microsoft Access displays an
error message that states the following:
<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft Access Couldn't Print Your Object.

</PRE>When you click OK, your document is not printed and Microsoft Access
displays a dialog box that states the following:
<P>
<PRE>   Solution
   Make sure that the specified printer is available. For
   information on setting a default printer, search the
   Windows on-line index for 'default printer, setting.'

</PRE>It is important to check the setting; however, with this situation, in most
cases the Microsoft Windows Printing System printer has already been
assigned as the specified printer, has been made available, and has been
set as the default printer.
<P>
To determine if the selected driver is based on the Microsoft Windows
Printing System:

<OL><P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Printers.

<P><LI>In the Printers dialog box, select your printer, and then on the File
   menu, click Properties.

<P><LI>In the Printer Properties dialog box, select the Paper tab, and then
   click the About button in the Printer Setup dialog box.
<P>
</OL><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Before starting Microsoft Access 7.0, install the Microsoft Windows
   Printing System print driver.

<P><LI>Open the sample database Northwind.mdb and click the Reports tab.

<P><LI>Open any report in Design view, and on the File menu, click Page Setup.

<P><LI>Click the Page tab, click to select the Use Specific Printer option, and
   then click Printer.

<P><LI>In the Page Setup dialog box, click the arrow next to the Name box,
   select the printer driver which corresponds to the Windows Printing
   System driver (it may be labeled with the specific model name of your
   printer), and then click OK.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Print Preview. Note that the report appears
   accurately. On the File menu, click Print. Note that you receive the
   error message "Microsoft Access Couldn't Print Your Object."
