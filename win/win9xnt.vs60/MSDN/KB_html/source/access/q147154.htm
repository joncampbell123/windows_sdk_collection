The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access versions 7.0, 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Novice: Requires knowledge of the user interface on single-user computers.
<P>
When you open a form that has the AllowAdditions property set to No, the
form opens, allowing you to add records.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The form is being opened programmatically using the OpenForm action with
the Data Mode argument in the macro set to "Edit." If you're using Visual
Basic, the Data Mode argument is set to A_EDIT or acEdit.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Omit the Data Mode argument setting so that Microsoft Access uses the
property settings defined by the form.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When the Data Mode argument of the OpenForm action is set, Microsoft
Access overrides a number of form property settings. If the Data Mode
argument of the OpenForm action is set to "Edit," Microsoft Access
opens the form using the following property settings:
<P>
<PRE>   Allow Edits: Yes
   Allow Deletions: Yes
   Allow Additions: Yes
   Data Entry: No

</PRE>Microsoft Access uses the default form property settings if you omit
the Data Mode setting in the OpenForm macro action.
<P>
This behavior is likely to occur when you have a macro that opens a
form, because the Data Mode argument is set to "Edit" by default.
Further, this behavior can also occur when converting from Microsoft
Access version 2.0.
<P>
In Microsoft Access version 2.0, you can open a form with the Data Mode
argument set to Edit and disallow the addition of new records. This is
possible by setting the singular DefaultEditing property to Can't Add
Records. This behavior is incorrect. Microsoft Access 2.0 does not
correctly override the DefaultEditing property with Allow Edits when
the form is opened with the Data Mode argument set to Edit.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Open the sample database Northwind.mdb.

<P><LI>Open the Customers form in Design view and set the AllowAdditions
   property to No. Save, and then close the form.

<P><LI>Create a new macro with the following action:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Macro Action
      -----------------------
      OpenForm
<PRE></PRE>         Form Name: Customers
         View: Form
         Filter Name:
         Where Condition:
         Data Mode: Edit
         Window Mode: Normal

      NOTE: The Data Mode argument is Edit by default.

</PRE><P><LI>Save the macro with a unique name, and then run the macro by clicking
   Start on the Run menu. Note that the Customers form opens but allows
   you to add new records.

<P><LI>Close the Customers form and delete Edit from the Data Mode argument
   of the OpenForm action. Save and rerun the macro by clicking Start on
   the Run menu. Note that the Customer form opens but does not allow you
   to add new records.
