The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access version 7.0, 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Novice: Requires knowledge of the user interface on single-user computers.
<P>
Forms will always open to a maximized state once any other Microsoft Access
window has been maximized (excluding the Microsoft Access Desktop).
However, when a Microsoft Access window is maximized, forms may briefly be
displayed in a restored state when first opened, instead of immediately
opening maximized. This behavior will vary, based on the setting of the
form's MinMaxButtons property.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Either set the MinMaxButtons property to Max Enabled or Both Enabled or
follow these steps when using the None or Min Enabled settings:

<OL><P><LI>Create a new, blank macro.

<P><LI>Add the Echo action as the first action to the macro and set its Echo On
   argument to No.

<P><LI>Add OpenForm as the second action to the macro and set its Form Name
   argument to the name of the form that will be opened maximized.

<P><LI>Add another Echo action as a third action to the macro and set its
   Echo On argument to Yes.

<P><LI>Save and run the macro.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Access 7.0
and 97. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you set a form's MinMaxButtons property to either None or Min Enabled,
the form is prevented from opening immediately to a maximized state.
Instead, the form will open momentarily to a restored state before being
displayed maximized.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Open the sample database Northwind.mdb.

<P><LI>Maximize the Database window.

<P><LI>Open the Products form in Design view.

<P><LI>If the property sheet is not open, click Properties on the View menu.

<P><LI>Click the All tab on the property sheet, and locate the MinMaxButtons
   property.

<P><LI>Set the MinMaxButtons property to either None or Min Enabled.

<P><LI>Click Form on the View menu and note that any Microsoft Access windows
   (the Database window, the Products form, and so on) briefly restores
   before the Products form is displayed maximized.
<P>
   NOTE: This behavior may not be obvious on fast computers.
