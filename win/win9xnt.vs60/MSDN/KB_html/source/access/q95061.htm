<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access versions 1.0, 1.1, 2.0, 7.0, 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multiuser skills.
<P>
When you try to gain access to the SQL Server, you may receive the error
message
<P>
<PRE>   Stored procedure 'PROCEDURE' not found

</PRE>where 'PROCEDURE' is the name of a stored procedure that cannot be found
but is necessary to gain access to the SQL Server.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The SQL Server 4.2 you are attempting to gain access to is not set up
correctly. It is missing the required stored procedures.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To correct this situation, install the necessary stored procedures on the
SQL Server by using the INSTCAT.SQL SQL script file supplied with the
Microsoft Access disk set.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Run INSTCAT.SQL to configure Microsoft SQL Server for use with ODBC, the
open database connectivity protocol used by Microsoft Access to link
(attach) SQL Server tables. INSTCAT.SQL is the SQL script file that ships
with ODBC. You need to run it to set up the stored procedures that
provide catalog information used by ODBC.
<P>
To install the catalog stored procedures using INSTCAT.SQL, run
INSTCAT.SQL using the SQL Server facility ISQL (Interactive SQL)
from the MS-DOS command line.
<P>
Following is the syntax for this procedure. Note that you need to enter
the two lines as one continuous line, and that you do not include the
angle braces &lt;&gt; in the command:
<P>
<PRE>   ISQL /U &lt;sa login name&gt; /n /P &lt;password&gt; /S &lt;SQL server name&gt;
   /i &lt;drive:\path\INSTCAT.SQL&gt; /o &lt;drive:\path\output file name&gt;

   Following is a description for each switch:

   /U    Gives the system administrator's login name.
   /n    Eliminates line numbering and prompting for user input.
   /P    Gives the system administrator's Password - case sensitive.
   /S    Gives the name of the server to set up.
   /i    Gives the drive and fully qualified path for INSTCAT.SQL.
   /o    Provides the output file destination for results of the
         process including errors.

</PRE>Here is a sample ISQL command line:
<P>
<PRE>   ISQL /U sa /n /P SA_Password /S SQL_SERVER /id:\SQL\INSTCAT.SQL
   /o d:\SQL\output.txt

</PRE>After running INSTCAT.SQL, run the RECONFIGURE command against the MASTER
database by using the SQL Administration Facility (SAF) from an MS-DOS
client or the server, or run the SQL Administrator program from a Microsoft
Windows client.
<P>
<P><h3>Other Possible Causes for this Error Message</h3>
 
<P>
It is possible that other situations can indirectly cause this error
message. Use the following steps to troubleshoot the problem:

<OL><P><LI>Use Windows Explorer (or File Manager in Windows 3.x) to search for
   multiple, corrupted, or outdated copies of these files:
<P>
<PRE>      ODBC.DLL      dated on or after 10-16-92 containing 44736 bytes
      DBNMP3.DLL    dated on or after 9-15-92 containing 8241 bytes
      SQLSRVR.DLL   dated on or after 10-16-92 containing 135792 bytes
      NETAPI.DLL    depends on the network being used
      COMMDLG.DLL   dated on or after 10-25-92 containing 89248 bytes

      NOTE: The sizes and dates referenced are correct if the files are
      installed by Microsoft Access version 1.0.

</PRE><P><LI>Make sure the files listed above are in appropriate locations. All
   the files except NETAPI.DLL are usually installed in the Windows
   System folder (directory). The NETAPI.DLL file is a network-specific
   driver that is usually located in the network's program folder, which
   should be in the path.

<P><LI>Use another application, such as Q+E, SAF, or PowerBuilder, on the
   same computer to attempt to link the same data source. If you cannot
   gain access to the data source from another application, there is
   probably a problem with the network. That is, there may be a problem
   with the NETAPI.DLL file or a problem with the SQL database server,
   not with Microsoft Access or ODBC.

<P><LI>Attempt to link to another data source such as another SQL server.
   If you are successful, the original server may be down, or you may
   need to reconfigure the entry for that server using the ODBC
   Administration Utility.

<P><LI>Attempt to link the same data source from another computer. If you
   cannot gain access to the SQL database server from another computer,
   there could be a network-wide problem or the server may be down or not
   communicating.

<P><LI>Try increasing the ODBC timeout property of your query. In Microsoft
   Access version 1.x or 2.0 try increasing the ODBC timeout in the
   MSACC20.INI file. In Microsoft Access 7.0 and 97, try increasing
   the ODBC timeout in the registry.
<P>
   For more information about setting the ODBC timeout in the Windows 95
   registry, please see the following article in the Microsoft
   Knowledge Base:

<PRE></PRE>      TITLE     : ACC95: How to Add Former MSACC20.INI ODBC Section to
                  Registry

</PRE><P><LI>Check with the system administrator to see if the SQL database server
   is up, available for transactions, and operating correctly.

<P><LI>Reinstall ODBC after restarting the server and renaming the ODBC.DLL,
   DBNMP3.DLL, and SQLSRVR.DLL files.
