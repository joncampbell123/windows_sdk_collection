The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access versions 1.0, 1.1, 2.0, 7.0, 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Novice: Requires knowledge of the user interface on single-user computers.
<P>
When you try to open a table in Design view in Microsoft Access 7.0 or 97,
you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   You can't open the table '&lt;tablename&gt;' for modification.

</PRE>In Microsoft Access 1.x and 2.0, you may receive the following error
message:
<P>
<PRE>   Can't open table '&lt;table name&gt;' for modifications. Open it read-only?

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This error message occurs when you attempt to open a table in Design view
when the table is the record source for a form or report, and one of the
following conditions is also true:

<UL><LI>A report is open in Print Preview or a form is open in Form
   view that has the same record source or is based on a query
   with the same record source.

<LI>A form is opened in Form view first, and then switched to Design
   view.

<LI>A report is opened in Design view, then switched to Print Preview,
   and then switched back to Design view. (You cannot switch to Design
   view if you opened the report in Print Preview first.) This message
   does not occur when you open the form or report in Design view first
   (without ever switching to Form view or Print Preview), and then open
   the table in Design view.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
You must close the Form or Report window to be able to open the table in
Design view to make changes.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
