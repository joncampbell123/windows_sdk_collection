The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access 97
<LI>Microsoft Office Developer Edition 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multiuser skills.
<P>
When synchronizing two replicas over the Internet, you may receive the
following message:
<P>
<PRE>   Either the Internet is very slow OR there is some problem in the
   replication manager setup on the internet server machine.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs when the Internet server you are trying to synchronize
with is the same computer from which you initiate the synchronization.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
There are two workarounds.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1</h3>
 
<P>
Initiate the synchronization from another computer.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 2</h3>
 
<P>
In the Synchronize Now dialog box, synchronize with a member of the replica
set on a local or wide-area network instead of with a member of the replica
set on the Internet.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Office 97
Developer Edition Tools. We are researching this problem and will post
new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
NOTE: The following steps assume that you have installed Microsoft Access
97 on your Internet server and that you have installed and configured
Microsoft Replication Manager 3.5 on your Internet server to synchronize
database replicas over the Internet.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start Microsoft Access 97 and create a new database on your Internet
    server.

<P><LI>Create a new table with one field.

<P><LI>Close and save the table as Table1.

<P><LI>Convert the database to a Design Master.

<P><LI>Manage the Design Master with Microsoft Replication Manager 3.5; this
    assigns an Internet address to the Design Master.

<P><LI>Create a replica from the Design Master, and place it on the same
    Internet server as the Design Master. Do not manage the replica with
    Microsoft Replication Manager.

<P><LI>Start Microsoft Access 97 on your Internet server and open the replica.

<P><LI>Add a new record to the table created in step 2, and then close the
    table.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, point to Replication, and then click Synchronize
    Now.

<P><LI>In the Synchronize Now dialog box, select "A member of the replica set
    on the Internet," and then click OK.

<P><LI>In the Synchronize Database dialog box, select the Internet server that
    your replica set resides on, select the "Send and Receive Changes"
    option, and then click Synchronize. Note that you receive the error:
<P>
      Either the Internet is very slow OR there is some problem in the
      replication manager setup on the Internet server machine.
