<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
This article describes how to add blank lines between the printed lines on
a report. You can use this method to add a blank line after a set number of
lines. For example, you could use this method to add a blank line after
every five lines of data in your report.
<P>
NOTE: This article explains a technique demonstrated in the sample
files, RptSampl.exe (for Microsoft Access for Windows 95 version 7.0)
and RptSmp97.exe (for Microsoft Access 97). For information about how
to obtain these sample files, please see the following articles in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : ACC97: Microsoft Access 97 Sample Reports Available on MSL

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
CAUTION: Following the steps in this example will modify the sample
database Northwind.mdb. You may want to back up the Northwind.mdb file and
perform these steps on a copy of the database.
<P>
To add a blank line after every five lines in a report, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Open the sample database Northwind.mdb and create a new report based on
    the Employees table.

<P><LI>In the New Report dialog box, click Report Wizards, click the Employees
    Table, and then click OK.

<P><LI>In the Available Fields box, select EmployeeID, and then click
    the "&gt;" button. Repeat this step for the LastName, FirstName, and
    BirthDate fields, and then click Next.

<P><LI>Select BirthDate as the primary group level, click the "&gt;" button,
    and then click Next.

<P><LI>Select LastName as the field to establish sort order in Field 1, and
    then click Next.

<P><LI>In the "How would you like to Lay out your Report?" dialog box,
    click Next.

<P><LI>In the "What Style would you like?" dialog box, click Next.

<P><LI>In the "What Title would you like for your Report?" dialog box, type
    Employee Birthdays, and then click Finish.

<P><LI>View the new report in Design view.

<P><LI>On the View menu, click Code.

<P><LI>Type the following lines in the module's Declarations section:
<P>
       Option Compare Database
       ' This code declares the cLines variable as an integer, and the
       ' cMaxLine constant as five. You can set the cMaxLine constant
       ' to insert a blank line after as many lines as you want. For
       ' example, to add a blank line after every eight lines in the
       ' report, set cMaxLine=8.
       Dim cLines As Integer
       Const cMaxLine=5

<P><LI>In the Object box of the code module, select Report. In the Procedure
    box of the code module, select Open. Type the following procedure:
<P>
       Private Sub Report_Open (Cancel As Integer)
<PRE>          'This code initializes the cLines variable to zero.
          cLines = 0
       End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>In the Object box, select Detail. The Procedure box will change to
    Format. Type the following procedure:
<P>
       Private Sub Detail_Format (Cancel As Integer, FormatCount As _
<PRE>              Integer)
       ' This code adds a blank line by setting the NextRecord and
       ' PrintSection properties.
         If cLines Mod (cMaxLine+1) = 0 Then
            Me.NextRecord = False
            Me.PrintSection = False
         End If
         cLines = cLines + 1
       End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>Close the module, and then preview the report. Note that there is a
    blank line in the report after every five lines of detail.
