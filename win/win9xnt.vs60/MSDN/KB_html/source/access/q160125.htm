<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Novice: Requires knowledge of the user interface on single-user computers.
<P>
This article explains why your Microsoft Access databases can change in
size when you convert them from an earlier version to Microsoft Access 7.0
or 97.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you convert or open a Microsoft Access 1.x or 2.0 database in
Microsoft Access 7.0 or 97, Microsoft Access converts your Access Basic
code to Visual Basic for Applications code. This can change the size of
your database for the following reasons.
<P>
<P><h3>The MSysModules2 Table</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft Access 97 creates and stores separate copies of your form
modules, report modules, and global modules in a system table called
MSysModules2 (or MSysModules in version 7.0). This table can double the
size of your modules, depending on the amount of code the database
contains. The table is created whether you convert your database or just
open it in Microsoft Access 7.0 or 97. If you open your Microsoft Access
1.x or 2.0 database in both Microsoft Access 7.0 and Microsoft Access 97,
the MSysModules and MSysModules2 tables are created, which can result in a
large increase in your database.
<P>
Microsoft Access 97 introduces a new feature called lightweight objects. A
lightweight object is one that does not have a code module attached to it,
so it does not require any space in the MSysModules2 table. If a form or
report in your Microsoft Access 1.x or 2.0 database does not contain any
Access Basic code, Microsoft Access 97 converts it to a lightweight object
when you convert your database. This can help to decrease the size of your
database. Note that lightweight objects are only created when you convert
your database, and not if you just open it in Microsoft Access 97.
<P>
<P><h3>Compiled Code</h3>
 
<P>
To improve performance, Microsoft Access 7.0 and 97 store Visual Basic for
Applications modules in a compiled state. Microsoft Access 1.x and 2.0
store Access Basic modules in an uncompiled state. This difference
increases the size of your converted database because the database contains
both the editable source code and the compiled code.
<P>
Microsoft Access 97 introduces a new feature called MDE files. An MDE file
is a database from which all editable source code has been removed and only
the compiled code remains. This results in a smaller database.
<P>
To find out more about how to use MDE files in Microsoft Access 97, search
the Help Index for "MDE files," or ask the Microsoft Access 97 Office
Assistant.
<P>
<P><h3>Compacting Your Database After Conversion</h3>
 
<P>
The conversion process itself causes your database to increase in size
because all of the database objects are modified. The same behavior occurs
when you delete records or modify the design of objects in your database.
To decrease the size of your database, you can run the Compact Database
command.
<P>
In Microsoft Access 97, the conversion utility compacts your database as
part of the process, which helps decrease the size of the database.
However, Microsoft Access 7.0 does not automatically compact your database
after it is converted; you must run the Compact Database command manually
to decrease the size of the converted database.
<P>

"converting databases," or ask the Microsoft Access 97 Office Assistant.

Index for "compacting databases," or ask the Microsoft Access 97 Office
Assistant.
