The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access version 7.0, 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
When you start Microsoft Access on a network workstation, you may receive
the following error messages:
<P>
<PRE>   Can't update. Database or object is read only.

   -and-

   A system error occurred, or there isn't enough free memory to start
   Microsoft Access. Close unneeded programs and try again.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Access was installed on a network server with the Workdir folder
set to Read-Only.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Make sure that all Microsoft Access users have at least Read and Write
privileges for the Workdir folder. The first user to run the Microsoft
Access Wizards also needs Create privileges so that Microsoft Access can
create the associated .ldb files. After the .ldb files are created, the
users will no longer require Create privileges unless any of the users have
Delete privileges for the Workdir folder. This is because of the new
automatic creation and deletion behavior of .ldb files in Microsoft Access.
<P>
For more information about .ldb files in Microsoft Access 95 and Microsoft
Access 97, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../access/q136128.htm">Q136128</A></B>
   TITLE     : ACC: Introduction to .ldb Files (95/97)

</PRE>If you are using Microsoft FastTips, you can order item number <B><A href="../access/q136128.htm">Q136128</A></B> by
selecting the FastTips Technical Library from the FastTips Main Menu.
<P>
If your operating system does not allow you to have a single read/write
folder of a read-only shared folder, make the Microsoft Access program
folder read/write, but make all the files in the Microsoft Access program
folders (except for the Workdir folder) read-only.
<P>
For more information about privileges needed for the Workdir folder, refer
to the Netwrk8.txt file, which is located in the Office folder on the
Microsoft Office 97 Service Release 1 CD. This file is also copied to
the server during an administrative installation of Microsoft Office 97
Service Release 1.
<P>
You can find the contents of Netwrk8.txt in the following Microsoft
Knowledge Base article:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../office/q172856.htm">Q172856</A></B>
   TITLE     : OFF97: Contents of the Enterprise Netwrk8.txt Readme File

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you start Microsoft Access on a network workstation, you must have
Write privileges for the following files in the Workdir folder on the
server.
<P>
For more information about permissions needed by the Workdir folder,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../office/q167172.htm">Q167172</A></B>
   TITLE     : OFF97: Workdir Needs Add'l Permissions for Workstation
               Install

</PRE><h3>In Microsoft Access 97</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   System.mdw, Wizard.srg, Wzcnf80.mda, Wzdat80.mdt, Wzlib80.mde,
   Wzmain80.mde, and Wztool80.mde (the wizard files)

</PRE><h3>In Microsoft Access 95</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   System.mdw, Wd95acc.tlb, Wzdat70.mdt, Wzlib70.mda, Wzmain70.mda,
   and Wztool.mda (the wizard files)

</PRE>NOTE: The Utility.mda file is installed in the parent folder of the Workdir
folder (whether this is an Office install or Microsoft Access install) and
should be read-only.
<P>
To verify that the problem you are having is caused by incorrect privileges
for the Workdir folder, try using a supervisory-level logon to start
Microsoft Access on the workstation.
