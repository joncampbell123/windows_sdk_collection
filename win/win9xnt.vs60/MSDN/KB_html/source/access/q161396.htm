<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Novice: Requires knowledge of the user interface on single-user computers.
<P>
Microsoft Office 97 introduces a new type of Help component called the
Office Assistant, which is a feature that is shared by all Microsoft Office
programs. The Office Assistant is an interactive Help utility that enables
you to ask questions about a program, just as you might ask questions of
another person. Additionally, the Office Assistant can offer tips and
suggestions while you work to help you accomplish your tasks more
effectively.
<P>
However, you may not want to use the Office Assistant in your application,
or you may want to change the settings for this feature. This article
contains tips for customizing the Office Assistant to meet your needs.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Customizing the Office Assistant</h3>
 
<P>
If you want to hide the Office Assistant, choose a different Office
Assistant character, or make changes to the settings of the Office
Assistant, you can invoke the Office Assistant shortcut menu. To open the
shortcut menu, using the right mouse button (right-click), click the Office
Assistant. You can set the following options from the shortcut menu:

<UL><LI>You can hide the Office Assistant by clicking Hide Assistant.

<LI>You can make the Office Assistant interact by clicking Animate!

<LI>You can change the Office Assistant character by clicking Choose
   Assistant.

<LI>You can change features of the Office Assistant, specify the type of
   tips you want displayed, or reset your tips, by clicking Options.
<P>
   NOTE: You can also invoke the Office Assistant Options by clicking
   Options in the Office Assistant balloon any time the Assistant is
   active.
<P>
</UL>If you hide the Assistant, you can view it at any time by pressing the F1
key or by clicking the Office Assistant button on the toolbar.
<P>
<P><h3>Removing the Office Assistant</h3>
 
<P>
The Office Assistant is a shared component in Microsoft Office 97. Once you
have installed it, you cannot remove it using the Setup program. If you do
not want to use the Office Assistant, consider hiding it instead of
removing it, so that it will be available if you ever do want to use it.
<P>
If you must disable the Office Assistant, move all of the Actor files
(*.act) in the \Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\Actors folder to a
backup folder on your hard drive. The first time you use Help after doing
this, you may notice that it takes longer to open Help. After the first
time, however, Help responds as it normally would.
<P>
To enable the Office Assistant again, move the Actor files from the backup
folder to the \Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\Actors folder.
<P>
