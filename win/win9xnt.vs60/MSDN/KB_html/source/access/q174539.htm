The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
In Microsoft Access 97, if you use the Filter By Form feature, and you are
searching for words that start with "is" (without the quotation marks), you
must use quotation marks around the string. If you type "is*" (without the
quotation marks), the filter returns the following message:
<P>
<PRE>  You can use the Is operator only in an expression with Null or Not Null.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Access assumes that when you use "is" (without the quotation
marks), you are referring to Is Null or Is Not Null.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To search for words that start with "is," you must surround the entire
string with quotation marks including any wild card characters that you are
using. For example, you would type "is*" (with the quotation marks) in the
Filter For box.
