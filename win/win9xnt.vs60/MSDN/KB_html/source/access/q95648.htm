The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access versions 1.0, 1.1, 2.0, 7.0, 97
</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Novice: Requires knowledge of the user interface on single-user computers.
<P>
Form and report sections have a KeepTogether property that you can set
to Yes or No. The KeepTogether property setting for sections determines
whether Microsoft Access prints the controls located in that section on a
single page or on more than one page.
<P>
The section's KeepTogether property affects the controls located in
that section for a single record.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If the KeepTogether property is set to Yes, Microsoft Access begins
printing the controls located in that section at the top of the next page
if it cannot print all of the controls on the current page. If it is set to
No, Microsoft Access prints as many controls as it can on the current page
and continues printing them on the next page.
<P>
If all the controls in a section require more than one page for a single
record, Microsoft Access continues printing on a second page, regardless of
the KeepTogether setting.
<P>
For example, say the detail section of a report has its KeepTogether
property set to Yes and all the controls in that section will not fit on
the current printed page. In this case, Microsoft Access prints none of the
controls on the current page. Instead, it begins printing the controls at
the top of the next page. If it turns out the section requires more than a
single page, Microsoft Access ignores the KeepTogether property value and
continues printing the controls at the top of the next page.
<P>
The KeepTogether property affects the controls in a form or report section
for a single record -- not groups of records. The KeepTogether property
will not keep all the grouped records together, and it will not avoid the
problem of abandoned group headers left on the bottom of a printed page.
<P>
In Microsoft Access 7.0 and 97, there is a RepeatSection property that is
useful for specifying whether a group header is repeated on the next page
or column when a group spans more than one page or when a column is
desired. The default setting is No so that the group header isn't repeated.
<P>

Index for "KeepTogether property - Sections," or ask the Microsoft Access
97 Office Assistant.
