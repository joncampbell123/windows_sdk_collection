The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access versions 1.1, 2.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you have a query based on an attached Oracle synonym that has a sort on
a column name, and the owner of the synonym has read-only permissions on
the table on which the synonym is based, you will receive the error
messages:
<P>
<PRE>   ODBC - call failed

   -and-

   [PageAhead][ODBC Oracle Driver][Oracle OCI]ORA-00904: invalid
   column name. [#904]

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This error occurs because the owner of the synonym has read-only
permissions on the Oracle table on which the synonym is based.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
There are four ways to correct this problem:

<UL><LI>Create a Public synonym in Oracle.

<LI>In Microsoft Access, attach directly to the table on which the
   synonym is based.

<LI>In Oracle, assign the owner of the synonym permissions greater
   than read-only.

<LI>In Microsoft Access, remove the "order by" clause from the
   query.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following is an example of an SQL statement that will cause this
error:
<P>
<PRE>   SELECT * FROM &lt;owner&gt;.&lt;synonym_name&gt;
      ORDER BY &lt;owner&gt;.&lt;synonym_name&gt;.&lt;column_name&gt;

</PRE>Note that the same errors will occur if this command is issued in SQL*DBA
or SQL*PLUS, which are Oracle's interface tools. If you remove the ORDER BY
clause, the statement will run. The statement will run with the ORDER BY
clause if you remove the &lt;owner&gt;. clause instead. The statement will run
with all the clauses included if you increase the owner's permissions on
the table on which the query is based.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>In Oracle, create a table. Assign all permissions on the table to user
   A, and read-only permissions to user B.

<P><LI>Log into Oracle as user A. Create synonym A based on the new table.

<P><LI>Log into Oracle as user B. Create synonym B based on the new table.

<P><LI>Start Microsoft Access. Attach synonym A with user A's login account.
   Create a query based on synonym A with a sort on one of the columns.

<P><LI>Run the query. Note that the query runs correctly.

<P><LI>Attach synonym B with user B's login account. Create a query based on
   synonym B with a sort on one of the columns.

<P><LI>Run the query. The error messages stated above will occur.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: You can reproduce this behavior in Oracle's SQL*DBA as well. To do
so, connect as user A and issue the following command:
<P>
<PRE>  SELECT * FROM userA.synonymA ORDER BY userA.synonymA.column1;

</PRE></OL>Note that the command runs correctly. Next, connect as user B and issue the
following command:
<P>
<PRE>  SELECT * FROM userB.synonymB ORDER BY userB.synonymB.column1;

</PRE>An error message will occur.
