The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access versions 97, 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
When you try to replicate a database on a computer running Microsoft
Windows NT, you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   An application error has occurred
   and an application error log is being generated.

   MSACCESS.exe
   Exception: access violation (0xc0000005), Address: 0x77f7d357

</PRE>When you try to replicate a database on a computer running Microsoft
Windows 95, you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   This program has performed an illegal operation
   and will be shut down.

</PRE>If you click Details, you see the following information:
<P>
<PRE>   MSACCESS.EXE caused a stack fault in module
   KERNEL32.DLL at 0137:bff783df.

</PRE>When you try to replicate a database using Visual C++ and the DAO SDK C++
classes, you may receive the following debugger output:
<P>
<PRE>   Heap block at 114fa58 modified at 114fc60 past requested size of 200

</PRE>These errors occur when you try to replicate a database by using the
Microsoft Access user interface or by using data access objects (DAO) code
in a Visual Basic for Applications procedure.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The computer has more than 128 network shares. As a result, the Microsoft
Replication Library fails while loading and generates one of the errors
described in the "Symptoms" section. The Microsoft Jet database engine
loads this library only when you use replication.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To prevent this problem, either reduce the number of shares or avoid using
Jet replication on the computer.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Access versions
7.0 and 97. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start Microsoft Access on a computer that has more that 128 network
   shares.

<P><LI>Create a new blank database.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, point to Replication, and then click Create Replica.

<P><LI>When prompted to close the database, click Yes.

<P><LI>When prompted to create a backup of the database, click No.

<P><LI>Note that after the status indicator appears with the message
   "Converting Database to Design Master," you receive one of the errors
   described in the "Symptoms" section.
