The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multiuser skills.
<P>
When you try to view the custom property sheet of an ActiveX control by
double-clicking it in Design view of a Microsoft Access form, you may
receive one of the following error messages:
<P>
<PRE>   A problem occurred while Microsoft Access was communicating with the
   OLE server.

   -or-

   This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down.
   If the problem persists, contact the program vendor.

</PRE>When you click the Details button, you receive the following message:
<P>
<PRE>   MSACCESS caused and invalid page fault in module &lt;ActiveX Control&gt;.OCX

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The primary verb of the ActiveX control is requesting that Microsoft
Access activate it in place. However, Microsoft Access only supports
in-place activation of objects in Form view. Microsoft Access does not
allow in-place activation of objects in Design view.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
There are two methods that you can use to view the property sheet of
the ActiveX control.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Click the ActiveX control so that it is the selected control.

<P><LI>On the Edit menu, point to &lt;ActiveX Control&gt; Control Object, and then
   click &lt;ActiveX Control&gt; Control Properties.
<P>
</OL><h3>Method 2</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Click the ActiveX control so that it is the selected control.

<P><LI>Using the right mouse button, click the ActiveX control to open its
   shortcut menu.

<P><LI>Point to &lt;ActiveX Control&gt; Control Object, and then click &lt;ActiveX
   Control&gt; Control Properties.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Many users double-click an ActiveX control in Form Design view to view the
control's custom property sheet. However, double-clicking any OLE object,
such as an ActiveX control, causes Microsoft Access to invoke the object's
primary verb.
<P>
The primary verb for most ActiveX controls is Properties. However, the
primary verb for some ActiveX controls is Edit, which means it is
requesting that the container application activate it in place.
<P>
Whether or not you receive an invalid page fault depends on how robust the
ActiveX control is, and how it responds to not being activated in-place by
the client application.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>If it is not already installed, install the Microsoft ActiveMovie
   Control. You can install it by running Amovie.exe from the
   ValuPack\AMovie folder on your Microsoft Office 97 Professional
   Edition compact disc.

<P><LI>Start Microsoft Access and open the sample database Northwind.mdb.

<P><LI>Open a new form not based on any table or query in Design view.

<P><LI>On the Insert menu, click ActiveX Control.

<P><LI>Select ActiveMovie Control Object, and then click OK. This will insert
   the Microsoft ActiveMovie control on your form.

<P><LI>Double-click the ActiveMovie Control. Note that you receive the error "A
   problem occurred while Microsoft Access was communicating with the OLE
   server."
