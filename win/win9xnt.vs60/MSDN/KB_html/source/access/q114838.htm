The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access versions 2.0, 7.0, 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
When you try to delete the user Admin, you may receive the following error
message:
<P>
<PRE>   Can't perform this operation

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Access you cannot delete any of the default user or group
accounts. The default accounts are as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   In Microsoft Access 7.0 and 97  (Admin, User, Admins and Users)

   In Microsoft Access version 2.0 (Admin, Guest, Admins, Guests,
   and Users).

</PRE><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
It is not necessary to delete the default users and groups. Instead, you
can create alternate users and groups, and then disable the default users
and groups.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
NOTE: The following steps secure the sample database Northwind.mdb (or
NWIND.MDB in version 2.0.) Before beginning these steps, make a backup of
both the Northwind.mdb and the System.mdw files (or the NWIND.MDB and the
SYSTEM.MDA files in version 2.0)
<P>
<P><h3>In Microsoft Access 97</h3>
 
<P>
To secure the Northwind.mdb, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Join a secure workgroup or create a new workgroup. For information
   about how to do this, search for "Security, workgroups" using the
   Microsoft Access 97 Help Index.

<P><LI>Activate the Logon screen. For information about how to do this, search
   for "Security, logon procedures" using the Microsoft Access 97 Help
   Index.

<P><LI>Create an administrator account. For information about how to do this,
   search for "Security, permissions" using the Microsoft Access 97 Help
   Index.

<P><LI>Quit Microsoft Access and restart it, logging in with the new
   administrator account when prompted for a logon name.

<P><LI>Remove the Admin user from the Admins group. On the Tools menu, point
   to Security, and then click User And Group Accounts on the menu that
   appears. On the User's tab, select Admin as the user name and select
   Admins as the group. Click Remove, and then click OK.

<P><LI>Open the sample database Northwind.mdb. On the Tools menu, point to
   Security, and then click User-Level Security Wizard on the menu that
   appears. Follow the instructions in the wizard. For more information
   about the Security Wizard, search for "Security Wizard" using the
   Microsoft Access 97 Help Topics.
<P>
   NOTE: After following these steps, the only users who can gain access
   to the Northwind.mdb are those users who are members of the Admins
   group. You will have to grant permissions to other users or groups as
   you create them.
<P>
</OL><h3>In Microsoft Access Version 2.0</h3>
 
<P>
To secure the NWIND.MDB, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Create a new workgroup or join a secured workgroup by using the
   Workgroup Administrator. For more information about how to do this,
   search for "workgroup," and then "Creating or Joining a Microsoft
   Access Workgroup" using the Microsoft Access 2.0 Help menu.

<P><LI>Open the sample database NWIND.MDB.

<P><LI>Create an administrative user by adding the new user to the Admins
   group. To do this, click Users on the Security menu, and then click
   New. After creating an administrative user, click Admins under
   Available groups, click Add, and then Click Close.

<P><LI>Add a password to the Admin user by clicking the Change Password option
   on the Security menu.

<P><LI>Quit Microsoft Access and restart it. Log in as the new user when
   prompted for a logon name.

<P><LI>Open NWIND.MDB again and click the Users option on the Security
   menu. Remove the Admin user from the Admins group, leaving the Admin
   user in the Users group.

<P><LI>Remove the permissions of the users and the Users group by clicking
   Permissions on the Security menu. Make sure that there are no
   permissions checked for the users group, the user "Guest" and the user
   "Admin" for either the existing objects or new objects.

<P><LI>Change the ownership of the database objects to your administrative
   user. Do this by either creating a new database, selecting Import
   Manager from the Add-ins option on the File menu, or clicking the
   "Change Owner" option on the Security menu. Change the ownership of
   each object manually.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: Step 8 is optional as long as you do not create any databases or
database objects while logged in as the Admin user. You may want to
assign the Admin user a unique password so that you can log in as
another user and to keep others from logging in as the Admin user on
the SYSTEM.MDA that was used to create the database.
