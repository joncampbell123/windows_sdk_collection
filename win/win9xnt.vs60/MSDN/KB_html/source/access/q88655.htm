<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how Microsoft Access uses connections to SQL Server
and how application developers can minimize the use of these connections.
<P>
This article assumes the you are highly knowledgeable about the low-
level interaction between applications and SQL Server.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The conventional application that accesses a server does it in a simple
single-tasking manner, requiring a single connection to the server.
Microsoft Access, however, is not a typical conventional server front-end.
Many of its features, including updatable views (dynasets), joins between
local and server data, execution of complex expressions that the server
may not be able to handle, and seamless transition from one server to
another, require Microsoft Access to obtain more connections than a
conventional front-end.
<P>
Although some servers, such as Microsoft SQL Server, are not stingy giving
out connections, there are other servers that place strict limits on the
number of connections an application can open. (In some installations, SQL
Server also places absolute restrictions on connections.) When designing
applications for the more restrictive servers, it is important to
understand how Microsoft Access uses connections.
<P>
Connections are opened by Microsoft Access when it needs to execute a
query on the server (which it must do to build dynasets or static views),
obtain the data in a dynaset, or update data on the server. These
connections can be categorized into two types: connections needed to build
the working set and connections needed to service dynasets.
<P>
Both types of views available in Microsoft Access (static views and
dynasets) are built by executing a query (called a "local" query to
differentiate it from other types of queries discussed in this article).
This local query processes Microsoft Access and foreign ISAM data (both
locally and file server based) and remote server data, and pulls it into a
temporary table that represents the view. To build static views, the
actual data is stored in the temporary table, whereas to build dynasets,
pointers to the actual data are stored.
<P>
When server data is included in the local query, execution of the query
involves asking the server (or servers) for data, which is done by opening
connections and sending queries to the server. Each query sent to the
server requires that a connection be opened. If more than one query is to
be sent to the server, a single connection could be used and the queries
executed serially. However, this would typically require the user to wait
for all of the server queries to complete before any data would appear.
Therefore, Microsoft Access executes the server queries in parallel,
requiring a connection for each.
<P>
The number of queries sent to a server may not be entirely obvious.
Much of the time, access to all of the remote base tables will be combined
into a single query, if all of the base tables reside on the same server.
In the worst case, each server base table referenced by the local query
will require a connection. There are several factors that could compel
Microsoft Access to split a local query into several server queries:

<UL><LI>If server data is joined to data from other sources (that is,
   local, foreign ISAM, and other servers), the Microsoft Access
   optimizer may decide that it is more efficient not to combine
   references to two tables on the same server into a single query.
   For example, if the Customers and Order Items tables are on a server
   and the Orders table is in a local Microsoft Access database, then it
   is likely that the optimizer will decide to ask for the Customers and
   Order Items tables separately, rather than asking for the cross-product
   of the two, to join to the Orders table. As you can tell from this
   example, this is unlikely to happen in a real scenario.

<LI>If an expression involved in the query cannot be executed on the
   server (either because the server does not support it or because the
   semantics provided by the server differ greatly from those provided
   by Microsoft Access), the expression will be executed locally. An
   extreme example of this is a local query with a restriction that calls
   a user-defined function. Although this may not require separating
   remote tables into separate server queries, it will if the
   expression that is not executable on the server is somehow involved
   with the join between the two tables. Note that in Microsoft Access,
   expressions containing a conjunction that can be executed on the
   server will be executed locally in their entirety. These
   expressions are not split to execute part locally and part on the
   server.

<LI>The parameters used to attach tables on the same server to a Microsoft
   Access database differ. For example, if two tables are in different
   databases, or if they are being accessed using different user names
   and passwords, then separate connections will be required to
   execute a local query referencing both of them.
<P>
   Connections opened in the execution of a local query will be kept
   open until the working set containing the queries is closed.
<P>
   Connections are also opened in support of dynasets. But, unlike the
   server queries sent during the execution of a local query, the
   queries sent to the server in support of a dynaset are executed
   entirely and very quickly. This is because they are used to fill
   portions of the dynaset with data (given the pointers to the data
   provided by the local query), and to do updates to the server.
   Therefore, Microsoft Access opens only one connection per attached
   server, provided that the link attachment information is the same
   for each server tables.
<P>
</UL>As a result of the above rules, when Microsoft Access executes a query, it
typically requires only one (for a static view) or two (for a dynaset)
connection. This does not represent an extravagant use of server
connections, but good applications could involve the execution of many
Microsoft Access queries that could occupy many server connections very
quickly. There are some steps the designer can take to minimize the use
of connections:

<UL><LI>Reduce the number of queries required by the application. Each
   form, subform, data sheet, report, and list box requires a query,
   and each of these queries that accesses server data will require at
   least one or two connections. Close forms, data sheets, and reports
   as soon as they are no longer needed. Also, bring server data to a
   local database where practical, especially for filling list boxes.

<LI>Avoid queries that join server data to local data to server data,
   as described above. These types of queries will most likely be
   executed using a connection for each server table.

<LI>Avoid expressions that must be executed locally when joining server
   data together. Each of the tables involved with such a join
   expression, or that is restricted by a WHERE clause containing such
   an expression, will need to be executed locally. It should be noted
   that separating expressions into separate query objects will not
   help alleviate this problem, because the optimizer combines all
   query objects in a single query before execution for efficiency.

<LI>Use static working sets when seeing other users' changes, or when
   making changes yourself is not required. This will avoid the
   connections needed to support dynasets.
<P>
</UL>With an understanding of how Microsoft Access uses connections, and with
prudent application design, you should not run out of server connections.
