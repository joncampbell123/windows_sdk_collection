 1. Q. Why is the data sorted in my query but not in my report?

    A. Reports create their own internal queries to present the data.
       If you want to have the data in your report presented in a
       particular order, you must explicitly set the sort order in the
       Sorting And Grouping dialog box. To do this, open the report in
       Design view, then choose Sorting And Grouping from the View
       menu.

 2. Q. How can I keep a group of records together on a report?

    A. The new KeepTogether property for groups in Microsoft Access
       version 2.0 gives you the ability to keep groups of like
       information together. This property is available in the Sorting
       And Grouping dialog box for reports. Using this property, you
       can keep an entire group together (including the group header,
       all records, and the group footer), or keep the group header
       with the first record.

       For more information about sorting and grouping, please see the
       Microsoft Access "User's Guide," version 2.0, Chapter 22,
       "Sorting and Grouping Data."

 3. Q. Why is every other page of my report blank, and how can I
       correct this problem?

    A. This problem occurs when the total width of your report exceeds
       the width of the paper specified in the Print Setup dialog box.
       For example, blank pages print if your report form is 8 inches
       wide and your left and right margins are 1 inch wide for a
       total width of 10 inches, and if the paper size specified in
       the Print Setup dialog box is only 8.5 inches wide.

       Using this example, if controls (such as text boxes) extend
       beyond 8.5 inches, the controls are printed on a second page.
       Otherwise, you receive a warning message stating that some
       pages may be blank. Blank pages generated after the warning are
       not counted in the total pages of your report.

       For additional information about preventing blank pages, you
       can order item number <B><A href="../access/q95920.htm">Q95920</A></B> by selecting the FastTips
       Technical Library option from the FastTips Main Menu.

 4. Q. What is an event procedure? Can I still call an Access
       Basic function from my form or report?

    A. Event procedures are Access Basic functions that respond to
       events (such as a mouse click) that occur on forms and reports.
       Event procedures are stored in form or report modules attached
       to the form or report, and are incorporated into the form or
       report's design structure. You can also call an Access Basic
       function stored in a separate module from an event property.

       For more information about event procedures, order the fax or
       mail copy of this script.

        - Event procedures are private procedures--only the form or
          report to which an event procedure is connected can call or
          use that event procedure. If you want another form or report
          to use the same procedure, make the procedure a global
          function by storing it in a module. Functions stored in
          modules are available to all forms and reports.

        - Since event procedures are private, or locally scoped, you
          can use the Me property to refer to the form or report,
          rather than using the full syntax (such as Forms![form
          name]...) to refer to the form or report.

        - Form and report modules are loaded only when the form or
          report is open. If you want to compile the procedure or
          search in the module, you must first open the form or
          report.

       To call an Access Basic function from a property, enter the
       following in the property:

          =MyFunctionName()

       NOTE: The equal sign and parentheses are required.

       To create an event procedure, choose the Build button in the
       property sheet, choose the Code Builder, and write the code for
       that event. When you complete and close the code, you will see
       [Event Procedure] displayed in the property sheet, which
       indicates that the event has code written for it.

       For more information about writing and using event procedures,
       see the Microsoft Access "Building Applications" manual,
       version 2.0, Chapter 3, "Introduction to Access Basic," and
       Chapter 5, "Access Basic Fundamentals."

 5. Q. How can I print a page number that includes the full
       number of pages in the report on each page of a report?

    A. You can use the Page and the Pages properties to create a "Page
       X of Y" expression. The following example, used as a text box's
       ControlSource property, will print a "Page X of Y" page number
       on each page of the report:

          ="Page " &amp; Page &amp; " of " &amp; Pages

 6. Q. Why do I get the message "#Error" in some controls on my
       form or report? How do I reference a control on a subform or
       subreport?

    A. Microsoft Access displays the "#Error" message in a field or
       text box when it cannot find necessary information, execute an
       expression, or store a value within the field's defined limits.
       "#Error" is not the only possible error message for these
       conditions. For additional information about troubleshooting
       "#Error" messages, you can order item number <B><A href="../access/q112103.htm">Q112103</A></B> by
       selecting the FastTips Technical Library option from the
       FastTips Main Menu.

 7. Q. Do form validation rules override table validation rules?
       When are the validation rules on a form evaluated?

    A. In Microsoft Access 2.0, table validation rules are always
       enforced, no matter how you add or edit data. Form validation
       rules do not override table validation rules, but can be used
       in addition to table validation rules.

       When you enter or edit data in a form and then move the
       insertion point to a different field or record, the form
       validation rule is evaluated first. If the data passes this
       validation test, the table validation is evaluated. Therefore,
       you can use form validation to refine table validation.

       Since validation rules are evaluated only when data is added or
       edited, you may want to use the new Required property to force
       users to enter a value. The Required property prevents users
       from tabbing out of and not changing a field.

       For additional information about the Required property, search
       for "Required" then "Required Property" using the Microsoft
       Access Help menu.

 8. Q. When is it appropriate to use an exclamation point (!)
       versus a period (.) for identifying objects and properties in
       an expression?

    A. Use an exclamation point before anything you specifically name,
       such as the name of a form or a control on a form, and use a
       period before anything Microsoft Access names, such as a
       property.

       In Microsoft Access version 1.x, you can use a period to
       reference a field name, such as "MyTable.Name" to refer to the
       Name field in the table MyTable. If, however, you use this same
       expression in Microsoft Access 2.0, you refer to the Name
       property, rather than the field called Name. To prevent this,
       use "MyTable!Name" in Microsoft Access 2.0.

 9. Q. How do I turn off the ControlWizards?

    A. ControlWizards help you create list boxes, combo boxes, option
       groups, and command buttons. Once you are comfortable working
       with these controls, you may want to turn off the
       ControlWizards instead of having to cancel them each time you
       add one of these controls. To turn off the ControlWizards,
       either choose ControlWizards from the View menu to clear the
       check mark, or choose the ControlWizards button in the toolbox
       to toggle the button off.

10. Q. How can I check for duplicate records immediately after I
       enter a value in a primary key field?

    A. Normally, Microsoft Access does not check the values in primary
       key fields for duplicates until you move to the next record. If
       you want to check for duplicate values immediately after
       entering a value in a primary key field, use a macro in the
       field's AfterUpdate property. The macro should use the
       DLookup() function to check for duplicates and then display an
       appropriate message.

       For additional information about checking for duplicate primary
       keys, you can order item number <B><A href="../access/q102527.htm">Q102527</A></B> by selecting the
       FastTips Technical Library option from the FastTips Main Menu.
