<P>
<P><h3>IMPORTANT: Disable Virus Protection Before Running Setup</h3>
 
<P>
Some virus protection programs, such as VSAFE.COM and Norton Anti-Virus
Autoprotect, can interfere with the Microsoft Office 97 or Microsoft
Access 97 stand-alone version Setup program. If you use a virus protection
program on your computer, please disable it before running Setup. (You can
re-enable the virus protection program after Setup is complete.) Note --
If your virus-detection program starts automatically when you start
Windows, you can disable it by restarting Windows while holding down the
SHIFT key.
<P>
<P><h3>Minimum System Requirements for Microsoft Office 97</h3>
 
<P>
To use Microsoft Office 97, you need:
<UL><LI>Personal or multimedia computer with a 486 or higher processor.
<LI>Microsoft Windows 95 operating system or Windows NT Workstation version
   3.51 with Service Pack 5 or later (will not run on earlier versions).
<LI>For use on Windows 95:  8 MB of memory required to run applications
   individually (12 MB required to run Microsoft Access); more memory may
   be required to run additional applications simultaneously.
<LI>For use on Windows NT Workstation: 16 MB of memory required to run
   applications individually; more memory may be required to run
   additional applications simultaneously.
<LI>(PROFESSIONAL EDITION) 73-191 MB of hard disk space required;
   approximately 121 MB required for typical installation, depending on
   configuration. Use the Office Upgrade Wizard during Setup to maximize
   free disk space.
<LI>(STANDARD EDITION)  60-167 MB of hard disk space required;
   approximately 102 MB required for typical installation, depending on
   configuration. Use the Office Upgrade Wizard during Setup to maximize
   free disk space.
<LI>CD-ROM drive (coupon enclosed for 3.5-inch high-density disks). CD-ROM
   contains additional items such as Microsoft Internet Explorer, extra
   clip art, fonts, .avi files, and sounds not available on 3.5-inch disks.
<LI>VGA or higher-resolution video adapter (Super VGA, 256-color
   recommended).
<LI>Microsoft Mouse, Microsoft IntelliMouse, or compatible pointing device.
<P>

<P>
</UL><h3>Installing Microsoft Office 97 or Microsoft Access 97 on a Network</h3>
 
<P>
For instructions on installing Microsoft Access 97 on a network, see the
Network Readme file located on the CD-ROM at \Office\Netwrk8.txt. For
additional information about network installations, you can obtain a copy
of the Microsoft Office 97 Resource Kit, which is available wherever
computer books are sold or directly from Microsoft Press.
<P>
<P><h3>ODBC Fails When You Upgrade to Windows NT After Installation</h3>
 
<P>
If you install Microsoft Office 97 or Microsoft Access 97 on Windows NT
version 3.51, and then upgrade to Windows NT version 4.0, ODBC data
sources will fail with a message that one of the components is a different
version than the ODBC Driver Manager. To fix this problem, upgrade to
Windows NT version 4.0 before installing Microsoft Office 97 or Microsoft
Access 97. Or, reinstall Microsoft Office 97 or Microsoft Access 97 after
upgrading to Windows NT version 4.0.
<P>
<P><h3>Office 97 ValuPack Contains Additional Clip Art Folder</h3>
 
<P>
In addition to the \ValuPack root folder, The ValuPack contains another
root folder, \Clipart, that contains  clip art and .avi files. If you are
running Microsoft Office 97, Professional Edition, you can add these files
to the Clip Gallery in Microsoft Word.
<P>
<P><h3>AddInPath Registry Entry</h3>
 
<P>
In the registry, there is an entry called AddInPath at
\HKey_Local_Machine\Software\Microsoft\Office\8.0\Access\Wizards.
<P>
Microsoft Access uses this registry key as an alternate location for
add-ins, such as the Import Text and Export Text wizards or ones that you
add through the Add-In Manager. Although the value for the AddInPath is
usually the default path for Msaccess.exe, it can be different, for
example, on development machines, network installations, or CD-ROM
installations.
<P>
<P><h3>Uninstalling Help Doesn't Remove All Help Files</h3>
 
<P>
If you do a complete installation of Microsoft Access and then uninstall
Help by clearing the Help Topics check box in the Setup dialog box,
several Help files (Vbaoff.* and Veenlr.*) in the \Program Files\Common
Files\Microsoft Shared\Vba\ folder will remain on your machine.
<P>
You will need to manually delete these files if you are attempting to save
disk space. If you do not manually delete these files, the keyword Help in
the Module window will still partially work.
<P>
<P><h3>Installing the ODBC SQL Server Driver Help File</h3>
 
<P>
If you do a complete installation (click Custom in the Setup dialog box
and click Select All) of Microsoft Access but only do a Typical
installation of the other Office Professional applications, the ODBC SQL
Server Driver Help file, Drvssrvr.hlp, is not installed. If you then use
Microsoft Access Help and attempt to display the "Use the SQL Server
Driver and the ODBC Help files" topic,  you will not be able to see the
topic and Help may not work.
<P>
To install the ODBC SQL Server Driver Help file, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Start Microsoft Office 97 Professional Setup.

<P><LI>Click Add/Remove.

<P><LI>In the Options box, select Data Access.

<P><LI>Click the Change Option button.

<P><LI>In the Options box, select Database Drivers.

<P><LI>Click the Change Option button.

<P><LI>In the Options box, make sure the box next to Microsoft SQL Server
   Driver is selected.

<P><LI>Click OK.

<P><LI>Click OK again.

<P><LI>Click Continue.
<P>
</OL><h3>Installing Microsoft Access 95 After Installing Microsoft Access 97</h3>
 
<P>
If you do a complete installation of Microsoft Access 97 and then attempt
to do a complete installation of Microsoft Access 95, you may not be able
to complete the installation. For example, if you get the error message
"Unable to load installable ISAM; Can't load mspdox35.dll," you will need
to install the Paradox driver for Microsoft Access 97 before you can
successfully complete the installation of Microsoft Access 95. If this
error occurs with other ISAM drivers, then install the specific driver
that is causing the problem.
<P>
To install any ISAM driver, start the Microsoft Office 97 ValuPack, and go
to the Data Access Pak component.
<P>
<P><h3>Removing a Stand-alone Version of a Microsoft Office 97 Application After</h3>
 
<P><h3>Installing Microsoft Access</h3>
 
<P>
If you install any stand-alone version of a Microsoft Office 97
application along with Microsoft Access 97, and then uninstall the
stand-alone Microsoft Office 97 application, you might not be able to use
Microsoft Access. For example, Microsoft Access closes when you click the
option "Start using Microsoft Access," in the Office Assistant. In this
case, you must reinstall Microsoft Access 97.
<P>
<P><h3>Registration Error Installing Older Data Drivers</h3>
 
<P>
You may get a registration error if you attempt to install an older data
driver such as the Paradox or Lotus 1-2-3 driver after installing
Microsoft Office 97. For instance, installing Microsoft Visual FoxPro
version 5.0 after installing Microsoft Office 97 or Microsoft Access 97
will cause the registration error.
<P>
To work around this, install the new version of the appropriate driver in
the Data Access Pak of the Office 97 ValuPack before installing Visual
FoxPro version 5.0.
<P>
<P><h3>Uninstalling Several Microsoft Products Will Unregister Remote Data Object</h3>
 
<P>
If you have Visual Basic version 4.0 installed on your computer (which uses
Remote Data Object (DAO) version 1.0), and either Microsoft Office 97,
Microsoft Access 97 stand-alone version, Microsoft Excel 97 stand-alone
version, or Visual Basic version 5.0 also installed (which use Remote Data
Object (RDO) version 2.0), if you uninstall Visual Basic version 4.0, RDO
version 2.0 will no longer work in Microsoft Office 97, Microsoft Access 97
stand-alone version, Microsoft Excel 97 stand-alone version, or Visual
Basic version 5.0. If you uninstall Microsoft Office 97, Microsoft Access
97 stand-alone version, Microsoft Excel 97 stand-alone version, or Visual
Basic version 5.0, RDO version 1.0 will no longer work in Visual Basic
version 4.0.
<P>
To work around this, re-register the version of RDO you are using. To do
this, for RDO version 1.0, on the Start menu, click Run, and then type
regsvr32 msrdo32.dll in the Open box. For RDO version 2.0, on the Start
menu, click Run, and then type regsvr32 msrdo20.dll in the Open box.
<P>
<P><h3>Several Northwind Reports Require Arial Narrow Font</h3>
 
<P>
When you preview or print the Catalog, Invoice, and Sales By Category
reports in the Northwind sample database, some of the text will be
truncated if you don't have the Arial Narrow font installed on your
machine. You can install the Arial Narrow as well as other fonts from the
Office 97 ValuPack.
<P>
<P><h3>Working with Sample Databases When You Run Microsoft Access from a CD-ROM</h3>
 
<P>
If you choose the Run From CD-ROM option when you install Microsoft
Access, the sample databases remain in the CD-ROM \Office\Samples folder.
To make changes to the sample databases, copy them to the \Program
Files\Microsoft Office\Office folder on your hard drive. Then, rename
Nwind.mdb to Northwind.mdb and Solution.mdb to Solutions.mdb.
<P>
<P><h3>Web Browser Help File Has Same Name as Internet Explorer Help File</h3>
 
<P>
The Help file for the Web Browser control is in the Office 97 ValuPack, in
a file called Iexplore.hlp. You can open this file directly from the
CD-ROM by double-clicking it. If you copy this file (along with
Iexplore.cnt) to your machine, be careful not to overwrite the Help file
for Internet Explorer version 3.0, which has the same name and is
installed by default in the \Windows\Help directory.
<P>
<P><h3>Keeping an Existing Version of MS Access When You Install MS Office 97</h3>
 
<P>
If you want to keep your existing version of Microsoft Access on your
computer in addition to Microsoft Access 97, you can use the Microsoft
Office Upgrade Wizard located in the \ValuPack\OffClean folder of the
Microsoft Office 97 CD-ROM before you install Microsoft Office 97 or
Microsoft Access 97.
<P>
To start the Microsoft Office Upgrade Wizard, perform one of the following
steps:

<UL><LI>In Windows Explorer or in the File Manager, locate
   \ValuPack\OffClean\OffCln97.exe on the CD-ROM and then double-click
   OffCln97.exe.
<LI>In Microsoft Windows 95 or Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0,
   click Run on the Start menu and type d:\valupack\offclean\offcln97.exe.
<LI>In Microsoft Windows NT version 3.51, click Run on the File menu and
   type d:\valupack\offclean\offcln97.exe.
<P>
</UL>In the Upgrade Wizard, select the Let Me Decide Which Microsoft Office
Applications Will Be Removed option. For more information about
OffCln97.exe, see Microsoft ValuPack Help (Valupk8.hlp) in the \ValuPack
folder on the CD-ROM.
<P>
<P><h3>Removing MS Access 95 After Installing MS Access 97 Unregisters the</h3>
 
<P><h3>Calendar Control</h3>
 
<P>
If you have Microsoft Access 95 installed on your machine, install
Microsoft Office 97, Professional Edition or Microsoft Access 97
stand-alone version, then remove Microsoft Access 95 using Setup, Setup
will remove and unregister the Microsoft Access 95 Calendar control
(Msacal70.ocx), but also inadvertently unregister the Microsoft Access 97
Calendar control (Mscal.ocx).
<P>
To fix the problem, you can re-register the Microsoft Access 97 Calendar
control with the following MS-DOS commands:
<P>
<PRE>   Windows 95: regsvr32.exe \windows\system\mscal.ocx

   Windows NT: regsvr32.exe \windows\system32\mscal.ocx

</PRE></OL><h2>General</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Supported ActiveX Controls</h3>
 
<P>
The following table lists ActiveX controls that have been tested and
verified for Microsoft Access 97.
<P>
There may be additional controls available from the Insert ActiveX Control
dialog box (choose the ActiveX Control command on the Insert menu in form
or report Design view) or the menu displayed from the More Controls button
in the toolbox, but they may not work with Microsoft Access 97. You may
also see several Forms version 2.0 controls on your machine. Although
these ActiveX controls work in Microsoft Access 97, you don't need to use
them because they provide less functionality than the native Microsoft
Access form and report controls.

</PRE><h3>Microsoft Personal Web Server Generates 'Failed to get the expression</h3>
 
<P><h3>service' Error</h3>
 
<P>
If you use Microsoft Personal Web Server on Windows 95 to run a Web
application published by Microsoft Access 97, Personal Web Server may no
longer be able to connect to the Microsoft Access database after the first
50 to 60 queries. The Microsoft Access ODBC driver will return the error
message, "Failed to get the expression service." To fix the problem,
obtain the updated file, Rpcrt4.dll version 4.00.953 (dated 7/23/96 or
later), and replace the existing one on your Windows 95 machine.
<P>
You can find this update in Rpcrtupd.exe, a self-extracting file, on the
following services:

<UL><LI>The Microsoft home page on the Internet, <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/">http://www.microsoft.com/.</A></B> (On
   the Help menu, point to Microsoft On The Web, and then click Microsoft
   Home Page. Click the Support icon. Click Search the Knowledge Base.
   Select Windows 95 And Internet Explorer in step 1, enter kbfile
   rpcrtupd.exe in step 3, and then click GO!. Open the article, and then
   click the button to download the file.)
<LI>Anonymous FTP on the Internet. (Type ftp ftp.microsoft.com, type cd
   softlib/mslfiles, and then type get rpcrtupd.exe.)
<LI>Microsoft Download Service (MSDL). (Dial (425) 936-6735 to connect to
   MSDL, and then download Rpcrtupd.exe.)
<P>
</UL><h3>Changing Browsers Prevents Opening Home Pages in Northwind</h3>
 
<P>
If you remove Microsoft Internet Explorer from your machine, install
Netscape Navigator, and then attempt to open an HTML home page in
Northwind, you will receive the following message: "Unable to open
filename. No program is registered to open this file."
<P>
To fix this problem, run Windows Explorer, select any HTML file, hold down
SHIFT and right-click the HTML file, and then click the Open With command.
Click Netscape from the list of available programs, and then select the
Always Use This Program To Open This Type Of File check box.
<P>
<P><h3>Using ODBC and SQL Server Versions Prior to Version 6.5</h3>
 
<P>
The file Instcat.sql is used with the SQL Server ODBC Driver and is stored
on the CD-ROM in the \Os\System folder. Instcat.sql is an SQL command file
that installs catalog stored procedures on the Microsoft SQL Server. If
you plan on using the SQL Server ODBC Driver included in Microsoft Access
97, and you are running Microsoft SQL Server prior to version 6.5, you
will need to run this command file on the server. For more information,
search for the keyword "Instcat.sql" in the Microsoft SQL Server Books
Online. Note that the functionality provided in the file Instcat.sql is
integrated into SQL Server version 6.5 and later.
<P>
<P><h3>Creating Charts with the Chart Wizard</h3>
 
<P>
When a chart on a form or report displays data that is related to a
specific record on the form or report, you must include the field that
links the chart and the form or report in the query for the chart.
However, if you don't use the linking field as a displayed field on the
chart, the Chart Wizard doesn't add it to the query. To work around this
problem, you can add the linking field to the query for the chart after
you create the chart. For an example, see "Updates to Northwind Sample
Database" in the Documentation section.
<P>
<P><h3>Using the Web Post Option in the Publish to the Web Wizard Causes</h3>
 
<P><h3>Microsoft Access to Fail on Windows NT Version 4.0</h3>
 
<P>
On Windows NT version 4.0, if you run the Publish to the Web Wizard, and
then choose one or more of the Web Post Options, Microsoft Access fails.
Alternatively, you can copy the files created by the Publish to the Web
Wizard using Windows Explorer.
<P>
<P><h2>Jet/ISAM/DAO</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Exchange/Outlook Driver</h3>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Exchange/Outlook driver (Msexch35.dll) is available in the
Office 97 ValuPack. You can use this driver to access data (read-only) in
mail folders and address books stored in the Windows Messaging data store
of Microsoft Exchange and Microsoft Outlook.
<P>
You can use Data Access Objects (DAO) to program the Microsoft
Exchange/Outlook driver. You must install the Messaging Application
Programming Interface (MAPI) on your machine. Also, you must use a new
connection string keyword, MAPILEVEL=, which specifies the path to the
Exchange/Outlook container that is the parent of the folder you want to
access. For example, to link to the Exchange folder named Dave in the Dev
folder under the People folder in the mailbox Mailbox - Sam Smith, define
the connection string as, "Exchange 4.0;MAPILEVEL=Mailbox - Sam
Smith|People\Dev;". Then, use the OpenTable action or method to specify
the table name as "Dave." There is an additional connect string parameter,
TABLETYPE,  you can use to specify either an Address book or a folder,
where 1 = AddressBook and 0 = folder (this is the default).
<P>
To open a Microsoft Exchange/Outlook folder directly, use the OpenDatabase
method and specify values for the following parts: database, options =
True, read-only = True, and a dbname data source. The following code
example uses the OpenDatabase method to open a Microsoft Exchange/Outlook
folder named Barbara and count the number of messages received from a user
named Jim Harris:
<P>
<PRE>   Public Sub OpenExchangeFolder()

      Dim dbsExchange As Database, intCount As Integer

</PRE>Important:

<UL><LI>You cannot directly link to a Microsoft Exchange database that's opened
   exclusively. If you need to work around this, create a back-end
   database containing the link to the Exchange database.
<LI>When you use the OpenDatabase method to open a folder in a Microsoft
   Exchange/Outlook mailbox, you must supply the path and name of an
   existing Microsoft Jet database as the first argument. The Microsoft
   Exchange/Outlook driver creates system tables in this database to store
   information about the structure of the Microsoft Exchange folders being
   accessed, including all the new fields you've appended to these folders.
   It is usually best to create a new, empty Microsoft Jet database for
   this purpose and use this same database each time you want to access
   data in a folder. If you delete this database and use a new one, all the
   information about fields you added to the folders will be lost, and you
   will need to recreate them.
<LI>If the Microsoft Exchange/Outlook folder was created by a client other
   than the Microsoft Exchange/Outlook driver, and not all of the default
   MAPI columns are present, the Microsoft Exchange/Outlook driver will not
   be able to read the folder. For example, if an application is a MAPI
   client and writes a new folder with a number of defined columns other
   than the MAPI default columns, the Microsoft Exchange/Outlook driver
   will not be able to read the folder.
<P>
</UL><h3>Exporting Tables with Numeric Characters in Names to ODBC Sources</h3>
 
<P>
If you use an SQL statement, SELECT/INTO, to export Microsoft Access
tables that have a numeric character as the first character in their names
to an ODBC source, the numeric character is replaced with an underscore
(_). For example, if you export "123Table" to SQL Server, the exported
table will be named "_23Table" in SQL Server.
<P>
<P><h3>Using DAO Version 3.5 in Older OLE Automation Host Applications</h3>
 
<P>
Data Access Objects (DAO) version 3.5 is designed to work with Visual
Basic for Applications version 5.0. Although DAO 3.5 will appear in Office
95 or Visual Basic version 4.0 or earlier reference lists, you can't use
DAO 3.5 in either Microsoft Office 95 or Visual Basic version 4.0 or
earlier.
<P>
<P><h3>RDO Appears in Reference List</h3>
 
<P>
If you have installed ODBCDirect on your machine (in Custom Setup, select
Data Access, click Choose Options, and then select Data Access Objects For
Visual Basic), Remote Data Objects (RDO) appears in the reference list,
but you can't program RDO unless you purchase software, such as Visual
Basic version 5, Enterprise, that explicitly installs it for development.
You can enable the reference to RDO, but you will receive OLE Automation
errors when you use the RDO model in code.
<P>
<P><h3>dbFailOnError No Longer Rolls Back a Transaction</h3>
 
<P>
In previous releases of Data Access Objects (DAO), if you executed SQL
statements, they were internally treated as transactions. If you executed
a statement with the dbFailOnError flag on and the query failed, the
operation was rolled back. For performance reasons, an SQL statement is no
longer treated as a transaction. Therefore, if an SQL query fails in
Microsoft Access, an incomplete operation may occur. If you think an error
may occur, you should explicitly use the statement within a transaction by
using the BeginTrans method and the CommitTrans method. However, note that
explicit transactions may slow query performance.
<P>
<P><h3>Can't Pass a QueryDef Object Name to an OpenRecordset Method Using</h3>
 
<P><h3>ODBCDirect</h3>
 
<P>
When you use ODBCDirect, you cannot open a Recordset object from a
QueryDef method object name. Instead, you should perform the OpenRecordset
method directly from the QueryDef object. This is because QueryDef objects
in ODBCDirect are not permanent objects as they are in a Microsoft Jet
database.
<P>
<P><h3>ODBCDirect: GetRows Error 40035</h3>
 
<P>
You should not use the GetRows method with long value fields. If you use
the GetRows method on an ODBCDirect Recordset object containing long value
fields (Memo or Long Binary), you will get an error variant stored in the
array wherever the long value field should have been. If you read the
array data value, it will be Error 40035 and the data type will be Variant.
<P>
<P><h2>Replication</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Converting Replicated Databases</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft Access 97 can't open a replica created with Microsoft Access 95.
You must convert the Design Master and associated replicas to Microsoft
Access 97, or first open the replica in the version in which it was
created and try again.
<P>
You can enable a Microsoft Access 95 replica to run using Microsoft Access
97. If you open an enabled Microsoft Access 95 replica in Microsoft Access
97 and there is a synchronization pending, synchronization will not occur.
You will be warned that there is a synchronization pending that cannot
occur until the replica is opened and synchronized using Microsoft Access
95.
<P>
<P><h3>Opening a Replica Database Created Through Visual Basic for Applications</h3>
 
<P><h3>Code</h3>
 
<P>
If you make a database replicable using Data Access Objects (DAO) through
Visual Basic for Applications, then move the database to a different
directory without first opening it in Microsoft Access, then you will
receive an error when you try to open the database. If you create a
replica using DAO, then try to open the replica in Microsoft Access before
opening the Design Master, you will also get an error. In both cases, some
commands may not be available when you open the database. To solve this
problem, when you replicate a database using DAO, open the Design Master
in Microsoft Access and synchronize all replicas before moving the Design
Master or opening a replica.
<P>
<P><h2>Conversion and Compatibility</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Converting Expressions in VBA That Use the Line Continuation Character</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft Access 97 sometimes doesn't correctly convert expressions in VBA
that use the line continuation character (_) and displays a compile error
when you try to execute the code. You can correct this problem after you
convert the database to Microsoft Access 97. Open any module in Design
view and then click the Compile And Save All Modules command on the Debug
menu. When Microsoft Access finds an expression that it can't compile,
edit the expression to restore its original syntax.
<P>
<P><h3>Changes to Error Code Numbers</h3>
 
<P>
Some error codes have changed and this may affect existing applications.
For example, when you reference a PaletteSource property of a text box
that doesn't exist, Microsoft Access 95 returned error message 2455,
"Application-defined or object-defined error," but Microsoft Access 97
returns error message 438, "Object doesn't support this property or
method." After you convert your database applications to Microsoft Access
97, some Visual Basic for Application code might not work because you are
no longer trapping the correct error numbers. To fix this problem, test
your converted application and make changes to error events where
necessary so they are trapping the correct error numbers.
<P>
<P><h3>Change in How You Create Custom Menu Bars</h3>
 
<P>
When you create a custom menu bar, you can use the Customize dialog box.
(On the View menu, point to Toolbars and click Customize). If you create a
custom menu bar using the Built-in Menus category on the Commands tab in
the Customize dialog box, any changes you make to the custom menu will
also be made to the built-in menu. Similarly, any changes you make to the
built-in menu will also be made to the custom menu. To avoid making
unintended changes to menus, use the New Menu category instead of the
Built-in Menus category.
<P>
<P><h3>Literal Dates Between the Years 1900 and 1929 May Cause Different Query</h3>
 
<P><h3>Results</h3>
 
<P>
If you have used a literal date specifying the years 1900 through 1929 as
part of your criteria in a query, and you created this query in a version
of a Microsoft Access database prior to Microsoft Access 97, when you
convert the query to Microsoft Access 97, it may return different results.
You may even see different results from the same query if the query is run
under an enabled database. This is caused by the new interpretation of
year dates ending in the digits 00 through 29 as the year 2000.
<P>
To work around this, change the date to cdate("date as string") in the
criteria to force Microsoft Access to accept the correct date.
<P>
<P><h2>Programming and Visual Basic for Applications</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Run-time Error Codes for FollowHyperlink and Follow Methods</h3>
 
<P>
The following table summarizes errors that can occur when you use the
FollowHyperlink method of the Application object or the Follow method of
the Hyperlink object. These error codes explain why you can't connect to a
specific World Wide Web site and occur because of conditions outside your
application.

</PRE><h3>Expression Service Fails with Broken Reference</h3>
 
<P>
If you set a reference from a Microsoft Access 97 database to any project
or type library and the reference is subsequently broken, then your
database may not behave as expected. Your code may not run properly, and
expressions in queries and on forms may also fail. To fix this problem,
either remove the reference or reestablish the reference to the project or
type library.
<P>
<P><h3>Using the RefLibPaths Registry Key to Locate a Moved Project or Type</h3>
 
<P><h3>Library</h3>
 
<P>
If you set a reference to a project or type library from Microsoft Access
and then move the file that contains that project or type library to a
different folder, Microsoft Access will attempt to locate the file and
reestablish the reference. If the \RefLibPaths key exists in the registry,
Microsoft Access will first search there. You must add this key to the
registry and then add the names and locations of any add-ins or libraries
as string value beneath that key. Create the \RefLibPaths key in
H_KEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Office\8.0\Access. Within the key,
add a string value that specifies the name and location of the file to
which the reference is set. The name should be the file name, including
the extension, and the location should be the path plus the file name. For
example, if you have set a reference to the Northwind sample database, you
can add the following values:
<P>
<PRE>   Name: Northwind.mdb
   Data: C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\Samples\Northwind.mdb

</PRE><h3>DDE and DDESend Functions Do Not Work Under Windows NT Version 3.51</h3>
 
<P>
The DDE and DDESend functions do not work under Windows NT version 3.51.
For example, you might use the following function as the ControlSource
property of a text box on a form: =DDESend("Excel", "Sheet1", "R1C1",
"Hello"). If Microsoft Excel isn't running when you open the form in Form
view, Microsoft Access displays a message asking if you want to start
Microsoft Excel. When you click Yes, Microsoft Excel won't open if you are
running Windows NT version 3.51. You can avoid this problem by starting
Microsoft Excel before you open the form in Form view.
<P>
These functions work properly on later versions of Windows NT.
<P>
<P><h3>Duplicate Declarations Compile Without Displaying a Warning</h3>
 
<P>
If you create duplicate declarations in two modules, and then use the
Compile And Save All Modules command on the Debug menu in the Module
window, Microsoft Access doesn't display a warning message. Having
duplicate declarations in two modules may cause unexpected behavior in
your application. There is no way to predict which declaration Microsoft
Access will use when you run your application. If you update only one of
the declarations, you may not see the changes in your application that you
expect because the other declaration may be used.
<P>
To avoid this problem, do not create duplicate declarations in two modules.
<P>
<P><h3>Using MsgBox Statements or Functions Can Interfere with ActiveX Control</h3>
 
<P><h3>Mouse Events</h3>
 
<P>
Using MsgBox statements or functions in certain events can interfere with
other mouse events generated by Microsoft Access or an ActiveX control.
For example, using Visual Basic code containing a MsgBox statement in the
BeforeClick event of a TabStrip control prevents the TabStrip control's
Click event from being triggered.

</PRE><h3>Updates to 'Building Applications with Microsoft Access 97'</h3>
 
<P>
The following changes occurred after the book went to press:
<P>
On page 81, the Internet address given for the Microsoft Access page of
the Microsoft Support Online Web site should be
<B><A href="http://support.microsoft.com/support/access/default.asp">http://support.microsoft.com/support/access/default.asp.</A></B>
<P>
On page 622, replace the last two sentences in the second paragraph under
the heading "Adding the WebBrowser Control to a Form," with:
<P>
<PRE>   "Run Msie30.exe to install Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0 for both
   Microsoft Windows 95 and Microsoft Windows NT Workstation. The Microsoft
   Internet Explorer 3.0 Setup program will detect which version of Windows
   you are using and install the appropriate files."

</PRE><h3>Updates to Northwind Sample Database</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft Access doesn't update the chart in the "Sales by Category"
report correctly when you preview or print the report from the Database
window. To fix this problem, open the report in Design view, and display
the property sheet for the SalesChart control. Click the Build button next
to the RowSource property box to display the query. Add the CategoryID
field to the query design grid, and then save and close the query.
<P>
<P><h2>File List</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Notes</h3>
 

<UL><LI>\Program Files\Microsoft Office is the default root folder for a
   Microsoft Access installation and \Windows is the default root folder
   for a Windows 95 installation, but your machine may be different.
<LI>Files marked with an asterisk (*) are included in a Typical
   installation.
