Novice: Requires knowledge of the user interface on single-user computers.
<P>
To use a mail merge with Microsoft Access data, you can export or copy your
data to a word processor, or in Microsoft Access 2.0, 7.0 and 97, you can
choose the Merge It button on the toolbar. However, you can also create a
Microsoft Access report to generate mail-merge documents. This article
shows a technique using a Microsoft Access report as the main document in
a mail merge.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following is an example of a business letter that you can create as a

   styles and sizes.

<P><LI>Save the report. Print or preview the report to see the results of
   the merge.
<P>
</OL>Summary and General Notes
 

<UL><LI>Use label controls for all paragraphs with fixed text.

<LI>Use text box controls for all paragraphs with variable content.

<LI>Margins are determined by the width of the control. The text will
   wrap within the width of the control, not the width of the report.

<LI>The Name of a text box must be different from its field name in the
   table. If they are the same, the Name prints as a "#Error?" message.
<P>
</UL><h3>Limitations</h3>
 

<UL><LI>You cannot change the formatting of individual words. You can change
   only the formatting of the control.

<LI>You are limited to 255 characters in the ControlSource property of a
   text box. For long paragraphs, create one or more invisible text
   boxes to contain the text, then concatenate them in a visible text box.
