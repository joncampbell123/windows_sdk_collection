The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
When you use the RunApp macro action to open Microsoft Money version 4.0 or
5.0, the program does not open properly. The behavior varies depending on
the version of Microsoft Money that you are using.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Money 4.0</h3>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Money splash screen appears on the screen, but you receive
the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Not enough memory is available. If you have several applications open at
   the same time, you might need to close one of them before you start
   Money.

</PRE>This behavior occurs even if Microsoft Access is the only application open
at the time that you run your macro. When you click OK in the error dialog
box, Microsoft Money quits.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Money 5.0</h3>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Money splash screen appears on the screen and you are
prompted for a password if you have one, but the Microsoft Money program
window does not open, and the program button does not appear on the
taskbar. However, if you try to open Microsoft Money, you receive the
following message:
<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft Money is already running.

</PRE>If you are using Microsoft Windows NT and you start the Windows Task
Manager, you see "msmoney" listed as a running process.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
If you are using Microsoft Money 4.0 or 5.0, you can use the Shell()
function in a Visual Basic for Applications procedure in place of the
RunApp macro action to open Microsoft Money. To do so, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>In the Database Window, click the Modules tab.

<P><LI>Click New, and then on the Insert menu, click Procedure.

<P><LI>Type "RunMoney" (without the quotation marks) in the Name box, and then
   click OK.

<P><LI>Type the following line of code in the created function:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Shell "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Money\msmoney.exe"
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: The path to msmoney.exe on your computer may be different.

<P><LI>Save the module as ProgramFunctions.

<P><LI>Create the following new macro using the RunCode command and save it as
   RunAppTest:
<P>
<P><PRE>      RunAppTest Actions
      ----------------------------
      RunCode
<PRE></PRE>         Function Name: RunMoney()

</PRE><P><LI>Run the macro.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Access 97.
We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Open the sample database Northwind.mdb.

<P><LI>Create the following new macro using the RunApp command, and save it as
   RunAppTest:
<P>
<P><PRE>      RunAppTest Actions
      -------------------------------------------------------------
      RunApp
<PRE></PRE>         Command Line: C:\Program Files\Microsoft Money\msmoney.exe

</PRE><P><LI>Run the macro.
<P>
   Note that you see the behavior described in the "Symptoms" section.
<P>
</OL>The behavior described in this article applies only to Microsoft Money
version 4.0 or 5.0. If you try to use the RunApp action to open Microsoft
Money 98, you receive the following message:
<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft Access can't invoke the
   application using the RunApp action.

   The path to the application is invalid, or a
   component of the application is missing.

   Check the path in Windows Explorer or File
   Manager.

</PRE></OL>However, if you try to use the Shell statement described in the Workaround
section, you receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Run-time error '53':
   File not found
