The information in this article applies to:

<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the Filter By Form command to filter a form that contains a
linked subform, you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   There are too many controls on the form to allow Filter By Form.

</PRE>Upon applying the filter, you receive the error message:
<P>
<PRE>   This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down.
   If the problem persists, contact the program vendor.

</PRE>When you click the Details button, you receive the following message:
<P>
<PRE>   MSACCESS caused an invalid page fault in module KERNEL32.DLL.

   -or-

   MSACCESS caused an invalid page fault in module MSACCESS.EXE.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The subform is based on either a totals query or a crosstab query and is
linked to the main form.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
There are two possible ways to work around this behavior:

<UL><LI>Set the subform's RecordSource property to a temporary table created
   with a make-table query based on the original totals query or crosstab
   query.

<LI>Use the form's other filtering capabilities to filter the data, such as
   Filter By Selection, or Advanced Filter/Sort.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Access 97.
We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
