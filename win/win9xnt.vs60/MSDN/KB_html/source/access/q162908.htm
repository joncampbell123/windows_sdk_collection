The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI> Microsoft Access 97
<LI> Microsoft Internet Information Server 2.0 and 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
The data that is displayed in table Lookup fields that you created with
the Lookup Wizard is ignored when you export the table to HTML, IDC, or
ASP format. The bound column for the Lookup field is displayed in the Web
browser, not the lookup data that you see when you open the table in
Datasheet view in Microsoft Access.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
If you exported to HTML format with the Save As/Export command on the File
menu, you did not click to select the Save Formatted check box in the "Save
Table &lt;Table Name&gt; In" dialog box.
<P>
If you exported to Internet Database Connector (IDC) or Active Server
Pages (ASP) format, the SQL statement that Microsoft Access generated
contains the actual data that is stored in the table's Lookup field. The
bound column of a Lookup field's RowSource property is what is actually
stored in the table, not necessarily what you see in Datasheet view of the
table in Microsoft Access.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
If you want to create static HTML files, click Save As/Export on the File
menu, and then click to select the Save Formatted check box in the "Save
Table &lt;Table Name&gt; In" dialog box. If you click Save As HTML on the File
menu to create static HTML files, the files you create from tables or
queries automatically include the Save Formatted option.
<P>
If you are exporting to IDC or ASP format, create an AutoLookup query that
includes the original table, as well as the table from which the Lookup
field obtains its data. Use the corresponding fields from the lookup table
in the query instead of the Lookup fields from the original table. Then
export the query to IDC or ASP format.
<P>
For example, if you open the sample database Northwind.mdb and view the
Orders table in Datasheet view, you see the complete customer name in the
Customer column. However, if you export the Orders table to IDC or ASP
format, only the CustomerID is exported; CustomerID is the bound column in
the Customer Lookup field in the Orders table. If you create an AutoLookup
query that contains both the Customers and Orders tables, you can add all
the fields from the Orders table to the QBE grid, except the CustomerID
field; add the CompanyName field from the Customers table instead. When you
export the query, it contains the same data as the Orders table, including
the full customer name.
<P>
For more information about creating AutoLookup queries, search the Help
Index for "AutoLookup queries," or ask the Microsoft Access 97 Office
Assistant.

<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 
<P>
The following steps reproduce the behavior by exporting a static HTML
file. The same behavior will occur if you export to IDC or ASP file
formats.

<OL><P><LI>Start Microsoft Access and open the sample database Northwind.mdb.

<P><LI>Open the Products table in Design view.

<P><LI>Select the SupplierID field, and then click the Lookup tab in the Field
   Properties section of the Design window. Information under this tab
   indicates that SupplierID is a Lookup field.

<P><LI>Close the Products table, and leave it selected in the Database window.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Save As/Export.

<P><LI>In the Save As dialog box, click "To an External File or Database," and
   then click OK.

<P><LI>In the "Save Table 'Products' In" dialog box, select a folder on your
   Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) where you have Read
   permission, or save the file locally and copy the HTML file to the your
   IIS Web server folder after the export is complete.

<P><LI>In the "Save Table 'Products' In" dialog box, select HTML Documents
   (*.html; *.htm) in the Save As Type box, and then type Products.html in
   the File Name box. Verify that Save Formatted is not checked, and then
   click Export.

<P><LI>Start your Web browser program, and type the Uniform Resource Locator
   (URL) in the Address box to view the Products.html file. Note that the
   URL depends upon where your files are located on the Web Server. For
   example, if you saved Products.html in the wwwroot folder of your Web
   server, type:
<P>
<P><PRE>      <B>http://&lt;servername&gt;/products.HTML</B>
</PRE><P>
   When the Products.html file opens, note that the SupplierID column
   shows the actual SupplierID code and not the Company Name.
