The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
When you create a Microsoft Access form in Microsoft Excel that is based
on data in a spreadsheet and you add additional information to that
spreadsheet, the new data is not updated in the Microsoft Access form even
though it is highlighted in the Microsoft Excel spreadsheet.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The information that is sent to Microsoft Access is defined by a named
range in the spreadsheet. The named range is not updated when you add
additional rows of information to the spreadsheet.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
You must redefine the named range in the spreadsheet. To redefine a range
of cells in Microsoft Excel, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Insert menu, point to Name, and then click Define.

<P><LI>In the Define Name box, click the named range for the Microsoft Access
   form in the Names In Workbook box. The name for the range will probably
   be similar to the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Book1_Sheet1_List
</PRE>
<P><LI>Select the range in the Refers To box and modify the range to include
   any newly added rows. You can do so by typing the new range in the box.
<P>
   NOTE: The Refers To box displays the reference, formula, or constant the
   name represents.

<P><LI>After you have modified the range, click OK.

<P><LI>Click View MS Access Form on the spreadsheet. The newly added
   information should be available in the Microsoft Access form.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start Microsoft Excel 97 and on Sheet1 of a new workbook enter the
   following in cells A1:C3:
<P>
<PRE>      A1: First   B1: Last    C1: Middle.
      A2: Adam    B2: Smith   C2: A.
      A3: Bob     B3: Jones   C3: B.

</PRE><P><LI>Save the workbook as Book1.xls.

<P><LI>Click cell A1 on Sheet1.

<P><LI>On the Data menu, click Access Form and in the "Create Microsoft Access
   Form" box, click New Database, and then click OK.

<P><LI>In the Form Wizard, add all the fields in the Available Fields box
   to Selected Fields, and then click Next.

<P><LI>On the "What layout would you like for your form" page, click Tabular,
   and then click Finish.

<P><LI>When the wizard has created the new form, note the records in the
   form. Close the form, and then close Microsoft Access.

<P><LI>Switch to Microsoft Excel and in Sheet1 of Book1.xls in cells A4:C4,
   type the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>       A4: Bill  B4: Williams  C4: C.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Click "View MS Access Form." Note the newly added record has not been
   added to the form even though the information is selected in the
   Microsoft Excel spreadsheet.
