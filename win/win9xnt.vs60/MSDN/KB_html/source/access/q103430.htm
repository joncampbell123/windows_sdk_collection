<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Novice: Requires knowledge of the user interface on single-user computers.
<P>
When you print forms and reports, you run out of temporary disk space or
your reports are printed slowly.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Forms and reports containing lines, bordered fields, or opaque fields are
printed much more slowly than the same form or report containing no graphic
objects. This behavior holds true for Windows-based applications in
general.
<P>
Because lines, bordered fields, and opaque fields are treated as bitmaps, a
great deal of data is sent to the printer at once. Large temporary files
are needed to print the form or report.
<P>
If you specify an incorrect or low setting for printer memory in Control
Panel, Windows will "band" complex print jobs. That is, it sends small
blocks of graphics to the printer, then clears them after the printer has
processed them. Because Windows cannot band text, it sends TrueType fonts
to the printer as graphics. When this occurs, the files become extremely
large.
<P>
When you print your document in landscape format, your print speed may
decrease and your temporary files may increase in size. In Microsoft Access
versions 1.0 and 1.1, this problem occurs primarily because Microsoft
Access versions 1.0 and 1.1 print lines as graphics.
<P>
Printing a line as a graphic is acceptable if the line is horizontal
because graphics are sent to the printer one row of pixels at a time.
However, vertical lines can be a problem. In large graphics, a record is
sent to the printer for each pixel in the line. When you print in landscape
format, the printer interprets these horizontal lines as vertical lines.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Access version 2.0 and 7.0 have a FastLaserPrinting property for
forms and reports. If you set the FastLaserPrinting property setting to
Yes, lines and rectangles in your form or report are replaced by rules when
you print the form or report. This property speeds up printing only on
certain laser printers; it has no effect on dot-matrix printers. The
FastLaserPrinting property also cannot speed up early versions of laser
printers that do not support rules.
