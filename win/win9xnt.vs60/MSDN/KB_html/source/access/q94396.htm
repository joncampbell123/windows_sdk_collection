<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Novice: Requires knowledge of the user interface on single-user computers.
<P>
In Microsoft Access 2.0, 7.0 and 97, if a control's Visible property is set
to No, the control will be visible in Datasheet view, but invisible in Form
view. You do not need to do anything special to see the field in Datasheet
view.
<P>
However, Microsoft Access version 1.x does not have a command to display a
control in Datasheet view that is invisible in Form view. But by changing
the color characteristics and the size, you can create a control that will
seem invisible in Form view yet be visible in Datasheet view.
<P>
In Microsoft Access version 1.x, to create a control that is visible in
Datasheet view and invisible in Form view, you need to set the following
properties of the control:
<P>
<PRE>   BorderStyle: Clear
   Width: 0
   Height: 0

</PRE>You will also have to remove the caption box if one exists with the
control.
<P>
NOTE: The drawback of this method is that, although you cannot see the
control, the control still has a tab order. Because of this, a user
can have the focus set to the control immediately before the invisible
control and press TAB. The focus will move to the control, yet the
user will not see anything, making it look as though the pointer has
disappeared. Pressing TAB again or setting focus to another control
with the mouse will cause the pointer to reappear.
