<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Novice: Requires knowledge of the user interface on single-user computers.
<P>
If you are running a regular version of Microsoft Windows 3.x (not
Windows for Workgroups or Windows NT) during the installation of
Microsoft Access version 1.0 or 1.1, Setup automatically inserts the
following MS-DOS command in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file:
<P>
<PRE>   &lt;MS-DOS directory&gt;\SHARE.EXE /L:500

</PRE>If you are running Windows for Workgroups, we recommend that you not
load this SHARE command.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Access versions 1.0 and 1.1</h3>
 
<P>
Setup automatically detects Windows for Workgroups and does not
install SHARE if Windows for Workgroups is found.
<P>
Windows for Workgroups has its own sharing mechanism (VSHARE.386),
which is loaded with Windows by a SYSTEM.INI file entry. VSHARE.386
is intended as a replacement for SHARE.EXE.
<P>
SHARE.EXE is dependent on the number of locks specified by the /L:
parameter, with a default of 20. VSHARE.386, on the other hand,
allocates the number of locks dynamically.
<P>
Because VSHARE.386 is a 386 enhanced mode virtual device driver (VxD),
it contains features that improve file sharing when running in 386
enhanced mode.  Because it was designed to work with Windows for
Workgroups, VSHARE.386 has greater usability features than SHARE.EXE,
especially regarding access control.
<P>
If SHARE.EXE is loaded and you start Windows for Workgroups in 386
enhanced mode, VSHARE.386 takes over file sharing control until you
exit Windows. If you usually run Windows for Workgroups in 386
enhanced mode, you may not need to run SHARE.EXE at all, saving you 5K
or more of conventional memory. The number of locks available is
especially important if you are using your Windows for Workgroups
computer as a network server.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Access version 2.0</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft Access version 2.0 will install VSHARE.386 instead of modifying
the AUTOEXEC.BAT file to load SHARE.EXE. If you are already loading
SHARE.EXE in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file, Microsoft Access will leave the line
in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file alone, but will still install VSHARE.386. When
you enter 386 enhanced mode, VSHARE.386 will take over from SHARE.EXE.
