The information in this article applies to:

</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
Creating labels that print on dot-matrix or tractor-feed printers usually
requires that you adjust the page size. Before you create a mailing label
report for these printers, you must first set the default printer and
paper size in Control Panel.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Setting Default Printer/Paper Size in Control Panel</h3>
 
<P>
To set the default printer and paper size, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>In the Printers dialog box in Control Panel, select a dot-matrix
   printer, then click "Set As Default" on the File menu in Windows 95.
   Click the Set As Default Printer in Windows 3.1 or Windows for
   Workgroups. (If you do not already have a dot matrix printer driver
   installed, you must first install one.)

<P><LI>Display the dialog box for that printer by clicking Properties
   on the File menu in Windows 95 or clicking the Setup button in Windows
   3.1 or Windows for Workgroups.

<P><LI>Click the Paper tab and click the Custom paper size in Windows 95.
   In Windows 3.1 or Windows for Workgroups select User-Defined Size
   in the Paper Size box.

<P><LI>In the User-Defined Size dialog box, select the unit of measurement,
   and then type the width and the length of the mailing label page.
<P>
   To determine the width, measure from the left edge of the leftmost
   label to the right edge of the rightmost label. To determine the
   length, measure from the top of the first label to the top of the
   second label.
<P>
   For example, if you use two-up labels that measure 3 inches by 5
   inches (with .25 inches between), set Unit to 0.01 inches, Width to
   625, and Length to 525.

<P><LI>Click OK to close the User-Defined Size dialog box.

<P><LI>Click OK to close the printer Property dialog box.
<P>
   Once you set the printer and paper size, you can create a mailing
   label report for a dot-matrix printer using the Label Wizard
   (Mailing Label Wizard in Access 2.0), or using tools provided in the
   Design view of the report.
<P>
</OL><h3>Creating a Mailing Label Report Not Using Report Wizard</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Open the report in Design view and remove the page header and footer.
   (You need only the Detail section for this report.)

<P><LI>On the View menu select Properties to show the Properties sheet.

<P><LI>Adjust the width setting of the report to the width of one label.

<P><LI>Adjust the height setting of the detail section to the height of one
   label.

<P><LI>Add controls to the detail section, making sure that the controls
   do not overlap. To create margins for the labels, place the text
   boxes at least 0.2 inches from all edges of the detail section.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Page Setup (Windows 95) or Print Setup
   (Windows 3.1 or Windows for Workgroups) and verify or set the
   following values in the Page Setup dialog box:
<P>
<P><PRE>    a. Click the Paper tab, set Size to User-Defined Size and Source to
       Tractor. (If these settings are not available, click Use Specific
       Printer, and then select your dot matrix printer.)
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    b. Click the Margins tab and set all margins to 0.0 inches.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    c. Click the Layout tab (Windows 95) or Item Size group (Windows 3.1
       or Windows for Workgroups), and make sure the Same as Detail check
       box is selected. (Choose the More button to display the Item
       Size group in Windows 3.1 or Windows for Workgroups.)
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    d. If there is more than one label across the page, you must also set
       the following items:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>        1. In the Grid Settings or Items Across box, enter the number of
           labels across.

        2. In the Row Spacing box, enter the amount of space between the
           bottom of one label and the top of the next.

        3. In the Column Spacing box, enter the amount of space between
           the right edge of one label and the left edge of the next.

   NOTE: When a dot-matrix printer is the default in Control Panel and
   you have Paper Size set to User-Defined Size, Microsoft Access uses
   only that paper size. If you want to create or print a label or
   report on a page of a different size, remember to change the
   user-defined page size in Control Panel before you create or print
   your label or report.
