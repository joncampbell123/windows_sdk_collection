<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
This article demonstrates how to use a single bound control both for
finding records and entering data in a form.
<P>
You can use this technique to find whether the value entered in a field
already exists in another record. If the value does exist in another
record, the record containing that value will be displayed. If the value
does not exist in another record, you can continue entering data for the
current record.
<P>
This article assumes that you are familiar with Access Basic and with
creating Microsoft Access applications using the programming tools provided
with Microsoft Access. For more information on Access Basic, please refer
to the "Building Applications" manual.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Access "User's Guide" demonstrates a method that you can use
to find records in your database by selecting a key value from a list. (See
"Finding a Record by Selecting a Value from a List.") This method is
limited in that it requires two controls. One control is an unbound control
that is used to select the value to look for, and the other control is a
bound control in which data entry for that value occurs.
<P>
The following example demonstrates how to use a single, bound control to
achieve the same functionality.
<P>
NOTE: The field to which the control is bound cannot be a required field
and it cannot have a validation rule that allows null values. Make sure
that the field's Required property is set to No and that its ValidationRule
property does not allow null values.

<P>
</OL><h3>How the Sample Functions Work</h3>
 
<P>
The Find_BeforeUpdate() function uses the FindFirst method to search the
dynaset the form is based on to see if the value entered in the control
exists in the table.
<P>
If the value does not exist, the global variable Found is set to NULL and
the function exits. If the value does exist, the global variable Found is
set to the bookmark of the found record to be used by the Find_OnExit()
function.
<P>
Before the found record can be presented, the BeforeUpdate event must be
canceled, and a SendKeys action must send two ESC keys to undo changes to
the current record.
<P>
Next, the SendKeys action sends a TAB key to exit the field. This event
triggers the Find_OnExit() function, which checks to see if the find was
successful. If it was, the CancelEvent action is run to prevent exiting the
control, and then the form record is synchronized with the found record by
setting its bookmark equal to the bookmark of the found record. Found is
then reset back to NULL.
