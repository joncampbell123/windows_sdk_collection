The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access versions 7.0, 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you create a report based on a linked table that is of the text file
type in Microsoft Access for Windows 95, you may receive the following
error message when you reopen the report after quitting and restarting
Microsoft Access:
<P>
<PRE>   The text file specification '&lt;tablename&gt; Link Specification' does not
   exist. You can't import, export, or attach using the specification.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The linked text table must be opened before you can preview the report.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Open the linked text table that the report is based on, and then preview
the report.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Access
version 7.0.
<P>
This behavior has been found to occur in Microsoft Access 97 in the
following situations:

<UL><LI>A parameterized query (query parameter or form) based on a linked text
   table that has not been saved and reopened (or has been changed in any
   slight way after running successfully).

<LI>A report based on a query being opened without the table that the query
   is based on being opened beforehand.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
