<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multiuser skills.
<P>
By default, a chart sorts the X-axis fields in alphabetical or numeric
order. This article describes two methods you can use to sort the X-axis
fields in a different order.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
There are two methods you can use to change the ordering of fields in a
chart. The first way is to add an Order By clause to the SQL statement in
the chart's RowSource property. The second way is to create a query that
orders the fields the way you want them, and then to use the query for the
chart's RowSource property.
<P>
<P><h3>How to Create a Sample Chart</h3>
 
<P>
To create a chart, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Open the sample database Northwind.mdb.

<P><LI>Create a new, blank form not based on any table or query.

<P><LI>On the Insert menu, click Chart, and then click in the Detail section of
   the form where you want the chart to appear.

<P><LI>In the Chart Wizard dialog box, select the Sales By Category query as
   the data source for the chart, and then click Next.

<P><LI>Add the CategoryName and ProductSales fields to the Fields For Chart
   box, and then click Finish.

<P><LI>View the form in Form view. Note that the CategoryName records are
   listed in alphabetical order.
<P>
</OL><h3>How to Change the Chart's Sorting Order</h3>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1</h3>
 
<P>
The following example demonstrates how to add an Order By clause to the SQL
statement in a Chart's RowSource property:

<OL><P><LI>Open the form that you created in the "How to Create a Sample Chart"
   section in Design view.

<P><LI>Select the chart.

<P><LI>On the View menu, click Properties.

<P><LI>Select the RowSource property of the chart, and then press SHIFT+F2 to
   zoom in on the window. Note that the RowSource property's Select
   statement reads as follows:
<P>
<P><PRE>      SELECT [CategoryName],Sum([ProductSales]) AS [SumOfProductSales] FROM
      [Sales by Category] GROUP BY [CategoryName];
</PRE>
<P><LI>Type "Order By SUM([ProductSales]) desc" (without the quotation marks)
   before the semicolon at the end of the SQL statement so that the SQL
   statement reads as follows:
<P>
<P><PRE>      SELECT [CategoryName],Sum([ProductSales]) AS SumOfProductSales] FROM
      [Sales by Category] GROUP BY [CategoryName] Order By
      SUM([ProductSales]) desc;
</PRE>
<P><LI>Click OK.

<P><LI>View the form in Form view. Note that the CategoryName records are now
   listed in descending order of sales.
<P>
</OL><h3>Method 2</h3>
 
<P>
The following example describes how to create and use a query for the
chart's RowSource property:

<OL><P><LI>Re-create the form with a chart that you created in the "How to Create a
   Sample Chart" section.

<P><LI>Select the Chart.

<P><LI>On the View menu, click Properties.

<P><LI>Using the right mouse button, click the RowSource property, and then
   click Build.

<P><LI>In the SQL Statement: Query Builder window, set the sort order for the
   ProductSales field to Descending.

<P><LI>Close the SQL Statement: Query Builder window and save the changes.

<P><LI>View the form in Form view. Note that the CategoryName records are
   listed in descending order of sales.
