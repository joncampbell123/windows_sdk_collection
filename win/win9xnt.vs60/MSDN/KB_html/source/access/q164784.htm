The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multiuser skills.
<P>
When you try to synchronize with a replica that has been deleted, you may
receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft Access can't open the database '&lt;Database Name&gt;'.

   '&lt;Database Name&gt;' isn't a valid path. Make sure that the path name is
   spelled correctly and that you are connected to the server on which the
   file resides.

</PRE>This is followed by another message:
<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft Access has deleted '&lt;Database Name&gt;' and removed it from the
   replica set.

   This change isn't reflected until the database is closed and reopened.

   Do you want Microsoft Access to close and reopen the database now?

</PRE>However, after you close and reopen the database, the deleted replica name
still appears in the Synchronize With list in the Synchronize Database
dialog box.
<P>
NOTE: Microsoft Access 97 does not automatically close and reopen the
database as stated in the message. For more information about this issue,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>

   TITLE     : ACC97: DB Doesn't Close and Reopen After Failed
               Synchronization

</PRE><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
In order to remove the deleted replica database from the synchronization
list, Microsoft Access 97 must be able to locate the folder where the
replica once resided. If the folder that contained the replica has been
deleted or renamed, recreate the folder or rename it to its original name.
Then synchronize with the deleted replica, and Microsoft Access will
remove the replica from the synchronization list.

<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create a new blank database named dbTest.mdb.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, point to Replication, and then click Create
    Replica.

<P><LI>Click Yes in the message box that states the database must be closed
    before you can create a replica.

<P><LI>Click No in the message box that prompts you to make a backup copy of
    your database.

    Folder icon and create a new folder named dbTest Folder. Select that
    folder in the Save In box, and then click OK.
