The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access versions 2.0, 7.0, 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
The owner of a query cannot transfer its ownership if the query's
RunPermissions property is set to Owner's. This is true even if the
owner has Administer permission for the query.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Change the query's RunPermissions property from Owner's to User's. Then you
can change the ownership of the query.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design. Allowing someone to change the ownership of
the query after the RunPermissions property has been set to Owner's would
be a security breach.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To change the ownership of a database object, you must have Administer
permission for the object. You can change your permissions on the object if
you are logged on as the object's owner, as a member of a group that has
Administer permission on the object, or as a member of the Admins group in
the workgroup in which the database that contains the object was created.
If you cannot change your permissions on an object, see your workgroup
administrator or the object's owner.
<P>
NOTE: Even if you satisfy all conditions in the previous paragraph, you
still cannot transfer ownership of a query if its RunPermissions property
is set to Owner's.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior in Microsoft Access 7.0 and 97</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start Microsoft Access and log on as the Admin user.

<P><LI>Open the sample database Northwind.mdb, and then open the Current
   Product List query in Design view.

<P><LI>Using the right mouse button, click the query and then click Properties
   on the menu that appears. Set the query's RunPermissions property to
   Owner's, and then save and close the query.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, point to Security, and click User and Group Accounts.
   Click the New button and create a new user called Joe, and make him a
   member of the Users group. Click OK.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, point to Security, and click User and Group
   Permissions. Click the Change Owner tab.

<P><LI>In the Object Type box click Query, and select the Current Product List
   query in the Object box. In the New Owner box, select Joe. Click the
   Change Owner button. Note that you receive the message:
<P>
<P><PRE>      You don't have permission to change the owner of 'Current Product
      List.'
</PRE><P>
</OL><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior in Microsoft Access 2.0</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start Microsoft Access and log on as the Admin user.

<P><LI>Open the sample database NWIND.MDB, and then open the Catalog query
   in Design view.

<P><LI>Using the right mouse button, click the query and then click Properties
   on the menu that appears. Set the query's RunPermissions property to
   Owner's, and then save and close the query.

<P><LI>On the Security menu, click Users. Click the New button and create a new
   user called Joe, and make him a member of the Users group. Click Close.

<P><LI>On the Security menu, click Change Owner.

<P><LI>In the Object box, select the Catalog query. In the New Owner box,
   select Joe. Click the Change Owner button. Note that you receive the
   message:
<P>
<P><PRE>      You don't have permission to change the owner of 'Catalog'.
