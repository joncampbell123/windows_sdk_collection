<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Novice: Requires knowledge of the user interface on single-user computers.
<P>
This article discusses the reasons why Microsoft Access does not use
record numbers, as do some other database products.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Many database products, such as Microsoft FoxPro, dBASE IV, and Paradox,
use a record number that is physically associated with the record. For
example, the first record in a table has record number 1, the second record
has record number 2, and so on. The record numbers remain part of the
record as long as the record exists. The first record entered into a table
is always record number 1, even if the table is sorted and the record
appears somewhere other than the first position in the table.
<P>
Microsoft Access does not use this approach. When you open a table in
Datasheet view, a number appears at the bottom of the form. This number
indicates the position of the record in the recordset, not the record's
natural position in the table. For example, if a record with the key value
"Anderson" is the first record in a recordset, the number 1 appears at the
bottom of the form. However, if you sort the same records on a different
key, the record may no longer appear as the first record and a different
number may appear at the bottom of the form.
<P>
When you open a table, form, or report, Microsoft Access creates a dynaset,
a dynamic copy of the appropriate recordset, and assigns numbers to the
records therein. These numbers are used only by the user interface to
provide a visually unique identifier for each record.
<P>
Microsoft Access uses this approach because assigning a physical record
number to each record is not "relationally correct." According to
relational database theory, data may appear in any order at any time.
Therefore, the key value, not a random record number, provides the only
reliable method to identify a record.
<P>
Because no record number is available, Microsoft Access provides another
method to identify records in a recordset. Using the Bookmark property, you
can write a procedure to find a target record, store its bookmark value in
a variable, move to other records, and return to the original record. For
more information about bookmarks, search on "Bookmark" using the Help menu.
<P>
dBASE IV and Paradox are manufactured by Borland International, Inc., a
vendor independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise,
regarding this product's performance or reliability.
