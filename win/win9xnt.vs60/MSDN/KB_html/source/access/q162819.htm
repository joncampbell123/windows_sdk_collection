The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access 97
</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multi-user skills.
<P>
IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, you should first make a backup copy of the
registry files (System.dat and User.dat). Both are hidden files in the
Windows folder.
<P>
The most recently used (MRU) file list is the list of the last four
database files that were opened in Microsoft Access. It appears in the
Startup screen for Microsoft Access and at the bottom of the File menu. You
can remove the names of the last four opened database files by editing the
registry.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall Windows 95. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved.
Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the Changing Keys And
Values online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Note that you
should make a backup copy of the registry files (System.dat and User.dat)
before you edit the registry.
<P>
In earlier versions of Microsoft Access, the MRU list was stored by user in
the workgroup information file (by default, System.mda in versions 1.x and
2.0 or System.mdw in version 7.0). In Microsoft Access 97, this list is
stored in the registry.
<P>
To remove the file names from the MRU list, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>In the Registry Editor (regedit.exe), go to the following registry key:
<P>
<P><PRE>      HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\8.0\Access\Settings
</PRE>
<P><LI>Double-click the appropriate Value name (MRU1, MRU2, MRU3, or MRU4).

<P><LI>Delete the string that appears in the Value data box.

<P><LI>Click OK.

<P><LI>Repeat steps 2-4 for all the MRU file names that you want to remove.

<P><LI>Close the Registry Editor and open Microsoft Access.
<P>
</OL>The Startup screen and File menu no longer display the MRU file name(s)
that you edited in the registry. This does not permanently remove the MRU
list, however. The next time you open a database, the database file name
will be added to the list.
