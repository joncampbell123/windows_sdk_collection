This article presents the guidelines that Microsoft Technical Support
(MTS) engineers follow when supporting Microsoft Access customers.

<P>
Technical support for Microsoft Access is incident-based support. An
incident of technical support for Microsoft Access is defined as a support
question broken down in simplest terms, and the reasonable efforts to
resolve it. For example, a question about how to implement a combo box on
a form constitutes an incident.
<P>
The standard support package that you receive with Microsoft Access,
Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition Tools, and Microsoft Access
Developer's Toolkit is called Primary support. It entitles you to two free
incidents of technical support via the telephone, or electronically via
Microsoft's Web Response program on the Internet at:

</PRE>Additional support for Microsoft Access and Microsoft Office 97 Developer
Edition Tools is available with Priority Office Developer support, which
is pay-per-incident support available to you 24 hours a day, 7 days a
week. The cost of Priority Office Developer support is $55 per incident,
