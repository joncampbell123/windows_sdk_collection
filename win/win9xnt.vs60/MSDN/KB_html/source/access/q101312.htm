The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access versions 1.0, 1.1, 2.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multiuser skills.
<P>
When you try to open a second instance of an open form with an OpenForm
macro action, the instance of the form that is already open is activated.
<P>
NOTE: In Microsoft Access for Windows 95 version 7.0 there is a new feature
that allows multiple instances of the same form. For more information about
this feature, search on the phrase "Displaying Multiple Instances of a
Form" using Answer Wizard in Microsoft Access for Windows 95 Help.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
You can have only one copy of a form open at a time.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
NOTE: This article assumes that you are familiar with Access Basic and with
creating Microsoft Access applications using the programming tools provided
with Microsoft Access. For more information on Access Basic, please refer
to the "Introduction to Programming" manual in Microsoft Access version
1.x, or the "Building Applications" manual in version 2.0.
<P>
The following information describes how to create and use an Access Basic
function called OpenFormInstance(), which allows you to open more than one
copy of the same form in Microsoft Access. To make OpenFormInstance work,
you must first make &lt;x&gt; number of copies of your original form, giving each
copy a numeric suffix greater than zero. That is, if your form is called
"Customers," make copies of the form renaming them to "Customers1,"
"Customers2," "Customers3," and so forth.
<P>
When OpenFormInstance() is invoked with "Customers," it checks to see if a
copy of the form is available for display. It returns the following error
message if all instances are currently open:
<P>
<PRE>   Could not open form "Customers"
   Please close another instance and try again.

</PRE>To use the OpenFormInstance() function, create a new module with the
following Access Basic functions:
<P>
NOTE: In the following sample code, an underscore (_) is used as a
line-continuation character. Remove the underscore from the end of
the line when re-creating this code in Access Basic.

   ' PURPOSE:
   '   Allows you to open more than one copy of the same form
   '   on screen at a time.
   '
   ' PREREQUISITES:
   '   You must make X number of copies of the the

   '   Example:
   '
   '        "Customers1," "Customers2," "Customers3," ...
   '
   ' REQUIRES:
   '   Function IsLoaded() - Determines if form is loaded.
   '   Function GetFormNames() - Supplied in this module.
   '
   ' ARGUMENTS:
   '   FormName - The generic name of the form to open.
   '   Example:
   '
   '        "Customers"

   '   True  - if an instance of FormName was opened.
   '   False - if no instance of FormName was found or all available

   '   You can customize the OpenForm action in the code below to add

</PRE><h3>How to Use the OpenFormInstance() Function</h3>
 
<P>
The following steps assume there is a need to see more than one
customer form on the screen at a given time in the sample database
NWIND.MDB:

<OL><P><LI>Open NWIND.MDB and choose the Form button in the Database window.

<P><LI>Click once on the Customers form, and choose Copy from the Edit
   menu.

<P><LI>Choose Paste from the Edit menu. Type "Customers1" (without the
   quotation marks) in the Form Name box and then press ENTER.

<P><LI>Repeat step 3 for however many instances you expect your users to
   need ("Customers2," "Customers3," and so on).

<P><LI>Open the module containing the OpenFormInstance() function in Design
   view, and then choose Immediate Window from the View menu.

<P><LI>Type the following and press ENTER:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ? OpenFormInstance("Customers")
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: The first instance of the Customers form opens.

<P><LI>Repeat step 6.
<P>
   NOTE: The second instance of the Customers form opens.

<P><LI>Repeat step 6 until you receive an error message indicating that no
   more instances are available.
<P>
</OL><h3>Problems to Consider When Using OpenFormInstance()</h3>
 
<P>
Since you are not actually opening the same form multiple times (you
are opening copies), it is important that any macros and module code
that make direct references to the form using "Forms!FormName"
references be reconsidered.
<P>
If you have more than one instance of the form opened, it is best to
use the following techniques when you reference controls on the form.

<UL><LI>User Screen.ActiveForm form notation wherever possible.
<P>
<P><PRE>      MsgBox Screen.ActiveForm![ControlName]
</PRE>
<LI>When Screen.Active form is not appropriate, pass the name of the
   form to the Access Basic function to call.
<P>
<P><PRE>      Function MyFunction(MyForm)
<PRE></PRE>         MsgBox Forms(MyForm)![ControlName]
      End Function

</PRE><LI>Because you cannot pass arguments to macros, consider reworking the
   macro as an Access Basic function. You could call the function above,
   MyFunction(), using a RunCode macro action as follows:
<P>
<P><PRE>      RunCode
<PRE></PRE>         Function Name: =MyFunction(Screen.ActiveForm.FormName)

</PRE></OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
