The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access versions 1.0, 1.1, 2.0, 7.0, 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Novice: Requires knowledge of the user interface on single-user computers.
<P>
You cannot save a blank, new record in a table or form.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Access requires some form of data entry in the new record in
order to create it.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To add a blank record to a table, press SPACE BAR in any field in the
table.
<P>
To add a blank record to a form, press SPACE BAR in any field whose
ControlSource property points to a field in the underlying record source. A
SetValue or SendKeys macro action directed at the bound control will also
add a blank record to a form.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you are adding new records, Microsoft Access does not recognize that a
new record is being created until a field in the record has been "dirtied,"
or has received some input from an external source. That external source
can be a keyboard entry (other than the TAB or ENTER keys), or it can be
the result of a SendKeys or SetValue macro action. Note that default values
for fields do not qualify as external input, and have no effect on
triggering a new record in a table or form.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Access 2.0, 7.0 and 97:

<OL><P><LI>Open the sample database Northwind.mdb (or NWIND.MDB in version 2.0).

<P><LI>Open the Products table in Design view.

<P><LI>Change the ProductName field's AllowZeroLength property from No
   to Yes.
<P>
   NOTE: In version 2.0, there is a space in the Product Name field.

<P><LI>Save the table and then switch it to Datasheet view.

<P><LI>On the Records menu, click Data Entry. Note that the insertion point is
   positioned at the first field in a blank record.

<P><LI>Press TAB to move through all the fields. Note that the record indicator
   does not increment, indicating that you are still on the same record and
   that the record has not been saved.

<P><LI>Press TAB to move to the ProductName field, and then press the SPACEBAR.

<P><LI>Press TAB to move through the remaining fields until you return to the
   ProductName field. Note that the record indicator is increased by one.
<P>
</OL>In Microsoft Access version 1.x:

<OL><P><LI>Open the sample database NWIND.MDB.

<P><LI>Open the Products table in Datasheet view.

<P><LI>On the Records menu, click Data Entry. Note that the insertion point
   is positioned at the first field in a blank record.

<P><LI>Press TAB to move through all the fields twice. Note that the record
   indicator does not increment, indicating that you are still on the same
   record and that the record has not been saved.

<P><LI>Press TAB to move to the Product Name field, and then press the
   SPACEBAR.

<P><LI>Press TAB to move through the remaining fields until you return to the
   Product Name field. Note that the record indicator is increased by
   one.
