The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access version 2.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes two methods that you can use on a field formatted
for the Short Date data type so that it displays a year later than 1999.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Unless you explicitly enter the year in a date field as 2000 or later,
Microsoft Access saves the year portion as 1900 - 1999 as appropriate.
For example, if a field has the Date/Time data type, and you type the
date as 01/01/00, Microsoft Access saves the year portion internally
as 1900. If you enter the date as 01/01/2000, Microsoft Access saves the
year portion internally as 2000. However, the date still appears in the
date field as 01/01/00 if displayed using the Short Date format
<P>
There are two methods you can use to display fields formatted for the Short
Date data type with years later than 1999; however, both methods have
limitations in that they add 100 years to the input date only if the last
two digits in the date are 00 through 49, inclusive. Therefore, these
methods work accurately only for dates between the years 1950 and 2049,
inclusive.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1</h3>
 
<P>
Method 1 adds a procedure to the field's AfterUpdate event that checks the
year, and if the year is less than 1950 (that is, the last two digits are
00 through 49), it adds 100 years to the date. To use this method, follow
these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Create a new, blank form as follows and save the form as Test1:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Form: Test1
      -------------------------------
      Text Box:
<PRE></PRE>         Name: MyLongDate
         ControlSource: =[MyShortDate]
         Format: Long Date
      Text Box:
         Name: MyShortDate
         Format: Short Date
         AfterUpdate: Event Procedure

</PRE><P><LI>Click the Build button to the right of the AfterUpdate property to
   open the Module window. Note that the following two lines appear in
   the Module window:
<P>
<PRE>      Sub MyShortDate_AfterUpdate ()

      End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>In the blank space between the two lines above, type the following code:
<P>
<PRE>        If Year(Me!MyShortDate) &lt; 1950 Then
           Me!MyShortDate = DateAdd("yyyy", 100, Me!MyShortDate)
        End If

</PRE><P><LI>Open the form in Form view, and enter the following sample data in
   the MyShorDate text box:
<P>
<P><PRE>      12/25/01
      10/20/50
      9/8/95
      7/16/05
      8/15/49
      1/1/00
</PRE><P>
   Note that when you enter a date in the MyShortDate text box, the
   AfterUpdate event procedure adds 100 years to the date you enter if
   the year is between 1900 and 1949. The corrected date is displayed
   in long date format in the MyLongDate text box as follows:
<P>
<PRE>      Date You Entered in    Date Displayed in
      MyShortDate Text Box   MyLongDate text box
      -------------------------------------------------
      12/25/01               Tuesday, December 25, 2001
      10/20/50               Friday, October 20, 1950
      9/8/95                 Friday, September 08, 1995
      7/16/05                Saturday, July 16, 2005
      8/15/49                Sunday, August 15, 2049
      1/1/00                 Saturday, January 1, 2000

</PRE></OL><h3>Method 2</h3>
 
<P>
Method 2 uses the expression below in the Update To line in an update
query. You can use this method if you have a table that already contains
dates that you want to convert to the year 2000 and later. The expression
assumes the name of the field you want to update is myDateField.
Substitute the name of the field in your table for the myDateField field
in the expression below.
<P>
NOTE: In the following expression, an underscore (_) at the end of a line
is used as a line-continuation character. Remove the underscore from the
end of the line when re-creating this expression.
<P>
<PRE>   iif(Year([myDateField]) &lt; 1950, DateAdd("yyyy", 100, [myDateField]), _
      [myDateField])
