The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access versions 1.0, 1.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
You receive the error message "Can't save; record is locked by another
user" in Microsoft Access, even when only one user (in one session on one
computer) is using a database opened for shared access.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This error can be caused by an insufficient number of share locks.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Be sure that the number of share locks is set to 500 or more. The
number of share locks is set by the /L:xxxx parameter when SHARE.EXE
is invoked, usually in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file, as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   C:\DOS\SHARE.EXE /L:500

</PRE>The Microsoft Access Setup program modifies your AUTOEXEC.BAT file
and sets the number of share locks to 500, but some other program
may alter that value.
<P>
Although 500 share locks are sufficient for most Microsoft Access
applications, some applications may have problems related to the
number of share locks. You may need to gradually increase the number
of share locks until these problems disappear. Try to add as few share
locks as possible, since each share lock uses memory.
<P>
Note that if you are running Microsoft Access under Windows for
Workgroups in 386 Enhanced mode, then you do not need to load SHARE.EXE
in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file. VSHARE.386, which is loaded automatically by
Windows for Workgroups in 386 Enhanced mode, will take care of this
problem.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior no longer occurs in Microsoft Access version 2.0.
