The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access version 2.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Novice: Requires knowledge of the user interface on single-user computers.
<P>
When you attempt to save modifying code stored in a form or report code
module, or when you attempt to save a form or report that has had its code
modified, you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Cannot destroy active form instance.

</PRE>When you press the Help button on the error message, Microsoft Access
displays the main table of contents for the Microsoft Access Help file.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
You cannot modify certain code stored in the form or the report code module
This usually occurs when the code is running from the form or report code
module and a request is made to close the form before the code is finished.
If the form were closed, the code would not be able to run through to
completion.
<P>
No online Help topic is available to explain this error message.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Be sure that the form is not running in Form view when you modify the code.
Close the form, or open the form in Design view, when you modify the code.
Save the code module, and then open the form in Form view.
<P>
The error described above usually occurs after you receive a run-time
error and then try to fix the error without resetting the function.
<P>
If you have already modified the form or report module code, you may
receive the error message when you close the form and are asked if you
want to save your changes. If you click Yes, the error message appears.
You must click No and abandon any changes you have made in order to exit
the form.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior no longer occurs in Microsoft Access version 7.0.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This error frequently occurs when you are debugging library code. If a form
in your library is activated and displayed on the screen and an error
occurs in your code, the code stops running and an error message is
displayed. If you attempt to modify this code and then close the form, you
receive the error message. You must close the form prior to making any
changes in the code.
<P>
This is a trapable error. The error code is 95.
