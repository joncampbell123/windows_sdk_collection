<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Novice: Requires knowledge of the user interface on single-user computers.
<P>
If you supply a company name in the Company Information form of the Small
Business Pack, that name may not appear in certain places within the Small
Business Pack. For example, the name may not appear on any of the menu form
headers. Also, when you preview or print the Time Billing report from the
Small Business Pack, the Company Name field is not visible.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Visible property of the Company Name field is set to No in different
locations, such as the Company Logo form or the Company Header report of
the Small Business Pack. The Company Name field may also be hidden behind
the Company Logo field.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>

follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Open any one of the Small Business Pack databases.

<P><LI>On the View menu, click Form Design.

<P><LI>Double-click the Company Logo subform to open it in Design view.

<P><LI>Using the right mouse button (right-click), click the Company Name
    field, and then click Properties.

<P><LI>Click the Format tab. Change the Visible property from No to Yes, and

    "Company Name," and change the BackStyle property to Transparent.

<P><LI>Close and save the Company Logo subform.

<P><LI>Quit Microsoft Access.

    Company Name field now appears in the menu form headers, along with the
    Company logo.
<P>

visible, follow these steps:
