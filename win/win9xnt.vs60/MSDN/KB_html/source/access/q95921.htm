<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article presents a brief overview of the ORACLE relational
database management system (RDBMS) and the ORACLE Open Database
Connectivity (ODBC) driver.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
ORACLE RDBMS is a multiuser relational database management system that
runs with various workstation and minicomputer operating systems. The
IBM-PC and compatible computers running Microsoft Windows can
communicate with ORACLE database servers over a network. Supported
networks include Microsoft LAN Manager, NetWare, VINES, DECnet, and
any network that supports TCP/IP.
<P>
The ORACLE driver enables an application to access data in an ORACLE
database through the ODBC interface. The driver communicates with the
network through SQL*Net. The following diagram details the application
and driver architecture:
<P>
<PRE>                          Application
                               :
                               :

                           (ODBC.DLL)
                               :
                               :
                         ORACLE Driver
                          (SQORA.DLL)

                               :
                               :
                          ORACLE RDBMS

</PRE>The ORACLE driver complies with API Conformance Level 1 and SQL
Conformance Level Core. The ORACLE driver also supports some functions
in API Conformance Level 2 and most of the grammar in the Core and
Extended SQL conformance levels.
<P>
To access ORACLE data, the following components are required:

<UL><LI>The ORACLE driver

<LI>An ORACLE RDBMS database

<LI>A network that connects the computers that run the driver and the
   database. The network must support SQL*Net connections.
<P>
</UL>The following section describes the hardware and software that each
component requires.
<P>
<P><h3>ORACLE Driver</h3>
 
<P>
The ORACLE driver requires an Industry Standard Architecture (ISA)
computer, such as the IBM PC/AT or compatible, a Micro Channel
Architecture (MCA) computer, such as an IBM PS/2 or compatible, or an
Extended Standard Architecture (EISA) computer.
<P>
The computer must have an 80286, 80386, or 80486 microprocessor, at
least eight megabytes of random-access memory (RAM), and a hard disk
with approximately 10 megabytes (MB) of free space.
<P>
The ORACLE driver requires MS-DOS version 3.3 or later, Microsoft
Windows version 3.0a or 3.1, and ODBC Driver Manager version 1.0.
<P>
<P><h3>ORACLE RDBMS</h3>
 
<P>
To access data in an ORACLE database with the ORACLE driver, ORACLE
RDBMS version 6.0 or later is required. For more information on the
hardware and software required to run ORACLE RDBMS, please refer to
the ORACLE RDBMS user documentation.
<P>
<P><h3>Network Software</h3>
 
<P>
A network is required to connect the computers on which the ORACLE
RDBMS and the ORACLE driver run. For more information about the
hardware and software that each network requires, please refer to the
user documentation for your particular networking product.
<P>
The ORACLE driver and the ORACLE RDBMS use SQL*Net as a common network
interface; it should be possible to use the ORACLE driver on any
SQL*Net connection from Windows to an ORACLE database server. For more
information about SQL*Net, please refer to the SQL*Net user
documentation.
<P>
NOTE: SQL*Net components are available only from Oracle Corporation.
<P>
<P><h3>Database Error</h3>
 
<P>
When a database error occurs, the ORACLE driver returns the native
error number, the SQLSTATE (an ODBC error code), and an error message.
The driver determines these values from the errors it detects and from
the errors that the ORACLE RDBMS returns.
<P>
<P><h3>Native Error</h3>
 
<P>
When an error occurs in the data source, the ORACLE driver returns the
native error that the ORACLE RDBMS returns to it. When the driver or
the Driver Manager detects the error, the ORACLE driver returns 0
(zero) for the native error number.
<P>
<P><h3>SQLSTATE</h3>
 
<P>
When an error occurs in the data source, the ORACLE driver maps the
native error code it receives from the ORACLE RDBMS to the appropriate
SQLSTATE. When the driver or the Driver Manager detects the error, the
ORACLE driver or the Driver Manager generates the appropriate
SQLSTATE.
<P>
<P><h3>Error Message</h3>
 
<P>
When an error occurs in the data source, the ORACLE driver returns an
error message based on the message returned from the ORACLE RDBMS.
When an error occurs in the ORACLE driver or in the Driver Manager,
the ORACLE driver returns the error message associated with the
SQLSTATE. The error message is displayed in the following format:
<P>
<PRE>   &lt;vendor&gt;&lt;ODBC-component&gt;&lt;data-source&gt;error-message

</PRE>The prefix items in angle brackets (&lt;&gt;) identify the location of the
error. The table below shows the value returned by the ORACLE driver
for each of these prefix items. Note that when an error occurs in the
data source, the &lt;vendor&gt; and &lt;ODBC-component&gt; variables identify the
vendor and name of the ODBC component that received the error.
<P>
