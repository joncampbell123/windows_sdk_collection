<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Commonly asked questions about Microsoft Access version 1.0 are listed
below.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
1.Q. Is it possible to customize the Help file in Microsoft Access?
<P>
<PRE>  A. Customized Help files can be used only in Microsoft Access forms.
     Use the HelpContextId and HelpFile properties of the form to
     reference a Help file previously constructed with the Microsoft
     Windows Help Compiler. For more information on this, search for
     "HelpContextId" in the Microsoft Access online Help.

</PRE>2.Q. Is it possible to set up a many-to-many relationship?
<P>
<PRE>  A. No. The only kinds of relationships you can define are
     one-to-many and one-to-one. It is generally not a good database
     design to have many-to-many relationships. An alternative is to
     build a linking table between two tables that have a many-to-many
     relationship. For example, if you had an "Employees" table and a
     "Job Skills" table, each employee may have many skills, and each
     skill could belong to more than one employee--a many-to-many
     relationship. To work around this, you would build a linking
     table "EmpSkill" that had two columns, EmpID and SkillID, to
     relate the two tables.

</PRE>3.Q. Where are OLE objects (such as the pictures in the Employees table
<PRE>     in NWIND.MDB) stored?

  A. OLE objects can be either linked or embedded. Embedded objects
     are stored inside the .MDB file. Linked objects point to a file
     located external to the database, and are therefore not stored in
     the .MDB file. Since the Employees' pictures within NWIND.MDB are
     embedded OLE objects, the pictures are stored in NWIND.MDB.

</PRE>4.Q. How can I tell if an OLE object is embedded or linked?
<P>
<PRE>  A. To tell if an object is linked or embedded, first select the
     object, then choose the last command on the Edit menu. The
     command name varies depending on the object type. (For example,
     "Paintbrush Picture Object," "Microsoft Excel Worksheet Object,"
     and so on.) When the option is highlighted or selected, a submenu
     appears to the right of the menu. If the object in question is an
     embedded object, the Change Link option will be unavailable
     (dimmed). If it is a linked object, the Change Link option will
     not be dimmed.

</PRE>5.Q. Is all the information (tables, queries, reports, and so on) that
<PRE>     appears as part of a database actually stored in the database?

  A. All database information is stored in the database, with the
     exception of database "preferences" (choose Options from the View
     menu) and certain security information (users, their passwords,
     and group information), which are stored in the SYSTEM.MDA file.

</PRE>6.Q. Is it possible to break out the information that is contained in a
<PRE>     database (that is, tables) into individual files?

  A. You can use the Export option to export tables and other data to
     separate files (ASCII, dBASE, and so on). You can also export
     Microsoft Access objects to other Microsoft Access databases.

</PRE>7.Q. Is some type of tool available that helps document applications?
<PRE>     (For example, variables used, macros used, properties of different
     interface elements, and so on.)

  A. A tool called "Database Analyzer" is included with Microsoft
     Access that aids in this task. For information on using this
     tool, look in the PSSKB.TXT file, question number 23, or
     choose the Microsoft Access Q&amp;A icon in the Access group in the
     Microsoft Windows Program Manager.

</PRE>8.Q. Are memo fields part of a table, or are they stored in a
<PRE>     separately linked file as is done in FoxPro, which has .DBF and
     .FPT files?

  A. They are part of a table and thus stored in the .MDB file.

</PRE>9.Q. Can Microsoft Access create stand-alone applications?
<P>
<PRE>  A. Currently, Microsoft Access does not create stand-alone
     applications. Since there is not yet a run-time version of
     Microsoft Access, a developer and his or her customers both
     require full working copies of Microsoft Access to run Microsoft
     Access applications. The developer distributes only the .MDB
     file(s) for the application to the customers.

     A run-time version of Microsoft Access is planned for the near
     future that a developer can distribute with his or her .MDB
     file(s) so that customers will not require a full working copy of
     Microsoft Access to run applications.
