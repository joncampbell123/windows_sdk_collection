The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access versions 7.0, 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multiuser skills.
<P>
When you open a database replica in Microsoft Access 7.0 or 97, you may
receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Can't Update. Database or object is read-only.

</PRE>This may be followed by the following error message, depending on your
version of Microsoft Access.
<P>
<P><h3>In Microsoft Access 97</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft Access couldn't create storage space for a Visual Basic
   module.

   -or-

   Automation error.

   Catastrophic failure.

</PRE><h3>In Microsoft Access 7.0</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   OLE Automation Error

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
You are trying to open the replica read-only immediately after it was
created or synchronized with another replica.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
When you open a replica for the first time after its creation or
synchronization with another replica, open it for read/write access. This
will ensure that Microsoft Access is able to compile and store the Visual
Basic for Applications project in the replica. The next time you open the
replica, you will be able to open it for read-only access.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Access 7.0 and
97. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The first time you open a replica after its creation, or after
synchronization with another replica whose Visual Basic for Applications
project has changed, Microsoft Access will attempt to compile and store the
replica's Visual Basic for Applications project. The compiled Visual Basic
for Applications project is stored in an internal system table.
<P>
When you open a replica for the first time after its creation or
synchronization with another replica, Microsoft Access cannot store the
compiled Visual Basic for Applications project in the replica if you are
opening it read-only. This results in the error(s) listed in the "Symptoms"
section.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create a new, blank database.

<P><LI>On the Tools Menu, point to Replication, and then click Create Replica.

<P><LI>Click Yes when prompted to close the current database.

<P><LI>Click No when prompted to create a backup of the database.

<P><LI>Select a location for the new replica, and then click OK. You will
   receive a confirmation message indicating the database has been
   converted to a Design Master, and that a replica has been created.
   Click OK to close the message.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Open Database.

<P><LI>Locate the replica you created in step 5, right-click it to view its
   shortcut menu, and then click Open Read-Only. Note that you receive the
   error message:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Can't Update. Database or object is read-only.
