This article lists tips that you can use to optimize the performance of
Microsoft Access for Windows 95 version 7.0. Much of this information is
taken from the Microsoft Access for Windows 95 Help file. For a more
detailed discussion of this topic, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Ttile:      ACC95: Achieving Optimal Performance Paper Available on MSL

</PRE>Note that the optimal setting for each item may vary with the type of
computer on which you run Microsoft Access. It is usually best to change
only one setting at a time and then to monitor database performance for
improvement.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To optimize the general performance of Microsoft Access 7.0, use
these tips:

<UL><LI>Make more memory available by closing programs that you are not
   using.

<LI>Increase the random-access memory (RAM) on your computer. Microsoft
   Access requires a minimum of 12 megabytes of RAM, but additional RAM
   may improve performance.

<LI>Do not use any of the RAM for a RAM disk.

<LI>Periodically, delete unnecessary files, compact your databases, and then
   defragment your hard disk with the Disk Defragmenter. Defragmenting
   keeps files in contiguous clusters on your hard disk, making file access
   quicker. If you do not defragment your hard disk, the time it takes for
   Windows to retrieve your files may increase because Windows may have
   to go to several physical locations on the disk to retrieve the entire
   file.
<P>
   To run the Disk Defragmenter, on the taskbar, click the Start button,
   point to Programs, point to Accessories, point to System Tools, and
   then click Disk Defragmenter.

<LI>The default virtual memory setting used by Windows should perform
   optimally. However, in some situations, adjusting virtual memory
   parameters can improve performance. If you have already tried deleting
   unnecessary files, and you still have a performance problem, try
   changing the default virtual memory setting if:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - You do not have much disk space available on the drive that is
      currently being used for virtual memory, and another local drive with
      space is available.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - Another local drive is available that is faster than the current
      drive (unless that disk is heavily used).
</PRE><P>
   You may also get better performance by specifying that the disk space
   available for virtual memory cannot be less than 25 megabytes (MB),
   minus available RAM. For example, if your computer has 8 MB of RAM, you
   should specify at least 17 MB of virtual memory. You may want to specify
   more if you are running several large programs.
<P>
   To change the virtual memory parameters, in Control Panel, double-click
   the System icon. In the System Properties dialog box, click the
   Performance tab, click the Virtual Memory button, and then click "Let Me
   Specify My Own Virtual Memory Settings." Specify a different hard disk,
   or enter a value in the Minimum box that is no less than 25 minus your
   available RAM.

<LI>When you are using databases that other users do not need to share,
   install Microsoft Access and all your databases on your local hard disk
   rather than on a network server.

<LI>Create only as many indexes as necessary. Although indexes can speed
   access to data, it is possible to have so many indexes on a table that
   it is slow adding, deleting, and updating records.

<LI>Create indexes for joined fields.

<LI>In a multiple-field index, use only as many fields in the index as
   necessary.

<LI>If you have a wallpaper (full-screen background) bitmap on your Windows
   desktop, replace it with a solid color or pattern bitmap, or no bitmap
   at all.

<LI>Open a code module window and on the Run menu, click Compile All
   Modules. Then, on the File menu, click Save All Modules.

<LI>Open a code module window, choose Compile All Modules from the Run
   menu, and then choose Save All Modules from the File menu.
