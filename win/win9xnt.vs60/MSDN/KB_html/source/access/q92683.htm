<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access versions 1.0, 1.1, 2.0, 7.0, 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
If you have a form based on a query, and the query contains multiple
fields with the same name (such as FieldA from Table1 and FieldA from
Table2), the control(s) on the form that are bound to that field name
will be blank or may display the "#Name?" error.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Because the same field name appears multiple times in the query that the
form is based on, Microsoft Access does not know which field to link to
the control(s). Therefore, instead of making an assumption about which
field to bind to, it leaves the control(s) linked to duplicate field names
blank or displays the "#Name?" error in the control.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To correct this behavior, rename the field in the query.
<P>
To change a field name in a query, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>In a query's Design view, place the insertion point in front of the
   first letter of the field name in the query design grid.

<P><LI>Type the new name followed by a colon. Delete any names assigned by
   Microsoft Access, but do not delete the field name or expression.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: Changing a field name in a query's Design view changes the heading
in the query's Datasheet view and the field name in a form or report based
on the query. However, the underlying field name in the table does not
change.
<P>
<P><h2>REFERENCES</h2>
 
<P>
For more information about changing a field name in a query, search the
Help Index for "query design grid," or ask the Microsoft Access 97 Office
Assistant.
