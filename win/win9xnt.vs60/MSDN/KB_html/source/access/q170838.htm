<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multiuser skills.
<P>
The detail section of a report can grow and shrink vertically if you set
its CanGrow and CanShrink properties to Yes. However, line controls do not
have these properties and cannot grow or shrink as the detail section does.
This article demonstrates how to use the Line method to draw a line that
can grow and shrink as the detail section does.
<P>
This article assumes that you are familiar with Visual Basic for
Applications and with creating Microsoft Access applications using the
programming tools provided with Microsoft Access. For more information
about Visual Basic for Applications, please refer to your version of the
"Building Applications with Microsoft Access" manual.
<P>
NOTE: Visual Basic for Applications is called Access Basic in Microsoft
Access version 2.0. For more information about Access Basic, please refer
to the "Building Applications" manual.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Line method accepts two sets of coordinates. The first set (X1,Y1)
determines the top left position, which is the starting point of the line.
The second set (X2,Y2) determines the bottom right position, which is the
end point of the line. The X1 and X2 arguments for a vertical line always
have the same value, because these arguments specify how far from the left
margin the line is printed. However, the values of the Y1 and Y2 arguments
of a vertical line differ, and that difference specifies the height of the
line.
<P>
Because a report's detail section can grow or shrink to varying sizes, you
can set the Y2 argument to a value that is greater than the expected
maximum height of the detail section. Thus, the line is never shorter than
the height of the detail section.
<P>
NOTE: Microsoft Access has a limitation of 22 inches for the height of a
control or section. You will receive an overflow error if you try to set
the Y2 argument to a value greater than 22 inches. If your detail section
grows in excess of 22 inches, Microsoft Access will not be able to draw the
line for the remainder of the section.
<P>
The following steps demonstrate how to use the Line method to
programmatically draw a line in a report's detail section and make
it the same height as the section.

<OL><P><LI>Open the sample database Northwind.mdb (or NWIND.MDB in version 2.0)
   and create a blank new report based on the Employees table.

<P><LI>Set the report's Width property to 5 in.

<P><LI>On the View menu, click Sorting And Grouping. Enter the following in
   the Sorting And Grouping window, and then close it:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Field/Expression: EmployeeID (Or Employee ID in Microsoft Access 2.0)
      Sort Order: Ascending
      Group Header: Yes
</PRE>
<P><LI>If the field list is not displayed, click the Field List on the
   View menu to display it, and then drag the Notes field from the field
   list to the report's detail section.

<P><LI>Delete the label of the Notes text box by selecting the label, and then
   pressing the DELETE key.

<P><LI>Set the properties of Notes text box as follows:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Name: Notes
      ControlSource: Notes
      CanGrow: Yes
      CanShrink: Yes
      Left: 0.2 in
      Top: 0.166
      Width: 4.6042 in
      Height: 0.166 in
</PRE>
<P><LI>Select the horizontal Detail bar to select the detail section of the
   report. Set the following properties for the detail section:
<P>
<P><PRE>      CanGrow: Yes
      CanShrink: Yes
      Height: 0.5 in.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Set the detail section's OnPrint property to the following event
   procedure:
<P>
<P><PRE>       Private Sub Detail_Print(Cancel As Integer, PrintCount As Integer)
<PRE></PRE>          Dim X1 As Single, Y1 As Single
          Dim X2 As Single, Y2 As Single
          Dim Color As Long

          ' Specify unit of measurement for coordinates on a page...
          Me.ScaleMode = 5 ' Specify that measurement occur in inches.

          ' Set line to print 5 inches from the left margin.
          X1 = 5
          X2 = 5

          ' Set line to print from the top of the detail section
          ' to a maximum height of 22 inches.
          Y1 = 0
          Y2 = 22
          Me.DrawWidth = 25 ' Width of the line (in pixels).
          Color = RGB(0, 0, 0)  ' Use black line color.

          ' Draw the line with the Line method.
          Me.Line (X1, Y1)-(X2, Y2), Color
       End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>Preview the report. Note that the height of the vertical line to the
   right of the Notes field is the same as the height of the detail
   section.
