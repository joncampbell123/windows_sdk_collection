<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Novice: Requires knowledge of the user interface on single-user computers.
<P>
In Microsoft Access 7.0 and 97, a single action, such as clicking the mouse
or pressing a key, can trigger several different events that occur in a
particular order. Knowing when and in what order events occur can help you
to create macros and procedures that run in response to specific actions.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The sample database Orders.mdb has two forms called ShowEvents and
EventHistory that can help you learn the order of events in Microsoft
Access. If you use the ShowEvents form, Microsoft Access automatically
opens the EventHistory form and displays all the form and control events in
order as they occur in the ShowEvents form. For example, as you click the
mouse, select a field, press TAB to move through controls, or move from
record to record in the ShowEvents form, these events are listed in the
EventHistory form.
<P>
The listing of events is accomplished by an event procedure called
ShowEvent that is assigned to all form and control event properties in the
ShowEvents form. Each time the ShowEvent procedure is called, it sets the
value of a text box control in the EventHistory form to include the event
that has just occurred in the ShowEvents form.
<P>

<P>
For more information about event order, search the Help Index for "order of
events," or ask the Microsoft Access 97 Office Assistant.
