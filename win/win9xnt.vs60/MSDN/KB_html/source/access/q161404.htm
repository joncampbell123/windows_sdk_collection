The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Novice: Requires knowledge of the user interface on single-user computers.
<P>
After you run the Setup program for Microsoft Access 97 or Microsoft Office
97, Professional Edition, your earlier-version Microsoft Access run-time
application does not start.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When you ran the Setup program, you answered Yes to one of the following
questions, depending on which program you installed:
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Office 97, Professional Edition</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>      Remove ALL old Office 4.x and 95 components now?

</PRE><h3>Microsoft Access 97</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>      Remove ALL old Access components now?

</PRE><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this problem, after you have installed Microsoft Access 97,
rerun Setup for your custom run-time application, and then click Reinstall
in the Maintenance Program dialog box.
<P>
To prevent this problem from occurring at all, answer No to the question
"Remove ALL old Office 4.x and 95 components now?" or "Remove ALL old
Access components now?" when you run the Microsoft Office 97, Professional
Edition or Microsoft Access 97 Setup program. You can selectively remove
other old Microsoft Office components by running the Microsoft Office 97
Upgrade Wizard, OffCln97.exe, in the \ValuPack\Offclean folder on the
Microsoft Office 97 compact disc.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Setup program searches your hard drive for files from earlier versions
of Microsoft Office products, and asks you if you want to remove them. If
you answer Yes, the Microsoft Access files that you need to start your run-
time application are removed from your computer.
<P>
In addition to removing your old files, the Setup program changes the
shortcut that starts your run-time application. Instead of calling
Msaccess.exe, the shortcut refers to Msarnreg.exe.
<P>
NOTE: This problem may not happen if you have Microsoft Access 2.0 or 7.0
set up on your computer. The Microsoft Access 97 or Microsoft Office 97,
Professional Edition Setup program may correctly locate and remove the
Microsoft Access 2.0 or 7.0 files and leave your run-time application
intact. However, to be certain that your run-time application will start,
use the Microsoft Office 97 Upgrade Wizard to remove earlier versions of
Microsoft Access.
<P>
If you want to selectively remove earlier versions of Microsoft Office
components to free up disk space, you can run the Microsoft Office 97
Upgrade Wizard on the Microsoft Office 97 compact disc. Start the Wizard in
one of the following ways:

<UL><LI>In Windows Explorer or in File Manager, locate the \ValuPack\Offclean
   folder on the Microsoft Office 97 compact disc, and then double-click
   OffCln97.exe.

<LI>In Microsoft Windows 95 or Microsoft Windows NT Workstation 4.0, click
   Run on the Start menu, and then type
   &lt;drive&gt;:\ValuPack\Offclean\OffCln97.exe, where &lt;drive&gt; is the letter of
   your CD-ROM drive.

<LI>In Microsoft Windows NT Workstation 3.51 File Manager or Program
   Manager, click Run on the File menu, and then type
   &lt;drive&gt;:\ValuPack\Offclean\OffCln97.exe, where &lt;drive&gt; is the letter of
   your CD-ROM drive.
<P>
</UL>The Microsoft Office 97 Upgrade Wizard walks you through the steps of
removing old Microsoft Office components and enables you to select which
programs, and even which individual files, you want to remove.
<P>

Office components, open the ValuPk8.hlp Help file in the \ValuPack folder
on the Office 97 compact disc, and then click the "Microsoft Office 97
Upgrade Wizard" link.
