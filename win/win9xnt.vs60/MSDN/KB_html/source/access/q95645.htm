The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access versions 1.0, 1.1, 2.0, 7.0, 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Novice: Requires knowledge of the user interface on single-user computers.
<P>
The AutoRepeat property for command buttons does not work in conjunction
with the GoToRecord/Next macro action for moving to successive records on
a form. In other words, if your form uses command buttons instead of the
record selector buttons to move from record to record, the AutoRepeat
property does not repeatedly run a macro that performs a GoToRecord/Next
action.
<P>
Also, the AutoRepeat property fails under the same circumstances when you
use the DoMenuItem/Form/Records/GoTo/Next macro action. To rerun the macro,
you must click the command button again.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This is correct behavior for these macro actions. Here are two points that
need clarification before the cause can be explained:

<UL><LI>OnClick property: The macro under the OnClick property of a command
   button normally will not run until you push and let up the command
   button with the mouse pointer in the command button's region. The
   exception is when the command button's AutoRepeat property is set to
   Yes. In this case, the macro set for the OnClick property of the
   command button runs when the button is pushed and the mouse pointer
   is in the command button's region.
<P>
   NOTE: The OnClick property is called the OnPush property in version 1.x.

<LI>Focus: Several macro actions change the focus. For example,
   GoToControl, GoToRecord, OpenForm, OpenTable, and ApplyFilter
   change the focus.
<P>
   Therefore, if a command button's OnClick property macro changes the
   focus, for example, to the next record, then the command button has lost
   the focus; that is, when you click the command button, the click does
   not apply to that command button anymore because the focus has changed.
   It's as if you had moved the mouse pointer off the command button while
   pressing the mouse button, as if the command button moved out from under
   the mouse pointer right before you pressed the mouse button.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.

<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start Microsoft Access.

<P><LI>Open the sample database Northwind.mdb (or NWIND.MDB in versions 1.x
    and 2.0).

<P><LI>Create a new macro as follows and save it as AutoRepeatTest:
<P>
<PRE>       Macro Name      Action
       --------------------------
       AutoRepeatTest  GotoRecord

       AutoRepeatTest Actions
       --------------------------
       GoToRecord
          Object Type:  Form
          Object Name:  Customers
          Record:       Next

</PRE><P><LI>Open the Customers form in Design view.

<P><LI>Drag the macro you have just created onto the form to create a
    command button.

<P><LI>Set the AutoRepeat property of the command button to Yes. Note that
    the command button's OnClick property is set to the name of the
    macro.

<P><LI>View the Customers form in Form view to browse the form and click the
    command button. Note that each time you click the command button, the
    record selector moves to the next record. When you click and hold down
    the command button, you would expect Microsoft Access to scroll rapidly
    to the last record in the table, but this does not happen. Instead, the
    record selector moves to the next record only, regardless of the
    command button's AutoRepeat property setting.
<P>
    However, if you add a macro that uses a different macro action, such
    as Beep, to the form, the AutoRepeat action works as expected. This is
    because Beep does not change the focus.
