<PRE>1. Q. I receive a "#Error?" message in a control when I run my form
      or report. What does it mean?

   A. This value means that Microsoft Access cannot evaluate an
      expression. The most common cause of this error is a circular
      reference. For example, a control with the following Name and
      ControlSource properties produces the error:

          Name: FirstName
          ControlSource: =[FirstName] &amp; " " &amp; [LastName]

      When Microsoft Access evaluates [FirstName] in the
      ControlSource property, it looks for a control by that name on
      the form. However, the control has just referenced itself. This
      is called a circular reference.

      To resolve the circular reference problem, change the Name
      property to FullName. Because there is no longer a control
      named FirstName, Microsoft Access looks for a field called
      FirstName when evaluating the expression set for the
      ControlSource property.

      For additional information about "#Error?" and other error
      values, order item number <B><A href="../access/q112103.htm">Q112103</A></B> by selecting the FastTips
      Technical Library option from the FastTips Main Menu.

2. Q. Why is every other page of my report blank, and how can I
      prevent these blank pages from being printed?

   A. Blank pages are printed when the total width of your report
      exceeds the width of the paper specified in the Page Setup
      dialog box. For example, blank pages are printed if your report
      form is 8 inches wide, the left and right margins are 1 inch
      wide (for a total width of 10 inches), but the paper size
      specified in the Print Setup dialog box is only 8.5 inches
      wide.

      With these print settings, if controls such as text boxes
      extend beyond 8.5 inches, the controls are printed on a second
      page. Otherwise, you receive a warning message stating that
      some pages may be blank. Blank pages generated after the
      warning are not counted in the total pages of your report.

      For additional information about preventing blank pages, order
      item number <B><A href="../access/q136459.htm">Q136459</A></B> by selecting the FastTips Technical Library
      option from the FastTips Main Menu.

3. Q. How do I cancel a report that does not contain any records?

   A. Microsoft Access for Windows 95 has a new report property
      called OnNoData. As its name implies, the macro or event
      procedure set for this property is triggered when a report
      without data is previewed or printed. For example, you can set
      the OnNoData property to a macro that contains two actions: a
      MsgBox action that tells the user there is no data and a
      CancelEvent action.

      For more information about canceling reports without data,
      search on the phrase "How do I cancel a report without records"
      then view "How Do I: Cancel the printing of a report when it
      doesn't contain any records" using the Answer Wizard from the
      Microsoft Access Help menu.

4. Q. How can I get my combo box or list box to default to the first
      item in the list?

   A. When you move to a new record on a form that has a combo box or
      a list box, the combo box is blank, or the list box does not
      have a value selected. The combo box or list box may have a
      table or query defined in its RowSource property that provides
      the list of items to be displayed in the box. Because the data
      in the underlying RowSource property varies with the addition
      or deletion of records, it is difficult to know what item will
      appear at the top of the list when the form is used. However,
      in Microsoft Access version 2.0 and later, you can use the
      ItemData method to cause a combo box or list box to default to
      any row. To cause the first row to be selected automatically,
      set the control's DefaultValue property to

          =[&lt;MyCombo&gt;].[ItemData](0)

      where &lt;MyCombo&gt; is the name of your control.

5. Q. How do I print a report for only the current record on the
      form?

   A. Use the Where argument of the OpenReport action to print a
      report for only the current record of a form. For example, if
      you have a form called MyForm and a primary key field named ID
      in both the form and the report, use the following expression
      in the Where argument:

          [ID]=Forms![MyForm]![ID]

      For more information about printing the current record, search
      on the phrase "How do I print a report for the current record
      on a form" then view "How Do I: Create a command button that
      prints the current record" using the Answer Wizard from the
      Microsoft Access Help menu.

6. Q. How can I check for duplicate records immediately after I enter
      a value in a primary key field?

   A. Typically, Microsoft Access does not check the values in
      primary key fields for duplicates until you move to the next
      record. If you want to check for duplicate values immediately
      after entering a value in a primary key field, use a macro in
      the field's BeforeUpdate property. The macro should use the
      DLookup() function to check for duplicates and then display an
      appropriate message.

      For an example of this macro, open the sample database
      Northwind.mdb, and open the Customers form in Design view. Note
      that the BeforeUpdate property of the CustomerID control is set
      to the Customer.ValidateID macro. To see the contents of the
      macro, click the Builder button next to the BeforeUpdate
      property.

      For additional information about using the DLookup() function,
      order item number <B><A href="../access/q136122.htm">Q136122</A></B> by selecting the FastTips Technical
      Library option from the FastTips Main Menu.
