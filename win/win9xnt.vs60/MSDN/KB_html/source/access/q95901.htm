The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access versions 1.0, 1.1, 2.0, 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Novice: Requires knowledge of the user interface on single-user computers.
<P>
When you preview a form or report, you may receive the following error
message.
<P>
In Microsoft Access for Windows 95 version 7.0:
<P>
<PRE>   This document was previously formatted for the printer &lt;printer name&gt;
   on &lt;printer port&gt;, but that printer isn't available. Do you want to
   use the default printer &lt;printer name&gt; on &lt;printer port&gt;?

</PRE>In Microsoft Access versions 1.x and 2.0:
<P>
<PRE>   An error occurred while attempting to retrieve printer
   information for the &lt;printer name&gt; on &lt;printer port&gt;.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This error occurs when the printer driver that was in use when the form or
report was created no longer exists on the system. If you print the form or
report rather than preview it, you receive the following error message
from Commdlg.dll.
<P>
In version 7.0:
<P>
<PRE>   This document was previously formatted for the printer &lt;printer name&gt;
   on &lt;printer port&gt;, but that printer isn't available. Do you want to
   use the default printer &lt;printer name&gt; on &lt;printer port&gt;?

</PRE>In versions 1.x and 2.0:
<P>
<PRE>   This document was previously formatted for the printer
   &lt;previous printer name&gt; on &lt;PORT&gt;, but that printer is not available.
   Use the default printer &lt;default printer name&gt; on &lt;PORT&gt;.

</PRE><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
NOTE: This problem no longer occurs in Microsoft Access 97.
<P>
In version 7.0:
<P>
When you receive the error message, click OK or Setup. If you click OK,
Microsoft Access resets and saves the report using the default printer.
If you click Setup, you can assign a new specific printer to the report.
<P>
In versions 1.x and 2.0:
<P>
Open the form or report in Design view, and make sure that the selected
printer is correct. If Specific Printer is selected in the Print Setup
dialog box, the printer driver that was in use when the form or report
was created must be installed on the system. Save the form or report
before you preview or print it.
<P>
Selecting Default Printer in the Print Setup dialog box before you save a
new form or report makes the form or report more portable, because the form
or report will use the default printer on any system when that form or
report is previewed or printed.
