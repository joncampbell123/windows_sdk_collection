The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access versions 2.0, 7.0, 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Novice: Requires knowledge of the user interface on single-user computers.
<P>
You cannot leave a field blank, or Null, in a table's Datasheet view if the
field has a validation rule.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior only occurs when adding a new record with two fields, one of
which has a data type of AutoNumber (or Counter in version 2.0).
<P>
This behavior differs from that of Microsoft Access version 1.x. In
Microsoft Access 1.x, a Null value is accepted for a field even if "Or Is
Null" is not part of the validation rule.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Include "Or Is Null" as part of the validation rule for the field. For
example, a validation rule for a text field could be:
<P>
<PRE>   "A" Or "B" Or Is Null

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create the following new table and save it as Table1:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Table: Table1
      ---------------------------------------------------
      Field Name: ID
<PRE></PRE>         Data Type: AutoNumber (or Counter in version 2.0)
      Field Name: Code
         Data Type: Text
         Validation Rule: "A" Or "B" Or Is Null

</PRE><P><LI>View the table in Datasheet view.

<P><LI>Select the Code field. Type "A" (without the quotation marks) and press
   ENTER. Note that you can move to the next record.

<P><LI>In the next record, press TAB to move to the third record. Note that
   you cannot move to the next record because the Code field cannot
   initially be Null. This is because there is only one user input field
   defined in this table, and the record cannot be saved until it has
   received some input.

<P><LI>Select the Code field in the second record. Type "A" (without the
   quotation marks) and press ENTER. Delete the "A" from the field, and
   press TAB. Note that you can move to the next record now because the
   record was initially saved with data.
