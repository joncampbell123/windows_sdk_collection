Novice: Requires knowledge of the user interface on single-user computers.
<P>
The Microsoft Access Report Wizard for mailing labels makes it quick and
easy to create a report design for many standard mailing labels. However,
sometimes you may have difficulty getting the labels to print correctly on
your printer. This article discusses some hints and suggestions for
getting labels to print correctly.
<P>
NOTE: Microsoft Access 97 and 7.0 have a new feature called the Label
Wizards. The Label Wizard provides a Customize button that enables you to
define your own label size and to save it as a template. Once saved, you
can edit or duplicate your custom label templates. Defining your label is
easy with the new graphical interface for choosing sizes, margins, columns
and type offset.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Access Report Wizard for mailing labels creates report
specifications for standard mailing labels. However, in order to do so, it
makes some assumptions about your printer which may not be true. In
particular, it assumes that it can print within a certain distance of each
edge of the paper. Every Windows print driver can have a different
"printable region," which is the rectangle on the printed page that the
application can print into. This rectangle may be smaller than the
rectangle that the physical printer can print because of space and
efficiency considerations in the print driver. Therefore you may not be
able to print labels as close to the edge of the paper as you would like.
<P>
In general, the Report Wizard assumes that it can print within .25 inch of
the edge of the paper. If you find that some of the text in your labels is
being cut off or is not being printed at all, try going into design mode
for the report and moving text items until all of the text prints. For
example, select all the controls and move the entire group down a little
within the detail section to adjust for a top label being missed. You may
have to make the items smaller, choose a smaller font, and move them
closer together to get everything to fit without the label being cut off
at either the top or the bottom of the printed page.
<P>
If your printer has such a large top margin that you cannot move your text
items down far enough (or if doing so results in a visually crowded
label), the next thing to do is change the Print Setup margins so that the
first label on each page is not used. To do this, choose Print Setup and
add the height of your labels to the top margin provided by the Report
Wizard. For example, if you are using 1 inch labels, and the top margin is
.03 inch, change it to 1.03 inches to skip the first label on the page. If
you are having trouble with the last line of the last label getting cut
off, you can use the same technique on the bottom margin to cause the last
label on the page to be skipped.
<P>
Another common problem is that some labels come on sheets that are 12
inches tall, whereas the print driver only recognizes 11-inch paper. In
this case, you must ignore the last label on the page and use the labels
that fall within the first 11 inches.
