The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access versions 1.0, 1.1, 2.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multiuser skills.
<P>
This article demonstrates how to create sample Access Basic functions that
you can use to make calls to the media control interface (MCI) using the
mciSendString() function to run a CD player application from Microsoft
Access.
<P>
NOTE: These sample functions require that you use Windows version 3.1, or
Multimedia Windows version 3.0, or Windows 95 and a CD-ROM drive that
supports MCI.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The sample program below uses several functions to control basic CD-ROM
drive features such as stop, play, and eject. The functions can be used in
any CD-ROM application you create. The sample program below is not a
complete application, but is rather a basis you can use to create a full-
featured application.
<P>
The simplest way to use these functions is to create a form with five
command buttons on it. Have each of the buttons call one of the five sample
functions below with its OnPush property.
<P>
To create these functions, create a new Access Basic module and enter the
following Declarations and functions.
<P>
NOTE: In the following sample code, an underscore (_) is used as a line-
continuation character. Remove the underscore from the end of the line when
re-creating this code in Access Basic.
<P>
NOTE: You may have these Microsoft Windows API functions defined in an
existing Microsoft Access library or module; therefore, your declarations
may be duplicates causing a duplicate procedure name error message. There
are two resolutions to this error:

<UL><LI>Remove or comment out the duplicated declarations statements.

<LI>Use function aliasing by replacing the phrase "alias_" throughout the
   code below with your own unique aliasing characters. This method allows
   you to remove the other module and not lose the declarations for the API
   functions in the new module.
<P>
</UL>For more information about aliasing see page 369 of the "Building
Applications" manual.

   '********* Pause Function **********

   Function CDPause () As Integer

   End Function

</PRE>Note that these functions are only a sample; there are many other functions
that can be implemented with mciSendString(). For example, the Position
command returns the current track number that is being played. By using the
Position command with the timer function described in article <B><A href="../access/q95924.htm">Q95924</A></B>, "How
to Implement a Timer," you can create a dynamically updated readout of the
current track number being played.
