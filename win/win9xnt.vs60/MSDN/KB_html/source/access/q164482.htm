The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
When you try to delete or update a record on an Active Server Page (ASP),
the record is not deleted or the change is not made. However, you do not
receive an error message letting you know that the deletion or modification
failed. If you try to delete or update the same record when the form is
open in Microsoft Access 97, you receive an error message letting you know
the record could not be deleted or the change could not be made.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Your form is based on a table that is participating in referential
integrity, contains required fields, or contains fields with validation
rules.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Records will not be deleted if the table that the record is in is on the
one-side of a one-to-many relationship and the many-side table contains
related records.
<P>
Updates to fields will not be committed if they do not conform to the
Required and Validation Rule properties of the table that the form is based
on. Updates to fields participating in referential integrity on the one-
side of a one-to-many relationship will not be committed if there are
related records in the many-side table.
<P>
This behavior can also occur if both of the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>The ASP files are located on a server running a version of Microsoft
   Personal Web Server that is earlier than 4.0 or a version of Microsoft
   Internet Information Server that is earlier than 4.0.

<LI>You are trying to update a field with data that is longer than
   the size of that field. For example, you are trying to enter a
   15-character string into a text field whose FieldSize property is
   set to 10.
<P>
</UL>If you try any of these scenarios directly in Microsoft Access, you
will be prevented from doing so and you will be warned. In the ASP form,
however, there is no error trapping and no warnings; the attempted action
fails without warning.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Open the sample database Northwind.mdb in Microsoft Access 97.

<P><LI>Open the Customers form and try to delete the first record. Note that
   you receive the following error message:
<P>
<P><PRE>      The record cannot be deleted or changed because table 'Orders'
      includes related records.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Click OK to the error message.

<P><LI>Save the form as an Active Server Page.

<P><LI>Open the newly exported form on your Web browser.

<P><LI>Scroll down to the bottom of the form and click Delete.

<P><LI>In the "Press OK to delete current record" box, click OK. Record two
   becomes the current record.

<P><LI>Scroll down to the bottom of the page, and select the record selector
   to return to the previous record. Note that the record you tried to
   delete still exists.
