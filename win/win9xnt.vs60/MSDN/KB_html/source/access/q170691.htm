The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multiuser skills.
<P>
NOTE: This article contains information about editing ASP files. It assumes
that you are familiar with Active Server Pages, Visual Basic Scripting, and
editing HTML files. Microsoft Access Technical Support engineers do not
support modification of any HTML, HTX, IDC, or ASP files.
<P>
When you export a form to ASP and view the ASP file in a browser, label
controls with access keys are displayed with their literal caption text.
For example, a form may contain a label control whose caption is
&amp;Supplier ID. When you view the form in Form view in Microsoft Access, the
caption appears as Supplier ID with an underscore under the "S."  However,
the caption appears as &amp;Supplier ID when you view the corresponding ASP
file.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Access keys are not supported in a form that has been exported to ASP.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
When you export a form to ASP, two files are created: the frame file and
the layout file. The name of the layout file contains the name of the form
followed by the letters "ALX."
<P>
The only way to remove the ampersand (&amp;) from the label caption is to
manually edit the layout file. For example, the caption line in the file
Suppliersalx.asp is
<P>
<PRE>   &lt;PARAM NAME="Caption" VALUE="&amp;Supplier ID"&gt;

</PRE>Note that the value of the caption includes the ampersand.
<P>
You can open the ASP file in a text editor, such as Notepad, and change the
caption line, for example:
<P>
<PRE>   &lt;PARAM NAME="Caption" VALUE="Supplier ID"&gt;

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start Microsoft Access 97 and open the sample database Northwind.mdb.

<P><LI>Open the Suppliers form in Design View.

<P><LI>Change the Caption property of SupplierIDLabel to "&amp;Supplier ID"
    (without the quotation marks). An underscore now appears under the "S"
    in "Supplier."

<P><LI>Close and save the form.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Save As/Export.

<P><LI>In the Save As dialog box, click "To an External File or Database," and
    then click OK.

<P><LI>In the "Save Form 'Suppliers' In" dialog box, select Microsoft Active
    Server Pages (*.asp) in the Save As Type box, and save the
    Suppliers.asp file in a folder on your Web server where you have
    Execute permission. Click Export.

<P><LI>In the Microsoft Active Server Pages Output Options dialog box, type a
    valid System DSN on your Web server in the Data Source Name box, and
    type the uniform resource locator (URL) on your server where the ASP
    file will be located in the Server URL box. Click OK.

<P><LI>Start Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0 or later, or another Web browser
    program.

<P><LI>Type the URL in the address box of your Web browser to view
    Suppliers.asp, for example <B>http://MyServer/Aspsamp/Suppliers.asp.</B> Note
    that the URL depends upon where your files are located on the Web
    server computer.

<P><LI>View the ASP file in a Web browser. Note that the Supplier ID label is
    displayed as:
<P>
       &amp;Supplier ID
