The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access versions 1.0, 1.1, 2.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multiuser skills.
<P>
When running a query against an ORACLE table, or updating a record in an
ORACLE table, the error message
<P>
<PRE>   Statement was longer then allowable maximum 2000+ chars

</PRE>is displayed if the table and field names are very long or the query is
very complex.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This is a problem with SQORA.DLL, the ORACLE ODBC Driver.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Obtain and install the updated driver, or use queries to do updates, rather
than updating records while the ORACLE table is in Datasheet view. The
query should yield only the columns to be updated.
<P>
For complex queries, reduce the number of tables or joins in the query and
reduce the number of fields used or shown in the query.
<P>
These workarounds reduce the length of the SQL statements.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the ORACLE ODBC driver
shipped with Microsoft Access versions 1.1 and 2.0 and Visual Basic for
Windows version 3.0 - Professional Edition. An updated driver that corrects
this specific problem is available from Microsoft.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
