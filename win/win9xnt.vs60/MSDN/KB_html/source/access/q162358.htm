The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
When you try to use a Microsoft Access 7.0 wizard with a network
(workstation) setup of Microsoft Access 7.0, you may receive one
of the following error messages:
<P>
<PRE>   This feature isn't installed.

   -or-

   Microsoft Access Can't Find the Wizard or there is a syntax error in
   the declaration section of the Visual Basic module.

</PRE>For information about troubleshooting these error messages with a local
setup of Microsoft Access 7.0, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../access/q162357.htm">Q162357</A></B>
   TITLE     : ACC95: Err "Microsoft Access Can't Find the Wizard" (Local
               Setup)

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
There are several possible causes for these errors:

<UL><LI>You have read-only permissions for the Workdir folder.
<LI>A wizard database file is missing.
<LI>A type library file is missing or misregistered.
<LI>A file needed to run the wizards is mismatched or corrupted.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Each of the possible causes has its own resolution. If you are unsure what
is causing the error, try each resolution in order and check to see if the
wizard is fixed after each one.
<P>
<P><h3>You Have Read-Only Permissions for the Workdir Folder</h3>
 
<P>
If you run Microsoft Access 7.0 on a network, you must have both Read and
Write permissions for the Workdir folder on the network server; under
certain circumstances, you may also need Create permission.
<P>
For more information about user privileges required for the Workdir
folder, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../access/q136140.htm">Q136140</A></B>
   TITLE     : ACC95: Privileges Needed for Workdir Folder

</PRE>You can test if the error is caused by incorrect permissions for the
Workdir folder by logging on to your workstation as a user with network
administrator or supervisor privileges. Then start Microsoft Access and
test the wizard again. If the wizard works correctly, ask your network
administrator to verify that your user logon has correct permissions for
the Workdir folder.
<P>
<P><h3>A Wizard Database File Is Missing</h3>
 
<P>
If you still receive an error message when you are logged on to your
workstation as a network administrator or supervisor, verify that Workdir
is not a read-only folder. Also verify that the following files exist in
the Workdir folder, and that the read-only attribute is not set for any of
them:
<P>
<PRE>   Msau7032.dll
   Wd95acc.tlb
   Wzcnf70.mda
   Wzdat70.mdt
   Wzlib70.mda
   Wzmain70.mda
   Wztool.mda

</PRE>If any of these files are missing from the Workdir folder, run a complete
Administrative setup on the network server, and then rerun the Setup
program for your workstation to reinstall Microsoft Access 7.0.
<P>
<P><h3>A Type Library File Is Missing or Misregistered</h3>
 
<P>
Search your hard drive for the file Dao2532.tlb. The file is set up by
default in the \Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Dao folder
(for Microsoft Windows 95) or in the \Winnt\Msapps\Dao folder (for
Microsoft Windows NT version 3.51). In Microsoft Windows NT version 4.0
the file may be in either folder, depending on how the operating system
was installed.
<P>
If You Find Dao2532.tlb on Your Computer:
<P>
Run the Setup program with a command-line option that resets the Windows
Registry settings for Microsoft Access:

<OL><P><LI>In Microsoft Windows 95 or Windows NT version 4.0, click the Start
   button on the taskbar, and then click Run.
<P>
   In Microsoft Windows NT 3.51, in Program Manager or File Manager, click
   Run on the File menu.

<P><LI>Type a command to run the Setup program using the /y switch, for
   example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      &lt;Drive&gt;:\setup /y
</PRE><P>
   Replace &lt;Drive&gt; with the drive letter for your network server.

<P><LI>In the Installation Maintenance dialog box, click Reinstall.

<P><LI>When the Setup program is finished, start Microsoft Access and try to
   run the wizard.
<P>
</OL>If You Do Not Find Dao2532.tlb on Your Computer:
<P>
Rerun the Setup program and reinstall Microsoft Access 7.0:

<OL><P><LI>Close all applications, including the Microsoft Office toolbar.

<P><LI>Start the Setup program.
<P>
   In Microsoft Windows 95 or Windows NT 4.0:
<P>
<P><PRE>      a. Click the Start button on the taskbar, point to Settings, and
<PRE></PRE>         then click Control Panel.

      b. In Control Panel, double-click Add/Remove Programs.

      c. In the Add/Remove Programs Properties dialog box, click Microsoft
         Access 7.0 or Microsoft Office Professional, and then click
         Add/Remove.

   In Microsoft Windows NT 3.51:

      a. Open the program group for Microsoft Access or Microsoft Office.

      b. Double-click the Setup icon.

</PRE><P><LI>In the Installation Maintenance dialog box, click Reinstall.

<P><LI>When the Setup program is finished, start Microsoft Access and try to
   run the wizard.
<P>
</OL><h3>A File Needed to Run the Wizards Is Mismatched or Corrupted</h3>
 
<P>
Once you determine that none of the previous steps resolve the error
message you receive when you try to run a wizard, you must remove and
reinstall Microsoft Access for Windows 95 or Microsoft Office Professional
for Windows 95.
<P>
The Setup program will not remove any Microsoft Office files that you
created from your hard drive. However, it is strongly recommended that you
back up any Microsoft Office files that are important to you before you
follow these steps.

<OL><P><LI>Remove all Microsoft Access for Windows 95 or Microsoft Office
   Professional for Windows 95 Setup files from the network server.

<P><LI>Recreate the Setup files on the network server by running an
   Administrative installation on the server.

<P><LI>Verify that the Workdir folder on the server has the correct
   permissions.

<P><LI>Delete the following files from the Windows System folder on your
   workstation's hard drive if they exist.
<P>
   NOTE: If you are using Windows Explorer, click Options on the View menu
   and verify that the Show All Files option is selected. Without that
   option, you may not see these files if they exist on your hard drive.
<P>
<P><PRE>      Msjetsql.tlb
      Msjint32.dll
      Msjt3032.dll
      Msjter32.dll
      Msrd2x32.dll
      Mswng300.dll
      Vaen232.dll
      Vba232.dll
      Vbajet32.dll
      Vbar2232.dll
      Ven2232.olb
</PRE>
<P><LI>Delete the \Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Dao folder (for
   Microsoft Windows 95) or the \Winnt\Msapps\Dao folder (for Microsoft
   Windows NT version 3.51 or 4.0) on your workstation's hard drive if it
   exists.

<P><LI>Rerun the Setup program from your network server and reinstall
   Microsoft Access for Windows 95 or Microsoft Office Professional for
   Windows 95 on your workstation.

<P><LI>Start Microsoft Access and start the wizard.
