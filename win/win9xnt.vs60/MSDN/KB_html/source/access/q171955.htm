The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
In Microsoft Access 97, on the File menu, you point to Get External Data,
and then Import, but one or more of the following applications do not
appear in the Files Of Type list box:

<UL><LI>dBASE III
<LI>dBASE IV
<LI>dBASE V
<LI>Text Files
<LI>Microsoft Excel
<P>
</UL>However, if you rerun the Microsoft Office 97 or Microsoft Access 97 setup
program, the ISAM drivers for the applications are checked as installed.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior can be caused by invalid information in the Windows registry,
or by a missing or corrupted dynamic-link library (.dll) file.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
You must uninstall (remove) and then reinstall the ISAM drivers so that
they can be reregistered properly. The following steps demonstrate how to
remove and then reinstall the dBASE, Text, and Microsoft Excel drivers so
that they will appear in the Files Of Type list box:

<OL><P><LI>Start the Microsoft Access 97 or the Microsoft Office 97 Professional
    Edition Setup program by double-clicking the Add/Remove Programs Icon
    in Control Panel.

<P><LI>On the Install/Uninstall tab, select Microsoft Office 97, Professional
    Edition or Microsoft Access 97 in the list of applications, and then
    click Add/Remove.

<P><LI>When prompted, place your compact disc into the CD-Rom drive and click
    OK.
<P>
    NOTE: If you are running setup from a network, you will not need to
    place the compact disc into the CD-ROM drive.

<P><LI>When the first screen of the Setup program appears, click Add/Remove.

<P><LI>In the Options box, select Data Access, and then click Change Option.

<P><LI>In the Data Access Options box, click Database Drivers, and then click
    Change Option.

<P><LI>Click to clear the check box for each ISAM driver that does not appear
    in the Files Of Type list box in Microsoft Access, click OK twice, and
    then click Continue.
<P>
    NOTE: If the check box for the ISAM driver is unavailable, click
    Cancel three times, click Exit Setup twice, click OK to exit the Setup
    Program, and proceed to Step 10.

<P><LI>Click Yes when asked if you want to remove the components.

<P><LI>After Setup has finished, click OK to the message that the Setup
    program has completed successfully.

<P><LI>While the Add/Remove Program Properties dialog box is still open,
    start Windows Explorer (or File Manager) and search for the following
    file names:
<P>
<PRE>    File Name       Import/Export ISAM For
    --------------------------------------
    MSEXCL35.DLL    Microsoft Excel
    MSTEXT35.DLL    Text
    MSXBSE35.DLL    dBASE

</PRE><P><LI>Rename the files. Close Windows Explorer.

<P><LI>Repeat steps 2-6 from the beginning of this section.

<P><LI>Click to select the check box for each ISAM driver that you want to
    reinstall.

<P><LI>Click OK twice, and then click Continue.

<P><LI>When the Setup program has finished updating your system, click OK.
    Close the Add/Remove Programs Properties box.

<P><LI>Return to Microsoft Access and on the File menu, point to Get
    External Data, and then click Import. The additional ISAM drivers
    should now appear in the list.
<P>
</OL>If the application that you want to import from still does not appear in
the list:

<OL><P><LI> Rename the files described above in steps 10-11.

<P><LI> Repeat steps 1-3 from the beginning of the Resolution section.

<P><LI> When the first screen of the Setup program appears, click Reinstall.

<P><LI> When the Reinstall process has finished successfully, repeat step 16.
<P>
<P><PRE>    NOTE: If the application that you want to import from still does not
    appear in the list, you will need to uninstall Microsoft Access 97
    or Microsoft Office 97 Professional Edition and then reinstall the
    application. For information about how to successfully uninstall
    and reinstall Microsoft Access 97 or Microsoft Office 97 Professional
    Edition, please see the following articles in the Microsoft Knowledge
