<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multiuser skills.
<P>
This article describes how the Microsoft Access Setup program installs
support for electronic mail (email) applications, and how you can modify
your Windows settings to support one of two different electronic mail
interface protocols: messaging application programming interface (MAPI) or
vendor independent messaging (VIM), which is used by the Lotus cc:Mail
electronic mail application.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
All of the Microsoft Office for Windows applications (Microsoft Access,
Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Mail, and Microsoft PowerPoint)
support the MAPI protocol by default. To support VIM electronic mail
systems, the applications use a MAPI-to-VIM translation dynamic-link
library (DLL) called MAPIVIM.DLL. The following diagrams demonstrate the
route Microsoft Access uses when you send electronic mail using either the
Send command from the File menu or the SendObject macro action:
<P>
<PRE>   Sending to Microsoft Mail             Sending to Lotus cc:Mail
   --------------------------            --------------------------
   Send command or SendObject            Send command or SendObject
   macro action                          macro action
       |                                     |
   MAPI.DLL                              MAPIVIM.DLL
       |                                     |
   Microsoft Mail                        VIM.DLL or SMI.DLL
                                             |
                                         cc:Mail

</PRE><h3>How Microsoft Access Installs Electronic Mail Support</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>The Microsoft Access Setup program searches the Windows WIN.INI file for
   the following setting, which indicates that a VIM-compliant email
   application (such as cc:Mail) is installed on your computer:
<P>
<P><PRE>      [Mail]
      MAPIDLL=&lt;WINDOWS&gt;\SYSTEM\MAPIVIM.DLL
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;WINDOWS&gt; is the location of your Windows program directory (for
   example, C:\WINDOWS). If Setup finds this setting, it copies the
   MAPIVIM.DLL file to your &lt;WINDOWS&gt;\SYSTEM directory and updates the
   MAPIDLL setting in your WIN.INI file to reflect the location of the new
   MAPIVIM.DLL file.
<P>
   If the MAPIDLL setting points to a different .DLL file, Microsoft Office
   applications use the MAPI functions in the specified .DLL instead of
   MAPI.DLL.

<P><LI>If Setup does not find the above MAPIDLL setting, it searches the
   WIN.INI file for the following setting, which indicates that a MAPI-
   compliant email application (such as Microsoft Mail) is installed on
   your computer:
<P>
<P><PRE>      [Mail]
      MAPI=1
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: If Setup installs MAPI support, it deletes any existing MAPIDLL
   entry from your WIN.INI file.

<P><LI>If Setup detects both MAPI and VIM on your system, it prompts you
   to select which messaging system to support.

<P><LI>If Setup finds either of the above settings, it adds the email commands
   to the Microsoft Access menus (for example, Setup adds the Send command
   to the File menu).
<P>
</OL>NOTE: the cc:Mail program directory must be part of your PATH statement. If
it is not, the email commands will not be added to your Microsoft Access
menus.
<P>
<P><h3>How to Switch from One Mail System To Another</h3>
 
<P>
When you access email from Microsoft Access, Microsoft Access searches
first for the MAPIDLL setting. If found, Microsoft Access supports VIM-
compliant email systems. If not found, Microsoft Access then searches for
the MAPI=1 setting and, if found, supports MAPI-compliant email systems.
<P>
If you work on a network that uses both MAPI- and VIM- compliant email
applications, you may want Microsoft Access to be able to switch back and
forth between the two applications. To do this, add both of the above
settings to the [Mail] section of your WIN.INI file. When you want to use a
MAPI-compliant email application, comment the MAPIDLL line to deactivate it
(to comment a line in the WIN.INI file, type a semicolon [;] at the
beginning of the line).
<P>
The following sample WIN.INI entries demonstrate this procedure:
<P>
To use a MAPI-compliant email program (such as Microsoft Mail), comment the
MAPIDLL line:
<P>
<PRE>   [Mail]
   ;MAPIDLL=&lt;WINDOWS&gt;\SYSTEM\MAPIVIM.DLL
   MAPI=1

</PRE></OL>To use a VIM-compliant email program (such as cc:Mail), remove the
semicolon (;) from the MAPIDLL line to reactivate it:
<P>
<PRE>   [Mail]
   MAPIDLL=&lt;WINDOWS&gt;\SYSTEM\MAPIVIM.DLL
   MAPI=1

</PRE>If you want to use VIM-compliant email systems but Microsoft Access did not
install the MAPIVIM.DLL file because there was no MAPIDLL line in the
WIN.INI file, you can install the MAPIVIM.DLL file manually. To do this,
copy the DECOMP.EXE file from disk 1 of your original Microsoft Access
installation disks to your Windows directory. Insert disk 5 (for 3.5-inch
disks) or disk 4 (for 5.25-inch disks) in drive A, and then type the
following command at a DOS prompt:
<P>
<PRE>   c:\windows\decomp.exe a:\mapivim.dl_c:\windows\system\mapivim.dll

</PRE>This command will install the MAPIVIMM.DLL file in your WINDOWS\SYSTEM
directory.
