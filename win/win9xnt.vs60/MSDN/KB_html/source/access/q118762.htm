<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
In order to automate tasks in Microsoft Access successfully, it is helpful
to have an understanding of the Microsoft Windows event model. Objects in
Microsoft Access respond to many types of events, such as mouse events and
keyboard events. Events are also triggered in response to record
movements. There are several ways to determine the order of events for
forms, reports, subforms, and subreports in Microsoft Access.
<P>
Below is a description of a form in sample database NWIND.MDB that allows
you to experiment with and view the order of events.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
There is a special version of the Orders form in the sample database
NWIND.MDB called the Show Events form that records each event as it
occurs. When you open the Show Events form, an accompanying form
called Event History opens as well. The Event History form lists the
events that occur in the Show Event form. As you use the mouse or
keyboard to select or change controls in the Show Events form, the
list in the Event History form changes to show all the events that
have occurred. Note the events that occur as you use the mouse and
keyboard to manipulate objects in the Show Events form. The Show
Events and Event History forms can help you to understand the concept
of events, and the order in which they occur.
<P>
The recording of events in the Show Events form is accomplished by a
function called ShowEvent(). The ShowEvent() function is called in the
event procedures of all the event properties of all the controls on
the Show Events form. The ShowEvent() function sets the value of the
text control to include the event that just occurred.
