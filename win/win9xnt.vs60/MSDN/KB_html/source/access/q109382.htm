<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Novice: Requires knowledge of the user interface on single-user computers.
<P>
This article discusses whether the Visual Basic for Applications (or
Access Basic in version 2.0) programming language is a compiled language
or an interpreted language.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Traditional compiled languages, such as C, compile human-readable source
code into machine-readable, and much faster, object code. These object
programs then need to be linked into an executable file to be used.
Syntax errors are not generally located until the code is completely
compiled, although parsing compilers are an exception to this rule.
<P>
Traditional interpreted languages, such as QBasic, use interpreters that
read each line of code and translate it into computer instructions as
you write it. An advantage of this method is that an interpreter can test
your code as you write it. In some cases this line-by-line interpretation
can be slow.
<P>
Visual Basic incorporates elements of both compiled and interpreted
languages. Visual Basic does interpret each line of code you as you write
it, but Microsoft Access performs this interpretation in the background,
and does not exhibit any performance degradation because of this
interpretation.
<P>
In addition to this interpretation, Microsoft Access also compiles your
code into a combination of compiled and interpreted code known as p-code,
or pseudocode. This p-code runs much faster than interpreted code. The
compilation takes place either when you first run the code, or when you
click Compile All on the Run menu.
<P>
Microsoft Access 97 also provides another mechanism for keeping database
applications compiled and secure.  This feature is called Make MDE File,
and it removes the text representation of your VBA code and stores just the
binary compiled p-code.
<P>
If your database contains Visual Basic code, saving your database as an
MDE file compiles all modules, removes all editable source code, and
compacts the destination database. Your Visual Basic code continues to
run, but it cannot be viewed or edited, and the size of your database is
reduced due to the removal of the code. Additionally, memory usage is
optimized, which improves performance.
<P>
Saving your database as an MDE file prevents the following actions:

<UL><LI>Viewing, modifying, or creating forms, reports, or modules in Design
   view.

<LI>Adding, deleting, or changing references to object libraries or
   databases.

<LI>Changing code using the properties or methods of the Microsoft Access or
   VBA Object models because an MDE file contains no source code.

<LI>Changing your database's VBA project name using the Options dialog box.

<LI>Importing or exporting forms, reports, or modules. However, tables,
   queries, and macros can be imported from or exported to non-MDE
   databases. Any tables, queries, or macros in an MDE database can be
   imported into another database, but no forms, reports, or modules can be
   imported into another database.
