<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Novice: Requires knowledge of the user interface on single-user computers.
<P>
This article summarizes the new query features and functionality in
Microsoft Access version 2.0. This information can also be found using the
Microsoft Access Help menu by searching for "What's New in Microsoft Access
Version 2.0."
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Rushmore Query Optimization</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft Access uses an optimization method similar to that used by
Microsoft FoxPro to speed up many types of queries.
<P>
<P><h3>Automatic Joins for Fields with the Same Name</h3>
 
<P>
Even if you have not defined relationships between tables, Microsoft Access
automatically creates joins between tables when a query is initially
created if the tables have matching fields with the same name and one of
the fields is a primary key.
<P>
<P><h3>Greater Updatability of Query Fields</h3>
 
<P>
When a query includes fields from more than one related table, you may be
able to update data on both sides of the join in the same query.
<P>
<P><h3>New Query Properties and Property Sheet</h3>
 
<P>
With the new query properties, you can add input masks and formats to your
queries, and you can limit the number of records displayed to a specified
value. Query properties can be set in the property sheet.
<P>
<P><h3>Query Datasheet Formatting</h3>
 
<P>
As with tables and forms, you can save your datasheet layout in queries.
For example, if you freeze a column in a query datasheet, you can save the
layout so it will appear the same way when you run the query again.
<P>
<P><h3>Subqueries</h3>
 
<P>
You can use SQL SELECT statements as subqueries within your expressions in
the Criteria row of the Query window.
<P>
<P><h3>Union and Data-Definition Queries</h3>
 
<P>
Using SQL in Microsoft Access, you can create union queries and queries
that create, change, or delete tables and indexes in Microsoft Access
databases. Use the SQL Specific command on the Query menu in a query's
Design view to create these types of queries.
<P>
<P><h3>Improved SQL View Window</h3>
 
<P>
You can enter any SQL statement in the improved SQL View window, including
statements that you cannot create in the query's QBE grid. The menu and the
toolbar buttons are also available when you are working in a SQL View
window.
<P>
<P><h3>SQL Pass-Through</h3>
 
<P>
You can pass SQL statements directly to SQL databases, providing improved
connectivity in client-server relationships. You can use SQL pass-through
queries as the source for a query, form, or report.
<P>
<P><h2>REFERENCES</h2>

then view each of the topics using the Microsoft Access Help menu.
