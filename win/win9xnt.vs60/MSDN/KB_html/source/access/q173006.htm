The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, you should first make a backup copy of the
registry files (System.dat and User.dat). Both are hidden files in the
Windows folder.
<P>
Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multiuser skills.
<P>
When you synchronize two replicas, you may receive the following error
message:
<P>
<PRE>   Synchronization between '&lt;Replica1.mdb&gt;' and '&lt;Replica2.mdb&gt;' failed.

   File sharing lock count exceeded (Error 3052).

</PRE>The error may also occur when you run a Visual Basic for Applications
procedure that uses the Synchronize method.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
A member of the replica set contains too many changes for synchronization
to be completed successfully. For example, if one of the replicas has
increased in size by 100 megabytes (MB) because you have added a large
number of new records, you may receive this error. The replica that
contains too many changes may be the database from which you are attempting
to synchronize, or it may also be another member of the replica set.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
If you are using Microsoft Access 97, you can take advantage of a new
feature that allows you to increase the MaxLocksPerFile setting for
Microsoft Jet database engine 3.5 by editing the Windows Registry. The
default value of this setting is 9500. However, changing this value is not
recommended if one of the replicas is located on a Novell Netware server
because the server's maximum record locks per connection is 10000. In
addition, changing this value will result in poor performance if one of the
replicas is located on a server running Windows NT version 3.51 or earlier.
If both replicas are located on servers running Microsoft Windows NT
version 4.0 or Microsoft Windows 95, the maximum value of this setting is
limited only by available resources.
<P>
WARNING: Modifications made to the system registry are considered advanced
usage of the Windows 95 or Windows NT operating systems. Extreme care
should be taken when making modifications. Any invalid or incorrect entries
may render the operating system unusable.
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall Windows 95. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved.
Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the Changing Keys And
Values Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Note that you should
make a backup copy of the registry files (System.dat and User.dat) before
you edit the registry.

<OL><P><LI>Quit Microsoft Access.

<P><LI>Click the Start button, and then click Run.

<P><LI>In the Open box, type "regedit" (without the quotation marks).

<P><LI>Locate the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE registry folder.

<P><LI>Expand the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE folder until you locate the folder
    SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Jet\3.5\Engines\Jet 3.5.

<P><LI>Double-click the Jet 3.5 folder to view its contents.

<P><LI>Select the MaxLocksPerFile entry; on the Edit menu, click Modify.

<P><LI>In the Edit DWORD Value dialog box, select Decimal and increase the
    number in the Value Data box.

<P><LI>Click OK to save the MaxLocksPerFile setting.

<P><LI>Quit the Registry Editor.

<P><LI>Start Microsoft Access and synchronize the replicas.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Access 97.
Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The MaxLocksPerFile setting allows the Microsoft Jet database engine to
complete large transactions without exceeding a specified record lock
limit. Instead of exceeding this limit, the Jet database engine splits a
transaction into two or more parts; after one part has been committed, the
Jet database engine frees the locks so that they can be reused. As a
result, fewer locks are required to complete the transaction. This prevents
a Novell Netware server, which limits the maximum record locks per
connection to 10000, from crashing when that value is exceeded.
<P>
However, the Jet database engine does not split the transaction when it
synchronizes two replicas. If the transaction cannot be completed within
the limit specified in the MaxLocksPerFile setting unless it is split into
parts, you receive the error described in the "Symptoms" section; the
synchronization does not occur.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 
<P>
WARNING: The following steps may require up to 400 MB free disk space. The
sample procedure fills a table with a large amount of data; running it may
take a long period of time, during which your CPU would be unavailable.

<OL><P><LI>Start Microsoft Access and open a new blank database.

<P><LI>Create the following table:
<P>
    Table: tblTable1
    ---------------------------
    Field Name: ID
       Data Type: Number
       Field Size: Long Integer
    Field Name: Field1
       Data Type: Text
       Field Size: 50
    Field Name: Field2
       Date Type: Text
       Field Size: 50
    Field Name: Field3
       Date Type: Text
       Field Size: 50
    Field Name: Field4
       Date Type: Text
       Field Size: 50

<P><LI>Save the table as tblTable1. When asked if you want to create a primary
    key, click No.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, point to Replication, and click Create Replica. When
    prompted to close the database, click Yes. When prompted to make a
    backup, click No.

<P><LI>In the Location Of New Replica dialog box, note the location and file
    name of the new replica. Click OK.

<P><LI>Click OK when prompted to reopen the database, which is now the Design
    Master.

<P><LI>Open a new, blank module and type the following procedure:
<P>
       Function Filler(lngNumRecs As Long)
<P>
<PRE>          Dim lngLoopCount As Long
          Dim strFillerString As String
          Dim db As Database
          Dim rs As Recordset

          strFillerString = ""
          For lngLoopCount = 1 To 40
             strFillerString = strFillerString &amp; "x"
          Next lngLoopCount
          Set db = CurrentDb
          Set rs = db.OpenRecordset("tblTable1")
          For lngLoopCount = 1 To lngNumRecs
             rs.AddNew
             rs![ID] = lngLoopCount
             rs![Field1] = strFillerString
             rs![Field2] = strFillerString
             rs![Field3] = strFillerString
             rs![Field4] = strFillerString
             rs.Update
          Next lngLoopCount
          db.Close
       End Function

</PRE><P><LI>Type the following line in the Debug window:
<P>
       ?Filler(500000)
<P>
    Note that this procedure could take a long time to run and may require
    as much as 400 MB of free disk space.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, point to Replication, and then click Synchronize
    Now.

<P><LI>In the Synchronize Database dialog box, click OK.
<P>
</OL>A progress indicator with the message "Synchronizing Replicas" appears, but
eventually you receive the error described in the "Symptoms" section.
