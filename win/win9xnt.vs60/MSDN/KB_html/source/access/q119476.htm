The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access versions 2.0, 7.0, 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Novice: Requires knowledge of the user interface on single-user computers.
<P>
When you print a mailing label report, Microsoft Access skips some of the
labels even though all of the records are printed.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior can occur if you set the CanGrow property of the report's
detail section and for all the controls in the detail section to Yes.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Set the CanGrow property for the detail section, or for one or more of the
controls in the detail section, to No.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If the CanGrow property is set to Yes for both the detail section and for
all the controls in the detail section, one or more of the labels may grow
on some pages. If a label grows, the detail section also grows, forcing
some labels to be printed on the next page.
<P>
