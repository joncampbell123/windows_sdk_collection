<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
You receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   ODBC - couldn't find ODBC.DLL

</PRE><h2>CAUSES</h2>
 
<P>
Here are three possible causes:

<UL><LI>The ODBC.DLL file you are using may be old.

<LI>You may have duplicate ODBC.DLL files on your system, and you are
   using the wrong one.

<LI>The ODBC.DLL file you are using may be damaged or corrupted.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
The ODBC.DLL file installed by Microsoft Access version 1.0 is dated
10-16-92, has a size of 44736 bytes, and should be installed in the
\WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
There are other situations that may indirectly cause this error message. To
troubleshoot for these possibilities:

<OL><P><LI>Use File Manager to search for multiple, corrupted, or outdated
   copies of these files:
<P>
<PRE>      File          Correct Dates and Sizes
      ---------------------------------------------------
      DBNMP3.DLL    dated 9-15-92(8241 bytes) or later
      SQLSRVR.DLL   dated 10-16-92(135792 bytes) or later
      NETAPI.DLL    depends on the network being used
      COMMDLG.DLL   dated 10-25-92(89248 bytes) or later

      NOTE: The sizes and dates referenced are correct if the files are
      installed by Microsoft Access version 1.0.

</PRE><P><LI>Make sure the files listed in step 1 are in their appropriate locations.
   All files except NETAPI.DLL are usually installed in the \WINDOWS\SYSTEM
   directory. The NETAPI.DLL file is a network specific driver; it is
   usually located in the network's program directory, which should be in
   the path.

<P><LI>Use another application, such as Q+E, SAF, or PowerBuilder, on the
   same machine to attempt to attach to the same data source. If you
   cannot access the data source from another application, you probably
   have a network problem with the NETAPI.DLL file or with the server, not
   with Microsoft Access or ODBC.

<P><LI>Attempt to attach another data source, if available, such as another
   SQL server. If you can attach to another server, the original server may
   be down, or you may need to reconfigure the entry for that server using
   the ODBC Administration Utility.

<P><LI>Attempt to attach the same data source from a different machine. If you
   cannot gain access to the SQL server from a different machine, you may
   have a network-wide problem, or the SQL server may be down or not
   communicating.

<P><LI>Try increasing your ODBC timeout settings in the ODBC section of the
   MSACCESS.INI file.

<P><LI>Check with the system administrator to see if the SQL server is up,
   available for transactions, and operating properly.

<P><LI>Reinstall ODBC after performing a clean boot and renaming the
   ODBC.DLL, DBNMP3.DLL, and SQLSRVR.DLL files.
