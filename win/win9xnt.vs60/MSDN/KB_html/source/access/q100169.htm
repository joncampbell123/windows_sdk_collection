<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Below is a synopsis of how the photos for the Photo field of the
Employees table in the Northwind Traders sample database NWIND.MDB
were prepared and processed.

<OL><P><LI>Photographs of the subjects were taken with a camera and developed
   as prints.

<P><LI>The prints were scanned on a color scanner connected to an
   Apple Macintosh.

<P><LI>The resulting files from the Macintosh (in .TIFF file format) were
   transferred to an IBM PC/AT compatible computer (to .BMP file format).

<P><LI>The images were converted from 256-color to 16-color (dithered) so
   that pictures would display correctly in 16-color mode, and also
   because 16-color images display faster than 256-color images.

<P><LI>The images were then added as embedded objects in the Employees
   table of the Northwind Traders database, following the instructions
   given in the Microsoft Access "User's Guide," Chapter 13, "Using
   Pictures, Graphs, and Other Objects," pages 314-339.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If you plan to use this process yourself, steps can be eliminated if
you use a scanner directly connected to an IBM PC/AT compatible
computer since the image transfer from the Macintosh (step 3) would not
be necessary and step 4 can often be handled by the scanner software.
<P>
Software helpful for processing graphic images:
<P>
<PRE> Apple Macintosh
 ---------------

 Adobe Photoshop

 IBM PC/AT Compatibles
 ---------------------

 PaintShop (Shareware--can be used for image file conversions.)
 WinGif (Shareware--can be used for image file conversions.)
 Microsoft Paintbrush (Great for touching up stray pixels.)
