The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access versions 1.0, 1.1, 2.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Novice: Requires knowledge of the user interface on single-user computers.
<P>
Microsoft Access has commands to create a raised or sunken effect for text
boxes and labels, but does not have commands to create these effects for
text. This article describes how to create raised and sunken text on a form
or report.
<P>
NOTE: In Microsoft Access for Windows 95 version 7.0, you can use a
Microsoft WordArt 2.0 Object to accomplish the same task. To do so, click
Object on the Insert menu, and then select Microsoft WordArt 2.0. This
gives you a wider choice of Special text effects for your labels.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This method for creating a raised or sunken effect uses three labels. The
three labels are stacked on one another. Two of the labels are slightly
offset from the other to create the shadow and highlight effects that are
necessary to create a raised or sunken appearance.
<P>
<P><h3>How to Create Raised Lettering</h3>
 
<P>
The following steps describe how to create lettering with a raised
appearance:

<OL><P><LI>Start Microsoft Access and create a new, blank form.

<P><LI>Change the form's color to light gray. To do so, open the palette
    by choosing Palette from the View menu. Then, click an empty area
    of the form and select the light gray box in the Palette's Fill row
    in version 1.x, or the BackColor row in version 2.0.

<P><LI>Add a new label to the form and enter the text "Test" (without
    the quotation marks).

<P><LI>Select the Clear box in the Palette's Fill row in version 1.x, or the
    BackColor row in version 2.0, so that the two other labels (created
    later) can be seen.

<P><LI>Set the label's FontSize property to 28 and its FontName property
    to Times New Roman (this is optional, and can be changed to any
    font size and name you want). Resize the control to fit the text if
    necessary.

<P><LI>Change the label's ControlName property to Main.

<P><LI>Note the Top and Left properties for the label. You will need to
    use these settings later when you create the two other labels.

<P><LI>Select the label and make a copy of it by choosing Duplicate from the
    Edit menu.

<P><LI>Change the duplicate label's ControlName property to Left.

<P><LI>Change the new label's Top and Left properties to be .07 greater than
    the Top and Left properties of the Main label. For example, if the Main
    label's Top property is set to .5, set the Left label's Top property
    to .57

<P><LI>Change the Left label's text color in version 1.x, or Forecolor in
    version 2.0, to white using the palette.

<P><LI>From the Layout menu in version 1.x, or the Format menu in version 2.0,
    choose Send To Back.

<P><LI>Select the Main label, and then choose Duplicate from the Edit menu.

<P><LI>Change the new label's ControlName property to Right. Set its Top
    and Left properties to be .01 greater than those of the Main label.

<P><LI>Change the Right label's text color in version 1.x, or Forecolor in
    version 2.0, to dark gray using the palette.

<P><LI>From the Layout menu in version 1.x, or the Format menu in version 2.0,
    choose Send To Back.

<P><LI>Select the Main label and change its text color (or Forecolor) to light
    gray using the palette.

<P><LI>View the form in Form view. Note that the text "Test" appears as raised
    text.
<P>
</OL><h3>How to Create Sunken Lettering</h3>
 
<P>
To create sunken lettering, follow steps 1-18 above, but reverse the text
colors of the Left and Right labels in steps 11 and 15. Set the Left
label's text color to dark gray in step 11, and set the Right label's text
color to white in step 15.
<P>
Note that you can also create a raised or sunken effect for the entire
label by choosing Raised or Sunken from the Palette's Appearance row.
