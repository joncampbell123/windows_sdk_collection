The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access versions 2.0, 7.0, 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
If you choose a unique field when you link to a dBASE table, the index
only contains records that are unique with respect to the given index
expression. For example, a .dbf file may contain "n" records, while the
unique index may contain "m" entries, where "n" does not equal "m." This
means that when the database is viewed by a UNIQUE index, it may appear to
have fewer records then it actually does.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
There is no concept of primary indexes in dBASE. All indexes are taken as
secondary indexes. The dBASE command SET UNIQUE ON only limits which
records are displayed.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
One way to prevent this scenario is to SET UNIQUE OFF and REINDEX in dBASE.
This will allow all records to be displayed. Another solution is not to
choose a unique field when you link the dBASE table. A third solution is to
edit manually the INF file that is created when you link a dBASE table.
Following are examples of the INF file.
<P>
Contains Unique Field:
<P>
<PRE>   [dBASE III]
   NDX1=C:\ACCESS\SAMPLES\city.ndx
   [UIDX1 city#idx]
   NDX1=C:\ACCESS\SAMPLES\city.ndx

</PRE>Without Unique Field:
<P>
<PRE>   [dBASE III]
   NDX1=C:\ACCESS\SAMPLES\city.ndx

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following example helps to illustrate the concept.
<P>
A dBASE file contains the following records:
<P>
<PRE>   Company Name        Address        Phone
   ------------------------------------------------
   ABC                 123 4th ST.    (888)888-8888
   ABC                 123 4th St.    (999)999-9999
   CDF                 1st S.         (777)777-7777

</PRE>The index is created on the Company Name field. If the Unique setting is
on in dBASE, then only 2 records would be displayed (the 1st and 3rd).
<P>
The field that is designated as unique allows you to enter duplicate
information. However, when you query the file, the duplicate information
does not show.
