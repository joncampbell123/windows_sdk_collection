Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multiuser skills.
<P>
When you import or attach Btrieve files, you may receive the following
error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Couldn't find object &lt;tablename&gt;

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 

<OL><P><LI>Microsoft Access requires all three Xtrieve data dictionary files

<P><LI>Check the descriptive Btrieve table name to see if it begins with
   any of the following SQL keywords: SELECT, INSERT, IN, UPDATE,
   ALTER, TRANSFORM, DELETE, CREATE, DROP, PROCEDURES, or PARAMETERS.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Cause 1</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft Access requires all three Xtrieve data dictionary files
(FILE.DDF, INDEX.DDF, and FIELDS.DDF) to be able to import or attach
Btrieve files.
<P>
FILE.DDF contains the MS-DOS file name of each data table in the
dictionary. These file names can be in any of the following valid
MS-DOS formats:

<UL><LI>File Only (for example, MYDATA.DAT)

<LI>Relative Path (for example, ..\DEV\TEST\MYDATA.DAT)

<LI>Fully qualified (for example, C:\TOOLS\DEV\TEST\MYDATA.DAT)

<LI>Universal Naming Convention (UNC) (for example,
   (\\MYSERVER\USERS\JOE\TOOLS\DEV\TEST\MYDATA.DAT)
<P>
</UL>When you are importing or attaching a Btrieve file, Microsoft Access
retrieves the MS-DOS filename from FILE.DDF and attempts to open the file.
If the file does not exist in the location specified, you will see this
error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Couldn't find object

</PRE></OL>In the case of the File Only and Relative Path formats, the ability to
open the file depends on the accuracy of the current directory. For
example, in the File Only format, MYDATA.DAT must exist in the current
directory. In the Relative Path format, MYDATA.DAT must exist in the
..\DEV\TEST directory, which in turn must exist relative to the current
directory.
<P>
Exactly which directory is the current directory is complicated by the
fact that Windows-based applications all share the same environment and
the same current directory. For example, if you change the current
directory in Microsoft Excel by choosing Open from the File menu and
changing directories to open a file, you also change the current directory
for Microsoft Access.
<P>
Therefore, to fix the problem, you need to find out what path statements
are included in FILE.DDF. You can do this by opening FILE.DDF in Microsoft
Write, the word processor provided with Windows. When Microsoft Write asks
if you want to convert this file to Microsoft Write format, choose No
Conversion.
<P>
WARNING: Do not save the file after you finish viewing it with Microsoft
Write. If you do, you will corrupt FILE.DDF beyond repair.
<P>
After opening FILE.DDF in Microsoft Write, you will see several characters
that look like a box. Scroll to the end of the file. There you will see
the MS-DOS file names of the Btrieve data files. The extension is usually
.DAT, but it does not have to be. After you have noted the names and paths,
close FILE.DDF taking care NOT to save the changes.
<P>
Now that you have the file names, here are two things you can do to fix
the problem:

<OL><P><LI>Move the files into the correct location(s). This is the easiest
   method and the one Microsoft recommends.

<P><LI>Use Btrieve or a third-party tool to modify the FILE.DDF file so
   that the paths are correct. This method is much more complicated.
   Microsoft recommends you do not attempt them unless you are a
   Btrieve expert.
<P>
</OL><h3>Cause 2</h3>
 
<P>
When you first attach a Btrieve table, Microsoft Access displays the
descriptive table name, which is different than the DOS filename for the
Btrieve table. For example, "IN Product File" is the descriptive name
while INPRODUC.DAT is the DOS filename.
<P>
Microsoft Access reads in the descriptive name during the initial
attachment and checks the name to see if it is a SQL keyword. If it is,
Microsoft Access will return the above error message.
<P>
Therefore, to fix the problem, you will need to modify the descriptive
name to change it to another name that does not conflict with any of the
SQL keywords listed above. Using the above example, change the descriptive
name from "IN Product File" to "IN_Product File."
<P>
You will need to use Btrieve or a third-party tool to modify the FILE.DDF
file to change the descriptive name. This method is complicated and
Microsoft recommends you do not attempt this unless you are a Btrieve
expert.
