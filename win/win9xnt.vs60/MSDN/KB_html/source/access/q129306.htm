The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access version 2.0
<LI>Microsoft Office for Windows version 4.3
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
When you attempt to use a Microsoft Access Wizard, such as the Form Wizard
or the Report Wizard, on Gateway 2000 and P590 computers that have
Microsoft Office for Windows version 4.3 pre-installed, you may receive a
general protection (GP) fault.
<P>
The pre-installation process that Gateway uses seems to cause a problem
with the DAO2016.DLL file. In some cases, the problem can extend to other
shared dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) as well. Gateway has been notified of
the problem.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The GP fault may be caused by a faulty Microsoft Access DLL file called
DAO2016.DLL.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
In most cases, replacing the DAO2016.DLL file corrects the problem.
<P>
Instructions about how to replace the DAO2016.DLL file (and other files if
necessary) are detailed below. We recommend that you manually replace the
files rather than use the uninstall feature of the Microsoft Access Setup
program. Using the uninstall feature can have adverse consequences on an
existing installation, such as:

<UL><LI>Overwriting an existing SYSTEM.MDA file.

<LI>Losing special icon properties.

<LI>Overwriting the MSACC20.INI file settings.
<P>
</UL>You should first attempt to replace the DAO2016.DLL file because it is the
most common cause of the problem. If this does not work, replace the other
files listed below.
<P>
To replace the faulty files, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Quit Microsoft Access if it is running.

<P><LI>Use the following steps to replace the files:
<P>
<P><PRE>    a. If you have a CD-ROM, remove the DLL files and re-install Microsoft
       Access. Because they may be overwritten, save any files (such as the
       SYSTEM.MDA or the MSACC20.INI file, or any databases you have
       created) that you want to retain.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       If you want to expand the DLL file from the CD-ROM, you must use the
       Microsoft extract utility, EXTRACT.EXE, which you can find on the
       first Microsoft Access Disk Image. For further information about
       this type of extraction, search on the words "CAB" and "Extract"
       here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    b. If you have disks, run the Microsoft file decompression utility,
       DECOMP.EXE. You can find this file on Disk 1 of the original
       Microsoft Access disks. Run the DECOMP.EXE file with the following
       parameter:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>         DECOMP -f

       The -f parameter forces a new file to replace the old file.

       When you are prompted "Enter the name and/or path for the compressed
       file:," insert Disk 2 of the original Microsoft Access disks, and
       then enter the name and path of the compressed DAO2016.DLL file.

       NOTE: Files compressed with the DECOMP.EXE file end with an
       underscore (_). For instance, enter:

         a:\dao2016.dl_

       When you are prompted "Enter the name and/or path for the
       decompressed file:," enter the name and/or path of your
       Windows\SYSTEM directory and the file name. For instance,
       enter:

         c:\windows\system\dao2016.dll

       NOTE: If you entered the correct name and/or path, you receive the
       message:

         Wrote 437408 bytes to output file
         'C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\DAO2016.DLL'

</PRE><P><LI>Start Microsoft Access. If you receive a GP fault again, backup any
   files (such as the SYSTEM.MDA or the MSACC20.INI file, or any databases
   you have created) that you want to retain. Run the Microsoft Access
   Setup program with the Remove All option and reinstall Microsoft
   Access.

<P><LI>Restart Microsoft Access. If you receive a GP fault again, you may have
   faulty source disks or a bad CD-ROM.
