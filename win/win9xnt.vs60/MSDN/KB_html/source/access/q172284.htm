The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access versions 7.0, 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Novice: Requires knowledge of the user interface on single-user computers.
<P>
When you apply a filter or sort to a form and then click Remove Filter/Sort
on the Records menu, it appears that the filter or sort has been removed.
However, if you check the Filter property and OrderBy property in a Visual
Basic for Applications procedure or in the form's property sheet, you see
that these properties contain the values that were in effect before you
removed the filter or sort.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Apply Filter/Sort and Remove Filter/Sort commands on the Records menu
change only the values of the FilterOn and OrderByOn properties. These
commands do not affect the values of the forms's Filter or OrderBy
properties. Selecting Remove Filter/Sort on the Records menu simply sets
FilterOn and OrderbyOn to False. As a result, the form displays all of the
records, because, although the filter or sort is still present, it is no
longer in effect.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
There are two methods for completely removing a filter or sort from a form.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1</h3>
 
<P>
Use the form's property sheet to remove the filter or sort. To do so,
follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Open the form in Design view.

<P><LI>On the Edit menu, click Select Form.

<P><LI>On the View menu, click Properties and select the Data tab.

<P><LI>Delete the contents of the Filter box or the OrderBy box.
<P>
</OL><h3>Method 2</h3>
 
<P>
Use a macro or a Visual Basic for Applications procedure to remove a
filter or sort. In the following example, the filter and sort are removed
during the Current event of the form.
<P>
<PRE>   Private Sub Form_Current()
      If Me.FilterOn = False Then
         Me.Filter = ""
         Me.OrderBy = ""
      End If
   End Sub

</PRE></OL>Note that if you use this event procedure to remove a filter, the only way
to activate the filter again is to recreate it. On the Records menu, point
to Filter and click the appropriate command to recreate the filter.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start Microsoft Access and open the sample database Northwind.mdb.

<P><LI>Open the Customers form in Design view, and add a command button to
   the form. Set its properties as follows:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Name: btnShowFilter
      Caption: Show Filter
</PRE>
<P><LI>Set the OnClick property of the command button to the following event
   procedure:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Private Sub btnShowFilter_Click()
</PRE><P>
<PRE>         MsgBox Me.Filter

      End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>On the View menu, click Form View.

<P><LI>Select the contents of the Country field, which should be "Germany."

<P><LI>On the Records menu, point to Filter and click Filter by Selection.
   Note that only the records of customers located in Germany are
   displayed. The text to the right of the navigation buttons also
   indicates that the records have been filtered.

<P><LI>Click Show Filter and note that the value of the Filter property is
<P>
<P><PRE>      ((Customers.Country = "Germany"))
</PRE>
<P><LI>On the Records menu, click Remove Filter/Sort. Note that the records of
   all customers are now displayed.

<P><LI>Click Show Filter and note that the value of the Filter property is
   still as follows:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ((Customers.Country = "Germany"))
</PRE><P>
