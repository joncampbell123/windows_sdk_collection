<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
To perform a Do While or Do Until loop in a Microsoft Access macro, you
need to use a combination of correct macro structure and the RunMacro
action with appropriate information supplied in the Repeat Expression
parameter. These requirements are described in more detail later in this
article.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
There are several types of Do loops. Each type handles the looping
procedure and conditions differently. The different types of Do loops
are as follows:

<OL><P><LI>Do While &lt;condition&gt;... Loop
<P>
   This loop will execute while the condition is true. If the loop is
   encountered and the condition is already false, the loop will not
   be performed.

<P><LI>Do Until &lt;condition&gt;... Loop
<P>
   This loop will execute until the condition is true. If the loop is
   encountered and the condition is already true, the loop will not be
   performed.

<P><LI>Do... Loop While &lt;condition&gt;
<P>
   This loop will execute the first time unconditionally, and then loop
   while the condition is true. If the loop is encountered and the
   condition is already false, the loop will be performed once.

<P><LI>Do... Loop Until &lt;condition&gt;
<P>
   This loop will execute the first time unconditionally, and then loop
   until the condition is true. If the loop is encountered and the
   condition is already true, the loop will be performed once.
<P>
</OL>To perform a Do While or Do Until loop in a macro, use a macro similar to
the following examples. To create the following examples, open a new macro
and click Macro Names on the View menu. Add the following macro names and
actions and save this macro group as Do_Loops.
<P>
<P><h3>Do While &lt;Condition&gt;... Loop and Do Until &lt;Condition&gt;... Loop</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   Macro Name       Action
   -------------------------
   Do_Loop1         RunMacro
   Loop1            MsgBox

   Do_Loop1 Actions
   --------------------------------------
   RunMacro
      Macro Name: Do_Loops.Loop1
      Repeat Expression: &lt;your_condition&gt;

   Loop1 Actions
   -------------------
   MsgBox
      Message: ="Loop"

</PRE></OL>In this example, the Do_Loop1 macro calls the Loop1 macro while the
Repeat Expression parameter of the RunMacro action is true.
<P>
<P><h3>Do... Loop While &lt;Condition&gt; and Do... Loop Until &lt;Condition&gt;</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   Macro Name       Action
   -------------------------
   Do_Loop1         RunMacro
                    RunMacro
   Loop1            MsgBox

   Do_Loop1 Actions
   --------------------------------------
   RunMacro
      Macro Name: Do_Loops.Loop1
   RunMacro
      Macro Name: Do_Loops.Loop1
      Repeat Expression: &lt;your_condition&gt;

   Loop1 Actions
   -------------------
   MsgBox
      Message: ="Loop"

</PRE>In this example, the Do_Loop1 macro calls the Loop1 macro once
unconditionally, and then continues to call the Loop1 macro while the
Repeat Expression parameter of the RunMacro action is True.
<P>
<P><h3>Conditions</h3>
 
<P>
The condition used in the loop, which is supplied in the Repeat Expression
parameter of the RunMacro action, can be based on a value in a field on a
form, a property of a control on a form, or the value returned from a
Visual Basic or Access Basic function. If the condition is based on a
field in a form or a property of a control on a form, it will have syntax
similar to:
<P>
<PRE>   Forms![CounterForm]![Counter]&lt;=10

   -or-

   Forms![EntryForm]![InvoiceNo].Visible=True

</PRE>If the condition is based on the value returned from a Visual Basic or
Access Basic function, it will have syntax similar to:
<P>
<PRE>   Time()&gt;=TimeEntry()

</PRE><h3>Do While Loops vs. Do Until Loops</h3>
 
<P>
Whether a loop is a Do While loop or a Do Until loop depends on the
condition. The RunMacro action runs the macro until the condition in the
Repeat Expression parameter is false. This behavior is exactly what is
needed for a Do While loop. It is, however, the opposite of what is needed
for a Do Until loop. Therefore, to make a condition for a Do Until loop
work correctly, precede the condition in the RunMacro action with the NOT
operator.
