The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access versions 1.0, 1.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you choose one of the alphabet filter buttons in the Suppliers form
in the sample database NWIND.MDB, the suppliers in the underlying records
are filtered correctly. However, the list of suppliers in the Select
Company To Find box is not filtered, and still displays all the
suppliers.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The alphabet filter buttons are not meant to filter the entries in the
Select Company To Find combo box when the underlying record set is
filtered.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
The following steps describe how to modify the Suppliers form so that the
alphabet filter buttons will filter the list in the Select Company To
Find combo box:

<OL><P><LI>View the Suppliers form in Design view. Place an unbound text box
   with the following properties anywhere on the form:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ControlName: Company Pick List Filter
      Visible: No
      Default Value: *
</PRE>
<P><LI>Open the Alpha Filter Buttons macro in Design view. Add the following
   macro actions at the end of EACH ApplyFilter action:
<P>
<P><PRE>      SetValue
<PRE></PRE>         Item: [Company Pick List Filter]
         Expression: "[Aaaa]*"

      Requery
         ControlName: Company Pick List

      SetValue
         Item: [Company Pick List]
         Expression: [Company Name]

   The expression in the first SetValue action in each entry should be
   copied from the Where Condition argument of each ApplyFilter section.
   For example, for the A button the ApplyFilter Where Condition argument
   is "[AAAAA]*" (these characters are actually international versions of
   A, represented by A so they will appear on all computer displays).
   The B button's Where Condition argument is "B*," and so on.

</PRE><P><LI>After the ShowAllRecords action, add the following actions:
<P>
<P><PRE>      SetValue
<PRE></PRE>         Item: [Company Pick List Filter]
         Expression: "*"

      Requery
         ControlName: Company Pick List

      SetValue
         Item: [Company Pick List]
         Expression: [Company Name]

</PRE><P><LI>Open the Supplier List query in Design view and add the following
   criteria to the Criteria row of the Company Name column:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Like [Forms]![Suppliers]![Company Pick List Filter] &amp; "*"
</PRE><P>
</OL><h3>How the Company Pick List Filter Works</h3>
 
<P>
After the ApplyFilter action filters the underlying records, the SetValue
action places the criteria in the hidden text box control on the
Suppliers form.
<P>
The Requery action forces the Select Company To Find combo box to refresh
its list, forcing the Supplier List query to rerun. The query then runs
using the hidden text box contents as the criteria for filtering the
company names to appear in the list.
<P>
The final SetValue action ensures that a valid company name from the
filtered list appears in the combo box.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Open the Suppliers form in Form view.

<P><LI>Choose the B alphabet filter button at the bottom of the form to
   filter for company names that start with the letter B.

<P><LI>Click the drop-down arrow on the Select Company To Find combo box.
   Note that all suppliers, not just those with a company name that
   starts with the letter B, are listed.
