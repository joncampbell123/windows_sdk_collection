The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access version 2.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multiuser skills.
<P>
You can use Access Basic code to determine to which groups a user belongs,
but only members of the Admins group can view this information. For
example, running the following sample function will return the current
user's name and a list of the groups to which the current user belongs:
<P>
<PRE>   Function GetGroups ()
   Dim W As WorkSpace, US As String, U As User, i As Integer, j As Integer

      Set W = DBEngine.Workspaces(0)
      US = CurrentUser()
      Set U = W.Users(US)

      Debug.Print U.Name
      For j = 0 To U.Groups.Count - 1
         Debug.Print "   " &amp; U(j).Name
      Next
   End Function

</PRE>If the current user is not a member of the Admins group, the following
error message will be generated:
<P>
<PRE>   Record(s) can't be read; no Read Data permissions on 'MSysGroups'

</PRE><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this behavior, you must log in to a new workspace as a
member of the Admins group and pass the name of the user whose groups you
want to list. The following sample function demonstrates this method:
<P>
<PRE>   Function GetGroups2 ()
      Dim W As WorkSpace, US As String, U As User, i As Integer

      Set W = DBEngine.CreateWorkspace("NewWS", "MyAdmin", "MyPassword")
      US = CurrentUser()
      Set U = W.users(US)

      Debug.Print U.Name
      For i = 0 To U.Groups.Count - 1
         Debug.Print "   " &amp; U(i).Name
      Next
   End Function

</PRE>NOTE: This function assumes the existence of a user named MyAdmin who is a
member of the Admins group in the current system database with an account
password of MyPassword.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior no longer occurs in Microsoft Access version 7.0.
