The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access versions 1.0, 1.1, 2.0, 7.0, 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
You receive a "Segment Load Failure" error message or another memory-
conflict error message.
<P>
In Microsoft Access 97, you may also receive a "System Process - Lost
Delayed Write Error" or an Invalid Bookmark Error message when viewing
data from linked tables.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
A "Segment Load Failure" error message can occur if Microsoft Access is
running on a network or is accessing data on a network, and the network
server stops functioning correctly.
<P>
A segment load failure implies that there was a problem moving information
from secondary storage, such as a network server disk, to main memory. If a
network server stops functioning correctly, expected information may not be
available to Microsoft Access.
<P>
A "System Process - Lost Delayed Write Error" error message implies that
Microsoft Access had a problem writing data from its buffers to secondary
storage. This can occur if the connection to a Network share stops
functioning correctly. An "Invalid bookmark" error message will also occur
numerous times for each field on each record in the current table or query
that you are viewing if the share on which your data is stored becomes
unavailable.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
The following suggestions may help you to diagnose the problem:

<UL><LI>Make a backup of all critical data and run disk diagnostic software,
   such as the MS-DOS CHKDSK command, to check the integrity of the
   workstation and server disk drives.

<LI>If the workstation has a complete Microsoft Access installation, quit
   and then restart Microsoft Access on the workstation, and see if it
   operates correctly without using the network for any services. If the
   problem continues with Microsoft Access operating in isolation, begin
   checking the workstation for memory conflicts.

<LI>If the database is being accessed off a network server, consider
   copying it to the local workstation to isolate whether the problem
   is workstation or server specific.

<LI>If the server is required, just start the server and the Microsoft
   Access workstation to test Microsoft Access. If the problem does not
   occur at this point, you can start and diagnose other workstations one
   by one.
