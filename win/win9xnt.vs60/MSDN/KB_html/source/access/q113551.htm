<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multiuser skills.
<P>
This article describes several tips for improving performance when you are
accessing data from an ODBC data source.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Try these tips to improve performance with ODBC data sources:

<UL><LI>Restrict the amount of data that you request from the server. Do
   not ask for more data than you need. Use queries to select only
   the fields and rows that you need.

<LI>Use only the functionality you need. Snapshots are less powerful than
   dynasets and are not updateable, but may be faster, particularly for
   small recordsets without Memo or OLE Object fields.

<LI>Use attached tables to access server data. Do not use "direct" server
   access (that is, opening remote databases and executing queries against
   them). Instead, attach tables and use the attachments, or use pass-
   through queries.

<LI>Use list and combo boxes wisely. On a form, each list box, combo box,
   subform, and control containing a total requires a separate query.
   Against local data, performance may be adequate. Against remote data,
   however, long delays may occur when you open a form since each query
   must be sent to the server and a response returned before the form can
   open.

<LI>Avoid large combo boxes. Including a combo box with hundreds, or even
   thousands, of choices based on a local table may yield acceptable
   response time, especially if you define an appropriate index on the
   local table. Against a remote table, however, such a combo box will
   yield sluggish performance as it drains server and network resources as
   it fetches data to fill the list. It is best to limit the number of rows
   returned to the combo box when you are working with remote data. You can
   also break up the data into smaller combo boxes (bearing the tip above
   in mind).

<LI>Use the Find command only on smaller recordsets. The Microsoft Jet
   database engine optimizes the Find command to work well against local
   recordsets of almost any size, and against remote recordsets of
   reasonable size. However, when you are working with large remote
   recordsets (thousands of records or more), you should instead use a
   filter or query and be careful to use restrictions that your server can
   process.

<LI>Make sure that queries are sent to the server for processing. The most
   important factor in query performance against remote data is ensuring
   that your server executes as much of the query as possible. The
   Microsoft Jet database engine attempts to send the entire query to your
   server, but evaluates locally any query clauses and expressions that are
   not generally supported by servers or by your particular server.
   Functionality not supported by servers in general includes:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Operations that cannot be expressed in a single SQL statement. This
      can occur when you use a query as an input to another query, or when
      your query's FROM clause contains a Totals query or DISTINCT query.
      Often, you can rearrange your queries to calculate totals after all
      other operations.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - Operations that are Microsoft Jet database engine-specific extensions
      to SQL, such as crosstab queries, TOP queries, and reports with
      multiple levels of grouping and totals. Note that simple crosstab
      queries can be sent to servers.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - Expressions that contain Microsoft Access-specific operators or
      functions. The Microsoft Access financial functions and statistical
      aggregates have no server equivalents.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - User-defined Access Basic functions that take remote columns as
      arguments. These functions do not exist on the server, but must
      process remote column data. However, if a user-defined function
      returns a single value and does not reference a remote column, the
      function is evaluated locally and its value is sent to the server
      for processing.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - Mixing text and numeric data types in operators or UNION query
      outputs. Most servers lack the data-type leniency in Microsoft
      Access. Because of this, use explicit conversion functions where
      appropriate.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - Heterogeneous joins between local tables and remote tables, or
      between remote tables in different ODBC data sources. Joins between
      small local tables and large remote tables, where the join column is
      indexed, may result in a remote index join. In a remote index join,
      one query for each row in the local table is sent to the server and
      only the joining rows are returned.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - Non-remotable expressions, or expressions that cannot be sent
      remotely, because they cannot be evaluated by your server. Non-
      remoteable output expressions (those in the SELECT clause) do not
      force local evaluation of your query unless they occur in a Totals
      query, a DISTINCT query, or a UNION query. Non-remoteable expressions
      in other clauses (WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY, HAVING, and so on) force
      at least part of your query to be evaluated locally.
</PRE>
<LI>Servers differ in some areas of supported functionality. When you attach
   a remote table, the Microsoft Jet database engine queries the ODBC
   driver for its capabilities. If the required functionality is supported
   by the driver and the server, the Microsoft Jet database engine sends
   the operation to the server for processing. If not, the Microsoft Jet
   database engine performs the operation locally. Areas of differing
   support include (but are not limited to) the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Outer joins. Note that the Microsoft Jet database engine does not
      send multiple outer joins to a server, although many inner joins may
      accompany a single outer join.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - Numeric, string, and date/time functions (such as Log(), Mid$(),
      DatePart(), and so on).
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - Conversion functions (such as CInt(), CStr(), CVDate(), and so on).
