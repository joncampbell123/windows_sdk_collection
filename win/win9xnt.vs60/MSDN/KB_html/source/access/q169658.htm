The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
When you run the Microsoft Access 97 Setup program from an administrative
installation on a server, you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Setup Error 914
   Object 27
   Your Setup files may be damaged. Try restarting the Setup program from
   where you originally ran it.

</PRE>You may also receive error messages regarding Objects 1932, 1933, 1934 and
3314. Finally, you receive the error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft Access 97 Setup was not completed successfully.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Access 97 Setup is using a setup table (.stf) file that was
opened, edited, and saved improperly in Microsoft Excel. The resulting
corruption in the setup table can occur regardless of which version of
Microsoft Excel you use to edit the file.
<P>
Also, if you open a custom .stf file in Microsoft Excel, make changes to it
and save it, you may receive these error messages when you use the custom
.stf file with Microsoft Access 97 Setup.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To prevent corruption of the setup table, you must perform extra steps
immediately after opening the .stf file and prior to making any other
changes to it.

<OL><P><LI>Open the .stf file. You can open the .stf file by following the steps
   in the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../setup/q111248.htm">Q111248</A></B>
<PRE></PRE>      TITLE     : XL: Opening/Saving STF File in Excel May Cause Setup
                  Errors

</PRE><P><LI>After the .stf file is open, press CTRL+SHIFT+SPACEBAR to select the
   entire .stf file. Then, on the Data menu, point to Filter, and click
   AutoFilter.

<P><LI>In cell E1, click the arrow, and then click the value "AddRegData."

<P><LI>In cell F1, click the arrow and click Custom. In the Custom AutoFilter
   dialog box, set the following values
<P>
<P><PRE>      Show rows where: F contains """" (four quotation marks)
</PRE><P>
   and click OK.

<P><LI>Select all visible cells in column F. On the Edit menu, click Replace.
   In the Find What box, type a single space followed by a quotation mark
   ( "). In the Replace With box, type a quotation mark ("). Click Replace
   All.

<P><LI>Select all visible cells in column F. On the Edit menu, click Replace.
   In the Find What box, type three quotation marks ("""). In the Replace
   With box, type two quotation marks (""). Click Replace All.

<P><LI>Select all visible cells in column F. On the Edit menu, click Replace.
   In the Find What box, type two quotation marks (""). In the Replace
   With box, type a quotation mark ("). Click Replace All.

<P><LI>On the Data menu, point to Filter, and click AutoFilter. Locate ObjID 27
   in column A.

<P><LI>Go to column G. Remove the leading space and the quotation marks
   surrounding the data in this cell.
<P>
</OL>You can now make changes to the .stf file. When you are finished, use the
instructions shown in the Microsoft Knowledge Base article mentioned in
step 1 and save the .stf file as a tab-delimited text file.
<P>
If you have already made changes to your .stf file and are receiving the
error messages shown in the "Symptoms" section, you can repair your .stf
file by following the steps in the "Workaround" section.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you open an .stf in Microsoft Excel, the Text Import Wizard helps you
convert the file (a very large text file) into a format that Microsoft
Excel can display.
<P>
The steps used to open an .stf in earlier versions of Microsoft Access
must be altered slightly to work correctly with the setup table files for
Microsoft Access 97. Because of this, using the incorrect steps to open,
edit, and save the setup table file will result in a corrupted setup table
file, and you will receive the error messages shown in the "Symptoms"
section when you run Microsoft Access 97 Setup.
