The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access versions 1.0, 1.1, 2.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11
<LI>Microsoft SQL Server version 4.2 for OS/2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multiuser skills.
<P>
You are unable to communicate with SQL Server in Microsoft Access when you
are running Microsoft Access under Microsoft Windows for Workgroups on a
Novell NetWare network.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Windows for Workgroups IPX/SPX driver (MSIPX.COM) does not work
correctly with Novell's named pipe requester (DOSNP.EXE) to connect to or
communicate with SQL through named pipes.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Use the NetWare Integration Kit (NIK), which provides native SPX/IPX
connectivity to SQL Server. This connectivity eliminates the need for
DOSNP.EXE. The NIK enables Microsoft Access and Windows for Workgroups to
communicate correctly with SQL Server on a Novell network.
<P>
You can obtain the NIK by purchasing SQL Server for OS/2 version 4.2B or
the upgrade kit from the usual retail channels.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows for
Workgroups version 3.11. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Novell's implementation of IPX is a file called IPX.COM. Microsoft's
equivalent NDIS-compliant implementation of IPX is a file called
MSIPX.COM, which is used by Microsoft Windows for Workgroups. MSIPX.COM is
functionally equivalent to Novell's IPX.COM, but has the additional
capability of using NDIS-compliant network adapter drivers.
<P>
When you install the NetWare Named Pipe Requester, a terminate-and-stay-
resident program (TSR) called DOSNP.EXE installs in memory. This TSR works
with IPX.COM to provide named-pipe functionality (which is the
communication protocol used by SQL Server) to applications. However,
DOSNP.EXE does not work correctly with MSIPX.COM at this time. Because
Windows for Workgroups uses MSIPX.COM, the NetWare Named Pipe Requester
does not work with Windows for Workgroups. Therefore, Microsoft Access is
not able to properly communicate with SQL Server.

and Windows for Workgroups clients, please see the following article
