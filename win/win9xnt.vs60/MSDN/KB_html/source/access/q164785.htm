The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multiuser skills.
<P>
After you try to synchronize with a replica that has been deleted, you
receive one of the following error messages:
<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft Access can't open the database '&lt;Database Name&gt;'.

   '&lt;Database Name&gt;' isn't a valid path. Make sure that the path name is
   spelled correctly and that you are connected to the server on which the
   file resides.

   -or-

   Microsoft Access can't open the database '&lt;Database Name&gt;'.

   Couldn't find file '&lt;Database Name&gt;'.

</PRE>This is followed by another message:
<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft Access has deleted '&lt;Database Name&gt;' and removed it from the
   replica set.

   This change isn't reflected until the database is closed and reopened.

   Do you want Microsoft Access to close and reopen the database now?

</PRE>However, when you click Yes to close and reopen the database, nothing
happens.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Access 97 cannot automatically close and reopen the database
because the Synchronize Database dialog box is still open.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Click Cancel in the Synchronize Database dialog box, and then manually
close and reopen the database.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, point to Replication, and then click Create
   Replica.

<P><LI>Click Yes in the message box that states the database must be closed
   before you can create a replica.

   your database.

<P><LI>In the "Location of New Replica" dialog box, select a folder and file
   name for the new replica, and then click OK.

<P><LI>Delete the new replica database using Windows Explorer or File
   Manager.
