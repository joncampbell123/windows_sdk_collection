The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access versions 1.0, 1.1, 2.0, 7.0, 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Novice: Requires knowledge of the user interface on single-user computers.
<P>
When you try to open a table in Design view, you may receive the following
error message, depending on your version of Microsoft Access.
<P>
<PRE>   In Microsoft Access 97 and Microsoft Access version 7.0:

      You can't open the table &lt;table name&gt; for modification.

   In Microsoft Access version 2.0:

      Can't switch to Datasheet view and can't return to Design view.

   In Microsoft Access version 1.x:

      Unable to recover from attempt to switch view. Window
      will be closed.

</PRE>Microsoft Access then returns focus to the Database window.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This error message occurs only in rare situations. It is an informational
message only, not a program error.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior in Microsoft Access 7.0 and 97</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Two users (User A and User B) both open the sample database
   Northwind.mdb, non-exclusively.

<P><LI>Both users open the Categories table in Datasheet view.

<P><LI>Both users simultaneously switch to Design view. User A succeeds, but
   User B receives the following error message:
<P>
<P><PRE>      You can't open the table &lt;table name&gt; for modification.
</PRE>
<P><LI>User B tries to reopen the table in Datasheet view. The table will be
   opened in Design view as Read-Only without any type of message.

<P><LI>Microsoft Access returns User B's focus to the Database window. User B
   will be able to make changes to the design of the table but will be
   unable to save them. The Save option on the File menu will be dimmed.
<P>
</OL><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior in Microsoft Access version 1.x or 2.0</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Two users (User A and User B) both open the sample database NWIND.MDB,
   non-exclusively.

<P><LI>Both users open the Categories table in Datasheet view.

<P><LI>Both users simultaneously switch to Design view. User A succeeds, but
   User B receives the following error message.
<P>
   In Microsoft Access version 1.x:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Table is in use, cannot lock by user '&lt;user B's logon name&gt;'
      on machine &lt;user B's machine name&gt;'.
</PRE><P>
   In Microsoft Access version 2.0:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Can't open table 'Categories' for modification. Open it read only?
</PRE>
<P><LI>User B tries to reopen the table in Datasheet view and receives
   the following error message:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Couldn't lock table. Table 'Categories' is exclusively
      locked by user '&lt;user A's logon name&gt;' on machine '&lt;user
      A's machine name&gt;'.
</PRE>
<P><LI>User B is returned to the Database window with the following error
   message.
<P>
   In Microsoft Access version 1.x:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Unable to recover from attempt to switch view. Window
      will be closed.
</PRE><P>
   In Microsoft Access version 2.0:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Can't switch to Datasheet view and can't return to Design view.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Microsoft Access returns User B's focus to the Database window.
<P>
</OL>When in Datasheet view (step 3), both users have the table open, non-
exclusively. When they try to switch to Design view, they are actually
closing the table and attempting to re-open it, exclusively.
<P>
In the example above, User A succeeds and User B fails. When User B then
tries to reopen the table (non-exclusively) in Datasheet view, User A
already has the table open exclusively.
<P>
The error message in step 5 in an informational message designed to let
User B know that Microsoft Access is unable to open the table in either
Datasheet or Design view.
