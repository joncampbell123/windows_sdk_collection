<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
How Microsoft Access handles a login to an attached SQL table depends
on how the table was originally attached, and whether the login and
password were saved with the table information. It may also depend on
who attached the SQL table, what rights that person has to that table,
what rights you have to that table, and where the tables are located
(different servers, different databases, same database).
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If the "Save login ID and password locally" option was enabled when a
SQL table is attached, you will not be prompted for a login ID and
password. Instead, you automatically receive the rights to each table
that are appropriate for the login ID used when the table was
attached.
<P>
If this option was not enabled, you are prompted for a login ID and
password once for each unique data source, and you receive the rights
to each table that are appropriate for the login ID that you use.
<P>
NOTE: A unique data source is composed of the unique combination of a
SQL server and a database on that server.
<P>
So, if you attach multiple SQL tables and use different login IDs with
different rights for each table, but do not enable the option to save
the login and password information, the next time you access the
tables, the login ID and password you supply for each data source will
determine the authority you have to the tables from that data source.
