The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access versions 1.0, 1.1, 2.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
When you add or edit records in a form or query datasheet and you attempt
to commit the record by moving from the current record or by closing the
recordset, you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Join is broken by value(s) in fields '&lt;field name&gt;' (in Microsoft
   Access version 1.x)

   -or-

   There is no record in table '&lt;table name&gt;' with key matching field(s)
   '&lt;field name&gt;' (in Microsoft Access version 2.0)

</PRE>In the sample messages above, &lt;field name&gt; identifies the foreign key and
&lt;table&gt; identifies the one-side table.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
You tried to enter or edit data through a query based on more than one
table. In a one-to-many relationship, you entered or edited data on the
"many" side, and a corresponding match based on the join field does not
exist on the "one" side.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
When you add or edit records in a query, if the relationship between two
tables is a one-to-many relationship, only enter values in the linking
field in the "many" table that have matches in the linking field in the
"one" table.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Access knows that a given relationship is a one-to-many
relationship if the field on which the tables are linked or joined is a
primary key (or Indexed - No Duplicates) in one of the tables, but not in
the other table. (The linking field in the "many" table is also known as
the "foreign key.") If a field is updated on the "many" side of a
relationship and does not have a match on the "one" side of the
relationship, an "orphan" would be produced.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Open the query named Order Information.

<P><LI>From the Records menu, choose GoTo, and then select New.

<P><LI>Input a new Order ID and Customer ID. Enter a value in the Customer
   ID field that does not exist in the Customers table.

<P><LI>Press the DOWN ARROW key to move to a new record. Note that the
   following error message is displayed:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Join is broken by value(s) in fields 'Customer ID'
