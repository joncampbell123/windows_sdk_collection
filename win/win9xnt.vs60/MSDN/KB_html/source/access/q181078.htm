The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access versions 7.0, 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
When you use the Dropdown method of a combo box in the Load event of a
form, the combo box list does not automatically drop down when the form
opens.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The form contains a subform that is displayed in Datasheet view.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Use one of the following methods to work around this problem.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1</h3>
 
<P>
Invoke the Dropdown method of the combo box in the Open event instead of in
the Load event.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 2</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create a subform whose DefaultView property is set to Continuous Forms
   and whose ViewsAllowed property is set to Both.

<P><LI>In Design view of the main form that contains the combo box, set the
   SourceObject property of the subform control to the form that you
   created in step 1.

<P><LI>Create another form, which will serve as the subform that you want to
   display on the main form. Set its DefaultView and ViewsAllowed
   properties to Datasheet.

<P><LI>Set the OnLoad property of the form to the following event procedure:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Private Sub Form_Load()
</PRE><P>
<PRE>         Me![ctlDropCombo].SetFocus
         Me![ctlDropCombo].Dropdown
         Me![ContinuousSub].SourceObject = "DatasheetSub"

      End Sub

</PRE></OL>This event procedure assumes that the name of your combo box is
ctlDropCombo, the name of your subform control is ContinuousSub, and the
name of the subform that you created in step 3 is DatasheetSub. Adjust the
code to reflect the names of the combo box, the subform control, and the
datasheet subform in your application.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 3</h3>
 
<P>
Use a subform whose DefaultView property is set to Continuous Forms.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Access versions
7.0 and 97. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Note that this behavior does not occur when you open the form in Form view
directly from Design view.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start Microsoft Access and open the sample database Northwind.mdb.

<P><LI>Create a new form that is not bound to any table or query.

<P><LI>Use the Subform/Subreport Wizard to add Customer Orders Subform 2 to the
   form.

<P><LI>Add a combo box called ctlDropCombo to the form. Set its properties as
   follows:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Name: ctlDropCombo
      Row Source Type: Value List
      Row Source: a;b;c
</PRE>
<P><LI>Set the OnLoad property of the form to the following event procedure:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Private Sub Form_Load()
</PRE><P>
<PRE>         Me![ctlDropCombo].SetFocus
         Me![ctlDropCombo].Dropdown

      End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>Save the form as frmNoDrop and close it.

<P><LI>Open the form in Form view from the Database window. Note that the
   combo box list does not automatically drop down as expected.
