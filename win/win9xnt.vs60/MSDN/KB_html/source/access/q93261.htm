The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access versions 1.0, 1.1, 2.0, 7.0, 97
</UL>

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Novice: Requires knowledge of the user interface on single-user computers.
<P>
When you open a form in Form view, it is completely blank. The form seems
to have no controls or text.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Typically this happens because a query returns no records, or privileges
have been limited.
<P>
A form can also be blank if the header and footer sections occupy so much
space that there is no room for the detail section.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
If the form is based on a query, run the query. If the query returns
no datasheet cells in which to enter data, then there is a problem with
the query (such as unjoined tables). A good query returns empty cells even
if the tables are empty.
<P>
Also, controls located in form header or footer sections are always
visible, even when privilege limits or empty recordsets prevent the
display of controls located in the detail section. Therefore, when you
design a form, place necessary controls, such as command buttons and check
boxes, in the form header or footer section. Also, you should ensure that
each recordset contains at least one record.
<P>
Finally, try reducing the size of the header and footer sections to allow
more room for the detail section.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
A blank form may be displayed in the following situations:

<OL><P><LI>The form is based on a query that contains a one-to-many join, and
   the query returns no records.

<P><LI>The form is not updatable at all. It is a read-only form with the
   AllowUpdating property set to No Tables, or it is a static form that
   displays results by using a GROUP BY clause or a DISTINCT operator.

<P><LI>The form is based on a query that contains a one-to-one join, and one
   of the tables is in a read-only database.

<P><LI>The form is based on a query that contains a many-to-one inner join,
   and the query does not contain all the joined columns of the many-side
   table.

<P><LI>The form is based on a query that includes an updatable remote table
   but does not include all the columns that make up the primary key.

<P><LI>The form is read-only and is based on an empty table.
<P>
</OL><h3>Steps to Reproduce Situation 1</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Open the sample database Northwind.mdb (or NWIND.MDB in versions 1.x
   and 2.0).

<P><LI>Change the Sales By Category query by placing IS NULL in the criteria
   cell for the CategoryName field.
<P>
   NOTE: In Microsoft Access 1.x or 2.0, there is a space in the Category
   Name field.

<P><LI>Create a new form based on the modified query, and place some fields
   and a command button in the form's detail section.

<P><LI>View the form in Form view. Note that a blank form is displayed.
<P>
</OL><h3>Steps to Reproduce Situation 6</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create a new table. Do not enter any data.

<P><LI>Create a new form based on the table. Add a command button and
   make the form read-only.

<P><LI>View the form in Form view. Note that a blank form is displayed.
<P>
</OL>The form is blank in all situations because the recordset is empty.
The form would be displayed as expected if you were adding new records,
but the settings for the form or the joins in the query prevent you from
using the form to add new records.
