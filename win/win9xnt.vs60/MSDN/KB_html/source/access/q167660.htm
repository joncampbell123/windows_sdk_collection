<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
When you create a table in Microsoft Access 97 that is linked to a
Microsoft Exchange folder, there are system imposed limits on what you can
add, change, or delete. This article discusses those restrictions.
<P>
You can download Microsoft Access Wizards that make it easier for you to
link or import Microsoft Exchange folders. The Exchange/Outlook Wizards are
available, free of charge, from Microsoft's World Wide Web site at:
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/accessdev/a-free.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/accessdev/a-free.htm</A></B>

</PRE>For information about installing the Exchange/Outlook driver without using
a wizard, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../access/q159322.htm">Q159322</A></B>
   TITLE     : ACC97: Paradox, Lotus, &amp; MS Exchange/Outlook ISAMs in
               ValuPack

</PRE>NOTE: The information in this article applies to linked tables only. If you
import a Microsoft Exchange table into your database, the limitations
described in this article do not apply.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Linked Microsoft Exchange data is best suited as a read-only reference or
as lookup information in your database. For example, you can use the Global
Address Book to look up e-mail names for message recipients, or you can use
Calendar information to view existing appointments and identify schedule
conflicts.
<P>
However, if you want to modify data in the linked table, the following
sections discuss some of the limitations you will encounter.
<P>
<P><h3>Adding New Records</h3>
 
<P>
When you link a Microsoft Exchange folder in your database, you have no
choice of which fields to display in the table. The subset of fields that
appear in your table are pre-programmed in the Microsoft Messaging Driver,
Msexch35.dll, which manages the connection between Microsoft Access and
Microsoft Exchange.
<P>
When you add a new record to the table, some fields produce the following
error message when you try to enter data:
<P>
<PRE>   Field '&lt;Field Name&gt;' is based on an expression and can't be edited.

</PRE>You cannot update these fields in Microsoft Access; however, once you
identify the fields, you can simplify your data entry by hiding those
columns as follows:

<OL><P><LI>Open the linked table in Datasheet view.

<P><LI>Place the insertion point in a column that does not allow updating.

<P><LI>On the Format menu, click Hide Columns. Note that the column is no
   longer visible.

<P><LI>Repeat steps 2 and 3 for each column you want to hide.
<P>
</OL>To display the columns again:

<OL><P><LI>Open the linked table in Datasheet view.

<P><LI>On the Format menu, click Unhide Columns.

<P><LI>In the Unhide Columns dialog box, click to select the check box for
   those columns you want to display again.
<P>
   NOTE: You can also click to clear the check box for any columns you want
   to hide.

<P><LI>Click Close.
<P>
</OL>Also, if you want Microsoft Outlook to use a specific form to display your
new record, you must enter the correct data in the Message Class field. The
Message Classes for the standard Microsoft Outlook folders are:
<P>
<PRE>   Folder       Message Class
   ----------------------------
   Calendar     IPM.Appointment
   Contacts     IPM.Contact
   Inbox        IPM.Note
   Journal      IPM.Activity
   Notes        IPM.StickyNote
   Tasks        IPM.Task

</PRE></OL><h3>Modifying Records</h3>
 
<P>
You cannot modify any records in a linked Microsoft Exchange table. The
Microsoft Messaging Driver is designed only for reading existing records
and adding new ones.
<P>
<P><h3>Deleting Records</h3>
 
<P>
When you delete a record from a linked Microsoft Exchange table, the record
is immediately and permanently deleted. You cannot use the Undo command to
restore the record, and it does not appear in the Deleted Items folder in
Microsoft Exchange.
<P>
Use caution, and be sure that you really want to delete a selected record
before you actually delete it.
<P>
You can work around this behavior in several ways:

<UL><LI>If you are using Microsoft Access security in your database, you can
   set permissions for the linked table so that deleting records is not
   allowed. This safeguards against accidental deletion of a record at the
   table level.

<LI>If you are using a form based on the linked Microsoft Exchange table,
   you can set the form's AllowDeletions property to False. This will
   prevent anyone from accidentally deleting a record using the form;
   however, you can still delete records directly from the table or a
   query.

<LI>If you are using a form based on the linked table, and you want to allow
   users to delete records, you can set the OnDelete property of the form
   to a macro or event procedure that prompts a user to confirm the
   deletion. For example:
<P>
   NOTE: This example assumes that you are familiar with Visual Basic for
   Applications and with creating Microsoft Access applications using the
   programming tools provided with Microsoft Access. For more information
   about Visual Basic for Applications, please refer to the "Building
   Applications with Microsoft Access 97" manual.
<P>
<P><PRE>      Private Sub Form_Delete(Cancel As Integer)
      ' Display a custom dialog box to confirm deletion.
      If MsgBox ("Are you sure you want to delete this record?", _
<PRE></PRE>                 vbOKCancel) = vbCancel Then
         Cancel = True
      End If
      End Sub
