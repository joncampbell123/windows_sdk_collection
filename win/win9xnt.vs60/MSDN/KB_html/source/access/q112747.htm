<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
This article lists several things you can do to improve the speed and
performance of subforms in your Microsoft Access version 2.0, 7.0, and
Microsoft Access 97 applications.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To improve subform performance, try these tips:

<UL><LI>If you can, base your subforms on queries rather than tables. Include
   only fields from the record source that are absolutely necessary. Extra
   fields can decrease subform performance.

<LI>Index all the fields on the subform that are linked to the main form.
   Indexes help speed the search process to find the matching subform
   records.

<LI>Index any fields used for criteria (such as when a subform is based on
   a criteria query).

<LI>If you are linking on multiple fields, add a calculated field to the
   main form that concatenates the fields. Then, create a calculated column
   in the subform's RecordSource property query with the same expression.
   For example, to link to the subform on an Employee ID field and an
   Order ID field, add a text box to the main form with the following
   properties:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Name: EmployeeIDOrderID
      ControlSource: =[EmployeeID] &amp; [OrderID]
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      NOTE: In Microsoft Access version 2.0, there is a space in the
     [Employee ID] and [Order ID] fields.
</PRE><P>
   Next, add the following field to the query that the subform is based
   on:
<P>
<P><PRE>      EmployeeIDOrderID: [Employee ID] &amp; [Order ID]
</PRE><P>
   Then, link the main form and the subform on the concatenated field
   rather than on the two individual fields. The subform properties might
   look as follows:
<P>
<P><PRE>      LinkChildFields: EmployeeIDOrderID
      LinkMasterFields: EmployeeIDOrderID
</PRE><P>
   Because Microsoft Access only has to compare one criteria to return
   the subform's recordset, the subform's performance should improve.

<LI>Set the subform's DefaultEditing property to Read-Only if the records
   in the subform are not going to be edited.

<LI>If your subform is a continuous form and contains combo boxes,
   explicitly justify the combo box in the subform's form Design view. This
   prevents Microsoft Access from determining the proper justification of
   the combo box values for each record and thus speeds the display of
   subform records which have combo boxes.
