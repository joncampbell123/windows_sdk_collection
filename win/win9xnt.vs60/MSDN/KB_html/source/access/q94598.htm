The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access versions 1.0, 1.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
An error message generated by an action query (that is, a delete,
make-table, update, or append query) may contain the following
incorrect message box text:
<P>
<PRE>   Errors were encountered: The contents of fields in &lt;number&gt;
   record(s) were deleted, &lt;number&gt; record(s) were lost due to
   key violations and &lt;number&gt; record(s) were locked and couldn't
   be modified. Proceed anyway?

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem is caused by the way Microsoft Access handles errors for
action queries. Microsoft Access uses the same error message for every
action query instead of using a separate error message for each type
of action query.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Access versions
1.0 and 1.1. This problem no longer occurs in Microsoft Access version 2.0.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The portion of the above error message that reports key violations:
<P>
<PRE>   &lt;number&gt; record(s) were lost due to key violations

</PRE>becomes active whenever referential integrity is violated during a query.
However, this specific information only applies to Append and Make Table
queries. If an update or delete query violates referential integrity, this
portion of the error message erroneously gives the impression that records
have been lost, when in fact they simply were not updated or deleted.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create the following two tables:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Table: Table1
      ---------------------------
      FieldName: ID  [PrimaryKey]
<PRE></PRE>         DataType: Text
      FieldName: Name
         DataType: Text

      Table: Table2
      -----------------
      FieldName: ID
         DataType: Text
      FieldName: Hobby
         DataType: Text

</PRE><P><LI>Create a one-to-many relationship between Table1 and Table2, with
   ID as the matching field. Enforce referential integrity rules.

<P><LI>Add two records to each table.

<P><LI>Create the following query based on Table1:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Query: Query1
      -------------
      Field: ID
      Field: Name
</PRE>
<P><LI>Change Query1 from a select query to a delete query by choosing
   Delete from the Query menu.

<P><LI>Run Query1 by choosing Run from the Query menu.

<P><LI>Choose the OK button to delete the records.
<P>
</OL>The following error message is displayed:
<P>
<PRE>   Errors were encountered: The contents of fields in 0 record(s) were
   deleted, 2 record(s) were lost due to key violations and 0 record(s)
   were locked and couldn't be modified. Proceed anyway?

</PRE></OL>This message correctly identifies that there were key violations
(because of referential integrity), but it incorrectly indicates the
loss of two records. In actuality, the records were not modified and
therefore not lost.
