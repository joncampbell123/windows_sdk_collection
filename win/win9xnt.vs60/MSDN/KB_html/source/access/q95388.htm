The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access versions 1.0, 1.1, 2.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
When you delete a record in a dBASE or a Microsoft FoxPro database, the
record is actually only marked for deletion. It is not permanently removed
until the database is packed in dBASE or FoxPro. This characteristic can
produce confusing effects when you open an attached table in Datasheet
view.
<P>
This article demonstrates how to use functionality similar to the dBASE
DELETED commands in Microsoft Access so that records marked for deletion do
not appear in any output form, such as a table in Datasheet view or a
report in Print Preview.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In dBASE or FoxPro, records that are marked for deletion still appear in
any output form unless you SET DELETED to ON. Because of this, Microsoft
Access displays such records in an attached dBASE or FoxPro table, even if
the records are marked for deletion.
<P>
To see this characteristic in Microsoft Access, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Attach the dBASE table called NEWCUST.DBF. This table should be present
   in your Microsoft Access program directory if you installed the sample
   databases with Microsoft Access.

<P><LI>Open the NEWCUST table in Datasheet view. Note that there are 13 records
   in this table.

<P><LI>Select the last record in the table by clicking the record selector on
   the leftmost side of the datasheet.

<P><LI>Press the DELETE key. Note that the record disappears from the
   datasheet, leaving 12 records in this table.

<P><LI>Close the Datasheet window and reopen it. Note that all 13 records
   reappear.
<P>
</OL>It may seem that Microsoft Access deleted the record, and then undeleted
it when you reopened the table. In reality, Microsoft Access only marks
the record for deletion, but because the marked record still exists
in the table, Microsoft Access continues to display it in datasheet.
<P>
To prevent this behavior from occurring, Microsoft Access provides
functionality identical to the dBASE and FoxPro SET DELETED command. To
take advantage of this functionality, be sure that you set Deleted to On
if you do not want records that have been marked for deletion to show. Use
the following procedure to do this:

<OL><P><LI>Open the MSACCESS.INI file in any text editor, such as Notepad.

<P><LI>Find the [dBASE ISAM] section.

<P><LI>Change the [dBASE ISAM] setting
<P>
<P><PRE>      Deleted=Off
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      -to-
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      Deleted=On
</PRE>
<P><LI>Save the MSACCESS.INI file and restart Microsoft Access.
<P>
   When you view the dBASE data, records marked for deletion will no
   longer appear. To permanently remove records marked for deletion,
   you must open the dBASE table in dBASE format and run the PACK
   command.
