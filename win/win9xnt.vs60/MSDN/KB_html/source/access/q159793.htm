The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access versions 7.0, 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
When you run Setup for Microsoft Access 7.0 on a computer that already has
Microsoft Access 97 installed, you may receive one of the following pairs
of error messages:
<P>
<PRE>   Can't load mspdox35.dll (error code=1157)
   The configuration of the ODBC Microsoft Paradox Driver (*.db) driver
   failed.

   NOTE: The above error message has also been found to occur when you
   uninstall Microsoft Office 97 and reinstall Microsoft Office 95 or
   attempt to install Microsoft Office 95 after Microsoft Visual Studio
   has been installed.

   Can't load msxbse35.dll (error code=1157)
   The configuration of the ODBC Microsoft dBase Driver (*.dbf) driver
   failed.

   Can't load mstext35.dll (error code=1157)
   The configuration of the ODBC Microsoft Text Driver (*.txt; *.csv)
   driver failed.

   Can't load msexcl35.dll (error code=1157)
   The configuration of the ODBC Microsoft Excel Driver (*.xls) driver
   failed.

   Then you receive a message that Setup was not completed successfully.

   NOTE: The "Can't load mspdox35.dll (error code=1157)" error message was
   also found to occur while uninstalling Microsoft Office 95 after
   Microsoft Office 97 Professional Edition had already been installed.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
You tried to install the Microsoft Access 7.0 driver for Paradox, dBASE,
Microsoft FoxPro, Text, or Microsoft Excel, but you did not install the
corresponding driver for Microsoft Access 97.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
You must rerun Setup for Microsoft Access 97 to install the same drivers
that you are trying to install in Microsoft Access 7.0.
<P>
NOTE: The Paradox ISAM driver, along with the Lotus 1-2-3 and Microsoft
Exchange/Outlook ISAM drivers, are not included in the Setup program for
Microsoft Access 97 or Microsoft Office 97 Professional Edition. They are
included as part of the Microsoft Office 97 ValuPack.
<P>
If the files in the Valupack folder are the only files that need to be
reinstalled, you do not need to rerun Setup of Microsoft Access. You can
run Setup for Dataacc.exe and select the Custom option to install the
drivers in the ValuPack folder.
<P>
For information about obtaining and installing these drivers, please see
the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../access/q159322.htm">Q159322</A></B>
   TITLE     : ACC97: Paradox, Lotus, &amp; MS Exchange/Outlook ISAMs in
               ValuPack

</PRE>NOTE: If the Paradox file is the only file that needs to be installed, you
can run Setup of Dataacc.exe, select the Custom option, and include just
the Paradox driver to get this file properly installed on your computer.
<P>

</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
You can set up and run more than one version of Microsoft Access on a
single computer. However, the Setup program for Microsoft Access 97
installs a new version of the ODBC administrator, ODBC version 3.0, that
looks for and expects Microsoft Access 97 drivers. If you run Setup for
Microsoft Access 7.0 and try to load an earlier version of a driver before
you load the Microsoft Access 97 version, you receive an error message.
<P>
<P><h2>REFERENCES</h2>
 
<P>
For more information about the interaction between 32-bit ISAM drivers and
ODBC 3.0, search the Help Index in the ODBC Microsoft Desktop Database
Drivers Help file for "Overview." You must have the Odbcjet.hlp Help file
installed on your computer to view this Help topic.
