The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access versions 2.0, 7.0, 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
When you use System Monitor in Microsoft Windows 95 or Performance Monitor
in Microsoft Windows NT to track CPU usage, Microsoft Access is reported to
use 100 percent of CPU resources even though it appears that Microsoft
Access is idle.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
During idle time, Microsoft Access continuously polls its message queue to
check for keyboard and mouse activity.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Access was originally designed to operate in the cooperative
multitasking environment that Microsoft Windows 3.x provides. The idle
processing code built into Microsoft Access was designed to ensure that
Microsoft Access does not begin processing background tasks during brief
periods of inactivity, such as when a user pauses between keystrokes. In
the preemptive multitasking environment of Microsoft Windows 95 and
Microsoft Windows NT, this idle processing code causes Microsoft Access to
use 100 percent of CPU resources briefly during idle time.
<P>
Microsoft Access polls its message queues for activity for about the first
30 seconds of idle time. During this time, Performance Monitor reports that
Microsoft Access is using 100 percent of CPU resources.
<P>
NOTE: Microsoft Access only uses CPU resources that are idle. If your
computer has other processes that are ready to run, it will run them.
Microsoft Access does not degrade performance of other applications as it
polls its message queues.
