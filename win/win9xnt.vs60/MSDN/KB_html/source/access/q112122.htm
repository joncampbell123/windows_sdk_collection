The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access version 1.0, 1.1, 2.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
This article describes several issues involved in using Microsoft Access
version 1.x databases in Microsoft Access version 2.0.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following issues should be kept in mind when you are using version 1.x
databases in Microsoft Access version 2.0:

<UL><LI>When you open an unconverted Microsoft Access 1.x database in Microsoft
   Access 2.0, you will receive the message:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Database &lt;database name&gt; was created by a previous version of
      Microsoft Access. You won't be able to save changes made to object
      definitions in this database.
</PRE><P>
   You cannot make any design changes to database objects created in
   version 1.x until you convert the database to version 2.0. Note that
   database objects may behave differently in version 2.0 because of new
   and changed features.
<P>
   You can open and use unconverted databases in version 2.0. However, if
   you want to make design changes to them, use Microsoft Access version
   1.x.

<LI>You cannot change permissions in version 1.x databases using Microsoft
   Access version 2.0. However, if you use a version 1.x SYSTEM.MDA file
   with Microsoft Access 2.0, the existing security scheme will operate
   properly.
<P>
   You can use Microsoft Access version 1.x to make security changes to
   the version 1.x database, but make sure to use the version 1.x
   SYSTEM.MDA file.

<LI>You can update fields on the one side of a one-to-many join.

<LI>A combo or list box displays data as it is formatted in the control's
   underlying table or query. However, if the row source is a SQL SELECT
   statement, no formatting is applied.
<P>
   If you want the data in a combo or list box to be formatted, apply a
   format expression to the field in the query.

<LI>If you attempt to open an object in a version 1.x database whose name
   contains a backquote character (`) in version 2.0, you will receive
   the error message:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Couldn't find object &lt;objectname&gt;
</PRE><P>
   While the backquote character (`) is permitted in object names in
   version 1.x, it violates standard naming conventions in version 2.0.
   In addition to the backquote (`), you cannot use a period (.), an
   exclamation point (!), or brackets ([]) in object names in version
   2.0.
<P>
   Use Microsoft Access 1.x to rename objects in the version 1.x database
   to remove these characters.

<LI>The CTRL+F4 key combination closes only MDI windows (such as the
   Database window) in version 2.0. Use ALT+F4 to close pop-up windows.
   In Microsoft Access 1.x, CTRL+F4 closes both pop-up windows and MDI
   windows. This behavior is changed in version 2.0 to be consistent with
   Microsoft Windows behavior.
<P>
   This means that you should open your version 1.x databases in
   Microsoft Access version 1.x and change all occurrences of {^F4} to
   {%F4} in all SendKeys actions in macros and Access Basic code.

<LI>SendKeys actions to change menus, dialog boxes and property sheets do
   not necessarily produce the same results in version 2.0 as they do in
   version 1.x, since the File, Edit, Layout, and Format menus are
   changed in version 2.0. The Paste Special, Options and Security dialog
   boxes are changed as well. Several changes and additions to object
   property sheets also affect how SendKeys actions set properties.
<P>
   The following items describe how to accommodate these changes:
<P>
<P><PRE>     - Open your version 1.x databases in Microsoft Access version 1.x and
       replace all SendKeys actions in macros and code that reference
       changed menus with DoMenuItem actions.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>     - Set and change security using data access objects (DAO) instead of
       SendKeys. This requires that you first convert the database to
       version 2.0 database format.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>     - Set properties at run time instead of using code that opens objects
       in Design view, changes properties, then opens the same objects in
       Form view. This requires that you first convert the database to
       version 2.0 database format.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>     - Use the GetOption and SetOptions methods instead of SendKeys to
       change options. This requires that you first convert the database
       to version 2.0 database format.
</PRE><P>
   Because changes like these can occur with each new version of
   Microsoft Access, it is best to avoid using the SendKeys action
   whenever possible.

<LI>Tables are the only objects that you can export to a Microsoft Access
   1.x database from a Microsoft Access 2.0 database. You cannot export
   any other object from a version 2.0 database to a version 1.x
   database.
<P>
   Objects in a version 1.x database opened in version 2.0 can be
   exported to a version 2.0 database. However, this process converts
   those objects to version 2.0 objects.
<P>
   You can attach a version 1.x table using version 2.0. You cannot
   attach a version 2.0 table using version 1.x.

<LI>In version 1.x, validation rules for bound controls override
   validation rules for bound fields in the underlying table. In version
   2.0, the validation rules for the field and bound control are
   combined.
<P>
   For example, in version 1.x, if the field validation rule requires the
   value of a numeric field to be greater than 100, and the validation
   rule for a bound control on a form requires the value to be less than
   75, an entry of 50 in the bound control is allowed.
<P>
   The same entry would not be allowed in version 2.0, since the field
   and bound control validation rules are combined, and there is no
   number that is both less than 75 and greater than 100.
<P>
   It is recommended that you review all of your form and field
   validation rules and change them where conflicts occur.
