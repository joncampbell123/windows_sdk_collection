The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
When you try to use a Microsoft Access 7.0 wizard with a local setup of
Microsoft Access 7.0, you may receive one of the following error messages:
<P>
<PRE>   This feature isn't installed.

   -or-

   Microsoft Access Can't Find the Wizard or there is a syntax error in the
   declaration section of the Visual Basic module.

</PRE>For information about troubleshooting these error messages with a
Workstation setup of Microsoft Access 7.0, please see the following article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../access/q162358.htm">Q162358</A></B>
   TITLE     : ACC95: Err "Microsoft Access Can't Find the Wizard" (Wkstn
               Setup)

</PRE>For information about troubleshooting these error messages in Microsoft
Access 97, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../access/q167591.htm">Q167591</A></B>
   TITLE     : ACC97: "Microsoft Access Can't Find the Wizard" Error
               Message

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Below are the possible causes for these errors:

<UL><LI>The wizard is not set up on your computer, or a wizard file is missing.
<LI>You have read-only permissions for the wizard files.
<LI>A type library file is missing or misregistered.
<LI>A file needed to run the wizards is mismatched or corrupted.
<LI>You have mismatched versions of some files that are shared in 
   common with other Microsoft programs.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Each of the possible causes has its own resolution. If you are unsure what
is causing the error, try each resolution in order and check to see if the
wizard is fixed after each one.
<P>
<P><h3>The Wizard Is Not Set Up on Your Computer, or a Wizard File Is Missing</h3>
 
<P>
If you selected a Compact installation when you ran Setup for Microsoft
Access 7.0, then the wizards were not set up on your computer. Or if you
selected a Custom installation, but you cleared the Wizards option, then
the wizards were not set up on your computer.
<P>
For more information about the components installed by the Microsoft Access
7.0 Setup program, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : ACC95: Components Installed by Each Type of Setup

</PRE>To resolve the above issue, do one of the following:

<UL><LI>Use the Regsvr32.exe file to re-register your .dll files.
<P>
   To reregister your .dll files using Regsvr32.exe, do the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>    1. Verify that the Regsvr32.exe file is in your Windows\System
       folder.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    2. Click the Start button, and then click Run.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    3. In the Open box, type the following:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>          Regsvr32 c:\progra~1\common~1\micros~1\dao\dao3032.dll

   NOTE: An alternative method of registering DLLs is to use Windows
   Explorer to find the DLL; then, double-click it, in the Open With
   Box select Regsvr32.exe, and click OK. This creates a permanent
   association of all DLLs with Regsvr32.exe. You can easily register
   other unregistered DLLs by double-clicking them.

</PRE><LI>Check for missing wizards by searching your hard drive for the file
   Wzmain70.mda, which is installed by default in the \Msoffice\Access
   folder. If the file is missing, you might not have installed the

</PRE></UL><h3>You Have Read-Only Permissions for the Wizard Files</h3>
 
<P>
If the wizard files are set to read-only by any combination of network
permissions, file permissions, or user permissions, then the wizards may
fail. Check your user permissions for the folder that contains the
Microsoft Access 7.0 program, and check that the read-only file attribute
is not set for any of the following files in that same folder:
<P>
<PRE>   Msau7032.dll
   Wd95acc.tlb
   Wzcnf70.mda
   Wzdat70.mdt
   Wzlib70.mda
   Wzmain70.mda
   Wztool70.mda

</PRE><h3>A Type Library File Is Missing or Misregistered</h3>
 
<P>
Search your hard drive for the file Dao2532.tlb. The file is set up by
default in the \Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Dao folder (for
Microsoft Windows 95) or in the \Winnt\Msapps\Dao folder (for Microsoft
Windows NT version 3.51). In Microsoft Windows NT version 4.0 the file may
be in either folder, depending on how the operating system was installed.
<P>
If you find Dao2532.tlb on your computer, do one of the following:

<UL><LI>Run the Setup program with a command-line option that resets the Windows
   Registry settings for Microsoft Access:
<P>
<P><PRE>    1. Insert the Microsoft Access for Windows 95 Disk 1 or the Microsoft
       Office Professional for Windows 95 CD-ROM in the appropriate drive.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    2. In Microsoft Windows 95 or Windows NT version 4.0, click the Start
       button on the taskbar, and then click Run.

       click Run on the File menu.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    3. Type a command to run the Setup program using the /y switch, for
       example
</PRE><P>
<PRE>          &lt;Drive&gt;:\setup /y

       where &lt;Drive&gt; is the drive letter for your diskette or CD-ROM.

    4. In the Installation Maintenance dialog box, click Reinstall.

    5. When the Setup program is finished, start Microsoft Access and try
       to run the wizard.

   To reregister your .dll files using Regsvr32.exe, do the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>    1. Verify that the Regsvr32.exe file is in your Windows\System
       folder.

Once you determine that none of the previous steps resolve the error
message you receive when you try to run a wizard, you must remove and
reinstall Microsoft Access for Windows 95 or Microsoft Office Professional
for Windows 95.

The Setup program will not remove any Microsoft Office files that you
created from your hard drive. However, it is strongly recommended that you
back up any Microsoft Office files that are important to you before you
follow these steps.
