The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access version 2.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multiuser skills.
<P>
When you are working with an attached Btrieve table, you may receive the
following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Unexpected error from external database driver [7]

</PRE>Or, a query based on an attached Btrieve table does not return any records
in Microsoft Access version 2.0. This same query does return records
correctly in Microsoft Access version 1.x.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The problems stated above are caused by an error in the BTRV200.DLL Btrieve
ISAM driver that is installed by Microsoft Access 2.0.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
An updated Btrieve ISAM driver is available in the Microsoft Software
Library (MSL). This driver is for use by registered owners of Microsoft
Access version 2.0 and Microsoft Visual Basic version 3.0 for Windows -
Professional Edition only. By downloading this driver, you are indicating
that you are a registered owner of one of these products. For downloading
instructions, please see the "INSTRUCTIONS FOR DOWNLOADING" section later
in this article.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Access version
2.0. This problem no longer occurs with the Microsoft Jet database engine
version 2.5, which is available with the Microsoft Access version 2.0
Service Pack. For information about how to obtain the Service Pack,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>

   TITLE     : WX1124: Microsoft Access Version 2.0 Service Pack

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
You can differentiate between the original and updated drivers by checking
the file sizes. The original BTRV200.DLL file has a file size of 110,592
bytes. The updated file has a file size of 110,624 bytes. For a network
installation of Microsoft Access, install the updated file in the
ACCESS\SYSTEM directory. For a stand-alone installation of Microsoft
Access, install the updated file in the WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory.
<P>
NOTE: Do not install the updated file before installing Microsoft Access.
You should install Microsoft Access first, then install the updated driver.
<P>
<P><h3>How to Install the Updated Driver After Downloading</h3>
 
<P>
Stand-Alone Installation:

<OL><P><LI>Make a backup copy of the original BTRV200.DLL file by renaming it, or
   by copying it to another location. The BTRV200.DLL file is in the
   WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory.

<P><LI>Copy the updated BTRV200.DLL file to the WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory.
<P>
</OL>Network Installation:

<OL><P><LI>The network administrator should make a backup copy of the original
   BTRV200.DLL file by renaming it, or by copying it to another location.
   The BTRV200.DLL file is in the ACCESS\SYSTEM directory on the network
   server.

<P><LI>The network administrator should copy the updated BTRV200.DLL file to
   the ACCESS\SYSTEM directory on the network server.

<P><LI>The network administrator should make a backup copy of the SETUP.INF
   file by renaming it, or by copying it to another location. The SETUP.INF
   file is located in the ACCESS installation directory on the network
   server.

<P><LI>The network administrator should open the SETUP.INF file in any text
   editor (such as Windows Notepad), and change the line that reads
<P>
<P><PRE>     "DLL"= 1,SYSTEM\BTRV200.DLL,,,,,,1033,,,,,,,SHARED,110592,,,,2.0.0.13,
</PRE><P>
   to read:
<P>
<P><PRE>     "DLL"= 1,SYSTEM\BTRV200.DLL,,,,,,1033,,,,,,,SHARED,110592,,,,2.0.0.15,
</PRE>
<P><LI>After making this change, the network administrator should save and then
   close the SETUP.INF file.
<P>
   This modification changes the internal version from 2.0.0.13 to
   2.0.0.15. Changing the internal version number in the SETUP.INF file
   will cause future workstation installations of Microsoft Access to
   install the updated Btrieve driver on workstations that have a copy of
   the original Btrieve driver.

<P><LI>The network administrator should make the updated BTRV200.DLL file
   available to those who have installed Microsoft Access to their local
   workstation hard disks. These users should copy the updated file to
   their WINDOWS\SYSTEM directories.
