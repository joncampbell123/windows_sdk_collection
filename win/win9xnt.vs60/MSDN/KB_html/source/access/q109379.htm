The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access versions 1.0 and 1.1
<LI>Microsoft Access Distribution Kit version 1.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
To prevent Microsoft Access from being installed locally on workstations
with the SETUP /N command, you need to modify the STFSETUP.IN_ file that
was placed in the INSTALL directory by the administrator setup command
SETUP /A.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If the Setup program is run on a workstation and you have not modified the
STFSETUP.IN_ file, the following message will be displayed on the
workstation:
<P>
<PRE>   You can use the copy of Microsoft Access on your network, or you can
   install Microsoft Access on your hard disk. If you install Microsoft
   Access on your hard disk, it will run faster, but it will take up space
   on your hard disk.

   Do you want to install Microsoft Access on your hard disk?

</PRE>If the Yes option is chosen, the Setup program will copy all the files
necessary to run Microsoft Access locally to the workstation's hard disk.
If the No option is chosen, the Setup program will copy only those files
necessary to let Microsoft Access run on the workstation from the server.
<P>
The following steps describe how to modify the STFSETUP.IN_ file so that
the message stated above will not appear when the Setup program is run from
a workstation. The Setup program will instead automatically configure the
workstation to run Microsoft Access from the network server:

<OL><P><LI>Make a backup copy of the STFSETUP.IN_ file by copying the file to
   another disk or directory.

<P><LI>Open the STFSETUP.IN_ file located in the INSTALL directory on the
   network server in a text editor such as Windows Write. Do not allow
   the editor to change the format of the file--the file must remain an
   ASCII, or text, file. Note that the STFSETUP.IN_ file is too large to
   be opened in Notepad.

<P><LI>Locate the section of the STFSETUP.IN_ file that contains the
   following lines:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ifstr $(STF_MODE) == "NETWORK"
<PRE></PRE>         read-syms "Copy Local"
         ui start MessageBox
         set LocalCopy = $(DLGEVENT)
         ifstr $(DLGEVENT) == "NO"
            set INIPATH = $(WINDOWSPATH)
            read-syms "Minimum Options"
            set COPYPROG = "OFF"
         else
            set CIRPATH2 = $(HD)$(CIRDIR)
         endif
      endif

   Note that an easy way to find this section is to use the text editor's
   Find function to locate the second occurrence of the text "Copy Local".

</PRE><P><LI>Modify the lines in this section as follows:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ifstr $(STF_MODE) == "NETWORK"
<PRE></PRE>         ;read-syms "Copy Local"
         ;ui start MessageBox
         ;set LocalCopy = $(DLGEVENT)
         set LocalCopy = "NO"
         ;ifstr $(DLGEVENT) == "NO"
            set INIPATH = $(WINDOWSPATH)
            read-syms "Minimum Options"
            set COPYPROG = "OFF"
         ;else
            ;set CIRPATH2 = $(HD)$(CIRDIR)
         ;endif
      endif

</PRE><P><LI>Save the modified STFSETUP.IN_ file, and then close the editor.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: When you are saving the file, do not allow the editor to change the
format of the file--it must remain a plain ASCII, or text, file.
<P>
After these modifications have been made, running the Setup program on a
workstation will automatically result in a configuration on the workstation
to run Microsoft Access from the network server.
<P>
NOTE: Make sure, when you are editing an STFSETUP.IN_ file generated by the
Microsoft Access Distribution Kit's SetupWizard, not to make any
modifications below the
<P>
<PRE>   ;================================================
   ;DO NOT MODIFY BELOW THIS LINE
   ;================================================

</PRE></OL>section in the file. Modifications below this section are not supported.
