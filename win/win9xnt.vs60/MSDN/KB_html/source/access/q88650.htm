The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access versions 1.0, 1.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Some applications require password protection and should provide a dialog
box at startup which prompts the user for a password. For security
purposes, this prompt should not show the characters that the user is
typing, but should give the user some idea of how many characters have
been typed so that the user does not lose track of what part of the
password is being typed. This article describes how you can create a
password text box in Microsoft Access version 1.x.
<P>
In Microsoft Access version 2.0, you can use input masks for typing data
into a field or control. There is an input mask specifically for password
entry. For more information, search for "input masks," using the Microsoft
Access 2.0 Help menu.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To create a password text box:

<OL><P><LI>Create a form and open it in Design view.

<P><LI>Add a text box and select it so that it has the focus.

<P><LI>In the toolbar, drop down the list of fonts located directly to the
   right of the Paint Pallette toolbar button.

<P><LI>From the list, choose Courier.

<P><LI>In the toolbar, drop down the list of font sizes located directly to
   the right of the list of fonts from which you just made a  selection.

<P><LI>From the list, choose the value 10.

<P><LI>From the palette window, click on the color White for both the Fill row
   and Text row of colors.

<P><LI>Save the form and switch to Form view.
<P>
</OL>When you type characters into the password text box, notice that they do
not appear, but the cursor is present. The Courier font assigned to the
text box makes cursor movement and position clearly identifiable so that
the user has an idea of how many characters have been typed.
