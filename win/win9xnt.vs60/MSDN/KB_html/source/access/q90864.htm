<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Novice: Requires knowledge of the user interface on single-user computers.
<P>
Microsoft Access saves printer driver information with each form or report
that it generates. This means you do not have to set up the printer with
the correct driver in order to print out a form or report--the form or
report "remembers" the correct driver and uses it. For example, you can
save one form using a PostScript printer driver and another form using the
generic text driver.
<P>
NOTE: If the Default Printer option button is selected, the form will be
printed to the Windows default printer.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If the printer that the printer driver requires is not currently
connected, Microsoft Access displays a dialog box stating that the printer
is not available and enables you to select another printer.
<P>
Bear in mind that some text formatting depends on the current printer
driver. For example, if you format a document with a PostScript printer
font instead of a software font (such as a TrueType font) and send the
document to a PostScript printer, everything should be printed correctly.
However, if you send the document to a LaserJet, you will receive output
errors because some PostScript printer fonts are not available on a
LaserJet.
<P>
A driver-related problem could be something such as the sudden appearance
of the Zapf Dingbats font in a form or report set up to use the Windows
System font and sent to a PostScript printer. This problem occurs because
the Windows System font is not available on PostScript printers. When a
font is unavailable, Windows attempts to find an equivalent among those on
the printer, searching through them alphabetically. In this case, it
arrives at the Zapf Dingbats font last and uses it because there are no
other options.
<P>
The best way to avoid these problems is to create all your forms and
reports with TrueType fonts, which appear correctly in print preview and
are processed the same way by all printers.
