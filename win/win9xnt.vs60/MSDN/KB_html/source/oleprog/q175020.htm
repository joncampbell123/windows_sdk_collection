The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Win32 Software Development Kit (SDK) on the following
   platforms:
<P><PRE>    - Windows 95
    - x86
</UL></PRE> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When a COM client on a Windows NT machine runs under an identity that
cannot be authenticated on the remote machine, a COM server started by the
client will shut down in approximately six minutes.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem is caused by a bug in the ping component of the NT OXID
resolver process (Rpcss.exe). Even though the activation is unsecure, the
ping client in the resolver process attempts secure pings. This problem
does not happen with the DCOM95 resolver process.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
At present there is no way to resolve this problem except to run the client
under a user account that can be validated on the server. This could either
be a Windows NT domain account that is known on the server or a local
machine account that exists on the server (if the server is on a Windows NT
machine). In case of the latter, the ASCII user name and password of the
account on the client and the server must match exactly.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested
and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem.
Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix.
Contact Microsoft Product Support Services for more information.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The problem only occurs when the COM client is on a Windows NT machine. COM
clients on DCOM95 machines will not have this problem.
