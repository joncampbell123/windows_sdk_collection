<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When a client requests a class object for a registered class, COM either
returns an existing class object or launches a process that is registered
as containing the requested class object. The process of obtaining a class
object reference for a requesting client (whether or not that results in
process creation or "launching") is called "activation."
<P>
Under certain conditions, COM may launch a new server process even when an
existing class object is running and has been registered as multiple use.
Moreover, when COM creates a new process that process may be launched in a
new security environment known as a "window station" rather than sharing an
existing window station such as the interactive window station. (For more
information on window stations, search the Win32 SDK documentation for that
phrase.)
<P>
Understanding COM's algorithms for creating new processes and window
stations during an activation request is important for several reasons.
First, COM may create more than one process instance of a multiple-use
class object because of security issues. Second, "single-use" servers will
always be launched in separate processes, but they may or may not be
launched in separate window stations. This difference might manifest itself
to application code in certain unusual cases, such as when two COM servers
try to communicate via window messages or secure communication facilities
such as COM or RPC. Third, since the number of window stations that can
simultaneously be created in Windows NT is limited, it is important to know
when your COM server gets a new window station.
<P>
This article examines different activation scenarios and explains when new
processes and window stations are created.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When COM creates a new server process or assigns a new window station to a
new server process depends on several factors:

<OL><P><LI>The security identity under which the COM class is set to start. The
   identity of a class can be set via the DCOMCNFG tool and is specified by
   the RunAs named value under the AppID key for the class.

<P><LI>Single-use vs multiple-use registration by class objects.

<P><LI>The Security Identifier(SID) of the client process (this is the numeric
   value that represents a particular user account/security
   identity/principal in a Windows NT environment).

<P><LI>The Logon Identifier (LUID) of the client process.(A new logon
   identifier is generated for each unique logon to a computer running
   Windows NT. This logon could be either through a user typing in a user
   name and password at the NT logon prompt, or through a call to the win32
   API LogonUser.)

<P>
</OL><h3>Multiple-use Classes</h3>
 
<P>
A multiple-use class is a class that is registered with COM (via
CoRegisterClassObject() API) specifying the REGCLS_MULTIPLEUSE flag. For
such a class, COM normally uses the same instance of the server process for
all client activation requests. However, for classes configured to run
under the security of the launching users and in a few other cases, COM
launches a new instance of the server process to service activation
requests. When a new instance of the server process is thus launched, it is
possible that the server process gets a new window station as well. We will
examine the various scenarios below, but first we will discuss briefly why
COM launches new processes containing requested class objects when an
instance of the class object is already registered as a "multiple-use"
class.
<P>
First, when a COM class (more accurately, when an AppID associated with a
COM class) is registered with the system to be run as "the launching user,"
the system administrator has set a certain security policy with respect to
that class. The policy is that an activator should receive a class object
inside a process that is running in the same security context as the
activating code.
<P>
This security policy can come into conflict with the server-defined
behavior of having only one class factory object for all activation
requests (as indicated by REGCLS_MULTIPLEUSE). COM prioritizes the security
policy over application behavior. As a result, multiple-use servers
registered to run as "the launching user" will not behave according to the
normal rules of multiple-use. A new process will be launched for each
activating security principal.
<P>
Second, if a process not launched by COM running in a security context
different from the one specified for the given CLSID registers that CLSID,
that registration will fail(CoRegisterClassObject will return an error code
CO_E_WRONG_SERVER_IDENTITY in this case). And, if an activation request
later arrives a new process will be launched by COM with the security
context specified for the CLSID/AppID. COM can't trust code calling
CoRegisterClassObject() (an unsecured operation), it can only trust the
registry setting (the registry is a secure database) to determine which
class object to use and how to run it. This behavior prevents illicit
machine-wide spoofing of class objects by unauthorized users.
<P>
With that in mind, we now return to the issue of when new processes and
window stations are created when multiple-use servers are launched by COM.
Notice that the LUID of the client does not matter in any way in the
multiple-use class case.

<OL><P><LI>"Interactive user" security identity.
<P>
   In the case where a multiple-use COM class's AppID is configured to run
   as the "Interactive User" identity, the very first server process and
   its class object will be used by COM to service all subsequent
   activation requests. This server instance will have the interactive
   window station, if one exists (if no user is logged on locally then all
   activation requests will fail).
<P>
   As noted above, if a process not launched by COM and not running in the
   interactive window station registers the CLSID, that registration will
   fail. And, if an activation request later arrives, a new process will be
   launched with the security context of the Interactive User. This
   behavior prevents illicit spoofing of class objects.
<P>
   Since no additional server processes are ever started by COM, the
   question of new window stations is moot. The SID of the client, its LUID
   or whether it is local or remote does not matter in this case.

<P><LI>"This user" security identity.
<P>
   Similarly, if a multiple-use COM class's AppID is configured to run as
   "this user" (a predefined security ID), the first server process and its
   class object will be used by COM to service all subsequent activation
   requests. This first server instance will have its own window station
   created as part of the first process creation. Since no additional
   server processes are ever started by COM, the question of additional
   window stations is moot. The SID of the client, its LUID or whether it
   is local or remote does not matter in this case.
<P>
   Note that a new window station will be created when you launch the first
   instance of a class/AppID configured to run as "This user," even if the
   same user is currently logged on in the interactive winstation. COM
   never uses the interactive winstation to launch a server configured to
   run as "This user" because that would result in different behavior for
   the class depending upon the unrelated issue of the identity of the
   currently logged on user.
<P>
   As noted above, if a process not launched by COM and not running in the
   account specified in "This user" attempts to register the CLSID, that
   registration will fail and if an activation request later arrives a new
   process will be launched in the "This user" account. This behavior
   prevents illicit spoofing of class objects.
<P>
   On the other hand, if the process registered for a given CLSID/APPID is
   configured to run as "This user," is created in the appropriate user
   account by some agent other than COM (for example, it is run by the
   interactive user when the interactive user is the same user as "This
   user" or it is started via CreateProcess() by a service running in the
   same security context as "this user"), and it then registers its
   REGCLS_MULTIPLEUSE class objects, COM will use the existing running
   class object to satisfy subsequent incoming activation requests from any
   client.

<P><LI>"Launching user" security identity.
<P>
   In this case, the class's AppID is set to launch under the "Launching
   User" idenitity (this is also known as an "Activate as Activator"
   class).
<P>
   a. Local client.
<P>
<P><PRE>      First consider the local machine case. There are two rules:
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      1. Each different activation client SID will cause COM to launch a
<PRE></PRE>         new instance of the server process even in the same window
         station.

      2. Even for matching SIDs (such as the case where the same user is
         logged on more than once to a single NT machine), each different
         local client window station will cause COM to launch a new
         instance of the server process.

      In other words, launching user identity multiple-use servers are
      never shared across window stations. All client processes with the
      same SID and same window stations will share a single server process
      in the same window station. Since the server shares the window
      station of the client no new window stations are created.

      For example, assume that you are interactively logged on as
      a_domain\a_user. You run multiple instances of the client, all of
      which will connect to the same instance of the server(which has the
      interactive window station). Now let's say you have a client, which
      is a service, that is set to launch start under a_domain\a_user. This
      service will launch a new instance of the COM server. This happens
      because COM will cause a new instance of the server to be launched
      since the service process has a window station other than the
      interactive window station--even though the identity of the
      service(client) process is the same as the identity of the running
      server process (a_domain\a_user). However, note that no new window
      station is created for the COM server process. The server will still
      inherit the window station of the service. If the service is set to
      start under LocalSystem and to interact with the desktop (refer to
      "Allow Service to Interact with Desktop" check box in the Service
      applet in control panel), then the service will run in the
      interactive window station or winsta0. In this case COM will still
      start a new instance of the server (client's SID which is LocalSystem
      in this case is different from that of the server's SID which is
      a_domain\a_user)in the interactive window station.

   b. Remote client.

      In the case of remote activation, COM ignores the window station of
      the client because the client is remote, unlike the local case above.
      The rule here is that each new client SID will cause a new instance
      of the server process to be launched and each new server process will
      get a new window station. Subsequent activation requests by remote
      clients with the same SID will reuse the existing registered class
      object as well as its process and window station. For example, assume
      that you are logged on as a_domain\a_user on 10 different machines.
      The clients from all these machines will connect to the same instance
      of the server on the server machine. A client from a a_domain\b_user
      machine will launch a new server instance and a new window station.

      Remote callers with the same SID as a local user that has launched
      the COM server registered for the requested CLSID will reuse the
      existing class object. However, the order in which the COM server is
      started is important in this case. If the server is launched by the
      local client first, then the remote client with the same SID will
      connect to this server. On the other hand, if the server is launched
      by the remote client first, then a local client with the same SID
      will start a new instance of the server. This goes back to the window
      station rules mentioned above. For local clients, the window station
      of the client and the server must match, for remote clients the
      window station of the client is ignored. For example, if local client
      a_domain\a_user launches the server first, then remote client
      a_domain\a_user will connect to the server. Conversely, if remote
      client a_domain\a_user launches the server first, then local client
      a_domain\a_user will launch a new server instance and a new window
      station.

      The LUID of the client does not matter in this case.

</PRE><P><LI>Service-based COM servers.
<P>
   A COM class/AppID that is packaged in a Win32 service is by practical
   necessity a multiple-use server since services can be launched only
   once. In this case, at the first activation request a new process is
   launched in its own window station. There are two exceptions to this:
<P>
   a. If the service is set to launch under the LocalSystem account, it
<P><PRE>      will inherit a system pre-defined window station.
</PRE><P>
   b. If the service is set to launch under the LocalSystem account and can
<P><PRE>      interact with the desktop, it will inherit the interactive window
      station or winsta0. All subsequent activation requests, whether local
      or remote, are handled by the service's class object.
</PRE><P>
   As noted above, if a process not launched by COM and not running as the
   specified service registers the CLSID, that registration will fail and
   if an activation request later arrives the registered service will be
   launched. This behavior prevents illicit spoofing of class objects.
<P>
</OL><h3>Single-Use Classes</h3>
 
<P>
NOTE: Single-Use classes should be avoided as much as possible. Single-use
registration is a legacy setting and is intended to support older COM
applications and to ease the porting of legacy non-COM applications to COM.
It is strongly recommended that new classes be designed to support multiple-
use class object registration. This is especially true in the case of
servers with "This User" identity, where single-use classes cause the exact
opposite effect of multi-use classes. They create a new server process and
new window station per activation and, as we discuss below, this can cause
resource problems under Windows NT.
<P>
A single-use class is one that is registered with COM (via the
CoRegisterClassObject() API) specifying the REGCLS_SINGLEUSE flag. For such
a class, COM will always start a new instance of the class's server process
for each activation request from any client (local or remote). For purposes
of this article, the remaining question is: when will the server get a new
window station as well?

<OL><P><LI>"Interactive user" security identity.
<P>
   Take the case in which the single-use class is set via its AppID to
   start under the "Interactive User" identity. For this case, each new
   instance of the server process will always share the interactive window
   station, if one exists (if no user is logged on locally then all
   activation requests will fail). No new window station will be created by
   COM.

<P><LI>"This user" security identity.
<P>
   Now consider the case where the single-use COM class's AppId is set to
   run under the "This User" identity. In this case, the rule is very
   simple. Every new client activation launches a new process in a new
   window station. This is true regardless of whether the user specified as
   "This User" is logged on to the interactive window station at the time
   of any of the activation requests.

<P><LI>"Launching user" security identity.
<P>
   a. Local client.
<P>
<P><PRE>      In the local machine activation scenario, the server process will
      always get the window station of the client. No new window stations
      are ever created. For example, assume that you are interactively
      logged on as a_domain\a_user and you run multiple instances of the
      client program. Each new resulting instance of the server will get
      the interactive window station. Now assume that the client is a
      service running under the local system account. The COM server in
      this case will share the window station of the service process.
</PRE><P>
<P>
   b. Remote client.
<P>
<P><PRE>      In the remote activation case, COM ignores the window station of the
      client since the client is remote. As always, a new server instance
      process will be started for each remote activation. The rules are:
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      1. For each new remote client SID, a new window station will be
<PRE></PRE>         created for the server process.
      2. For each new remote client LUID, a new window station will be
         created for the server process.
      3. All remote clients with the same SID/LUID pair will create servers
         that will share the same window station.

       For example, you are logged on the remote client machine as
       a_domain\a_user. This client launches the remote server that will
       get a new window station. Now, if a_domain\a_user starts a second
       instance of the client application from the same client machine
       which in turn launches a new copy of the server on the remote
       machine, this server will share the original server's window
       station. Now assume you log on to another machine again as
       a_domain\a_user, and run the client from there. The corresponding
       server instance will have a new window station. This demonstrates
       that even if the client SIDs are the same, since the second client
       has a different LUID, its server process will get a new window
       station.

</PRE><P><LI>Service-based COM servers.
<P>
   Single-use classes should never be implemented as Windows NT services.
   It makes no sense, because it is not possible to run multiple instances
   of an Windows NT service process.

<P><h3>Window Stations and Windows NT Resources</h3>
 
<P>
In this section we will examine the implications of creating new window
stations under Windows NT and how that should affect the configuration of
your COM server. As you will see, there is a limit to the number of window
stations that can be created on a Windows NT machine. When that limit is
exceeded, Windows NT will fail an attempt by COM to launch a new instance
of the server process. Typically, an error message like the following
appears:
<P>
<PRE>   Initialization of the dynamic link library
   d:\winnt\system32\kernel32.dll failed. The process is terminating
   abnormally.

</PRE>Under Windows NT, each window station has at least one desktop associated
with it. Windows NT uses a special memory heap for all windows applications
running on a desktop. By default, each desktop heap consumes 3MB of memory.
Windows NT has a non-configurable limit of 48MB for creating desktop heaps.
This means that the maximum number of window stations that can be created
on a Windows NT machine is 16 (probably less because a window station can
contain more than one desktop). To increase this number, you can reduce the
default desktop heap size by editing the registry using the Registry
Editor.
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them.
Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of
Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.
<P>
The named value you need to edit appears under the following key:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session
   Manager\SubSystems

</PRE>You need to edit the "Windows" named value. It is a REG_SZ string. Edit the
string and look for "Shared Section=1024,3072". Modify this to read "Shared
Section=1024,3072,512". You need to restart the machine for this change to
take effect. By making this change, you are specifying 3MB (default) heap
size for the interactive window station's desktop and 512 KB for all non-
interactive desktops (the first parameter is obsolete but should not be
changed). This change will allow the creation of approximately less than
48MB/512KB or 96 window stations.
<P>
NOTE: A window station can contain multiple desktops within it. In the
discussion of "Launching User" servers above, wherever the window station
of the local client process is mentioned, it should be considered as a
shorter form for "window station and desktop". "Launching User" setting is
really meant for legacy non-DCOM aware servers and should be used rarely.
Such legacy servers expect to run in their own desktops. Thus, for
MULTIPLEUSE "Launching User" servers, each client process in a different
desktop within the same window station causes a new server process to be
started in that window station/desktop. For SINGLEUSE "Launching User"
servers, again, the server inherits the windows station/desktop of the
client process.
