<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
OLE is a technology that enables an application to create compound
documents that contain information from a number of different sources. For
example, a document in an OLE-enabled word processor can accept an embedded
spreadsheet object. Unlike traditional "cut and paste" methods where the
receiving application changes the format of the pasted information,
embedded documents retain all their original properties. If the user
decides to edit the embedded data, Windows activates the originating
application and loads the embedded document.
<P>
This article provides an overview of the OLE libraries; discusses the
VTBL (virtual method table) data structure, which is a required
element of each OLE application; and discusses using the Windows
clipboard in an OLE application.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>OLECLI.DLL -- The OLE Client Library</h3>
 
<P>
OLECLI.DLL, the OLE client library in
the Microsoft Windows environment, provides services to simplify an
OLE client application. Bidirectional communication takes place
between a client application and the OLE client library. A client
application calls functions in the client library to perform OLE tasks
such as object creation, rendering, loading, and saving. The client
library sends status information to the application by calling an
application-defined callback function. The status data the library
passes to the client's callback function includes notification that an
object has been changed, renamed, saved, or closed by an OLE server
application.
<P>
<P><h3>OLESVR.DLL -- The OLE Server Library</h3>
 
<P>
OLESVR.DLL, the OLE server library, provides services for an OLE
server application. Bidirectional communication takes place between a
server application and the OLE server library. A server application
calls functions in the server library to register itself as available,
or to revoke its availability. It also calls server library functions
to indicate when it saves or renames a document. The server library
conveys information to the server application through a set of 27
application-defined callback functions. Each of the server
application's callback functions, which are commonly called methods,
is called to request that the server perform a specific action, or to
inform it that a specific event has occurred.
<P>
<P><h3>Object Handlers</h3>
 
<P>
An end-user is typically concerned only with two types of OLE
applications: client applications and server applications. However, an
application developer must also be aware of a third type of OLE module
called an object handler. An object handler is a dynamic-link library
(DLL) that can be conceptualized as a limited-function server
application. An object handler contains functions required to support
a server application's object classes. For example, when a client
application invokes an object's verb, this call can be processed by an
object handler that loads into memory, processes the call, and unloads
from memory without any assistance from the main server application.
An object handler provides an efficient way to manage objects, because
a handler is typically small and can be loaded and unloaded more
efficiently than an (often large) full-function server application. An
object handler is implemented using the OLE server library just like a
fully-functioned server application.
<P>
<P><h3>Using VTBLs</h3>
 
<P>
As noted above, communication from the OLE client library to a client
application, and from the OLE server library to a server application,
takes place through application-defined callback functions. During the
initialization of a client or server application, it calls the
appropriate library with a pointer to a VTBL data structure. The
library uses the pointers in the VTBL to call the application's
callback functions.
<P>
For example, one of the VTBLs that a server application provides to
the OLE server library is called an OLESERVERVTBL. The server
application fills the OLESERVERVTBL structure with pointers to six
callback functions that implement the Create, CreateFromTemplate,
Edit, Exit, Open, and Release methods. Once the server application
passes the initialized VTBL to the server library, the library can
call any of the six methods just by dereferencing pointers in the
VTBL. Note that using a VTBL allows the OLE libraries to call an
application-defined function that implements a method independent of
the function's name.
<P>
To programmers familiar with the C++ language, the VTBL concept may
seem similar to the C++ virtual method concept. In fact, VTBLs and
virtual methods are closely related. A VTBL allows the OLE libraries
to specify the methods that a client or server application must
implement, while allowing the implementation of each method to be
defined differently for each object class.
<P>
<P><h3>Inter-library Communication</h3>
 
<P>
In the initial implementation of the OLE libraries, provided with
version 3.1 of the Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK),
the libraries communicate with each other using the dynamic data
exchange (DDE) messaging protocol. The client and server libraries
send each other a standard set of OLE commands using WM_DDE_EXECUTE
messages. This implementation of the OLE libraries does not use the
Dynamic Data Exchange Management Library (DDEML) developed for Windows
version 3.1 because the DDEML and the OLE libraries were developed in
parallel. Future versions of the OLE libraries may use the DDEML or
another interprocess communication mechanism.
<P>
The inter-library communication protocol used by the OLE libraries is
hidden by the libraries themselves and it should not affect the design
of an OLE client or server application.
<P>
<P><h3>The Shell Library</h3>
 
<P>
Many OLE applications also use a third library, SHELL.DLL. The shell
library provides API functions that allow an application to read and
modify the Windows registration database. The registration database
contains information about the OLE servers installed on the system,
and the object classes and verbs that each supports. The shell library
also provides support for drag-and-drop manipulation of files using
the Windows File Manager. If an OLE client implements drag-and-drop
support, a file may be dragged from the File Manager and dropped on a
document in a client application to embed the file in the document.
<P>
<P><h3>Placing an OLE Object on the Clipboard</h3>
 
<P>
The presentation format used to display an object specifies the
object's appearance. When a server application places an object on the
clipboard, it supplies one or more graphical representations of the
object. These representations can include the metafile
(CF_METAFILEPICT) format, the device-dependent bitmap (CF_BITMAP)
format, or the device-independent bitmap (CF_DIB) format. When the
user pastes an object into a container document in a client
application, the OLE libraries use one of these presentation formats
to display the object. Because a bitmap or a metafile commonly changes
appearance when it is resized, the appearance of an object may vary
depending on the presentation format used to display the object.
<P>
An embedded object is stored on the clipboard in the OwnerLink format,
the Native format, and one of the three presentation formats described
above (CF_METAFILEPICT, CF_BITMAP, or CF_DIB). Each presentation and
predefined Windows format is represented by a named constant in the
WINDOWS.H header file included with the SDK. However, the OwnerLink
and Native formats, which are used by every OLE application, are not
defined in WINDOWS.H. Each OLE application must call the
RegisterClipboardFormat function to register the OwnerLink and Native
formats with Windows.
