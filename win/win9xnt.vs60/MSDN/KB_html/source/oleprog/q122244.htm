<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
An update to the OLE2View sample application is available in the Microsoft
Software Library (MSL) as a self-extracting file named OLE2V.EXE. This file
contains both 16- and 32-bit versions of Ole2View version 1.33.
<P>
This new release of the sample application fixes several bugs (mostly of a
cosmetic nature) found in the versions of Ole2View that shipped with Visual
C++ versions 1.5 and 2.0 and with the Win32 Software Development Kit (SDK)
for Windows NT version 3.5.

</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Files Included in OLE2V.EXE</h3>
 
<P>
OLE2VIEW.EXE  - Ole2View 1.33 (Win16)
<PRE>DEFO2V.DLL    - IDataObject and ITypeLib interface viewers (Win16)
</PRE>OLE2VW32.EXE  - Ole2View 1.33 (Win32)
DEFO2V32.DLL  - IDataObject and ITypeLib interface viewers (Win32)
OLE2VIEW.HLP  - Helpfile
<PRE>OLE2V20.EXE   - Ole2view BETA 2.0 (Win32)
</PRE>IViewers.DLL  - Interface views for Ole2view 2.0 (Win32)
<PRE>MFC40.DLL     - MFC 4.0 DLL
MSCRT40.DLL   - Run time for Ole2view 2.0

</PRE><h3>Version 1.33 Changes</h3>
 
<P>
- The 32-bit version is 100 percent compatible with Windows 95 in terms of
<PRE>  using the right colors, and so on.

</PRE>- A bug in the Japanese version of Windows (display of spurious characters)
<PRE>  is fixed.

</PRE>- DEFO2V32.DLL is changed to include only the ANSI versions of the
<PRE>  interface viewers. Now DispplayIDataObjectA, DispplayIDispatchA,
  DispplayITypeInfoA, and DispplayITypeLibA are gone. DispplayIDataObject,
  DispplayIDispatch, DispplayITypeInfo, and DispplayITypeLib are now ANSI;
  they used to be Unicode. This change was made to simplify debugging
  DEFO2V and because the Unicode versions were never called.

</PRE><h3>Version 2.0 BETA Changes</h3>
 
<P>
-  Requires MFC40 DLLs. The necessary ones are included if you do not have
<PRE>   them.

</PRE>-  Requires either Windows NT version 3.51 or above, or Windows 95.
<P>
-  Better categorization/organization of various object types. Much easier
<PRE>   to find the object you're looking for. (Still no find command though.)

</PRE>-  Interface viewers are now COM objects.  Viewers for IDataObject,
<PRE>   IDispatch, ITypeLib, and ITypeInfo are provided. You can    write your
   own.

   A default interface  viewer for IUnknown is included, so that no matter
   what interface you click on,  you'll at least get the default.

</PRE>-  The IDataObject viewer (call the the Uniform Data Transfer viewer) is
<PRE>   still under construction. It's not nearly as functional as the original
   (yet).

-  The ITypeLib viewer is very good. A    typelib decompiler was written.
   The output window of the typelib viewer shows   the .ODL source for the
   given typelib (or the part you have selected).

-  The registry view (right side) now shows *all* the relevant    registry
   information, including named values of keys like   "ApartmentModel".

</PRE>-  Context menus (right mouse buttons work).
<P>
-  Multiple objects can be activated simultaneously (bold items are
<PRE>   currently active).

</PRE>-  Drag &amp; Drop (WM_DROPFILES and OLE) works. Drop a file name on Ole2View
<PRE>   and a file moniker is created and bound to it.

</PRE>-  Drag &amp; Drop, and the drag &amp; drop object is put in the list.
