<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
To understand how an OLE application should handle an OLE scenario, you may
find it helpful to examine an existing application that handles that
scenario correctly.
<P>
The OUTLINE series of OLE sample applications can provide a log of debug
output. This log shows all of the OLE calls that the OUTLINE application
handles and the OLE calls that it makes. Examining this log is a useful OLE
problem-solving tool, and an excellent way to learn about OLE programming.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The OUTLINE series consists of four different applications: CNTROUTL (OLE
container), SVROUTL (OLE server), ICNTROTL (in-place editing-capable
OLE container), and ISVROTL (in-place editing-capable OLE server). The
OUTLINE series is included as sample code with the OLE SDK and with the
Win32 SDK.
<P>
Each of the four OUTLINE applications implements a Debug Level dialog
box. The following table show the debugging information produced by each
debug level value:
<P>
<P>
<PRE>Debug Level   Debugging Information Produced
</PRE> 
<PRE>   0          No debug messages (default).
   1          Print message when a Document or Application is destroyed.
   2          Trace every OLE API and method call.
   3          Give a more OUTLINE app specific context to the OLE calls.
   4          Track all memory reference counts (AddRef/Release).

</PRE>The debug output forms a log of all the incoming and outgoing OLE method
calls that OUTLINE handles. Use the DBWIN tool to capture and display this
output. Note that although there are both 16-bit and 32-bit versions of
the OUTLINE samples, DBWIN can currently only be used to capture output
from the 16-bit samples.
<P>
<P><h3>Benefits to Examining the Watch Log</h3>
 
<P>
The first benefit to examining the watch log produced by one of the
OUTLINE samples is that it shows the series of calls that an OLE
application needs to make in order to handle a given OLE scenario. For
example, to see what calls an OLE container application needs to make when
transitioning an embedded object from the loaded to the running state,
double-click an object embedded into a CNTROUTL document to run that
object; then examine the log that CNTROUTL produces.
<P>
The next benefit arises from the fact that the source code to the OUTLINE
samples is included with Microsoft Visual C++. The watch log shows you
the key calls that OUTLINE makes to handle some particular scenario.
Using a GREP utility, you can search the OUTLINE source code for those
calls, and then examine that code. The OUTLINE source code is a very
thorough implementation of OLE functionality.
<P>
In addition, you can run the OUTLINE application under a debugger, setting
break points before the key calls, and then stepping through that code.
<P>
Finally, the OUTLINE source code contains many source code comments labeled
"OLE2NOTE." These comments contain in-depth discussions of some of the
more detailed aspects of OLE programming.
