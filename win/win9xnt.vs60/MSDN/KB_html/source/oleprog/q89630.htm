The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft OLE version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
The Windows 3.1 SDK's "Programmer's Reference: Volume 1" does not
mention what the size limits for OLE item names, file names for linked
OLE objects, and OLE class names. The maximum sizes of these
components are listed below:
<P>
<PRE>   OLE class name:         64 characters
   OLE linked filename:    Less than 98 characters (see note below)
   OLE item name:          115 characters

</PRE>The OLE class name identifies your OLE class in the registration
database, and is the first component of the ObjectLink and OwnerLink
clipboard formats. The size of this name is limited by the maximum
string that the registration database can hold, which is 64
characters.
<P>
The OLE linked filename is used when specifying a linked object, and
is the second component in the ObjectLink and OwnerLink clipboard
formats. Within the OLE libraries, this name is limited to 123
characters, but the actual limit is much smaller. Since a linked
filename can be passed to the server application on the command line,
the size of this name is limited by both the size of the server
executable path (which typically varies for each server) and the size
of the MS-DOS command line (which is 128 characters).
<P>
For example, assuming the server application is entered in the
registration database as "C:\WINAPPS\WINWORD\WORDART\WORDART.EXE" (38
characters), the command line that the OLE libraries would use to open
a linked object is:
<P>
C:\WINAPPS\WINWORD\WORDART\WORDART.EXE /Embedding &lt;Linked File&gt;
<P>
In this case, the maximum size of the linked filename "&lt;Linked File&gt;"
is 78 characters (128 limit - 38 chars for server - 12 chars for the
string " -Embedding ").
<P>
Due to the variable length of server path names, it is difficult to
predict what the maximum allowable size for the linked filename is,
but a safe maximum is about 50 characters.
<P>
Another method of determining the maximum size of the linked filename
is to query the registration database to get the size of your server
executable's path. Then you can use this information to determine the
maximum linked filename length, and notify the user if they are
exceeding this length.
<P>
The third component of the ObjectLink and OwnerLink clipboard formats
is the OLE item name. This name cannot be longer than 115 characters.
Due to a bug in the OLE libraries, exceeding this 115 character limit
may cause your stack to be overwritten, so your application should
manually verify that this string does not exceed 115 characters.
