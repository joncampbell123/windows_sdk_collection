<UL><LI>Microsoft OLE Libraries for Windows and Win32s, version 2.03

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
A synchronous OLE call made by the recipient of an inter-process/inter-
thread SendMessage fails with RPC_E_CANTCALLOUT_ININPUTSYNCCALL.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The cause is discussed in detail in the "More Information" section of this
article.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Use PostMessage instead of an inter-process/inter-thread SendMessage.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
See the beginning of chapter 13 in the OLE 2 Programmer's Reference Volume
1 for the categories of OLE calls. An understanding of these categories is
required for this article.
<P>
The majority of OLE calls are synchronous calls. A synchronous call to a
different process yields to that process and waits for a reply from that
process. In addition, OLE has input-synchronized calls that relate to the
inplace-activation interfaces. Input-synchronized calls are implemented
using an inter-process/inter-thread SendMessage.
<P>
16-bit Windows doesn't allow a task to yield while in an inter-
process/inter-thread SendMessage because a system deadlock could occur. The
deadlock occurs because a message for the sender could be present at the
top of the shared system queue, and this prevents other tasks, including
the recipient of the SendMessage, from retrieving their messages from the
system queue until the sender does. The sender cannot retrieve its message
because it is waiting for the inter-process/inter-thread SendMessage to
return.
<P>
In 32-bit Windows, each process has its own system queue and this
architecture normally prevents deadlock problem from occurring. However,
when one process is inplace active in another process's window, the system
queues of the two processes are synchronized as in 16-bit windows, so the
deadlock could occur. To prevent this, OLE stops synchronous OLE calls from
being made while the caller is the recipient of an input-synchronized call.
<P>
OLE determines if the caller of the synchronous call is a recipient of
an input-synchronized call by using the InSendMessage() API. This broad
check prevents a synchronous call from being made if the caller is
currently a recipient of any inter-process/inter-thread SendMessage.
