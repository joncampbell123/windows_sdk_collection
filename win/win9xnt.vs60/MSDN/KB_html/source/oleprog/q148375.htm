The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft OLE libraries included with Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When an application is launched by OLE in response to CoCreateInstance or
OleCreate, its environment block will not contain the application-specific
paths that it may have registered using the AppPaths registry entry.
Consequently when the application is loaded by OLE, it will not be able to
load any DLLs in these paths unless these paths are also part of the system
path.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
An application can specify application specific paths by using the AppPaths
registry entry in Windows 95. An application typically uses AppPaths to
specify the location of shared DLLs. OLE uses CreateProcess to launch an
application without setting the lpEnvironment parameter to an environment
block that contains the application specific path. Therefore when the
application is launched by OLE, it is prevented from finding the shared
DLLs if the paths to those DLLs are specified in AppPaths. The shell
launches applications using ShellExecute, which calls CreateProcess after
setting the environment block for the application using AppPaths.
Consequently, the application will be able to find the DLLs when it is
lauched by the shell.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Put the shared DLLs in a directory that is in the system path.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed
at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will
post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
