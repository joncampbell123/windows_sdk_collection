The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Pbject Linking and Embedding (OLE) Libraries for Windows,
   version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
Only in rare cases should an application need to use both the Object
Linking and Embedding (OLE) libraries and the Dynamic Data Exchange
Management Library (DDEML). Generally, these are cases where an
application needs OLE to support persistent embedding and linking of
objects and the other features uniquely offered by OLE, but where the
application also needs DDE to support many simultaneous links for
items that are updated very frequently.
<P>
There are no complications when both the OLE libraries and the DDEML
are used simultaneously in a client application. Simply use the OLE
libraries to initiate conversations with OLE servers; and use the
DDEML to initiate conversations with DDE servers.
<P>
However, there is one complication when using both the OLE libraries
and the DDEML in a server application. Different service names (DDE
"application" names) must be used for OLE and DDE conversations. For
example, "myapp" might be assigned as the service name for DDE
conversations, while "myappOLE" might be assigned as the service name
for OLE conversations. This is required because the OLE libraries and
the DDEML have no other way to distinguish which one should respond on
behalf of the registered server when an initiation request is
received.
<P>
It probably makes more sense to modify the service name for OLE
conversations than to modify the service name for DDE conversations.
The SHELL.DLL registration services hide the service name for the OLE
conversations from other applications and end-users. On the contrary,
other applications and end-users must have knowledge of the service
name for the DDE conversation.
