The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft OLE Libraries 4.0 included with:
   - Microsoft Win32 Software Development Kit (SDK)
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
On Windows 95 computers that have enabled remote connections to COM servers
running on the computer, remote connection attempts to the machine fail
with error RPC_SERVER_UNAVAILABLE if the only registered class objects are
from single-threaded apartments.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The problem occurs because RPCSS.EXE(A system component) is not launched at
the appropriate time.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
You can work around this problem by pre-launching Rpcss.exe before any
class objects are registered. A convenient place to do this is in the
registry at HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run (launches
when the shell loads) or \RunServices (launches immediately upon machine
boot, that is, before login). Add a named value (any name) and a value of
"RPCSS.EXE".
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed
at the beginning of this article. We are researching this bug and will post
new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Rpcss.exe is not needed for local communication between COM objects, thus
COM delays loading it until it is truly necessary. COM is able to launch
Rpcss.exe correctly if:

<UL><LI>The server is launched locally by COM.
<LI>The server is started manually but the first class registration is from
   a multi-threaded apartment (MTA, aka "free-threaded") server.
<LI>The server is launched manually, but the class object is registered in a
   suspended state (calling CoRegisterClassObject() with REGCLS_SUSPENDED
   flag).
<P>
</UL>However, Rpcss.exe is not launched reliably when a manually-started single-
threaded apartment (STA) server is the first caller of
CoRegisterClassObject.
<P>
Note that in server scenarios, COM only launches RPCSS if
EnableRemoteConnection is set to Y.
<P>
There are other reasons a client application may not be able to communicate
with a remote object:

<UL><LI>DCOM is not enabled on either the client or server machine.
<LI>On Windows 95 server machines, remote connections have not been enabled.
<LI>On Windows 95 server machines, the server application has not been
   manually launched.
<LI>The client does not have appropriate permissions to communicate with the
   server.
<P>
</UL>You can determine whether an observed failure is caused by failure to
launch Rpcss.exe by either checking whether the RPCSS process is running or
manually starting Rpcss.exe before launching the server process.
