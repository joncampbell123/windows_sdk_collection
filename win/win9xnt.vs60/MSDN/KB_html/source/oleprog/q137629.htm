<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Single threaded inproc objects (not marked with a ThreadingModel value),
must provide marshaling code for any custom interfaces that they may
implement.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
An OLE inproc object that is not marked with the ThreadingModel value
in the system registry is considered single threaded.
<P>
When an apartment model threaded client creates instances of this inproc
object in its different threads, OLE cannot load the objects into those
threads. This is because the object is single threaded and is not
designed for multithreaded access by a client. Instead, OLE will
instantiate the object in the main apartment (thread) of the client.
(The main apartment is the thread that first called Co/OleIntialize.)
The object will be marshaled to the other threads of the client that
require use of it. This marshaling requires the inproc object to provide
marshaling code for any custom interfaces it may implement. (The MIDL
compiler can be used to generate marshaling code.)
<P>
If this inproc object doesn't provide marshaling code for its custom
interfaces, it can be used only by single threaded clients or by clients
that use the object only from the main apartment.
<P>
An object that is marked ThreadingModel=Apartment or ThreadingModel=Both
is apartment model-aware. When an apartment model threaded client
creates instances of this inproc object in its different threads, each
instance will be instantiated in the respective apartments. Consequently
the object need not provide marshaling code for any custom interfaces
that it may implement.
