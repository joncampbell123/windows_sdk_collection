   3.0 and 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Under the enhanced mode Windows environment, it is sometimes necessary or
desirable to provide means by which processes (virtual machines) can
communicate with virtual devices (VxDs). This article discusses the
techniques by which this can be achieved.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Virtual machines (VMs) can communicate with virtual devices either
explicitly (which means that the virtual machine is aware of running under
control of enhanced mode Windows and submits explicit calls to the VxD) or
implicitly (which means that the VxD traps VM requests to the operating
system that would otherwise be serviced by the BIOS, TSRs, or the hardware
directly). The latter notion is basically a subset of the idea of
"virtualization," which means leaving the process under the impression that
it runs on a dedicated machine instead of under a multitasking operating
system.
<P>
When VM software wants to call into a VxD explicitly, it must first use the
Interrupt 2fh call "get device api entry point" (ax=1684h) to receive the
callback address to which the call into the VxD must be submitted. The
functionality of the VxD when processing this call is up to the VxD; the
software running in the virtual machine must know both the OEM VxD ID
number that belongs to the VxD and the functionality of the VxD API
function to utilize it. Because the VxD runs under a different protection
level and in 32-bit code segments instead of 16-bit code segments, a VM
cannot directly call into the VxD. The necessary ring transitions and mode
switches are performed by the VMM.
<P>
Because VxDs may also hook software interrupts that are being submitted by
a VM (as outlined below), a software interrupt may also be seen as a valid
method for a VM to explicitly call into a VxD; however, prior to submitting
the software interrupt, the VM should make sure that the VxD is installed,
which is possible through the "get device api entry point" call mentioned
above. If the software interrupt interface provided by the VxD includes an
installation check call (such as the VDS implementation provided by a
Windows virtual device), there is no need for an explicit VxD installation
check. Note that VDS stands for "Virtual DMA Interface Specification,"
which is a software interface for virtual machines to access physical DMA
(direct memory access). The specification is available in the Software/Data
Library; just query for VDS.
<P>
The ways a VxD can cause a VM to trap into it implicitly are the following:

<UL><LI>By hooking software interrupts that will be submitted by the VM
<LI>By trapping accesses from VMs to ports
<LI>By inserting callback addresses in the VMs address space
<P>
</UL>When a VxD wants to hook a software interrupt, it can do so by one of the
following techniques:

<OL><P><LI>Use Hook_V86_Int_Chain to register a callback function that is being
   called whenever a VM running in V86 mode submits the software interrupt

<P><LI>Use Get/Set V86_Int_Vector or Get/Set PM_Int_Vector to change the
   interrupt tables of the virtual machines
<P>
</OL>The differences between these strategies are as follows:

<UL><LI>Interrupt hooks established via Hook_V86_Int_Chain are not called by
   virtual machines running in protected mode unless the last handler in
   the VM protected-mode interrupt chain reflects the interrupt to V86
   mode.

<LI>Get/Set V86/PM_Int_Vector behaves just as if any real/protected mode
   software running in the VM had used the interrupt vectors; all code and
   data that will be touched by the interrupt handler must be visible to
   the VM in the corresponding modes and reside in 16-bit segments (unless
   it is being sent to a callback); the modified vectors can be manipulated
   (that is, looked at, chained to, replaced, and so forth) by the VM.

<LI>The calling software in the VM will never be aware of a VxD V86 hook.
   That is, the hook chain can never be accessed or manipulated by a VM;
   the interrupt handler resides in a VxD (that is, in a 32-bit segment on
   ring 0). V86 hooks are generally used to virtualize software interrupt
   interfaces within VMs (such as providing the VDS or virtual NetBIOS
   interfaces to VMs).

<LI>V86 hooks cannot be installed on a per-VM basis, whereas PM and V86-mode
   interrupt handlers can be.

<LI>Scenario 2 is very rarely used because it requires that the VxD must
   provide code and data in an environment which is not easily accessible
   to it; in effect, by doing so it would extend the VM with software
   running in the VMs execution mode, whereas the technique outlined in
   scenario 1 contains code and data which is directly accessible to the
   VxD.
<P>
</UL>By trapping port accesses from VMs, a VxD can simulate a hardware device to
a VM; whenever the VM accesses the port, the VxD-supplied callback function
will gain control and leave the VM under the impression that a hardware
device had serviced the port access. Although the main purpose of this
mechanism is to virtualize hardware, it can be used to communicate
information from a VxD to a VM. This technique is used in VITD, a virtual
timer device that is supplied in the Software/Data Library (query on VITD
or S12887).
<P>
To use port trapping for communication, a VxD calls one of the services,
Install_IO_Handler or Install_Mult_IO_Handler.
<P>
A callback, eventually, is an address within the visible range of a VM that
will transfer control to a routine supplied in a VxD when being jumped to
while the VM is running in its current mode. Callback functions can be
combined with interrupt vectors in that an interrupt vector in a VM can be
set to a callback function. Note, however, that for VMs running in V86
mode, hooking the interrupt is generally more efficient than setting the
V86-mode interrupt vector to a callback because two ring transitions less
are needed.
<P>
To allocate a callback, a VxD can call the service Allocate_V86_Call_back
service for VMs running in V86 mode and Allocate_PM_Call_Back for VMs
running in protected mode.
<P>
<P><h3>Calling VM Code from a VxD</h3>
 
<P>
When a VxD wants to transfer control to code residing in a VM, it will
generally do this by scheduling an event for the VM that simulates a far
call or an interrupt into the VM. Depending on whether the event has been
scheduled using the CallxxxEvent or the SchedulexxxEvent service, and which
VM was currently running when the event was scheduled, the call may or may
not be executed immediately. In any case, a ring transition will occur that
will execute the VM code in a less privileged level in 16-bit mode.
<P>
If a VxD wants to call software in a VM directly without scheduling an
event, it should do so by using the Begin_Nest_Exec and End_Nest_Exec
services. Because this mechanism uses the current virtual machine only, a
VxD should use it primarily with global TSRs because global TSRs are
guaranteed to be shared by all VMs; if a VxD wants to use nested execution
to call code that is local to one VM, it must make sure to do this only if
the VM hosting the code to call into is the current VM.
<P>
Nested calls and scheduled events can be used cooperatively. In particular,
due to the non-reentrancy of the Windows enhanced mode operating system,
certain routines (such as interrupt handlers) will need to schedule events
that will eventually submit a nested execution call into a VM.
<P>
Note that the Exec_VxD_Int service should not be used to communicate
information from a VxD to a VM. This service is basically provided to allow
VxDs to use extended MS-DOS services. When Exec_VxD_Int is being called,
the current virtual machine will be forced into protected mode regardless
of the mode it ran under, and the system protected-mode interrupt handler
chain is called (note that the current VM's protected-mode interrupt chain
does not see the interrupt).
