<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
On July 1, 1992, the Windows Display Driver Testing Program was transferred
from Microsoft's Systems Division to Microsoft Compatibility Labs (MCL) in
Microsoft Technical Support (MTS).
<P>
The U.S. Printer Driver Testing Program was transferred from the Windows
Printing Group to MCL in April 1992. (European printer driver testing
remains under the International Products Group [IPG]).
<P>
The transfer of these programs to MCL has resulted in some changes in the
administration of the program.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Important Changes</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>All products certified by MCL are eligible to use the "Windows
   Certified" logo. Previously, there was no logo associated with the
   display and printer driver testing programs.

<P><LI>The display testing program is now fee-based (it was free before).
   Printer testing has always been fee-based.

<P><LI>Display vendors should contact MCL, not the Microsoft Hardware
   Vendor Relations Group, for program participation information. MCL
   is now the primary contact for the display driver testing program.

<P><LI>A testing agreement must be worked out with MCL before a driver can
   be submitted for testing. (A contract has always been needed prior
   to printer driver testing, but this is new for display testing.)
   Display driver developers should not send in their packages without
   contacting MCL first.

<P><LI>Some procedural changes have been made that affect what an
   independent hardware vendor (IHV) needs to submit to Microsoft. See
   below for instructions on how to obtain this detailed information.
<P>
</OL><h3>Important Items That Have Not Changed</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Printer and display drivers that pass testing by MCL will be
   included on the Windows Driver Library (WDL). The list of devices
   supported by the WDL (the "WDL Supported Devices List") is
   published in the Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1
   retail package.

<P><LI>MCL will use the printer and display driver tests that are shipped
   with the Windows 3.1 Device Development Kit (DDK). MCL may add
   additional "optional" tests and correct minor problems with the
   existing tests.
<P>
</OL><h3>Contacting MCL</h3>
 
<P>
Display and printer driver developers should contact MCL with questions on
how to submit drivers for testing. MCL will also provide IHVs with status
information on drivers that are in the testing process. All developers
should contact MCL to set up a testing agreement PRIOR to submitting their
driver packages to Microsoft. For more information, call, write, or fax MCL
