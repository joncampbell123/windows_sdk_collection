</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The privilege level at which applications and dynamic-link libraries (DLLs)
run has changed from ring 1 in versions of Microsoft Windows prior to
Windows 3.1 to ring 3 in Windows 3.1. This change makes Windows more
consistent with the protection scheme used in other operating systems, and
enables future versions of Windows to take better advantage of the page
protection mechanism of the 386 processor.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The architecture of the 386 processor defines four privilege levels to
protect system code and data from being overwritten inadvertently or
maliciously by code of lesser privilege. The processor's current privilege
level (CPL) is contained in the low-order two bits of the selector in the
CS register. The privilege level of 0 (zero) is the most privileged; the
privilege level of 3 is the least privileged. When code is running at a
given privilege level, it is said to be running in that "ring" [for
example, code running at privilege level 0 (zero) is said to run in ring
0].
<P>
When Windows is running in enhanced mode, the enhanced mode layer (the
virtual machine manager and all virtual devices) runs in ring 0. Code run
in virtual-8086 (V86) mode, like MS-DOS and the BIOS, runs in ring 3. The
remaining code (applications and DLLs, including kernel, user, GDI, and all
Windows device drivers) runs in ring 1 under Windows 3.0, and in ring 3
under Windows 3.1.
<P>
In discussing the implications of this change, it is important to realize
that all of the code that was running at ring 1 has been moved to ring 3.
No distinction is made between any Windows applications and DLLs, not even
the Windows kernel DLL or device drivers. This means that there is no net
change in the privilege of this software. In other words, under both
Windows 3.0 and 3.1, there are functionally only two privilege levels in
use: ring 0 code, and everything else. The fact that both rings 1 and 3 are
used in Windows 3.0 is insignificant because the code in these rings is
generally in isolated address spaces.
<P>
Therefore, for Windows 3.1, the only real implication of the change is that
the privilege level is numerically different. If an application
specifically tests to see if it is running in ring 1 (by checking the bits
in the code selector), that test will fail under Windows 3.1. Similarly, if
an application directly modifies the local descriptor table (LDT), this
modification can create an invalid selector in Windows 3.1. Other than
that, this privilege change does not affect what applications can do.
<P>
One of the main reasons for the change is to pave the way for future
enhancements to protection in Windows. One of the 386 processor's
protection features is called page protection. This mechanism allows the
operating system to flag memory pages (4K in size) as either a "User" or a
"Supervisor" page. Code that runs at ring 0, 1, or 2 may access either user
or supervisor pages. However, code running at ring 3 cannot access
supervisor pages, and can write only to pages that are marked as
read/write. This powerful protection mechanism may be used to further
enhance protection under Windows. This feature is not implemented in
Windows 3.1.
