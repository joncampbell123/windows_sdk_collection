   and 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In the future, Microsoft Windows and applications developed for Windows are
likely to run in read-only memory (ROM). The text below lists some things
to consider during the process writing software that may be burned into
ROM. Some things are obvious, some are not, and some are specific to system
implementation.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 

<OL><P><LI>Code Segment (CS) Variables
<P>
   Do not use CS variables. Although the discipline of writing code
   for protected mode has eliminated many code segment variables,
   numerous modules use the PrestoChangoSelector function, which
   causes problems. Never allocate a CS alias unless you have a very
   good reason. Read-only tables in CS are acceptable. If each table
   is referenced only within the segment in which it is defined, the
   code can be patched to correct errors.
<P>
   If, for very serious performance reasons, a CS variable is
   required, the program must copy the entire code segment into RAM.
   Try to make the code segment as small as possible.

<P><LI>Code Patching
<P>
   Do not expect any dynamic code patching to work properly. (If an
   application replaces a device driver, this is acceptable as long as
   the device driver is built into the ROM image, or the ROM image
   device drivers are "replaceable," which may or may not be the
   case).

<P><LI>Accessing the Executable File
<P>
   Do not use the AccessResource function or otherwise open the
   program's EXE file. When a module is placed in ROM, the application
   cannot access it with MS-DOS read or write functions. Always use
   the FindResource, LoadResource and LockResource functions to access
   resources directly. There is no method to work around this
   limitation; if an application uses AccessResource to access a small
   part of a large resource, break the resources into smaller
   segments.

<P><LI>Module Paths
   Do not load a module with an explicit pathname unless you know it
   is not in ROM. The LoadModule function searches the ROM for a
   module only if the function call does not contain an explicit path.

<P><LI>WinFlags
<P>
   Import the __WinFlags variable only to check the WF_PMODE bit. In a
   ROM-based Windows implementation, this address must be part of the
   ROM image, therefore, other bits may be incorrect. Use the
   GetWinFlags function to retrieve the run time value of WinFlags.
<P>
   In general, do not import a value from a module using an absolute
   address if the value can change at run time. __WinFlags is the only
   such value in the Windows core.
