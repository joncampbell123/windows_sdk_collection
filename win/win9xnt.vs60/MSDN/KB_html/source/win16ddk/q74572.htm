The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows Device Driver Kit (DDK) for Windows versions 3.0
   and 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
For performance reasons, the Microsoft Windows graphical environment
does not use the MS-DOS mouse driver even if one is installed. Windows
has its own mouse driver (usually a file named MOUSE.DRV) that handles
mouse input. Therefore, Windows applications can use the mouse as long
as the appropriate Windows mouse driver is installed, regardless of
whether an MS-DOS mouse driver is present.
<P>
The Windows mouse driver does not provide any mouse support for MS-DOS
(non-Windows) applications. You must load the MS-DOS mouse driver to
use the mouse with an MS-DOS application running under Windows. You
can load the MS-DOS mouse driver either before running Windows or in
an MS-DOS session under Windows. However, we recommend that you load
the mouse driver before starting Windows because hardware conflicts
may occur if a mouse driver attempts to initialize the hardware after
Windows has started.
<P>
The virtual device driver named VMD manages ownership of the mouse
hardware between the Windows mouse driver and the MS-DOS mouse driver.
VMD is not a mouse driver; it simply switches hardware ownership
between the MS-DOS and Windows drivers.
