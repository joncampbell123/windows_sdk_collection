<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
A hardware interrupt in the 386 enhanced mode of the Microsoft Windows
graphical environment is classified as either "global" or "owned." A global
interrupt is typically reflected into whichever virtual machine (VM) is
currently running, while an owned interrupt is reflected into the VM that
owns that interrupt. For example, the floppy disk drive interrupt is
typically made global, because any VM should be able to use the floppy disk
drive and receive interrupts from it. On the other hand, an application
that exclusively handles communications with a nonstandard device would
become confused if interrupts from the device were routed to some other VM.
For this reason, these interrupts should be "owned."
<P>
In some circumstances, it may be advantageous to "capture" a global
interrupt temporarily in one VM, effectively making the interrupt "owned."
The text below discusses VFINTD.386, a sample virtual device (VxD) that
does just that. With this VxD installed in a Windows system running in 386
enhanced mode, an application can issue the appropriate function calls to
reflect all interrupts from the floppy disk drive into the application's
VM, regardless of which VM is currently running.
<P>
VFINTD is one of the sample applications provided with version 3.1 of
the Microsoft Windows Device Driver Kit (DDK). VFINTD can also be
found in the Microsoft Software Library.

<P>
<P><h3>Background</h3>
 
<P>
Standard hardware for an MS-DOS compatible computer includes a
programmable interrupt controller (PIC). One register in the PIC is
the interrupt mask register (IMR), which defines which hardware
interrupts are currently enabled and which are disabled (or masked).
The MS-DOS utility DEBUG can display the contents of the IMR. To
demonstrate this, run DEBUG from the MS-DOS prompt. Then enter the
following command to display the value of port 21 on your machine:
<P>
<PRE>   i21

</PRE>Port 21 is the IMR for the hardware interrupts IRQ0 through IRQ7. The
format of the IMR is that each bit (0-7) that is set corresponds to a
disabled interrupt request (IRQ). Therefore, a typical IMR value might
be 98h, which indicates that IRQ3, IRQ4, and IRQ7 are all masked, and
that those interrupts are disabled:
<P>
<PRE>   Hexadecimal 98 = Binary 10011000 = IRQ3, IRQ4, and IRQ7 off

</PRE>Note: A PC/AT compatible system has two hardware PICs, and thus, two
IMRs, that correspond to the fifteen possible IRQs. (The second PIC is
cascaded to IRQ2, which consumes one IRQ.) While this point is
included here for completeness, is not necessary to understand the
overall picture.
<P>
When an MS-DOS device driver or terminate-and-stay-resident program
(TSR) installs an interrupt handler for a particular IRQ, the device
driver or TSR hooks the interrupt vector and unmasks the corresponding
bit in the IMR. When Windows is running, MS-DOS drivers and TSRs are
normally shared by all virtual machines. Thus, if an interrupt occurs
while an arbitrary VM is running, Windows is not required to perform a
virtual machine task switch to access the interrupt handler, because
the interrupt handler resides in the address space of each virtual
machine.
<P>
Alternatively, if an interrupt handler for a previously masked IRQ is
installed within a virtual machine, and an interrupt occurs while
another virtual machine is executing, Windows must make a task switch
so that the local interrupt handler is accessible and executable.
<P>
<P><h3>Windows Default Behavior</h3>
 
<P>
The VPICD VxD virtualizes the PICs when Windows is running in 386
enhanced mode. When hardware is virtualized, each virtual machine has
access to its own "virtual" PIC. This allows transparently sharing
hardware among all virtual machines.
<P>
Unless some other mechanism processes an IRQ, the VPICD handles
interrupts according to the following default behavior:
<P>
When Windows boots into 386 enhanced mode, VPICD examines the value of
the IMRs in the system to determine which interrupts are masked. If an
interrupt is not masked (is enabled), Windows must assume that a valid
interrupt handler is already installed for this IRQ. These IRQs are
then flagged as "global," so that Windows can avoid the overhead of a
task switch to service them. The remaining IRQs, which are masked
(disabled), are flagged as "local" or "owned." An interrupt for one of
these IRQs will be reflected only into each virtual machine that
unmasks the IRQ.
<P>
<P><h3>Changing the Default Behavior</h3>
 
<P>
It is possible to change the default behavior of interrupt handling
(described above) by installing a VxD that virtualizes an IRQ with the
VxD call VPICD_Virtualize_IRQ. This call replaces the VPICD default
callback routines with routines supplied in the VxD. For example, the
virtual communication device (VCD) virtualizes the communication
interrupt so that it can control interrupts from communication devices
regardless of the state of the IMR at Windows load time.
<P>
The VFINTD sample VxD also uses VPICD_Virtualize_IRQ to allow an
application to "capture" the interrupts on IRQ6 (the floppy disk
device), which is normally global. For example, a hard disk backup
program that directly accesses the floppy disk controller hardware to
improve performance would "lose" interrupts to other virtual machines
unless it changed the global nature of IRQ6. VFINTD can be used in
this case to capture the "focus" of the floppy disk device and the
interrupts it generates.
<P>
<P><h3>Using VFINTD</h3>
 
<P>
There are two pieces of code to the VFINTD sample: the VxD and a
sample MS-DOS application. All the files that are named VFINTD are
part of the VxD. The MS-DOS application is called TSTFINT. The only
purpose of the MS-DOS application is to capture floppy disk
interrupts. The sample application does not release the focus capture,
but the VxD provides this functionality.
<P>
To install the VxD in your machine, perform the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Exit from Windows.

<P><LI>Modify the [386enh] section of your SYSTEM.INI file to include the
   following line:
<P>
<P><PRE>      device=VFINTD.386
</PRE>
<P><LI>Copy the VFINTD.386 file into the directory where the Windows
   system files are stored. By default, this is the C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM
   directory.

<P><LI>Start Windows.
<P>
</OL>With the VxD installed, you can run the TSTFINT application in an
MS-DOS window to capture interrupts from the floppy drive. TSTFINT
displays the version number of the VxD to indicate that the
application has successfully communicated with the VxD.
<P>
This sample has been provided to demonstrate how to virtualize a
particular IRQ. It is a good place to start when developing another
VxD to perform a similar function.
