<P>
Call_Priority_VM_Event is one of the most valuable virtual device (VxD)
calls available. When an application is at a point where the state of the
system keeps the VxD from completing, a call to Call_Priority_VM_Event
causes the process to yield until the system is in such a state that the
VxD can continue.
<P>
Under most circumstances, using this function will cause events to be
processed in a specific manner. Note, however, that any number of events
can occur between the call to Call_Priority_VM_Event and the call to the
event handler specified as a parameter in the Call_Priority_VM_Event call.
<P>
If a VxD intermittently has problems, they may be caused by the code
assuming that the handler is called before certain other actions occur.
Also note that a VxD may be re-entered before the handler is called,
causing another call to Call_Priority_VM_Event before the first handler is
called.
<P>
If two or more handlers are set up at once, they will usually be called in
last-in, first-out (LIFO) order; however, this is not guaranteed. If
Call_Priority_VM_Event is used, VxD code must be written to be completely
re-entrant and it must allow the handlers to be called in any order.
