The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows Device Development Kit (DDK) for Windows version
   3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When COM1 and another communications (COM) port are active and share the
same IRQ using the Windows 3.1 COMM.DRV, the system hangs or reboots.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When two or more COM ports share an IRQ, COMM.DRV creates a linked list of
these ports using the NextDEB field of the ComDEB structure that the
COMM.DRV maintains for each port. When an interrupt occurs that has been
hooked by COMM.DRV, the COMM.DRV interrupt handler walks the list of COM
ports that are sharing the IRQ. For each port in the list, the COMM.DRV
interrupt handler checks for and services any interrupts that are pending
from the port. The COMM.DRV interrupt handler knows when it has reached the
end of the list of ports that are sharing an IRQ when it reaches a ComDEB
structure in which the NextDEB field is zero.
<P>
If another port is sharing an IRQ with COM1 and it is opened after COM1,
the NextDEB field in the ComDEB structure for the other port will point to
the ComDEB structure for COM1. However, in the COMM.DRV included with
Windows 3.1, the offset to COM1's ComDEB structure happens to be zero. The
list of COM ports sharing an IRQ with COM1 will appear to end with the port
on the list before COM1. This will cause the COMM.DRV interrupt handler to
skip the interrupt servicing for COM1, and its interrupt will never be
cleared. If the interrupt is level-triggered and it is not cleared, the
COMM.DRV interrupt handler will be immediately called again as soon as
interrupts are reenabled. This will cause the machine to hang or reboot.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
The following are resolutions:

<UL><LI>Don't share an IRQ with COM1.

<LI>Modify COMM.DRV as described below by adding a dummy variable before
  space is allocated for the ComDEB structures in IBMSETUP.ASM. This will
  ensure that the offset of the ComDEB structure for COM1 is not zero.
<P>
   Fragment from the DDK \286\COMM directory, source file IBMSETUP.ASM:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ;;; Add the line below, approximately line 142
<PRE></PRE>      Dummy   dw      0         ; make sure offset of COM1 is not 0!

      ??portnum = 1
      REPT MAXCOM+1
              DefineCommX %??portnum
      ??portnum = ??portnum+1
      ENDM

</PRE></UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This bug is fixed in version 3.11 of Windows for Workgroups.
