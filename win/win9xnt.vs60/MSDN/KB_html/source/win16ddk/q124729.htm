The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows Device Driver Development Kit (DDK) for Windows
   version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The process for performing DMA transfers in the protected mode Windows
environment should be similiar to the process for performing DMA transfers
in the real mode MS-DOS environment. In both environments, you must
initialize the DMA controller with the starting base address, page address,
transfer count, and mode. In both environments, you would usually install a
hardware interrupt handler to handle terminal count interrupts when a DMA
transfer is complete.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The main difference, relevant to DMA transfers, between the real mode
MS-DOS environment and the protected mode Windows environment is that with
the use of 80386 virtual memory features, a linear address may be mapped to
an arbitrary physical address. In addition, a contiguous linear address
region that spans page boundaries may be mapped to physical pages that are
not physically contiguous. Because the DMA controller bypasses the 80386
page tables and works directly with physical addresses, the DMA controller
must be programmed with physical address and the DMA transfer buffer must
be physically contiguous.
<P>
In enhanced mode Windows, the Virtual DMA Device (VDMAD) attempts to hide
the virtual memory issues from device drivers that are not fully aware of
the virtual memory environment. The main purpose of VDMAD is to convert
linear addresses virtually programmed into the DMA controller into physical
addresses. This is necessary because Windows applications and DLLs that are
not fully aware of the virtual memory environmentonly deal with linear
addresses, but the DMA controller only deals with physical addresses.
<P>
VDMAD virtualizes the DMA controller by trapping all port I/O access to the
controller. Windows-based applications and DLLs do not have direct access
to the DMA controller through port I/O. They only directly affect the VMDAD
maintained virtual state of the DMA controller. The virtual state for each
channel includes the mode, base address, and transfer count. When a DMA
channel is virtually unmasked, VDMAD physically programs the DMA controller
with appropriate values based on the channels virtual state.
<P>
If the DMA region specified by the virtual base address and transfer count
maps to physical memory that is physically contiguous and does not cross a
64K boundary on byte channels or a 128K boundary on word channels, the
VDMAD will physically program the DMA controller with the physical base.
<P>
If the DMA buffer is not physically contiguous, or crosses a 64K or 128K
boundary, VDMAD double buffers the DMA tranfer using a physically
contiguous DMA buffer that it allocated during its initialization. The
default size of this buffer is 16K. It can be increased by using SYSTEM.INI
[386Enh] DMABUFFERSIZE=. If the DMA buffer is not physically contiguous and
it is larger than the size of the VDMAD buffer, VDMAD will terminate the VM
(Virtual Machine) and display this message:
<P>
<PRE>    "The DMA buffer is too small.  Set DMABUFFERSIZE=xxx
    in SYSTEM.INI in the [386Enh] section and restart
    your computer."

</PRE>The Windows 3.1 version of VDMAD does support AutoInit DMA transfers. The
major restriction VDMAD places on AutoInit DMA transfers is that the DMA
buffer must be physically contiguous. Unless a DMA buffer is allocated by a
VxD, a Windows-based application or DLL should not attempt AutoInit
transfers using a buffer larger than 4Kb. If you need a DMA buffer larger
than 4K that is guaranteed to be physically contiguous, you can use
_PageAllocate during the initialization of a VxD.
<P>
GlobalDosAlloc() does not guarantee anything about the physical memory
properties of the memory it allocates. In particular, the memory may not be
physically contiguous, and it may be physically located above one megabyte.
However, it does guarantee that the linear address of memory is below one
megabyte. What this means in relation to not needing to use VDS is that the
linear address can be programmed into a virtual 24-bit DMA controller, and
then VDMAD can transparently take care of converting the linear address to
a physical address.
<P>
Memory returned by GlobalDosAlloc() is already fixed and page locked so
neither GlobalFix() nor GlobalPageLock() are necessary.
<P>
In enhanced mode Windows, GlobalAlloc() can allocate memory with a linear
address above 16 megabytes. In particular, the address should be above two
gigabytes if it is not below one megabyte. A linear address above 16
megabytes cannot be programmed into a virtual 24-bit DMA controller. You
can use the VDS function Lock DMA Region to convert the linear address to a
physical address. Then use the VDS function Disable Address Translation to
disable the normal linear-&gt;physical address translation. Then program the
DMA controller with the physical address of the buffer instead of the
linear address.
<P>
The VDS function Lock DMA Region will page lock a linear address region,
but it has no knowledge of Kernel's global heap. If the memory moves in
Kernel's global heap, the linear address of the memory will change and it
will no longer map to the same physical pages. A DMA buffer allocated using
GlobalAlloc() should be allocated with the flags GMEM_FIXED by a DLL, or if
allocated by an application GlobalFix() or GlobalPageLock() should be used
to keep the memory from moving in the linear address space.
<P>
In summary, if AutoInit transfers are not used, a DMA buffer can be
allocated using GlobalDosAlloc(), in which case the use of VDS should not
be necessary, or a DMA buffer can be allocated using GlobalAlloc()
(GMEM_FIXED in a DLL, or also use GlobalPageLock() in an application), in
which case the use of VDS is necessary. If AutoInit transfers are used, and
the buffer size must be larger than 4K, then the DMA buffer must be
allocated using _PageAllocate in the initialization of a VxD, and VDS must
be used to disable address translation.
