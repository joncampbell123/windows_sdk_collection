</PRE>This application note contains the most current information available
on the Microsoft Display Driver Testing Program.
<P>
Any time you consider submitting a display driver to Microsoft for
testing, you should obtain the current version of this application
note for information on any changes in procedures or tests that may
impact testing and submitting your driver.
<P>
The disk that accompanies this application note contains the following
files:
<P>
<PRE>DCT.DOC     The current revision of the DCT.DOC file distributed with
            version 3.1 of the Microsoft Windows Device Driver Kit
            (DDK). This file provides overview information about the
            display driver testing program and the most current list
            of optional display driver tests. The testers at
            Microsoft can run any of the optional tests during the
            driver evaluation process. The driver fails the testing
            program if it fails any of the tests, including the
            optional tests. We encourage you to run all of the
            optional tests on your driver prior to submitting it to
            Microsoft for testing.

            A revision log at the beginning of the document
            highlights changes for each revision of the document
            since its original creation.

</PRE>DCTPROC.DOC The documentation for the display driver testing program
<PRE>            and a list of participation details.

</PRE>DIBVIEW.EXE An updated version of the DIBVIEW application provided
<PRE>            with the DIBVIEW test application provided with the DDK.
            This version corrects a problem that produces a general
            protection (GP) fault if the user presses a key while the
            program displays a device-independent bitmap (DIB).

ACTSL.DOC   A test document. The version of ACTSL.DOC provided with
            the Windows 3.1 DDK contains a section that is
            incorrectly formatted with the "Symbol PS" font instead
            of the "Symbol" font. The Windows graphics device
            interface (GDI) correctly maps this section to the
            "Wingdings" font instead of the "Symbol" font. This
            version of ACTSL.DOC is formatted correctly.

</PRE><h3>New Optional Tests</h3>
 
<P>
This application note includes the HANG.EXE and RAMPS.EXE files, new
optional tests that have been added to the display driver testing
program. These programs are documented in the "Optional Tests" section
of DCT.DOC.
