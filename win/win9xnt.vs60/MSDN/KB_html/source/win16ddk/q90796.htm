<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows Device Driver Kit (DDK) for Windows version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In the enhanced mode Windows environment, both TSRs (terminate-and-stay-
resident programs) and VxDs (virtual device drivers) can ask the operating
system for areas of instanced data in the V86-mode addressable virtual
memory range. This article describes the algorithm that the VMM (virtual
memory manager) employs to determine the memory layout as well as some
implications arising from that approach.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Because the smallest unit of memory for which the Intel i386+ processor
provides support to the operating system is 4K and the total addressable
range in V86 mode is 0 - FFFF:F (including the virtual high memory area),
the memory range of each virtual machine is associated with 0x10F pages
that the VMM can maintain. Each of these pages is associated with a number
of flags; the following are relevant for this discussion:

<UL><LI>global (PG_SYS); meaning that this page is being mapped onto the same
   physical page in every virtual machine; thus, changing the contents of
   that page in one VM will affect the corresponding page in all VMs. By
   default, all TSRs that were active before enhanced mode Windows started
   up are considered global, as well as the images of the BIOS and MS-DOS
   system code.

<LI>local (PG_VM); meaning that that page is maintained in the context of
   that VM only. Changes in these pages in one VM do not affect other VMs
   unless the mapping has been changed by a VxD.

<LI>instanced (PG_INSTANCE); meaning data that is generally being operated
   on by code in global pages but needs to have local instances in each VM.
   For example, MS-DOS keeps a variable in which it stores the current
   working directory. Although the code that works on this variable is
   global, the data itself is local so that each VM can operate in the
   context of a different current working directory.
<P>
</UL>Because TSR code is not generally designed to be aligned on 4K boundaries,
each page labeled PG_INSTANCE typically contains a mixture of instanced and
global data. Windows requires that all instanced data be identified at
system initialization time; once this task is completed, Windows sets up a
data structure that contains the locations of instance data areas
PG_INSTANCE marked pages. The contents of the instanced data structures
present at Windows startup time will be saved into a snapshot buffer and
restored from that buffer at Windows termination time.
<P>
Each VM will then be associated with an instance buffer that will initially
contain a copy of the data in the snapshot buffer. Using a copy-on-write
scheme that is supported by the faulting mechanism provided by the
hardware, Windows updates a VM's instance buffer once write access has been
detected to a PG_INSTANCE page (note that this is absolutely unrelated to
the paging mechanism, although page faults are involved to implement this
technique). Because only parts of an instance page are being updated,
fragmented and large instance areas decrease the performance of the
swapping mechanism. Note that VMs' instance buffers are not accessible to
VxDs or TSRs; they are local data structures to be accessed by the VMM
only.
<P>
One consequence of this approach is that changes that are made to instanced
data while in Windows are lost after Windows terminates because the startup
snapshot is restored then. For example, if files opened with handles are
open before Windows enhanced mode starts up, these files should not be
touched while Windows is running, because the internal structures that
represent the files in MS-DOS are instanced.
<P>
Using the Windows termination notification broadcasts Interrupt 2fh,
ax=1606h, and 1609h, respectively, a TSR could override the snapshot taking
by providing a snapshot buffer of its own. That buffer would have to reside
in global memory, that is, in the TSR itself, and would be allocated and
filled while the TSR processes the 1609h broadcast; at 1606h time, the TSR
could "undo" the restoration Windows did from its snapshot buffer. However,
this technique requires knowledge of the internal structures of MS-DOS that
are to be manipulated and is therefore not recommended.
<P>
When running the debug version of WIN386.EXE under control of the WDEB386
debugger, the .mi command allows you to examine the currently active
instanced areas.
