The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows Device Development Kit (DDK) for Windows version
   3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The communications driver (COMM.DRV) provided with version 3.0 of the
Microsoft Windows graphical environment returns CE_OVERRUN errors
under "stress" conditions. The text below discusses this error and the
conditions that can cause it to occur.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When an application uses the Windows communications functions, it may
encounter a CE_OVERRUN error. The frequency of this error depends on
the machine configuration; however, the baud rate is normally the most
critical factor. Generally, the higher the baud rate, the greater the
probability a CE_OVERRUN error.
<P>
The CE_OVERRUN error indicates an "overrun" of the receive buffer in
the universal asynchronous receiver transmitter (UART). The COMM
driver obtains this error by reading the line status register (LSR) of
the UART -- of which bit 1 is set when an overrun error occurs.
<P>
When the COMM driver cannot service a Received Data Available
interrupt before it receives the next transmitted character, the UART
signals an error because at least one character has been lost.
<P>
One cause that prevents the COMM driver from servicing an interrupt
quickly enough is that interrupts are disabled for an extended period
of time -- this condition is commonly referred to as "interrupt
latency."
<P>
Some of the biggest contributors to interrupt latency are terminate-
and-stay-resident programs (TSRs) such as network drivers, pop-up
utilities, and drive cache programs. TSRs are not known to cooperate
well with other interrupt-intensive applications, such as the COMM
driver.
<P>
Windows processes communications in this fashion for performance
reasons. However, it does leave Windows vulnerable to ill-behaved
applications. The COMM driver is very sensitive to ill-behaved
applications because, at 9600 baud, characters can arrive at a
frequency of approximately 1000 Hz (1 character every millisecond); at
19.2K baud, that frequency doubles. This is near the limit for an
interrupt service routine (ISR) running under Windows.
<P>
There is an additional problem that may cause CE_OVERRUN errors and
data loss when running in standard mode on an 80286 computer. Windows
must regularly switch the processor from protected mode into real mode
to pass data to MS-DOS, MS-DOS drivers, and TSRs. This mode switch
occurs a minimum of 18.2 times per second (to update the time-of-day
clock). Because the 80286 does not provide a built-in method to switch
the processor from protected mode into real mode, the system must
reset the processor. This "trick" requires up to 1 millisecond to
complete.
<P>
In addition, during the transition, interrupts are disabled.
Therefore, if a COMM interrupt arrives during one of these
transitions, it may be lost, which is more of a problem on some
machines than on others. The speed of the transition varies depending
on the speed of the processor, the speed of installed memory, and
other factors. If Windows is running in standard mode on an 80386
computer, losing interrupts should not be a problem because the 80386
is designed to make the protected mode to real mode transition easier
and faster.
<P>
There are even more factors that can affect interrupt latency in the
enhanced mode of Windows. CE_OVERRUN errors can occur more often if
more than one virtual machine (VM) is running (that is, standard MS-
DOS applications are running under Windows).
<P>
The source of the problem is the enhanced mode Windows virtual machine
architecture. There is a certain amount of overhead associated with
virtualizing interrupts and device ports. However, the largest problem
in this area is interrupt latency caused by transitions between VMs.
<P>
Enhanced mode Windows performs preemptive multitasking between VMs.
Several times each second, Windows performs a "task switch" from one
VM to another. If COMMAND.COM or an MS-DOS application is running
under Windows, two VMs are present in the system, one for the MS-DOS
application and one for Windows itself and its applications. If a COMM
port interrupt occurs while the MS-DOS VM is active, the interrupt
cannot be processed because the COMM driver cannot be called until the
Windows VM becomes active again. Normally, this will be handled
quickly enough, but there are times when the switch does not occur
fast enough. Windows 3.0 has a virtual device driver (VxD) to buffer
characters until the correct VM is scheduled (the VxD is called
COMBUFF.386 and is automatically installed with Windows when a machine
is capable of running in enhanced mode). COMBUFF.386 helps to correct
this problem considerably; however, it does not eliminate the problem.
<P>
The following three items are factors that affect interrupt latency
and task switches in enhanced mode:

<OL><P><LI>MS-DOS spends most of its time in a state that prevents Windows
   from performing a task switch. Almost every MS-DOS call places MS-
   DOS into this state. Therefore, task switches cannot occur during
   file I/O, directory manipulation, screen I/O, getting or setting
   the system time, and so on. Even running COMMAND.COM in a Windows
   window incurs MS-DOS calls to blink the cursor.
<P>
   Large amounts of file I/O in an MS-DOS application may cause an
   application to spend a great deal of time inside MS-DOS. Floppy
   disk file I/O has the greatest impact. If too much time is spent in
   MS-DOS, a task switch will not occur soon enough for the COMM
   interrupt to be processed correctly.

<P><LI>Interrupts are not processed when interrupts are disabled. There
   are various times in Windows and in MS-DOS when interrupts are
   disabled. Also, Windows provides expanded memory (EMS) emulation
   for banking Windows applications into and out of conventional
   memory. Interrupts are disabled during the EMS task switch. These
   times are generally very short, but when they occur in conjunction
   with task switch latency, they can combine to cause the problem.

<P><LI>Higher-priority interrupts are processed before lower-priority
   interrupts. This often is not a problem; however, difficulties have
   been seen more often when the system uses a serial mouse. The mouse
   has a higher interrupt priority than the COMM port. If the mouse is
   using one of the COMM ports, communication with the mouse is
   relatively slow. Therefore, if the mouse is very active, mouse
   processing takes a high priority and a relatively long time to
   complete which may cause the system to miss a COMM interrupt.
<P>
</OL>In all of these cases, a faster machine performs better because the
time spent in MS-DOS, or with interrupts disabled, is less, and
therefore more time is available to process the COMM interrupts.
<P>
Running Windows in standard mode on an 80386 machine eliminates the
virtualizing layer of Windows and yet retains the improved mode switch
of the 80386 processor. Eliminating unnecessary TSRs and MS-DOS
drivers may help; decreasing the number of applications and VMs
running simultaneously can only help matters.
<P>
There is no easy, general method to work around this problem. In
general, the COMM.DRV performs better at lower baud rates (300 to 2400
baud). As in all serial communications, the only way to guarantee that
data is not lost is to use a packet/protocol transmission scheme.
Using this type of protocol, it is possible to detect errors in
packets and, more importantly, to request retransmission of an
incorrectly received packet.
<P>
Another thing to keep in mind while when developing a communications
application is to test with dedicated hardware. For example, if two
computers are running Windows in enhanced mode, and data is sent back
and forth at 19.2K baud, the system is NOT under stress. Both machines
are affected by the interrupt latency inherent in enhanced mode
Windows. Therefore, the effective throughput is probably not 19.2K
baud. Even though each character is transmitted at 19.2K baud, no
adjustment is made for the delay between characters.
<P>
Instead, dedicate the "remote" machine to an MS-DOS terminal program
that can maintain an effective throughput of 19.2K baud. It is quite
likely that it will be necessary to decrease the baud rate to 9600 or
even to 2400 for the Windows-based application to receive all the data
correctly.
<P>
Another option is to modify the COMM.DRV to support a buffered UART.
The source for the COMM.DRV is provided with the Windows Device
Development Kit (DDK). The INS16550A UART is pin-for-pin compatible
with the 8250 and 16450.
