<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows Device Driver Kit (DDK) for Windows version 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When it is subjected to a heavy load during full-duplex
communications, the transmit portion of the Microsoft Windows
communications driver (COMM.DRV) stops working (no characters are
sent). This problem occurs in real, standard, and enhanced modes. The
receive portion of the communications driver is unaffected.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
COMM.DRV encounters a "deadlock" situation during full-duplex
operation.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, an application must detect whether
deadlock has occurred. This can be done by setting a timer in Windows
that sends a message to the application every one or two seconds. When
the application receives timer message, check the txQueue count in
COMM.DRV. If the count has not changed since the last message
(indicating that no characters have been sent), the application calls
the FlushComm function and resends the data that was not transmitted.
The alternative, which is not recommended, is to close the COM port
and then reopen it. No ill side effects, other than some performance
degradation, have been observed from using these techniques.
<P>
For applications that are very transmission intensive -- for example,
sending data through a full-duplex communications line for an extended
period of time -- the 1 to 2 second wait might be considered too long.
For these applications, shorten the checking interval as desired.
However, if the interval is too short, the application may detect
deadlock when it has not actually occurred. Unnecessary calls to
FlushComm and resending data would degrades the performance of the
application.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows version 3.0. This
problem was fixed in the Windows for Workgroups 3.11 COMM.DRV and above.
