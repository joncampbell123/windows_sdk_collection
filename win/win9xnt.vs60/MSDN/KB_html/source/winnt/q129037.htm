<P>
</OL>------------------------------- Screen 1 ----------------------------------
Welcome to Setup-----Choose R from the bottom of the screen for repair
process.
<P>
As part of the repair Process, Setup will perform each of the optional
tasks shown below with an "X" in it's check box.
<P>
To perform the selected tasks, press ENTER to indicate "Continue." If you
want to select or deselect any item in the list, press the UP or DOWN arrow
key to move the highlight to the item you want to change.
<P>
Then press ENTER.
<P>
<PRE>   [X]   Inspect registry files.
   [X]   Inspect startup environment.
   [X]   Verify Windows NT system files.
   [X]   Inspect Boot Sector.
      Continue &lt;perform selected tasks&gt;

----------------------------- End Screen 1 --------------------------------
<P>
*** Explanation of these options:

<UL><LI>Inspect Configuration Registry Files: choosing this option will take the
   user to a second screen. And this option attempts to load each file in
   the registry that is selected from that screen to determine whether or
   not it may have become corrupt. If Setup determines that part of the
   registry has become corrupted, it will recommend that the file be
   restored. The user can accept or ignore the recommendation.

<LI>Inspect Startup environment: This option checks the boot files such as
   NTLDR, NTDETECT.COM etc...

<LI>Verify Windows NT System Files: This selection uses a checksum to verify
   that each file in the installation is good and matches the files that
   were originally installed. If files are missing or corrupt, they can be
   restored from the installation disks or CD.

<LI>Inspect Boot Sector: This option will repair the boor sector on drive C
   and reinstall the Boot Loader functionality.
<P>
</UL>------------------------------- Screen 2 ----------------------------------
Windows Setup
<P>
Setup automatically detects floppy disk controllers and standard EDSI/IDE
disks without user intervention. However on some computers detection of
certain other mass storage devices, such as SCSI adapters and CD-ROM
drives, can cause the computer to become unresponsive or to malfunction
temporarily.
<P>
For this reason, you can bypass Setup's mass storage device detection and
manually select SCSI adapters, CD-ROM drives, and special disk controllers
(such as drive arrays) for installation.
<P>
<PRE>  To continue, Press ENTER.
   Setup will attempt to detect mass storage devices in your computer.

  To skip mass storage device detection, press S.
   Setup will allow you to manually select SCSI adapters, CD-ROM drives,
   and special disk controllers for installation.

F3=Exit         ENTER=Continue      S=Skip Detection
</PRE>----------------------------- End Screen 2 --------------------------------
<P>
*** After selecting to continue it will load the SCSI drivers and request
<PRE>    setup disk 3

</PRE>------------------------------- Screen 3 ----------------------------------
Setup has recognized the following mass storage devices in your computer
<P>
<PRE>   &lt;Your SCSI adapter&gt;  -or-  &lt;None&gt;


  To specify additional SCSI adapters, CD-ROM drives, or special disk
   controllers for use with Windows NT, including those for which you have
   a device support disk from a mass storage device manufacturer, press S.

  If you do not have any device support disks from a mass storage device
   manufacturer, or do not want to specify additional mass storage devices
   for use with Windows NT, press ENTER.

S=Specify Additional Device   ENTER=Continue   F3=Exit
</PRE>----------------------------- End Screen 3 --------------------------------
<P>
<P>
------------------------------- Screen 4 ----------------------------------
<PRE>                           [NT V3.5x specific]

</PRE>As part of the repair process, Setup may need to replace files on your hard
disk with original copies from your Windows NT distribution disks.
<P>
Because Setup can use either a CD-ROM or 3.5" disks, you must now select
the media from which Setup should copy original files if it needs to.
<P>
<PRE>  If you have a Windows NT Setup CD-ROM, press ENTER.

  If you have Windows NT 3.5x" Setup disks, press A.

Differences Between Windows NT 3.1 and 3.5x Repair Processes
 

<OL><P><LI>The 3.5 Repair process goes through the 2nd disk before prompting
   the user to choose the repair process.

<P><LI>The 3.5 Repair process offers an additional choice for checking the
   boot files. It allows the user to select either the Boot Sector or
   the Startup Environment. The 3.1 repair process offers only the
   Boot Files which includes both of the previous choices.

<P><LI>The 3.5 Repair process offers the ability to specify the path for
   the repair information. The user does not have to have a physical
   floppy disk on which the repair information is stored, but can
   choose to use the information stored in the &lt;SYSTEMROOT&gt;\REPAIR
   subdirectory.

<P><LI>The 3.5 Repair process offers the ability to designate the source
   media for the original distribution files either CD-ROM or the
   A: Drive.

<P><LI>The 3.5 Repair process offers the choice to insert a disk with a
   driver for 3rd party disk controllers.
<P>
</OL><h3>Differences Between Windows NT 3.5 and 4.0 Repair Processes</h3>
 
<P>
Same as the differences stated above with the exception of 4.
NT V4.0 requires access to the installation CD-ROM Drive.
