The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5 and 3.51
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you attempt to add a remoteboot workstation to the Remoteboot Manager
in Windows NT. The following error messages appears when you manually enter
the media access control address of a workstation:
<P>
<PRE>   The following error occurred creating the workstation: Chosen profile is
   incompatible with this workstation.

</PRE>The following error message appears when you select a media access control
address that has been broadcast over the network and choose the Convert
Adapters option.
<P>
<PRE>   You have specified a profile which is not compatible with the adapter
   for this workstation."

</PRE>In addition to this message, note that the selected profile in the Convert
Adapters dialog box displays a workstation with a red X drawn through it,
indicating that this profile is invalid for this workstation.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Windows NT examines the media access control address of the workstation's
network adapter to determine if the adapter is valid for the selected
configuration. The first six hexadecimal digits are examined and compared
to a database kept by the Remoteboot Manager. The first six digits are a
unique vendor ID. The remaining six digits are a unique network adapter
address.
<P>
Should a vendor acquire a new vendor ID, Windows NT will flag this media
access control address as invalid because the new ID does not match those
held in the remoteboot database.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Update the database so that it will recognize the new vendor ID.
The steps below are an example, using an updated vendor ID for a 3Com
Etherlink III adapter.

<OL><P><LI>Obtain the new media access control address for the workstation that
    you want to add as a remoteboot workstation. This can often be done
    with utilities that are included with the adapter. Another method can
    also be used: with the remoteboot service started, boot the remote
    workstation. Although the boot process will not be able to complete,
    the media access control address of the workstation will be broadcast
    over the network and captured by the Windows NT remoteboot service.
    Press F5 while Remoteboot Manager is the foreground task to refresh the
    screen. The media access control address of the machine just booted
    should be displayed. Note the first six digits of this address (the
    vendor ID).

<P><LI>Open a Command Prompt. Some commands entered will display many lines of
    text that may scroll off the Command Prompt window. To retain this
    information click the Command Prompt Control box and choose Properties.
    Select the Screen Size and Position tab. In the Screen Size Buffer
    section increase the value for height to a value such as 200.

<P><LI>At the command prompt, type RPLCMD and press ENTER. A menu will be
</OL>displayed offering choices such as Adapter Boot Config. To select a menu
item, type the first letter of the command and press ENTER.

<OL><P><LI>Select Boot, then Enum. When asked for the Information Level,
    enter 2.

<P><LI>A good deal of information will scroll by. The information for each
    adapter will begin with an entry called "Bootname." Additional
    information for each adapter is indented below that line. Scroll to the
    entry describing the network adapter of interest.
<P>
    This can be easily done by reading the BootComment line for each
    record since this line describes the network card to which the record
    applies. In the case of the Etherlink III used in this example you will
    find that the BootName entry for this card is DOSH.

<P><LI>Note all the information for this adapter, as you will
    need this information later.

<P><LI>Again, select Boot.

<P><LI>Select Add. You will now be prompted for a BootName. Type the same
    name as found in the information you recorded in step 6. For the
    the 3Com Etherlink III, this name is DOSH.

<P><LI>You are now prompted for a VendorName. Type the first six digits
    of the media access control address found in step 1.

<P><LI>You are now prompted for a BbcFile. Enter the same information as found
    in step 6. For the 3Com Etherlink III the BbcFile is:
<P>
       BBLOCK\NETBEUI\ELNK3\DOSBB.CNF.

<P><LI>For BootComment, add any description that makes sense to you.

<P><LI>For WindowsSize, enter a 0 (zero).

<P><LI>You will now be taken back to the menu. Select Quit.
<P>
</OL>The new vendor ID has now been entered into the database. It should now be
possible to add this adapter back into the Remoteboot Manager without
errors.
