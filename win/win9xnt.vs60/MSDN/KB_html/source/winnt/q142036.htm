NEW FEATURES IN WINDOWS NT SSD 1.17
<P>
<P><h2>Features in Windows NT SSD Version 1.17 Rev. B</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Windows NT SSD Setup</h3>
 
<P>
Added a command option to automatically update existing drivers installed
on your system without having to run the GUI SSD setup. Refer to the
Refresh Option section in Using the Windows NT SSD  Setup Program topic for
more help.
<P>
Created a CPQSETUP.PDF and CPQREBT.PDF (Package Definition File) for
Microsoft SMS to automatically update drivers on a client machine. Refer to
the Microsoft SMS Users guide for help and procedures in launching a remote
job to clients. Refer to the Refresh Option section in Using the Windows NT
SSD  Setup Program topic for more help.
<P>
Created a new installation file which installs the Compaq Array
Configuration Utility which configures the new SMART-2 Array Controller.
The utility Files can be obtained from the Support Software CD.
<P>
Both Online and Standby Recovery server options now appear in the main list
of drivers to install. Whichever driver is already installed will be the
option that is highlighted by default.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Compaq NetFlex-2 Driver</h3>
 
<P>
Added support to enable or disable either or both ports of the DualPort
Token-Ring Controller. This can be done via the Configure button in the
Network Control Panel. Refer to the sections Notes on NetFlex and Advanced
Registry Parameters for more information.
<P>
Fixed a problem where in token-ring, a lobe wire fault was falsely giving a
successful completion. The lobe wire fault occurs when the cable is
disconnected from the hub and the adapter continues to try to reinsert into
the ring. Without having corrected cable connections, after some time the
adapter gives a successful insertion into the ring.
<P>
<P><h3>Compaq System Management Driver</h3>
 
<P>
Fixed a problem where a shutdown was occurring when the option to shutdown
was disabled.
<P>
Fixed a problem where redundant power supply failures do not cause a CIM
agents notification until another health event occurs.
<P>
Fixed a problem where getting HAL and HEALTH driver version on an ISA
system returned null values.
<P>
<P><h3>Compaq Shutdown Driver</h3>
 
<P>
Modified for a quicker system restart time of less than 10 seconds.
<P>
<P><h2>Features in Windows NT SSD Version 1.17 Rev. A</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Compaq Drive Array Driver</h3>
 
<P>
New support for the SCSI Managed Array Technology-2 controllers for EISA
and PCI systems, referred to as SMART-2/E and /P Controllers.
<P>
<P><h3>Compaq 32-Bit SCSI-2 Controllers SCSI Miniport Driver</h3>
 
<P>
Fixed a problem where the driver was communicating to a non-existent HAL
when being loaded by NTLDR or some other setup loader program.
<P>
Added different methods of initialization for PCI controllers depending on
what HAL Support is being run.
<P>
<P><h3>Compaq NetFlex-3 Driver</h3>
 
<P>
Added support to log a message to the event log if the Burned-In-Address or
Universal Admin Address is invalid.
<P>
Fixed a problem where if on a Token-Ring adapter, the cable was not
connected to the adapter interface, the system will hang. This also fixes
the problem with the DualPort NetFlex-TR not connected to the adapter
interface.
<P>
Added support during installation for configuring full duplex on the
100Base-TX module when configured for 10Base-T.
<P>
<P><h3>Compaq System Management Driver</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>    Enhanced modifications for improved performance
    Added support for new interface to support new products
    Increased the number of ECC errors reported from 5 to 20.

</PRE><h3>Compaq HAL Support</h3>
 
<P>
Fixed a problem where if running a PCI bridged device, any device on the
primary bus could be denied IO or Memory resources.
<P>

independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise,
