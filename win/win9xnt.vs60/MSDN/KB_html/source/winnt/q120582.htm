<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The Directory Replicator service fails to start. Event Viewer logs error
1057 or 1069.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
These errors can result from incorrect configuration of the Directory
Replicator service, from incorrect configuration information in the
Registry, or because domain user account information has not been
synchronized. The most likely reason is that the password is invalid or the
account was not granted "Logon as a service" privileges. Verify that you
have completed the following steps to set up the service:

<OL><P><LI>Create a domain user, for example "REPLUSER", with a proper password.
   Make it a member of Domain Users, Backup operators, Replicator groups.
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Select Password never expires.
    - Clear User must change password at next logon.
    - Clear User can not change password.
    - Clear Account disabled.
    - Allow all hours for logon.
    - Do not define a user profile or login script.
</PRE>
<P><LI>From User Manager for Domains, choose User Rights from the Policies
   menu. Select Show advanced user rights and grant the Replicator group
   the "Logon as a Service" right.

<P><LI>From Server Manager for Domains, select the server and choose Services
   from the Computer menu. A list of services running on the server
   appears. Select the Directory Replicator service and choose Startup.

<P><LI>Specify startup type to be automatic and mark the default logon as "This
   account," choosing REPLUSER. Type the correct password for the user in
   the Password and Confirm password fields.
<P>
   NOTE: The only password verification performed at this step is to check
   that the Password and Confirm Password fields are the same. It is
   possible to enter an incorrect user password in these fields; however,
   when the Directory Replicator service attempts to start it will fail.
<P>
</OL>Attempt to start the Directory Replicator service. If the error still
occurs after following the previous steps, there may be a problem with the
Registry information.
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them.
Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of
Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.
<P>
Edit the ObjectName value under the following key in the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
subtree:
<P>
<PRE>   \System\Current Control Set\Service\Replicator

</PRE></OL>Make sure the data type of ObjectName is REG_SZ and the value is &lt;domain
name&gt;\repluser (where &lt;domain name&gt; is the correct domain for the Repluser
account.)
<P>
After editing the Registry, attempt to start the Directory Replicator
service again. If the error persists, there may be a problem with the User
Account or the User Account database. Check the System Event Log for errors
generated by the Netlogon service. Verify that the user account database is
successfully synchronized on all of the servers in the domain. Proceed with
troubleshooting domain synchronization problems if these errors are
revealed.
