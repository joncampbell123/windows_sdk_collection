The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 and 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51 and 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
During an upgrade from Windows NT version 3.51 to Windows NT version 4.0,
the following fatal error message may be displayed:
<P>
<PRE>   An error has been encountered that prevents Setup from continuing. Setup
   was unable to initialize licensing components. The specific error code
   is 127.

</PRE>This error will usually occur during the reboot into the graphical user
interface (GUI) portion of Setup.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
During the upgrade process, the file Liccpa.cpl was not updated and the
upgrade will fail without it.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Replacing the Liccpa.cpl file located in the %SystemRoot%\System32
directory with the one from the Windows NT 4.0 CD will allow the upgrade to
continue.
<P>
<P><h3>If the File System is File Allocation Table (FAT)</h3>
 
<P>
If the file system is FAT, perform the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Start your computer in MS-DOS mode, or another operating system if
   present, and replace the Liccpa.cpl file in the System32 directory with
   the one from the Windows NT 4.0 CD.

<P><LI>Restart the computer, and the upgrade process should continue
   from where it had stopped.
<P>
</OL><h3>If the File System is NTFS</h3>
 
<P>
If the file system is NTFS, perform the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Create a new directory and install a parallel copy of Windows NT in this
   new directory.

<P><LI>Boot into this parallel copy of Windows NT, and copy the Liccpa.cpl file
   in the System32 directory to the System32 directory of the original
   installation of Windows NT.

<P><LI>Restart the computer, and select the original copy of Windows NT from
   the Boot.ini menu. The upgrade process should continue from where it
   stopped.
<P></OL>
