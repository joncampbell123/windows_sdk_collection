<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The 1.16 release of the Compaq Support Software Diskette for
Windows NT 3.5x (NT SSD) contains the following new features and
maintenance modifications:
<P>
New Features in Compaq NT SSD Version 1.16 Pass B
<P>
<P><h3>Compaq On-Line Recovery Server Option</h3>
 
<P>
New support that provides automated switch over for pairs of Compaq
servers connected via a serial link.  The system is composed of
the Compaq ProLiant Storage, Recovery Server switch and the
On-Line Recovery agent.  If one system fails, the surviving server
detects the failure and causes the switch of the drives from the
failed server to itself.  This feature is listed in the SSD as
option line-item Compaq On-Line Recovery Server.
<P>
New Features in Compaq NT SSD Version 1.16 Pass A

Added the option line-item Convert to Uniprocessor Support  when
downgrading from a multi to single processor unit.
<P>
Added the option line-item Upgrade to Multiprocessor Support
when upgrading from a single to multiprocessor-processor unit.
<P>
Added the option line-item Compaq On-Line Recovery Agent for
support.

Added new support for the Advanced Program Interrupt Controller
(APIC) for  dual processor support (HALMPS.DLL)
<P>

with the crashdump utility.

<P>

<P>
<P><h3>Compaq Systems Management Driver</h3>

experience a lock up.  This problem will only occur on Compaq
ProLiant 4000 and ProLiant 4500 installed with 4 processors.

overwritten by a request to change to receive a specific multicast
