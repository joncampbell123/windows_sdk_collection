<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>

charge on CompuServe(R), MSDL, Microsoft's Internet server,

<P>
The Microsoft Network Client software contains the following network
clients and software:
<P>
<PRE>   LAN Manager Basic Client Software for MS-DOS(R) Clients
   LAN Manager Enhanced Software for MS-DOS Clients
   LAN Manager Client Software for OS/2 Clients
   TCP/IP Protocol Stack
   Microsoft Data Link Control (DLC) Protocol
   Microsoft Remote Access Service (RAS) Client
   NetWare(R) Client Software for MS-DOS Clients

</PRE>Before you can run the Setup program to install the Microsoft Network
Client, you must download the appropriate disk image files, and create
floppy disk installation sets of the Network Client files. For MS-DOS based
clients, there are five files that you must download. For OS/2 based
clients, there are four files that you must download. Each file is a self-
extracting zip file that expands into a disk image of one of the
installation disks.
<P>
Within the respective MS-DOS and OS/2 client download areas, the file
naming convention is
<P>
<PRE>   DSKx-n.EXE (for MS-DOS based clients)
   OS23-n.EXE (for OS/2 based clients)

</PRE>where x specifies the size of the floppy disk (3 for 3.5-inch 1.44 MB
floppies, or 5 for 5.25-inch 1.2 MB floppies), and n specifies the disk
number (1 to 5 for MS-DOS based client, 1 to 4 for OS/2 based client).
<P>
To create a floppy disk installation set, use the following syntax to copy
each of the disk images to an external drive
<P>
<PRE>   &lt;filename&gt; -d &lt;destination drive&gt;

</PRE>at the command prompt. The -d indicates that the directories on DSK3-1.EXE
are to be copied onto a disk located in the B drive. For example, to create
a 3.5-inch (1.44 MB) floppy disk of DSK3-1.EXE, type the following:
<P>
<PRE>   DSK3-1.EXE -d b:

</PRE>For the Microsoft Network Client for MS-DOS, label each of the five disks
as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   ZIP FILE        DISK LABEL
   =====================================
   DSKx-1.EXE      Setup
   DSKx-2.EXE      Drivers1
   DSKx-3.EXE      Drivers2
   DSKx-4.EXE      Remote Access Service
   DSKx-5.EXE      NetWare(R) Client

</PRE>For the Microsoft Network Client for OS/2, label each of the four disks as
follows:
<P>
<PRE>   ZIP FILE        DISK LABEL
   ==================================
   OS23-1.EXE      OS/2 Setup
   OS23-2.EXE      OS/2 Workstation 1
   OS23-3.EXE      OS/2 Workstation 2
   OS23-4.EXE      OS/2 Driver 1
