<P><h3>Installing Windows NT Over Previous Installation</h3>
 
<P>
Question:
<P>
Can I install Windows NT over my previous (beta) version of Windows NT?
<P>
Answer:
<P>
Please refer to SETUP.TXT (included on the Windows NT CD and on Disk 4 of
the installation disks) for complete installation details before installing
Windows NT.
<P>
<P><h3>Selections in boot loader keep returning to the boot loader Menu</h3>
 
<P>
Question:
<P>
Whenever I choose MS-DOS from the boot loader menu, it keeps returning me
to the boot loader menu. Why?
<P>
Answer:
<P>
This can happen when installing Windows NT over a previously existing
Windows NT installation without using the MS-DOS SYS command to activate
the partition. When Windows NT installs, it reads the drive boot sector to
create the BOOTSECT.DOS file. It then uses BOOTSECT.DOS when you select the
previous operating system choice from the Boot loader menu to restore the
original partition information.
<P>
If you install Windows NT over another copy of Windows NT, BOOTSECT.DOS may
contain a copy of the Windows NT partition information and not the MS-DOS
partition information. Each time you select the previous operating system,
the Windows NT partition information is loaded and executed.
<P>
There are two ways to correct this:

<UL><LI>If you have a previous copy of BOOTSECT.DOS, replace the current version
   with the previous version. Note that you cannot use the BOOTSECT.DOS
   file from other machines. This file contains hardware specific
   information and cannot be used across machines.

<LI>If not, you need to recreate the boot sector for MS-DOS by booting from
   an MS-DOS diskette and running SYS C: from that disk. Doing this removes
   the Boot loader feature from your system. To re-enable Boot loader, see
   the entry titled Replacing Boot Sector Without Reinstalling, in the
   Technical Information section.
<P>
</UL><h3>Windows NT Boots but Looks in Wrong Boot Directory</h3>
 
<P>
Question:
<P>
Windows NT looks in the wrong boot directory. Why?
<P>
Answer:
<P>
This can be caused by two things:

<UL><LI>Make sure BOOT.INI refers to the correct Windows NT directory.

<LI>The IBM MOST utility for OS/2 2.0 is installed on the hard disk.
<P>
</UL>Windows NT uses logical partitioning. When an unknown partition type (MOST
for example) sits between the base partition and the Windows NT partition,
it can set the logical partitions off by one. MOST is not supported with
Windows NT.
<P>
Install Windows NT on a machine that does not have the MOST utility
installed.
<P>
<P><h3>Converting the system partition to NTFS on MIPS R4000</h3>
 
<P>
Question:
<P>
Can I convert my MIPS system partition to NTFS?
<P>
Answer:
<P>
No. The ARC specification requires that the system partition be FAT. This
is done so that HAL.DLL and OSLOADER.EXE will be accessible regardless of
the media type. If you want to use NTFS on a MIPS machine, create a small
system partition (1M or larger) to hold HAL.DLL and OSLOADER.EXE. The rest
of the disk can be formatted as an NTFS partition. The installer correctly
puts HAL.DLL and OSLOADER.EXE on the system partition.
<P>
Warning: Do not use CONVERT.EXE on the system partition. It will convert it
to NTFS and the system will no longer boot. If this happens, your only
option is to run ARCINST.EXE from the installation CD-ROM and reformat the
system partition as FAT.
<P>
<P><h3>Windows NT Needs 600K Free</h3>
 
<P>
Question:
<P>
When I start up Windows NT, it gives the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Windows NT has found only xxxxK of low memory, 600K of low memory is
   required to run Windows NT. You may need to upgrade your computer or run
   a configuration program provided by the manufacturer.

</PRE>Answer:
<P>
In order to start Windows NT there must be at least 600K of low memory. You
may need to perform some configuration changes to rearrange the hardware
memory mapping so that 600K of low memory is available.
<P>
<P><h3>What is the $WIN_NT$.~LS Directory</h3>
 
<P>
Question:
<P>
After I attempted to install, Windows NT left a directory named
"$WIN_NT$.~LS" on my hard disk. What is it? Can I delete it?
<P>
Answer:
<P>
This is a temporary directory created by the WINNT.EXE installation
program. The WINNT.EXE program copies all the setup files it needs to your
hard disk, then reboots into Windows NT and runs setup from your hard
drive.
<P>
This directory is normally deleted after a successful installation of
Windows NT. If Setup should fail for some reason, this directory is left on
your hard drive. You can safely delete this directory.
<P>
<P><h3>Setup Fails When Switching from Text to Graphics</h3>
 
<P>
See the entry titled, Fatal Kernel Error 006E or 0071 During Setup, in the
Common Error Messages section.
<P>
<P><h3>Emergency Repair Disk on Unsupported CD-ROM</h3>
 
<P>
Question:
<P>
Can I use the Emergency Repair disk if I install Windows NT from an
unsupported CD-ROM configuration or over the network?
<P>
Answer:
<P>
The Emergency Repair Disk created by the WINNT.EXE installation can ONLY be
used with the Verify Boot Files On Your C: Drive and Inspect Registry Files
options. You CANNOT use the Verify Windows NT System Files option with an
Emergency Repair Disk created by a WINNT.EXE installation because Windows
NT has no way to access the original installation media from Setup.
<P>
You can create an Emergency Repair disk by installing from either CD or
floppy disk. If you install from floppy disk (or from a Setup share created
by floppy disk), you need the original Setup floppy disks to use the
Emergency Repair disk. If you install from CD (or from a Setup share
created by CD), you need the original setup CD to use the Emergency Repair
disk.
<P>
<P><h3>MIPS Installation not working</h3>
 
<P>
Question:
<P>
Why doesn't Windows NT work on my MIPS machine?
<P>
Answer:
<P>
MIPS machines require a hardware update in order to run Windows NT. The CPU
must have an R4000 version of 2.0 or later. Please contact your hardware
manufacturer if you have not already obtained an update.
<P>
<P><h3>Updating LAN Manager 2.x Network to Advanced Server</h3>
 
<P>
Question:
<P>
I have servers with LAN Manager 2.0c and later installed. How can I begin
planning and convert my system over to Windows NT Advanced Server?
<P>
Answer:
<P>
The Windows NT Advanced Server Upgrade is available today at $595, and can
be obtained at most retail outlets, from your local Solution Provider, or
your MS Network Reseller. You can get more information on the Windows NT
Advanced Server Upgrade product by calling Microsoft Sales and Information
Center at 1 (800) 426-9400. The Upgrade product contains the Windows NT
Advanced Server product, the Upgrade Planning Guide, the Upgrade Guide, and
complete Upgrade Utilities. Customers who bought the Upgrade product
between August and the third week October 1993, during which time the
Windows NT Advanced Server Upgrade product did not contain the Upgrade
Guide and Utilities, can receive the Upgrade Utilities and Upgrade Guide,
free of charge, by sending in the fulfillment coupon included in the box.
<P>
For customers who purchased Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server 3.1 and
would like the Upgrade Guide and Upgrade Utilities, they can call Microsoft
Product Support Services to order the Upgrade Utilities and the Upgrade
Guide.
<P>
The Windows NT Advanced Server is a very compelling Upgrade. The Upgrade
will specifically:

<UL><LI>Inventory your existing LAN Manager configuration
<LI>Back up and restore User Accounts and associated Permissions
<LI>Back up and restore environment including, Scheduled Commands, UPS,
   Shared Directories, Network Connections, and Network Services.
<LI>Back up data to tape or another network server
<LI>Perform reliable file-system conversion without destroying data
<LI>Restore Services for Macintosh
<LI>Allow seamless implementation of single network log-on.
<LI>Generate a log of all changes to validate Upgrade for completeness
<LI>Clone Upgrade: You can choose to install Windows NT Advanced Server on a
   separate computer and transfer (clone) the LAN
<LI>Manager server data and services from an existing server to the new
   Windows NT Advanced Server. A clone upgrade allows you to upgrade to a
   Windows NT-compatible x86, Pentium, R4000(R) and R4400, Digital Alpha
   AXP systems or/and multiprocessor machines.
<LI>In-place Upgrade: You can choose to upgrade an existing LAN Manager
   server in place.
<P>
</UL>Further, Windows NT Advanced Server is compatible with LAN Manager client
software. Only LAN Manager servers need to be upgraded to benefit from
complete Windows NT Advanced Server functionality. There is no need to
change the networking software on each desktop. LAN Manager and Windows NT
Advanced Servers can coexist and customers can upgrade to Windows NT
Advanced Server with minimal effort, maintaining availability of network
resources and network management.
