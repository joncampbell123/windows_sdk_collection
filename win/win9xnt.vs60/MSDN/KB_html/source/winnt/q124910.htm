<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes using Ontrack Disk Manager on an MS-DOS system to
partition and format a large (more than 540 megabytes [MB]) IDE hard disk
drive. A large IDE hard disk drive usually requires a system BIOS or
controller that supports more than 1024 cylinders. For general information
on installing Windows NT on large IDE hard disk drives, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : Installing Windows NT on Large IDE Disk Drives

</PRE>NOTE: To use Ontrack Disk Manager with Windows NT version 3.5, you need to
obtain an updated driver from Microsoft Product Support Services.
<P>
This updated driver (ATDISK.SYS) is included with the latest U.S. Service
Pack for Windows NT version 3.5. For information on obtaining the Service
Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without
the spaces):
<P>
<PRE>   S E R V P A C K

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Installing the Updated Driver</h3>
 
<P>
Once you obtain the updated driver, if you are installing it on a system
already running Windows NT version 3.5, follow the installation
instructions included with the updated driver or Service Pack.
<P>
If you are attempting to install Windows NT version 3.5 on a drive that
has been formatted with Ontrack Disk Manager, installation of the updated
driver is complicated and depends upon whether you are installing from a
CD-ROM or from floppy disk.
<P>
<P><h3>CD-ROM Installation</h3>
 
<P>
Installing from a CD-ROM onto a disk formatted with Ontrack Disk Manager
requires that you boot the system under MS-DOS and access the CD-ROM.
After booting under MS-DOS, start installation from the \I386 directory on
the CD-ROM using the WINNT.EXE command. Allow the Windows NT Setup program
to create three boot disks and copy files to the temporary directory,
$WIN_NT$.~LS. You may also use the WINNT /B mode of Setup, which does not
require the three boot floppy disks but does require more free space on
your boot partition. After the file copy is finished, Setup asks you to
reboot the system with the boot floppy disk in drive A; do not do this.
Instead, reboot to MS-DOS and do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Replace the ATDISK.SYS file on Setup Disk 3 with the updated file. If
   you used the /b option on Windows NT, replace ATDISK.SYS in the
   $WIN_NT$.~BT directory instead.
<P>
   NOTE: If your copy of ATDISK.SYS is compressed (ends with .SY_ instead
   of .SYS) you will need to decompress it, using the expand command,
   before replacing the copy on the installation disks.

<P><LI>Replace the ATDISK.SYS file in the directory $WIN_NT$.~LS with the
   updated file.

<P><LI>Reboot the system and when Disk Manager gives you the option of
   starting from a boot floppy disk, select this option and boot from
   Setup Disk 1.
<P>
</OL>This should allow you to set up Windows NT version 3.5 on a drive
formatted with Ontrack Disk Manager.
<P>
<P><h3>Floppy Disk Installation</h3>
 
<P>
Floppy installation on an Ontrack Disk Manager-formatted drive requires
that you install Windows NT on to a FAT partition. You can convert the
partition to NTFS after Setup is complete. To set up, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Make a disk copy of Setup Disk 3.

<P><LI>Replace ATDISK.SYS on the disk copy with the updated ATDISK.SYS file.
<P>
   NOTE: If your copy of ATDISK.SYS is compressed (ends with .SY_ instead
   of .SYS) you will need to decompress it, using the expand command,
   before replacing the copy on the installation disks.

<P><LI>Reboot the system and when Disk Manager gives you the option of
   starting from a boot floppy disk, select this option and boot from the
   Setup boot disk.

<P><LI>When you reach the first reboot (at Disk 9) do not allow Setup to
   continue; instead reboot to MS-DOS (either using a bootable MS-DOS
   floppy disk or interrupting the boot menu before it loads Setup) and
   replace ATDISK.SYS in &lt;WINNT&gt;\SYSTEM32\DRIVERS with the updated file,
   and then reboot and allow Setup to finish.
<P>
</OL>After you finish installing Windows NT version 3.5, you can convert your
partitions from FAT to NTFS if you want. You may experience an extra delay
in booting after you convert your boot partition to NTFS; however, other
than this delay, there are no problems with converting to NTFS.
