<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
On a Windows NT 3.51 workstation or server (in the member-server role), the
following error appears when you log on:
<P>
<PRE>   A domain controller for your domain could not be located. You have been
   logged on using cached information. Changes to your profile since you
   last logged on may not be available.

</PRE>If you check the System Event Log, you find the following event:
<P>
<PRE>Event ID:    5513
Source:      Netlogon
</PRE>Description: The computer name &lt;computer name&gt; connected to server &lt;name&gt;
<PRE>             using the trust relationship to the &lt;name&gt; domain. However,
             the computer doesn't properly know the security identifier
             (SID) for the domain. Reestablish the trust relationship.

</PRE>If you find this event, check basic networking functionality and
then follow the procedure indicated below.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
These error messages indicate the Windows NT workstation or server computer
account information does not match that held by the authenticating domain
controller. The computer account information is held in the registry on the
Windows NT workstation or server and on all domain controllers. There are a
number of things that can cause the computer account database on the domain
controller to have different information than the computer itself, for
example, if systems account manager (SAM) and Security were restored to a
different version (either by emergency repair or from a tape restore). The
trust relationship a computer has with the domain it is a member of is
similar to the trust relationship a domain can have with another domain
with respect to the account that is created.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the primary domain controller (PDC), open Server Manager and locate
   the Windows NT workstation or Windows NT server (member-server) that is
   getting the errors.

<P><LI>Select that computer account, select Computer on the menu
   bar and then select Remove From Domain. This will delete the entry for
   that computer (The entry you see will not disappear immediately;
   this is nothing to be concerned about.)

<P><LI>Immediately, select Computer in the menu bar and then select
   Add To Domain. Click Windows NT Workstation or Server, then
   supply the computer name as defined in Control Panel&gt;Network for the
   affected computer. Click OK.

<P><LI>On the Windows NT workstation or Windows NT server with the error
   message, log on with a local administrative account. Open the Network
   tool in Control Panel. Press the Change button that is next to the
   Domain or Workgroup name. Make sure to select Workgroup and type a
   fictitious Workgroup name. Click OK.

<P><LI>A dialog welcoming the computer to the new workgroup appears. Click OK.
   Close Control Panel and choose Yes when prompted to restart the
   computer.

<P><LI>On the same Windows NT workstation or Windows NT server, log on again
   with a local administrative account. Open the Network tool in Control
   Panel. Press the Change button that is next to the Domain or Workgroup
   name. This time, make sure to select Domain and type your Windows NT
   domain name and click OK.

<P><LI>A dialog welcoming the system to the domain appears; click OK. Close
   Control Panel and choose Yes when prompted to restart the computer.

<P><LI>After this restart, on the FROM line in the logon dialog box, click the
   arrow to display a list of domain entries. Log on to the domain with a
   valid domain account.
<P>
</OL>This procedure should eliminate Event ID: 5513.
