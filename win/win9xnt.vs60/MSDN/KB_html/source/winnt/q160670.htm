<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The FPSCR (Floating Point Status and Control Register) is not being saved
during the thread context save/restore procedure. It may cause an invalid
floating-point exception mask.
<P>
NOTE: This problem happens on PowerPC-based computers only.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When a process has multiple threads, the FPSCR register is not being saved
during the thread context save restore procedure. It is being treated as a
per process resource rather than a per thread resource.
<P>
For example:
<P>
The first thread in a process unmasks a floating point exception, for
example divide by zero, and then spawns another thread and waits for it to
exit. The other thread unmasks a different exception, for example
underflow, and then exits. When the first thread gets scheduled, the FPSCR
register is set to underflow being unmasked, but divide by zero being
masked. Thus, when the first thread executes, the FPSCR register is set to
the state left by the second thread.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0.
This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 U.S.
Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
