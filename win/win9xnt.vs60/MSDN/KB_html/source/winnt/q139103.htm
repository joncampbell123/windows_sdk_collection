<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article discusses directory replication to a domain name in a Wide
Area Network (WAN) environment, why import computers located across a
router or bridge may not receive notification, and the procedures for
configuring these computers to receive replicated data.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Page 459 of the Windows NT "Server System Guide" (in the Managing
Directory Replication section) states that replication to a domain name
does not always succeed when some or all of the replication import
computers are located across a wide area network (WAN) bridge from an
export server. When adding names to the export list on an export server,
and when adding names to the import list on an import computer, for those
computers separated by a WAN bridge you should specify the computer names
(instead of or in addition to specifying the domain name).
<P>
The details of why this is documented and how replication works in this
situation are as follows:
<P>
When the option to export directories is chosen, and no entries exist in
the "To List", the export server defaults to exporting to the local domain.
From the export server, mailslots addressed to "\MAILSLOT\NET\REPL_CLI" are
broadcast to a multicast address, and if in a TCP/IP environment, a
broadcast is sent to the subnet on which the export server resides.
Included in the Server Message Block (SMB) is the name of the domain the
export server is broadcasting for. An import computer listening for this
broadcast responds and sets up a replication session if the import
computers domain name equals that of the destination domain name included
in the packet. However, import computers that are configured to import from
the domain, but are across routers or bridges from where these broadcasts
are not forwarded do not receive notification from the export server, and
do not receive replicated data.
<P>
To replicate directories to import computers across the router or bridge,
add the NetBIOS name of the computer to the "To List" on the export server.
When the replication interval occurs, the NetBIOS name is resolved and a
mailslot addressed to "\MAILSLOT\NET\REPL_CLI" is directed at the import
computer specified.
