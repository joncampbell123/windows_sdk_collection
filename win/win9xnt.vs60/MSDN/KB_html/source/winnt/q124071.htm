<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you have the Creative Labs Sound Blaster 16 SCSI II controller and are
booting from a SCSI hard disk drive connected to another SCSI controller
(such as an Adaptec SCSI controller), you are not able to boot from a SCSI
hard disk drive connected to either adapter under Windows NT 3.5 and still
have Windows NT recognize the SCSI II port. Windows NT only recognizes the
SCSI II port on the Sound Blaster adapter if the adapter is configured for
interrupt 11, which forces it to set its SCSI II port to SCSI port zero.
Because the Sound Blaster does not have a boot ROM BIOS, it cannot manage
your boot hard disk drive. Further, since you cannot boot from the second
SCSI port (SCSI port 1) on your other SCSI controller, you can not boot
hard disk drive from the there either.
<P>
Creative Labs has confirmed this to be a problem in the Sound Blaster 16
driver for Windows NT version 3.5.
<P>
NOTE: The driver limits SCSI II port recognition to interrupt 11. The
adapter itself limits the SCSI ID to port 0 if the interrupt is set to 11.
Adaptec is working on a resolution to both of these limitations.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Connect all your devices to the other SCSI controller and set it for
interrupt 11. You will not be able to see your SCSI II port on the Sound
Blaster adapter under Windows NT, but you will be able to use your SCSI
devices and boot from your SCSI hard disk drive.
