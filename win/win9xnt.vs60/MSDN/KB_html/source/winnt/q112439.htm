</PRE><h2>MICROSOFT SUPPORT SERVICES FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE DEAF OR HARD-OF-HEARING</h2>
 
<P>
Through text telephone (TT/TDD) services, Microsoft provides the same
technical product support and customer service for both people who are
deaf or hard-of-hearing and hearing customers.
<P>
For sales information and nontechnical customer service, you can
contact the Microsoft Sales Information Center on a text telephone at
(800) 892-5234 between 6:30 A.M. and 5:30 P.M. Pacific time. For
technical assistance, you can contact Microsoft Product Support
Services (PSS) on a text telephone at (425) 635-4948 between 6:00 A.M.
and 6:00 P.M. Pacific time. Microsoft support services are subject to
Microsoft's prices, terms, and conditions in place at the time the

<P>
<P><h2>KEYBOARD LAYOUTS FOR SINGLE-HANDED COMPUTER USERS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft distributes software to modify your keyboard layout. These
keyboard layouts can be useful for people who have difficulty using
the standard QWERTY layout. You can use these drivers to modify your
keyboard configuration without changing your physical keyboard.
<P>
Windows NT has built-in support for the two-handed Dvorak keyboard
layout, which may be useful for preventing or coping with some types
of repetitive motion injuries associated with typing. To use this
layout, choose the International icon in Control Panel. Two additional
layouts are provided for people who type with the left hand only or
with the right hand only. These layouts can also be useful for people
who type with a single finger or a wand.
<P>

</PRE><h2>PRODUCTS FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE BLIND OR HAVE LOW VISION</h2>
 
<P>
If you are blind or have low vision, many products are available to
help you use Windows(TM). For persons with low vision, there are
several screen-enlargement utilities. For blind individuals, there are
screen readers that provide alternative output by synthesized voice or
refreshable Braille displays. At the time this Application Note was
written, these types of products were not yet available for Windows
NT. However, Microsoft is working in conjunction with third-party
companies to have these products available for Windows NT in late
1994.
<P>
<P>
<PRE>    CUSTOMIZING WINDOWS NT WITHOUT ADDITIONAL HARDWARE OR SOFTWARE
    ==============================================================

</PRE>There are many ways you can adjust the appearance and behavior of
Windows NT to suit varying eyesight and motor skill needs without any
additional software or hardware. For example, by changing settings in
the Windows NT Registry, you can control screen colors, font sizes,
and mouse behavior. You can change these settings in Control Panel or
by directly modifying the Registry. The following sections describe
how to identify which settings to modify to achieve the desired
results and how to safely modify the Registry.
<P>
NOTE: This section applies to both Windows NT and Windows NT Advanced
Server version 3.1 and Windows NT Workstation and Windows NT Server
version 3.5.
<P>
<P><h2>MODIFYING THE REGISTRY</h2>
 
<P>
The Registry contains information about your system environment. You
can configure Windows NT and Windows-based applications to meet your
needs and preferences by modifying the information stored in the
Registry. You may need administrative privileges to modify the
Registry. If so, contact your system administrator. For more
information about the Registry, refer to the Windows NT Resource Kit.
<P>
You can use the following procedure to make Registry changes described
later in this Application NOTE:

<OL><P><LI>Create a backup copy of the Registry. If you do not have backup
   privileges, contact your system administrator for assistance.

<P><LI>Start Registry Editor (REGEDT32.EXE).

<P><LI>Find the appropriate key.

<P><LI>Edit the specific values in the String Editor dialog box by
   selecting the value.
<P>
   Many of the Registry entries discussed below are not present in the
   Registry by default. To add them:
<P>
   a. Select the subkey you want to modify.
<P>
   b. From the Edit menu, choose Add Value.
<P>
   c. Type the value name in the Value Name field.
<P>
   d. Make sure the Data Type is REG_SZ.
<P>
   e. Choose OK.
<P>
   f. Type the values in the String box of the String Editor dialog
<P><PRE>      box.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Save the Registry.

<P><LI>Restart Windows NT so that the changes take effect.
<P>
   NOTE: When you add the values specified in this Application Note,
   always choose REG_SZ as the Data Type.
<P>
</OL><h2>CHANGING COLORS</h2>
 

<UL><LI>If you have trouble differentiating the system colors, or if they
   cause eyestrain, you can adjust them in the Colors dialog box of
   Control Panel.

<LI>If the desktop pattern or wallpaper causes eyestrain, you can
   adjust them in the Desktop dialog box of Control Panel.

<LI>If you have trouble differentiating the colors used by Windows
   Help, you can adjust them by using the following subkey under the
   HKEY_CURRENT_USER subtree:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Software\Microsoft\Windows Help registry
</PRE><P>
   This key allows you to control the following Help features:

<LI>IFJumpColor=red &lt;value&gt; green &lt;value&gt; blue &lt;value&gt;
<P>
<P><PRE>      Specifies the color of text that, when chosen, leads to a new
      panel of information in another Help file.
</PRE>
<LI>IFPopupColor=red &lt;value&gt; green &lt;value&gt; blue &lt;value&gt;
<P>
<P><PRE>      Specifies the color of text that, when chosen, displays a pop-up
      panel (the type of panel used for glossary definitions) located
      in a different Help file.
</PRE>
<LI>JumpColor=red &lt;value&gt; green &lt;value&gt; blue &lt;value&gt;
<P>
<P><PRE>      Specifies the color of text that, when chosen, leads to a new
      panel of Help information.
</PRE>
<LI>MacroColor=red &lt;value&gt; green &lt;value&gt; blue &lt;value&gt;
<P>
<P><PRE>      Specifies the color of text that, when chosen, runs a Help
      macro.
</PRE>
<LI>PopupColor=red &lt;value&gt; green &lt;value&gt; blue &lt;value&gt;
<P>
<P><PRE>      Specifies the color of text that, when chosen, displays a pop-up
      panel (the type of panel used for glossary definitions).
</PRE><P>
   Valid values are 000 to 999, with 999 specifying the highest
   intensity. You must include three digits for each value, and you
   must include each color value. You can experiment with this setting
   to create a color that works best for you. The following table
   lists some colors you can work with:
<P>
<PRE>   Setting       |   Resulting color
</PRE></OL> 
<PRE>                 |
   000 000 000   |   Black
   000 000 999   |   Blue
   000 999 000   |   Green
   999 000 000   |   Red
   999 999 000   |   Yellow
   999 000 999   |   Magenta
   999 999 999   |   White

   For example: To change the jump color to red, you would type 999
   000 000 for the value of JumpColor.

</PRE></UL><h2>CHANGING FONTS</h2>
 

<UL><LI>If you have trouble reading the Windows NT system fonts (which are
   used to display window titles, menus, and dialog boxes), you may be
   able to increase the font size from the Display section of Control
   Panel. If your video driver does not provide this capability, you
   can also increase the font size by editing the Registry. You can
   change the FONTS.FON value in the following subkey under the
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree to the font of your choice:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\GRE_Initialize
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: You must use a font file with an .FON extension. For example,
   you can use 8514SYS.FON. Also, some dialog boxes may not fit on
   your screen if you choose a very large font.

<LI>If you have trouble reading the titles of icons, you can adjust
   their appearance by editing the Registry. To do so, go to the
   following subkey under the HKEY_CURRENT_USER subtree:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Control Panel\Desktop
</PRE><P>
   Change IconTitleSize and IconTitleFaceName to the size and name
   (respectively) of the font you desire. For example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      IconTitleFaceName=Arial
      IconTitleSize=12
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: To make all your icon titles visible, you may also need to
   adjust the icon spacing in the Desktop dialog box of Control Panel,
   then choose Arrange Icons from the Window menu in Program Manager.

<LI>If you have trouble reading the small fonts used by some
   applications, you can restrict the fonts available to Windows-based
   applications by removing the fonts you do not want from the Fonts
   dialog box of Control Panel. You do not need to actually delete the
   font files from your hard disk drive, just remove them from Control
   Panel. If you remove all the fonts, only the system fonts remain
   available to applications.

<LI>If you have trouble reading the file and directory names in File
   Manager, you can adjust the font settings by choosing Font from the
   Options menu.

<LI>If you have trouble locating the text-selection cursor (also known
   as the caret or insertion point) in your applications, you can
   adjust the rate at which it flashes. To do this, choose the Desktop
   icon in Control Panel.
<P>
</UL><h2>CHANGING SCHEDULE+ AND MAIL SETTINGS</h2>
 

<UL><LI>If you have trouble reading the text in Microsoft Schedule+, you
   can adjust the fonts and colors by choosing Display from the
   Options menu.

<LI>If you have trouble reading the text in Microsoft Mail, you can
   adjust the fonts using the FixedFont, NormalFont, and PrintFont
   values in the following subkey under the HKEY_CURRENT_USER subtree:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Software\Microsoft\Mail\Microsoft Mail
</PRE><P>
   Each value has four parts separated by commas: the font name, point
   size, a flag for bold (0 or 1), and a flag for italic (0 or 1).

<LI>FixedFont=&lt;facename&gt;, &lt;size&gt;, &lt;0&gt;|&lt;1&gt;, &lt;0&gt;|&lt;1&gt;
<P>
<P><PRE>      This value identifies a fixed-pitch font you can substitute for
      the one supplied with Microsoft Mail. This font serves as an
      alternative to the Microsoft Mail default (Helvetica 10 point).
      This entry affects only the message body text, not the message
      envelope text or folder lists. In Microsoft Mail, the default is
      Courier New, 9, 0, 0 (Courier New, 9-point, not bold, not
      italic).
</PRE>
<LI>NormalFont=&lt;facename&gt;, &lt;size&gt;, &lt;0&gt;|&lt;1&gt;, &lt;0&gt;|&lt;1&gt;
<P>
<P><PRE>      This value identifies the proportionally spaced default font
      used to display Mail messages. This entry affects only the
      message body text, not the message envelope text or folder
      lists. The default value is Helv, 10, 0, 0.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      NOTE: To switch between the normal font and the fixed font,
      choose Change Font from the View menu.
</PRE>
<LI>PrintFont=&lt;facename&gt;, &lt;size&gt;, &lt;0&gt;|&lt;1&gt;, &lt;0&gt;|&lt;1&gt;
<P>
<P><PRE>      This value identifies the default proportionally spaced font
      used to print Mail messages. The default value is Helv, 10, 0, 0.
</PRE><P>
</UL><h2>CHANGING MOUSE BEHAVIOR</h2>
 

<UL><LI>If you have difficulty controlling the Microsoft Mouse, you can
   adjust its speed in the Mouse dialog box of Control Panel.

<LI>If you have trouble double-clicking the mouse, you can adjust the
   sensitivity using the Double-Click Speed setting in the Mouse
   dialog box of Control Panel.

<LI>If you have trouble positioning the mouse on window frames so that
   you can adjust the size of the windows, you can increase the window
   border width setting in the Desktop dialog box of Control Panel.

<LI>If you have trouble locating the pointer on the screen, you can
   modify its appearance from the Cursors section of Control Panel.
   You can choose larger, animated, or different colored cursors.
<P>
</UL><h2>CHANGING KEYBOARD BEHAVIOR</h2>
 

<UL><LI>If you have trouble using the keyboard because of the speed at
   which it repeats or the delay time before it begins repeating, you
   can adjust these settings in the Keyboard dialog box of Control
   Panel.

<LI>You can use two methods to reduce the number of keystrokes required
   to switch between applications. You can use Task List to display a
   list of all applications currently running, or you can assign a
   shortcut key to each application. Task List can be invoked by
   pressing CTRL+ESC, or by choosing Switch To from any application's
   Control menu. Application shortcut keys can be assigned by creating
   an icon for the application in Program Manager and using the
   Properties command on the File menu. For more information on Task
   List and shortcut keys, see the Microsoft Windows NT "System
   Guide."
<P>
   NOTE: Application shortcut keys work only when Program Manager is
   the active application. You can create a shortcut key for Program
   Manager by adding Program Manager to your Startup group and
   assigning it a shortcut key from the Properties dialog box.
