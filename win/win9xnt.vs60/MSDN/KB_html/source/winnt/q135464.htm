The following error messages are added to your domain controller's system
log (as seen with the Event Viewer) approximately every 12 minutes:

Event Log information:
<PRE>   Date:       6/14/95       Event ID:  8003
   Time:       12:12:00 PM   Source:    Rdr
   User:       N/A           Type:      Error
   Computer:   MyPDC         Category:  None

   Description:
      The master browser has received a server announcement from the
      computer MyBDC that believes that it is the master browser
      for the domain on transport NetBT_NETFLX1. The master browser is
      stopping or an election is being forced.

   Data: Words
      0000: 00000000 004a0003 00000000 c0001f43
      0010: 00000000 00000000 0000055a 00000000
      0020: 00000000 00000000

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Routers on your network are configured to forward UDP broadcasts.
<P>
If a Windows NT domain spans more than one subnet and the TCP/IP protocol
(NetBT) is used, each subnet will have a Master Browser. If a Master
Browser receives server announcements from another computer, claiming to be
a Master Browser, an election is forced to ensure that there is only one
Master Browser per subnet. These browser elections cause the 8003 message
to be recorded.
<P>
If the routers on the network are configured to forward UDP broadcasts to
UDP ports 137 and 138, then the election broadcasts that are intended to
remain in the subnet are forwarded to other subnets.
<P>
This has also been seen with bridges or switches between two dissimilar
network segments within the same subnet.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To stop the 8003 error messages, make sure the routers on the network are
not forwarding UDP broadcasts, keeping browser elections on NetBT local to
each subnet.
