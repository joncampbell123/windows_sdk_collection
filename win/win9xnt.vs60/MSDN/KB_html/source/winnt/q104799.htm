The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Storage Dimensions SCSI Host adapters are manufactured by the
BusLogic Corporation, even though Storage Dimensions sells the
adapters with their own brand name. Therefore, if you have a Storage
Dimensions SCSI host adapter, the adapter may work correctly under
Windows NT provided Windows NT Setup identifies the card as a member
of the BusLogic family of adapters.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
According to Storage Dimensions, the following Storage Dimensions SCSI
host adapters appear to work correctly under Windows NT:

<UL><LI>SDC3222F (for EISA architecture computers)
<LI>SDC3222B (for EISA architecture computers)
<LI>SDC3211F (SCSI II for MCA architecture computers)
<LI>SDC3211B (SCSI II for MCA architecture computers)
<P>
</UL>The letter designation of "F" in the model number represents the "SCSI
II FAST" interface. This interface has a data transfer rate of up to
10 MBs (megabytes per second). The letter designation of "B"
represents the "SCSI II" interface. This interface has a data transfer
rate of up to 5 MBs.
<P>
Because these Storage Dimensions SCSI host adapter cards do not
actually appear on the Windows NT Hardware Compatibility List,
Microsoft cannot guarantee that they will work correctly with Windows
NT.
<P>
The Storage Dimensions cards with model numbers SDC1602F and SDC1602B
have not yet been tested with Windows NT. This article will be updated
when this information becomes available.
<P>
The Storage Dimensions SCSI products included here are manufactured by
vendors independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or
otherwise, regarding these products' performance or reliability.
