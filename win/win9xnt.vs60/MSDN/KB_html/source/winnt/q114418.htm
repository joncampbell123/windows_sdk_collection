<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Windows NT Workstation and Windows NT Server version 3.5 contain
code that Adaptec AHA154x SCSI controllers use to detect BIOS conflicts
with other network or video adapters.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
BIOS conflicts are sometimes interpreted as driver problems. The driver
uses the Adaptec code to report to the system where its BIOS appears in
memory, and the system uses this information to detect conflicts with other
cards.
<P>
When a conflict is detected, it may appear as though the driver caused the
conflict because your computer performed normally before the conflict was
detected or still does in MS-DOS. This is deceiving because many problems
caused by BIOS conflicts are subtle and not noticed for months of
operation. Following are some of the more noticeable symptoms:

<UL><LI>A warm reboot causes the AHA154x to "go away."
<LI>The floppy drive doesn't work reliably, even on systems that use an
   internal non-Adaptec floppy controller.
<LI>The video driver's colors are incorrect.
<LI>Network transfer causes data corruption.
<P>
</UL>Detected BIOS conflicts are described in the event log, and conflicting
cards are identified. Use the vendor's manual to adjust BIOS locations and
eliminate conflicts.
<P>
The AHA154x line of SCSI controllers manufactured by Adaptec, a vendor
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise,
regarding this product's performance or reliability.
