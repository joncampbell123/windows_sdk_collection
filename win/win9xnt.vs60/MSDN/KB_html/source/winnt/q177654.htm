The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information on how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" online Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry
Key" online Help topic in Regedt32.exe.
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Your network performance seems to slow down and may actually stop in some
instances. You are using the NetBEUI protocol with your Windows NT
computers.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Network performance can decrease because of the frequency and time interval
the Logical Link Control (LLC) POLL frames are sent. When LLC POLL frames
are not answered, NetBEUI starts resending these frames. Depending on the
circumstances, the first LLC POLL frame is sent after +/- 400 ms (a
hardcoded value for MinimumT1Timeout), thereafter increasing the time
between LLC POLL frames.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Obtain the following fix or wait for the next Windows NT service pack.
<P>
This fix should have the following timestamp:
<P>
<PRE>   10/27/97  08:19 PM               100,112 Nbf.sys (Intel)
   10/27/97  08:17 PM               183,312 Nbf.sys (Alpha)

</PRE>NOTE: Service Pack 3 must be applied to Windows NT 4.0 prior to applying
this fix.
<P>
After obtaining the fix mentioned above, then you will need to edit the
registry using the following steps:
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor
can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and
Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" online Help
topics in Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before
you edit it.

<OL><P><LI>Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe or Regedit.exe).

<P><LI>Go to the following subkey:
<P>
<P><PRE>      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Nbf\Parameters
</PRE>
<P><LI>Create a new value with the following information:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Value name: MinimumT1Timeout
      Data type : REG_DWORD
      Default:  8 (decimal) (which equals 400 milliseconds)
</PRE><P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0.
A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression tested
and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem.
Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix.
Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In the following trace you can see the time intervals (measured as seconds
from previous frame):
<P>
<PRE>   1  0.000 LLC       RR DSAP=0xF0 SSAP=0xF1 R N(R) = 0x04 FINAL
   2  1.772 LLC       RR DSAP=0xF0 SSAP=0xF0 C N(R) = 0x04 POLL
   3  0.450 LLC       RR DSAP=0xF0 SSAP=0xF0 C N(R) = 0x04 POLL
   4  0.651 LLC       RR DSAP=0xF0 SSAP=0xF0 C N(R) = 0x04 POLL
   5  0.952 LLC       RR DSAP=0xF0 SSAP=0xF0 C N(R) = 0x04 POLL
   6  1.402 LLC       RR DSAP=0xF0 SSAP=0xF0 C N(R) = 0x04 POLL

</PRE></OL>This causes increased network traffic and LLC POLL frames from other
Stations could timeout (router overload) increasing the overall number of
LLC POLL frames, which can finally lead to severe bridge problems.
