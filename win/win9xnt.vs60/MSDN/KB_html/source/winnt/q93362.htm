<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
C2 refers to a set of security policies that define how a secure system
operates. The C2 evaluation process is separate from the C2 certification
process. As of August, 1995, National Security Agency (NSA) granted the C2
security rating for Windows NT Server and Workstation versions 3.5 and
3.51. As a result these operating systems are on the Evaluated Products
List (EPL).
<P>
NOTE: This does not mean that Windows NT is C2 certified (no operating
system is ever C2 certified). Certification applies to a particular
installation, including hardware, software, and the environment that the
system is in. It is up to an individual site to become C2 certified.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The requirements for A-, B-, C-, and D-level secure products are outlined
in the Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC) published by the
National Computer Security Center (NCSC). This publication is referred to
as the "Orange Book," and is part of NSA's security "rainbow series."
Security level requirements are open to interpretations that change over
time. When undergoing evaluation, each vendor negotiates with the NSA about
whether or not the details of its particular system implementation conform
with the abstract security policy concepts in the NSA's books. The vendor
must provide evidence that the requirements are being met.
<P>
Microsoft has opted not to include certain components of NT in the
evaluation process, not because they would not pass the evaluation, but to
save time by reducing the load on the NSA. Additionally, the MS-
DOS/Windows on Windows (WOW) system may be treated as a Win32 application
and would therefore not need to be evaluated as part of the Trusted
Computer Base (TCB). Networking on NT may not have to go through the "Red
Book," or "Trusted Network Interpretation." It may be enough to consider
networking to be another subsystem, and therefore only the Orange Book
would apply. New or modified components and other hardware platforms can go
through a "RAMP" process to be included in the evaluation at a later time.
<P>
<P><h3>C2 Overview</h3>
 
<P>
The security policy in C2 is known as Discretionary Access Control (DAC).
In the Windows NT implementation, the basic idea is that users of the
system:

<UL><LI>Own objects
<LI>Have control over the protection of the objects they own
<LI>Are accountable for all their access-related actions
<P>
</UL>C2 classification does not define a substantive security system in the
sense of classified or unclassified data. (B-level security assumes the
existence of an independent security classification system and enforces
that system, but does not specify the substance of the classification
system.)
<P>
For example, in Windows NT, every object (file, Clipboard, window, and so
on) has an owner; any owner can give or not give other users access to its
objects. The system tracks (audits) your actions for the administrators
(that is, the system administrator can track the objects you accessed, both
successes and failures).
<P>
The key distinction between C-level and B-level security is in the notion
of access control. In a C2 (DAC) system, owners have absolute discretion
about whether or not others have access to their objects. In a B-level, or
Mandatory Access Control (MAC) system, objects have a security level
defined independently from the owner's discretion. For example, if you
receive a copy of an object marketed "secret," you can't give permission to
other users to see this object unless they have "secret" clearance. This is
defined by the system independent of your discretion. MAC involves the
concept of "data labeling," which is the creation and maintenance by the
system of security "labels" on data objects, unalterable by users (except
in certain cases under system control and auditing). An administrator can
get access to anyone's objects, although it may require some programming to
do so (that is, the user interface won't expose this power).
