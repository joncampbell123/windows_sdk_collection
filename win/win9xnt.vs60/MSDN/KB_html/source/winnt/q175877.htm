The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0
</UL>

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use Client Services for NetWare (CSNW) or Gateway Services for
NetWare (GSNW) to connect to a NetWare server and you are running a logon
script or manually invoking a 16-bit application on a NetWare server, you
may receive the following error when you attempt to log back on:
<P>
<PRE>   NetWare Authentication Failure

   You cannot be authenticated on &lt;NetWare Tree and Context&gt; due to the
   following reason: A connection to the server could not be made because
   the limit on the number of concurrent connections for this account has
   been reached.

   Do you want to select another preferred server or context?

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The NetWare server has Limit Concurrent Connections for your user account
set to 1. When the client logs off after running the 16-bit application,
the connection on the NetWare server is not closed. This results in an
unlicensed connection on the NetWare server. The connections are cleaned up
if the user shuts down and restarts the server before logging back on.
<P>
NOTE: You can determine if a connection is unlicensed by going to the
NetWare server, loading monitor, and then selecting the active connection
list. Unlicensed connections will have and asterisk (*) in front of the
user name.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
You can work around this problem by performing any of the following:

<UL><LI>Set the concurrent connections for your user account to a higher value
   on the NetWare server.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Shut down and restart the workstation after each use.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Obtain the corrected binary Winsrv.dll hotfix mentioned below or wait
   for the next service pack.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0.
A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression tested
and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem.
Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix.
Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
