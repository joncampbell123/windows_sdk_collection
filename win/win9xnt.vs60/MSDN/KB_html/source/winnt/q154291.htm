<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Windows NT supports the central installation of printer drivers for various
client platforms. These include MIPS, Alpha, Power PC, and also Windows 95
clients. This article describes how to do this for Windows NT 4.0.
<P>
For information about the correct process for Windows NT 3.x, please see
the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : Cross Platform Network Printing with Windows NT

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The process has been simplified in Windows NT 4.0. After installing a
shared printer in Windows NT 4.0, you can add additional platform drivers
by following these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Double-click the My Computer icon.

<P><LI>Double-click the Printers icon.

<P><LI>Right-click the printer icon and click Properties.

<P><LI>Click the Sharing tab.

<P><LI>In the Alternate Drivers box, you will see a list of various versions
   and platforms of Windows NT as well as Windows 95. Any driver that is
   already installed will be marked as such.

<P><LI>Click the platform of the driver you wish to add and click OK.

<P><LI>You will be prompted for the path to the appropriate driver.

<P><LI>You should now see the driver being copied onto the server.

<P><LI>In the case of Windows 95 drivers, you will either need to point the
   server to the Windows directory of an existing computer running Windows
   95 that has that print driver already loaded, or you can do the
   following:
<P>
   a. Extract the Windows 95 cabinet files into a location accessible to
<P><PRE>      the Windows NT server. The cabinet files needed are Precopy2.cab,
      Win95_09.cab, and Win95_10.cab.
</PRE><P>
   b. Presuming that your Windows 95 compact disc is in drive D, and you
<P><PRE>      are extracting the files to a directory called C:\w95print, the
      commands to do this are:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>      i.    c:
      ii.   md \w95print
      iii.  cd \w95print
      iv.   d:\win95\extract.exe /e d:\win95\precopy2.cab *.*
      v.    d:\win95\extract.exe /e d:\win95\win95_09.cab *.*
      vi.   d:\win95\extract.exe /e d:\win95\win95_10.cab *.*

   c. Use c:\w95print as the path to load the Windows 95 drivers. When you
      view this directory, there will be 116 .inf files and you will need
      to select the correct one. To view a list of the printer drivers,
      point to the Msprint.inf file.

      NOTE: You may also be prompted for the files from win95_11.cab,
      depending on the Windows 95 installation source and which printer is
      being installed. If so, use the following command to extract the
      files to the same location as above:

         d:\win95\extract.exe /e d:\win95\win95_11.cab *.*
