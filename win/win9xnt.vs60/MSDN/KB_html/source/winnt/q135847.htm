<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you open a file in Microsoft Word or Microsoft Excel from a computer
running Windows NT and Client Services for NetWare (CSNW), and the file is
located on a NetWare server, the file loads 1000 percent slower than it
does when accessed on a Windows for Workgroups client computer.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs on Windows NT clients using NCP burst mode to load
files stored on NetWare 3.12 servers in a multiple route WAN environment.
<P>
If, during a burst of several fragments, a fragment is received in the
wrong order or a fragment is dropped, CSNW requests the missing fragment be
retransmitted. This is usually handled very quickly. However, if two
fragments are sent and the second fragment arrives first, Windows NT CSNW
(NWRDR.SYS) sees that the NCP offset is not zero and discards the fragment
(packet). When the first fragment arrives, Windows NT then waits
approximately one second for the second fragment to arrive before timing
out and requesting that the second fragment be retransmitted.
<P>
The problem is due to the routers configuration.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this problem, install the fix mentioned below.
<P>
Set the MAXPATH router configuration parameter to 1. This ensures that only
one network path is used to route NCP burst mode packets.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.5 and
3.51. This problem was corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Windows NT Workstation or Server version 3.51. For information on obtaining
