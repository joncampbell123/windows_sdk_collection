The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
A DHCP client may fail to obtain a DHCP lease if multiple logical subnets
exist and there is a Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 2 (SP2) DHCP server on the
network. Also, you may receive the following error message when you run the
IPCONFIG /RENEW command:
<P>
<PRE>   Access Denied - Renewing Adapter "xxxx"

</PRE>Prior to Service Pack 2, when multiple logical subnets existed, the DHCP
client was able to receive the DHCPOFFER and send a DHCPREQUEST to the
offering DHCP server. After applying Service Pack 2, the DHCP servers on
other logical subnets issue a DHCPNACK, which forces the client to release
the address and perform a DHCPDISCOVER again.
<P>
In addition to the above error message, you may receive the following event
log messages:
<P>
<P><h3>On the Client</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   Event ID: 1006
   Source: Dhcp
   Type: Warning
   Category: None
   Description: DHCP service is shutting down. The following error
                occurred: Access is denied.

</PRE><h3>On the Server</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   Event ID: 1011
   Source: DhcpServer
   Type: Warning
   Category: None
   Description: The DHCP server issued a NACK to the client (MAC Address of
                the Requesting Client) for the address (Requested IP
                Address) request.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Windows NT 4.0 SP2 DHCP servers issue a DHCPNACK to any DHCPREQUEST that
does not appear to be valid for the subnet. This problem occurs when you
are using multiple logical IP subnets (multinetting) and two DHCP servers
on the same physical network are serving two different logical subnets.
<P>
For example, a client broadcasts DHCPREQUEST and receives ACK from server A
and NACK from server B. Because there is no communication between server B
and server A, server B is not aware of the existence of server A. If it
does not send a NACK, then a client who has just moved to this network will
never know that its old address is invalid.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this issue, obtain the following fix or wait for the next
Windows NT service pack.
<P>
This fix should have the following timestamp:
<PRE>   06/20/97  07:33 PM               116,496 Dhcpssvc.dll (Intel)
   06/20/97  06:32 PM               185,104 Dhcpssvc.dll (Alpha)

</PRE>NOTE: Service Pack 3 must be applied to Windows NT 4.0 prior to applying
this fix.
<P>
To workaround this issue, use one of the following:

<UL><LI>Windows NT 4.0 SP2 includes the ability to create DHCP superscopes.
   After creating a scope and defining each logical subnet in a superscope,
   the DHCP server recognizes the DHCPREQUEST as valid and will not NACK
   the request.
<P>
   For example, you have a multinet environment with the following DHCP
   servers on a single LAN:
<P>
<P><PRE>      192.168.10.1
      192.168.20.1
      192.168.30.1
</PRE><P>
   On each DHCP server you must create a superscope with a minimum of one
   IP address from each of the 10.x, 20.x and 30.x scopes. Be sure not to
   duplicate IP addresses in the scopes.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Another possibility is to take advantage of the superscoping feature and
   create one DHCP server to serve all scopes.
<P>
</UL>For more information on superscopes, please see the following article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : Using DHCP "Superscopes" to Serve Multiple Logical Subnets

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0.
A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested
and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem.
Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix.
Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
