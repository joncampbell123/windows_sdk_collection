<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
You may experience an increase in replication occurrences as a result of
ANNOUNCE_IMMEDIATE events.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Security account manager (SAM) and local security authority (LSA)
replication can fall into a number of categories, including immediate
(or urgent) replication. Most replication handled by the Net Logon service
occurs at set intervals, but certain types of account or policy changes
are considered urgent and must be handled immediately, causing an
ANNOUNCE_IMMEDIATE event to be generated and acted upon by the primary
domain controller (PDC). The following replications are considered urgent:

<UL><LI>Changing the account lockout policy.

<LI>Changing the domain password policy.

<LI>Changing the password on a machine account.

<LI>Replicating a newly locked-out account.

<LI>Changing an LSA secret (essentially the "trusting" side of changing
   the machine account password).
<P>
</UL>These changes are immediate by necessity. For example, if a workstation
were to change its machine account password and then lose its connection
to its domain controller, it would not be able to connect to any other
domain controller until the replication occurred.
<P>
As a part of Windows NT security, machine account passwords are changed
every seven days. As a side effect of this automatic machine account
password change, a domain with a large number of computers and domain
controllers may cause replication to occur on a frequent basis.
<P>
Some administrators may want to disable these automatic machine account
password changes. For information about how to disable automatic machine
account password changes, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
