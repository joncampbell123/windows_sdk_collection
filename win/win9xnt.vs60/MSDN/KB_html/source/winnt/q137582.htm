<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Winscl.exe is a command line administrative tool for managing Windows
Internet Name Service (WINS) servers. This tool is available in the Windows
NT 3.51 and 4.0 Resource Kits. This article includes several tips for using
Winscl.exe.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 

<UL><LI>The WINS Server must be running to modify the WINS database with
   Winscl.exe.

<LI>WINSCL does not run under Windows NT 3.5.

<LI>You must have administrative permission to administer a WINS database.
   If you run WINSCL from an untrusted domain, you must have a user name
   and password that matches an administrative account on that domain.

<LI>WINSCL is case sensitive. The commands must be entered in upper-case,
   and NetBIOS names must match those that appear in the WINS database
   exactly.

<LI>Many commands give you a choice to enter 1 to select an option. You can
   enter 0 to choose the other option. For example, when you first start
   WINSCL you see:
<P>
<P><PRE>      TCP/IP or named pipe. Enter 1 for TCP/IP --
</PRE><P>
   You can enter 0 to select named pipe.

<LI>WINSCL may indicate that a command was successful, such as when you add
   or delete a WINS entry. You should Refresh and view the WINS database
   and verify that the command was carried out successfully. There is no
   indication when a command fails.

<LI>When removing WINS database entries, you must individually remove all
   the names that a computer may register. For example, a typical Windows
   client computer named "CHARLIE" would register three names, CHARLIE[00],
   CHARLIE[20], and CHARLIE[03]. To totally remove CHARLIE from the
   database, you must specifically remove all three names. The sixteenth
   character in the [] brackets is what differentiates the three names.
<P>
</UL>To use WINSCL to delete dynamic WINS entries, use the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Type the following command and then press Enter.
<P>
<P><PRE>      WINSCL T
</PRE><P>
   WINSCL prompts you for the IP address of the server running WINS.

<P><LI>Enter the WINS server's IP address and then press Enter.

<P><LI>Type the following command and then press Enter.
<P>
<P><PRE>      DN &lt;ComputerName&gt;
</PRE><P>
   where ComputerName is the name of the computer you wish to remove.
<P>
   WINSCL prompts you to enter 1 to select a 16th character. Enter a 1 and
   the NetBIOS registration that you wish to remove. DO NOT include any
   backslashes ('\\'), enter only the NetBIOS name. Each registration must
   be removed separately.

<P><LI>Type the following command and then press Enter.
<P>
<P><PRE>      1
</OL></PRE>5. Type the following command and then press Enter.
<P>
<PRE>      1B

   WINSCL prompts you for a scope. Enter 0.

</PRE><P><LI>Type the following command and then press Enter.
<P>
<P><PRE>      0
</PRE><P>
</OL>The entry has been removed from the WINS database. Refresh the WINS manager
and verify the entry has been deleted.
