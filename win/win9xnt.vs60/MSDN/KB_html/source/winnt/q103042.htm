The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
When you start a Windows NT Advanced Server 3.1 computer, you may
receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   At Least One Service or Driver Failed During System Startup. Use
   Event Viewer to Examine the Event Log for Details.

</PRE>In the Event Viewer, there may be the following event message from the
Browser service:
<P>
<PRE>   The browser has forced an election on network \Device\Nbf_Lance01
   because a Windows NT Advanced Server (or domain master) browser is
   started.

</PRE>If this error message is present, it means that there was no browse
master available at the time you started the computer. Therefore, the
Browser service forced an election (of a Browsemaster) on the network.
The error message is harmless and should be ignored.
<P>
This message occurs on a Windows NT Advanced Server computer if that
computer is the only domain controller for that domain. You will
receive this error message each time you start up this computer. The
Windows NT Advanced Server computer has a higher priority than any
other computers, such as Windows for Workgroups computers, so it was
chosen as the browse master.
