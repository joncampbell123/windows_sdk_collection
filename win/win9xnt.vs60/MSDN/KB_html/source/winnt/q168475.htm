The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article details how to create a "base" or Default User profile for all
users and how to place it on the Netlogon share. It is important to note
that this will only work for users that have a new user ID in a Windows NT
4.0 domain and have not logged on with it before.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Windows NT 4.0 follows the following discovery process for creating a new
profile:

<UL><LI>Is there a central (roaming) profile defined in User Manager for
   Domains?

<LI>If yes, does the profile exist? If yes, use profile.

<LI>If no, does this user have a local profile? If yes, use local.

<LI>If no, does Default User exist on Netlogon share of validating Domain
   Controller? If yes, use it.

<LI>If no, does Default User exist in WinNT\Profiles?
<P>
</UL>Follow these steps to create a Default User:

<OL><P><LI>Log on to a workstation as a generic user (one that does not have
   Administrator rights in the domain). Set up your desktop and change the
   settings that you want to change. Log off the workstation. The profile
   is actually created at this point.

<P><LI>Log back onto the workstation as someone who has Administrator rights to
   the local computer, as well as in the domain. In the System tool in
   Control Panel, click the User Profiles tab. Select the user's profile
   that you created in the previous step.

<P><LI>Click Copy To, which will bring up a dialog box that allows you to
   specify where the profile is going to be copied, as well as being able
   to specify who is Permitted to Use this profile. To create the Default
   User Profile (base profile) you should permit the group Everyone to be
   able to use the profile. Next, in the blank box where it states Copy
   To:, specify the server name and the share name, as well as the name of
   the profile that you want to copy this profile to.
<P>
   It should be in this format:
<P>
<P><PRE>      \\Servername\Sharename\Profilename.
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: The name of the profile will actually be a directory name and the
   entire directory and its subdirectories and files are the entire
   profile.

<P><LI>Copy this profile to the Netlogon share and rename the profile to
   Default User. This will enable Windows NT to create a new profile based
   on this profile for a user who does not already have a central or local
   profile.
<P>
   NOTE: This Default User profile will be used to create new Roaming
   Profiles as well as new local profiles.
<P></OL>
