<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
Windows NT Setup copies setup information files designed for the media
Setup is running from. If you install Windows NT from floppy disks,
setup information files containing directions and disk numbers for
floppy disks are copied to your hard disk drive. If you later need to
use files from a CD-ROM disc, Windows NT Setup prompts you for floppy
disks.
<P>
You can change the source media for a given device driver or Windows
NT component by copying the appropriate setup information file to your
Windows NT \SYSTEM32 subdirectory. In this manner, you can install new
device drivers and components from any media you choose.
<P>
The names and locations of the setup information files you need are
listed later in this article in the section titled "Setup Information
Filenames, Descriptions, and Locations." The following example
describes how to install a new pointing device or mouse driver.
<P>
<P><h2>INSTALLING A NEW MOUSE DRIVER FROM FLOPPY DISKS</h2>
 
<P>
To install a new pointing device or mouse driver from floppy disks
after installing Windows NT Advanced Server from a compact disc, use
the following procedure:
<P>
NOTE: To install a different type of device or component, see the
following section, "Setup Information Filenames, Descriptions, and
Locations." Substitute the appropriate filename and disk for
POINTER.IN_ and "Disk 2" respectively.

<OL><P><LI>Insert the disk labeled "Disk 2" from the Microsoft Windows NT
   Advanced Server 3.1 disk set.

<P><LI>Start Command Prompt from the Main group in Program Manager.

<P><LI>Go to the \SYSTEM32 subdirectory.

<P><LI>Substitute the appropriate floppy disk drive letter for &lt;floppy
   disk drive&gt; in the following command line:
<P>
<P><PRE>      expand &lt;floppy disk drive&gt;:\pointer.in_ pointer.inf
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: Some information files are not compressed and do not need to be
   expanded. For example, the PRINTER.INF file is not compressed. If this
   is the case, substitute the COPY command for EXPAND.

<P><LI>Start Setup to install the new device driver as you would usually
   do.
<P>
</OL>You are now prompted for the appropriate floppy disk instead of a CD-
ROM disc.
<P>
SETUP INFORMATION FILENAMES, DESCRIPTIONS, AND LOCATIONS
 
<P>
Setup information files are listed by file name and include short
descriptions and disk locations. The disk locations are listed for
both Windows NT and Windows NT Advanced Server, in that order.
<P>
NOTE: If you want to install a device driver from a CD-ROM disc after
having installed Windows NT from floppy disks, copy the appropriate
setup information file from the CD-ROM disc.
