<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51 and 4.0
<LI>Microsoft File and Print Services for NetWare version 4.0

<P>
IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the Novell NetWare Windows utility, Nwuser.exe, to send
messages to and from Novell clients, the message is truncated to
approximately 38 characters (NWUSER permits up to 255 characters.) This
behavior is different than the Novell DOS client's Send.exe utility, which
permits only up to 55 characters.
<P>
