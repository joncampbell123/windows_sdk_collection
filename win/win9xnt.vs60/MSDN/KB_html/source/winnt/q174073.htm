   TITLE     : Security Event Descriptions

</PRE><h3>Security Identifiers (SIDs)</h3>
 
<P>
Some security events report SIDs instead of user names. In this case,
it is often difficult to determine which user account is being referred
to in the event.
<P>
It is possible to build a list of mappings of user names to SIDs by
performing the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Dump the user list to a text file with the NET USERS command or with
   Addusers.exe.

<P><LI>Modify this text file to remove unwanted information (headers, and so
   forth).

<P><LI>Modify the resulting list of user names into a batch file, using the
   GETSID resource kit utility to translate each user name into a SID.
   Redirect the output to a text file.

<P><LI>When you encounter a SID, search the text file (created previously)
   for that SID. This will place you on the line with the user's name.
<P>
</OL><h3>Logon Type</h3>
 
"Logon Type" will be one of the following:
<PRE>   2  Interactive
   3  Network
   4  Batch
   5  Service
   6  Proxy
   7  Unlock Workstation
   (0 &amp; 1 are invalid)

</PRE></OL><h3>Logon Process</h3>
 
"Logon Process" will be one of the following:
<P>
<PRE>  "msv1_0" or "MICROSOFT_AUTHENTICATION_PACKAGE_V1_0":
     msv1_0.dll, the default authentication package

  "KSecDD":
     ksecdd.sys, the security device driver

  "User32" or "WinLogon\MSGina":
     winlogon.exe &amp; msgina.dll, the authentication user interface

  "SCMgr":
     The Service Control Manager

  "LAN Manager Workstation Service"

  "advapi"
   API call to LogonUser

</PRE><h3>User Rights</h3>
