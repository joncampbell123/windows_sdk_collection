<P>
<P><h2>1.0  Removing Previous Versions</h2>
 
<P>
If you have installed a prerelease version of the upgrade product, you
should delete it before installing this version. Move to the UPGRADE
directory and delete all files.
<P>
In addition, remove *.ACL files from the directory &lt;LANROOT&gt;\ACCOUNTS. This
ensures that the Windows NT Advanced Server Upgrade Manager uses the
correct *.ACL files to assign file permissions.
<P>
<P><h2>2.0 General Upgrade Issues</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>2.1  Set Svrhidden to No Before Upgrading</h3>
 
Before upgrading a server, make sure the srvhidden parameter in LANMAN.INI
is set to no. If svrhidden is yes, the LAN Manager Upgrade Manager cannot
correctly verify the synchronization state of domain servers, as described
in item 2.3. If svrhidden is yes, change it to no and then stop and restart
the server service.
<P>
<P><h3>2.2  Home Directories That Are UNC Names</h3>
 
LAN Manager supports UNC paths for user home directories (e.g.,
TEST\LAN\USERS\FK) while Windows NT requires logical path names
(K:\USERS\FK). Because the upgrade does not convert UNC paths to logical
paths, users with UNC path home directories may be unable to log on after
upgrading to Windows NT Advanced Server. To give these users full access,
change their home directories to a logical path names before or after
upgrading. For the latest status on this problem, contact Microsoft Support
Services.
<P>
<P><h3>2.3  Synchronizing Accounts Prior to Upgrading</h3>
 
Upgrading when user accounts are not synchronized can result in creation of
a NETACC.BKP file that contains incorrect information. To prevent this, the
LAN Manager Upgrade Manager automatically checks for synchronization, as
follows:
<P>
a) For LAN Manager primary domain controllers, the LAN Manager Upgrade
<PRE>   Manager checks to see that user accounts on backup domain controllers
   and member servers are synchronized with the primary domain controller.
   If accounts are not synchronized, the Upgrade Manager starts
   synchronization and then rechecks status once a minute for 10 minutes.
   If ynchronization is not complete after 10 minutes, the Upgrade Manager
   offers the option of exiting or stopping the Net Logon service and
   continuing the upgrade.

</PRE>b) If you run the LAN Manager Upgrade Manager on a member or backup domain
<PRE>   controller and the primary domain controller is not already a Windows NT
   Advanced Server, the Upgrade Manager verifies that the local UAS is
   synchronized with the primary domain controller. If not, it initiates
   synchronization as described in the previous paragraph.

</PRE>c) If you run the LAN Manager Upgrade Manager on a backup domain controller
<PRE>   or member server and the domain controller is a Windows NT Advanced
   Server, synchronization is not checked.

</PRE>The LAN Manager Upgrade Manager only checks for synchronization on servers
that are running LAN Manager version 2.1 and above. Note that if the Net
Logon service is stopped on one of the servers in the domain, the Upgrade
Manager will report an error during its synchronization attempt and then
continue with the upgrade (if Net Logon is not running on the specific
machine being upgraded, error 2453 is shown).
<P>
<P><h3>2.4  Running Acllist on Drives with Large Numbers of Files</h3>
 
Acllist can cause excessive paging on disks containing large numbers of
files and/or directories. For example, on a LAN Manager server with 16 MB,
swapping activity occurs if a combination of more than 29,000 files and
directories exist. To avoid this problem, run acllist specifying one or
more root-level subdirectories, instead of a drive. For example, type
"acllist c:\programs c:\projects /a" to collect file information for the
PROGRAMS and PROJECTS directory trees and place it in a single ACLLIST.DAT
file. (/a appends PROJECT directory information to the ACLLIST.DAT.) Note
that this acllist option is not documented in the Upgrade Guide and is not
available from the LAN Manager Upgrade Manager.
<P>
<P><h3>2.5  Using Hcopy or Xcopy to Restore Files</h3>
 
The hcopy utility included with the upgrade can be used to back up files to
another LAN Manager server and then to restore files under Windows NT
Advanced Server. Using hcopy is important if you want to preserve hidden
files and extended file attributes (extended attributes are required to
upgrade Macintosh volumes). Hcopy is run from a LAN Manager server using
the following options:
<P>
<PRE>   /f  - ensure destination partition supports extended attributes
   /e - copy empty directories
   /v - verify transfer
   /s - copy subdirectories

</PRE>The Windows NT xcopy command can also be used to restore files. (Xcopy
automatically preserves extended attributes.) Use the following options to
restore files using xcopy:
<P>
<PRE>   /e - copy subdirectories, including empty ones
   /f - display source and destination filenames while copying
   /h - copy files with hidden and system attributes
   /k - copy attributes (read-only, archive, etc.)

</PRE>Note that after using Hcopy to transfer directories to a clone, the aclcomp
utility reports a mismatch in directory creation time. This reflects the
difference between actual directory creation time under LAN Manager and the
time it was copied to the clone.
<P>
<P><h3>2.6  Upgrading File Replication Settings</h3>
 
To retain LAN Manager file replication settings under Windows NT Advanced
Server, you must create a special service account on the Windows NT
Advanced Server Domain Controller (DC).
<P>
If the Windows NT Advanced Server (to be upgraded) is aware of this service
account, the restenv utility will restore file replication. Otherwise, file
replication configuration is not preserved.
<P>
To create a service account, log onto an account with Administrative
privileges. If this is the first server to be upgraded with file
replication, perform steps 1 through 8 on the Domain Controller. On the
remaining servers in the domain, complete steps 4 through 8. Perform these
steps prior to running the Windows NT Advanced Server Upgrade Manager on
the server you are upgrading.

<OL><P><LI>Run the User Manager from the Administrative Tools group on the Server
   designated as the Domain Controller (DC).

<P><LI>Create a new user account for replication (name this account using the
<PRE>   'Logon =' parameter located in the LANMAN.INI file). If a password is
   desired, use the 'Password = ' parameter. Remove the check from the
   "User must change password at next logon" check box. Choose Add, then
   Close.

</PRE><P><LI>Choose Exit. Then close User Manager.

<P><LI>Run the Control Panel and select Services.

<P><LI>Choose the Directory Replicator service and choose Startup. Change the
   Startup Type from Manual to Automatic.

<P><LI>In the 'Log On As' control, choose 'This Account'. Then choose Add User.
   Select the Domain Service account created in step 2 above and choose Add
   and then OK.

<P><LI>Type the password for the replication account and choose OK. (Note that
   this is the same password specified in Step 2.) Control Panel responds
   with a message such as "The account DOMAIN\REPL has been granted the Log
   On As A Service right and added to the Replicator local group."

<P><LI>Choose OK to dismiss this message. Choose Close Services.
<P>
</OL>Restenv will automatically start Directory Replication Services. If you
have problems with file replication, refer to item 4 in the file
INTEROP.TXT .
<P>
2.7  Use Convert Utility Included With Windows NT
<PRE>     Advanced Server
</PRE></OL> 
The Upgrade Guide is incorrect in stating that CONVERT.EXE is included on
the upgrade disk. The Windows NT Advanced Server Upgrade Manager converts
partitions using the convert utility included with the operating system.
<P>
<P><h3>2.8  Using Portuas with the /U Option</h3>
 
By default, running portuas adds all LAN Manager groups and users listed in
a specified NETACC.BKP file to an existing Windows NT Advanced Server
security database. To add a single user instead of the entire UAS, you can
use portuas with the /u option. Note, however, that in addition to porting
the specified user, portuas transfers all LAN Manager group names to
Windows NT Advanced Server. For example, typing "portuas netacc.bkp /u
johnh" results in the following:
<P>
a) All groups listed in NETACC.BKP are added to the Windows NT security
<PRE>   database.

</PRE>b) The user "johnh" is added with his group membership preserved.
<P>
c) If the groups or the user "johnh" already exist, portuas overwrites
<PRE>   previous information, which in the case of groups is a remark entry.

</PRE><h3>2.9  Account Expiration Date Set Incorrectly</h3>
 
Portuas sets all user account expiration dates to be 24 hours earlier than
their original LAN Manager settings.
<P>
<P><h3>2.10 Userconv Not Supported on Workstations</h3>
 
It is not possible to map user accounts by running userconv on a Windows NT
Workstation. Userconv runs only on Windows NT Advanced Servers.
<P>
2.11 Aclconv Prompts for File Verification if
<PRE>     Run After Userconv
</PRE> 
By default, the userconv utility creates a file called ACLWORK.DAT for use
by aclconv. If aclconv detects this file, it prompts the user to verify use
of the file to map permissions.
<P>
This verification reduces the likelihood that alconv uses the wrong file to
map permissions. For example, if you run portuas, instead of userconv, it
is not appropriate for aclconv to use ACLWORK.DAT. If ACLWORK.DAT is
present from a previous conversion attempt, aclconv cannot automatically
determine if it is valid.
<P>
<P><h3>2.12 Aclconv User Account Mapping</h3>
 
The Upgrade Guide incorrectly states that Aclconv maps the LAN Manager
ADMIN group to the Windows NT Advanced Server ADMINISTRATOR group. The
correct mapping is as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   LAN Manager Group     Windows NT Group
   -----------------    -----------------
   USERS               USERS
   GUESTS               GUESTS
   ADMINS               ADMINISTRATORS
   ADMIN               ADMIN

</PRE><h3>2.13 Sfmconv Admin Account Mapping</h3>
 
If an Admin account exists under LAN Manager, portuas creates a new account
called "Admin" under Windows NT. Sfmconv, however, maps all Admin
privileges to the "Administrator account." This does effect normal
operation.
<P>
<P><h3>2.14 NBF (NetBEUI) Timeout Settings</h3>
 
Under Windows NT Advanced Server, the following NetBEUI timeout parameters
have a default value of 5,000,000 (units are in 100 nanoseconds):
GeneralTimeout, AddNameQueryTimeout, and NameQueryTimeout. Appendix B of
the Upgrade Guide incorrectly gives their default value as 500,000.
<P>
<P><h3>2.15 Windows NT Backup Issues</h3>
 
When using the Windows NT Backup program supplied with the upgrade, the
following may occur:
<P>
a) Windows NT Backup may have a problem restoring files from a Sytos Plus
<PRE>   tape if the file is in a backup session that spans two Sytos Plus tapes
   and the file itself is entirely on the second tape. If this occurs, you
   can restore the file by rerunning backup after setting the following
   Windows NT Registry key to 0: HKEY_CURRENT_USER
   \Software\Microsoft\Ntbackup\Backup Engine\Use fast file restore. After
   restoring the file, reset the key to 1.

</PRE>b)When restoring or cataloging a Sytos Plus tape under Windows NT, you get
<PRE>   the error "Fatal tape translation error on Tape drive 1" because the
   backup error correction flag value is incorrect in the Registry. To
   correct this problem, edit the following registry key:
   CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Ntbackup\Translators \Sytos Plus ECC
   flag. This value can be 0 for OFF, 1 for ON, or 2 for AUTO. Values
   should be set accordingly:

      4mm Dat    0        1/4 in. 525    0
      8mm Dat    0        1/4 in. 150    1

</PRE>Note that if you have previously run the version of Windows NT Backup
included with Windows NT, delete the Windows NT Backup entries in the
Registry prior to running the upgrade version of Windows NT Backup.
Otherwise, the ECC flag will not appear.
<P>
<P><h3>2.16 Upgrading UPS Command File Setting</h3>
 
LAN Manager and Windows NT Advanced Server differ in the specification of
the UPS Shutdown command file. If the Windows NT Advanced Server UPS
service issues a warning that the UPS command file setting is incorrect,
ensure that the command file is specified as a filename only, with no
preceding path. The exact wording of the warning is "There is a problem
with a configuration of user specified shut down command file. The UPS
service started anyway." The event log will contain a similar entry.
<P>
<P><h2>3.0 Post-Upgrade Issues</h2>
 
<P>
This section discusses post-upgrade steps you can take to ensure that
upgraded servers and domains are fully functional.
<P>
3.1 Checking Permissions for Replication/Logon
<PRE>    Script Directories
</PRE> 
Make sure that permissions for logon scripts and replication directories
are set so that the appropriate users have access to these directories.
<P>
<P><h3>3.2 Synchronizing a Domain After Upgrading</h3>
 
After upgrading, logon scripts will be unavailable to users until user
account replication occurs. To force replication after upgrading:
<P>
1) Select the Windows NT Advanced Server domain controller from the list in
<PRE>   the Server Manager window.

</PRE>2) From the Computer menu, choose Synchronize Entire Domain.
<P>
<P><h3>3.3  Checking for Duplicate Server Accounts</h3>
 
If duplicate server accounts exist in different domains, replication and
trust relationships may function incorrectly. This situation can also cause
the Net Logon service to fail in a LAN Manager domain.
<P>
The following circumstances can result in the creation of duplicate
accounts:
<P>
a) Upgrading a LAN Manager PDC to a Windows NT Advanced Server clone and
<PRE>   leaving the original LAN Manager domain intact. In this scenario,
   portuas creates computer accounts on the clone for each of the LAN
   Manager servers in the original Servers group. Thus, server accounts
   exist in both domains. Typically, this situation prevents LAN Manager
   users from logging on.

</PRE>b) Using Server Manager to create an account for a computer that already
<PRE>   exists in another domain. For example, if you add the computer account
   \\FRISBEE to a Windows NT domain controller, and \\FRISBEE already
   exists in another domain, you will have problems setting up a trust
   relationship between the two domains.

</PRE>To rectify this problem, use User Manager for Domains to delete accounts
for LAN Manager server(s) that exist in another domain.
<P>
<P><h3>3.4 Re-establishing Audit Settings</h3>
 
Audit settings are not ported as part of the upgrade. To restore these
settings under Windows NT, manually configure audit parameters for each
resource previously audited under LAN Manager. Then, specify "Everyone". To
set up auditing, choose Auditing from the Security menu in File Manager.
<P>
Note that if auditing is enabled for LAN Manager, the aclcomp utility will
note which LAN Manager files and directories were audited in the file
ACLCOMP.LOG.
<P>
<P><h2>4.0  Localization Notes</h2>
 
<P>
The upgrade product supports upgrading from English to another native
language-for example, from an English language version of OS/2 to a French
language version of Windows NT Advanced Server. It also supports upgrading
to the same native language, such as Canadian French to Canadian French.
<P>
NOTE: Using Sytos Plus to back up data under one language version and
Windows NT Backup to restore the data under another language version is not
presently supported.
<P>
<P><h3>4.1 Code Page Support</h3>
 
To detect a change from one language version to another, the Windows NT
Upgrade Manager compares OS/2 code page information with the OEM code page
under Windows NT Advanced Server. Code pages determine the character
correspondence tables used to set up foreign language versions of software.
For purposes of the upgrade, code pages indicate how a utility should map
various extended characters that can appear in usernames, account
descriptions, and so on.
<P>
If code pages differ, the Upgrade Manager modifies the Upgrade Tool
Schedule so that the command lines of various upgrade utilities include a
/codepage option (for example, portuas /codepage:&lt;OS/2 code page number&gt;).
<P>
NOTE: The /codepage option is only necessary if changing languages is part
of the upgrade.
<P>
The exact steps used to detect code page changes follow.
<P>
1) The backenv utility determines LAN Manager code page information by:
<PRE>   a) Checking CONFIG.SYS.
   b) Calling the DosGetCtryInfo() API
   c) Using the default code page for the current country code (from
      CONFIG.SYS)

</PRE>2) If a code page is located, backenv writes the information to the
<PRE>   LMBAKENV.DAT and ADVISORY.TXT files. If no code page is found, nothing
   is written.

</PRE>3) Next, the Windows NT Advanced Server Upgrade Manager reads the code page
<PRE>   from LMBAKENV.DAT. If it differs from the existing Windows NT Advanced
   Server code page, the Upgrade Manager edits the Express Upgrade Tool
   Schedule by appending a "/codepage:&lt;code page number&gt;" option to the
   command line for the following utilities: restenv, portuas, userconv,
   aclconv, sfmconv, and aclcomp. If no code page exists, the OEM code page
   is assumed to be valid.

</PRE>Note that the Custom Upgrade Schedule always includes a /codepage:###
option for restenv, portuas, userconv, aclconv, sfmconv, and aclcomp.
Delete this option if you are not changing language versions. If you are
creating a Custom Upgrade schedule and also changing language versions:
<P>
1) Check the ADVISORY.TXT for OS/2 code page information.
<P>
2) Specify this information for each utility you run under Windows NT
<PRE>   Advanced Server. For example, if the code page is 863 ( for Canadian
   French language support), the command line for restenv should be
   "restenv /codepage:863", instead of "restenv /codepage:###".

</PRE>These procedures also apply if you run restenv, portuas, userconv, aclconv,
sfmconv, and aclcomp from the command line AND are changing language
versions.
<P>
4.2  If Windows NT Advanced Server Upgrade Manager
<PRE>     Fails to Restart After Converting Partitions
</PRE> 
After converting partitions to NTFS, the Windows NT Upgrade Manager
schedules a reboot and then places itself in the Startup Group. This
guarantees that the upgrade will continue automatically after the reboot.
<P>
For foreign language versions of Windows NT Advanced Server, the Upgrade
Manager uses the native translation for "Startup group". If the Upgrade
Manager cannot be placed in the default "Startup group" for a foreign
language version, then a group titled "Startup" is created containing an
icon for the Upgrade Manager. If a user double-clicks on this icon, the
Upgrade Manager will restart and continue with the upgrade.
<P>
<P><h3>4.3 AT Commands Containing "t" Variable</h3>
 
Running the backat utility creates a file called RESTAT.CMD that contains
AT commands. If this file contains commands that use the variable "t"
(e.g., at 12:00pm /every:t "dir"), the commands will not port correctly to
localized versions of Windows NT Advanced Server.
<P>
<P><h2>5.0  Troubleshooting</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>5.1 Sfmconv Error: Unable to Locate DLL</h3>
 
The following error message under Windows NT Advanced Server typically
indicates that Services for Macintosh has not been installed:
<P>
<PRE>   SFMCONV.EXE - Unable to Locate DLL. The dynamic link library SFMAPI.dll
   could not be found in the specified path.

</PRE>Install Services for Macintosh and rerun sfmconv.
<P>
<P><h3>5.2  Restenv Fails With Error 2</h3>
 
If various extended characters appear in LAN Manager directory names, uses,
or shares, the uses and shares may not upgrade successfully. Successful
porting depends on whether the Windows NT Advanced Server code page
supports an uppercase version of the extended characters in question.(See
item 4.0 for more information on code pages.)
<P>
If restenv encounters an unsupported extended character, it displays "Error
2" and skips the respective share or directory name.
<P>
5.3  Sfmconv Fails to Convert Macintosh Volumes
<PRE>     (Error 3)
</PRE> 
If a LAN Manager Macintosh volume uses a directory name with an unsupported
extended character, Sfmconv skips the volume during conversion and
generates an entry in SFMCONV.LOG similar to the following:
<P>
<PRE>   error: open error on G:\AIOSHARE\~AFP\VOLINFO.AFP,
   error=3 The system cannot find the path specified.

</PRE>where the directory name AIOSHARE contains unsupported characters.
<P>
If this error occurs, check unconverted volumes for directory names with
any of the unsupported characters listed in item 5.3. To convert the
volumes, remove these characters prior to running Sfmconv.
<P>
Note that, in this case, Sfmconv successfully converts non-offending
volumes.
<P>
<P><h3>5.4  Sfmconv Fails With Error 2, Can't Find File</h3>
 
Files or folders with names ending in a period or a space character cause
the error "Can't Find File" during sfmconv execution. These files are
converted, but the access permissions present on the file or folder may be
more than they should be. In addition, the Macintosh volume is not mounted.
To correct this problem, view permissions using File Manager, revoke those
that should not be present, and add the Macintosh volume.
<P>
<P><h3>5.5  Aclcomp Erroneously Reports Files Not Found</h3>
 
When upgrading partitions (particularly Macintosh volumes) with file names
containing certain extended characters, aclcomp may incorrectly report that
some files could not be found.
<P>
In addition, the following specific error is not important because the file
EA DATA.SF is normally deleted after conversion:
<P>
<PRE>   Error: the file E:\EA DATA. SF could not be found.

</PRE>5.6  Problems With User Account Replication in
<PRE>     a Mixed Domain
</PRE> 
If you experience user account replication problems in a Windows NT
Advanced Server domain that contains LAN Manager servers, consider the
following troubleshooting steps:
<P>
1) Does your security database contain usernames with extended characters
<PRE>   such as Š, ¢, and so on? Usernames containing these characters can cause
   problems with replication (see item 5.3). Try deleting or changing these
   usernames.

</PRE>2) Try rebooting  LAN Manager servers.
<P>
