The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft LAN Manager version 2.x
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Windows NT Server and Windows NT Advanced Server use the Servers group to
recognize LAN Manager servers participating in the Windows NT Server or
Windows NT Advanced Server domain. (In the remainder of this article,
Windows NT Server also refers to Windows NT Advanced Server.) When a LAN
Manager server is added to the domain as a backup domain controller (BDC),
its Machine account is added to the Servers group.
<P>
When PORTUAS or the Upgrade Manager is used to transfer the User Account
information from an existing LAN Manager primary domain controller (PDC) to
a new Windows NT PDC, the Servers group is transferred, as are the user
accounts that were created for each of the servers.
<P>
If the Servers group contains the wrong server accounts, problems will
result.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Below is a list of potential problems, their causes and solutions:

<UL><LI>Windows NT machine is listed in Server Manager as a LAN Manager server.
<P>
   Reason: The machine name of that server matches the machine name of a
   member of the Servers group in the domain.
<P>
   Solution: Remove that server account from the Servers group.

<LI>Windows NT Server attempts to synchronize account database with LAN
   Manager servers in a different domain, or, LAN Manager is not properly
   synchronizing the User Account database.
<P>
   Reason: The Netlogon service reads the Servers group to find the list of
   servers it should send user account database updates to. It sends to the
   specific server name. It doesn't validate which domain the machine is a
   member of. For additional information, please see the following article
   in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../winnt/q113409.htm">Q113409</A></B>
<PRE></PRE>      TITLE     : LAN Manager UAS Corrupted after Importing into NTAS
                  Domain

   Solution: Remove server account(s) from the Servers group, or add the
   server to the Servers group.

</PRE><LI>LAN Manager server cannot be promoted to BDC from standalone role if the
   PDC is a Windows NT Server.
<P>
   Reason: A user account for the Server Name already exists in the Windows
   NT Server domain and in the local user account information on
   the LAN Manager server. The passwords don't match.
<P>
   Solution: Use Server Manager to create a machine account for the LAN
   Manager server. Remove any user account for the Server name on the
   Windows NT Server domain and on the LAN Manager server while in
   standalone role.

<LI>LAN Manager server does not appear in Server Manager when View Domain
   Members Only is selected, or LAN Manager server that is NOT part of the
   domain is shown when View Domain Members Only is selected.
<P>
   Reason: Server Manager does not check with the LAN Manager servers when
   displaying information, but it checks the Servers group. If a LAN
   Manager server is on the network and communicating with the Windows NT
   Server, it will be listed in Server Manager. If the LAN Manager
   server isn't included in the Servers group, it will not appear to the
   Windows NT Server as part of its domain. On the other hand, if
   a server that is not part of the domain is included in the Servers
   group, it appears as a domain member in Server Manager.

<LI>Netlogon service fails in a LAN Manager domain, LAN Manager users are
   not able to log on.
<P>
   Reasons: A LAN Manager PDC is upgraded to a Windows NT Server
   and the original LAN Manager domain is left intact. PORTUAS creates
   computer accounts on the Windows NT Server for each of the LAN
   Manager servers in the original Servers group. Server accounts will then
   exist in both domains, the LAN Manager domain and the new Windows NT
   Server domain.
<P>
   Solution: Remove the servers group and/or server accounts from one of
   the machines; either the new Windows NT Server PDC or the LAN
   Manager PDC. Use Server Manager to remove the server account from the
   Windows NT Server domain.

<LI>Replication and trust relationships function incorrectly between Windows
   NT Server and LAN Manager domains.
<P>
   Reason: Duplicate server accounts exist in different domains, and are
   members of the Servers group on one or both of the domains.
<P>
   Solution: Remove the servers group and/or server accounts from one of
   the domains; either the new Windows NT Server PDC or the LAN
   Manager PDC. Use Server Manager to remove the server account from the
   Windows NT Server domain.
