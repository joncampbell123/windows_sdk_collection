<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When using Equinox Systems intelligent serial board and driver, the Win16
subsystem fails when a 16-bit terminal application is run. Example programs
of this type are WinCim and Procomm Plus for Windows.
<P>
The following message may appear:
<P>
<PRE>   Application caused an exception in the Win16 subsystem

</PRE>Then, the 16-bit application and the Win16 subsystem terminate. However,
Windows NT does not fail.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Win16 subsystem is not correctly dealing with overlapped reads when
communicating with the COM ports.
<P>
When a ReadFile is issued, the Win16 subsystem assumes it either has
completed immediately or that it has failed (that is, it assumes that the
read is synchronous). When using the Equinox serial driver, the Win16
subsystem assumes all the reads are failing because none of the reads are
completed immediately. This situation eventually causes the Win16 subsystem
to fail.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Workstation and
Windows NT Server version 3.5. This problem was corrected in the latest
U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT version 3.5. For information on obtaining
the Service Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base (without the spaces):
