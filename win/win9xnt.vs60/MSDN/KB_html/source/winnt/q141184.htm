The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
A DHCP server has active leases for Remote Access Service (RAS) servers,
but there are no RAS servers running on the network.
<P>
NOTE: You can tell that the addresses are for RAS by the telephone icon in
the active lease window.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When the RAS servers configured to use TCP/IP were previously active, they
received leased IP addresses from the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
(DHCP) server. When the RAS servers were configured to only allow users to
dial out those leased IP addresses were not deallocated by the DHCP server.
<P>
There were Remote Access servers installed (configured to Receive calls and
to dial-out) and configured for TCP/IP at one time, and they were allocated
addresses by the DHCP server, but they were changed to dial-out only
through the NCPA.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>

<OL><P><LI>Start Registry Editor and go to the following subkey:
<P>
<P><PRE>      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services
      \RemoteAccess\Parameters\IP
</PRE>
<P><LI>To delete the IP key, choose Delete from the Edit menu.
<P>
</OL>Be sure that the only key that appears under the Parameters key is the
NetbiosGateway key.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. We
are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
