The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
With the FirstWatch program, transition failures have been observed that
require the use of CLARiiON's Trespass utility. For example, the system may
start in Online Primary mode, but any attempt to change into Dual mode
fails. The Ha.log file contains errors that occurred while using Trespass.
You may also notice that the Scsi.exe, Clarscsi.exe, and Diskcfg.exe
programs do not display LUNs (logical unit numbers), which Trespass needs
to access.
<P>
The CLARiiON Agent Service may report problems in the event log. The
following two events messages have been logged:

<UL><LI>ERROR: Opening Device: , 1:0:0.

<LI>Is the device configured correctly?
<P>
</UL>After these events, attempting to select the host in ArrayGuide reports the
following error:
<P>
<PRE>   Could not connect to the chassis, check device name in fw31a's agent
   configuration file.

</PRE>ATF failures have also been observed.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem is caused by changes in the way Windows NT handles the SCSI
LUN enumeration in Service Pack 3.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Perform the following steps to resolve this problem:

<OL><P><LI>Obtain the following fix or wait for the next Windows NT service pack.
<P>
<P><PRE>      This fix should have the following timestamp:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>         07/02/97  09:41 PM               34,096 Scsiport.sys (Intel)
         07/02/97  08:41 PM               53,456 Scsiport.sys (Alpha)

      This hotfix has been posted to the following Internet location:

         <B><A href="ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/winnt/winnt-public/fixes/usa/nt40/">ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/winnt/winnt-public/fixes/usa/NT40/</A></B>
         hotfixes-postSP3/scsi-fix

   NOTE: Service Pack 3 must be applied to Windows NT 4.0 prior to applying
   this fix.

</PRE><P><LI>WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-
   wide problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct
   them. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the
   use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.
<P>
   Install the new Scsiport.sys and go to the following registry key:
<P>
<P><PRE>      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Disk\
</PRE>
<P><LI>Add the following new value to the above registry path to activate the
   new code:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Value Name = ScanDisconnectedDevices
      Data Type = REG_DWORD
      Data = 1
</PRE><P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0.
A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested
and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem.
Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix.
Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
