The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you have either a batch file or a command file that contains OS/2
commands and uses the Schedule service to run, OS/2 commands in the file
are not executed.
<P>
This applies to both the AT.EXE scheduler that comes with Windows NT and
the WINAT.EXE scheduler that comes with the Windows NT Resource Kit.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
By default, the schedule service runs under the System account. If you
change the schedule service to use a different logon account, OS/2 commands
become operational, but Win32 commands do not function properly. Note that
this behavior only applies to batch or command files being scheduled, and
does not apply to interactive usage.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
You can change the account that the schedule service uses by doing the
following:

<OL><P><LI>From the Control Panel window, choose the Services icon.

<P><LI>Select the Schedule service.

<P><LI>Choose the Startup button.

<P><LI>Change the Log On As account from System to the account of your choice.

<P><LI>Choose OK to keep your selection.
<P>
</OL>At this time, there is no workaround to run both types of commands in a
single, scheduled batch file or command file.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT and Windows NT
Advanced Server version 3.1. We are researching this problem and will post
new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
