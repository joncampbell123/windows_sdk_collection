The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When a BOOTP client gets an IP address, the "Reservation" changes to
"Reservation in use." However, the client name is removed from the list. As
a result there is no identifier in the list to differentiate which IP
address belong to which client.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The DHCP server does not handle the case correctly when the BOOTP client
sends a Null host name in the DHCP Request Packet.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Obtain the following fix or wait for the next Windows NT service pack.
<P>
This fix should have the following timestamp:
<P>
<PRE>   08/07/97  07:04 PM               116,496 Dhcpssvc.dll (Intel)
   08/07/97  06:03 PM               185,104 Dhcpssvc.dll (Alpha)

</PRE>NOTE: Service Pack 3 must be applied to Windows NT 4.0 prior to applying
this fix.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0.
A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested
and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem.
Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix.
Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Normally, when an administrator has set up a reservation for a BootP client
on a Windows NT Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server, the
Active Leases list includes the address, client name, and "Reservation."
When a DHCP client boots, the "Reservation" changes to "Reservation in
use."
<P>
If after applying the above-mentioned fix your DHCP Server continues to
experience the symptoms, then verify that you have configured Option 12 for
the BootP Client. When a BootP Client sends a request to the DHCP Server
and the host name is blank, the DHCP Server looks in the registry for the
HostName (Option 12) for use in propogating the Client Name field. If
Option 12 is left blank, it will leave the client name blank.
<P>
To correctly configure the BootP Client information, fill out the HostName
information in the Option 12 field of the entry. Once the Bootp request is
received, the Server will move the HostName option to the ClientName field.
