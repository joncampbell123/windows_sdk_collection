IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The Windows 95 Domain Name Service (DNS) resolver may have a problem when
receiving a DNS response packet that contains greater than 28 addresses.
For example, if you have 29 A records with the same host name, but
different IP addresses, and a Windows 95 client attempts to resolve that
name, the query will fail with the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Bad IP Address

</PRE><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
There is a new registry value for Windows NT 4.0 that allows you to limit
the number of A records returned for a DNS query to between five and
twenty eight.
<P>
To enable this change, obtain the following fix, or wait for the next
Windows NT service pack.
