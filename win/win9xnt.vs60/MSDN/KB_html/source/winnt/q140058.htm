<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Because the security log is limited in size, and because a large number of
routine audit records can make it difficult to find records that suggest a
security problem, you should carefully consider how you audit object
access. Generating too many audit records require you to review and clear
the security log more often that is practical.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
WARNING:  Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-
wide problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct
them.  Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the
use of Registry Editor can be solved.  Use this tool at your own risk.
<P>
If you have set the security log either to "Overwrite Events Older than n
Days" or "Do Not Overwrite Events (Clear Log Manually)", you may want to
prevent auditable activities while the log is full so no new audit records
can be written. To do this:

<OL><P><LI>Run Registry Editor (REGEDT32.EXE).

<P><LI>From the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM subtree, go to the following key:
<P>
<P><PRE>      \CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\
</PRE>
<P><LI>Add the entry:
<P>
<PRE>      Key:   CrashOnAuditFail
      Type:   REG_DWORD
      Value:  1

</PRE><P><LI>Save the changes. The Change will take effect the next time the computer
   is started. Update the Emergency Repair Disk to reflect these changes.
<P>
</OL>If Windows NT halts as a result of the security log becoming full, the
system must be restarted and reconfigured to restore it to high-level
security.  When Windows NT restarts, the Security log is full and so no
auditable actions are recorded until the Security log is cleared.
<P>
To recover when windows nt halts because it cannot generate an audit event
record:

<OL><P><LI>Restart the computer and log on using an account in the Administrators
   group.

<P><LI>Use Event Viewer to clear all events from the Security log, archiving
   the currently logged events. For details, see the "Event Viewer" chapter
   in the Windows NT Workstation or Windows NT Server System Guide.

<P><LI>Use the Registry Editor to delete and replace value entry
   CrashOnAuditFail, with data type REG_DWORD and value 1, under
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa (as described
   above).

<P><LI>Exit and restart the computer.
<P></OL>
