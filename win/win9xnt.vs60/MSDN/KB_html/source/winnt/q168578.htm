The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0
<LI>Routing and Remote Access Service Update
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After you issue several Update Routes commands from the Routing and Remote
Access Service server, the IPX network number of the WAN link gets changed
from all zeros to a number other than zero. This causes the Routing and
Remote Access Service server to drop all Routing Information Protocol
(RIP) &amp; Service Advertising Protocol (SAP) packets coming from the remote
router. You then lose all connectivity to the other router and the
networks it is connected to.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The router defaults to unnumbered WAN links with Routing and Remote Access
Service for Windows NT Server 4.0. If the Network number for the remote
router changes to anything other than all zeros the local router will drop
all RIP and SAP packets from the remote router.
<P>
For example:
<P>
<PRE>   From the local router, right-click Summary under IPX Routing. Then
   select Update Routes. After doing this several times, the Network
   number for the remote router may become something other than all zeros.
   The local router will then drop any RIP &amp; SAP packets received from the
   remote router. Update Routes will no longer work.

</PRE>To verify you are seeing this problem, do the following. Go to a command
prompt on each router and type:
<P>
<PRE>   C:\ipxroute config

</PRE>You should see something similar to this depending on how many network
cards are installed, etc.

   net 2: network number 00002602, frame type ethernet ii, device
   NdisWan10 (f4aa8a000000)+ active wan line

</PRE>If the NdisWan device's network number is something other than all zeros,
then you are experiencing this problem.

<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0.
A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression tested
and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem.
Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next service pack that contains this fix.
Contact Microsoft Product Support Services for more information.
