<PRE>  - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Windows NT Backup Domain Controllers do not list all trusted domains during
logon when there are more than twenty trust relationships.
<P>
Trusted domain users from domains that do not show up in the Backup Domain
Controller's list of domains during logon receive access denied errors when
attempting to use resources on the Backup Domain Controller.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This occurs because the full list of trusted domains is not replicated to
Backup Domain Controllers. Since the Backup Domain Controllers do not have
a complete list of trusted domains, they do not setup a secure channel with
Domain Controllers that exist in Domain accounts that did not replicate.
This results in access denied errors on clients from trusted domains
because there is no way for pass-through validation to occur.
<P>
The complete list of trusted domains does not replicate to Backup Domain
Controllers because Netlogon does not indicate all the trusted domain
accounts to replicate. Replication fails when Netlogon calls the LSA to get
the complete list of domain accounts to replicate during a synchronization.
Netlogon fails because it replicates domain names when it receives
STATUS_SUCCESS back from the LSA, however with a large number of trusted
domain names the LSA may return STATUS_MORE_ENTRIES instead of
STATUS_SUCCESS. The LSA returns STATUS_MORE_ENTRIES if the default buffer
supplied by Netlogon (1k in size) is too small to hold the complete list of
domain names. As a result, if there are too many domains to fit in the 1k
buffer, Netlogon ignores all but the last group of domain names returned by
the LSA when STATUS_SUCCESS is received.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
This problem has been corrected in the latest Service Pack for Windows NT
version 3.51.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51.
This problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51 U.S. Service Pack.
