<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes a new feature that is included in Windows NT 3.51
Service Pack 5. This feature is designed to allow you to reduce network
traffic related to Windows NT trust relationship polling over a wide area
network (WAN) using perhaps a leased line (for example, an ISDN or X.25
line) where the leased line provider charges by the amount of network
traffic. Trust relationship polling occurs between domain controllers (DCs)
to establish a secure channel.
<P>
In Windows NT 3.51 without this new feature, if the secure channel cannot
be established, it is retried every 15 minutes. With this new feature
installed you can control the intervals between which a DC sends discovery
packets in search of a DC of a trusted domain.
<P>
Microsoft has made a fix in Netlogon.dll so that you can increase the time
between retries and you can increase the time in which NETLOGON assumes a
DC is reachable (ScavengeInterval and ExpectedDialupDelay).
<P>
For additional information, , please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>

   TITLE     :How to Tune Trusts for Dialup Routers in a WAN

</PRE><h2>When Windows NT Uses Polling Between Domain Controllers</h2>
 
<P>
In Windows NT 3.51, once a secure channel to a trusted domain has been
established (that is, after the DC in domain_A found a DC in the trusted
domain_B), Windows NT does not continue to poll the secure channel to make
sure the secure channel is still available.
<P>
If, however, the DC is contacted for some other reason, for example, if a
user logs on and a pass-through authentication to the other domain is
required, the first DC needs to contact the second DC again and network
polling of the secure channel starts for this reason once again and stops
after the the pass-through authentication is completed.
<P>
Regular network traffic packets are not caused by trust relationship
polling of the secure channel, so if you frequently observe frames related
to trust relationship traffic on your WAN router, it is probably caused by
an unreliable WAN in which case this new feature helps you reduce this type
of network traffic.
<P>
<P><h2>NETLOGON Debug Output Samples</h2>
 
<P>
The following sections numbered 1, 2, 3, and 4 are about the NETLOGON debug
output
that appears when trusts are involved:

<OL><P><LI>The following NETLOGON debug-output is from a primary domain controller
</OL>(PDC) of
the trusting domain that cannot find a DC in the trusted domain (the
network cable
is disconnected):
<P>
00:00:00 NlInitTrustList: MASTERDOM in LSA
00:00:00 NlUpdateTrustListBySid: MASTERDOM: Added to local trust list
00:00:00 NlDcDiscoveryMachine: MASTERDOM: Start Discovery
00:00:05 NlDcDiscoveryMachine: MASTERDOM: Discovery retry 1
00:00:10 NlDcDiscoveryMachine: MASTERDOM: Discovery retry 2
00:15:00 NlDcDiscoveryMachine: MASTERDOM: Start Discovery
00:30:00 NlDcDiscoveryMachine: MASTERDOM: Start Discovery
<P>
The above frames show that the PDC tries to find the DC by calling
NlDcDiscoveryMachine three times and waits five seconds between each retry.
<P>
After these three retries the Scavenger Timer causes NETLOGON to look for
the trusted domain again every 15 minutes. Here are some of the frames that
appear (sent by the PDC of the trusting domain):
<P>
<PRE>   *BROADCAST    NBT NS: Query req. for MASTERDOM &lt;1C&gt;: check to find a
</PRE></OL>trusted domain DC
<P>
Because the PDC cannot find a DC by broadcasting the PDC starts using WINS:
<P>
<PRE>   *BROADCAST   ARP_RARP  ARP: Request, Target IP: 191.60.0.1:   find the
   router to get to WINS

</PRE><P><LI>The PDC of the trusting domain can find a DC in the trusted domain:

<P>

   00:00:00 NlUpdateTrustListBySid: domainname: Added to local trust list
   00:00:00 NlDcDiscoveryMachine: domainname: Start Discovery
   00:00:00 NlDcDiscoveryMachine: MASTERDOM: Found DC \\D-SPOCK on
      transport \Device\NetBT_Lance1
   00:00:00 NlDcDiscoveryMachine: MASTERDOM: DC \\D-KIRK ignored. DC
      previously found.
   00:00:00 NlDcDiscoveryMachine: MASTERDOM: DC \\NTD-UHURA ignored. DC
      previously found.
   00:00:00 NlDcDiscoveryMachine: MASTERDOM: DC \\D-MCKOY ignored. DC
      previously found.

</PRE></OL>Here are some of the frames that appear (sent by the PDC of the trusting
domain to the DC of the trusted domain):

   NETLOGON  SAM Response to SAM LOGON request  NTD-UHURA       RESCTL1
   NETLOGON  SAM Response to SAM LOGON request  D-MCKOY         RESCTL1

</PRE><P><LI>After the trust setup fails once because the cable is purposely
</OL>disconnected, the following NETLOGON debug-output occurs with the cable
reconnected. The PDC tries to log on to the trusted domain:
<P>
<PRE>   00:00  NlSessionSetup: MASTERDOM Try Session setup
   00:00 NlStartApiClientSession: MASTERDOM: Bind to server \\D-SPOCK.
   00:00 NlSetStatusClientSession: MASTERDOM: Set connection status to 0

   R_LOGON   RPC Server response logon:NetrServerReqChallenge(..)

</PRE><P><LI>After the trust is established, the connection to the trusted domain is
</OL>timed out (internally in NETLOGON):
<P>

   00:02:15 NlTimeoutApiClientSession: MASTERDOM: Unbind from server \\D-
      SPOCK.
   00:03:00 NlTimeoutApiClientSession Called

</PRE></OL>This causes only the following frames to appear on the network:
<P>
<PRE>   SMB       C close file, FID = 0x805 RESCTL1       D-SPOCK         IP
   SMB       R close file  D-SPOCK         RESCTL1       IP
   RESCTL1      D-SPOCK        TCP       .A...., len:    0, seq:   7004192,
   ack:
   422155081, win: 7883, src RESCTL1       D-SPOCK         IP

</PRE>The DC calls NlTimeoutApiClientSession every 45 seconds.
<P>
And finally the PDC drops the connection to the trusted DC by closing the
named pipe.
<P>
NOTE: The PDC does not drop the secure channel and therefore does not have
to rediscover the DC in the trusted domain. This saves the PDC scavenger
from having to look for the DC every 15 minutes.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server for Windows NT
version 3.51.
This problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
