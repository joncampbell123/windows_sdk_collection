<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Windows NT may report I/O errors on EISA machines when an ATI card is
present.
<P>
The ATI cards use many addresses across the I/O space, and infringe on
Extended Industry Standard Architecture (EISA) addresses. This will
cause address conflicts with EISA cards. This problem has been noted
with the Adaptec 174x series and the Ultrastor.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, move an EISA host adapter (for example,
from slot 1 to slot 3) so a different EISA address space (3C00 instead
of 1C00) will be used.
<P>
The ATI adapter uses EISA address space for its extended registers.
<P>
In MS-DOS, Windows, and OS/2, this problem can go unnoticed because
they don't check all I/O ranges. The miniport driver under Windows NT
reports the I/O that you will be using to access the hardware. Windows
NT keeps track of it. When the ATI card starts claiming the same I/O
ranges, the error gets reported under Event Viewer.
<P>
EISA specifications state that slot #1 uses addresses 1C00 - 1CFF,
slot #2 uses 2C00 - 2CFF, slot #3 uses 3C00-3CFF, and so on.
<P>
ISA uses address 00 - FF for I/O devices integrated onto the system
board and 100h - 3FFh for I/O expansion cards. 400 - FFFFh are
reserved.
<P>
There is nothing that can be fixed since EISA host adapters have to
use EISA address space (in fact, 1C80-1C83 are used to store card's ID
for slot 1, 2C80-2C83 for slot 2 ID).
<P>
The Adaptec and Ultrastor products included here are manufactured by
vendors independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or
otherwise, regarding these products' performance or reliability.
