<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes the Zero Administration Kit (ZAK) for Windows NT
Workstation 4.0.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Zero Administration Kit (ZAK) for Windows NT Workstation 4.0 is a
set of tools, methodologies, and guidelines designed to help corporate
administrators install and configure Windows NT Workstation-based
computers that are centrally administered. By using ZAK, a corporation can
reduce end-user operations costs. These costs include time wasted due to
self-induced system problems and unproductive activities. Examples of
behaviors that can result in wasted time include:

<UL><LI>Unintentionally deleting necessary system files from a hard disk.

<LI>Modifying Control Panel or registry settings incorrectly.

<LI>Introducing incompatible components or viruses by installing new
   software.

<LI>Changing system settings like colors, backgrounds, and desktop
   arrangement.

<LI>Installing and using unapproved software, such as games.
<P>
</UL>Using the ZAK, an administrator can prevent these types of actions and
increase the manageability of Windows NT Workstation systems by
centralizing functionality. ZAK tools and methodologies are intended for
use by experienced system administrators. An administrator can customize
ZAK to meet the specific computing needs of a corporation.
<P>
ZAK takes advantage of the security and reliability of the Windows NT File
System (NTFS) and the power and flexibility of system policies and user
profiles. These tools are already built into Windows NT 4.0.
<P>
The ZAK Setup program provides two options for configuring a workstation:
Taskstation mode and Appstation mode. Taskstation mode is designed for
users who run task-specific programs or browser-based programs. A typical
scenario for selecting Taskstation mode is a user who runs one or more
form-based programs. The default ZAK Taskstation mode configuration allows
users to run Microsoft Internet Explorer for Windows NT.
<P>
Appstation mode is designed for users who run a well-defined set of
programs. A typical scenario for selecting Appstation mode is a user with
access to a limited set of well-defined programs installed on a central
server. The default ZAK Appstation mode configuration allows users to run
Microsoft Office 97 programs and Microsoft Internet Explorer for Windows
NT.
<P>
Note that setting up an environment for corporate-wide deployment of
Microsoft Windows NT and Microsoft Office is a task that requires
careful thought and thorough planning. Although ZAK provides a method
for implementing Windows NT Workstation and Microsoft Office 97, it
should not take the place of the careful planning that must go into
deploying these products.
