SUMMARY
 
There are many advantages to using dynamic host configuration protocol
(DHCP) reservations for Windows NT clients (Server or Workstation) over
statically assigning the client with an IP address. The following describes
two:

<OL><P><LI>If your client is configured for Windows Internet Name Service (WINS)
   and your WINS database becomes corrupt at any time, a simple "ipconfig
   /release", "ipconfig /renew" from an MS-DOS prompt will force the client
   to re-register with the primary WINS server.

<P><LI>Using DHCP reservations allows administrators to have a central point of
   reference for all IP allocations in the organization. When you use DHCP
   Administrator (Mappings/Show Reservations), a complete list of active
   reservations as well as active leases is available in one location. This
   is a major advantage, especially when you are tracking down particular
   clients or even reassigning new scopes.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: It is important to understand that using DHCP reservations has no
basic functional difference from statically assigning a client an IP
address. A client will not function any differently with basic WINS
configurations (that is, expiration, release, re-registration, and so on),
but will only be capable of re-registering itself on the fly when
configured though DHCP (that is, ipconfig /renew). Hence, if you statically
assign a server an IP address and need to refresh its WINS registration,
you will need to execute a restart.
