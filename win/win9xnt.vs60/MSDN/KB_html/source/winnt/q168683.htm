<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you install Routing and Remote Access Service (RRAS) by clicking the
Have Disk option on the Services tab of the Network Control Panel tool, it
will result in the following error sequence:
<P>
<PRE>   Mprouter.exe - DLL Initialization Failed

   Initialization of the dynamic link library
   \%SystemRoot%\System32\Rasiphlp.dll failed. The process is terminating
   abnormally.

</PRE>After clearing this error, the following error is reported:
<P>
<PRE>   Service Control Manager
   At least one service or driver failed during system startup. Use Event
   Viewer to examine the event log for details.

</PRE>Examination of the Event Log shows the following Events:
<P>
<PRE>   Event ID: 20070
   Source: RemoteAccess
   Type: Error
   Category: none

   Point to Point Protocol engine was unable to load the
   \%SystemRoot%\System32\Rasipcp.dll module. A dynamic link library (DLL)
   initialization routine failed.

   Event ID: 20063
   Source: Router
   Type: Error
   Category: none

   Remote Access Connection Manager failed to start because the Point to
   Point Protocol failed to initialize. A dynamic link library (DLL)
   initialization routine failed.

   Event ID: 7024
   Source: Service Control Manager
   Type: Error
   Category: none

   The Remote Access Connection Manager service terminated with service
   specific error 1114.

   Event ID: 7001
   Source: Service Control Manager
   Type: Error
   Category: none

   The Routing and Remote Access Service depends on the Remote Access
   Connection Manager service that failed to start because of the following
   error: The service has returned a service specific error code.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When you install Routing and Remote Access Service by clicking the Have
Disk option on the Services tab of the Network Control Panel tool, the
files will be installed on the server. However, the original Oemnsvra.inf
file will be used for binding review and configuration rather than the
updated Oemnsvra.inf file included with Routing and Remote Access Service.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
The supported method for installing Routing and Remote Access is to run
Mprsetup.exe. This method copies the updated Oemnsvra.inf file into the
%SystemRoot%\System32 directory allowing Microsoft Windows NT Server to use
the proper Oemnsvra.inf file for binding review and configuration. The Have
Disk method is unsupported. This behavior is by design.
