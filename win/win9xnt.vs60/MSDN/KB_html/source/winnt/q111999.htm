<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After you add a second SCSI controller and install the Windows NT driver
for that controller, a STOP message appears when you restart the computer.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Windows NT uses the ARC path specified in your BOOT.INI file to find the
drive and partition containing the system files. If the path to the system
drive changes without the BOOT.INI being updated, the STOP message appears
when you restart the computer because Windows NT is unable to find its
system files.
<P>
In this situation, the path to the system drive has changed because it is
dependent on the order that the SCSI drivers load so if you install a
second SCSI driver that loads before the one currently on the system and if
the Windows NT system files are on a SCSI hard drive connected to the
original controller, the STOP message appears when you restart the
computer.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
The immediate solution to avoid receiving this STOP message is to restart
your computer to the Last Known Good configuration. After doing this, a
permanent solution is to install the new SCSI driver, edit the BOOT.INI and
change the ARC path BEFORE restarting the computer so it will be correct
when you restart.
<P>
There are usually two lines in the BOOT.INI that need to be changed,
although there may be more if you have more than one installation of
Windows NT. The first line that needs to be changed is in the [boot loader]
section and looks something like the following:
<P>
<PRE>   default=scsi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\windows

</PRE>and the second line that needs to be changed is in the [operating systems]
section and looks something like:
<P>
<PRE>   scsi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\windows="Windows NT Version 3.1"
   /SCSIORDINAL:0

</PRE>The one thing that all the lines that need to be changed have in common is
scsi(0). This indicates which SCSI adapter is connected to the system
drive. If you have already tried to install a second adapter and received
this error, you need to change all references to scsi(0) to read scsi(1).
After doing this, you can restart your computer. For more information on
the contents of the BOOT.INI file and ARC paths, see page 160 of the
Windows NT Advanced Server "Concepts and Planning Guide" or query on the
following words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   boot and arc

</PRE>After you make these changes and restart your computer, use Disk
Administrator to save the new drive configuration to the Emergency Repair
Disk.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT and Windows NT
Advanced Server version 3.1. We are researching this problem and will post
new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
