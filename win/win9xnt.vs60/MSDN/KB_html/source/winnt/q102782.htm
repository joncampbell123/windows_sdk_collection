   TITLE     : How to Capture Modem Commands in Windows NT 4.0

</PRE>WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them.
Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of
Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.
<P>
If you experience problems connecting to Remote Access Services (RAS),
try to identify the specific problem by doing the following:

<OL><P><LI>If you are receiving error messages, choose Help and follow the
   suggested steps.

<P><LI>Check to see if you can access your modem from the Terminal
   program. If the modem works with Terminal, do the following:
<P>
   a. Make sure your modem is on the list of modems supported by
<P><PRE>      Windows NT Remote Access. (See the Windows NT Hardware
      Compatibility List.)
</PRE><P>
   b. Make sure you have the correct cabling required by Remote
<P><PRE>      Access. For more information on RAS cabling requirements, check
      Remote Access Help. (Search on: Cabling Requirements.)
</PRE>
<P><LI>Enable device logging on Remote Access by doing the following:
<P>
   a. Start Registry Editor.
<P>
   b. Go to the following subkey:
<P>
<PRE>         hkey_local_machine\system\currentcontrolset
         \services\rasman\parameters

   c. If the value does not exist, choose Add Value from the Edit menu.

   d. For the following fields, enter these values:

         Value Name: logging
         Data Type: REG_DWORD
         String: 1

   e. Stop and start Remote Access Service and Phone Book to enable
      the DEVICE.LOG file.

   The RAS DEVICE.LOG file will be created in the SYSTEM32\RAS
   subdirectory. See the next section for information on using
   DEVICE.LOG.

</PRE></OL><h3>Using DEVICE.LOG</h3>
 
<P>
The DEVICE.LOG file contains the strings that are sent to and received
from the serial device (either a modem or an X.25 PAD). DEVICE.LOG is
useful for troubleshooting problems with serial devices, and for
testing new entries added to the MODEM.INF or PAD.INF files.
<P>
NOTE: You may want to view the DEVICE.LOG file in a text editor that
can display both character and hexadecimal output as some of the
information will not be printable characters. Also, DEVICE.LOG
contains a carriage return (h0D) and line feed (h0A) byte at the end
of each line. These bytes are provided by the program that creates the
DEVICE.LOG file and do not represent information communicated from or
to the device.
<P>
The DEVICE.LOG file contains:

<UL><LI>The command string sent to the device.
<LI>The echo of the command.
<LI>The response from the device.
<LI>The connect and carrier bps (bits per second) (modems only).
<P>
</UL>For each bps pair, there may be several sets of command, echo, and
response data. If the command and echo (on a modem) do not match, a
hardware error message will be generated.
<P>
The Connect string from the modem (the last response string from the
modem when a connection is established) will normally contain the
connect bps, the carrier bps, or both. If the Connect string contains
both, the connect bps and the carrier bps lines will give the values
from the Connect string. If the Connect string does not have one of
the bps values, a best estimate of the actual bps value is given. Both
of these values are used by RAS; for this reason, RAS initializes the
modem to include both values in its response.
<P>
NOTE: "Connect bps" refers to the DTE (data terminal equipment) speed
of the modem. This information is required by RAS. The "carrier bps"
refers to the DCE (data communication equipment) or modem-to-modem
speed. This value is not used internally by RAS, but is displayed if
available.
<P>
If your modem cannot return both the DTE and DCE speeds, configure it
to at least return the DTE speed. Without knowledge of the DTE speed,
RAS cannot reset the port appropriately, thus resulting in
transmission errors.
