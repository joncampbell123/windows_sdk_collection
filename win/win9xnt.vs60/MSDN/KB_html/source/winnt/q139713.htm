The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51
</UL>

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Shared access to a file on a NetWare server can fail with a sharing
violation, even with the Shareable attribute set on the file at the NetWare
server, when you use 16-bit applications that open the file for exclusive
use.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Some older 16-bit MS-DOS-based applications that are not network aware tend
to open files for exclusive use when in fact shared access to the file is
desired. NetWare servers can work around this by setting a Shareable
attribute on the file, which means that the server itself manages locking
issues for the file and makes it shareable between multiple NetWare
clients, even if a client application explicitly opens the file for
exclusive use.
<P>
However, if a client specifies that the file should be opened with Deny
Read and Deny Write access, then even with this Shareable attribute set,
the NetWare server gives exclusive access to the file to that client.
Sharing violations occur if other clients attempt to access the file.
<P>
In certain situations the 16-bit layer of the Client Services for NetWare
(CSNW) redirector opens files with deny read and deny write access when the
application really requires the file to be opened with exclusive access.
This results in sharing violations, although the same operation succeeds
using MS-DOS-based NetWare clients.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. A
fix to this problem for 3.51 is in development, but has not been regression
tested and may be destabilizing in production environments. Microsoft does
not recommend implementing this fix at this time. Contact Microsoft Product
Support Services for more information on the availability of this fix.
This problem was corrected in Windows NT Workstation or Server version 4.0.
