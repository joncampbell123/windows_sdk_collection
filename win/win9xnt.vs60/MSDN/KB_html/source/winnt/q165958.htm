<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
You are unable to load your Madge network adapter on a computer running
Windows NT 4.0.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Because of an error in the Microsoft Windows NT registry regarding the name
of the driver for the Madge SMART 16/4 PCMCIA RINGNODE, you are unable to
load the Madge driver .
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
In order to get the Madge SMART 16/4 PCMCIA RINGNODE to install and load
during setup, you will have to make the following changes:
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor
can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Not that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

<OL><P><LI>Expand the file system._ from the &lt;platform&gt; directory on the
   distribution CD to "c:\temp\system.".

<P><LI>Copy the &lt;platform&gt; directory a server share point.

<P><LI>Run REGEDT32.EXE, to edit the registry.

<P><LI>From the Window menu chose HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE

<P><LI>From the Registry menu select "Load Hive" and enter the path
   "c:\temp\system.".

<P><LI>Enter the name "Madge", when the system prompts for a Key Name

<P><LI>Find the following section:
<P>
<P><PRE>      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Madge\System\ControlSet01\Services
      \Pcmcia\Database\MADGE\SMART 16/4 PCMCIA RINGNODE
</PRE>
<P><LI>In this section, change the name of the file pointed to by the "Driver"
   from "madgemport" to "mdgmport".

<P><LI>Select the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Madge key again, and from the Registry
   menu select "Unload Hive"

<P><LI>Select "OK" to the dialog that gets displayed.

<P><LI>Exit the Registry editor.

<P><LI>Delete the "system._" from the Server Distribution point created in
<P><PRE>    step 2 above and place the "system." from the c:\test directory into
    the Server Distribution point.  This file will now contain all the
    needed registry settings to allow the Madge driver to load during
    setup.
</PRE><P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Please be aware that many of the current line of laptops and portables
typically place the sound card on IRQ 10, which is the default IRQ for
PCMCIA cards. Because of this conflict, you may still experience problems.
Please contact Madge Technical support for more details.
