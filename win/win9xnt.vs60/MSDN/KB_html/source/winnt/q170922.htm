<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article attempts to:

<UL><LI>Explain, on a high level, how PCI devices are detected.
<LI>Explain why some PCI devices are not detected or hang the computer.
<LI>Explain how the computer determines which PCI devices are assigned which
   interrupt requests (IRQ).
<P>
   NOTE: Windows NT expects all devices to be configured correctly before
   it attempts to start so that it can load the appropriate driver for each
   device. Windows NT does not utilize the Plug and Play specification;
   therefore, it cannot dynamically reassign an IRQ.

</UL><h3>PCI Overview and Interrupt Assignment</h3>
 
<P>
The PCI specification allows the motherboard manufacturer to determine
interrupt assignments. Because there is no single method to assign an IRQ
to a PCI device, you may experience problems installing multiple PCI
devices in Windows NT.
<P>
Programmable Interrupt Controller (PIC):
<P>
Every motherboard has a device called the Programmable Interrupt Controller
(PIC). This is the central location all devices must use when they wish to
be serviced by the central processing unit (CPU). The following is an
example of one design:
<P>
<PRE>   PCI Int#A (PCI Slot 1)---      |===============|
                            |     |Programmable   |
   PCI Int#A (PCI Slot 2)---------|               | Interrupt Line to CPU
                            |     |Interrupt      |========&gt;
   PCI Int#A (PCI Slot 3)---      |               |
                                  |Controller     |
                                  |===============|

</PRE>A problem with this design is that three PCI devices must share the same
interrupt number and line. If any of the cards do not properly pass the
interrupt (driver or hardware failure) to one of the other devices
requesting attention, one of the cards may fail to be detected or will not
be used by a driver.
<P>
The following is an example of a newer design:
<P>
<PRE>   PCI Int#A (PCI Slot 1)----------|==============|
                                   |Programmable  |
   PCI Int#A (PCI Slot 2)----------|              | Interrupt Line to CPU
                                   |Interrupt     |========&gt;
   PCI Int#A (PCI Slot 3)----------|              |
                                   |Controller    |
                                   |==============|

</PRE>Because each device has their own direct trace to the PIC, this design
allows the PIC to assign a different IRQ for each PCI device. This allows
assigning virtual IRQ's or allowing each device to have its own discreet
IRQ.
<P>
<P><h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
 
<P>
If the computer fails to boot, there is probably a hardware issue. Please
contact the hardware manufacturer for more information.
<P>
Perform one of the following steps if the computer boots, but Windows NT
states a device failed:

<UL><LI>Click the Start button, point to Programs, point to Administrative
   Tools, click Windows NT Diagnostics, click the Resources tab, and then
   click IRQ.
<P>
   If all PCI devices in question appear with their own separate IRQ's, but
   your system shows them as sharing an IRQ, the problem is most likely
   system related. Please check with your hardware manufacturer to see if a
   BIOS upgrade is available.

<LI>Install the last PCI device that fails, but do not install its driver.
   If the computer fails, it is most likely a hardware issue that should be
   resolved with the manufacturer.

<LI>If possible, remove all PCI devices and install them in the reverse
   order to see if IRQ sharing performs better. You can also try changing
   the slots where the cards are installed.
