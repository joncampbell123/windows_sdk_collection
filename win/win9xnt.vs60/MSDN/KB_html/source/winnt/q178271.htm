The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0
</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
You cannot rename a file that is located on version 6.1 or earlier of a
UNIX-based DEC Pathworks server to a name that has more characters than the
current file name.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is only seen under the following conditions:

<UL><LI>The files are located on a UNIX-based DEC Pathworks server, version 6.1
   or earlier.

<LI>The client exhibiting the behavior is a computer running Windows NT 4.0
   Server or Workstation, any service pack level.

<LI>The client is using Windows NT Explorer to rename the file.

<LI>The client has a drive letter mapped to the Pathworks server.
<P>
</UL>Under the above conditions, the file rename will not allow you to extend
the name of the file. If attempted at an MS-DOS prompt, or through Windows
NT Explorer by means of a UNC connection, you can rename the file normally
as expected.
<P>
The reason for this behavior is that the Pathworks server reports its
maximum allowed file name length incorrectly.
