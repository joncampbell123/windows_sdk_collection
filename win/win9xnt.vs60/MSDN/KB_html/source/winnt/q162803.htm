<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The embedded ESS688 sound chip on NEC Versa 4050 notebook computer running
Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 will not function properly when you use a PCMCIA
(PC Card) modem. As soon as the modem is removed and the system restarted,
the sound chip functions properly.
<P>
NOTE: The NEC versa 4050C is not currently supported for use with
Microsoft Windows NT 4.0. Please refer to the Windows NT 4.0 Hardware
Compatibilty List (HCL) included with your documentation for supported
hardware.
<P>
An updated Hardware Compatibilty List is available at the Microsoft Web
site: <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com">http://www.microsoft.com.</A></B>
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
If all other causes are eliminated, for example, IRQ or I/O conflicts, ESS
driver not installed properly, sound not enabled in the system BIOS (see
Other Troubleshooting Steps later in this article) there are three other
settings in the NEC Versa system BIOS that you need to configure properly.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Turn on the NEC Versa, go into the system BIOS routine and make sure
the following options have these settings:

<UL><LI>Infrared Port: set to REAR
<LI>Serial Ports: set to ENABLED
<LI>Infrared/Serial Ports: set to RECONFIGUREABLE
<P>
</UL>Save these settings and exit the BIOS utility. Turn off the notebook,
insert the PC Card modem, turn on the notebook, and start Microsoft
Windows NT 4.0. If the modem and sound devices are configured properly
(see Other Troubleshooting Steps to verify or change settings), the
sound chip and the modem should now function properly.
<P>
<P><h3>Other Troubleshooting Steps:</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>In the system BIOS, make sure that the sound chip is enabled.

<P><LI>In Windows NT, make sure that the ESS688 driver is installed.

<P><LI>If the driver is not installed, run the Multimedia tool in Control
  Panel. Click the Drivers tab, click Audio Devices, click Add, then select
  Unlisted or Updated Driver. Click OK, enter the path to the driver, click
  OK, and select ES688/ES1688/ES1788 AudioDrive 2.00.04 from the driver
  list. Click OK, supply non-conflicting I/O Address, IRQ, and a DMA Level
  (most often the defaults are acceptable - see step #7 for verifying
  available settings). For example, the system on which this
  article is based has audio settings of IRQ=7, IO=220, and DMA=1. The
  COM3 Port settings are IRQ=4 and IO=3E8.

<P><LI>In the Devices tool in Control Panel, verify that the AUDDRV is set for
   Automatic and is started after the driver is installed and the system
   has been restarted.

<P><LI>Verify that Audrive.sys is located in the %Systemroot%\System32\Drivers
   folder and has a file size of 62 KB, and is dated 5/13/96 or later.

<P><LI>In the Modems tool in Control Panel, verify the Modem settings. Look at
   the Attached To field and identify which COM port the modem is using.
   The following table indicates the default IRQ and I/O values used by
   specific COM port settings.
<P>
   When possible use standard settings for COM ports:
<P>
<PRE>      SERIAL 1   COM1:  I/O Address = 3F8h   IRQ = 4
      SERIAL 2   COM2:  I/O Address = 2F8h   IRQ = 3
      SERIAL 3   COM3:  I/O Address = 3E8h,  IRQ = 4
      SERIAL 4   COM4:  I/O Address = 2E8h,  IRQ = 3

   Regardless of whether the modem is using the default settings (this can
   be confirmed in the Advanced Ports tools in Control indicated by the
   table, make sure the sound driver settings do not conflict. If they do,
   adjust the sound driver to use different settings.

   If the modem is using the default settings specified in the preceding
   Table, you need to ensure that the modem and sound driver settings do
   not conflict. To check the modem default settings, use the Advanced
   Ports tool in Control Panel.

</PRE><P><LI>Verify which IRQs and I/O addresses are currently in use (with the
   modem installed) by running Microsoft Windows NT Diagnostics in the
   Administrative Tools group and clicking the Resources tab;
   check both IRQ and I/O ports.

<P><LI>If the sound driver resource settings conflict with devices
   other than a configured COM port (for example, Network adapter),
   identify available IRQ and I/O resources and modify either the sound
   driver or other adapter to use those available resources, eliminating
   any conflicts.

<P><LI>Make sure that the PC Card slots are enabled. Try the modem in the
   other slot.

<P><LI>Try a different, supported PC Card modem.

<P><LI>If this is a non-HCL system (not on the Microsoft Windows NT 4.0
   Hardware Compatibility List), try a supported notebook or contact
   your hardware vendor.
