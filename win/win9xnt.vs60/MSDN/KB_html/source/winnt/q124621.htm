<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When the Schedule Service runs a job that was previously submitted by
running the AT utility, the environment space provided to the scheduled job
includes only the System Environment Variables.
<P>
The scheduled job’s environment space does not include any User Environment
Variables.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To see which environment variables are available to scheduled jobs on your
machine, first run the following command specifying a &lt;time&gt; that is in the
near future:
<P>
<PRE>   AT &lt;time&gt; /INTERACTIVE CMD

</PRE>This will cause a new command window to open as a scheduled job at the
specified time. Type "SET" (without the quotes) in this command window to
obtain a list of Environment Variables available to scheduled jobs.
<P>
User and System Environment Variables can be defined by running the System
applet from within Control Panel.
<P>
To make environment variables available to scheduled jobs, make sure that
they are defined as System Environment Variables.
<P>
After modifying System Environment Variables it is necessary to shutdown
and restart your computer to make them available to applications.
