<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In the &lt;systemroot&gt;\System32\Spool\Drivers\W32x86 directory, there are
several printer driver files dated June 3, 1980 (6/3/80). These printer
drivers are stored for compatibility with Windows NT 3.1 clients and
applications.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In Windows NT 3.1, all printer drivers are stored in the
&lt;systemroot&gt;\System32\Spool\Drivers\W32x86 directory. Because version 3.5
drivers are not compatible with version 3.1 drivers, printer drivers are
stored in a version directory in versions 3.5 and later. When a new printer
driver is installed, the driver version is checked and copied into the
appropriate version directory as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   Windows NT 3.1 drivers:

      &lt;systemroot&gt;\System32\Spool\Drivers\w32x86\0

   Windows NT 3.5 and 3.51 drivers:

      &lt;systemroot&gt;\System32\Spool\Drivers\W32x86\1

</PRE>Because Windows NT supports both old and new printer drivers, both versions
can be set up on the same print server; both Windows NT 3.1, and 3.5 or
3.51 clients will be able to access the correct version of the printer
driver files.
<P>
The date on these files is set to 6/3/80. Setting the date back to 6/3/80
ensures that the file name and date will not conflict with any other
versions of the driver that may be installed, and also allows multiple
versions of a printer driver to be installed.
<P>
During Setup, Windows NT checks the version of the printer driver and
copies the printer driver to the 0 or 1 directory. Then the printer driver
is also copied into the W32x86 directory to ensure compatibility with
Windows NT 3.1, because some Windows NT 3.1 driver installation programs or
applications may still look there for the printer driver. Finally, the date
for the driver in the W32x86 directory is set to 6/3/80, a date which is
earlier than the first release of Windows NT. This ensures that the driver
name and date will not be identical to those of any other driver in the
version directories.
