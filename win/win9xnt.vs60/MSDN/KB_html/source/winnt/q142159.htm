The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5 and 3.51

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you run Unattended or Computer Profile Setup (CPS), the SNMP protocol
is not installed to target computers (by default). However, you can
accomplish automated installation of SNMP by modifying setup files.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
WARNING: Modification of INF files may cause serious, system-wide problems
before and after Setup and may require you to reinstall Windows NT to
correct them. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from
the modification of INF files can be solved. Make INF modifications at your
own risk. Corporate Network Systems does not support the modification of
INF files. For more information on INF files, refer to the Programmer's
Guide included in the Windows NT DDK or contact Microsoft Consulting
Services or a Solution Provider.
<P>
<P><h3>Computer Profile Setup</h3>
 
<P>
On the distribution server, make these necessary modifications:

<OL><P><LI>In the Defaults.inf file, change the third parameter of
   !TCPIpServiceMask in the [TCPIPServices] section to 1.
<P>
   [TCPIPServices]
   !TcpIpServiceMask = {"1","1","1","0","0","0","0","0"}

<P><LI>(Optional) Modify the script fragment in Oemnxpsn.inf so that the SNMP
   configuration dialog box is not displayed. With this modification, Setup
   will not allow you to configure SNMP, so it will be installed with
   default values.
<P>
   Code fragment before modification:
<P>
<P><PRE>      LibraryProcedure Result, $(!TCPCFG_HANDLE), CPlSnmp, $(!STF_HWND)
      ifint $(Result) == 0
<PRE></PRE>         set CommonStatus = STATUS_REBOOT
      else-ifint $(Result) == 1
         set CommonStatus = STATUS_REBOOT
      else
         set RegistryErrorIndex = $(Result)
         goto fatalregistry
      endif

   Code fragment after modification:

      ifstr(i) $(!STF_GUI_UNATTENDED) == "YES"
         Set Result = 0
      else
         LibraryProcedure Result, $(!TCPCFG_HANDLE), CPlSnmp, $(!STF_HWND)
      endif

      ifint $(Result) == 0
         set CommonStatus = STATUS_REBOOT
      else-ifint $(Result) == 1
         set CommonStatus = STATUS_REBOOT
      else
         set RegistryErrorIndex = $(Result)
         goto fatalregistry
      endif

</PRE></OL><h3>Uattended Setup</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Copy the \I386 directory from the Windows NT compact disc to your hard
   drive.

<P><LI>Expand i386\OEMNXPTC.IN_ to OEMNXPTC.INF. The Expand.exe file is located
   in the %SystemRoot%\SYSTEM32 directory.

<P><LI>Rename i386\OEMNXPTC.IN_ to OEMNXPTC.BK_.
<P>
</OL>WARNING: Modification of Setup files can cause serious, system-wide
problems before and after Setup and may require you to reinstall Windows NT
tocorrect them. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from
the modification of Setup files can be solved. Make Setup file
modifications at your own risk.

<OL><P><LI>Modify i386\OEMNXPTC.INF:
<P>
   ; Original line below
<PRE>   ;                 set InstallList = {"1","1","0","0","0","0","0","0"}
   ; Modified line below
                     set InstallList = {"1","1","1","0","0","0","0","0"}

   NOTE: It is not necessary to rename Oemnxptc.inf to Oemnxptc.in_.
   Windows NT Setup does not require the file to be compressed or named
   with an .in_ extension.

</PRE><P><LI>Expand i386\Oemnxpsn.in_ to Oemnxpsn.inf. The Expand.exe file is located
   in the %SystemRoot%\System32 directory.

<P><LI>Rename i386\OEMNXPSN.IN_ to OEMNXPSN.BK_.
<P>
</OL>WARNING: Modification of Setup files can cause serious, system-wide
problems before and after Setup and may require you to reinstall Windows NT
to correct them. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting
from the modification of Setup files can be solved. Make Setup file
modifications at your own risk.

<OL><P><LI>Modify i386\Oemnxpsn.inf using Step 2 in the Computer Profile Setup
   section.
