<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
To fully automate the process of logging on to a SLIP server using a
Windows NT Remote Access Service (RAS) client, you must use Rasdial.exe to
dial the SLIP server.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Windows NT RAS PhoneBook application (Rasphone.exe) does not include a
facility to fully automate logging on to a SLIP server. You can use the
Switch.inf file to automate all parts of the logon process except the
receipt of the IP address. In the Terminal window, RAS prompts you to
manually supply the IP address; there is a field for it in the lower right
corner.
<P>
To fully automate the connection to the SLIP server, you can use the
Rasdial command-line utility as follows:

<OL><P><LI>Use the RAS PhoneBook application to create an entry for your SLIP
   server. Note the entry name you assign to this new entry.

<P><LI>Click Network and make sure SLIP is selected.

<P><LI>Click Security. In the After Dialing field, select the name of the
   Switch.inf script you created to automate the process of logging on to
   your SLIP server.
<P>
   For additional information on automating a RAS logon using the
   Switch.inf file, refer to the following Microsoft Knowledge Base
   article:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../crossnet/q125975.htm">Q125975</A></B>
<PRE></PRE>      TITLE     : Automating Remote RAS Logons Using SWITCH.INF Scripts

</PRE><P><LI>Connect to the SLIP server using the RAS PhoneBook entry you have just
   created. You must enter the IP address in the Terminal window; however,
   you will not need to do this again. RAS records the address you enter in
   the Rasphone.pbk file, under the SlipIpAddress parameter.

<P><LI>For future connections to the SLIP server, run the following command:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Rasdial &lt;entry name&gt;
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;entry name&gt; is the entry name you assigned in step 1.
<P>
   Rasdial does not prompt you to enter the IP address in the Terminal
   window. Rasdial uses the IP address included in the section of
   Rasphone.pbk for your SLIP entry.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: This procedure only works if you are assigned the same IP address
by the SLIP server each time you dial in. If the SLIP server does not
assign you the same IP address each time, you must use the RAS
PhoneBook application, which enables you to enter whatever IP address the
SLIP server assigns you.
