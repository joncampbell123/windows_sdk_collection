The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
System performance drops to an unacceptable level while a large file is
being copied.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may be a symptom of a problem with the way that the Server
service interacts with the system cache in certain configurations.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
You may be able to work around this problem by tuning the server to
prevent the providing of large amount of memory to the system cache.
<P>
To do this, perform the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Start Control Panel Network.

<P><LI>From the Installed Network Software box, select Server, and then click
   Configure.

<P><LI>If the option "Maximize Throughput for File Sharing" is currently
   selected, you may get better performance during large file copy
   operations by selecting the "Maximize Throughput for Network
   Applications" or "Balance" options.

<P><LI>If you elected to make a change in Step 3, restart your computer so the
   change can take effect.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The "Maximize Throughput for File Sharing" option permits the system cache
to use more available memory than it would otherwise. In this situation,
the available memory can drop to levels that result in heavy swapping
activity on the hard disks in order to accommodate requests from user or
system applications that may subsequently need to be swapped into memory.
<P>
The cache manager periodically gives up memory that it has allocated so
that the system will never run completely out of memory due to caching
alone. This can happen whenever a file copy operation is complete or when
a threshold value is reached. This means that the problem described above
does not occur if a series of smaller files are copied. The threshold
value, when "Maximize Throughput for File Sharing" option is not selected,
is enough higher than the threshold value when the problem does not occur
there either.
<P>
This problem is also more noticeable on computers with lower total
physical memory. When more total physical memory is available, the minimum
available memory threshold is also higher, which can alleviate the
problem.
<P>
The article referenced below explains the registry
setting LargeSystemCache, the setting which is changed when
changes are made to the Maximize Throughput server service settings.

         Title     : Excessive and Unnecessary Paging Activity

</PRE></OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT and Windows NT
Advanced Server version 3.1. We are researching this problem and will post
new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
