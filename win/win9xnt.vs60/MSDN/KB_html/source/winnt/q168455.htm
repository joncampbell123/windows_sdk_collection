<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
A client connected to an Ethernet switch may not receive a renewed DHCP IP
address during startup. Releasing and renewing the IP address manually
works.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Some Ethernet switches have a feature that checks ports for a loop
condition when ports become active (this is the learning mode for spanning
tree algorithm). If a loop is found, traffic is not allowed across the
port. This process of checking for a loop condition takes approximately 10-
15 seconds during which the Windows NT Workstation computer appears to be
on the network, yet no traffic is being passed. The DHCPREQUEST packet
(along with any other traffic during that time) is lost.
<P>
If you have a hub at the end of the port, the hub will have already brought
the port up. You will only fail when connected directly to the switch.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this problem, disable the spanning tree algorithm feature of
your Ethernet switch. For information on how to do this, please contact the
switch manufacturer.
