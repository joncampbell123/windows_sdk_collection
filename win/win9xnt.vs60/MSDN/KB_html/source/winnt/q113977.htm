<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If the partition containing the Windows NT Server system files is mirrored
and then lost, you can use a fault tolerant boot floppy disk to restart
Windows NT Server and access the mirror of the lost drive. This article
explains how.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
A fault tolerant boot floppy contains the files necessary to boot Windows
NT from a mirrored partition. For instructions on creating a fault-
tolerant boot floppy for x86-based systems and RISC-based systems, see the
Concepts and Planning Guide for your version of Windows NT Server.
<P>
Once Windows NT is successfully booted from the fault tolerant boot
floppy, the files and directories on the mirror drive are available for
normal disk operations. Even if the disk containing the primary partition
is lost, no differences are apparent to you (unless you study the status
information displayed in Disk Administrator). But fault tolerance no
longer exists: if the remaining partition is lost, all its data is lost
also. So it is safer to break the current mirror set, configure a new boot
and system partition, and create a new mirror.
<P>
<P><h3>Alternate Method of Creating a Fault Tolerant Boot Floppy</h3>
 
<P>
If the primary partition of a mirror set is lost, you cannot start Windows
NT Advanced Server, and no other Windows NT system is available from which
to create a fault tolerant boot floppy, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Boot to MS-DOS, either at another system or with a floppy on the
   current system.

<P><LI>Copy the Windows NT Advanced Server Setup Disk 1 for floppy disk
   installation to a blank floppy disk with the DISKCOPY utility (or
   another utility that will copy a mirror image of the original disk,
   including the boot sector).

<P><LI>Delete all files on the copied disk except NTDETECT.COM and NTLDR._.

<P><LI>Expand the NTLDR file to the SETUPLDR.BIN file using the command:
<P>
<P><PRE>      EXPAND NTLDR SETUPLDR.BIN
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: To properly expand files from the Windows NT 3.51 or 4.0 CD-ROM,
   you must use the Expand.exe utility included with that version of
   Windows NT. The Expand.exe utilities included with Windows NT 3.51 and
   4.0 can only be run from a command prompt in a 32-bit environment such
   as Microsoft Windows 95 or Windows NT.

<P><LI>If the mirrored drive is a  SCSI disk requiring a SCSI driver to work
   with Windows NT, copy and expand the appropriate SCSI driver from the
   Windows NT Advanced Server Setup Disk 1, then rename it to
   NTBOOTDD.SYS.

<P><LI>Using a text editor such as EDIT.COM, create a BOOT.INI file with an
   ARC path that points to the Windows NT directory on the mirror
   partition.
<P>
</OL>The disk is now ready for use as a fault tolerant boot floppy.
