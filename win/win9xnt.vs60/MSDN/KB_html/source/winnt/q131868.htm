<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how to troubleshoot a PC Card (PCMCIA) modem in
Windows NT. The following topics are discussed:

<UL><LI>Windows NT does not recognize the modem
<LI>Terminal or HyperTerminal stops responding (hangs)
<LI>Remote Access Service (RAS) does not function properly
<LI>The modem makes no sound when dialing
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Windows NT Does Not Recognize the Modem</h3>
 
<P>
To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Verify that the PC Card modem you are trying to install is on the
   Windows NT Hardware Compatibility List (HCL). If the PC Card modem is
   not on the HCL, Microsoft has not tested it and it is not supported by
   Microsoft.

<P><LI>Verify that the PC Card modem is fully inserted into the PC card socket
   before you turn on your computer. If necessary, turn off your computer,
   insert the PC Card modem into the PC Card socket, and then turn on your
   computer.

<P><LI>Verify that the PC Card modem is functioning properly by using a
   manufacturer-provided diagnostics program or the Pcmcmd.exe support
   program. The Pcmcmd.exe support program displays the hardware
   information from the PC Card modem. If the Pcmcmd.exe support program
   is unable to display any hardware information for the PC Card modem,
   the PC Card modem may be defective.
<P>
   NOTE: The Pcmcmd.exe support program is located on the Windows NT CD-
   ROM in the \Support\Debug\&lt;hardware platform&gt; folder.

<P><LI>In Control Panel, double-click Ports to see if an additional COM port
   is listed. If an additional COM port is listed, the PC Card modem is
   enabled. Verify that the IRQ settings and the I/O addresses are
   correct. Use Event Viewer to view the System log and check for I/O or
   IRQ conflicts.
<P>
   NOTE: If possible, use the following standard settings for your COM
   ports:
<P>
<PRE>      SERIAL 1   COM1:  I/O Address = 3F8h   IRQ = 4
      SERIAL 2   COM2:  I/O Address = 2F8h   IRQ = 3
      SERIAL 3   COM3:  I/O Address = 3E8h,  IRQ = 4
      SERIAL 4   COM4:  I/O Address = 2E8h,  IRQ = 3

   Many manufacturers include a configuration program that configures the
   PC Card's IRQ, slot location, and sound settings. This program can
   be used to modify the PC Card's settings so that conflicts do not
   occur.

</PRE><P><LI>In Control Panel, double-click Devices to determine if the PCMCIA
   driver startup is configured as Boot. The PCMCIA driver activates all
   PC Card devices , and if this driver does not start, no PC Card can
   work. If the driver is set to start automatically but does not start
   automatically, use Event Viewer to view the System log and check for
   errors.

<P><LI>Because there are many different PC Card chipsets available, some
   PC Cards do not work properly with some computers. To determine if this
   is the case, test your PC Card in a different computer, or test a
   different PC Card in your current computer.
<P>
</OL><h3>Terminal or HyperTerminal Stops Responding (Hangs)</h3>
 
<P>
To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Verify that Windows NT recognizes your modem by following the steps in
   the "Windows NT Does Not Recognize the Modem" section of this article.

<P><LI>If first in, first out (FIFO) is not supported by your PC Card modem,
   you must disable FIFO. To do so, follow these steps:
<P>
   a. In Control Panel, double-click Ports, click Settings, click the port
<P><PRE>      that your PC Card modem is configured for, and then click Settings.
</PRE><P>
   b. Click Advanced, click the FIFO Enabled check box to clear it, click
<P><PRE>      OK, and then restart your computer when you are prompted to do so.
</PRE><P>
</OL><h3>Remote Access Service (RAS) Does Not Function Properly</h3>
 
<P>
To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Verify that the Terminal or HyperTerminal program functions properly.
   If your PC Card modem works with these programs, verify that the modem
   type is being detected correctly, and that the speed setting is
   correctly configured.

<P><LI>If you experience dropped connections or noisy phone lines, lower your
   modem's connection speed and then test to see if the issue is resolved.

<P><LI>Verify that your phone cable is functioning properly by using a
   different cable, and then test to see if the issue is resolved.

<P><LI>Change the Logging value in the following registry key to 1:
<P>
<P><PRE>      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\RasMan
      \Parameters
</PRE><P>
   Restart your computer, try to connect again, and then view the
   Device.log file in the %SYSTEMROOT%\SYSTEM32\RAS folder for information
   about commands that the modem is sending and errors that are reported.
<P>
</OL><h3>The Modem Makes No Sound When Dialing</h3>
 
<P>
To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Consult the manufacturer's documentation or contact the manufacturer to
   verify that your modem normally makes a dialing sound. Some modems emit
   a series of clicks when waiting for a dial tone, dialing, or waiting
   for an answer.

<P><LI>To verify that your modem's speaker is not disabled, consult the modem
   manufacturer's documentation. On some modems, the speaker is disabled
   by default.
<P>
   NOTE: The AT command "AT M1" (without the quotation marks) usually
   enables the modem speaker.
