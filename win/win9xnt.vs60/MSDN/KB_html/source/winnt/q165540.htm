The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When users try to disconnect a drive that is mapped to their home
directory by typing "net use /d" at a command prompt, they may receive
the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   The device is being accessed by an active process.
   More help is available by typing NET HELPMSG 2404.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The above error message will occur if the drive that is mapped to the
user's home directory is set through the "Home Directory, Connect To"
option within User Manager.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When the "Connect To" option for Home Directory within User Manager is
defined to connect a drive letter to a specified UNC path, you
create this connection using NDDEAGNT (NetDDE Agent), which is part of
NetDDE. Because NetDDE is involved, there is an active connection to the
server and that connection cannot be readily broken.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Use Windows NT Explorer or Windows NT File Manager (Winfile.exe) to
override the lock on the drive mapping so it can be disconnected.
<P>
If the connection between the workstation and associated server is broken,
the connection will timeout after a short period and the drive mapping can
be disconnected by typing the "net use /d" at a command prompt.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5,
3.51, and 4.0. We are researching this problem and will post additional
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
