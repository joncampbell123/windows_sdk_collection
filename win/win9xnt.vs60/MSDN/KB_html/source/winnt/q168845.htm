<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When adding a Windows NT version 3.51 or 4.00 client into a Systems
Management Server version 1.2 Site a Windows NT event 3031 will be created
in the System Event log of the client. The description of event 3031 is as
follows:
<P>
<PRE>   The redirector was unable to delete the file specified on server
   SMSLOGONSERVER when it was closed by the application. The data contains
   the name of the file.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Systems Management Server Windows NT client setup program Cli_nt.exe,
during the creation of a Client Configuration Request (CCR), will create a
client access token file in the Ccr.box directory on the client's logon
server. The access token file named using the clients SMSID (Smsid.tok) is
created using a flag FILE_FLAG_DELETE_ON_CLOSE. When the handle to this
file is closed the file is deleted. Although the file has been deleted the
Windows NT redirector attempts to remove this file which returns event
3031.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. We
are researching this problem and will post additional information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0.
A supported fix is now available for Windows NT version 4.0, but has not
been fully regression-tested and should be applied only to systems
experiencing this specific problem. Unless you are severely impacted by
this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next
Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft Technical Support
for more information.
