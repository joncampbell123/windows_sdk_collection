<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Compaq Smartdesk 2855 cnt75MB21 has a built-in Netflex-2 network card
based on the Intel 595 chipset. This network card is not inherently
supported by Windows NT and requires a device driver from Compaq.
<P>
Currently, there is no driver support available for Windows NT version 4.0.
<P>
The Compaq driver is contained in a Softpaq file called Sp1251.exe and can
be found on Compaq’s Web site.
<P>
The Network adapter must be pre-configured using the flashset or softset2
diagnostic disk that shipped with your laptop or docking station.
<P>
The network adapter can only be configured for IRQ-11, unless a newer
version diagnostic utility disk is used, contact Compaq Support for more
detail.
<P>
The Compaq Smartdesk 2855 cnt75MB21 also contains a built-in SCSI
controller, make sure the SCSI controller is configured to use a different
IRQ other than IRQ-11 prior to loading the NIC device driver.
<P>
The SCSI controller is based on the Adaptec 151x/152x/AIC 6260/6360 and can
use the supported device driver Sparrow.sys that ships with Windows NT by
using Windows NT Setup\options\add remove SCSI adapter.
<P>
For more information regarding this controller, please see the following
Microsoft Knowledge Base article:

   TITLE     : Required Settings for Adaptec 1510 SCSI Host Adapter

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following are excerpts from the Readme.txt contained on the Compaq
Softpaq Sp1251.exe for network card support.

<OL><P><LI>The NIC adapter should be configured prior to setting it up in NT.

<P><LI>In NT, select the Control Panel choose the Network icon select
   "Add Adapter".

<P><LI>A list of available adapters will be displayed. Choose "Other
   &lt;Requires&gt; disk from manufacturer".

<P><LI>Insert the Compaq Integrated NetFlex-2 ENET Drivers disk and press
   enter.

<P><LI>A dialog box will come up with "A:\-".  Change the path "A:\NT\35"
   which is the path  where the driver EPRONT.SYS and setup file
   OEMSETUP.INF are located.

<P><LI>The screen will come up with four settings: Interrupt; I/O Port;
   I/O Channel Ready; and Transceiver Type.  Make sure the values that
   come up match the actual board settings  as configured with FlashSet
   or SoftSet2.  DO NOT change the I/O Channel Ready.  The proper setting
   was already determined.  Changing this parameter could cause the
   adapter to become inoperable.  Click on OK to accept the adapter
   settings. Click on OK to exit the network configuration screen.

<P><LI>NT will then perform the binding process.  If any additional
   network software options were installed, you may be prompted for
   specific information for these packages.

<P><LI>Restart NT when prompted, in order for the changes to take affect.
