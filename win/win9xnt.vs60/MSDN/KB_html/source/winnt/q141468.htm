<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you setup your system up for recovery in the event a Stop error
occurs a second pagefile may be created. If your pagefile is not located
on the %SYSTEMROOT% partition you will receive the following message:
<P>
<PRE>   In order to create a debugging information file, the initial
   pagefile size on volume &lt;drive letter&gt; must be at least
   &lt;amount of disk space&gt; megabytes. The initial pagefile size
   will be changed now.

</PRE>The amount of disk space requested will be approximately equal to the
amount of physical memory you have on the system plus 1MB.
<P>
If there is not enough disk space available on the %SYSTEMROOT% partition
you will receive the following message:
<P>
<PRE>   There is not enough free space on the boot drive to enable
   crash recovery. At least &lt;amount of disk space&gt; megabytes
   of free space on drive &lt;drive letter&gt; are needed. Please
   free up some disk space and try again.

 MORE INFORMATION
 ================

</PRE>When the pagefile is not initially located on the %SYSTEMROOT% partition,
a pagefile is created on the %SYSTEMROOT% to reserve adequate disk space
for the dump file if a Stop error occurs. This is done to ensure the
creation of the dump file.
<P>
This also eliminates the problem of the MEMORY.DMP file not being created
if the paging file is not located on the %SYSTEMROOT% directory as noted
in the following knowledge base article:

   TITLE     : Windows NT Does Not Save Memory Dump File After A Crash

</PRE>Although you can change the path for the location of the dump file using
Control Panel, Windows NT always writes the debugging information to the
%SYSTEMROOT% partition first, and then moves the dump file to the path
specified.
