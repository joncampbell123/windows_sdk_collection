The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5 and 3.51
<LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If a Windows 95 user has a profile on a Windows NT server, an associated
file called User.dat is created on the server. Occasionally, it is
necessary for an administrator to delete this file. However, the
administrator cannot delete this file, even if the administrator owns the
file, the file is closed, and the administrator has complete access to it
at both the NTFS and the share levels. Only the user who used the profile
and who therefore wrote the User.dat file to the Windows NT server can
delete it.
<P>
Here is a possible scenario:

<UL><LI>Windows 95 is set up with User Profiles (for roving features).

<LI>John, a domain user, logs on and writes User.dat on the computer running
   Windows NT Server.

<LI>John logs out and shuts down the computer running Windows 95.

<LI>Sheryl, the Windows NT Server administrator, tries to delete User.dat
   using File Manager.

<LI>Access is denied. Sheryl can take ownership of the file, has full NTFS
   access, full share access, and the file is not open.

<LI>John is given sufficient rights to delete the file. John can now log on
   to the computer running Windows NT Server and delete User.dat.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Currently, the only resolution is for the user who uses the profile to
delete User.dat.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. We
are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
