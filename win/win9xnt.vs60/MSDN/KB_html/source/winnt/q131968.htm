<P><h3>How RAS Supports X.25 Networks</h3>
 
<P>
RAS does not know what medium it is running over. It does not know about
the X.25 protocol, just as it does not know about how phone lines and modem
equipment work. The RAS server uses the Eicon Technology WAN Services Eicon
drivers and an internal Eicon X.25 adapter to convert the X.25 protocol to
the serial (RS232) protocol signals (and vice versa), or it can send and
receive serial signals to and from an external X.25 PAD (packet
assembler/disassembler), in which case, no Eicon software and hardware is
necessary because the X.25 PAD does the protocol conversion.
<P>
Some RAS client versions can also be configured with the Eicon driver and
adapter or the external PAD, but usually the clients use a modem to call
the X.25 network provider's dial-up PAD, which is also a modem. After the
RAS client's modem and the X.25 provider's dial-up PAD connect, the X.25
provider usually requires callers to identify themselves for billing
purposes. To support caller identification, most RAS clients can run a
customized command script, and some can also go into an interactive post-
connect Terminal mode, to allow the client to send the user name and
password.
<P>
NOTE: The external PAD configuration mentioned above is not supported in
Windows for Workgroups 3.11 and Windows NT Workstation and Server versions
3.1, 3.5, and 3.51. However, there are no known reasons why it should not
work.
<P>
<P><h3>Overview of X.25 Networks</h3>
 
<P>
An X.25 network transmits data with a packet-switching protocol. This
protocol relies on an elaborate worldwide network of packet-forwarding
nodes (DCEs) that can deliver an X.25 packet to its designated address.
X.25 also requires additional hardware such as an X.25 Smart card or a PAD.
<P>
For additional information, see the Windows NT 3.5 Server "Remote Access
Service" manual, chapter 6.
<P>
<P><h3>Reasons to Use an X.25 network for RAS</h3>
 
<P>
In addition to transmitting data more reliably than regular phone lines,
X.25 connections supply bandwidths of up to 56 kilobytes (K) (64K in
Europe).
<P>
However, in areas where ISDN is available, Microsoft recommends using ISDN
rather than X.25, because ISDN is much faster without compromising
reliability.
<P>
For additional information on ISDN and RAS, see the Windows NT 3.5 Server
"Remote Access Service" manual, page 8, or the Windows NT 3.5 RAS online
Help.
