The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Your system may fail and the following STOP message in Rdr.sys appears:
<P>
**** STOP 0x0000000A
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
If the browser service is shut down during an election, a failure may
occur. A scheduled process performed a net use * /d command while logged on
as the local system account. This disconnected the IPC$ null session.
This removes RPC communication that the browser service relies on for
communication with other servers. The same effect can be observed while
shutting down the browser. In order for the failure to occur, an election
must take place at this point and the server must be a multiprocessor
system.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Configure the system so that the batch processes run by the scheduling
services will not be performed under the context of the system account.
The net use /d command specifying * or \\server\ipc$ are the commands that
must not be carried out. By preventing the carrying out of such commands,
the browser will not experience these problems.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0.
A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression
tested and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific
problem. Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem,
Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains
this fix. Contact Microsoft Product Support Services for more information.
