<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Windows NT, Windows 95, and Windows for Workgroups (WFWG) workgroup clients
are not able to browse remote workgroups across routers using the TCP/IP
protocol. Workgroup clients can, however, browse remote domains under
certain configurations described in this article. However, domain clients
can browse remote workgroups in subnets with domain clients present.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In this article, a domain client is a Windows for Workgroups, Windows
95 or Windows NT workstation; or a Windows NT stand-alone server computer
that is a member of a domain. For a WFWG and Windows 95 WINS client, if the
workgroup name is the same as one of the domain names in the network, the
workgroup name automatically becomes a member of that domain. A workgroup
client is a member of a workgroup.
<P>
In a big network with multiple domains and workgroups spread across several
subnets separated by routers, browsing can become complex and hence it
becomes necessary to understand the techniques of browsing to troubleshoot
browser-related problems. When all workstations and servers are WINS
enabled, if there are no workgroups in the entire network, all clients
will be able to browse every other domain and members of those domains in
the network.
<P>
When there are workgroups in the network, workgroup clients will not
be able to see remote workgroups and members in those workgroups. This is
because workgroups are not WAN aware and workgroups separated by routers
are considered to be discrete workgroups even if they have the same name.
This is by design and is an expected behavior. Workgroup clients can
however browse remote domains provided there is at least one member of the
remote domain on the local subnet. This domain member announces the
presence of that domain on its subnet and thus workgroup clients know about
the existence of that domain and will get the browse list from that domain
member that is also a master browser for that domain on that subnet.
<P>
Domain members, however, can browse a remote workgroup, provided there is
at
least one domain member on the remote subnet where the workgroup is
located. This domain member includes in its browse list the workgroup
name it sees on its network and sends that list to the domain master
browser, which is the primary domain controller (PDC) of that domain. The
domain master browser in turn sends that list to every other master
browser in remote subnets. Thus, all other subnets having members of that
domain will know this workgroup exists. Because workgroups do not
have a concept of domain master browser, this technique will not work for
workgroup members and so they cannot browse remote workgroups.
