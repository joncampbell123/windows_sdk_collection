The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0
- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0
 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
An event ID 2000 may appear in the System Event log of a computer running
Windows NT server when a remote network command fails. The following error
message may appear as well:
<P>
<PRE>   STATUS_NO_SUCH_FILE

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
An event 2000 may appear when a network application sends a Delete File
command to the shared network drive of a computer running Windows NT
Server if the file it is trying to delete does not exist on that server. A
"STATUS_NO_SUCH_FILE" event ID 2000 with the following data will appear in
the System Event Log:
<P>
<PRE>   0000: 00040000 00540001 00000000 c00007d0
   0010: 00000000 c000000f 00000000 00000000
   0020: 00000000 00000000 05180bc5

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you review an event 2000, pay particular attention to the second word
in the second line of the event data (in this case, c000000f). The event
that corresponds to c000000f is the one connected with the
STATUS_NO_SUCH_FILE message.
<P>
<P>
If your computer is running Windows NT Server 4.0, you can determine the
cause of the event by installing the Network Monitor Tools and Agent. You
can do this in Control Panel, by double-clicking Network, clicking
Services, and then clicking Add.
<P>
For instructions on setting up Network Monitor, see the following Microsoft
Knowledge Base article:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE ID: <B><A href="../urjump.htm">Q155586</A></B>
   TITLE     : How to Make a Network Trace with Network Monitor

</PRE>If you need to monitor the network from an alternate platform, contact
Microsoft Technical Support; or obtain Network Monitor from the Systems
Management Server installation, if it is available.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
The System.evt file can be monitored in the same time window to determine
the time interval that may contain an event 2000 in the trace. Filtering
event 2000s in Network Monitor makes reviewing the capture easier to read.
<P>
To filter in Network Monitor, use the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Open a capture file; use any name ending in .cap.

<P><LI>Click the Capture menu, and then click Display Captured Data, and then
   press F8 to show the Display Filter window.

<P><LI>In the Display Filter window, double click the second line under AND
   where it reads ANY&lt;-&gt;ANY.

<P><LI>Click the Property tab.

<P><LI>Click +SMB in the Protocol:Property window.

<P><LI>Click Command, and then select Delete File from the Value column on
   the right.

<P><LI>Click OK twice.
<P>
</OL>Network Monitor displays frames containing filtered data. Traces similar to
the ones below will be displayed:
<P>
<PRE>   4207 SMB C delete file, File = \APPS\EIS\APL\PCDM\PCDMNNI\PCDMNNI.TAF
      134.131.3.62 134.131.51.1 IP

   4217 SMB R delete file - DOS Error, (2) FILE_NOT_FOUND 134.131.51.1
      134.131.3.62 IP

   5031 SMB C delete file, File = \APPS\EIS\APL\PCDM\PCDMNNI\PCDMNNI.ILM
      134.131.3.62 134.131.51.1 IP

   5040 SMB R delete file 134.131.51.1 134.131.3.62 IP

</PRE></OL>Frame 4207 shows that a computer with the address 134.131.3.62 is sending
the Delete File command to delete the file Pcdmnni.taf. Frame 4217 shows
that the computer running Windows NT Server with the address 134.131.51.1
responds with the message FILE_NOT_FOUND; this frame will correspond with
the event 2000 listed in System.evt. Frame 5031 shows that the file has
been renamed to Pcdmnni.ilm and that the command Delete File is sent again.
<P><h2>Finally, frame 5040 shows that the file has been deleted successfully.</h2>
