The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server, version 3.51
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
Customers that have installed the Services for Macintosh and have not
yet upgraded their partitions to NTFS will not have the Microsoft User
Authentication Module (UAM) volume. This article explains how to set
up that volume after a NTFS partition has been created.
<P>
The Microsoft UAM volume is formed with the following files:

<UL><LI>MS UAM
<LI>ReadMe.UAM
<P>
</UL>To create this volume and put the correct files in it, do the
following:

<OL><P><LI>Make sure that you have an NTFS partition.

<P><LI>If you are running Windows NT 3.x, run the following command from a
   command prompt:
<P>
<P><PRE>      SETUP /i  OEMNXPSM.INF  /c  UAMINSTALL
</PRE><P>
   If you are running Windows NT 4.0, run the following command from a
   command prompt:
<P>
<P><PRE>      SETUP /i  OEMNSVSM.INF /c  UAMINSTALL
</PRE><P>
   The OEMNXPSM.INF and OEMNSVSM.INF files are the script information files
   for the Services for Macintosh, and UAMINSTALL is the name of the
   section that has the necessary commands to modify the registry in order
   to add that volume.

<P><LI>The Windows NT Setup screen appears and returns to the command
   prompt if the above step was successful.
<P>
   There are two things happening at this point. One is the creation of
   the volume itself, and the other is the copying and creation of the
   files. The SMFUAM.IFO and the SMFUAM.RSC are the two forks for the MS
   UAM file, and the SFMUAM.TXT is the ReadMe.UAM file. These files get
   stored within a subdirectory called AppleShare Folder, which is also
   created by this script file.

<P><LI>Because the script file modifies the registry, you will not see the
   volume if you have the File Services for Macintosh started. If this is
   the case, stop and start the File Services for Macintosh.

<P><LI>Check the newly created volume in File Manager, Server Manager or
   the MacFile icon in the Control Panel.
<P></OL>
