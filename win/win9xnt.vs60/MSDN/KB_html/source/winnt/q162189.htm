The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51 and 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
On a Windows NT MacFile server with multiple Macintosh volumes, Macintosh
clients may experience wait times showing network busy (-&gt;&lt;-) for varied
lengths of time while Afp calls requiring an exclusive lock retry. This
issue can be verified in a network trace where Macintosh clients are seen
to be issuing retry calls AfpGetFileDirParms and AfpCloseFork until an
exclusive volume lock on the MacFile server is released.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Where multiple volumes exist, as file status changes were being processed
across various Macintosh volumes, an exclusive and volume-specific lock
was being applied during volume change notify processing. In a particular
instance, a volume-specific lock was not being released. This lock was
released as more volume changes were processed; however, wait times
varied.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
The issue was addressed in a code change that manages the change notify
processing more efficiently and resolves the held lock condition.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.51
and 4.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Windows NT 4.0
U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on
the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

<P>
In addition, performing the following actions can have a positive impact
on Macintosh performance:

<OL><P><LI>Disabling the Catsearch Function - this requires the hotfix for Windows
   NT version 3.51 or Service Pack 3 or later for Windows NT version 4.0
   and a registry change.

<P><LI>Disabling EnableOplocks on the NT Server (registry change only).

<P><LI>Reducing AppleTalk Traffic by using a 3rd party application called Less
   Talk on the Mac client.

<P><LI>If Microsoft Mail is being used -- reset the PC Polling interval on the
   MS Mail client to reduce the frequency of polling for new mail.

<P><LI>Apply a hotfix that resolved a record locking issue -- "Record Unlock
   After PC Release" (this fix should be included in the hotfix under item
   number one.
