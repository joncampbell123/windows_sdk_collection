<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you attempt to install the Compaq Business Audio utilities in
Windows NT, the setup program will state that the sound hardware
cannot be found. This occurs even though the Business Audio sound
driver is listed as being installed in Control Panel under Drivers and
is operating correctly.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The utilities that ship with the Windows 3.x-based Compaq Business
Audio system require a Windows 3.x Virtual Device Driver (VxD) to
communicate with the Business Audio card. Because VxD's are not
compatible with Windows NT, the setup program for the utilities is not
able to confirm that the Business Audio card is installed and
therefore the utilities are not installed.
<P>
Installation of the Business Audio driver that ships with Windows NT
3.1 will allow use of the card, but the Windows 3.1-based utilities
that ship with the card will not run under Windows NT.
<P>
The Compaq Business Audio utilities are manufactured by Compaq, a vendor
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise,
regarding these products' performance or reliability.
