<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
BOOTP relay agents are not able to successfully service all DHCP client
computers from a LAN segment using multiple logical IP subnets. Only one of
the logical IP subnets is able to obtain DHCP IP addresses for its DHCP
client computers.
<P>
For additional information on DHCP with multiple logical IP subnets when
you are not using relay agents, please see the following article(s) in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../winnt/q124026.htm">Q124026</A></B>
   TITLE     : Requests Fail on Logically Multihomed Server (Single NIC)

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
A router implemented as a BOOTP relay agent must insert its IP address in
the gateway IP address (giaddr) field of the DHCP Discover packet. A DHCP
server uses the giaddr field to determine the subnet that sent the request
for IP addresses and which IP addresses to offer. If the giaddr field is
blank, the DHCP server assumes that the request is from the local subnet.
<P>
The following is an excerpt from RFC 1542:
<P>
<PRE>   If the relay agent does decide to relay the request, it MUST
   examine the "giaddr" ("gateway" IP address) field. If this field is
   zero, the relay agent MUST fill this field with the IP address of
   the interface on which the request was received. If the interface
   has more than one IP address logically associated with it, the
   relay agent SHOULD choose one IP address associated with that
   interface and use it consistently for all BOOTP messages it relays.

</PRE>Because only one address is used in the giaddr field by the relay agent,
only one of the logical subnets is serviced through DHCP.
