The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Windows NT does not allow you to make multiple connections to a shared
network server from the same workstation if you attempt to use more than
one set of credentials. If you attempt to make two or more connections to
the same server using two or more sets of credentials, you will receive
the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   System error 1219 has occurred.
   The credentials supplied conflict with an existing set of credentials.

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
A set of credentials consists of a user name and a password. Both File
Manager and NET USE allow you to specify a parameter that designates which
user account you want to use when you connect to a server. If you make a
connection to a server using one account, then make another connection to
the same server using a different account (with the first connection still
intact), you receive the above error message. To make the connection with
the other account, disconnect the previous connection(s) to the server.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>On your computer running Windows NT in the same domain as the server
   that you want to connect to, use File Manager connect to a share on the
   server. Do not type anything in the Connect As field.

<P><LI>Establish a second, separate connection to the same server, either to
   the same share or a different share on that server. This time, specify
   an account in the Connect As field. This account must be different than
   the one with which you are currently logged on.

<P><LI>Choose OK.
<P>
   The above error message appears.
