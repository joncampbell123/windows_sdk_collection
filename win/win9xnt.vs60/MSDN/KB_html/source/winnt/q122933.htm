 10      Lobe wire fault detected by OcTk1601. Please check cable
         connections.

   Action: Check all cables and connections and try another lobe media
      cable. Retry the operation.

 11      OcTk1601 has failed the lobe wrap test resulting from the beacon
         auto-removal process and has deinserted from the ring.

   Action: The adapter has deinserted from the ring, because the ring was
      beaconing. Check the network speed settings and cable connections and
