The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0
</UL>

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Hewlett-Packard (HP) scanners may not be detected properly by the Deskscan
program when you are using a BusLogic BT-542b SCSI host adapter.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs when you are connecting a HP scanner to a BusLogic
SCSI host adapter with a BIOS firmware revision of 3.35/4.70. The HP
scanner is properly detected with earlier versions of the BIOS.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Contact either BusLogic for a possible BIOS upgrade or Hewlett-Packard
for an updated version of Deskscan.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
After you start Deskscan, your computer may slow for 3-4 minutes before
Deskscan finally appears and misreports the scanner as absent. If you
attempt to test for the presence of the scanner, the computer slows again
for 3-4 minutes. If you opt to view the SCSI address settings within
Deskscan, a scanner is reported at all eight IDs, even when it and the
adapter are the only devices on the bus. Regedt32 reports the situation
properly.
<P>
This behavior has been reported with the HP ScanJet IIp and IIc using the
BusLogic BT-646s h/a (MCA card) adapter and also on a PowerPC using the
BT-542B and BT-545S SCSI controllers.
<P>
NOTE: The scanners on the Windows NT 4.0 Hardware Compatibility List were
not tested on BusLogic controllers. These scanners are only supported if
connected to one of the following SCSI controllers: AHA-1542CP, AHA-2742,
and AHA-2940, NCR 8100S, and 8250S.
