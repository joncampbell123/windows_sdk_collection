<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes a procedure that ensures proper replication of login
scripts from a Windows NT server to a LAN Manager server.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>On The LAN Manager Server</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Check for the following entries in the LANMAN.INI file and create
   them if they do not exist:
<P>
   In the [replicator] section:
<P>
   replicate = import
<P>
<PRE>   importpath = &lt;ImportPath&gt;   (For example, REPL\ACCTS. This must be
                               relative to the LANMAN directory and is
                               needed only if your import directory is
                               something other than repl\import)

   importlist = &lt;WindowsNTServerName&gt;   (For example, SALES-PDC)

   logon = &lt;LanManagerAccount&gt;   (Must be the same as the account used on
                                 the Windows NT export server)

   password = &lt;LanManagerPassword&gt;   (must be the same as the account used
                                     on the Windows NT export server)

   tryuser = &lt;yes or no&gt;   (default = yes, set to "no" if you do not want
                           the LAN Manager server to attempt to update
                           directories while a user is logged on locally)

   In the [netlogon] section:

   scripts = &lt;ScriptsPath&gt;   (For example, REPL\IMPORT\SCRIPTS)

</PRE><P><LI>Create the import path directory tree if it does not exist
   (ie. C:\LANMAN\REPL\IMPORT\SCRIPTS).

<P><LI>Start the Replicator Service on the LAN Manager server with the command,
   NET START REPLICATOR. You may also want to add the Replicator Service to
   the list of services started automatically in the [server] section of
   the LANMAN.INI file, per the following example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      srvservices = alerter,netlogon,replicator
</PRE><P>
</OL><h3>On The Windows NT Server</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create the replication account in User Manager for Domains, making sure
   that the username and password match the account being used on the LAN
   Manager server. Also, make sure that all options requiring user
   intervention (such as User Must Change Password at Next Logon) are
   disabled.

<P><LI>Add the replication username to the Domain Users, Backup Operators, and
   Replicator groups and exit User Manager for Domains.

<P><LI>Start the Services option in Control Panel and from the Service list,
   select Directory Replicator. Then choose the Startup button.

<P><LI>Under Startup Type, select the Automatic option button.

<P><LI>Under Log On As, select the This Account option button and choose the
   ... button to open the Add User window and obtain the Names list.

<P><LI>Select the replicator account from the Names list, choose the Add
   button, and then choose the OK button.

<P><LI>Under Log On As, enter the password for the replicator account in the
   Password box, re-enter the password in the Confirm Password box, and
   choose the OK button and then the Close button to close the Services
   window.

<P><LI>Run the Server option in Control Panel, choose the Replication button,
   select the Export Directories option button, and verify that the path
   shown in the From Path box is correct. For example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      C:\WINNT\SYSTEM32\REPL\EXPORT
</PRE>
<P><LI>From the Directory Replication window (opened in step 8 ), choose the
   Add button under the To List field, select the name of the LAN Manager
   server or the domain in which the LAN Manager server resides from the
   Select Domain list, and then choose the OK button to close the Select
   Domain window. Choose the OK button to close the Directory Replication
   window and choose the OK button to close the Server window.
<P>
</OL>10.Start the Services option in Control Panel again and from the Service
<PRE>   list select Directory Replicator. Choose the Start button to start the
   Directory Replicator service and then choose the OK button to close the
   Services window.

</PRE></OL>11.Start the Servers option in Control Panel again and choose the Shares
<PRE>   button to view replication activity when it occurs. You can view the
   replication session establishment in the Connected Users box by watching
   for a username using the REPL$ share.

</PRE><h3>If Replication Does Not Occur</h3>
 
<P>
Follow these steps if an initial replication does not occur.

<OL><P><LI>Stop and restart the Directory Replicator service via the Services
   option in Control Panel on the Windows NT server and check for any
   errors in Event Viewer. If no errors regarding this service exist,
   proceed to step 11 above to watch for replication to occur.

<P><LI>Stop and restart the Replicator service on the LAN Manager server
   by issuing the following commands in succession:
<P>
<P><PRE>      NET STOP REPLICATOR
      NET START REPLICATOR
</PRE><P>
   After issuing these commands on the LAN Manager server, you should see
   the file OK$ in the import directory of the LAN Manager server.

<P><LI>If replication problems persist, check Event Viewer on the Windows NT
   server and the error log on the LAN Manager server (using the command
   NET ERROR) for indications of specific error conditions related to
   replication.
