<P>
This article addresses the following questions regarding the Windows NT
printer drivers:

<UL><LI>Who writes Windows NT printer drivers?
<LI>Where are the printer drivers available from Microsoft?
<LI>What if Microsoft does not have the printer driver?
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Who Writes Windows NT Printer Drivers?</h3>
 
<P>
Windows NT printer drivers are developed through the cooperation between
Microsoft and the independent hardware vendor (IHV) that manufactures the
print device. Microsoft's role is to assist IHVs with programming and
testing of the printer driver's interaction with Windows NT. The role of
the IHV is to assist Microsoft in addressing either the general features
or the entire feature set of the print device.
<P>
<P><h3>Where Are the Printer Drivers Available from Microsoft?</h3>
 
<P>
Windows NT supports all print devices listed in the latest Hardware
Compatibility List (HCL). A copy of the HCL is located in the Support
directory on the Windows NT compact disc. For the most recent HCL, see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../winnt/q131303.htm">Q131303</A></B>
   TITLE     : Latest Windows NT Hardware Compatibility List

</PRE>If a print device is not listed in the HCL and there is a high demand for
printer support in Windows NT, Microsoft can work with the IHV to make the
printer drivers available. To make your need for a particular driver known
to Microsoft, please see step 3 in the "What If Microsoft Does Not Have
the Printer Driver?" section below.
<P>
New drivers are placed on the Microsoft Download Service (MSDL) under the
Windows NT Driver Library (WNTDL). The phone number for the MSDL is (425)
936-6735. For a list of the latest drivers, see the following articles in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../winnt/q100654.htm">Q100654</A></B>
   TITLE     : Windows NT 3.51 Driver Library
   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../winnt/q142643.htm">Q142643</A></B>
   TITLE     : Windows NT 4.0 Driver Library


</PRE>Other locations of the printer drivers are as follows:

<UL><LI>Internet (anonymous FTP)
<P><PRE>      ftp ftp.microsoft.com
      Change to the Softlib/Mslfiles folder.
      Get &lt;FILENAME&gt;.EXE
</PRE>
<LI>Microsoft's World Wide Web Site on the Internet
<P><PRE>      On the www.microsoft.com home page, click the Support icon.
      Click Knowledge Base, and select the product.
      Enter kbfile &lt;FILENAME&gt;.EXE, and click GO!
      Open the article, and click the button to download the file.
</PRE><P>
</UL>If the printer drivers are not on the locations listed above, determine if
the print device supports PostScript. Nearly all PostScript print devices
ship with a PostScript Printer Description (PPD) file that can be used to
add support for the print device. Microsoft does not support PPD files
from OEM vendors. Contact your manufacturer for information about PPD
files for your postscript printer.
<P>
For instructions on installing a PPD file in Windows NT 3.51, please see
the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../winnt/q142057.htm">Q142057</A></B>
   TITLE     : How to Install PPD Files from PostScript Printer
               Manufacturers

</PRE><h3>What If Microsoft Does Not Have the Printer Driver?</h3>
 
<P>
If Microsoft does not have the printer driver:

<OL><P><LI>Find a printer driver emulation that can provide the correct output. If
   your printer is a new model, you may want to try the driver for the
   previous model.

<P><LI>Contact the printer manufacturer to see if they have a Windows NT
   printer driver. Some printer manufacturers do develop drivers for
   Windows NT.

<P><LI>Indicate your desire for a printer driver by sending e-mail to
   ntwish@microsoft.com. Do not include technical support questions in the
   e-mail to ntwish; include only the manufacturer of the printer, and the
   make and model. Microsoft will use this information to gauge demand for
   a particular printer driver.
<P>
   NOTE: Sending mail to ntwish in no way guarantees that a driver for your
   printer will be written by Microsoft. Additionally, you will not receive
   a reply to any e-mail sent to ntwish.
<P>
