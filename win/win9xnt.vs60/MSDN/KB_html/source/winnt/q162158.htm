<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you type NET ACCOUNTS /SYNC at the command prompt, you may receive
either of the following error messages:
<P>
<PRE>   System error 1717 has occurred.
   The interface is unknown.

   -or-

   System error 50 has occurred.
   The network request is not supported.

</PRE>All the other NET ACCOUNTS switches may generate the following error:
<P>
<PRE>   The request will be processed at the primary domain controller for
   domain &lt;domain_name&gt;. Could not find domain controller for this domain.
   More help is available by typing NET HELPMSG 2453.

</PRE>When you type NET NELPMSG 2453 you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Could not find domain controller for this domain.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
You receive the first error message above (system error 1717) when the
Netlogon service is not running correctly on the computer from which the
command was run. The NET ACCOUNTS /SYNC command is supported on a primary
or backup domain controller. Although it is not supported on a member
server or a workstation, the same error can occur if the Netlogon service
has been stopped.
<P>
NOTE: All NET ACCOUNTS switches, other than /SYNC, can be successfully run
on the primary domain controller (PDC), even when the Netlogon service is
not running.
<P>
The second error message above (system error 50) can occur when the NET
ACCOUNTS /SYNC command is run on a member server or workstation. The /SYNC
switch is only supported on a domain controller.
<P>
The third error message above may result when the NET ACCOUNTS command is
run on a backup domain controller (BDC), a member server, or a workstation
if the Netlogon service is not running correctly on the PDC. Unlike the
/SYNC switch, the other switches do not require the Netlogon service to be
running on the computer from which the command was run.
<P>
The fourth error message above occurs if Windows NT cannot find the domain
controller for the domain. The task cannot be completed unless the domain
controller runs in the domain.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve these problems, start the Netlogon service on the domain
controller.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
You can use the NET ACCOUNTS command to synchronize the user account
database within a domain, and to set some policies. For all of the switches
of the command to work properly, the Netlogon service must be running
correctly on the primary and backup domain controllers.
<P>
The following is the syntax of the NET ACCOUNTS command:
<P>
<PRE>   NET ACCOUNTS [/FORCELOGOFF:{minutes | NO}] [/MINPWLEN:length]
                [/MAXPWAGE:{days | UNLIMITED}] [/MINPWAGE:days]
                [/UNIQUEPW:number] [/DOMAIN]
   NET ACCOUNTS [/SYNC]
