The information in this article applies to:

<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause
<PRE>    serious, system-wide problems that may require you to
    reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft cannot
    guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of
    Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own
    risk.


</PRE><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
You cannot access Clipbook pages that were created on the computer to
which you are logged on unless you created them. If you try to copy a
page, a message is displayed telling you that the computer storing the
page cannot be connected to.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When you create a Clipbook page, the default security applied to the
page is Full Control for the Creator or Owner (you) and Read And Link
for Everyone. If you share a page on the network, these permissions
are preserved, making the page accessible for reading and linking to
anyone who can connect to the sharing computer. However, even though
the page grants permissions to Everyone, only the Creator or Owner of
the page can access it locally. This is because the page is not
trusted by any other users. This is because each Network DDE share (a
Clipbook page for example) requires the currently logged-on user to
trust it before it can be accessed by even that user.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, you can establish the Clipbook page as a
trusted share. To do so, you need to modify the Registry:
<P>
NOTE: You can also call the AddTrustedShare API from a program.
<P>

<OL><P><LI>Log on to the computer with the shared Clipbook page using an
   account that has administrative privileges.

<P><LI>Start Registry Editor (REGEDT32.EXE).

<P><LI>Go to
<P>
<P><PRE>      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\NetDDE\DDE Shares
</PRE><P>
   and note the SerialNumber and ShareDBInstance values.

<P><LI>Go deeper by choosing DDE Shares and note the name of the ShareName
   value in the CLPBK$ key.

<P><LI>Log off. Log on to your usual user account. Start Registry Editor
   again.

<P><LI>Go to the following subkey
<P>
<P><PRE>      HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\NetDDE
      \DDE Trusted Shares\DDEDBixxxxxx
</PRE><P>
   where xxxxxx is the ShareDBInstance under the key referenced in
   Step 3.

<P><LI>From the Edit menu, choose Add Key. Enter the name found in Step 3.

<P><LI>From the Edit menu, choose Add Value for each of the following
   values and enter the appropriate information:
<P>
<PRE>      Name           Data Type    Value
   ---------------------------------------------------------------
      InitAllowed    REG_DWORD    0x1
      SerialNumber   REG_BINARY   &lt;serial number from Step 4&gt;
      StartApp       REG_DWORD    0x0

</PRE></OL>NOTE: Any changes to the shared Clipbook page result in the serial
number in Step 4 changing. If this happens, you need to update the
SerialNumber value in Step 8.
