The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
A power break occurs and the UPS (uninterruptable power supply)
service maintains the system for a short time. The UPS service
times-out and terminates before power returns or the system can be
prepared for shutdown. It also pauses the Windows NT Server service.
<P>
-or-
<P>
A power break occurs and power is restored before the battery runs
out. However, the UPS service times-out and terminates, leaving the
system vulnerable to the next power break (also pausing the Server
service).
<P>
In both cases, the following events are logged:
<P>
<PRE>   Event ID: 258
   Source:   UPS
   Type:     Error
   Error:    The description for Event ID (258) in Source (UPS) could
             not be found.

   Event ID: 3230
   Source:   UPS
   Type:     Warning
   Error:    A power failure was detected at the server.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Your UPS device does not have a low battery signal (or it was
disabled) and, instead of handling this properly, the UPS service
terminates prematurely. The problem is in the UPS service.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
In either case, you should contact Microsoft Product Support Services
for an updated UPS.EXE file. If your UPS and Server services are
currently paused, restart them by choosing Services from Control
Panel.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT and Windows NT
Advanced Server version 3.1. This problem was corrected in the latest U.S.
Service Pack for Windows NT and Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1. For
information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word in
