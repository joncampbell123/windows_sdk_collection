The information in this article applies to:

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes the 3Com Fast EtherLink and the 3Com EtherLink III
Bus Master Adapters Configuration and Diagnostic Program instructions.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The configuration portion of the program allows you to change the
configuration parameters for the adapter. This allows the adapter to fit
the specific environment in which it is installed.
<P>
The diagnostic portion of the Configuration and Diagnostic Program is
designed to make sure the adapter is installed correctly and functioning
properly in your computer. The Group 1 tests check the physical components,
connectors, and circuitry of the adapter and require only that the adapter
be installed in the computer. The Group 2 tests check the adapter's ability
to transmit data on the network and require that the adapter be connected
to a loopback plug or to a network. The Group 3 tests check the adapter's
ability to correctly transmit and receive data over the network and require
that the adapter be connected to a network on which an echo server has been
set up.
<P>
The computer containing the adapter to be configured or tested must be
running MS-DOS only.
<P>
NOTE: If this computer is an operating server, notify all users of the
server to save their work and log off the network. The Configuration and
Diagnostic Program disrupts the normal operation of servers and
workstations, so work that is not saved may be lost.
<P>
Shut down the server, and reboot with an MS-DOS only disk. This way no
drivers or TSRs will be running when the program is started.
<P>
<P><h3>Starting the Configuration and Diagnostic Program</h3>
 
<P>
There are two ways to start the program:

<UL><LI>Automatically, from the Install.exe program, by selecting the options in
   the Configuration and Diagnostic submenu.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Manually, from the root directory of the EtherDisk disk, by typing the
   following command:
<P>
<P><PRE>       3C59XCFG [command keyword] [parameter list]
</PRE><P>
   3C59XCFG represents the 3Com Configuration and Diagnostic Program name.
   The brackets indicate that the command keyword and parameter list are
   optional.
<P>
   3C59XCFG without any arguments invokes the program in full Windows mode.
   This includes mouse support and context-sensitive help. You can press F1
   for help at any time.
<P>
</UL><h3>Command-Line Keywords</h3>
 
<P>
You can use the first two characters of any command or parameter as a
shortcut. For example, 3C59XCFG HE RU means 3C59XCFG HELP RUN. Also, the
command keywords and parameters are not case-sensitive. See below for a
list of command-line keywords and their descriptions.
<P>
<PRE>   Keyword      Description
   ------------------------

   Configure    Configures an adapter in one of three ways:
                1. Automatically with /auto parameter
                2. Using a specified adapter configuration file
                3. Using command-line configuration parameters

   Echoserver   Enables a designated adapter to function within the echo
                server.

   Help         Displays general or command-specific help information. To
                get command-specific help, type:

                   3C59XCFG Help [command keyword]

   Language     Invokes the program in full Windows mode using a specified
                external resource file. This option provides support for
                multiple languages via a different resource file for each
                language supported.

   List         Displays a list of installed adapters recognized by this
                program and their assigned adapter numbers.

   Run          Runs the diagnostic tests (which can also be specified
                from a file) on a selected adapter and writes the results
                to the screen, a file, or a printer.

</PRE><h3>CONFIGURATION</h3>
 
<P>
The adapter can be configured in one of the following four ways, which are
described in greater detail below:

<UL><LI>Full-Screen Windows Mode

<LI>Command Line with Auto Configuration

<LI>Command Line with Explicit Parameters

<LI>Command Line with Configuration File
<P>
   Full Screen Windows Mode
   ------------------------
<P>
   To configure the adapter using the full-screen windowing, type
<P>
<P><PRE>      3C59XCFG
</PRE><P>
   and press ENTER. Then click Configure Adapter on the Install menu.
<P>
   Command Line Options
   --------------------
<P>
   Defaults: Configure has /Auto and /Adapternum:1 as defaults. For
   example, if only "3C59XCFG Configure" is used, adapter 1 will be
   automatically configured.
<P>
   /Adapternum:&lt;N&gt; specifies the adapter number to be configured for PCI
   and EISA computers. Run the LIST command separately to determine the
   adapter number to use here.
<P>
   /Slot:&lt;S&gt; specifies the physical slot number of the adapter to be
   configured in EISA computers.
<P>
   NOTE: The /Adapternum:&lt;N&gt; and /Slot:&lt;S&gt; parameters can be used with any
   of the Configure options that follow. They are both intended for use
   whenever multiple adapters are present in the computer and recognized by
   the Configuration and Diagnostic Program.
<P>
   Command Line with Auto Configuration
   ------------------------------------
<P>
   Command syntax: 3C59XCFG Configure /Auto
<P>
   The /Auto parameter configures the adapter to automatically select the
   media type. All other option settings are left unchanged.
<P>
   NOTE: To set the media type, the program will attempt to detect what
   media type is being used. Therefore, you should connect to the network
   first, then run /Auto, and it will configure the media type for you.
<P>
   Command Line with Explicit Parameters
   -------------------------------------
<P>
   Command syntax:  3C59XCFG Configure [/Bsize:&lt;N&gt; /Xcvr:&lt;N&gt; /Tr:&lt;N&gt;
<PRE>                    /Fullduplex:&lt;N&gt; /Optimize:&lt;N&gt; /Linkbeat:&lt;N&gt;]

   Command-line configuration parameters are used to configure the adapter
   using only the option settings you specify. Some parameters are for all
   adapters, while others are for PCI only. For example, /Bsize:&lt;N&gt; is a
   PCI- only parameter, because with EISA adapters, the computer vendor's
   configuration utility or the option disk handles the setting of the Boot
   PROM size. In most cases, any combination of parameters can be used.
   Therefore, it is possible to modify only a few settings if needed. See
   below for a list of parameters.

      Parameter       Description
      ---------------------------

      /Bsize          Boot PROM Size (PCI only).
                      Possible values - 8, 16, 32, 64, Disabled.

      /Tr (or /Xcvr)  Transceiver (PCI only).
                      Possible values - 100BASE-TX, Tp, 10BASE-T (same as
                      Tp), Coax, Aui, External (same as Aui).

      /Optimize       Network Driver Optimization.
                      Possible values - Normal, Network, Cpu.

      /Linkbeat       Link beat enable/disable (pre-10BASE-T standard
                      only).
                      Possible values - Enabled, Disabled.

                      NOTE: Try this setting ONLY if pre-10BASE-T standard
                      hubs are in use.

      /Fullduplex     Full duplex enable or disable (for 10BASE-T only).
                      Possible values - Enabled, Disabled.

                      NOTE: Enable this setting ONLY when the adapter is
                      connected to a 10BASE-T repeater supporting full
                      duplex.
                      Otherwise, it will bring down the network.

   Command Line with Configuration File
   ------------------------------------

   Command syntax: 3C59XCFG Configure /Configfile:&lt;filename&gt;

   This syntax is used to configure an adapter with the settings specified
   in an ASCII configuration file that can be created and modified by any
   text editor. The file name can be a fully qualified MS-DOS file name
   including a path. A standard format for the file must be used, as
   follows:

    - Variable names and values should match the wording in the full-screen
      configuration window in most cases.

    - Each variable or value line should begin with an "at" symbol (@),
      followed by a variable name, a colon (:), and the value.

      For example: @Media type: 100BASE-TX

    - Any comment lines should start with a semicolon (;).

    - Blank lines and other white space is allowed between variable lines.

    - The variable names allowed are:

         Boot PROM size
         Media type
         Network driver optimization
         Full Duplex
         Link beat

    - The values allowed are the same as those shown in the full-screen
      configuration window.

      Example 1: @Network driver optimization:Normal
      Example 2: @Media type:On-board Coax

</PRE></UL><h3>DIAGNOSTICS</h3>
 

<UL><LI>Full screen Windows mode:
<P>
   To run the diagnostic tests using full-screen windowing, type
   "3C59XCFG" (without the quotes) and press ENTER. Then click Run Tests on
   the Tests menu.

<LI>Command-line option:
<P>
   Command syntax: 3C59XCFG Run [/Testfile:&lt;filename&gt;]
   [/RESULTS:[&lt;filename&gt; | PRN | PRNHP]] [/ADAPTERNUM:&lt;N&gt; | /SLOT:&lt;S&gt;]
<P>
   The Run parameter runs the diagnostic tests on a selected adapter
   and displays the results on the screen. The defaults are Adapter 1 and
   Group 1 tests. The parameters below are all optional.
<P>
<P><PRE>      /Testfile:&lt;filename&gt; specifies a test file that contains a specific
      test setup description.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      /Results:[&lt;filename&gt; or PRN or PRNHP] specifies an alternative
      location to store the test results. This location can be an MS-DOS
      path and filename, PRN printer port (same as LPT1), or PRNHP, which
      is an HP LaserJet printer connected to LPT1.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      /Adapternum:&lt;N&gt; specifies the adapter number to be tested, in the
      case of multiple adapters installed in the computer and recognized by
      this program. Run the List command separately (see List below) to
      determine the adapter number to use.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      /Slot:&lt;S&gt; specifies the physical slot number of the adapter to be
      tested when multiple adapters are installed in EISA computers.
</PRE><P>
</UL><h3>OTHER COMMAND LINE OPTIONS</h3>
 

<UL><LI>Help
<P>
   Command syntax: 3C59XCFG Help [Command Keyword]
<P>
   Help is an online summary of commands. Without a command keyword, it
   gives a summary of the command keywords. With a command keyword
   specified, it gives the parameter choices for that particular command.
   For example, "3C59XCFG Help Configure" gives details about the parameter
   options for the Configure command.

<LI>Language
<P>
   Command syntax: 3C59XCFG Language /Langfile:&lt;filename&gt;
<P>
   Language invokes the program in full Windows mode using a specified
   external resource file. This option provides support for multiple
   languages via a different resource file for each language supported.
<P>
   This command requires the /Langfile:&lt;filename&gt; parameter. The
   file name is the name of the resource file that is loaded by the
   program. The file name can be a fully qualified MS-DOS file name.
<P>
   NOTE: At this time, there are no alternate resource files included on
   the EtherDisk disk.

<LI>List
<P>
   Command syntax: 3C59XCFG List
<P>
   List displays a list of currently installed adapters (and their assigned
   adapter numbers) that are recognized by this program. The adapter number
   is then used as the &lt;N&gt; value for the /Adapternum:&lt;N&gt; parameter when
   multiple adapters are installed. There are no parameters associated with
   the List command keyword.

<LI>Echoserver
<P>
   Command syntax: 3C59XCFG Echoserver [/Adapternum:&lt;N&gt; | /Slot:&lt;S&gt;]
<P>
   Echoserver enables an adapter to function within an echo server.
   In the case of multiple adapters, /Adapternum:&lt;N&gt; specifies the adapter
   number to be configured in the echo server. The /Slot:&lt;S&gt; parameter is
   available only on EISA computers, and refers to the physical slot in the
   echo server where the adapter is located.
<P>
