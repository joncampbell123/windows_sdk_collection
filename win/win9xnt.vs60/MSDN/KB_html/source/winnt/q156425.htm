</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
As with Windows NT 3.x, an LMHOSTS file can be imported during installation
to enable a computer running Windows NT Workstation 4.0 or Windows NT
Server 4.0 to join a domain across a router when WINS is not available to
facilitate name resolution. The TCP/IP configuration options presented
during setup depend on whether DHCP client support is selected on the
client.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If the TCP/IP protocol is selected in the "Installing Windows NT
Networking" phase of Windows NT Setup, the user is prompted with the
question:
<P>
<PRE>   If there is a DHCP server on your network, TCP/IP can be configured to
   dynamically provide an IP address. If you are not sure, ask your System
   Administrator. Do you wish to use DHCP? Yes/No.

</PRE>If the YES option is selected, the TCP/IP configuration dialog is
bypassed, along with the ability to configure the following:

<UL><LI>Import an LMHOSTS file.
<P>

   Knowledge base:

</PRE><LI>Manually specify WINS server address (useful if you want multiple domain
   controllers to register with the same WINS server).

<LI>Enable TCP/IP routing.

<LI>Define DNS address and domain name.
<P>
</UL>The TCP/IP configuration information can be configured with DHCP enabled by
clicking the "Back" button two times from the following dialogue box:
<P>
<PRE>   Windows NT is now ready to start the network so that you can complete
   the installation of networking. Click Next to start the network. Click
   Back to stop the network if it is running.

</PRE>Click the Back button two times to go back to the TCP/IP Properties screen.
Here, you can choose to import the LMHOSTS file.
<P>
Unlike previous versions of Windows NT, the LMHOSTS file can be accessed
from any locally available device (floppy disk drive, hard disk drive,
CD-ROM drive) during setup instead of the root directory of a:\.
<P>
NOTE: After the LMHOSTS file has been imported and networking has been
initialized, it cannot be reimported. Even though it is possible to back
up and tell the installation process to reimport LMHOSTS, it will not be
written to the cache. If the wrong LMHOSTS file is imported (for whatever
reason) the installation will have to be restarted from the very
beginning. There is also no way to remotely purge and reload the cache.
