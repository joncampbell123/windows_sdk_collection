The information in this article applies to:

<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 and 4.0

<P>
The "netstat -s" command can be used to view various TCP/IP protocol
statistics.
<P>
Windows NT systems that are running on a TCP/IP network with more than one
logical subnet per physical network may display a large number of IP
Received Header Errors, as shown below:

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When an IP datagram is received as a broadcast at the link level, it is
passed up to IP to process. IP performs a check to see if the datagram is
a valid IP broadcast for a subnet that the computer is configured on. If
the datagram is not a valid subnet broadcast, it is discarded, and the
"IP Received Header Errors" count is incremented.
<P>
This is a harmless error, but a request has been logged to eliminate this
behavior in future versions of Windows NT.
