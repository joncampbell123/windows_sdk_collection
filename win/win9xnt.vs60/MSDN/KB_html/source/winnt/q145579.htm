The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Windows NT 3.x it was possible, using File Manager, to view, create,
edit and delete shares on a remote Windows NT computer, provided you had
sufficient privileges. This facility is not available by default from
Windows NT Explorer in Windows NT 4.0.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This is by design. Windows NT Explorer was designed as a browsing tool with
limited administrative functionality.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
You may use any or all of the following resolutions:
<P>
<P><h3>Use File Manager Included with Windows NT 4.0</h3>
 
<P>
A Windows NT 4.0 version of File Manager is included in Windows NT 4.0 and
can be used to view, create, delete, or change share permissions on shares
that are not local to the computer in the same way this was done in earlier
versions of Windows NT.
<P>
<P><h3>Install the Shareui Utility from the Windows NT 4.0 Resource Kit</h3>
 
<P>
To get the equivalent functionality with Windows NT Explorer, you must
install a utility from the Windows NT 4.0 Resource Kit. After installing
the resource kit, locate the directory to which you installed it, right-
click the file named Shareui.inf and select Install. You may now view,
create, edit, and delete shares on remote computers using the following
steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click Start, Run, and type on the Run line the UNC name of the server
   you wish to administer, as in the following example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      \\&lt;servername&gt;
</PRE>
<P><LI>Click OK, and you should now see a folder called Shared Directories.

<P><LI>Double-click this folder and it will show you any existing shares on the
   remote computer. You can right-click this window and select New, and
   then select Share to create a new share, or right-click on an existing
   share to Delete, Rename, or change permissions (through the share
   Properties) on that share.
<P>
</OL><h3>Administrative Wizard on Windows NT 4.0 Server</h3>
 
<P>
Another possible workaround on Windows NT Server is to use the
Administrative Wizard, "Managing File and Folder Access."
<P>
To run this wizard, click Start, Programs, Administrative Tools,
Administrative Wizards, and then click on "Managing File and Folder Access"
and follow the instructions. This option can also be run separately by
running Shrpubw.exe located in the %SystemRoot%\System32 subdirectory.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
For more information on the Shareui utility, see the Windows NT 4.0
Resource Kit Help file for information on shareui.
