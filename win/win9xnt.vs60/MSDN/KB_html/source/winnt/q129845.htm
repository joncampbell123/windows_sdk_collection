<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When a STOP message (fatal system error) occurs in Windows NT, it enters
debug mode for troubleshooting purposes. This appears as a blue screen and
the first few lines look similar to the following:
<P>
<PRE>   Stop 0x0000001e (c000009a 80123f36 02000000 00000246)
   Unhandled Kernel exception c000009a from 8123f26
   Address 80123f36 has base at 80100000 - ntoskrnl.exe

</PRE>The following are two procedures to assist you in identifying the cause of
the STOP message before you contact Microsoft Product Support.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Knowledge Base</h3>
 
<P>
The Knowledge Base contains many articles that explain specific STOP
messages and often, resolutions to or ways to work around the problem.
Search the Knowledge Base for at least the first hexadecimal number. For
example, in the example above, that is "0x0000001e". It also may be
helpful to search on the identified file name and other hexadecimal
numbers.
<P>
<P><h3>Saving STOP Messages to File</h3>
 
<P>
You can configure Windows NT to save STOP message information to a "dump"
file, Memory.dmp. If you need to contact Microsoft Product Support, this
will help you give us the specific information we need to identify the
problem.
<P>
Saving STOP message information to file is enabled by default in Windows
NT Server. However, for Windows NT Workstation, you must enable the option
manually. This must be done prior to encountering a fatal error for the
information to be recorded. To enable this feature, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>In the System component of Control Panel, choose the Recovery button.

<P><LI>Select the Write Debugging Information To check box.

<P><LI>Choose OK until you are asked to restart the computer.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: The paging file must be at least as large as the amount of physical
RAM installed in your computer. The paging file must reside in the active
partition. There must be adequate room for the Memory.dmp file to be
created.
<P>
<P><h3>Memory.dmp File</h3>
 
<P>
If a STOP message appears and a Memory.dmp file is created, a Microsoft
support engineer may be able to debug the dump file. Call Microsoft
Product Support, describe the STOP message to the support engineer and
explain that you have a dump file.
<P>
You may be asked to send your Memory.dmp file to Microsoft if the support
engineer is not able to solve the problem over the phone. If so, compress
the file with an application such as PKZIP. Memory.dmp files usually
compress significantly. Use one of the following options to upload the
file:

<UL><LI>Send your compressed Memory.dmp file by FTP to ftp.microsoft.com. This
   requires FTP access to the Internet. The support engineer will explain
   how to place your file on the FTP server. The server TCP/IP address
   is:
<P>
<P><PRE>      198.105.232.1
</PRE>
<LI>Upload your compressed Memory.dmp file from the Microsoft Support File
   Exchange BBS. The support engineer will explain how to upload the file
   and what telephone number to use.

<LI>Back up your Memory.dmp file to tape using NTBackup and mail the tape
   to the support engineer.

<LI>Copy the file to a writeable compact disc and mail it to the support
   engineer.

<LI>If none of the above options are feasible, the support engineer may be
   able to use Remote Access Service (RAS) to access your computer and
   examine or copy the Memory.dmp file. Follow these steps to prepare your
   computer for a Microsoft support engineer to access it with RAS:
<P>
   1. Create a temporary user account that a Microsoft support engineer
<P><PRE>      can use when accessing the Memory.dmp file.
</PRE><P>
   2. On another server, create a share and give this new user account
<P><PRE>      access to this share.
</PRE><P>
   3. Copy the newly created Memory.dmp file to this new share.
<P>
   4. If you don't have RAS installed at your site, install RAS on an
<P><PRE>      Windows NT Server or Workstation. For security, you can install RAS
      on a computer and allow remote clients to connect only to that
      computer, not the network. If you do this, create the new network
      share on this computer and copy the Memory.dmp file there.
</PRE><P>
   5. Allow the support engineer user ID access to dial in to the RAS
<P><PRE>      server.
</PRE><P>
   6. Give the support engineer the username, password, domain name,
<P><PRE>      server name, share name, and phone number for the modem line.
