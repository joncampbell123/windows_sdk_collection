<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5 and 3.51
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5 and 3.51
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOM</h2>
 
<P>
After you start a non-interactive application with the AT.EXE scheduler
program, one or more of the following symptoms occur:

<UL><LI>The application appears to hang.

<LI>The application remains loaded in memory even though it should quit.

<LI>You are unable to quit the application.

<LI>You can see the process with Process Viewer but Process Viewer is unable
   to kill it.

<LI>If the application is trying to access a device, for example a tape
   drive, you cannot access the device until the application is cleared
   from memory.

<LI>Memory is not freed if the application fails, and if different
   applications are hung in memory, system performance degrades.

<LI>Some applications allow multiple instances; and if they do not clear
   from memory, performance degrades.
<P>
</UL>NOTE: Applications you start with the AT.EXE command, by design, do not
appear in Task Manager.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To remove the non-interactive application from memory after it does not
quit, do one of the following:

<UL><LI>Reboot your computer.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Use the Windows NT Resource Kit utilities TLIST.EXE and KILL.EXE. These
   utilities allow the administrator to detect and then clear the
   application from memory based on the application Process ID.
<P>
</UL>Tlist.exe and Kill.exe utilities are available in the Windows NT
Resource Kit versions 3.1, 3.5, and 3.51. Help for both utilities is
available from the command line. (For a hung process use the Kill -f
Option.)
<P>
NOTE: AT Scheduler has no way to control an application already started.
