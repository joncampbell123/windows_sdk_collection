The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
You may receive an Access Violation in Dns.exe. This is most often occurs
on computers connected to public networks, such as the Internet, where
deliberate attacks are common.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This particular attack is usually generated maliciously by typing the
following command on the attacking system:
<P>
<PRE>   telnet &lt;mycomputer&gt; 19 | telnet &lt;mycomputer&gt; 53

</PRE>This command causes a telnet connection to be established to port 19 (the
chargen service, which generates a string of characters) with the output
redirected to a telnet connection to port 53 (the DNS service.) This flood
of characters causes an Access Violation in the DNS service, which is
terminated, disrupting name resolution services.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
