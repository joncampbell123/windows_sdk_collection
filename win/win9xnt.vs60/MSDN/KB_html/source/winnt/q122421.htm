The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The following problems occur on computers running Windows NT Advanced
Server version 3.1 or Windows NT Server version 3.5 with any token ring
card that allows setting the Transmit/Receive Buffer size:

<UL><LI>On a Windows NT Advanced Server computer, the server service randomly
   stops allowing new connections and appears to stop responding (hang).
   Any clients that are already connected hang if you try to do anything
   over their connections. At this point, you cannot pause or stop the
   server service (an hourglass appears). There are no errors in the event
   log, and the workstation service is still running.

<LI>On Windows NT Server installations, Event 2000 errors occur. When the
   workstation makes a request to establish a session, it receives a
   failure message from the server, stating that there is a lack of
   resources available.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
By default, the Madge card is optimized for workstations (8 Receive and 4
Transmit), not for servers.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
The Madge card has settings that are configurable for the Transmit and
Receive buffers. Increase the settings on the server to 12 Receive and 8
Transmit buffers as follows:

<OL><P><LI>Start the Network component of Control Panel

<P><LI>Select your Madge adapter in the Installed Adapter Cards box

<P><LI>Choose the Configure button

<P><LI>In the Rx/Tx Buffers box, select Rx=12 and Tx=6.
<P>
</OL>The Madge product included here is manufactured by Madge Networks, Inc.,
a vendor independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or
otherwise, regarding this product's performance or reliability.
