The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1

<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Print Manager in Windows NT version 3.5 does not maintain a default printer
tray selection as in Windows NT version 3.1.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Windows NT printing is forms-based. Windows NT checks the form being
printed on to discover what paper path to use. A form must be associated
with a paper tray to be printed on anything other than the default form
association. Once these associations are made, Windows NT is very flexible
in printing. For example, a form Letter could be associated with the Upper
Tray. Then a new form could be created with the same dimensions as Letter
but called Letterhead. Letterhead could be associated with the Lower Tray.
In use, one application could be a macro for a word processor that prints
using Letterhead as the first page and then Letter for the rest.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
A separate form is required for association with different printer paper
paths. To add a new paper path and form, use the following procedure:

<OL><P><LI>Run Print Manager.

<P><LI>From the Printer menu, choose Forms.

<P><LI>Scroll down the list of forms and select Letter.

<P><LI>Enter or replace Letter with one of the following under Form
   Description: Letter Lower Tray or Letterhead Lower Tray. Choose OK.
<P>
   NOTE: The names above are examples. You can use any name for the form.

<P><LI>From the Printer menu, choose Properties and then Setup.

<P><LI>Select the Paper Tray for form reassignment. Then assign the new form
   (Letter Lower Tray or Letterhead Lower Tray) to the paper tray. Choose
   OK.

<P><LI>To verify the changes, repeat Step 5 and select the Paper Tray.

<P><LI>Exit Print Manager and try printing again.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: The PostScript driver in Window NT 3.1 does not recognize multiple
paper paths and prints only from the default paper path. The Windows NT 3.5
PostScript driver recognizes multiple paper paths and will work as stated
above.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
One form cannot be associated with multiple paper paths. This is the most
common cause of difficulty when associating forms with a paper path. Print
Manager allows multiple path associations but only one will work. A common
example is the Letter form. The Letter form by default is associated with
the first paper path in the list of paper paths. Even though you can define
the Letter form for the Lower Tray, Windows NT still prints to the upper
tray since the Letter form was first associated with the Upper Tray. In
order to change the Letter form to use the Lower Tray, you must rename the
form and associate it with the Lower Tray or remove the association with
the Upper Tray.
