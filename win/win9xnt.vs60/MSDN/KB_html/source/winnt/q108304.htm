The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
You have fault tolerant partitions (such as Stripes with Parity and
Mirrors), but cannot access them and they appear in Disk Administrator as
type Unknown.
<P>
This problem may occur after you have replaced your boot drive and
installed Windows NT Advanced Server on it.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To avoid experiencing this problem, save the disk configuration whenever
there is a change, such as adding fault tolerance. You can do this in Disk
Administrator from the Partition menu by choosing Configuration, and then
choosing Save. This information can be used to restore the configuration if
it is lost by choosing Configuration from the Partition menu, and then
choosing Restore.
<P>
If the disk configuration was not saved or the information is not
available, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Obtain a copy of EDITREG.EXE, and run it on the server (type EDITREG).
<P>
   NOTE: EDITREG.EXE can be obtained from Microsoft Product Support.
<P>
   WARNING! EDITREG.EXE directly modifies data in the configuration
   Registry. It is considered unsupported, and should be used only as a
   last resort. Microsoft cannot guarantee the results of using this tool,
   and Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use
   of EDITREG can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.
<P>
   The following are definitions of EDITREG.EXE commands:
<P>
<P><PRE>      DISKS: reads the information stored in the Registry key
<PRE></PRE>         HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE-&gt;System-&gt;DISK.

      MAKEFT: writes into the information stored in the Registry key
         HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE-&gt;System-&gt;DISK.

</PRE><P><LI>At the prompt, type the following and press ENTER:
<P>
<P><PRE>      MAKEFT
</PRE>
<P><LI>Follow the prompts, taking care to conform to the following guidelines:
<P>
   a. FT Group Numbers start at 0, so if you have a mirror and a stripe
<P><PRE>      set, they will be FT Group 0 and 1
</PRE><P>
   b. Disks are numbered starting at disk 0, exactly as they appear in Disk
<P><PRE>      Administrator
</PRE><P>
   c. Partitions are numbered starting at 1
<P>
   d. When all components of that set are entered, hit return on the next
<P><PRE>      prompt
</PRE><P>
   e. Verify the information by typing DISKS
<P>
   f. Quit EDITREG.EXE

<P><LI>Shut down and reboot the computer.

<P><LI>Open Disk Administrator. Make sure the FT set is type Unknown, but will
   be color-coded as the correct FT type.

<P><LI>Assign a drive letter.

<P><LI>Shutdown and reboot

<P><LI>From CP Devices select FTDISK, STARTUP is set to Disable, click
   Startup botton and select "Start Type" as Boot, click OK. With FTDISK
   selected, click Start.

<P><LI>At this point the drive should be usable again.
