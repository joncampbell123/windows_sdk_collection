</UL> 
<P>
Windows NT TCP/IP Printing Services are based on the standard defined in
RFC1179, which contains the communication specification for line printer
remote (LPR) and line printer daemon (LPD) printing and is based on TCP/IP
printing with Berkeley versions of Unix. The Line Printer Daemon and its
components in RFC1179 are known as Berkeley Style Daemons (BSD). Some
versions of Unix only support System V TCP/IP printing, which is not
compatible with BSD RFC1179 TCP/IP printing.
<P>
In order for Windows NT to be able to print to a Unix server, the Unix
server must support Berkeley style TCP/IP printing daemons (some Unix
versions are configurable). The same is also true for Unix clients printing
to a Windows NT LPD server, the Unix client must support the Berkeley style
LPR daemon.
<P>
Reference(s):
<P>
For more information on LPR and LPD, see RFC1179. RFCs may be obtained from
the Internet as follows:
<P>
Paper copies of all RFCs are available from the NIC, either individually or
on a subscription basis (for more information contact NIC@NIC.DDN.MIL).
Online copies are available from FTP or Kermit from NIC.DDN.MIL as
RFC/RFC####.TXT or RFC/RFC####.PS (where #### is the RFC number without
leading zeroes).
<P>
Additionally, RFCs may be requested through electronic mail from the
automated NIC mail server by sending a message to SERVICE@NIC.DDN.MIL with
a subject line of "rfc ####" for text versions or a subject line of "rfc
####.PS" for PostScript versions. To obtain the RFC index, the subject line
of your message should read "rfc index".
