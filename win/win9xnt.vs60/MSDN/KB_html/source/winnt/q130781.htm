<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Your two-way trust between Domain1 and Domain2 may experience a failure in
one direction. Domain1 may receive the following error message in Event
Viewer:
<P>
<PRE>   Event ID   : 5770
   Source     : NetLogon
   Description: The session setup to the Windows NT Comain Controller
                &lt;PDC1&gt; from computer &lt;PDC2&gt; using account &lt;Domain2$&gt;
                failed. &lt;PDC1&gt; is declared to be a BDC in domain &lt;Domain1&gt;.
                However, &lt;PDC2&gt; tried to connect as either a DC in a
                trusted domain, a member workstation in domain &lt;Domain1&gt;,
                or as a server in domain &lt;Domain1&gt;. Use the Server Manager
                to remove the BDC account for &lt;PDC2&gt;.

   where PDCx is the primary domain controller of Domainx and BDC is backup
   domain controller.

</PRE>When you attempt to connect to the PDC of Domain2, you may receive the
following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   The trust relationship between the primary domain and the trusted domain
   failed.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
User Manager on the Domain1 PDC incorrectly assumes that the Domain2 PDC
is a Backup Domain Controller in Domain1 and sends a validation request to
it to verify its Security Accounts Management (SAM) database. When the
Domain2 PDC attempts to connect as a PDC, the validation request fails.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
In NT 3.1:
<P>
Go to Server Manager and delete the duplicate computer name from the list
of servers. This BDC will need to be re-installed if it will be brought up
on the network. Or, the PDC can be re-installed that has the duplicate
name.
<P>
In NT 3.5x / 4.0 :
<P>
If the BDC that is duplicated has been taken off the network, simply delete
the duplicate computer account from Server Manager on DOM1.
<P>
If the BDC and PDC need to coexist, the PDC (or BDC) can be renamed and
rebooted. The coinciding entry from Server Manager must also be removed as
a result.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
