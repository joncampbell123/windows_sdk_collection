<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Windows NT LPD Server is based on RFC1179, which defines the standard
for TCP/IP Printing using Berkeley Style Daemons (BSD). However, the
Windows NT LPD Server does not implement all incoming control characters
because of overlapping functionality which already is present in Windows
NT or because the control character is Unix-specific.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following format control characters as specified in RFC1179 are
implemented by Windows NT's LPD Server:
<P>
<PRE>   f - Print formatted file

   l - Print file leaving control characters

</PRE>Other LPR format control characters, such as 'o' for format file as
PostScript, can be emulated in Windows NT by setting the print queue's
Datatype to TEXT and using the proper printer driver. When the TEXT
Datatype is selected for a print queue, any incoming jobs are formatted
using the driver that is set up for the queue.
<P>
To emulate LPR jobs that send the 'o' control character, the print queue
should be set up to use the proper PostScript driver and the Datatype
should be set to TEXT. Then, any incoming jobs (regardless of source) will
be formatted using the PostScript driver. Thus, the 'o' control character
does not need to be implemented by LPD, as the Datatype already provides
this functionality.
<P>
Also, because the TEXT Datatype can use any Windows NT printer driver,
more functionality is provided than the control characters defined in
RFC1179, as there are several types of printers supported by Windows NT
whose formats are not specified in RFC1179.
<P>
Other LPR control characters, such as L for print banner page, can be
emulated in Windows NT by using the proper set up. To print a banner page,
set up the Windows NT Separator Page for the queue.
<P>
Some LPR control characters are Unix-specific, such as S for symbolic link
data, thus they cannot be emulated in Windows NT.
<P>
