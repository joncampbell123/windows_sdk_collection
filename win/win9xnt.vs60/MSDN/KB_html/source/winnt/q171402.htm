<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you select About Windows NT from the Help menu of a Windows NT
Explorer interface window, memory available to Windows NT only reports 2 GB
of RAM even though more than 2 GB of memory is installed. Windows NT Task
Manager's Performance tab and Windows NT Diagnostics Memory tab both report
the correct amount of RAM. This only appears after installing Windows NT
4.0 Service Pack 3.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This is a known problem and is simply a reporting error. Windows NT is
accessing and using all of the memory installed in the computer, as seen by
Windows NT Task Manager's Performance tab and Windows NT Diagnostics'
Memory tab.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
During testing, it was found that some applications functioned incorrectly
when having access to more than 2 GB of memory. The incorrect reporting of
the amount of RAM installed over 2 GB was intentionally implemented to
allow applications, which were written for a maximum of 2 GB of RAM, to
function properly.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0
Service Pack 3. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
