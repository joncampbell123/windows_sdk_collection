The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, and 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, and 4.0
<LI>Microsoft LAN Manager version 2.2c
</UL>

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When users attempt to manually change their passwords on a down-level LAN
Manager or LAN Server and a minimum password length policy is set, the
passwords are changed even if the new password has fewer than the required
minimum number of characters. This occurs regardless of whether users make
their attempts through the "net user/password" command from the command
prompt, or from the Change Password option in the Windows NT Security
dialog box (use CTRL+ALT+DELETE to get this dialog box).
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When a computer running Windows NT attempts to change the password, it
first attempts to create a pipe to the remote server. This action will
fail, forcing the computer to fall back on an older 16-bit API. The older
API used to change the password is not properly formatting the correct
length of the new password being sent to the remote server. The end result
is that a new password of the same length as the old password is created.
As long as the old password was longer than the minimum password length
policy, the new password is changed regardless of its length, including if
set to NULL.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this problem, obtain the following fix or wait for the next
Windows NT service pack.
<P>
<P><h3>Windows NT 4.0</h3>
 
<P>
The fix should have the following time stamp:
<P>
<PRE>   05/27/97 06:58 PM               227,088 Netapi32.dll (Intel)
   05/27/97 05:58 PM               367,376 Netapi32.dll (Alpha)

</PRE><h3>Windows NT 3.51</h3>
 
<P>
The fix should have the following time stamp:
<P>
<PRE>   4/30/97 9:49PM                  215,968 Netapi32.dll (Intel)
   4/30/97 9:52PM                  322,832 Netapi32.dll (Alpha)
   4/30/97 9:50PM                  339,216 Netapi32.dll (Mips)

</PRE>NOTE: Service Pack 3 must be applied to Windows NT 3.51 prior to applying
this fix.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
