<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you connect to a Windows NT 3.1 RAS server over Remote Access Services
(RAS) from a Windows NT 3.5 computer configured to use the Point-to-Point
(PPP) protocol, the following message appears:
<P>
<PRE>   You have connected successfully using an older Remote Access protocol.
   The remote server does not respond to the newer PPP protocols required
   to run native TCP/IP and IPX applications.

   Press Accept to use the connection as is, or Hang Up to disconnect.
   Press F1 for more information.

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The PPP protocol has become the standard for RAS. It is defined in RFC 1548
published by the Internet Engineering Task Force and other working groups.
PPP provides a standard method of sending network packets, or datagrams,
over a point to point link. This standard allows Windows NT 3.5 to support
the use of other protocols such as TCP/IP, NetBEUI, and IPX over RAS.
Windows NT version 3.1 does not support PPP. It only allows the use of
NetBEUI over RAS.
<P>
When a Windows NT 3.5 RAS computer connects to a Windows NT 3.1 RAS server
the following message appears:
<P>
<PRE>   RAS has connected using an earlier RAS protocol. The current entry is
   configured to use the PPP protocol; however, the RAS server you dialed
   in to is probably an earlier version of the Microsoft Remote Access
   Service and does not support PPP. The server also does not support
   clients using TCP/IP or IPX (native TCP/IP or IPX) to communicate
   directly to servers on the LAN.

   If you do not require PPP using native TCP/IP or IPX , click Accept to
   continue. If you require PPP using native TCP/IP or IPX, click the Hang
   Up button and try a server that supports PPP. To change the LAN
   protocols for this entry, click the Change button.

   If you expect the down-level server will be upgraded to Windows NT 3.5,
   which supports PPP, you should not change PPP configuration. Click
   accept each time this dialog appears. When the server is upgraded to use
   PPP, this entry will automatically use PPP before using the earlier RAS
   protocol and this dialog will not appear again.

   If you do not expect to upgrade your RAS servers you can prevent this
   message from appearing by changing the PPP configuration for this entry.
   Click the Change button and ensure no protocols are selected in the PPP
   box.

   This will not result in faster connections, but the Down-level Server
   dialog box will not appear.

</PRE>This message implies that it will continue to appear as long as the server
does not support PPP. The message will not continue to appear because the
negotiated protocol is saved as part of the phone book entry in
RASPHONE.PBK. The message also states when the server is upgraded,
connections will attempt to use PPP. If in fact the server is updated,
connections will be based on the previously saved protocol or NetBEUI. The
only way to get the connection to attempt to negotiate using PPP is to
delete the saved information. To do this, edit RASPHONE.PBK and find the
paragraph for the specific entry. Change the SkipDownLevelDialog setting
from 1 to 0.
