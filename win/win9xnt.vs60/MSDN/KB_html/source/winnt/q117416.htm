<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run Setup in Repair mode on a Windows NT installation that was
created using WINNT.EXE, from a share that has the CD-ROM i386 directory
copied as a flat directory, the repair process fails and the following
message appears:
<P>
<PRE>   Setup has determined that one or more Windows NT system files are
   missing or corrupt.

   These files cannot be repaired at this time because Setup was not
   started from an original Windows NT Setup floppy disk or CD-ROM. Contact
   your system administrator.

</PRE><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
You need an original Windows NT Setup floppy disk to complete the repair
process. You also need to manually edit the REPAIR.INF file on the
Emergency Repair Disk.
<P>
To correct this problem after you have received the above error message:

<OL><P><LI>Restart your computer with the Setup floppy disk.

<P><LI>Start Repair mode.

<P><LI>You will be prompted for the Emergency Repair Disk, and then for the
   Setup disk. From the available choices, select Verify Windows NT System
   Files, and then choose Continue.
<P>
   When Repair finds the corrupt file, the following message appears:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Please insert the disk labeled "Windows NT Setup CD-ROM" into
      drive A:
</PRE>
<P><LI>Note the file that is damaged. This will be displayed in the lower-right
   corner of the screen.

<P><LI>Press F3 to exit Setup - Repair, and then restart your computer

<P><LI>Load the REPAIR.INF file into a plain text editor, such as Notepad.

<P><LI>Search for the text string of the corrupt file (FASTFAT.SYS is used in
   this example). You should see the following entry:
<P>
<P><PRE>      \$WIN_NT$.~LS\FASTFAT.SYS,\winnt\system32\drivers\FASTFAT.SYS,
      "Windows NT Setup CD-ROM",eb703084
</PRE>
<P><LI>To edit the line, delete "\$WIN_NT$.~LS" from the beginning of the line,
   and replace the text "CD-ROM" with "Disk #6".
<P>
   The corrected line should look like this:
<P>
<P><PRE>      \FASTFAT.SYS,\winnt\system32\drivers\FASTFAT.SYS,"Windows NT Setup
      Disk #6",eb703084
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: This correct disk number can be found from a REPAIR.INF created
   from a floppy disk installation or by manually searching the disks.

<P><LI>Restart your computer with the Setup floppy disk, and then start Repair
   mode. This time you will be prompted for the correct disk.
<P>
</OL>Setup will continue and complete the repairs as expected.
<P>
NOTE: RISC-based computers require a CD-ROM drive, this should not be an
issue on these platforms.
