<P>
<P>
<P><h3>1.0  INTRODUCTION</h3>
 
Service Pack 3 for Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 is easy to install from within
Windows NT and changes only those files that were originally set up on the
Windows NT Workstation or Windows NT Server system. Service Pack releases
are cumulative: they contain all previous fixes and any new fixes made to
the system.
<P>
<P><h3>1.1  What's New in Service Pack 3</h3>
 
RPC Transport
<P>
This service pack includes new versions of the remote procedure call (RPC)
run-time dynamic-link library (DLL) and the RPC subsystem service
(Rpcss.exe). These changes provide enhanced support for RPC message
queuing, which is a feature of the upcoming Microsoft Message Queue Server
(MSMQ). In order to use message queuing in an RPC client/server application
on Windows NT 4.0, you must have Service Pack 3 installed on both the
client machine and the server machine. You also need Beta 2 or later of
MSMQ installed on both the client machine and the server machine.
<P>
If you are developing RPC applications that support MSMQ, you need the new
RPC run-time DLL, the new RPC subsystem service, and the new RPC header
files and Microsoft Interface Definition Language (MIDL) compiler
(available in the Win32 Software Development Kit). Also, RPC applications
must support message queuing in order to use the following new features:
<P>
The MIDL [message] attribute.
<P>
The ncadg_mq protocol sequence.
<P>
The RPC_C_MQ_* endpoint flags in the RPC_POLICY data structure.
<P>
The RpcBindingInqOption and RpcBindingSetOption functions.
<P>
For more information on using message queuing in your RPC applications, see
RPC Message Queuing in the Service Pack 3 SDK Help file (see "Win32 APIs
and SDK for Service Pack 3" later in this file), or refer to the
documentation in the upcoming MSMQ SDK.
<P>
CryptoAPI 2.0
<P>
The Microsoft Cryptography application programming interface (CryptoAPI)
provides developers with core cryptographic and certificate functions.
CryptoAPI 1.0 supports public-key and symmetric-key operations, such as key
generation, key management, key exchange, encryption, decryption, hashing,
digital signatures, and verification of signatures. CryptoAPI 2.0 (the
upgrade contained in this service pack) includes this core cryptographic
functionality as well as certificate-based functionality. Developers can
use certificates with these public-key operations and perform the
necessary encapsulations and encoding to apply certificates within their
applications.
<P>
CryptoAPI 2.0 uses a service-provider model in which cryptography is
provided by Cryptographic Service Providers (CSPs). This model allows
developers to easily adapt their applications to evolving cryptographic
technologies and government export policies. Service Pack 3 provides one
CSP (the Microsoft RSA Base Provider), which gives users and developers
access to exportable cryptography.
<P>
CryptoAPI 2.0 supports existing standards, such as X.509 v.3 certificate
formats, ASN.1 encoding, and both PKCS #7 and #10 for encapsulation. This
allows applications using CryptoAPI to operate with other certificate-based
systems that adhere to these standards.
<P>
The release version of CryptoAPI 2.0 contains several updates to the
developer's release version of September 1996, including both parameter
changes and naming changes. These changes are reflected in the Crypt32.dll
and Wincrypt.h files. Please consult the CryptoAPI 2.0 documentation for
details.
<P>
DirectX 3.0
<P>
Service Pack 3 contains a complete software implementation of DirectX 3.0
as well as ongoing hardware support for the DirectDraw component of DirectX
3.0. This translates into the following major feature changes since the
release of DirectX 2.0 as supported in Windows NT 4.0:
<P>
DirectDraw
Access to all 256 entries in the palette when in exclusive mode.
<P>
DirectSound
Software-based 3-D localization of audio (Direct3DSound APIs.)
<P>
DirectInput
COM interface supporting mouse and keyboard data with documentation and
sample programs.
<P>
DirectPlay
IDirectPlayLobby, an interface that allows an external application to
launch a DirectPlay 3.0 application and provide it with all information
necessary to connect to a session. Internet TCP/IP service provider for
multi-player applications over the Internet.
<P>
Direct3D
Software emulation for the Direct3D 3.0 API. (In Windows NT 4.0, we provide
a beta version of the software drivers for Direct3D 2.0.)
<P>
ODBC 3.0
<P>
Service Pack 3 includes the latest version of Microsoft Open Database
Connectivity (ODBC) API. ODBC 3.0 provides an updated ODBC Control Panel
and an ODBC Administrator interface that uses tabbed controls and provides
more information about the ODBC components installed and in use on your
system. This updated version of ODBC also introduces the concept of a file
data source that can be shared or placed on a central server. With the
appropriate drivers installed, ODBC 3.0 will let a user share a file data
source or place a file data source on a central server.
<P>
This new version of ODBC adheres to the standards of both the American
National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the International Standards
Organization (ISO). It is also backward compatible with previous versions
of the ODBC API. For more information on ODBC 3.0, refer to the
documentation included with the ODBC 3.0 SDK.
<P>
SMB Signing
<P>
Service Pack 3 includes an updated version of the Server Message Block
(SMB) authentication protocol, also known as the Common Internet File
System (CIFS) file sharing protocol. The updated protocol has two main
improvements: it supports mutual authentication, which closes a "man-in-the-
middle" attack, and it supports message authentication, which prevents
active message attacks. SMB signing provides this authentication by placing
a digital security signature into each SMB, which is then verified by both
the client and the server.
<P>
In order to use SMB signing, you must either enable it or require it on
both the client and the server. If SMB signing is enabled on a server, then
clients that are also enabled for SMB signing will use the new protocol
during all subsequent sessions and clients that are not enabled for SMB
signing will use the older SMB protocol. If SMB signing is required on a
server, then a client will not be able to establish a session unless it is
enabled for SMB signing. SMB signing is disabled by default on a server
system when you install the Service Pack; it is enabled by default on a
workstation system when you apply the Service Pack. For information on how
to configure SMB signing, go to the Microsoft Knowledge Base at
<B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/kb/">http://www.microsoft.com/kb/</A></B> and search for the following article: <B><A href="../winnt/q161372.htm">Q161372</A></B>.
<P>
Note: SMB signing will not work with the direct host IPX protocol. This is
because the direct host IPX protocol modifies SMBs in a way that is
incompatible with signature-enabled SMBs. This incompatibility will be most
obvious when you have direct host IPX clients and you require SMB signing
on the server. Requiring SMB signatures on the server will cause the server
to not bind to the direct host IPX interface, which will then force all
connections to the server to be signed. If you disable the NWLink binding
on the server then you will be able to use SMB signing.
<P>
Also, SMB signing will impose a performance penalty on your system.
Although it doesn't consume any more network bandwidth, it does use more
CPU cycles on the client and server side.
<P>
For more information on SMB signing, see the Microsoft FTP site at
<B><A href="ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/developr/drg/cifs/sec.htm">ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/developr/drg/CIFS/sec.htm.</A></B> For general information
on the CIFS protocol, see the Microsoft Web site at
<B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/intdev/cifs/">http://www.microsoft.com/intdev/cifs/.</A></B>
<P>
Password Filtering
<P>
This Service Pack includes a password filter (Passfilt.dll) that allows
system administrators to increase password strength. This filter is copied
to %system root%\SYSTEM32 when the Service Pack is installed on the system.
The password filter should be copied to the primary domain controller for
the domain, and to any backup domain controllers in the event the server
role in the domain changes.
<P>
To use the password filter, the following registry entry must exist. If it
doesn't exist you must create it.
<P>
WARNING: Using the registry editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-
wide problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of the registry
editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.
<P>
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa
<P>
Value: Notification Packages
<P>
Type: REG_MULTI_SZ
<P>
Data: Passfilt.dll
<P>
Notification Packages contains a list of DLLs to be loaded and notified of
password changes and password change requests. You can audit the loading of
Notification Packages by setting the audit policy in User Manager. To do
this, start User Manager and then click Audit on the Policies menu. In the
Audit Policy dialog box click Audit These Events and then enable Restart,
Shutdown, and System by selecting the Success and/or Failure check boxes.
<P>
Passfilt.dll implements the following password policy:

<OL><P><LI>Passwords must be at least 6 characters long.

<P><LI>Passwords must contain characters from at least 3 of the following
   4 classes:
<P>
<PRE>    Class            Examples
    -----            --------

    English Upper Case Letters          A, B, C, ... Z
    English Lower Case Letters          a, b, c, ... z
    Westernized Arabic Numerals         0, 1, 2, ... 9
    Non-alphanumeric characters     .,;:*&amp;%!

</PRE><P><LI>Passwords may not contain your user name or any part of your full
   name.
<P>
</OL>Custom password filter DLLs can be written to implement different password
rules. For more information, see the Microsoft Knowledge Base article
<B><A href="../win32sdk/q151082.htm">Q151082</A></B> Password Change Filtering &amp; Notification in Windows NT. You can
access the Knowledge Base at <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/kb/">http://www.microsoft.com/kb/.</A></B>
<P>
Restricting Anonymous User Access
<P>
Windows NT has a feature where anonymous logon users can list domain user
names and enumerate share names. Some customers who want enhanced security
have requested the ability to optionally restrict this functionality.
Service Pack 3 provides a mechanism for administrators to restrict the
ability for anonymous logon users (also known as NULL session connections)
to list account names and enumerate share names.
<P>
In addition, Service Pack 3 has a feature that restricts anonymous logon
users from connecting to the registry remotely. After Service Pack 3 is
installed, anonymous users cannot connect to the registry and cannot read
or write any registry data. Also, a new built-in group known as
Authenticated Users is created when you install Service Pack 3. The
Authenticated Users group is similar to the Everyone group, except for one
important difference:
anonymous logon users (or NULL session connections) are never members
of the Authenticated Users group.
<P>
For more information on these new features, including information
on configuring the registry to restrict anonymous user access to
list domain user names and enumerate share names, go to the Microsoft
Knowledge Base at <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/kb/">http://www.microsoft.com/kb/</A></B> and search for the
following article: <B><A href="../winnt/q143474.htm">Q143474</A></B>.
<P>
Using a System Key to Strongly Encrypt Password Information
<P>
Service Pack 3 provides the capability to use strong encryption
techniques to increase protection of account password information
stored in the registry by the Security Account Manager (SAM).
Windows NT stores user account information, including a derivative
of the user account password, in a secure portion of the registry
protected by access control and an obfuscation function. The
account information in the registry is only accessible to members
of the administrators group. Windows NT, like other operating
systems, allows privileged users who are administrators access to
all resources in the system. For users who require enhanced
security, strong encryption of account password derivative
information provides an additional level of security to prevent
administrators from intentionally or unintentionally accessing
password derivatives using registry programming interfaces.
<P>
The strong encryption capability in Service Pack 3 is an optional
feature. Strong encryption protects private account information by
encrypting the password data using a 128-bit cryptographically
random key, known as a password encryption key. Administrators may
choose to implement strong encryption by defining a system key for
Windows NT. To do this, administrators can run a utility called
Syskey.exe. For more information on using Syskey.exe to configure
a system key, go to the Microsoft Knowledge Base at
<B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/kb/">http://www.microsoft.com/kb/</A></B> and search for the following article:
<B><A href="../winnt/q143475.htm">Q143475</A></B>.
<P>
Win32 APIs and SDK for Service Pack 3
<P>
Service Pack 3 includes several new APIs, including two Win32 APIs
pertaining to spin counts on critical sections
(InitializeCriticalSectionAndSpinCount() and
SetCriticalSectionSpinCount()). To develop applications that take
advantage of these new APIs, a Service Pack 3 SDK will be available
on the Microsoft Web site at:
<P>
<B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/msdn/sdk">http://www.microsoft.com/msdn/sdk</A></B>
<P>
<P><h3>1.2 Support for PowerPC Platform</h3>
 
Microsoft is in the process of phasing out all Windows NT-related
development for the PowerPC architecture. Because of this, there are
no PowerPC files included in Service Pack 3 for Windows NT 4.0.
Microsoft plans to continue providing technical support for customers
who use Windows NT 4.0 on the PowerPC architecture.
<P>
<P><h3>1.3 Downloading and Extracting the Service Pack</h3>
 
If you have downloaded this Service Pack from an FTP site or a Web
site, you should read the release notes completely before you
extract and install the Service Pack.
<P>
After downloading the Service Pack, you will have a compressed
executable file (for example, nt4sp3_i.exe) on your hard drive. To
extract this file and begin the installation process, type
nt4sp3_i.exe at the Command Prompt or double-click the file from
NT Explorer. You can also extract the file into the current
directory without launching the installation program by using
the Command Prompt switch /x (for example, at the Command Prompt,
type nt4sp3_i /x).
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>2.0 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR WINDOWS NT 4.0 SERVICE PACK 3</h3>
 
<P>
<P><h3>2.1 Before You Install the Service Pack</h3>
 
Close all active debugging sessions before installing this
Service Pack, otherwise the Update program will be unable to replace
system files that are in use. If a file is in use when you install
the Service Pack, a dialog box will appear in which you can choose to
cancel the installation or skip the file copy. We recommend you choose
to cancel the installation, and then run Update.exe again, being sure
to select the uninstall option. Close all active sessions on the
system, and then run Update.exe again to install the Service Pack.
<P>
Also, to maximize the ability to recover the system in the event of
installation failure, it is recommended that you do the following
before installing the Service Pack:

<OL><P><LI>Update the system Emergency Repair disk using the Rdisk.exe
   command with the /s option.
</OL>2. Perform a full backup of the system, including the system registry
<PRE>   files.
</PRE></OL>3. Disable any non-essential third-party drivers and/or services
<PRE>   (that is, drivers and services that are not required to boot
   the system).
</PRE>4. Contact the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) that provided
<PRE>   the driver or service for the updated versions of the file(s).

</PRE>If you have installed a pre-release version of Microsoft
Internet Explorer 4.0 prior to installing this Service Pack, you
must remove the pre-release version of Internet Explorer 4.0 from
your computer before you install the Service Pack. You may then
reinstall Internet Explorer after successfully completing the
Service Pack 3 installation. This will not be necessary with the
retail release of Internet Exporer 4.0. Upon retail release,
Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 will be made available to
customers on the Microsoft Web site.
<P>
Users of NEC Versa 6050 or 6200 Series notebook computers, that
shipped preinstalled with Windows NT version 4.0, should select
"Yes" when Service Pack 3 update.exe prompts you to replace the
hal.dll file.
<P>
If you are running SystemSoft's CardWizard for Windows NT (support
for PCMCIA) or PowerProfiler for Windows NT (support for Advanced
Power Management), you must complete critical pre-installation
procedures prior to installing this Service Pack.  Otherwise, your
computer may no longer boot after installation of Service Pack 3.
These procedures can be found in the product section at
<B><A href="http://www.systemsoft.com">http://www.systemsoft.com.</A></B>
<P>
Advanced Power Management is not supported by Windows NT version 4.0.
As a result, Microsoft recommends that you remove Advanced Power
Management features before installing this Service Pack.
<P>

</PRE></OL>6.  Follow the instructions that appear on the screen.
<P>
<PRE>    Note: To use the uninstall feature of this Service Pack,
    you must create an Uninstall directory during the initial
    installation. Also, if you are reapplying the Service
    Pack after installing new software or hardware, you must
    choose to create a new uninstall directory. To indicate
    this, you must click "Yes, I want to create an Uninstall
    directory" when you are prompted. For further information,
    see Section 2.3 and 3.2.

</PRE>To install the Service Pack from a network drive:

<OL><P><LI> At the Command Prompt, type the command to connect
<P><PRE>    to the network drive which has the Service Pack
    files.
</OL></PRE>2.  Change the drive letter to that network drive.

<P>
<PRE>    Note: We recommend that you choose to create an Uninstall
    directory the first time you install the Service Pack. Also,
    if you are reinstalling the Service Pack after installing new
    software or hardware, you must choose to create a new
    Uninstall directory. To indicate this, click "Yes, I want
    to create an Uninstall directory" when you are prompted.
    For further information, see Section 2.3 and 3.2.

</PRE><h3>2.3  Service Pack Uninstall</h3>
 
This Service Pack contains an uninstall feature that you can use to
restore your system to its previous bootable state.
<P>
To enable the uninstall option, you must create an Uninstall
directory the first time you run Update.exe. To do this, when
prompted, click "Yes, I want to create an Uninstall directory." A
subdirectory in your Windows NT directory will be created. This
requires at least 60 MB of free space on the drive on which Windows
NT is installed.
<P>
To return your system to a previous bootable state, run Update.exe
and click "Uninstall a previously installed Service Pack." After
your system has restarted, the Update.exe program will replace the
files updated by the Service Pack with the files from the previous
installation and will return your registry settings to what they were
before Service Pack 3 was installed.
<P>
Note: If you install any applications that require Service Pack 3
or have bug fixes contained in Service Pack 3, performing an uninstall
could adversely affect those applications.
<P>
Note: If you plan to install an older service pack after uninstalling
Service Pack 3, take note of the following important precaution.
Service Pack 3 modifies the Security Account Manager (SAM) database
such that older versions of the SAMSRV.DLL and WINLOGON.EXE files no
longer recognize the database structure.  Therefore, the uninstall
process does not restore these files when uninstalling Service Pack 3.
If you install a prior service pack (e.g., Service Pack 2) after
uninstalling Service Pack 3, click "No" on the "Confirm File Replace"
dialog boxes that ask if you wish to overwrite SAMSRV.DLL and
WINLOGON.EXE.  If you overwrite the newer files with their older
versions, you will be unable to logon to the system.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>3.0  USER NOTES</h3>
 
<P>
<P><h3>3.1 Emergency Repair Disk</h3>
 
If you use the Windows NT Emergency Repair Disk to repair your
Windows NT system at some time after you install the
Service Pack, you will need to reinstall the Service Pack after the
repair is completed. This is because the Emergency Repair Disk
repairs your system by restoring your original Windows NT 4.0 setup.
After the repair has completed, simply follow the Installation
Instructions (section 2.0) to reinstall the Service Pack. For more
information on using the Windows NT Emergency Repair Disk utility,
go to the Microsoft Knowledge Base at <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/kb/">http://www.microsoft.com/kb/</A></B>
and search for the following article: <B><A href="../winnt/q146887.htm">Q146887</A></B>.
<P>
Note: To use the Emergency Repair Disk utility, you must have the
updated version of Setupdd.sys. The updated version is contained in
Service Pack 3. To update your version of Setupdd.sys, copy Setupdd.sys
from the Service Pack to your setup boot disk #2. This will
replace the older version of Setupdd.sys with the updated version.
For more information, go to the Microsoft Knowledge Base at
<B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/kb/">http://www.microsoft.com/kb/</A></B> and search for the following article:
<B><A href="../winnt/q158423.htm">Q158423</A></B>.
<P>
<P><h3>3.2 Adding New Components to the System</h3>
 
If you change or add new software or hardware components to your
system after you have installed the Service Pack, you need to install
the Service Pack again. This is because the files taken from the
original Windows NT 4.0 disk set may not be the same as the files on
the Service Pack disk set. You cannot install new components directly
from the Service Pack media (such as a new keyboard or printer
driver). You must install new components from the original product
media and then reinstall the Service Pack.
<P>
For example, if you install the SNMP service after installing Service
Pack 3, you will need to reinstall the Service Pack. If you fail to do
so, you will receive the error "Entrypoint SnmpSvcGetEnterpriseOID
could not be located in snmpapi.dll." This is because some of the
files in the SNMP service have been updated in the Service Pack and
you have a version mismatch. Reinstalling the Service Pack fixes the
problem by copying the newer versions of the files to your system.
<P>
Note: If you are reinstalling the Service Pack after
installing new software or hardware, you must choose to create a
new uninstall directory. To indicate this, click "Yes,
I want to create an Uninstall directory" when you are prompted.
<P>
<P><h3>3.3 Installing Symbol Files from the Compact Disc</h3>
 
Each program file in Windows NT has a corresponding symbol file that
is used to find the cause of kernel STOP errors. To install the
symbol files corresponding to the new binaries in Service Pack 3, do
the following (assuming your CD-ROM drive is D:, your symbol files
are located in the C:\WINNT\SYMBOLS directory, and you are installing
the files for an x86 machine):
<P>
XCOPY /S /U /D D:\SUPPORT\DEBUG\I386\SYMBOLS
C:\WINNT\SYMBOLS
<P>
This will copy the Service Pack 3 .dbg files over the existing
versions of these files. The XCOPY command shown will copy only those
.dbg files that are already installed (/U switch), and only those
with a more recent time-date stamp (/D switch).
<P>
For more information about debugging on Windows NT, see Chapter 39,
"Windows NT Debugger," in the Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Workstation
Resource Kit.
<P>
<P><h3>3.4 Remote Access Service PPP CHAP MD5 Authenticator Support</h3>
 
Service Pack 3 provides limited PPP MD5-CHAP authenticator support to
the Remote Access Server, which may be useful for small user-count
environments using non-Microsoft PPP dial-in clients. The support is
local to a given RAS server. The MD5 account information is stored in
the RAS server registry and is not integrated or synchronized with
the User Manager account database. Integrated support will appear in
a later release, at which time this limited support may be removed.
<P>
The local MD5-CHAP authenticator is enabled by creating the MD5 key
below and adding "account" subkeys of the form [&lt;domain&gt;:]&lt;user&gt;,
with subvalue "Pw" containing the account password. The ":" notation
is used instead of "\" due to the syntax rules of registry keys. The
<PRE>'domain:' is optional and typically omitted. MD5-CHAP will not be
</PRE>negotiated (old behavior) when the MD5 key does not exist (default).
<P>
HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\RasMan\PPP\CHAP\MD5
[&lt;domain&gt;:]&lt;user&gt;(REG_SZ)Pw
<P>
<P><h3>3.5  Microsoft DHCP Server</h3>
 
This version of the Microsoft DHCP Server modifies the format of the
DHCP database. You should back up the contents of your
%windir%\system32\dhcp directory prior to upgrading.
<P>
The address conflict detection feature can limit the throughput of
Microsoft DHCP Server. For improved performance, reduce the number of
ping retries in the Server Properties dialog box. This feature is
disabled by default.
<P>
Address conflicts are indicated by the replacement of the machine
name with "BAD_ADDRESS."  If a Unique Identifier is specified for
the address in the Client Properties dialog box, then the address was
declined by the client. If the Unique Identifier is not specified,
then the address conflict was detected by the DHCP Server.
<P>
Microsoft DHCP Server can be configured to set a client's default
gateway equal to its IP address. This causes the client to use the
Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) for all IP addresses on the local
subnet and is useful for routerless networks. To enable this feature
for all clients in a scope, add the following value to the registry:
<P>
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\DHCPServer
\Subnets\a.b.c.d\SwitchedNetworkFlag=1 (REG_DWORD)
<P>
This version of Microsoft DHCP Server supports BOOTP clients. BOOTP
addresses currently must be reserved in advance by creating an IP
address reservation. Future versions of Microsoft DHCP Server will
be capable of leasing dynamic addresses to BOOTP clients.
<P>
BOOTP clients that do not specify the parameter request list option
( 55 ) can still retrieve the following options from this release of
Microsoft DHCP Server:
<P>
1  Subnet Mask
3  Router
5  Name Server
12 Host Name
15 Domain Name
44 NetBIOS over TCP/IP Name Server
45 NetBIOS over TCP/IP Datagram Distribution Server
46 NetBIOS over TCP/IP Node Type
47 NetBIOS over TCP/IP Scope
48 X Window System Font Server
49 X Window System Display Manager
69 SMTP Server
70 POP3 Server
9  LPR Server
17 Root Path
42 NTP Servers
4  Time Server
<P>
In order to obtain other options, the client must specify option 55
in the BOOTP request. DHCP Server will return the options in the
order listed above. DHCP Server will return as many options as will
fit in response packet.
<P>
The activity log feature creates a text log file of all DHCP Server
activity. The file is located at:
<P>
%windir%\system32\dhcp\dhcpsrv.log
<P>
When the activity log feature is enabled this file will be kept open
by DHCP Server while the Server is running. To delete the activity
log file you must first stop DHCP Server, using the command:
<P>
NET STOP DHCPSERVER
<P>
If available disk space becomes low, the activity log will pause
until sufficient disk space becomes available.
<P>
You must also stop and restart the DHCP Service after enabling or
disabling Logging, Superscope, or DHCP Decline support.
<P>
<P><h3>3.6 Unencrypted Passwords No Longer Sent by Default</h3>
 
Connecting to SMB servers (such as Samba and LAN Manager for UNIX)
with an unencrypted (plain text) password fails after upgrading to
Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3. This is because the SMB redirector
in Service Pack 3 handles unencrypted passwords differently than
previous versions of Windows NT. Beginning with Service Pack 3, the
SMB redirector will not send an unencrypted password unless you add
a registry entry to enable unencrypted passwords. For information
on how to modify the registry, search the Microsoft Knowledge Base
at <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/kb/">http://www.microsoft.com/kb/</A></B> for the following article: <B><A href="../winnt/q166730.htm">Q166730</A></B>.
This article also contains information on how to change the
Service Pack setup process so that unencrypted passwords are
enabled after the Service Pack is installed.

<P>
<P>
<P><h3>5.0  ADDITIONAL FIXES AND WORK-AROUNDS</h3>
 
<P>
<P><h3>5.1 Tape Drive Not Recognized by Windows NT</h3>
 
In some instances, after you apply the Service Pack, Windows NT will
not be able to load the drivers for a tape drive, which may cause the
tape drive to shut down or be inoperable. This is due to a conflict
between the ATAPI driver that controls IDE devices and the tape drive
controller. To fix the problem, you must set your tape drive
controller to a different I/O address.
<P>
In most circumstances, your tape drive controller will be set to use
an I/O address in the range 0x3F0-0x3F8. The ATAPI driver uses I/O
address 0x3F6. If your tape drive controller has been assigned to
0x3F6, then you must assign the tape drive controller to an
available address.
<P>
<P><h3>5.2 File Sharing Problems with Windows 95</h3>
 
In some instances, you may experience "out of memory" problems when
you save a file to a shared folder on a Windows 95 machine. You can
obtain a fix for this problem at the following Microsoft Web site:
<P>
<B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/visualc/download/mfc42cab.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/visualc/download/mfc42cab.htm</A></B>
<P>
<P><h3>5.3 Reinstalling Hilgraeve HyperTerminal Private Edition</h3>
 
Service Pack 3 contains updates to the HyperTerminal product that
shipped with Windows NT 4.0. If you have installed the Private Edition
of HyperTerminal from Hilgraeve, Inc., then you need to reinstall the
Private Edition after applying Service Pack 3. For more information
on installing the Private Edition, go to the Microsoft Knowledge
Base at <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/kb/">http://www.microsoft.com/kb/</A></B> and search for the following
article: <B><A href="../winnt/q162469.htm">Q162469</A></B>.
<P>
<P><h3>5.4 Restoring Active Files and the Registry from Tape</h3>
 
Prior to Service Pack 3, the tape backup utility that shipped with
Windows NT 4.0 would not restore active files if the registry was also
restored. If you want to restore both the registry and active files,
then you must use the version of ntbackup.exe that is included in
Service Pack 3 (or newer).
<P>
To restore the registry and active files from a tape backup:

<OL><P><LI>Install Windows NT 4.0 from the release CD or from your network.
</OL>2. Replace the old version of ntbackup.exe with the newer version on
<PRE>   the Service Pack CD.
</PRE></OL>3. Run ntbackup.exe and restore the registry and system files from
<PRE>   tape.
</PRE>4. Reboot the system when restore is complete.
<P>
<P><h3>5.5 LPR Printing</h3>
 
LPR printer ports are by default now limited to using 11 TCP/IP
ports (721-731) to be RFC compliant. You can change this to have LPR
use any TCP/IP ports greater than 1024 by changing a registry
setting. For information on configuring the registry for LPR printing,
search the Microsoft Knowledge Base at <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/kb/">http://www.microsoft.com/kb/</A></B>
for the following article: <B><A href="../winnt/q141708.htm">Q141708</A></B>.
<P>
<P><h3>5.6 Updating Audio Drivers</h3>
 
If you are not receiving audio from a Crystal Semiconductor audio
chip or a Creative Labs Sound Blaster AWE32 PnP Wavetable Synthesizer,
you might have to install the updated drivers for these devices. For
detailed information on updating these drivers, go to the Microsoft
Knowledge Base at <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/kb/">http://www.microsoft.com/kb/</A></B> and search for the
following article: <B><A href="../winnt/q143155.htm">Q143155</A></B>.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>6.0  DEPLOYMENT NOTE</h3>
 
System administrators and others who anticipate corporate-wide
deployment of this product should consult Faq.txt for specific
cautions regarding the nature of this high-encryption product.
<P>
If you plan to install this product on a computer and travel out of
the country with that computer, please consult Faq.txt for cautions
and requirements regarding the nature of this high-encryption product.
<P>
<P><h3>7.0  EXPORT RESTRICTIONS</h3>
 
The North American (128-bit) version of Service Pack 3 is intended
for distribution only in the United States and Canada.  Effective
January 1, 1997, export of this Service Pack from the United States
is regulated under "EI controls" of the Export Administration
Regulations (EAR, 15 CFR 730-744) of the U.S. Commerce Department,
Bureau of Export Administration (BXA). EI controls are the current
equivalent of ITAR munitions export controls that previously applied
to this product. EI controls require that you obtain a Commerce
export license prior to any export, transmission or shipment of this
product to any country, other than Canada, or to any person, entity,
or end user subject to U.S. export restrictions. For further
information, the Commerce export license process and EI controls are
described on the BXA Web site at <B><A href="http://www.bxa.doc.gov/encstart.htm">http://www.bxa.doc.gov/encstart.htm.</A></B>
<P>
Microsoft will distribute the North American (128-bit) version of
Service Pack 3 to U.S. or Canadian companies or persons for end-use
in the U.S. or Canada only.
<P>
<P><h3>8.0  STRONG ENCRYPTION SUPPORT IN THIS SERVICE PACK</h3>
 
Available through Windows NT 4.0, CryptoAPI provides developers with
access to standards-based, core cryptographic functionality. An
Enhanced Cryptographic Service Provider is included in this Service
Pack, allowing applications that call CryptoAPI to use stronger keys
and new algorithms. Algorithm support has been extended to include DES
and Triple DES. Keylengths have been extended for RC2 and RC4 ciphers
to 128-bits; RSA keylengths have been lengthened to allow up to
16K-bit keys. For more detailed information, see Provider.doc on
the compact disc.
<P>
This Service Pack also includes 128-bit support for Remote Access
Server (RAS). Wide area connections made using RAS on both Windows
NT Workstation and Windows NT Server will use a 128-bit key to
encrypt data, thus providing a more secure connection.
<P>
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is used today by Internet browsers and
servers (including Microsoft Internet Explorer and Microsoft Internet
Information Server) for message integrity and confidentiality of
communications, and for optionally mutual authentication. With SSL,
parties using the Internet can be confident that their communications
are private and have not been tampered with or altered. The version
of SSL shipped with this Service Pack uses 128-bit encryption.
<P>
Secure Remote Procedure Call (RPC) has also been enhanced to support
128-bit encryption. Any application that requests secure RPC will
automatically use 128-bit encryption.
<P>
Installing Service Pack 3 will update your system with all of the
strong encryption support described in this section.
