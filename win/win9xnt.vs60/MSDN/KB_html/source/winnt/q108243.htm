The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The Digiboard intelligent serial port models 16EM and C\CON16 do not hang
up after using the NET2COM modem sharing utility under Windows NT.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The NetBIOS modem sharing utility, NET2COM which is shipped with the
Windows NT resource kit does not hang up and release the modem properly
when they are connected to models 16EM and C\CON16 intelligent serial port
system from Digiboard. Because the NET2COM utility uses WINVTP and NETBIOS
commands to send the AT strings to and from the modem, the Digiboard does
not handle the hang up and modem reset string properly. Therefore, never
reset the modem after you hang up.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To use the modem again, the modem must be manually reset or turned off and
then turned back on again.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>

<P><LI>Select File from the WinVTP menu and hang up from the shared modem.

<P><LI>Try reconnecting back to the modem.
