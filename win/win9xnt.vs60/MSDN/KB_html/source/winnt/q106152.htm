<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you change the default object account (system account) for the
Schedule service to another account, you will experience problems when you
run scheduled commands.
<P>
If you want to schedule commands that need to access network resources,
such as back up a remote share, you need to change the Schedule service
logon account from system account to a network access-permitted account.
This is done using the Services option in Control Panel by defining the
Startup settings. This is necessary because the system account has only
guest privileges accessing remote shares.
<P>
After you start the Schedule service, and add a process to the service
using the AT command, the command starts at the specified time, but doesn't
perform any action and returns without errors.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Start the Scheduler Service with the default object account (System
Account) and create the following batch file to be scheduled:
<P>
<PRE>   REM Connect to server1\share1 using privileges of user1
   NET USE Z: \\SERVER1\SHARE1 /USER:DOMAIN1\USER1 PASSWORD

   REM Execute remote backup of device Z:
   NTBACKUP BACKUP Z:\ /D "MY BACKUP" /B /L C:\BACKUP.LOG

   REM Disconnect remote share
   NET USE Z: /D

   REM Continue the operation for any additional remote shares

</PRE>This batch file first assigns drive Z to remote SHARE1 on SERVER1, and then
backups the remote share via the NTBACKUP command. After the backup has
been completed, drive Z is unassigned and reconnected to additional
share(s). The NET USE command is executed with a special account which
needs full access to all files installed remotely.
