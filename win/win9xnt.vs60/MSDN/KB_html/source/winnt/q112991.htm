<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Windows NT allows you to create a pool of printing devices on a print
server and make them appear as one printing device. This type of setup
might be used in a high-volume environment where it is not practical to
have to wait long periods of time for an individual print job. Keep in mind
that under Windows NT, a printer is a software interface between an
application and a printing device, and the instrument that prints is
referred to as a printing device.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When a printer pool is created, multiple printing devices are connected to
a single print server and behave as a single printing device. When a
document is printed by a user, the first available printing device in the
printer pool prints the job. The printing devices in the pool should be
identical to ensure printing consistency.
<P>
To create a printer pool:

<OL><P><LI>From the Print Manager window, choose the Printers icon or the printer
   window for the printer you want to create a pool with.

<P><LI>From the Printer menu, choose Properties.

<P><LI>In the Printer Properties dialog box, choose the Details button.

<P><LI>In the Printer Details dialog box, select port names from the Print To
   Additional Ports dialog box that correspond to the ports where you have
   connected printers.
<P>
</OL>To add (or change) the port name:

<OL><P><LI>In the Printer Properties dialog box, select Network Printer in the
   Print To dialog box.

<P><LI>In the Print Destinations dialog box, select Local Port.

<P><LI>Type the name of the port you want to add in the Enter A Port Name
   dialog box (this can include redirected ports to shared printers), and
   then choose the OK button. (This is when the administrator should assign
   unique, descriptive names.)
<P>
</OL>After the printer pool is set up, it appears to the users as a single
printing device. The owner of the printer pool should specify unique port
names for each printing device because this is the only indicator to the
user which printing device a print job is being printed to.
<P>
A printer pool is most useful if all of the printing devices are in the
same geographic location. If the user has to wander around from location to
location to find a print job, a printer pool is probably not a good use of
available resources.
<P>
Because the user never knows which printing device in the pool will print a
particular job, it does not make sense to have different types or models of
printers pooled together. Even something as simple as a different default
print tray or less RAM in one printing device in the pool may have adverse
effects on a particular print job.
<P>
When you define a printer pool, it is best to define the fastest printing
device first because the print spooler checks the available sources in the
order they were created.
