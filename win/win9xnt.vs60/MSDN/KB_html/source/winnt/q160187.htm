IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The packet burst protocol is built on top of Internetwork Packet Exchange
(IPX) and can speed the transfer of multiple packet NetWare Core Protocol
(NCP) file reads and writes. Packet bursting speeds the transfer of NCP
data between a workstation and a NetWare server by eliminating the need to
sequence and acknowledge each packet. In other words, the server or
workstation can send a whole set (burst) of packets before requiring an
acknowledgment.
<P>
Although IPX does not require one-request, one-response type communication,
the normal NCP implementation usually does. Burst mode communicates using a
multipacket which includes the IPX headers for each packet, the burst
headers for each packet and the request or reply, with or without data.
<P>
The packets that make up the burst are called fragments. One burst can be
up to 64 KB in length. By allowing multiple packets to be acknowledged, the
burst protocol can reduce network traffic on most IPX networks.
<P>
Additionally, the packet burst protocol monitors dropped packets and
retransmits only the missing packets.

<P>
<P><h3>Packet Bursting in Windows NT</h3>
 
<P>
Windows NT 3.51 and Windows NT 4.0 have packet bursting enabled
automatically and will not need any additional configuring to use packet
bursting for Gateway Services for NetWare (GSNW) or Microsoft Client
Service for NetWare (CSNW) connectivity to a NetWare server.
<P>
To disable Packet bursting in Windows NT 3.51 or Windows NT 4.0 use
Registry Editor to do the following:
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of
Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys
And Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and
Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics
in Regedt32.exe. Not that you should back up the registry before you
edit it.

<OL><P><LI>Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe) and go to the following subkey:
<P>
<P><PRE>      \HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services
      \NWCWorkstation\Parmeters
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for
   readability.

<P><LI>From the Edit menu, click Add value and add a parameter value called
   MaxBurstSize with a type of REG_DWORD and set the value to 0 (zero).

<P><LI>Quit Registry Editor and restart your computer for the above settings
   to take effect.
