When a Windows NT workstation connects to a Windows NT server running
McAfee's Netshield for Windows NT, the following error occurs when you try
to execute applications off the server sharepoint:
<P>
<PRE>   Can't run 16-bit windows program
   Access to the specified device, path, or file is denied.

</PRE>After clicking OK on that error message, the Windows NT workstation appears
to freeze for up to 5 minutes. After that time, another error message
appears:
<P>
<PRE>   Insufficient memory to run this application.
   Please close one or more applications and try again.

</PRE>Any attempt to run the same application located on the Windows NT server
from the Windows NT workstation will produce the second error above.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>

following two workarounds can be used to pending a new release of McAfee's
