<P>
When a trust relationship is broken at one end, whether it is due to a
server going down or someone removing the relationship from User
Manager, it is not enough to add the trust relationship back into the
domain that the relationship was broken from. Administrators from the
domains involved must remove the trust relationship and recreate the
trusts again.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When a trust relationship is established between two domains, the
password used to create the relationship is immediately changed by the
operating system, even if there was no initial password. The
controllers and servers for both domains know the new password. The
new password is not visible to the users, however. This password
change happens regularly to provide extra security. Because of this,
once the trust relationship is broken, the only way to reestablish the
trust is to reset it completely on both ends, which serves to reset
the password.
<P>
One side effect of the automatic password change is that the
administrator of the trusting domain gets only one chance to create
the trust relationship once the administrator of the trusted domain
has set up the other end. If the password is typed incorrectly, it
will no longer be valid, as the system will have automatically changed
it. In this situation, the administrator of the trusted domain must
remove the trusting domain from his or her list of "domains permitted
to trust" and add it back in again, then the administrator on the
other end should try again to establish the relationship.
