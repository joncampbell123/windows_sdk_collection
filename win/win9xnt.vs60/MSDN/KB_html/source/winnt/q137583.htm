<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Windows 95 allows shared network installations. This requires
transitioning from a real mode to a protect mode redirector. You are
logged onto the network while Windows 95 is in real mode so that the bulk
of the Windows 95 can be loaded by the client. This is done without client
validation on the domain. Once in protect mode, you are presented with a
graphical dialog box and the standard Username, Password, and Domain name
fields are available.
<P>
If the Username and Password entered for both the real mode and protect
mode logon are not the same, you are not validated by the Windows NT
Domain Controller. On page 110 of the Windows 95 Resource Kit, and again
on page 140, it states that a "generic" logon can be used.  For Windows NT
Domain validation this is incorrect. The following error appears:
<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft Networking:

   The Domain password you supplied is not correct or access to you logon
   server has been denied.

</PRE>NOTE: This feature does work for shared network installations in a NetWare
environment.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Historically, Microsoft network redirectors have cached login passwords.
This functionality remains in Windows 95's real mode client. The session
that is established in real mode is maintained during the transition and
at that time, the Windows 95 Server Message Block (SMB) protect mode
redirector is inheriting the original real mode password and does not
accept the second password unless the second password is the same as the
first.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.5,
3.51, and 4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new
information in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
