<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article discusses how to restrict users from creating or deleting
resource shares under Windows NT and describes the procedures that can
be applied to Windows for Workgroups 3.1x systems.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Under Windows for Workgroups 3.1x, an administrator could set up a user's
File Manager or Print Manager to restrict that user from creating file or
print shares. The administrator did this by adding an entry to one of the
.ini files of Windows for Workgroups 3.1x. This method is not possible
under Windows NT, but there are other ways to prevent a user from creating
file and print shares.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>File and Print Sharing Restrictions Under Windows 3.1x:</h3>
 
<P>
Under Windows for Workgroups 3.1x, an administrator could restrict both
File Manager and Print Manager sharing for the users of a specific
workstation. The administrator did this by adding entries, respectively, to
the Winfile.ini or Win.ini files. This procedure is described in the
Knowledge Base article "Disabling Peer-To-Peer Network Functionality with
WFWG," <B><A href="../win3x/q95470.htm">Q95470</A></B>.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>File and Print Sharing Restrictions Under Windows NT:</h3>
 
<P>
The two values described for disabling file or print sharing in Windows for
Workgroups 3.1x do not have counterpart entries in the Windows NT Registry.
This does not mean that ordinary users can create file or print shares
under Windows NT; they cannot. Windows NT is controlled via user accounts,
only those accounts that are part of the Administrators, Server Operators
or Print Operators groups by default are allowed to create or delete
shares.
<P>
The sharing options for a basic user account will be disabled. The Share As
option will be available but when a user tries to select it, an "Access
Denied" message will be returned. In Print Manager, the user will not be
able to create a printer or share one, although the user will be able to
connect to a shared network printer.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Completely Disabling File and Print Sharing Under Windows NT:</h3>
 
<P>
To completely disallow any sharing of system File and Print resources,
it is possible to disable the Server service in Control Panel&gt;Services.
To do this, go into Control Panel&gt;Services, select the Server service,
click the Startup button, click Disabled and click OK. Then, with the
Server service still selected, click on the Stop button. This will stop
the Server service immediately, otherwise, on the next reboot of NT
the Server service will not start by default.
<P>

Windows NT's NTFS file system permissions and the use of attributes, please
