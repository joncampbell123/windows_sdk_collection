<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Account lockout is only supported in a domain consisting entirely of
Windows NT 3.5 servers or later. Account lockout is not supported by
downlevel servers such as Windows NT Advanced Server 3.1 and LAN Manager
2.x. If account lockout is used in a mixed environment, security problems
may occur.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Account lockout is available as a new feature in domains consisting of
Windows NT 3.5, 3.51 and 4.0 Servers configured as domain controllers
The Windows NT Server System Guide defines account lockout as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   The account lockout feature enables you to make Windows NT Server more
   secure from intruders who try to log on by guessing the passwords of
   existing user accounts. When account lockout is enabled, a user account
   becomes locked if there are a number of incorrect attempts to log on to
   that account within a specified amount of time. Locked accounts cannot
   log on. A locked account remains locked until an administrator unlocks
   it, or until a specified amount of time passes, depending on how you
   configure account lockout. By default, account lockout is disabled.

</PRE>If downlevel servers exist in the domain, account lockout cannot be
considered a dependable security feature. For example, a Windows NT
Advanced Server backup domain controller (BDC) may authenticate a user even
though the account is marked as locked out on the Windows NT 3.5X\4.0
domain controller. Also, Windows NT Advanced Server BDCs are not able to
participate in getting an account unlocked. The Windows NT Advanced Server
is able to increment the bad password count when the user logs in with an
incorrect password, and is able to report the increment to the Windows NT
3.5X/4.0 domain controller. However, the Windows NT Advanced Server BDC
does not inform the Windows NT 3.5X\4.0 domain controller if the user logs
on with the correct password. Consequently, the bad password count does not
get reset after the successful logon.
<P>
The account lockout feature of LAN Manager is not compatible with the
account lockout feature of Window NT 3.5X/4.0 Server. The Windows NT
3.5X\4.0 domain controller does not replicate any account lockout
information to a LAN Manager BDC. If the account is marked locked out on
the Windows NT 3.5X\4.0 domain controller, the LAN Manager BDC may still
validate the user. The LAN Manager BDC will show account lockout policy set
to Never, even in a Windows NT 3.5X\4.0 domain where account lockout has
been enabled.
