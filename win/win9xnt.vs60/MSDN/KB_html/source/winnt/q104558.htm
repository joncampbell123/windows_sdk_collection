The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server versions 3.1, 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
Changing computer names for Windows NT Advanced Server can only be
done after the computer is synchronized.
<P>
To change the name of a Controller or Server for Windows NT Advanced
Server, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Create a new Server Account with Server Manager on the Controller.

<P><LI>From the computer that needs the computer name changed, change the
   name to the new name.
<P>
   The administrator will receive a message warning "Changing the computer
   name without the domain administrator first changing its name on the
   domain will result in domain accounts not being able to access or log on
   to this computer. Are you sure?"
<P>
   Choose Yes (if the computer account has been created on the Controller).

<P><LI>Shut down and restart the Server with the name change.

<P><LI>When you log on, you will receive the message "At least one service or
   driver failed during system startup."
<P>
   The event log will show that netlogon failed because it "Failed to
   authenticate with the controller, a Windows NT Advanced Server for
   domain XXXX" Event ID = 3210. Data code C0000022
   Status_Access_Denied."
<P>
   The administrator should start the Server Manager on the computer on
   which the name was changed. The old computer name appears highlighted
   and the new name is still unavailable (grayed out). This is a browser
   problem and has nothing to do with netlogon failing to start on this
   computer.

<P><LI>Select the new computer name that is unavailable and select
   Synchronize With Domain Controller. At this point, it will start
   netlogon and synchronize the database with the Controller correctly
   and the computer name will now be highlighted in Server Manager.

<P><LI>Delete the old computer (machine) account.
<P></OL>
