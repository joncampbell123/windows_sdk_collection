<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
While using Remote Access Server (RAS) Administrator to remotely administer
a domain, you get the following error in RAS Administrator:
<P>
<PRE>   No Remote Access Servers were found in the selected domain.

</PRE>Or the following error may appear in your Windows NT graphical user
interface (GUI):
<P>
<PRE>   Error 1909: The referenced account is currently locked out and may
   not be logged on to.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
You have a one-way trust from your domain (domain A) to two other domains
(domains B and C). You have an account on domains B and C, but your
password is different on the two trusted domains.
<P>
You have administrator privilege on all domains, and you use RAS to
remotely administer one of the domains, say domain B. Then you shift the
RAS Administrator focus to domain C. Now one of the errors listed above
occurs. You should be offered the opportunity to supply the correct
password, but instead you get one of the previously mentioned error
messages.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51.
We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Which error message you get depends on whether you have the "Account
lockout" option selected in the Account Policy menu item for User Manager
for Domains:
<P>
Case 1: If "Account lockout" is configured, you will get the "No Remote
Access Servers were found..." error.
<P>
Case 2: If "Account lockout" is configured, you will get the Error 1909 in
the Windows NT user interface.
<P>
Notice that under these same conditions Event Viewer and Server Manager
produce the error "Access Denied" if Account lockout is not selected. With
the Account lockout option selected, all tools produce the Error 1909 in
the GUI.
