<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The following article discusses Microsoft BackOffice interoperability
with Microsoft Cluster Server (MSCS).
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft SQL Server:
<P>
Microsoft will support the Enterprise Edition of Microsoft SQL Server on
MSCS clusters. Microsoft SQL Server, Enterprise Edition version 6.5 will
provide "active/active" cluster support in the second half of 1997 (that
is, both servers can be running SQL Server, with each server, supporting
its own databases). Microsoft SQL Server 7.0, currently in beta test, will
include additional cluster-aware enhancements that provide for faster
recovery in the event of a server or application failure. The version of
Microsoft SQL Server that follows Release 7.0 will include new features
for shared-nothing scalability on MSCS clusters (that is, a single
database will be able to span multiple servers).
<P>
Microsoft Exchange Server:
<P>
Microsoft will support the Enterprise Edition of Microsoft Exchange Server
on MSCS clusters. The "Osmium" release of Exchange Server, Enterprise
Edition will provide "active/passive" failover on an MSCS cluster. This
means Exchange/E "Osmium" will be able to run on one server in the cluster
at a time, and MSCS will be able to automatically restart Exchange on the
other server following an application or server failure. Future versions
of
Exchange will be enhanced for active/active failover (that is, ability to
run Exchange simultaneously on both servers).
<P>
Microsoft SNA Server:
<P>
Microsoft SNA Server already provides a hot failover capability
independent of Microsoft Cluster Server; therefore, SNA would not benefit
from the failover functionality. However, it may be possible to install
SNA into a cluster. Because of the built-in failover capability within SNA
Server, this option is not recommended.
<P>
Microsoft Proxy Server:
<P>
The current version of Microsoft Proxy Server has its own capability for
chaining together multiple servers for high availability and scalability:
therefore, it would not benefit from Microsoft Cluster Server's failover
functionality.
<P>
Microsoft Systems Management Server:
<P>
Microsoft does not support the installation of the current version of
Microsoft Systems Management Server with Microsoft Cluster Server.
Microsoft intends to provide cluster-enabled high availability for Systems
Management Server in a future release.
<P>

Cluster Server, please reference the following URL:
