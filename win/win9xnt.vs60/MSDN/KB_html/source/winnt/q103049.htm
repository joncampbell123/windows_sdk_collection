<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Operating System version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how to remove Windows NT from your computer.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Before you begin, make sure you know where Windows NT is installed,
how much of it you want to remove, and how your hard disk is partitioned
and formatted. Then, go to one of the following sections:

<UL><LI>Removing Windows NT from the Boot Sequence
<LI>Removing a Primary NTFS Partition
<LI>Removing Windows NT Files
<P>
</UL><h3>Removing Windows NT from the Boot Sequence</h3>
 
<P>
There are two ways to remove the Windows NT boot sector from your
computer:

<UL><LI>If you want to return to your original MS-DOS configuration, boot
   MS-DOS and type "sys c:" (without the quotation marks). This
   command replaces the Windows NT boot sector with the MS-DOS boot
   sector, and allows your computer to boot MS-DOS. The following
   files are left in the root folder and can be deleted after
   you perform the "sys c:" operation:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Pagefile.sys
      Boot.ini
      Ntldr
      Ntdetect.com
      Ntbootdd.sys
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: The Ntbootdd.sys file is installed only if you have a SCSI Host
   Adapter installed in Windows NT.
<P>
   You can also start your computer with a Windows 95 bootable floppy disk
   and use the "sys c:" command if you want to return to your original
   Windows 95 configuration.

<LI>If you want to leave Ntldr on the disk, you can boot MS-DOS without
   being prompted by changing the startup operating system and time-out
   value. To do so, start the System tool in Control Panel, click the
   Startup/Shutdown tab, click MS-DOS in the Startup box, and type "0"
   (without quotation marks) in the Show List For &lt;n&gt; Seconds box.
<P>
</UL>NOTE: If the primary partition was converted to NTFS, the only way to
return to starting MS-DOS automatically is to reformat the drive and
reinstall MS-DOS. See the next section if this is the case.
<P>
<P><h3>Removing a Primary NTFS Partition</h3>
 
<P>
In general, attempts to modify the primary, bootable NTFS partition
do not succeed for the following reasons:

<UL><LI>MS-DOS versions 5.0 and 6.0 do not recognize an NTFS partition. The
   MS-DOS Fdisk program reports an NTFS partition as an OS/2
   high-performance file system (HPFS) partition.

<LI>You cannot modify or delete an NTFS primary partition within
   the partition.
<P>
</UL>To delete or modify a primary NTFS partition, use any of the following
methods:

<UL><LI>Boot MS-DOS version 6.0 from a floppy disk and press RETURN to continue
   installing MS-DOS 6. When you are prompted to do so, choose "Remove
   files."

<LI>Initiate Windows NT installation from floppy disks or a CD-ROM. When
   you are prompted to do so, choose "P" to remove the partition.

<LI>Use the Delpart tool (Delpart.exe) to delete the NTFS partition. The
   Delpart tool is included with the Microsoft Windows NT 3.1 Resource Kit
   only. It is not included in the Windows NT 3.5, 3.51 or 4.0 Resource
   Kits. Note that the Delpart tool cannot delete a logical drive an
   extended partition.

<LI>Boot OS/2 version 1.x from a floppy disk and run its Fdisk program.
   To remove the partition, specify the /D option.
<P>
</UL><h3>Removing Windows NT Files</h3>
 
<P>
You can remove the following folders to remove Windows NT files and free
disk space:
<P>
Windows NT 3.51 and Earlier:

<UL><LI>Users
<LI>Win32app
<LI>Winnt
<P>
   NOTE: The Winnt folder name may vary. Windows NT may also be installed
   in the same folder as Windows 3.1. If this is the case, you should
   delete only the System32 folder in the Windows folder.)
<P>
</UL>Windows NT 4.0:

<UL><LI>Users
<LI>Winnt
<P>
   NOTE: The Winnt folder name may vary.
<P>
</UL>Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 95 both use the following folders. Delete them
only if you are not running or do not intend to keep the Windows 95
installation.

<UL><LI>Program Files
<LI>Recycled
<P></UL>
