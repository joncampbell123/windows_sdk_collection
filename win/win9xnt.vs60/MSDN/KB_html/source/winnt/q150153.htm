The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5 and 3.51
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5 and 3.51
<LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you use the account lockout feature in User Manager on your Windows NT
RAS server, you may eventually see the following error in the System Log of
the Event Viewer:
<P>
<PRE>   Event ID: 20077                       Source: Remote Access Service

   An error occurred in the Point to Point Protocol module on port COM&lt;x.
   The account is disabled.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This error results from an RAS client's exceeding the number of bad logon
attempts permitted by the setting in the Account Policy option of the User
Manager.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
By itself, the error message text for event 20077 does not provide the
information needed to identify the RAS client responsible for the error. To
track the source of the invalid logon attempts, you can enable the Auditing
for Logon Failure option. To do this, go into User Manager, open the
Policies menu, and use the Auditing option to enable Auditing for Logon
Failure." You should then be able to correlate the failed logon
error message with the RAS client that triggered the error.
<P>
Each Security Log logon failure entry will record the user name and time of
the failed logon attempt. This record will show the reason as "Unknown user
name or bad password." When the user exceeds the bad logon attempt limit,
the Security Log will record a logon failure and give the reason "Account
locked out." This last failure should correspond exactly in time to the
event 20077 in the System Log.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5 and
3.51. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When the limit of bad logon attempts is exceeded, on a Windows NT 3.5 or
3.51 RAS client, the following error will display on the screen:
<P>
<PRE>   Error 67: The account is disabled.

</PRE>When the bad logon limit is reached but not exceeded by a Windows 95
dial-up networking (DUN) client to an NT RAS server, the client may display
the following error:
<P>
<PRE>   The computer you have dialed into has denied access because your
   user name and/or your password is invalid on the domain.

</PRE>When a Windows 95 DUN client exceeds the logon limit, the following error
is displayed:
<P>
<PRE>   Your account is not active. Contact your network administrator.
