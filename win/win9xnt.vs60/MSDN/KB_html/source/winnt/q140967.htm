The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51 and 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51 and 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After you change a user's password in User Manager, logon attempts by this
user using the new password may fail with the following error dialog being
displayed:
<P>
<PRE>   The system could not log you on. Make sure your user name and domain
   are correct, then type your password again. Letters in passwords must
   be typed using the correct case. Make sure that Caps Lock is not
   accidentally on.

</PRE>If the old password is known, you can still log on using the old password.
<P>
This condition persists for a period of time, then corrects itself. After
a while, logon attempts succeed if the new password is used, and fail if
the old password is used, as expected.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This error occurs when the following conditions apply:

<UL><LI>"User Must Change Password At Next Logon" was checked when the password
   was changed in User Manager (this option becomes checked by default when
   changing the passwords of users who are not Administrators.)

<LI>The workstation authenticates with a Backup Domain Controller (rather
   than the Primary Domain Controller) before the new password has been
   replicated from the PDC to the authenticating BDC.
<P>
   In this situation the BDC does not recognize the new password and refers
   the logon request to the PDC. The PDC recognizes the new password, but
   returns a status of 0xC0000224 (STATUS_PASSWORD_MUST_CHANGE).
<P>
   This indicates a valid logon, but the BDC was incorrectly treating this
   as a failed logon and erroneously returning a status of 0xC000006A
   (STATUS_BAD_PASSWORD) back to the workstation.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
During startup, a workstation establishes a secure channel with a Domain
Controller for the purposes of logon validation. The secure channel may be
established with any Domain Controller (the PDC or any BDC.) Once the
secure channel is established with a domain controller, it stays connected
to the same domain controller until the workstation is shut down and
restarted. If there are many BDCs, the secure channel will most likely be
with a BDC rather than the PDC.
<P>
When a user's password is changed via User Manager, the password change is
recorded on the PDC only. The change is not replicated immediately to the
BDCs. The change is only replicated at the next scheduled replication time
or when an administrator manually requests synchronization of one or more
BDCs, or the entire domain, from User Manager.
<P>
Prior to replication, the BDC is unaware of the new password so if a logon
is attempted with the new password the BDC treats it as a bad password. The
BDC does not reject the bad password immediately. Instead it passes the
logon request to the PDC, on the assumption that the password is a new
password known to the PDC but not yet been replicated to the BDC.
<P>
When "User Must Change Password At Next Logon" is in effect, the PDC
returns a status of 0xC0000224 (STATUS_PASSWORD_MUST_CHANGE) to the BDC.
This indicates a successful logon. However, in response to this status, the
BDC was erroneously returning a status of 0xC000006A (STATUS_BAD_PASSWORD)
back to the workstation.
<P>
If the logon with the new password succeeds and the logon with the old
password fails, this is most likely due to SAM database synchronization
occurring automatically while trying to reproduce the problem. Check the
System event log on the BDC for recent NETLOGON events number 5715. This
indicates successful partial synchronization of the SAM database, including
the new password, which masks the problem. If this is the case, run the
sequence again before the next automatic synchronization occurs.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Use one of the following to resolve this problem:

<UL><LI>Synchronize the entire domain using Server Manager.

<LI>Synchronize the appropriate BDC with the PDC using Server Manager.

<LI>Wait for the password change to be replicated automatically.

<LI>Apply the Hotfix described below to all Domain Controllers.
<P>
</UL>The Hotfix modifies the BDC's status handling code to pass a PDC status of
0xC0000224 (STATUS_PASSWORD_MUST_CHANGE) through to the workstation that
submitted the logon request. The workstation then recognizes a successful
logon and prompts the user to change their password.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0.
This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the following word
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):
<P>
<PRE>   S E R V P A C K

</PRE>Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. A
supported fix is now available, but is not fully regression-tested and
should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem.
Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix.
Contact Microsoft Product Support Services for more information.
