<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you install Windows NT Server or Workstation version 3.51 on ALR's
Evolution V ST or Evolution V Ste, the install might fail after NT setup
has rebooted the system to go into the graphical mode portion of setup. It
will fail after NTDETECT and OSLOADER load. The system will Blue Screen
with the following message:
<P>
<PRE>   STOP: 0x00000078 (0x00000000,0x00000000,0x00000000,0x00000000)
      PHASE0_EXCEPTION

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
ALR's Evolution V ST and Evolution V STe systems are multi-processor
compatible systems (Intel MP v1.1 specification). In cases where customers
have received this error, the system had a single processor, were supplied
with Phoenix BIOS 4.04.x, and could be ordered with Adaptec's 2940 SCSI
controller.
<P>
<P><h3>Troubleshooting Information:</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>STOP: 0x00000078 is typically an error related to either a RAM memory
   problem or a BIOS problem and these are the first items that need to be
   checked.
<P>
   A. Make sure that memory values, if configurable through CMOS or an
<P><PRE>      EISA Configuration utility, match the amount of memory that is
      physically installed in the computer, either in SIMM slots and/or
      memory that physically resides on the motherboard.
</PRE><P>
   B. If the amount of memory is configured properly, make sure at system
<P><PRE>      boot that the amount of memory the computer counts matches what is
      installed. If it does not match within at least 1 Mb, you might have
      a bad memory chip or one that was not be seated properly in the SIMM
      socket.
</PRE><P>
   C. If you've replaced or added memory chips, make sure that they are
<P><PRE>      seated properly.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Since these systems can have both Phoenix BIOS 4.04.x or greater and
   Adaptec 2940 with BIOS 1.16 or greater, you should obtain the most
   recent revisions for both the Phoenix and Adaptec 2940 BIOS.
<P>

   Microsoft Knowledge Base:

<PRE>   TITLE     : Adaptec AHA2940 Related Problems

</PRE><P><LI>If you followed steps 1 and 2 with no success, try reinstalling NT,
   either from the boot floppies or a floppy-less CD-ROM install.
<P>
   A. Press F5 during the portion of Windows NT 3.51 Setup that displays
<P><PRE>      the following text:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>        Setup is inspecting your computer's hardware

   B. Select "Standard PC" from the list of computer types. This forces
      Windows NT Setup to use the uni-processor Hardware Abstraction Layer
      (HAL).

   C. Continue with setup making any further configuration changes
      necessary (adding updated SCSI devices drivers or other mass storage
      drivers, and so forth).

   D. During the third system reboot that takes setup into graphical mode,
      the system should be able to successfully enter the graphical portion
      of setup without the STOP 0x00000078 and NT's final configuration
      settings can be completed.
