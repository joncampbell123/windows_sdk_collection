<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 and 3.51
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 and 3.51
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The Windows NT 3.5 and 3.51 FTP service can be configured for three
different download logging options using the following registry parameter:
<P>
<PRE>   LogFileAccess
   Value Type: REG_DWORD
   Default: 0 (don't log file accesses)
   Description: This value controls the logging of file accesses. This
                value can be one of the following:

                0 = Don't log file accesses
                1 = Log file accesses to FTPSVC.LOG
                2 = Log file accesses to FTyymmdd.LOG, where yy is the
                    year, mm is the month, and dd is the day. A new log
                    file will be opened every day as necessary.

</PRE>If option 2 is used, and the LogFileDirectory is on an NTFS partition
where not Everyone has full permissions, then the FTP server mail fail
to open a new logfile each day.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The FTP server creates a new thread for each user that logs in. The
thread impersonates the user account that is specified in the logon. This
may be "guest" or "anonymous", for example.
<P>
When the first file is retrieved or stored after the system date has
changed to a new date, the thread that is attempting to do the logging
is also used to open a new log file. If this thread is impersonating a
user who does not have adequate permissions to the LogFileDirectory, then
the file cannot be opened and the server will stop logging until it is
stopped and restarted.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version
3.5 and 3.51. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.  This article
does not apply to Windows NT 4.0
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
The best known workaround is to give everyone who will be using the FTP
service at least "add" permissions to the LogFileDirectory. The
LogFileDirectory is specified with the following registry entry:
<P>
<PRE>   LogFileDirectory
   Value Type: REG_SZ
   Default: %SystemRoot%\System32
   Description: This value specifies the target directory for log files.
   This value is only used if LogFileAccess is not 0.

</PRE>File Manager can be used to set permissions on this directory.
