<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Creative Labs manufactures the Sound Blaster 16 SCSI-2 audio card. This
card works properly as a SCSI adapter under Windows NT using drivers
included in Windows NT. The audio portion of this card works when you use
drivers supplied by Creative Labs.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Sound Blaster 16 SCSI-2 card has an Adaptec AIC 6360 chip on board
which appears in the hardware compatibility list. If the card is in the
machine when you install Windows NT, it will be detected as an Adaptec
151x/152x/AIC 6260/6360 SCSI adapter. When you add the card after Windows
NT is installed, you need to manually install the driver by doing the
following steps:

<OL><P><LI>From Program Manager, start the Windows NT Setup program.

<P><LI>From the Options menu, choose Add/Remove SCSI Adapters.

<P><LI>In the SCSI Adapter Setup window, choose Add.

<P><LI>After you read the Setup Message, choose OK.

<P><LI>In the Adapter dialog box, select Adaptec 151x/152x/AIC 6260/6360.

<P><LI>In the SCSI Adapter Setup dialog box, choose Close.

<P><LI>Quit the Windows NT Setup program.

<P><LI>Shut down and restart Windows NT.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: This adapter has to be set to IRQ 11 to work with Sparrow.sys.
<P>
The audio features of this card are not compatible with the Sound Blaster
1.x driver that ships with Windows NT. To get audio functionality from this
card under Windows NT, you need to obtain the appropriate driver from
Creative Labs. Currently the driver (SB_NT.EXE) is available on Creative
Labs’ BBS at (405) 742-6660 or in the BLASTER forum on CompuServe.
<P>
NOTE: Though this card will support SCSI hard drives, it will not support
booting from a hard drive connected to it.
<P>
For more information about these drivers or the card in general, call
Creative Labs Technical Support at (405) 742-6622.
<P>
The product included here is manufactured by Creative Labs, a vendor
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise,
regarding this product's performance or reliability.
