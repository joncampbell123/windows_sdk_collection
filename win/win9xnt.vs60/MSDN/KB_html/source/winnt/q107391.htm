<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you use NTBACKUP to restore to a network drive, the user making the
network connection must have write privileges to the share, regardless of
the directory or file permissions or other rights granted to the user.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you share a network drive, you have the option of granting or denying
users permissions on the share itself. These permissions should not be
confused with permissions that may be set on files and directories in an
NTFS partition. Share permissions are set in the Shared Directory dialog
box by selecting the Permissions button. Users can be granted the following
permissions to a share: full control, change, read, and no access. Because
these permissions are selected before permissions set on files and
directories are selected, they will override file and directory
permissions. Share level permissions will also override any rights that
would usually allow the user to write to a drive, such as those owned by
backup operators.
<P>
As a result, a user must have been granted either change or full control
permissions to a network share or NTBACKUP will fail to restore files to
the share. Once a user has been given the necessary permissions on the
share, then whether or not they can restore files to the share will depend
on file and directory permissions (if it is NTFS) and if the user has the
Restore Files And Directories right.
