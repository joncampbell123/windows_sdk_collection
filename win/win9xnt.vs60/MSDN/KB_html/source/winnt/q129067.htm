The information in this article applies to:

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
CompuServe offers direct dialup PPP support for accessing the Internet.
CompuServe provides an Internet Dialer program that requires an updated 16-
bit WINSOCK.DLL file that does not function under Windows NT. However, it
is possible to use the Remote Access Service included with Windows NT to
connect to the CompuServe PPP server.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To connect to CompuServe PPP server using Windows NT 4.0:

<OL><P><LI>Install Remote Access Service (RAS) in the Windows NT Network Control
   Panel. Make sure that "Dial-out only" or "Dial-out and Receive calls" is
   selected for the RAS device, and TCP/IP is one of your installed
   protocols.

<P><LI>Open My Computer and select Dial-Up Networking.

<P><LI>Select New, and on the Basic page, enter the entry name, phone number,
   and modem.

<P><LI>On the Server page, clear the IPX/SPX Compatible and NetBEUI protocol
   check boxes, and make sure that TCP/IP is selected.

<P><LI>On the Script page, select Run this Script and select
   C:\&lt;systemroot&gt;\system32\ras\cis.scp.

<P><LI>Click OK to save the new entry.

<P><LI>The first time you dial, you will be prompted for a username, password,
   and domain.
<P>
<P><PRE>     - For username, enter your Compuserve user ID, which is normally
       something like 12345,6789.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>     - For password, enter your Compuserve logon password.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>     - Leave the domain field blank.
</PRE><P>
</OL>NOTE: Your TCP/IP settings should be automatically established when the
connection is made. You can view your current TCP/IP settings by using the
ipconfig /all command, after the connection is made.
<P>
To connect to CompuServe PPP server using Windows NT 3.5x:

<OL><P><LI>Install Remote Access Service (RAS) in Windows NT Network Control
   Panel. Make sure that "Dial-out only" or "Dial-out and Receive calls" is
   selected for the RAS device.

<P><LI>To make the PPP connection easier, add the following to the
   %SystemRoot%\System32\Ras\Switch.inf file:
<P>
<P><PRE>      [CIS-Internet]
      COMMAND=&lt;cr&gt;
      OK=&lt;match&gt;":"
      COMMAND=CIS&lt;cr&gt;
      OK=&lt;match&gt;":"
      COMMAND=userid/GO:PPPCONNECT&lt;cr&gt;
      OK=&lt;match&gt;":"
      COMMAND=password&lt;cr&gt;
      OK=&lt;ignore&gt;
</PRE><P>
   where userid and password equal your actual CompuServe user ID and
   password.
<P>
   NOTE: Anyone who has access to read your Switch.inf file can see your
   user ID and password. If you do not want to use Switch.inf, you can
   choose terminal instead of CIS-Internet in the Security dialog and enter
   the commands manually (click done after entering your password).
<P>
   If you perform this manual connection, the strings presented by
   CompuServe may be unreadable but everything will still work. CompuServe
   uses 7 data bits and even parity, and RAS uses 8 data bits and no
   parity. You can press the PLUS SIGH (+) and then ENTER to view the
   prompts using 8 data bits, but they may be garbled again after you enter
   your user ID. You may need to use GO TERMINAL to change your terminal
   settings on CompuServe. For more information contact CompuServe Customer
   Support.

<P><LI>From the Remote Access Service group, start Remote Access, or run
   RASPHONE.

<P><LI>Create a new RAS Phone Book entry.
<P>
   a. Click Add to create a new entry in the RAS Phone Book.
<P>
   b. Type Entry Name, Phone Number (same local dialup number normally
<P><PRE>      used to access CompuServe), and Description.
</PRE><P>
   c. Click Advanced if you are not already viewing the advanced options.

<P><LI>Configure your new Phone Book entry.
<P>
   a. Click Network.
<P>
   b. Select PPP and make sure the TCP/IP protocol is selected (you can
<P><PRE>      disable NetBEUI and IPX).
</PRE><P>
   c. Select TCP/IP Settings. Select "Server assigned IP address."
<P>
   d. Select "Use specific name server addresses" and enter 149.174.211.5
<P><PRE>      149.174.213.5 (backup) for the DNS server.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      NOTE: Use 149.174.64.42 as a backup DNS address. These DNS addresses
      may change. If you have problems with DNS resolution, you may need
      to call CompuServe for correct DNS addresses.
</PRE><P>
   e. Make sure you select the "Use default gateway on remote network"
<P><PRE>      check box.
</PRE><P>
   f. Accept these setting by clicking OK, and then click OK again.

<P><LI>Click Security. Change the After dialing Script to CIS-
   Internet if you modified the Switch.inf. Otherwise choose terminal.
<P>
</OL>You should now be able to connect to the CompuServe PPP dialup service and
use FTP, Telnet, WWW, and other TCP/IP services.
<P>
NOTE: In some cases, although you can connect to the CompuServe PPP dialup
service, you may have trouble connecting to Internet hosts. In this case,
