<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article is aimed at providing a way to join a domain from a command
line. This can be achieved with the NETDOM command line utility included in
Windows NT 4.0 Resource Kit Supplement 2.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
WARNING: The solution included in this article has not been extensively
tested in large installations. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
modifications of domains as recommended herein will accomplish the
objective described in this article under all circumstances and in all
configurations.
<P>
For the purpose of this article, assume MYDOMAIN is the name of the domain
and MYCOMPUTER is the name of the workstation or stand-alone server that is
joining the domain.
<P>
NETDOM lets you join a domain from the command line. This can apply to
Windows NT workstations and standalone servers.
<P>
<P><h3>If you are the administrator of the domain</h3>
 
<P>
If you have administrative access to the primary domain controller (PDC)
(such as through an user account member of the Local Administrators or
Domain Administrators groups,) NETDOM automatically creates the computer
account if necessary.
<P>
You may run the following command (in a single line):
<P>
<PRE>   NETDOM /Domain:MYDOMAIN /user:adminuser /password:apassword MEMBER
      MYCOMPUTER /JOINDOMAIN

</PRE>The command line above may be run on any computer as soon as you have
administrative access to the computer MYCOMPUTER. If you are already logged
on to the domain with an administrator account, then the options /DOMAIN,
/USER and /PASSWORD are not required.
<P>
<P><h3>If you are not an administrator of the domain</h3>
 
<P>
If you do not have administrative access to the PDC of the domain then you
must ask the administrator to add a computer account for your computer
member.
<P>
The computer account can be created as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   NETDOM /Domain:MYDOMAIN /user:adminuser /password:apassword MEMBER
      MYCOMPUTER /ADD

</PRE>Then act as follows to join the domain.
<P>
<PRE>   NETDOM /Domain:MYDOMAIN MEMBER MYCOMPUTER /JOINDOMAIN

</PRE>If the workstation or the stand-alone server was already in the domain the
secure channel is checked.
