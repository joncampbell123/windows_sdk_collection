The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you upgrade from Windows NT version 3.1 to Windows NT version 3.5,
some applications, such as Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel, may not be
able to view or print to newly created or connected printers if you have
stopped and then restarted the Spooler service. This problem only occurs
with the user account that was logged on when the Spooler service was
stopped and restarted.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem is caused by incorrect security permissions being written to a
section of the Registry from where some applications get printer data.
Because this section is set to Read Only, new printers are not written to
it and some applications will not be able to access the newly created
printers.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To correct this problem, change Administrators to Full Control in both the
Devices and PrinterPorts keys, using the Registry Editor as follows:
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
<PRE>   problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them.
   Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of
   Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

</PRE><P><LI>Start Registry Editor (REGEDT32.EXE).

<P><LI>From the HKEY_CURRENT_USER subtree, go to the following subkey:
<P>
<P><PRE>      \SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion
</PRE>
<P><LI>Select the Devices subkey and from the menu, select Security,
   Permissions.

<P><LI>Change Administrators to Full Control and choose OK.

<P><LI>Select the PrinterPorts subkey and from the menu, select Security,
   Permissions.

<P><LI>Change Administrators to Full Control and choose OK.

<P><LI>Exit Registry Editor.

<P><LI>Open the Properties Of A Created Printer dialog box in Print Manager,
   choose OK, and the Created printers will be rewritten to the Registry.
   Connected To Printers must be recreated.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: This problem will occur again if the Spooler service is stopped and
restarted. Use the above procedure if necessary.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5.
This problem was corrected in Windows NT Workstation or Server version
3.51.
