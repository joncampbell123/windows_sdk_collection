<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you copy a file from a Windows NT file system (NTFS) drive to a file
allocation table (FAT) drive, the time stamp changes to an even number of
seconds.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
File time stamps on FAT drives are rounded to the nearest two seconds (even
number) when the file is written to the drive. The file time stamps on NTFS
drives are rounded to the nearest 100 nanoseconds when the file is written
to the drive. Consequently, file time stamps on FAT drives always end with
an even number of seconds, while file time stamps on NTFS drives can end
with either even or odd number of seconds.
<P>
When files are copied from NTFS drives to FAT drives, some file time stamp
rounding has to occur; the file time stamp is rounded up to the next even
second. For example, if you copy a file with a time stamp of 13:34:23 from
an NTFS drive to FAT drive, the files is stored on the FAT drive with a
time stamp of 13:34:24.
<P>
To preserve exact NTFS file times, always copy files from NTFS drives to
other NTFS drives. If you are writing a program to compare file times
between NTFS and FAT drives, accommodate for the expected rounding.
