<PRE>  - Microsoft Windows NT operating system version 3.1
  - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If your computer has an ISA bus and more than 12 MB of system RAM installed
with the Graphics Ultra Pro or Plus, the Memory Aperture feature must be
disabled.
<P>
NOTE: Disabling the Memory Aperture feature can cause noticeable video
performance degradation.
<P>
You can disable the Memory Aperture feature with the ATI-supplied
INSTALL.EXE program. If you are unable to disable the Memory Aperture
feature, type "TEST.COM /i" (do not enter the quotation marks and make sure
the letter "i" is lowercase) to initialize the Graphics Ultra Pro or Plus.
Then run the ATI-supplied INSTALL.EXE program and disable the Memory
Aperture feature, save the settings, and reboot the system.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Memory Aperture feature on the Graphics Ultra Pro and Plus products
moves the video frame buffer into the motherboard system memory address
space to improve performance. While not required to access the color and
resolution capabilities of these graphics accelerator products, it does
improve performance.
<P>
386- and 486-based ISA systems use a 32-bit bus dedicated to system RAM in
order to address more than 16 MB of memory. Adapter cards, however, are
restricted to the addressing capabilities of the bus architecture. The 16-
bit ISA bus has a physical limitation that restricts its addressing
capabilities to a maximum of 16 MB of RAM.
<P>
The 2 MB Memory Aperture feature on the Graphics Ultra Pro and Plus must be
placed at a memory interval of at least 2 MB above the last address in
system memory. Therefore,
<P>
<PRE>   system memory (up to 12 MB) + system memory interval (2 MB) +
   Graphics Ultra Pro Memory Aperture (2 MB) = no more than 16 MB

</PRE>NOTE: The above restriction also applies to EISA-bus-based 386 and 486
systems with an ISA Graphics Ultra Pro or Plus installed. The EISA Graphics
Ultra Pro and Plus does not have this problem.
<P>
Graphics Ultra Pro and Plus are manufactured by ATI, a vendor independent
of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these
products' performance or reliability.
