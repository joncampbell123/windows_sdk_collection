WINDOWS
<P>
<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5 and 3.51
- Microsoft TCP/IP-32 for Windows for Workgroups, versions 3.11, 3.11a,
<PRE>   and 3.11b
</PRE>- Microsoft Windows 95
 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When logging on to the domain, a client will get one of the following error
messages:
<P>
If a Windows 95 client: "The domain password you supplied is not correct,
or access to the logon server has been denied."
<P>
A Windows for Workgroups 3.11 client: "The password you specified is
incorrect or your account is inactive.  See your network administrator for
the password or to activate your account."
<P>
A MAC client: "The password is not correct"
<P>
The logon is unsuccessful when logging on as a user; however, the
administrator successfully logs on from the same client.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This error occurs because the Everyone Group has been removed from "Access
this computer from network" user right from User Rights Policy in User
Manager on the primary domain controller (PDC). This built-in right is
required for Domain Users to log on to the domain.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To correct this problem,perform the folowing steps.

<OL><P><LI>Log on to the domain as administrator and start User Manager for
   Domains.

<P><LI>From the policies menu, choose User rights and select "Access this
   Computer From Network."

<P><LI>Click Add and select the Everyone Group.
<P>
</OL>Note: The Everyone Group is not required to access the domain. Specific
users and groups can be added to accomplish the same goal, but if any user
is not on the list they will not be able to log on to the domain.
