<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you install Lotus Improv version 2.0 in Windows NT, you may
receive an error message indicating that the permanent swap file was
not found or is not large enough. You may receive this error message
even if you have a sufficient paging file (PAGEFILE.SYS) in Windows
NT.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This error message may be caused by Improv not recognizing
PAGEFILE.SYS in Windows NT. It can also be caused by not having a swap
file at least twice the size of physical RAM in the computer.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
If you ignore the error message and continue with the installation,
Lotus Improv should install correctly.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you install Lotus Improv version 2.0, its Setup program checks
for a Windows 3.x permanent swap file. If it does not find a swap
file, or if it finds one that is less than twice the size of the
amount of physical RAM on the computer, you will receive a swap file
error message.
<P>
According to Lotus technical support, if you have 32 megabytes (MB) of
RAM, for example, the swap file would need to be 64 MB in order to
avoid this warning. However, a swap file (or paging file) of that size
is not necessary when running Lotus Improv. (According to Lotus, this
message is provided for users who run Improv on computers with less
RAM, such as 4 MB, 8 MB, and so on). In Windows NT, the paging file is
usually set to 12 MB plus the amount of physical RAM. Therefore, on a
32 MB computer, the paging file would be set up to be about 44 MB.
This of course, is not twice the amount of physical RAM, so Lotus
Improv's installation may generate the error message.
<P>

386-8600.
