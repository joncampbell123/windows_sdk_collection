The following information applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system, version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Windows NT networking environment defines groups to organize users
who have similar jobs or resource requirements into a unit, to ease
the process of granting appropriate rights and resource permissions.
When groups are defined, an administrator need only to take the one
action of giving a right or permission to a group to give that right
or permission to all the present and future members of that group.
Without this capability, it would be necessary for the administrator
to manually grant rights and resource permissions to each individual
user account.
<P>
To create or manage user and group accounts, use the User Manager. Use
File Manager to assign permissions for files and directories to users
or groups and use Print Manager to assign access to printers to users
or groups. Windows NT defines two types of groups: local and global
groups.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Windows NT workstations and Advanced Servers support local groups. The
table below presents the default local groups which represent the
different default privilege levels:
<P>
<PRE>   Windows NT                  Windows NT
   Advanced Server Domains     Workstations
   ---------------------------------------------------

   Administrators              Administrators
   Backup Operators            Backup Operators
   Server Operators            Power Users
   Account Operators           Users
   Print Operators             Guests
   Users                       Replicator
   Guests
   Replicator

</PRE>A second type of default group contains no members because the group
privileges apply to any account that uses the computer in a specified
manner. These groups do not refer to the privilege level of the user
but reflect resource access. The four groups are as follows:

<UL><LI>Interactive Users. Any user that only logs onto the computer
   interactively.

<LI>Network Users. Any user who connects to the computer through the
   network.

<LI>Everyone. Any user who accesses the computer. This group includes
   both interactive and network users.

<LI>Creator/Owner. Any user who creates or takes ownership of a
   resource.
<P>
</UL><h3>Local Groups</h3>
 
<P>
User Manager represents local groups with a graphic of two faces
imposed over a computer. A local group is local to the security system
in which it is created. A local group created on a Windows NT
workgroup workstation is available only on the workstation on which it
is created. A local group created on a Domain Controller is available 
on all Domain Controllers.
<P>
A local group on a Windows NT workstation can contain user accounts
created on the workstation, users and global groups from the
workstation's domain and users and groups from domains trusted by the
workstation's domain.
<P>
<P><h3>Global Groups</h3>
 
<P>
User manager represents global groups with a graphic of two faces
imposed over a globe. Global groups contain user accounts from one
domain grouped together as one group name. A global group cannot
contain another global group or a local group. The default global
groups on an Advanced Server are the Domain Admins and the Domain
Users groups. A Windows NT workstation does not define any default
global groups. However, because a global group can be a member of a
local group, a local group defined on a Windows NT workstation can
contain a global group from the domain. A local group can also contain
a global group from another domain by passing through trust
relationships. Local groups cannot traverse trust relationships.
<P>
The primary purpose of a global group is to support use on machines
other than the Advanced Servers in a domain. In a single domain model,
this applies to Windows NT domain workstations and LAN Manager servers
that participate in the domain.
<P>
<PRE>   NOTE: A local group and a global group that share the same name are
   two separate entities, each of which has its own distinct security
   identifier and characteristics as defined above. Permissions
   assigned to one group do not apply to the other group that shares
   the same name.
