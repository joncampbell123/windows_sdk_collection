<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
By default, desktop shortcut paths will point to the original application
location regardless of where a roaming user logs on.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
For example, a user installs Microsoft Word on his or her normal
workstation. If Microsoft Word is installed in the C:\WORD directory, a
shortcut created to Word.exe will use the path C:\WORD\WORD.EXE. When the
roaming user logs on at another workstation and loads his or her roaming
profile, the shortcut will appear, but the path will now be modified to
point back to the workstation on which the application was originally
installed. In some cases, the administrator may prefer that the path not be
linked to the original workstation. This can be accomplished through use of
a system policy.
<P>
By definition, a roaming user will log on to multiple computers. Roaming
profiles were created to allow this user to have the same desktop and
access to the same applications regardless of where the logs on to the
network. Typically, roaming users will access applications stored in a
central location, whether from a server share or from a share on their
normal workstation. Because this is the typical situation, the default
behavior for a desktop shortcut path is to point back to the original
application location. This allows the user to run exactly the same
applications regardless of the log on computer's location.
<P>
However, in an environment where every workstation is configured
identically, with the same applications and application locations,
administrators may prefer that shortcut paths point to the local drive, not
the remote, original location.
<P>
A System Policy entry was added to Windows NT Server 4.0 Service Pack 2
to allow shortcut paths to remain static and thus always use the same path.
If the original path for the shortcut was C:\WORD\WORD.EXE then that same
path to the local drive can be the same regardless of where the user logs
on.
<P>
To enable this feature, create a system policy using System Policy Editor
in Windows NT Server 4.0. To enable this entry, perform the following
steps:

<OL><P><LI>Copy Winnt.adm from the latest Windows NT Service Pack to the
   %SystemRoot%\Inf folder.

<P><LI>Start System Policy Editor (Poledit.exe).

<P><LI>On the Options menu, click Policy Template, and then click Add.

<P><LI>Click Winnt.adm in the %SystemRoot%\Inf folder, and then click Open.

<P><LI>Click Winnt.adm and then click OK.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Open Registry, and then double-click Local User.

<P><LI>Double-click Windows NT Shell, double-click Restrictions, and then click
   Disable Link File Tracking so that it is selected.

<P><LI>Click OK, and then on the File menu, click Save.

<P><LI>Exit System Policy Editor.
<P>
</OL>Note that this policy will not alter paths created before the policy was
implemented, so new paths may need to be established.
