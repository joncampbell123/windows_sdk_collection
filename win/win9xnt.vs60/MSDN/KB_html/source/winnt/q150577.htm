<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If multiple logical subnets are present on the same physical network (with
no routers between the subnets), communication between hosts from different
subnets might not be possible. The packets destined for nonlocal subnets
will be sent to the router (if configured for one) or dropped (if no
default gateway is present). The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is used
by the host to find the physical address (MAC address) of a target host.
An ARP request packet is broadcast on the local subnet if the target
host subnet address matches the host's subnet address.  If the subnet
addresses do not match, then ARP resolves the MAC addresses for the router.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following information is extracted from a Microsoft whitepaper on
TCP/IP.
<P>
When running multiple logical subnets on the same physical network, the
following command can be used to tell IP to treat all subnets as local and
to use ARP directly for the destination:
<P>
<PRE>   route add 0.0.0.0 MASK 0.0.0.0 &lt;my local ip address&gt;

</PRE>Thus, packets destined for "non-local" subnets will be transmitted directly
onto the local media instead of being sent to a router. In essence, the
local interface card can be designated as the default gateway.  This might
be useful where several class "C" networks are being used on one physical
network with no router to the outside world.
