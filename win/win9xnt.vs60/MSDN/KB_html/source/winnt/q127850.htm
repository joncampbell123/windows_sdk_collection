The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Windows NT Setup may not recognize your hard disks or your may stop
responding (hang) when booting if you use a DPT SmartRAID PCI (PM3224a/9x)
SCSI controller on an AST Manhattan P Series 5090 (single processor)
computer.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The DPT SmartRAID PCI (PM3224a/9x) SCSI controller is not on the Windows
NT version 3.5 hardware compatibility list (HCL), and it is not a supported
device.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Since the AST Manhattan P5090 is on the Windows NT 3.5 HCL, you may be able
to use the PM3224a controller if you configure it specifically for the
P5090. According to DPT technical support, you may need to perform some or
all of the following configuration steps for the system to successfully run
Windows NT 3.5:

<OL><P><LI>The DPT SmartRAID controller must be set as the boot device.
   If you set a disk connected to another controller as the boot
   device, then the system may hang at boot time.

<P><LI>Some models of the AST Manhattan P5090 have dual internal
   (embedded) NCR 53C810 SCSI controllers. One of them must be
   disabled for the DPT PM3224a to work.

<P><LI>You need to explicitly specify an Input/Output (I/O) address in
   the BIOS configuration program for the DPT PM3224a host adapter.
   However, you do not need to choose the default setting of 330H
   as the I/O address for the card. To set the I/O address for the
   card, press CTRL-D at boot time, and then choose HBIO from the menu.

<P><LI>In certain cases you may also need to disable PCI Parity in the
   DPT BIOS for the initial installation to succeed. Otherwise, memory
   parity problems may result.

<P><LI>Once the machine boots successfully, replace the DPT driver supplied
   on the Windows NT distribution disks with an updated driver from DPT.
   This updated driver is available from the DPT bulletin board system
   (BBS) at (407) 831-6432 (14000 to 2400 baud, HST/DUAL). The file name
   is NT351JJ.ZIP. Other DPT Bulletin Board numbers include: (407) 830-1070
   (14400 to 1200 buad, HST/DUAL), and (407) 830-0852 (9600-1200 baud).

<P><LI>As of 2/1/97, the latest firmware for the DPT SmartRaid PCI (PM3224a/9x)
   controller is FW290-007H1.  The latest ROM revision is SmartRom 3.DS.
<P>
