The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5 and 3.51
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5 and 3.51
</UL>

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When File Manager is used to copy files with long names to volumes that you
have Write-Only access to, the short (8.3) name will be used. The
write-only volume may be local or remote.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
File Manager attempts to determine whether the destination drive supports
long file names by using the GetVolumeInformation API to collect
information about the destination drive. This API call fails with an Access
Denied error when the destination drive is one for which you do not have
read access. Thus, the File Manager cannot confirm whether long file name
support is available. In this situation, File Manager chooses to use the
8.3 name for the file rather than attempt to copy the long file name to the
destination.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
If you have read/write access to the root of the volume, the
GetVolumeInformation call will succeed. In this case, no resolution is
required. Otherwise, use one of the following workarounds:

<UL><LI>If write-only access is required, assigning the write-only access to
   subdirectories of the shared root, where the root has read access, will
   permit files with long names to be copied to the subdirectories with
   names intact.
<P>
</UL>-OR-

<UL><LI>Alternatively, you can use the command-line COPY command. The COPY
   command does not attempt to verify whether long file name support is
   available before attempting to copy files, therefore it is not subject
   to this limitation.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51.
This problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
