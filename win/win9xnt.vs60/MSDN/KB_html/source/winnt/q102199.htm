<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If a Windows NT Advanced Server running Services for the Macintosh
requires that the Macintosh computers use the Microsoft User
Authentication Module (UAM), then the Microsoft UAM may need to be
protected from user activity, such as throwing the MS UAM away.
<P>
See below for procedures that you can use to protect the MS UAM.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To protect the MS UAM, do at least one of the following two
procedures. Note that both of these procedures are performed on the
Macintosh workstation, because that is where the MS UAM resides.
<P>
<P><h3>Procedure 1</h3>
 
<P>
Make the AppleShare folder in the Macintosh's System Folder
invisible. This keeps the Finder from displaying the folder, making it
unlikely to be erased on accident. Hiding the folder requires using
ResEdit or a similar utility.
<P>
<P><h3>Procedure 2</h3>
 
<P>
Lock the MS UAM file in the AppleShare folder. This helps to keep the
file from being thrown away by presenting the user with a warning
first. To lock the MS UAM:

<OL><P><LI>Go to the Finder and select the MS UAM file in the AppleShare
   Folder.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Get Info.

<P><LI>Select the Locked check box in the bottom of the Get Info window,
   and close the window.
<P>
</OL>The best protection for the MS UAM is to use both of the actions
described above. This hides the MS UAM and makes it more difficult to
throw away by accident.
<P>
NOTE: The actions in this article are designed to offer protection
from casual users. More experienced users will still be able to remove
the MS UAM if they want to.
