<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The current NetWare redirector shipped with the NCC (NetWare Compatible
Client) software for Windows NT does not allow you to access NetWare drives
by means of the AT Scheduler.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
After you connect to a NetWare drive using NCC software, you cannot use
that drive letter in batch scripts launched by the AT scheduler, although
batch scripts run correctly when you launch them manually. This is because
the NetWare redirector (NWRDR) distinguishes users by LUID (locally unique
identifier). The AT Scheduler service login session and the your login
session are deemed to be different sessions, so access to the NetWare drive
fails, regardless of which account starts the AT Scheduler service.
<P>
For portability reasons, you should avoid referencing drive letters in
batch scripts even if the redirector used supports it: if you do and the
current user logs out when the script runs, the job fails.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Rather than access NetWare drives within batch scripts that are run by
the Scheduler service, use UNC naming.
<P>
For example: To copy a file to a NetWare drive, use this string within the
batch file. NOTE: your account must have necessary rights on the NetWare
directory.
<P>
<PRE>   copy filename.ext \\nwserver\volume\subdirectory

</PRE>You may also be able to make the drive connection from within the batch
script, then delete the connection after performing the desired task. You
can add the /USER: parameter to specify a different account and password.
For more information on the NET USE command and its parameters type
<P>
<PRE>   NET USE /?

</PRE>at the command prompt.
<P>
<PRE>   net use X: \\nwserver\volume\subdirectory
   copy filename.txt X:        net use X: /del

</PRE>The following line fails when used within a batch script launched by the AT
Scheduler when the drive connection is made outside of the batch script.
<P>
<PRE>   copy filename.txt X:
