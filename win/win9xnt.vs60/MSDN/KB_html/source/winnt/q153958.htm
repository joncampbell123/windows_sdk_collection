The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0
</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Hewlett-Packard has introduced a new architecture targeted for the home
market called Print Performance Architecture (PPA). Conceptually, PPA
resembles other high-performance architectures such as Microsoft Windows
Printing System and Adobe Print Gear. These technologies offer high-speed
output by eliminating any intermediate print language and process pages in
the host format(in this case graphical device interface, or GDI) directly
into bitmaps for printing.
<P>
Because PPA is a departure from traditional printing architecture, Windows
NT is not able to support this device by means of its universal PCL driver
(RASDD).
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
PPA eliminates any intermediary page description protocol, namely printer
command language (PCL), between the host and the printer. As a result, two
process-intensive steps are eliminated:

<UL><LI>The conversion of the page description from the graphic
   environment's form (GDI for the Windows Environment) into PCL by the
   printer driver is eliminated.

<LI>In the printer, the conversion of the PCL description into a bitmap is
   eliminated. Instead, in the PPA architecture there is only one
   conversion from GDI straight to a bitmap.
<P>
</UL>To better understand the PPA architecture, it is necessary to review how a
PCL and PPA device prints.
<P>
<P><h3>PCL Printing Process</h3>
 
<P>
(Using a Deskjet device as an example)
<P>
Host:

<UL><LI>Application and OS System: User chooses to print. Application spools
   high-level GDI description of printed page to hard drive.

<LI>Rasterization and Bitmap Processing: Windows driver renders GDI objects
   and translates into four-plane color rasters and text.

<LI>PCL Encoding: Windows driver translates rasters and text into PCL.

<LI>I/O: Windows driver sends PCL to the Printer over the I/O channel.
<P>
</UL>Printer:

<UL><LI>I/O: PCL data arrives in I/O buffer.

<LI>PCL Decoding and Formatting: PCL data moved from I/O buffer into a
   format buffer. Text converted to rasters.

<LI>Swath Management: Formatted raster data is moved into a temporary
   buffer.

<LI>Swath Management: Rasters are converted into Printer sweeps formatted
   for Print Cartridges.

<LI>Mechanical and Print Head Control: Print sweeps are sent out to the
   print head and ink is fired, resulting in a printed page.
<P>
</UL><h3>PPA Printing Process</h3>
 
<P>
Host:

<UL><LI>Application and OS System: User chooses to print. Application spools
   high-level GDI description of printed page to hard drive.

<LI>Rasterization and Bitmap Processing: Windows driver renders GDI objects
   and translates it into four-plane color rasters and text.

<LI>Swath Management: Rasters are converted into Print sweeps formatted for
   the Print cartridge.

<LI>I/O: Windows Driver sends Demand Protocol Architecture (DPA) commands to
   the printer over the I/O channel.
<P>
</UL>Printer:

<UL><LI>I/O: DPA data arrives in I/O buffer using Direct Memory Access (DMA).

<LI>Mechanical and Print Head Control: Print sweeps are sent out to the
   print head and ink is fired using DMA.
<P>
</UL><h3>HP Print Devices That Support Only PPA</h3>
 
<P>
Currently, there are three models that support PPA only:
<P>
Hewlett-Packard Deskjet 820Cxi (Windows PPA)
Hewlett-Packard Deskjet 820Cse (Windows PPA)
Hewlett-Packard Deskjet 1000c (Windows PPA)
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Other HP PPA Printers</h3>
 
<P>
Hewlett-Packard Deskjet 720C
Hewlett-Packard Deskjet 722c
<P>
These printers support both PPA and PCL3 emulation. HP has provided a
monolithic driver with the printer. The driver can be obtained from
Hewlett-Packard's Web site.
