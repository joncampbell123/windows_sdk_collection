The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Microsoft Windows NT operating system version 3.1
- Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Whenever a new Windows NT Advanced Server is installed in a routed NetBIOS
domain environment, with the Advanced Server Primary Domain Controller
(PDC) located on another subnet you must follow the guidelines that follow
to ensure the new Domain Controller can properly validate itself onto the
Advanced Server PDC.
<P>
 
If a Windows NT Advanced Server PDC can't be located during the
installation procedure, complete reinstallation is needed, because the
Domain SIDs won't match
 
<P>

<OL><P><LI>LMHOSTS File Creation
<P>
   Create a "ready-to-run" LMHOSTS file containing at least the "NetBIOS
   name to IP Address" entry for the Windows NT Advanced Server PDC on a
   disk using the above mentioned predefined values.

<P><LI>Add Computer to Domain
<P>
   Define the workstation name for this new Advanced Server DC on the
   Advanced Server Primary Domain Controller by using the Control Panel
   Applet Server Manager in the Add Computer To Domain dialog box.

<P><LI>Start Installation of Windows NT Advanced Server
<P>
   Run the Advanced Server installation by using the network install
   procedure (WINNT.EXE) or the CD-ROM installation procedure with
   inserting the boot disk in drive A, until the network adapter
   configuration appears.

<P><LI>Add Adapter...
<P>
   During the initial installation of the new Advanced Server Domain
   Controller, the setup program scans for an available adapter. By
   default, the setup installs only the first adapter recognized. If
   multiple adapters have been installed, ensure the default adapter can be
   used to access the Advanced Server PDC. Otherwise, install any
   additional Adapter Card driver by using the Add Adapter button at this
   time.

<P><LI>Add Software...
<P>
   By default, only the NetBEUI protocol is installed; therefore, enter
   "Add Software ..." and select TCP/IP Protocol as the Network Software to
   install.

<P><LI>Configure...
<P>
   In the Installed Network Software dialog box, select the TCP/IP Protocol
   and use the Configure button to define the proper values for the IP
   Address(es), Subnet Mask and Default Gateway per adapter. Be sure you
   select the right adapter in the Adapter box to define those settings.
   Warning, only one adapter can support NetBIOS over TCP/IP. To eliminate
   any conflicts, install only the TCP/IP setting in this dialog box for
   the adapter needed to connect to the Advanced Server PDC.

<P><LI>Import LMHOSTS...
<P>
   Select the Import LMHOSTS option and import the "ready-to-run" LMHOSTS
   file created during the first step before you choose the OK button to
   continue the installation.

<P><LI>Return to Network Settings Dialog Box
<P>
   When you choose the OK button, you will be returned to the Network
   Setting dialog box

<P><LI>Leave Network Setting Pressing OK
<P>
   Be sure to have the above eight points checked before you choose OK in
   the Network Settings dialog box, because there is no way back from this
   point.

<P><LI>Define Computer Name and Domain
<P>
   Define the proper Computer Name added to the domain at point 2 and
   select the domain name into which this new Domain Controller will
   participate.

<P><LI>Validate onto Windows NT Advanced Server Primary Domain Controller
<P>
   If you continue from this point, the Advanced Server server will try to
   connect to the Advanced Server PDC to be validated, and synchronize the
   domain SIDs. If this fails into an error, check all network hardware
   including the routers and repeat to find the Advanced Server PDC. If at
   this point the connection fails, and you continue without connecting to
   the server, domain synchronization will fail and a full installation
   from point 3 is needed.
<P>
</OL>Additional information on how to create a LMHOSTS file is available in
chapter 19 of the Windows NT Resource Guide, Volume 1.
