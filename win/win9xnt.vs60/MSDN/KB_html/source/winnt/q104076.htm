<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you use Windows NT Setup to set up existing applications, icons
that are created from applications that are in directory names with
spaces will not work correctly.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>On an NTFS partition, create a directory with a spaces in its name,
   such as "dir name."

<P><LI>Copy a Windows 3.0 or 3.1 or Windows NT application into the
   directory (such as WRITE.EXE).

<P><LI>From the Main program group, open the Windows NT Setup program.

<P><LI>Select Options from the menu and then select Set Up Applications.

<P><LI>Select the drive on which the application is installed and choose
   Search Now.

<P><LI>After the drive has been searched, select the file that you copied
   to the NTFS partition and click the Continue button.
<P>
   Windows NT Setup creates an icon in the Applications group for
   the program.

<P><LI>Double-click the icon to start the application. You will receive
   the following error message:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Application Execution Error
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      Cannot find File F:\dir (or one of its components); check to
      ensure the path and filename are correct and that all required
      libraries are available.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Choose the OK button to clear the error message.
<P>
</OL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
If the application is on a FAT partition, the directory must be
renamed to remove any illegal MS-DOS characters, such as spaces.
<P>
If the application is on an NTFS partition, select the icon in the
Applications group and from the File menu, choose Properties. On the
command line, place quotation marks around the entire line and choose
OK. The icon should now be able to open the application.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.1
and Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1. We are researching this
problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base as it becomes available.
