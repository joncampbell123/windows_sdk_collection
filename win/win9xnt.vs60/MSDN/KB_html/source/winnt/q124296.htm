<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you are logged on to a machine and the system account has run a
scheduled batch job consisting of NET USE commands, you can see the network
drive icons in File Manager. If you attempt to access the drive icons, the
following error message appears:
<P>
<PRE>   Login Failure: The user has not been granted the requested logon type at
   this computer.

</PRE>For example, an administrator may use the system or other administrative
account to schedule the following batch file to run when another user has
logged on to the workstation:
<P>
<PRE>   atnetuse.cmd
   net use x: \\server\share /user:domain\administrator password

</PRE>NOTE: You cannot see the drives using NET USE at a command prompt.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Because the administrator has more rights than a typical user, it appears
that the scheduled job should not appear in any form to the user. Although
this appears to be a bug, the situation occurs by design. Since drive
letters are MS-DOS devices, they are global to the system.
