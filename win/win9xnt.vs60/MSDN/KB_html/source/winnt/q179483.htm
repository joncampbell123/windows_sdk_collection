<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Users on computers running Windows NT report the following error:
<P>
<PRE>   No more connections can be made at this remote computer at this time
   because there are already as many connections as the computer can
   accept.

</PRE>Users on computers running Windows 95 report the following error:
<P>
<PRE>   This request is not accepted by the network. Try again later.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The user may be attempting to connect to a share that is configured to
allows a specific number of connections, and that number of connections has
been reached. Check the properties on the share on the server.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
If the specified number of connections has been reached, increase the user
limit or set the value to "maximum allowed."
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
There are several other parameters that you can check when troubleshooting
a problem with limited connections to the computer.

<UL><LI>Verify that the computer is running a retail version of Windows NT. To
   verify this, check the Licensing tool in Control Panel and make sure
   that the following message does not appear:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Not available in NFR (Not for Resale)/MSDN Edition of Windows NT
      Server.
</PRE>
<LI>The server may be configured with Per Server licensing and the number of
   licenses may be exhausted. A quick check to see if this is the problem
   would be turn off the License Logging Service on the computer.

<LI>Check to see if the server was configured by upgrading a computer
   running Windows NT Workstation to Windows NT Server. If it was, the
   following registry parameter may need to be increased from a hex value
   of (10) to 0xFFFFFFFF:
<P>
<P><PRE>      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanManServer
      \Parameters\Users
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for
   readability.
