The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Windows NT operating system version 3.1
<LI>Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
<P>
</UL>The article contains REGISTRY Parameter Subkey entries
for Network Adapter Cards. For information on these
entries:

<UL><LI>NetRules Subkey
<LI>Linkage Subkey Entries for Network Components
<P>
</UL>See the article "Network Adapter Cards Entries, Part 1" for
information on other NAC entries.
 
<P>
<P><h2>Network Adapter Cards Entries</h2>
 
<P>
This section describes specific Registry entries related to network adapter
cards and the drivers for network adapters. Windows NT supports network
adapter drivers under the NDIS 3.0 specification (Network Device Interface
Specification).
<P>
The CurrentControlSet\Services subkey for a network driver or adapter card
includes the standard entries found in the Services subkeys, with the
following default values:
<P>
<PRE>Value            Value
</PRE>Entry
<P>
<PRE>ErrorControl     0x1 (normal)
Start            0x3 (load on demand)
Type             0x1 or 0x4 (driver or adapter)

</PRE>The following sections describe entries in the other areas of the Registry
that contain configuration information for network adapter cards and their
drivers, including:

<UL><LI>NetRules subkeys under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE for
   drivers and adapters. (In "Network Adapter Cards Entries,
   PART 1".)

<LI>Linkage subkey entries under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM
   for drivers and adapters, defining information about
   bindings for the component. (In "Network Adapter Cards
   Entries, PART 1".)

<LI>Parameter subkey entries under
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM for network card adapters,
   defining specific information such as the IRQ number, I/O
   base address, and other details. (In this article.)
<P>
</UL>The information provided here is chiefly to be used for informational and
troubleshooting purposes. The settings for either the NDIS driver or the
network adapter card should be changed using the Network icon in Control
Panel.
<P>
For information about Registry values for other network services, see the
appropriate article in the "Network Services Entries" article series.
Entries for TCP/IP that are specific to network adapter cards can be found
under see the articles "TCP/IP Transport Entries" Part 1 and Part 2.
<P>
<P><h3>Parameters Subkey Entries</h3>
 
<P>
Each network adapter card has a Parameters subkey with value entries that
contain the settings for interrupt number, I/O port, and other parameters.
These entries are found under subkeys for specific adapter cards in this
Registry path:
<P>
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet
<PRE>     \Services\adapter name#\Parameters

</PRE>These values should all be set by choosing the Network icon in Control
Panel. These value entries are provided here for informational purposes
only. For a list of default values for network adapter card settings, see
the table at the end of this section.
<P>
<PRE>BusNumber     REG_DWORD     Number
</PRE>Defines the bus number, beginning with 0 in the common case where the
computer has one bus type, whether it is ISA, EISA, MCA, or TurboChannel.
For the rare computer that has more than one bus, bus number 2 has the
value of 1, and so on.
<P>
This value should be maintained by the system. You cannot change it using
the Network dialog box in Control Panel.
Default: Usually 0 (depends on the installation)
<P>
<PRE>BusType      REG_DWORD     Number
</PRE>Specifies the bus type for the computer, as in the following list:
<P>
<PRE>Value          Bus type

0          MIPS (Jazz-Internal bus)
1          ISA bus
2          EISA bus
3          MCA bus
4          TcChannel bus


</PRE>This value should be maintained by the system. You cannot change it using
the Network dialog box in Control Panel.
<P>
<PRE>CableType      REG_DWORD     1 or 2
</PRE>Specifies the cable type as unshielded twisted pair (UTP=1) or shielded
twisted pair (NTSETUP=2), for Proteon 1390 adapter cards.
<P>
<PRE>CardSpeed      REG_DWORD     4 or 16 megabits per second
</PRE>Specifies card speed as 4 or 16 megabits per second in hex (0x4 or 0x10),
for Proteon 1390 adapter cards.
<P>
<PRE>CardType      REG_DWORD     Number
</PRE>Specifies the card installed in the system. For some manufacturers, all
their network cards use the same driver, which checks the value of CardType
to determine the network card model number of the installed card. For
example:
<P>
<PRE>CardType          Network card model number value

DEC:
1          DEC100
2          DEC20x
3          DEC PC
4          DEC Station
5          DEC422
7          DEC101

</PRE>Proteon:
<PRE>1          Proteon 1390
2          Proteon 1990

</PRE>Ungermann-
Bass:
<PRE>2          UB PC
3          UB EOTP
4          UBPS


</PRE>This value should be maintained by the system. You cannot change it using
the Network dialog box in Control Panel.
<P>
<PRE>DMAChannel      REG_DWORD     5, 6, or 7
</PRE>Specifies the DMA channel used by the adapter card.
<P>
<PRE>InterruptNumber      REG_DWORD     IRQ number
</PRE>Specifies the interrupt level (IRQ) for the adapter card.
IRQ5 is a common choice (0x5).
<P>
<PRE>IoBaseAddress      REG_DWORD     Number in hex
</PRE>For some adapters, this entry specifies the I/O port base address as a
hexadecimal string. For other adapters, this entry specifies whether this
is the primary adapter card (1) or a secondary card (2).
<P>
<PRE>MediaType      REG_DWORD     Number
</PRE>Specifies the network type, as follows:
<P>
<PRE>Value      Network type

1          Ethernet
2          IBM Token Ring
3          ARCnet
4          FDDI network
5          Apple LocalTalk


</PRE>This value should be maintained by the system. You cannot change it using
the Network dialog box in Control Panel.
<P>
<PRE>MaximumPacketSize      REG_DWORD     Number
</PRE>Specifies the maximum packet size that the IBM Token Ring adapter is
allowed to transmit. Use this parameter when sending data across bridges
that may have smaller packet sizes available on the destination network
than on the native network. You cannot change this parameter using the
Network dialog box in Control Panel.
<P>
<PRE>MemoryMapped      REG_DWORD     0 or 1
</PRE>Specifies whether the adapter card is memory mapped.
<P>
<PRE>MemoryMappedBaseAddress      REG_DWORD     Memory address in hex
</PRE>Specifies the base memory (I/O) address used by the adapter card. This
number must match the card’s memory address settings as specified by its
manufacturer.
<P>
<PRE>NetworkAddress     REG_SZ     Number
</PRE>Specifies the address the network adapter should use instead of the burned-
in address. For example, for the IBM Token Ring card, this value is
40000000203. You can change this value for Token Ring adapters using the
Network dialog box in Control Panel, but not for Ethernet adapters.
<P>
<PRE>Transceiver      REG_DWORD     1 or 2
</PRE>Specifies the transceiver as External (1) or OnBoard (2). This value should
be 1 for a DEC/Intel/Xerox (DIX) connection.
<P>
The following table summarizes default settings for various card types.
