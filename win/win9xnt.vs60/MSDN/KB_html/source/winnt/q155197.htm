</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Unattended Setup is the method by which original equipment manufacturers
(OEMs), corporations, and other users install Windows NT in unattended
mode. To start Windows NT Setup in unattended mode, you must specify the
following command
<P>
<PRE>   winnt[32] /u:&lt;answer file&gt; /s:&lt;install source&gt;

</PRE>where &lt;answer file&gt; is a file containing information to automate the
installation process and &lt;install source&gt; is the location of the Windows
NT installation files. In this article, &lt;answer file&gt; is referred to as
the Unattend.txt file.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Unattend.txt File Format</h3>
 
<P>
In general, an answer file consists of section headers, parameters, and
values for those parameters. Most of the section headers are predefined
(although some may be user-defined). It is not necessary to specify all
the possible parameters and keys in the Unattend.txt file if the
installation does not require them. The file format is as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   [section1]
   ;
   ; Section contains keys and the corresponding
   ; values for those keys/parameters.
   ; keys and values are separated by "=" signs
   ; Values usually require double quotes "" around them
   ;
   key = value
   .
   .

   [section2]
   key = value
   .
   .

</PRE><h3>Description of Unattend.txt File Parameters</h3>
 
<P>
[Unattended]
<P>
This section header is used to identify whether an unattended
installation is being performed or not. It should exist or the
Unattend.txt file will be ignored. Parameters that can exist in this
section are discussed below.
<P>
OemPreinstall
Value: Yes | No
Determines whether an OEM preinstallation is being performed or not. When
the value is Yes, other subdirectories will be copied if they exist. No
means a regular unattended Setup is being performed copying only the
Inetsrv, System32 and Drvlib.nic subdirectories.  If using sysdiff and you
performed a sysdiff /inf, this value must be set to Yes.
<P>
NoWaitAfterTextMode
Value: 0 | 1
This key determines whether the text mode portion of Setup should
automatically boot into GUI mode or not. It is only valid when
OemPreinstall = Yes. The default behavior is to halt after text mode
during a preinstallation. 0 indicates that Setup should halt after text
mode and 1 indicates that Setup should automatically reboot into GUI mode
after text mode is complete.
<P>
NoWaitAfterGuiMode
Value: 0 | 1
This key determines whether the GUI mode portion of Setup should
automatically reboot to the logon screen or not. It is only valid when
OemPreinstall = Yes. The default behavior is to halt at the end of GUI
mode Setup. 0 indicates that Setup should halt after GUI mode and 1
indicates that Setup should automatically reboot after GUI mode is
complete.
<P>
FileSystem
Value: ConvertNTFS | LeaveAlone
This key specifies whether the primary partition should be converted to
NTFS or left alone. In general, partitions greater than 512MB should be
converted to NTFS.  If this value is set to "CovertNTFS" it is done during
after the first reboot of unattended setup.
<P>
ExtendOemPartition
Value: 0 | 1
The ExtendOemPartition key is used to install Windows NT on a disk that
is larger than 2 GB in size. This key causes text-mode Setup to extend
the partition on which the temporary Windows NT sources are located into
any available unpartitioned space that physically follows it on the disk.
The temporary install source must be a primary partition and limited to
1024 cylinders only. Writing beyond the 1024th cylinder will cause the
installation to fail. 0 implies that the partition will not be extended
and 1 indicates that it should be extended. When the value is 1, the
FileSystem key must be set to ConvertNTFS.  When the value is set to 1,
oempreinstall must be equal to yes.
<P>
For example if you have a 4 GB hard disk, most DOS based partitioning
tools use a translation of 1024 cylinders which works out to about 2GB.
This is a limitation of 1024 cylinders boundry.  WHen you have this value
set to "1", it will extened the drive out to the maximum of 4GB or
remainder of space on hard disk.
<P>
ConfirmHardware
Value: Yes | No
This key determines whether a user should manually confirm hardware and
mass storage devices detected by the Setup program. Yes indicates that a
user must manually confirm the hardware detected and No implies Setup
should install the detected devices. For a complete unattended
installation, this key should be set to No.
<P>
NtUpgrade
Values: Yes | No | Manual | Single
This key determines whether a previous version of Windows NT Workstation
or Server should be upgraded or not. It should be set in order to perform
an upgrade. Yes indicates that the detected Windows NT installation
should be upgraded. If multiple installations are detected, the first
installation found is upgraded. No implies that the upgrade should be
aborted if a Windows NT installation is found. This is the appropriate
value when OemPreinstall = Yes. Manual implies that the user must specify
which previous installation should be upgraded. Single indicates that the
upgrade should continue only if a single Windows NT installation is
found. If multiple installations are found, the user must manually select
which installation to upgrade.
<P>
Win31Upgrade
Values: Yes | No
The Win31Upgrade key determines whether previous installations of Windows
or Windows for Workgroups 3.x should be upgraded to Windows NT. Yes
indicates that the Windows installation should be upgraded and No means
do not upgrade the installation if found.
<P>
OverwriteOemFilesOnUpgrade
Values: Yes | No
This key determines whether OEM-supplied files that have the same name as
Windows NT system files should be overwritten during an unattended
upgrade or not. Yes means overwrite the files and No means do not
overwrite if found. The default behavior is to overwrite OEM-supplied
files.
<P>
TargetPath
Values: * | &lt;path name&gt; | Manual
This key determines the installation directory in which Windows NT should
be installed, and implies that Setup should generate a unique directory
name for the installation. This is usually WINNT.x where x is 0, 1, and
so on. &lt;path name&gt; is user-defined installation directory. Manual
indicates that Setup should prompt the user to enter the installation
path. Note, we do not use drive letters in this value,  For example if you
want to have NT install to winnt40, your unattend.txt should have the
value:
<P>
<PRE>  TargetPath = \winnt40

</PRE>NOTE: Do not use drive letters such as c:\winnt or d:\winntws. To specify
a
drive other than the boot partition, you must use the commandline switch
/t: with your setup command. For example, "winnt32.exe /t:d:" (without the
quotes) to install Windows NT to the D drive.
<P>
ComputerType
Values: &lt;hal description&gt; [, Retail | OEM]
This key indicates the type of Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) to be
loaded by the Setup Loader, and installed by text-mode Setup. If this key
is not present, Setup will attempt to detect the type of computer and
install the appropriate retail HAL. It is only valid when OemPreinstall =
Yes. The &lt;hal description&gt; string identifies the HAL to be installed. It
must match one of the strings in the [Computer] section of the
Txtsetup.sif file (for a retail HAL), or the Txtsetup.oem file (for an
OEM HAL). Retail informs Setup that the HAL to be installed is part of
the Windows NT product. OEM indicates that the HAL to be loaded is OEM-
supplied. If the HAL is OEM-supplied, the driver name must also be listed
in the [OemBootFiles] section of the Unattend.txt file.  Listed below are
some examples of these values:
<P>
<PRE>   Descriptions are from the COMPUTER Section of TXTSETUP.SIF
   ----------------------------------------------------------

   ComputerType = "AST Manhattan SMP","RETAIL"
   ComputerType = "Compaq SystemPro Multiprocessor or 100%
   Compatible","RETAIL"

   ComputerType = "Standard PC with C-Step i486","RETAIL"
   ComputerType = "Wyse Series 7000i Model 740MP/760MP","RETAIL"

</PRE>If you have your own special HAL, your line should read as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   ComputerType = "This is my special HAL","OEM"

</PRE>Remember that when you use an OEM supplied HAL, the driver name must also
exist in the [OemBootFiles] section.
<P>

Workstations To Domain. Note that for this value to work, the network card
must be able to contact the Domain controller.  This is crucial for
computers that are only using the TCPIP protocol and Domain controller is
on a different segment.  We must have a way to resolve the  IP address. If
the account does not have the priveliges to add workstations to the domain
or cannot contact the domain controller, setup will prompt you that it
failed to create the account and bring you back to the Join domain dialog.
<P>
InstallDC
Value: &lt;domain name&gt;
This key is used to specify the name of a domain to be installed. It is

example:
<P>
<PRE>   LimitTo = AMDPCN

</PRE> 
<P>
[&lt;Install Adapters Section&gt;]
<P>
&lt;Netcard Inf option&gt; = &lt;netcard parameter section&gt;, &lt;oem path&gt;
<P>
&lt;Netcard Inf option&gt;
Value: &lt;netcard parameter section&gt;
This key points Setup to the section that contains descriptions for a
particular network adapter card. The &lt;netcard inf options&gt; for particular
cards can be found in the [Options] section of the corresponding
Oemnadxx.inf files. Example:
<P>
<PRE>   [Installadapters]
   AMDPCN = AMDPCNParameters

</PRE>&lt;oem path&gt;
The oem_path points to the location of the OEM supplied  files.  If the
path starts with a drive letter, then the literal path is used to find the
OEM driver. If, however, the path starts with a backwards slash (\), then
the path given will be appended to the path to the installation source.
Example:
<P>
for a driver located in $OEM$\NET\subdirectory_a, oem_path would be set to
\$OEM$\NET\subdirectory_a.
<P>
 
<P>
[&lt;netcard parameter section&gt;]
<P>
This section contains the parameters for a particular network adapter
card whose &lt;netcard inf option&gt; has been specified in the [&lt;Detect
Adapters Section&gt;] or the [&lt;Install Adapters Section&gt;] of the
Unattend.txt file. These values can be found by parsing the appropriate
Oemnadxx.inf, or oemsetup.inf file for the network card. They can also be
found by looking the in the registry of a NT machine with the adapter
already installed and functioning properly. To do this, use Regedt32.exe
and look in the following registry key:
<P>
<PRE>   Hkey_local_machine\system\currentcontrolset\services
   \&lt;%netcardkeyname%&gt;X

</PRE>where X = 1 or ordinal of adapter installed. In this key look at the
parameters key and note the values. Note!! all values in the registry
appear as Hex but in your unattend.txt file, these values must be
converted to decimal. For example, the value of IOBaseAddress =0x300 in
the registry must be set to IOBaseAddress = 768 in the answer file.
Listed below is an example of these parameters:
<P>
<PRE>   [EE16Params]
   !AutoNetInterfaceType = 1
   Transceiver = 3
   !AutoNetBusNumber = 0
   IoChannelReady = 2
   IoBaseAddress = 784
