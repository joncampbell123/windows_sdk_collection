<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
You can change a Windows NT User Account password that is on any Windows
NT computer from any other Windows NT computer regardless of whether the
User Account is on a Workstation, a stand-alone Server, or a Windows NT
domain controller. Additionally, it makes no difference whether the
password being changed from a Workstation, a stand-alone Server, or a
Windows NT domain controller.
<P>
You do not have to be logged on from the User Account Database that
contains the Username, and you do not have to be currently logged on with
that Username. This procedure is especially useful if you want to change
your password in a User Account Database or security accounts manager
(SAM) that is not in your default logon domain.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To change your password, perform the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Press CTRL + ALT + DEL to bring up the Windows NT Security dialog box.

<P><LI>Press the Change Password button.

<P><LI>Enter the Username whose password you wish to change.

<P><LI>In the From dialog box, select either the Computer Name or Domain Name
   from the drop-down list box, or type the Computer name or Domain
   Name that contains the User Account Database where the Username
   exists.

<P><LI>Type the appropriate Old Password, New Password, and Confirm New
   Password.

<P><LI>You should receive a message indicating "Your password has been
   changed."
<P>
</OL>This procedure is allowed even if the User Right "Access this computer
from network" is disabled for the group Everyone. Changing a password does
not use resources on the server. The ability to change a password without
requiring the user to be logged on allows a user to change his or her
password outside of the user's logon hours, or when the password has
expired and the user is not able to log on.
<P>
The user receive the following error messages:
<P>
<PRE>   System error 2242 has occurred.
   The password of this user has expired.

   From NET HELPMSG 2242:
   Your password has expired. You will not be able to perform any network
   tasks until you change your password.

   ACTION
   To change your password, press Ctrl+Alt+Del and then select Change
   Password.
