The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you access roaming profiles across a wide area network (WAN) link,
the default user profile may overwrite the roaming profile stored on the
remote server.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior can occur if Windows NT is unable to connect to the remote
server on which the roaming profile is stored during logon. When the
Windows NT session is ended, if the remote server is then available, the
local profile is used to update the roaming profile.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Accessing roaming profiles across a WAN link is not recommended. This
configuration may cause increased network traffic and issues with profile
synchronization. If you must use roaming profiles, use one of the following
methods:

<UL><LI>If users do not change remote offices, assign profiles in User Manger
   to a local computer using a UNC name. For example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      \\Server\Profiles\Username
</PRE>
<LI>If users change remote locations frequently, store the roaming profiles
   locally and use directory replication with import and export servers to
   keep the profiles synchronized across remote sites. You may also want
   to consider copying the profiles to all computers.

<LI>Implement mandatory profiles.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
There is no way to prevent Windows NT from copying a newly created locally
cached user profile to the remotely stored profile.
<P>
This feature is under review and will be considered for inclusion in a
future release of Windows NT.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When a user account is configured to use roaming profiles in Windows NT
Workstation 4.0, if at logon the computer is unable to contact the server
on which the profiles are stored, the locally cached profile is used. If
no locally cached profile is present, the default user profile is copied
and used as the locally cached profile.
<P>
When the user logs off, Windows NT attempts to close all network
connections and attempts to save the profile to the remote server. If
a connection is established with the remote server, the profile assigned
to the user (a copy of the default user profile) overwrites the remotely
stored profile. Windows NT checks the remote profile's date and time stamp
and compares it to the local profile. Because the local profile assigned
to the user has a newer date and time stamp, it overwrites the remote
profile.
