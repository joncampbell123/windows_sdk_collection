The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When starting a console application (a Windows NT Service can qualify as a
console application) that starts another console application, an access
violation occurs in CSRSS.EXE when the second application terminates.
<P>
This results in the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   STOP: c000021a {Fatal System Error}
   The Windows SubSystem system process terminated unexpectedly
   with a status of 0xc0000037 (0x5fe625cf 0x02c1faa0).
   The system has been shutdown.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem is exposed by a console application (typically a service)
which has the following behavior:

<UL><LI>They start new applications using LogonUser() followed by
   CreateProcessAsUser(). The allows a child process to be started with a
   different security context than the parent.

<LI>The parent application has a console window, and the child application
   is started in a way as to share the same console window (i.e. when using
   CreateProcessAsUser, the dwCreationFlags did not specify the use of
   CREATE_NEW_CONSOLE).
<P>
</UL>A change in WINSRV.DLL for Windows NT 3.51 Service Pack 4 prevents a
process from inheriting the window station and desktop of its parent
process, if the child process was started in a different logon context.
CreateProcessAsUser is used to start new applications under a new logon
context.
<P>
As a result of this change, the application started has NO window station
or desktop defined because it is trying to use the Console of its parent
which is not permitted.
<P>
A problem in WINSRV.DLL (used by CSRSS.EXE) assumed that a desktop would
always be defined. This caused an Access Violation when the WINSRV.DLL
attempted to access the desktop while cleaning up resources owned by the
process, as the process terminated.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
The problem in WINSRV.DLL has been corrected for the case where no desktop
has been created.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51.
This problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
