<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article discusses strategies and tools for performing unattended
installations of Microsoft Windows NT 4.0.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Automating Windows NT installation is a key step in reducing the cost of
migration. The method of Setup automation depends upon the existing
network infrastructure, the number and variety of computers to be
upgraded, the schedule for deployment, and other factors. Based on
these criteria, the following options can help you smoothly deploy
Windows NT Workstation:

<OL><P><LI>Use Setup Manager to create unattended answer files.
<P>
   By creating an unattended answer file with predetermined answers for
   installation questions, the installation process can run from start to
   finish with limited or no user intervention.

<P><LI>Use management software such as Microsoft Systems Management Server.
<P>
   With software such as Systems Management Server, you can "push" the
   installation from the server, so that you can install Windows NT
   Workstation 4.0 on an individual personal computer without ever
   touching the computer. This allows a small installation team to deploy
   Windows NT Workstation to a large number of computers in a short period
   of time. In addition, this method requires little or no work on the
   part of the end-users. This allows end-users to stay focused on
   productive work for the organization, and eliminates a potential source
   of installation errors.
<P>
   This method is possible only with a system management program such as
   Systems Management Server. If you plan to use system management soft-
   ware in automating the installation, make sure this has been acquired
   and tested.
<P>
   Because you can use Systems Management Server to gather detailed
   information about the resources already in use on your network, you
   might want to begin using it during the earliest stages of the
   deployment process. You can then use it to simplify the pilot and final
   roll-out.

<P><LI>Modify login scripts, or send embedded setup scripts in e-mail.
<P>
   You can automate the installation process by editing the login script
   for the user, or by sending a link in e-mail to a batch file that runs
   Windows NT Workstation 4.0 Setup. In these cases, the user only needs
   to log on or double-click an icon to start the installation.

<P><LI>Use the Sysdiff tool.
<P>
   The Sysdiff tool allows you to record the variations between a standard
   retail installation of Windows NT Workstation and a customized version.
   If the difference file created by Sysdiff is available during Setup,
   the Setup program applies the differences automatically.
<P>
   Use the Sysdiff tool to include programs in your customized
   installation of Windows NT Workstation. The Sysdiff tool is discussed
   in Chapter 2, "Customizing Windows NT Setup," in the "Windows 32-Bit
   Deployment Guide" document available on the World Wide Web at:

</PRE>
<P><LI>Use third-party solutions (including OEM preinstallation).
<P>
   Your organization may choose a third-party solution for deploying
   Windows NT Workstation. These include custom solutions made available
   through a Microsoft Solution Provider, or preinstallation of the
   operating system by an OEM (original equipment manufacturer).
