The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
Microsoft Windows NT and Windows NT Advanced Server do not impose any
limitations on the number of shares they can have. They also do not have
set limits on the number of users who can access the server.
<P>
Although there is a limit of 254 NetBIOS sessions for each process within
Windows NT, it does not apply to the default workstation or server
components. The workstation and server services writes to TDI directly
instead of calling for NetBIOS services. The TDI is a 32-bit interface and
hence such a limit is no longer applicable.
<P>
In addition, NBF (NetBIOS Frame) has a unique way of creating virtually an
unlimited number of connections. A TDI handle is associated with each Local
Session Number (LSN) and the corresponding Network Address. The TDI handle
is then related to the process that established the connection. The
translation of a process ID and LSN into a TDI handle is done by
NETBIOS.SYS.
<P>
For each binding path (LANA number) there can be 254 sessions per process.
Windows NT provides separate address space for each process. The number of
processes is thus limited by the available memory. In other words, the
limitation on the number of shares or users depends on the available
resources. By themselves, Windows NT and Windows NT Advanced Server do not
impose any of these limitations. The total amount of memory available for
all processes in a 32-bit scheme is 2 gigabytes (GB) ( 2 GB for system and
2 GB for programs) which can provide the address space for a very large
number of processes.
<P>
For more information please refer to pages 13 and 632-637 of the Microsoft
Windows NT Resource Guide, Volume 1.
