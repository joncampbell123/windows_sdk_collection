<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) is a replacement for older
analog phone lines, which typically communicate at speeds of 9600 bits per
second. ISDN communicates at speeds of 64 or 128 kilobits per second. The
DigiBoard PCIMAC ISA ISDN adapter allows Windows NT 3.1 to access ISDN
lines through Remote Access Service (RAS).
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If neither RAS nor the DigiBoard PCIMAC ISA adapter have been installed
yet, do the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Install the DigiBoard PCIMAC card in the computer, setting jumper
   switches for I/O Port Starting Address to not conflict with any other
   hardware devices in your computer.

<P><LI>In the Control Panel window, choose the Network icon, and then choose
   the Add Adapter button. In the list box, select DigiBoard PCIMAC - ISA
   Adapter, and then choose the Continue button. In the Adapter Card Setup
   dialog box, enter the appropriate settings for IRQ Level, I/O Base
   Address, Memory Base Address, Switch Type and Line Options. (If you are
   uncertain of the settings for Switch Type or Line Options, contact your
   ISDN service provider.) Choose the OK button.

<P><LI>Add RAS by choosing the Add Software button, select Remote Access
   Service, choose the Continue button, and then enter the path to the
   distribution files.

<P><LI>After the RAS files are copied, the Remote Access Setup dialog
   box appears. Choose the Add button. In the Add Port dialog box, select
   the appropriate ISDN port, and then choose OK.
<P>
   5. In the Configure Port dialog box, select from the Port Usage options
   (Dial out only, Receive calls only, or Dial out and Receive calls).
   Choose the Settings button and change the Line Type, Negotiate Line
   Type, and Enable Hardware Compression settings, if necessary. (If you
   are uncertain what to enter here, contact the ISDN service provider and
   DigiBoard.) In the Remote Access Setup dialog box, choose OK for
   Settings, choose OK for Configure Port, and then choose Continue. The
   ISDN port for use with RAS has now been added. Choose OK at Remote
   Access Service Setup message, choose OK on Network Settings, and then
   Yes to shut down the computer. RAS and the DigiBoard PCIMAC adapter are
   now configured.

<P><LI>Start RAS by choosing the Add button, and then add a phone book entry to
   communicate over the ISDN line. Enter the appropriate Entry Name, Phone
   Number, and so on, and then select the port that the DigiBoard PCIMAC
   ISDN adapter is configured on. If you need to change any ISDN settings,
   choose the ISDN button. When the phone book entry information is
   complete, choose OK and you are ready to call out on the ISDN line. If
   RAS is installed prior to adding the DigiBoard PCIMAC ISDN adapter, this
   information still applies, except that you need to go into Networks
   applet of Control Panel, and in the Installed Network Software list box,
   select Remote Access Service. Choose the Configure button and add the
   ISDN port (as described in steps 4 and 5 above).
