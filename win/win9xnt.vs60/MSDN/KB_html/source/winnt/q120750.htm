<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article explains how to set up a video capture driver or Video Spigot
and solve common problems encountered in this process.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 

<OL><P><LI>Shut down your machine and install the video card.

<P><LI>Connect a camera and turn it on.

<P><LI>Reboot.

<P><LI>In Program Manager select Main, Control Panel, Drivers and Add.
<P>
   NOTE: Drivers for this card for all three platforms (x86, MIPS, Alpha)
   are in the NT CD-ROM in ntcdfree\drvlib\capture

<P><LI>You need to select an interrupt and an address. For top of the line
   video cards the address should be C8000 or greater. When you find an
   address that works, select OK and Close to return to the Control Panel
   main display.
<P>
   Even if the driver functions, you still may have a conflict with another
   driver that does not correctly report its usage.

<P><LI>Start VIDCAP32.EXE. (It's in the Software Development Toolkit (SDK) in
   the MSTOOLS directory. If a picture is displayed when you start
   VIDCAP32.EXE, the installation has been successful.

<P><LI>If the screen remains black, select Options then Video Format. Use the
   list box to select a format other than Palletized (something such as 16
   bit RGB 5-5-5) and select OK.

<P><LI>If the screen remains black, check your camera, power supply, cables
   and so on. If the screen is a solid color, you probably have an address
   conflict. Exit from VIDCAP32, go back to Control Panel and choose Video
   Spigot (often the last driver in the list) and Setup.

<P><LI>Select a new address and try again. You shouldn't need a new interrupt.
<P>
</OL>Video Spigot is manufactured by a vendor independent of Microsoft; we make
no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's performance or
reliability.
