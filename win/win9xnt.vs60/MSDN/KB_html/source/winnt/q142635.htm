The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Disk Administrator will not allow you to change the logical drive
letters of removable media drives such as an Iomega Zip, Jaz drives or
Media Optical (MO) and recordable cd-rom drives.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Windows NT assigns drive letters first to physical devices, then to logical
subdivisions/partitions. Therefore a removable drive such as JAZ and ZIP
will receive a letter before any logical partitions.
<P>
For example, if there are two hard drives, each with two partitions, and a
removable drive, the drive letters will be assigned as follows:

<UL><LI> First drive, first partition = C:

<LI> Second drive, first partition = D:

<LI> Removable (ZIP, JAZ etc ..) drive = E:

<LI> First drive, second partition = F:

<LI> Second drive, second partition = G:
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To ensure that the logical drive in question receives a certain drive
letter:

<OL><P><LI>With a disk in the removable drive, start Disk Administrator and look
   at how the devices have been identified.

<P><LI>Change the drive letters of the hard disk drive and CDROM devices to
   their desired locations. If a desired letter is being used by the
   removable drive, decide what letter the removable should use and make
   sure it is available.

<P><LI>Shut down the computer and disconnect the removable drive.

<P><LI>Restart. Use Disk Administrator to make any changes to drive letters.
   Any drive letter previously used by the removable drive should be
   available for use. Be sure to leave the desired letter available for
   the removable drive. Make the drive letters statically defined in the
   registry by highlighting each partition in turn and choosing Assign
   drive letter... from the Tools menu. Then placing it at the drive letter
   you want it to be clicking the OK button.

<P><LI>Shut down the computer, reconnect the removable drive, and restart.
<P>
</OL>CAUTION: If the Windows NT system files are installed to a logical
partition, and a removable drive is added to the system, the boot partition
for Windows NT will be given a new letter. A message stating that the "ARC
Path Needs To Be Changed" will appear. Until this correction is made in the
Boot.ini file, Windows NT will not boot. When this correction is made,
there are many registry entries that will not be changed and will still
refer to the old location of the Windows NT system files. Therefore, it is
recommended that the Windows NT system files be installed to a primary
partition on a drive, not a logical one.
