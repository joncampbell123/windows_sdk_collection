<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
</UL>

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
With the DLC protocol under Windows NT, you can select only one Network
Interface Card (NIC) for printing to Hewlett-Packard Co. (HP) Jetdirect or
other network printers. If your Windows NT machine has two NIC's on
different network segments with HP Jetdirect printers, you can print to or
share a printer from only one segment at a time.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This is a limitation of HPMON, which controls DLC printing in Windows NT.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To print to the second NIC (or segment), you have to select a different
adapter from the Advanced Options for HP Network Ports option in Print
Manager, then reboot the machine.
<P>
When you select the Secondary(1) adapter, you are prompted to restart the
Spooler service. To do this, run Control Panel, choose Services, select
Spooler, choose stop, and then choose start. When you go back into Print
Manager and create the printer, the Advanced Options for HP Network Ports
dialog box displays the JetDirect addresses on the secondary network
adapter.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
By default the HP printer software, HPMON, uses the "primary" adapter
setting. If you set up the HP printer on the "secondary" adapter, print
jobs will be lost.
<P>
The primary or secondary adapters correspond to the first and second NIC's
that the DLC protocol is bound to.
<P>
To view the DLC binding order:

<OL><P><LI>In Control Panel, choose the Network icon. Choose Bindings. Choose DLC
   protocol.

<P><LI>From Print Manager, choose the "Printer" connected to the physical HP
   network print device.

<P><LI>Select settings.

<P><LI>When the "Configure HP Network peripheral port option" window appears,
   click on the Options button.

<P><LI>The window titled "Advanced option for all HP network ports" appears.
   The adapter choice is listed here.

<P><LI>Choose the appropriate adapter, according to the DLC protocol binding
   list, or change the bind order to match the primary and secondary
   settings.

<P><LI>Open Control Panel - Services, select Spooler, then stop and restart the
   Spooler service.

<P><LI>Go back to Print Manager and view the HP JetDirect addresses; these
   addresses are on the network connected to the secondary network adapter.

<P><LI>Select the desired printer and complete printer setup.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: Since Windows NT does not rely on LANA numbers, changing the binding
order does not affect system performance in any way. For more information
on binding order, refer to article <B><A href="../winnt/q103275.htm">Q103275</A></B>: How to Find LANA Numbers for
Applications.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This limitation is by design. HPMON is owned by Hewlett Packard Co.
