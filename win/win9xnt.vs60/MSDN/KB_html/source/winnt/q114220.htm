The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
You can use Performance Monitor's Save Workspace option to save and restore
Performance Monitor settings such as its window size and position, and
which view (Chart, Report, Log, or Alert) is active. You can create an icon
for your saved workspace and place it in the Windows NT Startup group so
that Performance Monitor brings up your customized settings when you start
Windows NT.
<P>
MORE INFORMATION
 
<P>
There are procedures below for selecting and restoring Performance Monitor
window settings and view each time you start Windows NT. Before following
them, however, consider the following:

<UL><LI>While there is a way to cause the log file to start automatically, you
   may want to plan carefully before configuring a log file to begin at
   Windows NT start-up. The log file increases in size very quickly, and
   you could easily begin to use up too much disk space. If that is not
   your concern, then you can save the workspace as described below while
   the log file is actually collecting data ( i.e. running). Therefore when
   the Workspace setting file is opened, it will also be running.
<P>
</UL><h3>Saving Your Performance Monitor Settings</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Choose the counters and instances you wish to monitor.

<P><LI>From the View menu in the Performance Monitor window, select Chart,
   Alert, Log, or Report view. Choosing the Log view doesn't automatically
   start logging.

<P><LI>From the Options menu, you can add or remove the Toolbar and Status
   Bar, as well as select the Always on Top option.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Save Workspace then choose a file name and
   directory for the settings file. Choose the .PMW file extension.
<P>
</OL><h3>Adding Your Saved Performance Monitor Setting to the Startup Group</h3>
 
<P>
Option #1:

<OL><P><LI>Go to the File Manager, and select the Workspace setting file you
   just created.

<P><LI>Choose Associate from the File menu, and associate files with a
   .PMW extension with PERFMON.EXE.

<P><LI>Open the Startup group, and tile it with the File Manager window
   so the windows are open side by side.

<P><LI>Use your mouse to drag the newly associated Workspace settings file
   to the Startup group.
<P>
</OL>Option #2:

<OL><P><LI>Minimize the Performance Monitor icon, open the Startup group, and
   drag the Performance Monitor icon to the Startup group.

<P><LI>Select the Performance Monitor icon in the Startup group.

<P><LI>Choose Properties from the File Menu in Program Manager.

<P><LI>In the Program Item Properties dialog box, append the path and file
   name of the Workspace settings file you created to the Command Line,
   then choose "OK."
<P>
</OL>The next time you restart Windows NT, Performance Monitor will display the
position, settings, and view you have saved.
