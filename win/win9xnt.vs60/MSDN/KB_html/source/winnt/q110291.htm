<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Windows NT and Windows NT Advanced Server do not enforce account policy of
minimum password length restriction to new users created from the User
Manager. The behavior is different in Windows NT and Windows NT Advanced
Server as follows:
<P>
If the account policy is made so that the minimum password length must be
at least five characters:

<UL><LI>On a Windows NT Advanced Server machine:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - If a new user is created from the User Manager for domains with just
      the option of "User Must Change Password at Next Logon," any password
      of fewer than five characters is accepted. The user can logon with
      this invalid password and the subsequent password follows the account
      policy and prompts if the password length is less than five
      characters.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - If the new user is created with the remaining options of Password
      Never Expires or Password Cannot Be Changed, the account policy is
      enforced by prompting for a password of at least five characters.
</PRE>
<LI>On a Windows NT machine, a user can be created from User Manager with
   any of the following options and it accepts a password with fewer
   characters than the minimum password length, thereby not following the
   account policy:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - "User Must Change Password at Next Logon"
    - Password Never Expires
    - Password Cannot Be Changed
</PRE><P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT and Windows NT
Advanced Server version 3.1. We are researching this problem and will post
new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
