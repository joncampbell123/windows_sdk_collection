The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Windows NT unattended setup provides the ability to install and configure
Remote Access for Dial In, Dial Out, or Dial In and Out.
<P>
If the unattend answer file is configured to install Remote Access as a
Dial Out client only, server components and registry values are installed
that should not be.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Visual indications of the extra components installed show up when
properties of the Remote Access Service are checked in the Control Panel
Network Services tab. All options will appear as configured correctly for
Dial Out Only. Upon exiting the configuration menu for Remote Access, the
system will reset the bindings and update the registry. Once the updates
are complete, a prompt will appear, asking that the system be rebooted.
Upon reboot, everything is installed correctly and the server side of
Remote Access has been removed.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Currently, the only solution is to manually run through the configuration
options for Remote Access via Control Panel and allow the system to update.
Note that the Dial Out options should be configured as expected based on
the unattended answer file, so there is no need to change any of the
parameters.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Server and
Workstation version 4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following is an example of the Modem and Network sections of an
Unattend.txt file that will reproduce install the extra components of
Remote Access.
