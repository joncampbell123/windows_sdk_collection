The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
This article lists screens that appear during the Windows NT version
3.1 setup process. The primary screens and dialog boxes are listed
sequentially for the setup from CD-ROM process, which begins with the
startup from the disk labeled "Setup Disk for CD-ROM Installation."
Every possible setup screen or event is not listed. Variations in
screen events may occur because of system differences and the
different choices you make during setup. The following list assumes
you used the Custom setup option. The sequence of setup events and
screens documented here are presented only as a guide to help
establish your location in the setup process for troubleshooting
purposes.
<P>
NOTE: Phrases appearing in quotation marks are taken verbatim from the
actual screens. Other phrases are paraphrased for brevity.
<P>
<P><h3>Setup Events</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start the computer from the disk labeled "Setup Disk for CD-ROM
    Installation."

<P><LI>"Windows NT Portable Bootloader" appears on the screen followed by
    a blank screen and then the message: "Setup is inspecting your
    computer's hardware configuration..."

<P><LI>The "Welcome to Setup" screen appears with the following options:
<P>
      - To setup, press ENTER.
      - To repair, press R.
      - To quit, press F3.
<P>
    You are prompted to prepare a high-density floppy disk for drive A.
    This disk doesn't need to be a formatted disk. Label the disk
    "Emergency Repair Disk."

<P><LI>Setup offers the choice of Express (by pressing ENTER) or Custom
    (by pressing C) setup types. It is assumed for the sake of this
    article that you chose Custom.
<P>
</OL><h3>Custom Setup (continued)</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Setup scans for SCSI devices.

<P><LI>Setup displays a list of recognized SCSI devices, if any are
    detected. You then have the option to configure additional SCSI
    devices by pressing S, or to skip this step if there are no additional
    devices, by pressing ENTER.

<P><LI>Setup displays the default system information. This allows you to
    change the following settings:
<P>
      - Computer
      - Display
      - Mouse
      - Keyboard layout
<P>
    Press ENTER for No Changes.

<P><LI>Setup attempts to detect if a previous version of Windows is
    installed. If you have Windows 3.1 (versus Windows NT) installed
    on the system, Setup will ask to install Windows NT in the existing
    Windows directory (press ENTER to accept) or to install to an alternate
    path (press "N" to change). If you choose to install to an alternate
    path, the partition information screen will appear.

<P><LI>Setup configures the hard disk drive and checks it for errors.

<P><LI>After the hard disk drive is checked, Setup copies the appropriate
    files to your drive and the following screen appears:
<P>
       "Setup has successfully configured your computer for Windows NT.
<P>
<PRE>          - Remove any disks in drive A.
          - Press CTRL+ALT+DELETE to restart."

</PRE><P><LI>When you restart your computer, you should see the following screens:
<P>
    a. "NTDETECT v.1.00 Checking Hardware OS Loader..."
    b. The blue setup screen with the Microsoft trademark and the
       system memory count, followed by a check of the file systems on
       the various hard disk drive partitions.
    c. The Windows NT Setup screen.

<P><LI>Once in Setup, you have the option of which language to use.

<P><LI>Setup offers a choice of the following optional tasks:
<P>
       - Set up only the components you select.
       - Set up the network.
       - Set up printers locally.
       - Set up applications already on the hard disk drive.
<P>
    NOTE: The optional Windows components are:
<P>
       - READMEs
       - Accessories
       - Games
       - Screen savers
       - Wallpapers, misc.

<P><LI>You can then set up a local printer(s).

<P><LI>Setup provides a choice for the network adapter card detection.
    The detection choices are: automatic detect, or do not detect (manual
    detection).

<P><LI>If you choose to manually select the network adapter, or if the
    network adapter detection fails, you will have an option for selecting
    the appropriate network adapter.

<P><LI>Setup begins copying the appropriate files. A gray dialog box
    appears in the upper left of the screen with helpful information
    about the various features of Windows NT, such as File Manager,
    Print Manager, Event Viewer, and so on.

<P><LI>The network settings dialog box appears and offers the following
    options:
<P>
       - Add software
       - Add adapter
       - Configure
       - Update
       - Remove

<P><LI>Network configuration (binding) occurs.

<P><LI>You have the option to join a workgroup or domain, and to create
    an account on the domain (if a domain is joined).

<P><LI>Setup then loads Program Manager and the default groups (Main,
    Accessories, Administrative Tools, Games, and Startup).

<P><LI>Setup prompts you to create the Administrator Account for the
    local computer.

<P><LI>Setup prompts you to create a local user account.

<P><LI>The virtual memory settings dialog box appears with the following
    configuration options:
<P>
       - Drive: (user option to select)
       - Space available (MB)
       - Minimize size (MB)
       - Resources size (MB)
       - Size chosen (MB)

<P><LI>You have the option of choosing a time zone and setting the time
    and date. You can also choose to have Windows NT automatically adjust
    for daylight savings time.

<P><LI>You are prompted to insert the disk (prepared in step 3 above)
    labeled "Emergency Repair Disk."

<P><LI>Setup formats the disk and saves the default configuration.

<P><LI>Windows NT is now installed. Setup displays the Restart Computer
    button to restart the computer to Windows NT.
