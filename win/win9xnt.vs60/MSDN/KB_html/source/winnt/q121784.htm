<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
To make management of log files easier on heavily-used FTP servers,
additional FTP server logging options were added to Windows NT version 3.5
after the manuals and Help were finalized.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To make changes to the FTP Server service configuration using Registry
Editor:
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them.
Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of
Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

<OL><P><LI>Run Registry Editor (REGEDT32.EXE).

<P><LI>From the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following key:
<P>
<P><PRE>      \SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\ftpsvc\Parameters
</PRE><P>
   The parameters described below are located under this Registry subkey.
<P>
   The following describes the value entries for FTP Server service
   parameters that can only be set by adding an entry in Registry Editor.
   These value entries do not appear by default in the Registry, so you
   must add an entry if you want to change its default value. The FTP
   Server service must be restarted for changes to take effect.
<P>
   LogFileDirectory
<P><PRE>      Data Type = REG_SZ
      Specifies the target directory for the log files. It will default
      to %SYSTEMROOT%\SYSTEM32 (compatible with current behavior).
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: When you set LogFileDirectory, make sure you create the
   corresponding directory. If you do not, the directory is not created
   automatically and errors occur.
<P>
   LogFileAccess
<P><PRE>      Data Type = REG_DWORD
      Previously, 0 meant don't log, and 1 meant log. This has been
      changed to:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>         0 - Don't log anything.
         1 - Log everything to FTPSVC.LOG (compatible with current
             behavior).
         2 - Create daily logs.

         If daily logs are enabled, then entries are written to a file of
         the form FTYYMMDD.LOG, where YY is the current year, MM is the
         current month, and DD is the current day. A log file generated on
         October 31, 1994 would be named FT941031.LOG. "Today's" log file
         will be held open (just as FTPSVC.LOG is). Whenever an entry is to
         be written to the log, if the day has changed from the previous
         entry, then the previous log is closed, a new log filename is
         generated, and the new log is opened.

</PRE></OL>Note that LogFileDirectory is independent of the LogFileAccess mode. It is
reasonable to specify that the "old-style" FTPSVC.LOG be written to a
directory other than %SYSTEMROOT%\SYSTEM32. Likewise, a "new-style"
FTYYMMDD.LOG file will default to %SYSTEMROOT%\SYSTEM32 if no
LogFileDirectory value is present in the Registry.
