<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you install a second Adaptec 154x SCSI controller in your computer
running Windows NT version 3.51 with Service Pack 2 or 3, the driver fails
to attach to the second adapter and the following events from the AHA154x
are logged in the System log:
<P>
<PRE>   A conflict has been detected between two drivers which claimed two
   overlapping memory regions. Driver Aha154x, with device
   &lt;\Device\ScsiPort1.Translated&gt;, claimed a memory range with starting
   address in data address 0x28 and 0x2c, and length in data address 0x30.

   At the locations in the data area you will find the BIOS address of the
   first adapter.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The driver attempts to use the same BIOS area for the second adapter as it
did for the first one, even if the second adapters BIOS is disabled or at a
different address. Because this address is already in use by the first
adapter, the drivers fails.
<P>
The adapter allocates the BIOS area, however, Windows NT does not use it to
prevent problems with other adapters possibly using that memory addresses
(for example, network adapter cards).
<P>
<P><h2>WORK-AROUND</h2>
 
<P>
If you did not encounter any problems with the driver from the Windows NT
3.51 release, use that driver.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
This problem has been corrected in the latest Service Pack for Windows NT
version 3.51.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51.
This problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51 U.S. Service Pack.
For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):
<P>
<PRE>   S E R V P A C K
