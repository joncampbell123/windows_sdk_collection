<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you start your computer with a floppy disk that is infected with a
virus, Windows NT is not capable of detecting it, which is true with many
operating systems. Some viruses, such as the FORMS virus, may infect the
boot sector of your hard disk drive. This article discusses some methods
of protecting the boot sector of the hard disk drive from viruses.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
There is a misconception that if the partition of the hard disk drive is
NTFS, the information in the partition is secure. NTFS, like other file
systems such as File Allocation Table (FAT) and High Performance File
System (HPFS), is not recognized until Windows NT starts the service for
the file system. The boot sector is separate from the file system in that
it is recognized by the system BIOS upon starting the computer.
<P>
In order to provide C2 level government security, the environment
surrounding the system must meet the same level of security that Windows
NT provides. The C2 standard requires physical security, such as locking
the computer.
<P>
In order to protect your system from any type of virus infection in
Windows NT and possibly recover the boot sector of the hard drive, you can
do the following:

<UL><LI>Remove any floppy disk in drive A after shutting down Windows NT.

<LI>Configure the system BIOS to disable floppy disk booting (no floppy
   seek) or change the order of the boot process to hard drive first.

<LI>Configure the system BIOS to enable system password protection.

<LI>To possibly fix the boot sector, boot with a MS-DOS system disk and run
   the following command:
<P>
<P><PRE>      fdisk /mbr
</PRE><P>
   WARNING: If your hard drive was prepared by a third-party disk manager
   program, such as Ontrack Disk Manager, then the FDISK /MBR command
   removes the overlay program of that third-party disk manager, such as
   the Overlay Manager, and the drive no longer boots. Therefore, you must
   verify that the drive was not partitioned with a third-party disk
   manager program before using this command.

<LI>Run the Repair utility to verify and recover Windows NT boot files.
<P>
<P>
</UL>FDISK/MBR works only on hard disk drives that are within the limitations
of DOS. If you are accessing devices that are beyond the 1024 cylinder
limit, you will not be able to perform the FDISK/MBR and error code 1762
appears.
<P>
If a virus has infected the MBR, you will not be able to run the Emergency
Repair Disk until the virus is cleaned. Most virus programs have the same
limitation as DOS so you will not be able to run a scan against the hard
disk drive; however, DOS 6.22 MSAV.EXE will clean the Master boot record
and RAM of the machine.
