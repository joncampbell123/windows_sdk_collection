<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you are using CD Player to play audio CDs on a multiple-CD changer,
CD Player seems to stop responding (hang). After 30 to 60 seconds, CD
Player begins responding again.
<P>
In addition, once CD Player has loaded and you are playing a CD,
attempting to access another CD in the changer from within Windows NT
Explorer causes CD Player to display the following message:
<P>
<PRE>   Data or no disk loaded

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
CD Player was not designed for use with multiple-CD changers. The amount
of time it takes CD Player to initialize for a multiple-CD changer is
dependent upon the size of the changer. Because of the information
presented to CD Player when another CD is accessed, CD Player cannot
properly interpret what is being done with the drive.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To have CD Player properly display an audio CD when accessing other CDs,
quit CD Player and restart it.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
For each CD, CD Player views the CD in one of two states: Loaded or
Ejected.  However, with multiple-CD changers, there is a third state:
Unloaded. Unloaded means the CD is in the drive, but not currently under
the CD-ROM drive's read head. CD Player interprets an unloaded CD as an
ejected CD. However, because the CD is not actually ejected, CD Player is
never updated.
