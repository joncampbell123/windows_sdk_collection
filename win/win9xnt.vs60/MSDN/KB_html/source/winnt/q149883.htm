</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Users who have purchased Compaq Prolinea computers with Compaq Business
Audio may have problems installing the Windows Sound System driver or the
Compaq Business Audio driver because of the limited range of I/O
addresses available in the driver configuration dialog box.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Windows Sound System and the Compaq Business Audio are basically the
same driver (Sndsys32.dll). Either of these can be added after Windows NT
is set up by going into Control Panel, Drivers, and clicking the Add
button. Numerous drivers will be listed, including Windows Sound System and
Compaq Business Audio.
<P>
When either of these drivers is added to Windows NT, a dialog box with
configuration options appears. The user can select from among DMA Channel,
I/O Address, and Interrupt. Valid values offered in this dialog box are:
<P>
<PRE>   DMA Channel       I/O Address       Interrupt
   ------------      ------------      ----------
      DMA 0             530            Interrupt 7
      DMA 1             604            Interrupt 9
      DMA 3             E80            Interrupt 10
                        F40            Interrupt 11

</PRE>There is also an Advanced setting for DMA Buffer Size.
<P>
The options for a particular setting may not be available if numerous other
devices--for example, a network card, video adapter, and internal modem--
are installed. To solve this problem, use one of the following two options:

<OL><P><LI>Try to rearrange the DMA, I/O, and Interrupts used by these add-on
   devices (either by changing the jumper/dip switch settings or
   reconfiguring the software, perhaps with a utility such as Intel's
   SoftSet), and then give the Windows or Compaq Audio driver one of the
   newly available settings.
<P>
</OL>OR

<OL><P><LI>Try installing the Creative Labs 1.x Pro 16 driver that comes with
   Windows NT, instead of the Windows Sound System or Compaq Business
   Audio drivers. The Creative Labs driver allows I/O Addresses from 210 to
   280 and Interrupts 2,3,5, and 7. Unlike the Windows or Compaq drivers,
   the Creative Labs driver does not require you to configure the DMA
   channel. After the driver is installed, the system will need to be
   restarted.
<P>
</OL>To verify correct operation of either of the two solutions outlined, check
the System Event Log and look for events related to your audio driver. If
there is a Stop or warning sign next to the entries for your driver, there
may yet be conflicts with Interrupt, I/O Address, or DMA. View the detail
of the event and, if a conflict is indicated, verify all Interrupt, I/O,
and DMA settings (you can use Windows NT Diagnostics, in the Administrative
Tools Group). Change any settings that conflict and restart the system. If
no conflicts are indicated, try connecting speakers to the sound board and
testing some sound files using the Sound Mapper in Control Panel.
