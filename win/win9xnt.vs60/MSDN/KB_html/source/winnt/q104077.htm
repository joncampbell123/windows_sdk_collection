<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you are running 16-bit Windows or MS-DOS applications under
Windows NT, you may receive various error messages when trying to save
a file to an NTFS partition using a long filename. 16-bit applications
are not designed to use filenames greater than the 8.3 characters that
MS-DOS allows. Some 16-bit applications may allow you to save long
filenames, some may give incorrect or misleading error messages and
still save the file as an 8.3-character filename.
<P>
It may be possible to use a long filename with a 16-bit application if
you save the file as an 8.3-character MS-DOS filename and then rename
it with File Manager. However, some applications, such as Write, will
rename the file back to 8.3 characters when it is saved.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
For example, if you try to save a long filename in Word for Windows,
you will receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   This is Not a Valid Filename.

</PRE>Word for Windows will not let you save the file unless an MS-DOS 8.3
filename is used.
<P>
In Write, if you try to save a file as THISFILEHASALONGFILENAME.WRI to
an NTFS partition, you will receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   x:\THISFILEHASALONGFILENAME.WRI
   Cannot Find This File.

   Either Something Has Happened to the Network or Possibly the File
   Has Been Renamed or Moved. Do You Want to Try Again?

</PRE>Once this error message appears, it is not possible to save further
work in Write. However, Write will save the file as an 8.3 filename
with a .WRI extension and the first 8 characters of the name, and once
you exit Write, it is possible to open the 8.3 file.
<P>
With the MS-DOS editor (EDIT.COM), if you save a file with a filename
greater than 8.3 characters, Edit will take the first 11 characters of
the supplied name and use it for the 8.3 filename.
