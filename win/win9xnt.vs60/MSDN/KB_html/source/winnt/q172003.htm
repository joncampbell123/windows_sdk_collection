The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51 and 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In a multiple master domain environment, initiating a change password from
a Macintosh client without specifying the domain name may fail. The error
report to the Macintosh client is:
<P>
<PRE>   Your password could not be changed.
   Please try again or see your server administrator.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Change password requests initiated by a Macintosh client are forwarded to a
computer running Windows NT Server and running Services for Macintosh. The
server then initiates the change password request on behalf of the
Macintosh user. When the user account name is received with no specified
domain name, requests are sent to a list of trusted domain controllers
(DCs) under the multiple master domain model. In this case, an unexpected
error was returned from the change password request because a DC in the
list of trusted DCs was down. Because of the unexpected error, the complete
list of DCs was not processed.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
The workaround is for users to specify the domain [domain_name\username] in
password change requests.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
The Services for Macintosh file, sfmsvc.exe, was modified to handle the
unexpected error code that was encountered.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
