<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Windows NT 4.0 Server and Workstation compact discs include a utility
called Rollback.exe. Rollback.exe was designed to help computer
manufacturers preinstall Windows NT 4.0, and allow end-users to do the
final configuration according to the desired role of the computer. Running
this utility will remove all registry settings on a system and bring it
back to the end of the Character Based Setup portion of the Setup program,
effectively undoing everything configured by the GUI portion of Windows NT
Setup.
<P>
WARNING: Do not run this file on a production system! There is no way to
recover information erased by running this utility, so anything stored
in the registry will be lost. This includes user account information,
protocol bindings, application settings, user preferences, etc.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If you run Rollback.exe on a production system there is no warning that
Rollback.exe removes all system registry entries. Therfore, after you run
Rollback.exe there is no system to rescue or to restore as the registry and
the Setup.log file no longer exist.
<P>
The only fix to this problem is to restore the entire system from a current
tape back up. Emergency Repair Disk does not restore the system as it
requires the Setup.log and specific registry components to be present.
<P>
Rollback.exe is on the Windows NT compact discs in the following directory:
