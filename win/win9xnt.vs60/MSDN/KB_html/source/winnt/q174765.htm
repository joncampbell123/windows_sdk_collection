<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 2 (SP2) or later provides a feature that allows
the Dynamic Host Control Protocol (DHCP) Server Service to respond to BOOTP
requests as well as DHCP requests. There are two types of BOOTP clients:

<UL><LI>BOOTP clients that can request an IP address and other relevant
   information, such as default gateway address, name server address, and
   so on.

<LI>BOOTP clients that can request the location of the boot file information
   from which the client is to boot. This is most common with diskless
   workstations.
<P>
</UL>This article discusses the procedures required to configure a Microsoft
Windows NT DHCP server to provide the requested information to either of
the above BOOTP clients.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
NOTE: The following steps assume that your computer running Microsoft
Windows NT Server already has the DHCP Server Service installed and
correctly configured for DHCP clients.
<P>
<P><h3>BOOTP Clients Requesting IP Address Information Only</h3>
 
<P>
To configure your Microsoft Windows NT DHCP Server to assign IP address
information to BOOTP clients, you must add a reservation for each BOOTP
client. For information about how to add a reservation, view the "Managing
Client Reservations" Help topic in DHCP Manager (Dhcpadmn.exe).
<P>
The reservation builds an association between the media access control
address and the IP address. The clients simply request an address and
Windows NT Server provides the IP address based on the client's media
access control address in the BOOTP request frame. Your scope options apply
to both your DHCP and your BOOTP clients, so it is imperative to verify
that your scopes are configured correctly.
<P>
<P><h3>BOOTP Clients Requesting Boot File Information</h3>
 
<P>
To configure your Microsoft Windows NT DHCP server to provide boot file
information to BOOTP clients, you must edit the BOOTP table in DHCP
Manager. The BOOTP Table is located in the Server Properties dialog box
that can be accessed from the Server menu. For information about how to
edit the BOOTP Table, view the "BOOTP Table" Help topic in DHCP Manager
(Dhcpadmn.exe).
<P>
NOTE: A reservation must be configured in the appropriate scope for each
BOOTP client as specified in the section BOOTP Clients Requesting IP
Address Information Only above.
<P>
The downloading of the image file by the client is performed using Trivial
File Transfer Protocol (TFTP). Microsoft Windows NT does not include a TFTP
Server service. To use your Windows NT DHCP Server with BOOTP clients who
must boot from an image file (usually diskless workstations), a third-party
TFTP server is required.
<P>
For more information on BOOTP see the following articles in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

</PRE><h2>REFERENCES</h2>
 
<P>
For more information about BOOTP, see RFC 1532, RFC 2131, and RFC 2132.
<P>
RFCs may be obtained through the Internet as follows:
<P>
Paper copies of all RFCs are available from the NIC, either individually or
on a subscription basis (for more information, contact NIC@NIC.DDN.MIL).
Online copies are available through FTP or Kermit from NIC.DDN.MIL as
rfc/rfc####.txt or rfc/rfc####.PS (#### is the RFC number without leading
zeros).
<P>
Additionally, RFCs may be requested through electronic mail from the
automated NIC mail server by sending a message to SERVICE@NIC.DDN.MIL with
a subject line of "rfc ####" for text versions, or a subject line of "rfc
####.PS" for PostScript versions. To obtain the RFC index, the subject line
of your message should read "rfc index".
