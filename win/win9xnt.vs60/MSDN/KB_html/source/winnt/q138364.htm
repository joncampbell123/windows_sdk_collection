<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
During the installation of Windows NT, Setup determines the best
partitioning scheme to use based on the existing partition table entries
and where you choose to install Windows NT. Windows NT setup restraints
restrict the boot partition of up to 4GB. The limit may be smaller
depending on disk geometry. The actual value which is used as the limit is
whatever Setup believes to be 1024 cylinders worth of disk space. Sometimes
this is 1GB, 2GB, or 4GB, but can be some other value depending on the
make, model, and configuration of the hard disk adapter in use.

  TITLE     : Boot Partition Created During Setup Limited to 4 Gigabytes

</PRE>This article explains rules you should consider before installing Windows
NT on computers that contain large hardware RAID-5 drive arrays and wish to
use the full contiguous capacity of these large arrays after Windows NT is
installed.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you use a Hardware RAID-5 configuration, it is very important to
understand how Windows NT partitions your drive during Setup in order to
maintain maximum contiguous capacity of the large Array for user data after
Windows NT is installed. Setup follows these rules:
<P>
<P><h3>Rule 1</h3>
 
<P>
If no partitions pre-exist on the drive, Setup makes the primary partition
the size you specify for Windows NT (up to 4GB).
<P>
<P><h3>Rule 2</h3>
 
<P>
If a primary partition already exists, and you choose to install Windows NT
in an unformatted free space, Setup creates and uses an extended partition
(up to 4GB) to install Windows NT in.
<P>
<P><h3>Rule 3</h3>
 
<P>
If a primary partition already exists and you choose to create a new
partition to install Windows NT in, you are prompted for the size of the
partition to create (up to 4GB). After you choose the partition size, Setup
creates the largest extended partition possible (up to 4GB) and creates a
logical drive within the extended partition of the size you choose. After
Windows NT is installed, the unused extended partition space can be used
for additional logical drives.
<P>
<P><h3>Rule 4</h3>
 
<P>
If a primary and extended partition already exist and free space in the
extended partition is selected, Windows NT creates a new logical drive of
the size specified by you.
<P>
<P><h3>Rule 5</h3>
 
<P>
If a primary and extended partition already exist and free space is
available and selected outside of the extended partition, Windows NT
creates another primary partition of the size the you choose (up to 4GB)
for Windows NT to be installed in.
<P>
There are two possible workarounds:

<UL><LI>Prior to installing Windows NT, use MS-DOS FDISK to create an extended
   partition of 250 MB, then create a logical drive of 250 MB within the
   extended partition. When you install Windows NT, select this partition
   as the target to install Windows NT in.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Install Windows NT into the first primary MS-DOS FAT partition. After
   Windows NT is installed, run Disk Administrator and create a second
   primary partition of 250 MB. Re-install Windows NT into this second
   primary partition and then delete the first Windows NT installation from
   the first primary MS-DOS partition.
<P>
</UL><h2>EXAMPLE</h2>
 
<P>
You have four 2 GB drives configured in a hardware RAID-5 configuration for
a total capacity of 6 GB and want a 5.5 GB NTFS partition for user data
after Windows NT is installed. You have MS-DOS pre-installed on a 250MB
primary partition prior to installing Windows NT and want to keep this
intact. You decide to install Windows NT into a separate NTFS partition and
create a 250 MB partition from free space during Windows NT Setup.
<P>
Using Rule 3 above, Windows NT creates an EXTENDED partition of 4 GB, then
create a 250 MB logical drive within to install Windows NT on. After
Windows NT is installed, Disk Administrator shows the following:
<P>
<PRE>   C:   250   MB FAT
   D:   250   MB NTFS (logical drive)
      3.750   GB extended partition space (free)
      1.750   GB Free space
      -----
      6.0     GB total usable space in hardware raid-5 configuration.

</PRE>The problem is that the 2 free spaces cannot be combined to equal the 5.5
GB partition space wanted for user data.
