<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Trantor 128 and 130B are 8 bit SCSI host adapter cards for the IBM
PC/XT/AT and 80386/80486 computers. These host adapters have both internal
and external connectors. The host adapters support I/O-mapped data transfer
at any of one of four addresses (plus disable), zero-wait state operation
for high-speed performance, and Boot ROM option.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The product included here is manufactured by Trantor Systems, Ltd., a
vendor independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise,
regarding this product's performance or reliability.
<P>
Both the T128 and T130B have internal 50-pin and external 25-pin SCSI
connectors. The internal SCSI connection is marked with a silk-screened "1"
on the board adjacent to Pin 1. Both the Trantor T128 and T130B come with
an optional Boot ROM, which may or may not have the ROM chip in the socket.
<P>
Switch &amp; Jumper Settings:
<P>
The switches and jumpers set the card address, ROM address, DMA channel,
interrupt channel and other functions. The internal SCSI connector is
located at the top end of the card, and the switches are located in one of
the two following locations:

<UL><LI>Below the connector, on the T128 host adapter
<P>
   -or-

<LI>To the left of the connector, on the T130B host adapter.
<P>
</UL>The default position for all switches on the T128 and T130B is OFF.
<P>

Summary of Switch Settings:
<P>
<PRE>  Switch   Function     Setting
  --------------------------------------------------------
  SW 1,2,3, &amp; 4 Reserved     OFF at all times
  SW 5   Boot ROM Enable   ON:enabled;OFF:disabled
  SW 6   Zero Wait-State Operation ON:enabled;OFF:disabled
  SW 7 &amp; 8  Memory Address    see below

</PRE>Memory Address:
<P>
The T128 adapter works with one of four memory-mapped addresses. Switches 7
and 8 select this address. The T128 adapter uses a single 8K address
register beginning at the address selected by the switches.
<P>
<PRE>   Memory Address   Sw7   Sw8
   --------------------------
   CC00h            OFF   OFF
   C800h            OFF   ON
   DC00h            ON    OFF
   D800h            ON    ON

</PRE>The Switches 1-4 should remain OFF. Switch 5 enables the Boot ROM to permit
booting from a device set to SCSI address 0. The Zero Wait-State can be
enabled on AT-class or faster computers. This permits significantly faster
operation of SCSI hard disks. "Zero Wait-State" refers not to memory, but
to the speed of the bus itself. This switch should not be enabled until
after the devices have been installed and tested thoroughly. Memory address
of many 16-bit VGA cards may conflict with the default setting of CC00h. Be
sure to consult the display adapter manual.
<P>
One additional Jumper, JP1, located at the bottom near the adapter slot, is
used for optional interrupt selection. If interrupts are selected in the
software then the jumpers must be installed. Interrupts 3, 5, or 7 are
available. There are 12 pins on JP1, and one jumper is needed. The
following shows the settings.
<P>
<PRE>   Interrupt    Jumper Block JP1

   IRQ3     '--' ' ' ' ' pin12

       pin1 ' ' ' ' ' '

   IRQ5     ' ' ' ' ' ' pin12

  SW 7 &amp; 8    Reserved            OFF at all times

</PRE>I/O Address:
<P>
The T130B adapter works at one of four I/O addresses. The T130B adapter
uses a single 8K address register beginning at the address selected by the
switches. Switches 1 and 2 select this address.
<P>

</PRE>Memory ROM Address:
<P>
The T130B adapter works with one of four memory-mapped addresses. Switches
3 and 4 select this address. The T130B adapter uses a single 8K address
register beginning at the address selected by the switches.

</PRE>Switch 6 enables the Boot ROM to permit booting from a device set to either
SCSI address 0, 1 or 2. The Zero Wait-State can be enabled on AT-class or
faster computers. This permits significantly faster operation of SCSI hard-
disks. "Zero Wait-State" refers not to memory, but to the speed of the bus
itself. This switch should not be enabled until after the devices have been
installed and tested thoroughly. One additional Jumper, JP3, located at the
bottom near the adapter slot, is used for optional interrupt selection. If
interrupts are selected in the software then the jumpers must be installed.
Interrupts 3, 5, or 7 or no IRQ are available. There are 6 pins on JP3, and
one jumper is needed. The following shows the settings.
<P>
<PRE>   Interrupt    Jumper Block JP3

   IRQ3     ' ' ' pin6

       pin1 ' ' '
