<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
While running a Compaq ProLiant using the NetFlex-3 network adapter, all
network connectivity is intermittently lost.
<P>
-or-
<P>
When checking the properties of the NetFlex-3 adapter, a "Wire Fault"
error is received.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
These errors may occur if you are using a NetFlex-3 card with the 100 UTP
module attached, and the following is true:
<P>
The module is set at 100 megabits per second and the first device
encountered, such as a hub, can only handle 10 megabits per second, or if
the module is defective and not properly autodetecting the inability of
that first device to handle the 100 megabits per second speed.
<P>
-or-
<P>
It may be a Token Ring module being used on Ethernet, or the other way
around. However, this could only apply if the computer were brand new, or
just had service work such as replacing the motherboard. If the computer
had been operating properly, the cause would probably be the above choice.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, do one of the following:

<UL><LI>Obtain the updated driver for the NetFlex-3 PCI card in Softpack SP3206
   from Compaq

<LI>Remove the module, which is located on the motherboard, plugged into
   the top of the NetFlex-3. Restart the computer.  This will allow the
   computer to revert to its default setting of 10 megabits per second.
   After the computer restarts, network connectivity should be restored.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may occur if the computer uses the NetFlex-3 card with a
100 UTP module attached on an Ethernet network. By default, this module is
set to autodetect between 10 megabits per second and 100 megabits per
second. With the autodetect setting, the module is supposed to attempt to
send at 100 megabits per second, and, if the first device encountered (for
example, a hub) cannot handle that speed, it will then revert to sending
at 10 megabits per second.
<P>
Pinging the adapter may be successful, and Compaq diagnostic utilities may
still show a successful connection with the hub.
<P>
Reinstalling the NetFlex-3 will show light activity at the hub, but still
no network connectivity. If the computer is then restarted, all hub light
activity will cease.
<P>
The "Wire Frame" error is a Token Ring error, even though this may be an
Ethernet card. If the network wire is plugged into another computer, it
works fine.
<P>
The 100 UTP module is set to autodetect by default on an Ethernet network.
To set this to either 100 megabits per second or 10 megabits per second
only, you must configure through CMOS.
<P>
For a Token Ring module, the settings must be configured in CMOS for the
4/16 speeds.
