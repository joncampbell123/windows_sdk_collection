The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5 and 3.51
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If your computer running Windows NT Server and the Dynamic Host
Configuration Protocol (DHCP) offers and reserves an IP address for a DHCP
client, and the client takes a DHCP offer from another DHCP server, the
DHCP server does not return the offered IP address to the pool of available
addresses for 15 minutes.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following events occur when a DHCP client requests an IP address when
multiple DHCP servers are on the network:

<OL><P><LI>When a DHCP client boots, it broadcasts a DHCPDISCOVER message to the
   network.

<P><LI>All DHCP servers in that network receive the DHCPDISCOVER message and
   they in turn send their DHCPOFFER messages via broadcast.

<P><LI>When a DHCP server sends a DHCPOFFER message, offering an IP address,
   the DHCP server reserves that IP address so that it cannot be offered to
   another DHCP client.

<P><LI>When the DHCP client accepts an IP address, the DHCP server that
   offered that address marks that address as being leased and the other
   DHCP servers return the offered IP addresses to the pool of available
   addresses, however, with a 15 minute delay.  The address should be
   returned to the available pool of  addresses as soon as  the DHCP client
   requests an address from another DHPC server.
<P>
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.5 and
3.51. This problem was corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Windows NT Workstation or Server version 3.51. For information on obtaining
