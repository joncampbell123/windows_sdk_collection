<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0
</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Under Windows NT 3.5x and 4.0, it is possible to disable the Printing
Notification network dialog boxes sent by the spooler on a print server
when a print job has been completed, there is an error, or a job has been
deleted.
<P>
NOTE: This option is not available in Windows NT or Windows NT Advanced
Server version 3.1. Also note that this setting applies globally to all The
printers on a particular print server. It is not possible to set this
option on a per-printer basis.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Use the following steps to disable Printing Notification network dialog
boxes:
<P>
NOTE: This option must be performed on the server that is sending the pop-
up. The only way to disable a pop-up on a client is to disable the
messenger service on the client.  Disabling the pop-up from the server will
affect all clients.

<P><h3>Windows NT 3.51</h3>

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them.
Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of
Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

<OL><P><LI>Start Registry Editor.

<P><LI>From the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following subkey:
<P>
       SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print\Providers

<P><LI>From the Edit menu, click Add Value.

<P><LI>In the Value Name field of the Add Value dialog box, type the
    following:
<P>
       NetPopup

<P><LI>Select REG_DWORD for the Data Type.

<P><LI>Click OK.

<P><LI>In the Dword Editor dialog box, type 0 (zero) in the Data field.

<P><LI>Click OK.

<P><LI>Exit Registry Editor.

<P><LI>Exit Print Manager if it is running, and then stop and restart the
    Spooler service from the Services portion of Control Panel so the new
    setting will take effect.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: Under Windows NT versions 3.51 and 4.0, if the print notification is
turned off and the printer is directly connected by means of a parallel or
serial cable, error messages will appear on the server. While the error is
displayed, printing will not resume to the printer, even if the cause of
the error is cleared from the printer. Someone must log on to the server
and click Retry or Cancel in the Error Message dialog box. This does not
effect network-connected printers.
<P>
<P><h3>Windows NT 4.0</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Printers.

<P><LI>From the File menu, click Server Properties.

<P><LI>On the Advance tab, click "Notify when Remote Documents are Printed" so
   that it is not selected.

<P><LI>Stop and restart the Spooler service from the Services portion of
   Control Panel so the new setting will take effect.
