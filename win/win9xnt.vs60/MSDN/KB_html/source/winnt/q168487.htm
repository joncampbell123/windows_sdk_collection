SYMPTOMS
 
<P>
Thirty minutes to an hour after your Windows NT server computer is started,
clients start to have connectivity problems with the server. When accessing
resources they may receive the error:
<P>
<PRE>   The remote computer is not available.

</PRE>-OR-
<P>
Clicking on the server in Network Neighborhood may give the error:
<P>
<PRE>   remote computer is not accessible.

</PRE>Restarting the server temporarily resolves the problem, but it occurs
again.
<P>
You can still ping the server by name and/or TCP/IP address.
<P>
After disabling the Quota Advisor services in Control Panel/Services, the
errors still occur.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>

in Control Panel/Devices that also needs to be disabled. Uninstalling the
software with the Uninstall program may not completely remove the software.
