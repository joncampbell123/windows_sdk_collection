<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In the current implementation of the Microsoft dynamic host configuration
protocol (DHCP) service, if a device is provided with an Internet Provider
(IP) configuration by way of DHCP, we do a courtesy Address Resolution
Protocol (ARP) with the provided IP address. If anyone responds, that means
the address is in use. In this case, when a duplicate IP is detected as the
TCP/IP protocol tries to initialize, a popup message is provided to the
user stating that a duplicate IP address exists. The user is informed to
get system administration assistance. At that point, the TCP/IP protocol
initialization is failed and the user can't access any network resources.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
DHCP RFC 1541 permits that instead of informing the user, initiating a
manual process, a DHCP_DECLINE transaction can be returned to the DHCP
server. The server will then allocate a different IP address for the
device.
<P>
DHCP RFC 1541 indicates that it is the responsibility of the DHCP client
to notify the DHCP server with a DHCP_DECLINE transaction if the client
determines that there is a problem with the DHCP parameters provided by the
DHCP Server.
<P>
The RFC states:
<P>
3.1 Client-server interaction - allocating a network address:
<P>
<PRE>   The client receives the DHCPACK message with configuration parameters.
   The client performs a final check on the parameters and notes the
   duration of the lease and of the lease identification cookie specified
   in the DHCPACK message. At this point, the client is configured. If the
   client detects a problem with the parameters in the DHCPACK message, the
   client sends a DHCPDECLINE message to the server and restarts the
   configuration process. The client should wait a minimum of ten seconds
   before restarting the configuration process to avoid excessive network
   traffic in case of looping.

</PRE>4.3.3 DHCPDECLINE message:
<P>
<PRE>   If the server receives a DHCPDECLINE message, the client has discovered
   through some other means that the suggested network address is already
   in use. The server MUST mark the network address as "not allocated" and
   SHOULD notify the local system administrator of a possible configuration
   problem.

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0.
This problem was corrected in the latest US Service Pack for Windows NT.
