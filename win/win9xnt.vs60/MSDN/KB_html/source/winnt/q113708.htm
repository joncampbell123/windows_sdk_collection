</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Net2Com enables MS-DOS or Microsoft Windows clients to use modems attached
to a Windows NT server for outbound modem services. You can use the Windows
NT communications tool, WINVTP.EXE, with Net2Com. Windows NT clients can
also be used, but only via Windows or MS-DOS-based terminal emulation
products such as DynaComm (from Futuresoft).
<P>
NOTE: You cannot use Windows Terminal with Net2Com. Net2Com only works with
software that communicates directly with NetBIOS. Installing Net2Com is a
separate task from installing the Resource Kit tools.
<P>
<P><h3>To Install Net2Com</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start Command Prompt.
</OL>2. Create a directory for Net2Com by typing:
<P>
<PRE>      md c:\test

</PRE><P><LI>Copy TECHNE.ZIP to  C:\TEST.
</OL>4. Use a utility to extract the Net2Com files from TECHNE.ZIP.
5. Run the NET2SET command.
6. Follow the provided directions.
<P>
The Net2Com setup program installs all the necessary files in the directory
you specify (typically SYSTEM32\NET2COM).
<P>
<P><h3>To Start the Net2Com Service on a Windows NT Server</h3>
 
<P>
From the Services portion of Control Panel, select Net2Com and choose
Start, or, from Command Prompt, type the following:
<P>
<PRE>   net start net2com

</PRE></OL><h3>To Remove Net2Com</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Stop the Net2Com service from the Services portion of Control Panel.
</OL>2. In File Manager, run NET2SET.EXE.
3. Choose the Remove button.
<P>
<P><h3>Registry Values for Net2Com</h3>
 
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them.
Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of
Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.
<P>
The following two Registry values can be set using Registry Editor to
configure Net2Com:
<P>
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Net2Com\ComMechDLL
<P>
Value: COM
<P>
This is a multiple-line value. The fifth line tells Net2Com the
communications port to use by default. If this line is not present, COM2 is
used.
<P>
Value: NetBIOS
<P>
This is a multiple-line value. The fifth line tells Net2Com the NetBIOS
name to use by default. The NetBIOS name is used by the client software to
establish a connection to this Net2Com server. By default, this value is
LIONHEART. The value can be any combination of letters and numbers (but
must start with a letter) and be 15 characters or less.
<P>
<P><h3>Files Required for Net2Com</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   NCB2PTH.DLL
   NET2ALL.DLL
   NET2COM.EXE
   NET2COM.INF
   NET2MST.DLL
   NET2PSP.DLL
   NET2SET.EXE (setup program)
   PTH2COM.DLL
