<P>
If you attempt to integrate NT into a preexisting Novell network, Novell
requires that one of it s servers act as seed routers. The function of
Novell seed routers is much different from the function of seed routers
familiar to Windows NT users. The initial difference is the Zone Range.
A legal Novell zone range would be 1000-1000. This would also be a legal
range for Windows NT. This would preclude anyone from getting into this
zone range since it has a length of zero. However, Novell allows an
indeterminate number of members in that zone since additions are demand
driven rather than hard coded. Zones can be added from any Novell server
and are not based on a single seed router (as it would be on a hardware
based or Windows NT-based router). A Windows NT machine will not be able to
generate its own zone but will be able to insert itself into one of the
existing Novell zones.
