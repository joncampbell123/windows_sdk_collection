<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run Windows NT Mail (MSMAIL32.EXE) and attempt to open an attached
file that has spaces in the file name, the following error message appears:
<P>
<PRE>   The application for the attached file '&lt;file name.ext&gt;'
   (or one of its components) could not be found.

</PRE><h3>TO REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create a file name with spaces in the name, for example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      "This is a small file.txt"
</PRE><P>
   but without the quotation marks.

<P><LI>Create a second file, with a long file name, but without spaces in the
   name, for example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Thisismylongfilename.txt
</PRE>
<P><LI>Start the Windows NT Mail client, create a new message and choose
   Attach. Change to the directory that contains the two files
   created.
<P>
   NOTE: The full file name appears in the dialog box!

<P><LI>Select both files and choose Attach.
<P>
   Both files are attached to the message, and the correct names appear.

<P><LI>Try to doubleclick the file with spaces in the name ("This is a small
   file.txt").
<P>
   The following error message appears:
<P>
<P><PRE>      No application is associated with...
</PRE>
<P><LI>Try to doubleclick the file without spaces in the name
   (Thisismylongfilename.txt).
<P>
   This works correctly.
<P>
</OL>The same symptom occurs if you choose Save Attachment from the File menu.
The dialog box offers the whole file name of the attached file but it does
not offer the option to save the attached file with this name.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When you doubleclick on the file attachments, Windows NT saves them in the
following manner to TEMP directory:
<P>
<PRE>   Original File Name            File Name Saved by Windows NT
   -----------------------------------------------------------
   This is a small file.txt      thisisas
   Thisismylongfilename.txt      thisismy.txt

</PRE></OL>The "thisisas" file name does not have a *.txt extension and therefore the
error message above appears.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, save the attached file to a local drive and
then open it.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.1, 3.5
and 3.51. A fix to this problem is in development, but has not been
regression-tested and may be destabilizing in production environments.
Microsoft does not recommend implementing this fix at this time. Contact
Microsoft Product Support Services for more information on the availability
of this fix.
