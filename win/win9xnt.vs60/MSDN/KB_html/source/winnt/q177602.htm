The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51 and 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51 and 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
This information applies to a computer running Windows NT Workstation with
Client Services for NetWare (CSNW) installed and to a computer running
Windows NT Server with Gateway Services for NetWare (GSNW) installed.
<P>
When using a NET USE command to connect to a NetWare resource, the time it
takes to connect is notably longer than when using NET USE to connect to a
Microsoft resource.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
In Windows NT 3.51, the network provider search order is controlled by
options set using the Networks button in the Network tool of Control Panel.
In Windows NT 4.0, it is controlled by using the Network Access Order
button found on the Services tab of the Network tool in Control Panel.
These buttons are unavailable unless CSNW or GSNW are installed. If the
Network Access order has Microsoft Windows Network listed as the highest
priority under Network Providers, the delay in connecting to NetWare
resources will occur.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
With both the Microsoft and NetWare (CSNW/GSNW) redirectors installed and
with Microsoft networks having priority, Windows NT will attempt to resolve
any machine name specified with NET USE through whatever NetBIOS name
resolution methods available. These methods can include NetBIOS broadcast
for NetBEUI and NWLink, and a multitude of methods for TCP/IP, including
NetBIOS name cache, WINS, b-node broadcast, LMHOSTS file, HOSTS file, and
DNS. Only after these methods fail will the NET USE command be passed from
the Microsoft redirector to the NetWare redirector. After the NetWare
redirector receives the command, name resolution is very quick through a
SAP query.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this issue, change the network provider access order such that
the NetWare or Compatible Network is highest on the list. With this change,
all NET USE commands will be passed first to the NetWare redirector for
name resolution. This change may also be better for situations where File
Manager or Explorer is used more often than NET USE. However, this change
is not desirable in many cases.
<P>
An alternate syntax for the NET USE command exists that is invalid for use
with Microsoft resources but is valid for use with CSNW or GSNW. Use of
this syntax will cause the Microsoft redirector to instantly pass the
command to the NetWare redirector. The following standard command is valid
for Microsoft or NetWare resources:
<P>
<PRE>   NET USE X: \\SERVER\RESOURCE

</PRE>Where X: is the desired drive letter to use (or * for the next available
drive letter), SERVER is the name of the Microsoft or NetWare server, and
RESOURCE is the Microsoft share or NetWare volume.
<P>
For faster results when connecting to a NetWare resource, use the following
syntax:
<P>
<PRE>   NET USE X: SERVER\RESOURCE:

</PRE>Where X: (or *) is the drive letter to use, SERVER is the name of the
NetWare server, and RESOURCE: is the name of the NetWare volume. This
syntax will be rejected by the Microsoft redirector and passed directly to
the NetWare redirector. The command will complete much more quickly,
reducing both the time to connect and network traffic generated to complete
the command.
