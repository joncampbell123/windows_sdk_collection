<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Consistency checking was added to the Windows Internet Name Service (WINS)
server in Windows NT 4.0 to aid in maintaining database integrity among
WINS servers in a large network.
<P>
When consistency checking is enabled on a WINS server, the server pulls all
of the records directly from each owner server in its database, which
includes servers that the WINS server has records from that are not among
its replication partners.
<P>
NOTE: If a WINS database is extremely large, the consistency checking
process may be network intensive.
<P>
All records are compared from the local and remote databases.

<UL><LI>If the record in the local database is identical to the record pulled
   from the owner database, its timestamp is updated.

<LI>If the record in the local database has a lower version ID than the
   record pulled from the owner database, the pulled record is added to the
   local database and the original local record is marked for deletion.

<LI>If the records have the same version ID but a different name, the local
   record will be marked deleted and the pulled record will replace it.
<P>
</UL>Consistency checking is enabled through registry changes. It can also be
triggered using the WINSCL utility available as part of the Windows NT 4.0
Server Resource Kit.
