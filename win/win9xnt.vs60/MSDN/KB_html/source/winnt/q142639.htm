<P>
</UL><h2>Microsoft Peer Web Services</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Installing Peer Web Services on Windows NT Workstation Version 4.0</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft Peer Web services is a personal Web server that has been
optimized to run on Windows NT Workstation version 4.0. With Peer Web
Services, you can create a personal Internet server, which is ideal for
development, testing, and peer-to-peer publishing. As with Internet
Information Server, Peer Web Services supports all ISAPI extensions and
filters.  For more information about Internet Information Server, see
"Microsoft Internet Information Server" later in this document.
<P>
After you have you installed Windows NT Workstation, you can install Peer
Web Services using the Network icon in Control Panel. If you already have
the necessary Internet or intranet connection, you can accept all of the
default settings during Setup and then add your Hypertext Markup Language
(HTML) content files to the \Wwwroot directory. Your files will be
immediately available to users. The default Setup configurations are
suitable for many publishing scenarios without further modifications.
<P>
<P><h3>To install Peer Web Services</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Insert the Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 compact disc into the CD-
   ROM drive.
</OL>2. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.
3. Double-click the Network icon and then click the Services tab.
4. Click Add.
5. From the list of services, select Microsoft Peer Web Services, and then
<PRE>   click OK.
</PRE></OL>6. Type the drive letter for the compact disc.
7. Follow the instructions on the screen.
<P>
For help with any Setup dialog box, click the Help button.
<P>
For more information about installation, see the Start Here book provided
with Windows NT Workstation version 4.0.
<P>
<P><h3>Where Is the Product Documentation?</h3>
 
<P>
Documentation for Microsoft Peer Web Services is installed with the product
and is available online. After installing the product, you can open its
Installation And Administration Guide by clicking the Product Documentation
icon in the Microsoft Internet Server program group, or by running Internet
Service Manager and clicking Topics on the Help menu. You can also review
the product documentation before you install Peer Web Services by using a
Web browser (such as Microsoft Internet Explorer) to open the files
directly from the Windows NT Workstation compact disc.
<P>
To read the documentation, open the following file on the compact disc:
<P>
<PRE>   \&lt;platform&gt;\Inetsrv\Htmldocs\Inetdocs.htm

</PRE>where &lt;platform&gt; is Alpha, I386, Mips, or Ppc.
<P>
You must have a Web browser (such as Microsoft Internet Explorer) to view
this documentation. You can print chapters by using your Internet browser's
Print command. You will obtain the best printing results by using your
browser's default font size for text; for example, Medium in Internet
Explorer and 12 points in Netscape Navigator.
<P>
Information about Peer Web Services is included in the Start Here book
provided with Windows NT Workstation version 4.0.
<P>
<P><h3>Removing TCP/IP</h3>
 
<P>
If you remove the TCP/IP protocol, Peer Web Services cannot be removed by
using the Peer Web Services Setup icon  To work around the problem and
remove Peer Web services, reinstall the TCP/IP protocol, and then remove
Peer Web Services.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Support for Private Communication Technology (PCT)</h3>
 
<P>
Peer Web Services supports the PCT 2.0 specification, which is designed to
secure general-purpose business and personal communications on the Internet
and includes features such as privacy, authentication, and mutual
identification. PCT enhances Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) with technology
developed for Secure Transaction Technology (STT), particularly in
authentication and protocol efficiency. By separating authentication from
encryption, PCT enables applications to use authentication that is
significantly stronger than the 40-bit key limit for encryption allowed by
the U.S. government for export. Microsoft's implementation of PCT is
backward compatible with SSL.
<P>
<P><h3>Changes to User Configuration</h3>
 
<P>
If changes to user configurations (such as adding or removing users from a
group, changing passwords, or changing NTFS permissions) do not take affect
immediately, try stopping and restarting the Internet services (WWW, FTP,
and gopher). Peer Web Services caches security tokens for all users.
Changes to user configurations will not appear until the security-token
cache is cleared and the new tokens are cached.  The default caching
interval is 15 minutes.
<P>
<P><h3>Product Home Page</h3>
 
<P>
The HTML samples include a product home page (Default.htm) for Peer Web
Services that contains links to the product documentation, the Web-based
server administration tool, and to the Microsoft Web site.
<P>
If you already have a file named Default.htm in the Wwwroot directory, the
setup program will not replace your file with the product's default home
page. You can view the product home page by typing the following URL:
<P>
<PRE>     <B>http://&lt;computername&gt;/Samples/Default.htm</B>

</PRE>If you do not have a file named Default.htm in the Wwwroot directory, Setup
copies the file to the Wwwroot directory.
<P>
<P><h3>Publishing from Network Drives</h3>
 
<P>
The FTP, gopher, and WWW services cannot publish from redirected network
drives (that is, from drive letters assigned to network shared folders).
<P>
To use network drives, you must use the server and share name (for example,
\\&lt;Computername&gt;\&lt;Sharename&gt;\Wwwfiles). If you require a user name and
password to connect to a network drive, all requests from remote users to
access that drive must be made with the user name and password you
specified, not the anonymous IUSR_&lt;computername&gt; account or another account
you may have specified.
<P>
<P><h3>Choosing a Logon Method</h3>
 
<P>
This release of Peer Web Services provides three logon methods for the WWW,
FTP, and gopher services.

<UL><LI>"Local" means that the user is logged on as though he or she had
   actually walked up to the computer and logged on interactively. The user
   must have the Log On Locally access right set in User Manager.

<LI>"Batch" means the user is logged on locally (as with the Local logon
   method) but must have the Log On As A Batch Job access right set in User
   Manager. This logon method enables the user to access the server from a
   Web browser but does not give the user the right to log on locally.

<LI>"Network" means the user is logged on as a remote network user. The user
   must have the Access This Computer From Network access right set in User
   Manager. This logon method enables the user to access the server from a
   Web browser but does not give the user the right to log on locally.
   Users logged on with this logon method cannot access remote,
   authenticated resources, such as a SQL server using integrated security.
<P>
</UL>Generally, you should configure the default logon method for FTP and gopher
users as Network. You should configure the default logon for WWW service
users as Network unless users need to access remote, authenticated
resources.
<P>
The default logon method is Local. To change the logon method, set the
registry entry LogonMethod as described in Chapter 10, "Configuring
Registry Entries," in "Internet Information Server Installation and
Administration Guide".
<P>
For the WWW service, if the user's browser supports Basic authentication,
the user is logged on using the logon method set in the LogonMethod
registry entry. If the user's browser supports Windows NT
Challenge/Response authentication, the user is always logged on using the
Network logon method.
<P>
Note that Basic authentication sends user names and passwords over the
network in clear text (unencrypted text). Challenge/Response authentication
is more secure because it sends passwords in encrypted text. Currently,
only Internet Explorer 2.0 or later supports Windows NT Challenge/Response
authentication. For more information on security, see Chapter 5, "Securing
Your Site Against Intruders," in the "Peer Web Services Installation and
Administration Guide".
<P>
<P><h3>Setting the Log File Size</h3>
 
<P>
You cannot set the maximum size of the logging file by using the Web-based
version of Internet Service Manager.  You must use Internet Service Manager
to set this option, which is located in the Logging Properties panel.
<P>
<P><h3>Internet Information Server Setup May Be Disabled After Installing ODBC 3.0</h3>
 
<P>
If you installed Internet Information Server 2.0 and start the Internet
Information Server 2.0 setup program from the start menu item, it may
display a message which says that the SqlInstallODBC entry point is
missing.  To work around this problem, run the IIS setup program again. The
program must be run from platform\inetsrv\inetstp.exe on the Windows NT
compact disc.
<P>
<P><h3>To run inetstp.exe for Peer Web Services</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Insert the Windows NT Workstation compact disc in the drive.
</OL>2. Type d: and then press ENTER.
3. Type cd \&lt;platform&gt;\inetsrv and then press ENTER.
4. Type inetstp.exe and then press ENTER.
<P>
<P><h3>Peer Web Services Default File is Changed to Default.htm</h3>
 
<P>
Upon installation of Peer Web Services, the Default Document for the WWW
Service will be set to Default.htm.  If you previously had a different
default document, you need to change it in the Microsoft Internet Service
Manager.  Go to the start menu and click on Programs/Peer Web
Services/Internet Service Manager.  This will start the Microsoft Internet
Service Manager.  Double click on the WWW line in the display.  Click on
the Directories tab and edit the Default Document edit box.  Click OK.
<P>
<P><h3>FAQ and Mailing List for IIS Developers</h3>
 
<P>
Stephen Genusa's IIS FAQ answers questions about Internet Information
Server and is a good source of additional information about developing
applications for IIS. To read the FAQ, visit

<P>
<P><h3>Using Windows Messaging with Microsoft Mail</h3>
 
<P>
Windows Messaging is designed to replace the Microsoft Mail program that
comes with Windows NT and Microsoft Mail version 3.x. After installing
Windows Messaging, you will no longer be able to run the older Microsoft
mail program, but you will be able to use Windows Messaging to send and
receive messages.
<P>
<P><h3>Using Windows Messaging with Microsoft Mail and Remote Access Service (RAS)</h3>
 
<P>
Before configuring the Microsoft Mail Service for remote usage, you need to
install the Remote Access Service (RAS) and create a RAS phonebook entry by
using the Dial-Up Networking icon. If a RAS phonebook entry has not been
created, the remote configuration tabs (Remote Configuration, Remote
Session, &amp; Dial-Up Networking) will not be available when configuring the
Microsoft Mail Service in Windows Messaging.
<P>
RAS can be installed during Windows NT Setup or from the Services tab in
the Network icon in Control Panel. The Dial-Up Networking icon is found
either on the desktop in My Computer or on the Start menu under
Programs/Accesories.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Internet Mail &amp; MIME Handling</h3>
 
<P>
This version of Windows NT does not support MIME mappings to filename
extensions if Internet Explorer is not installed. Messages (containing
attachments) sent in MIME format will be sent as application/octet-stream
rather than specific MIME types. A filename will be included on outbound
messages.
<P>
<P><h2>Printers Folder</h2>
 
<P>
Printers are now set up and accessed from the new Printers folder.
<P>
To view the Printers folder, click Start, point to Settings, then click
Printers.
<P>
To add a new printer, in the Printers folder, click the Add Printer wizard.
<P>
<P><h2>Finding Files</h2>
 
<P>

<UL><LI>To find files on your computer, open the My Computer icon on your
   desktop.
<LI>To find a specific file, click the Start menu, point to Find, then click
   Files or Folders.
<LI>On the Start menu, point to Programs, then click Windows NT Explorer.
<P>
</UL><h2>3D Pinball</h2>
 
<P>
3D Pinball for Windows NT, a high-tech version of the classic arcade game,
provides state-of-the-art graphics and sound. For information about how to
use this game, click the Help menu in 3D Pinball. 3D Pinball is

</PRE></OL><h2>AutoRun</h2>
 
<P>
AutoRun allows music and computer compact discs to start automatically
after they are inserted in the drive.
<P>
For this release, AutoRun is enabled by default. To disable AutoRun, set
the following key in the registry:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\CdRom\Autorun,
   REG_DWORD == 0x0

</PRE>When the CD Player accessory is running, other files on the compact disc
cannot be accessed. CD Player will return the message "Device Busy".
<P>
NOTE: If you disabled AutoRun under Windows NT version 4.0 Beta 1 or Beta 2
and upgrade to the final version of Windows NT version 4.0, it will remain
disabled.
<P>
<P><h2>Windows NT version 4.0 NTFS Compatibility with Windows NT version 3.51 NTFS</h2>
 
<P>
The Windows NT File System (NTFS) file system supports clusters up to 64K.
However, the file record size is always 1K regardless of the cluster size.
The File Allocation Table (FAT) file system supports clusters up to 256K.
<P>
Due to the cluster size change, formatting a volume with 2K or larger
clusters with NTFS can generate a volume that is not usable by Windows NT
version 3.51. File record sizes that are smaller than the cluster size is
not supported by Windows NT version 3.51. However, you can ensure backwards
compatibility by running format from the command line and specifying the /a
parameter. This parameter is used to override the default disk allocation
unit size.
<P>
Default settings are strongly recommended for general use.
NTFS supports 512 bytes, 1K, 2K, 4K, 8K, 16K, 32K, 64K.
FAT supports 8K, 16K, 32K, 64K, 128K, 256K.
NTFS compression is not supported for allocation unit sizes above 4K.
<P>
<P><h2>486 Emulator</h2>
 
<P>
The 486 emulator allows RISC-based systems to run Windows-based and MS-DOS®
applications that require 386 enhanced mode support or look for a 486
processor. For example, the 486 Emulator allows you to now use Visual Basic
4.0 on RISC-based hardware platforms, such as the Digital Alpha.
<P>
<P><h2>Hardware Profiles</h2>
 
<P>
Before you can work with a hardware profile, you must set it up and
activate it.
<P>
<P><h3>Setting Up a Hardware Profile</h3>
 
<P>
There are two ways to access the Hardware Profiles icon. You can use either
My Computer or the Control Panel.
<P>
Using My Computer:
Using the right mouse button, click My Computer, then select Properties.
<P>
Using Control Panel:
1. On the Start menu, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.
2. Double-click the System icon.
3. Click the Hardware Profiles tab.
4. The Available Hardware Profiles box displays existing hardware profiles.
<P>
One hardware profile is listed. This profile was created automatically when
you installed Windows NT.
<P>
To create a new profile, click Copy and type a new hardware profile name.
<P>
The order of your hardware profiles in the listbox is important because it
determines a default order at startup. You can use the up and down arrow
buttons to place the hardware profile that you would like as a default at
the top of the list.
<P>
<P><h3>Activating a Hardware Profile</h3>
 
<P>
Select a configuration from a list that appears at startup. Startup will
not continue until you have selected a hardware profile.
<P>
You can have your computer activate one hardware profile by default when
you start your computer. From the Hardware Profiles box, enter 0 as the
timeout value. If you decide later to select a different hardware profile,
press the spacebar at startup and choose a hardware profile from your list.
<P>
You can specify an amount of time that you would like your computer to wait
before defaulting to the first selection on your highest-order preference.
During the waiting period, you can use the cursor keys to select an
alternate profile.
<P>
<P><h3>Hardware Profiles and Boot Devices</h3>
 
<P>
When using hardware profiles, be careful not to disable one of your boot
devices. If you disable a required boot device, Windows NT might not start.
Microsoft recommends that you make a copy of your default profile and then
make changes to the new profile so you can restore the default profile if
something unexpected occurs.
<P>
<P><h2>NDS-Aware Client/Gateway Services for NetWare</h2>
 
<P>
The Windows NT version 4.0 includes an NDS-aware version of the Microsoft
Windows NT Client/Gateway Services for NetWare (CSNW/GSNW).
<P>
This version enables users running the Windows NT platform to access
Novell® NetWare® 4.x servers running NetWare Directory Services (NDS). With
NDS, shared objects on participating NetWare servers are organized into a
hierarchical tree.
<P>
This updated version of Client/Gateway Services for NetWare includes all
the functionality of previous versions, in addition to NDS compatibility.
<P>
<P><h3>Creating Print Gateways to Print Queues on NDS Servers</h3>
 
<P>
When you create a print gateway to a print queue on an NDS-authenticated
server, you must also create a file gateway from the gateway server to a
file share on the same NDS-authenticated server for the print gateway to
work.
<P>
<P><h3>Using the Dir Command on NDS Trees</h3>
 
<P>
To use the dir command to see the directory contents of a remote NDS
directory, put the directory path in quote marks.  For example, the
following command works successfully:
<P>
dir "\\nds-tree\cn=volume.ou=unit.o=group"
<P>
<P><h3>Creating a Gateway to an NDS Volume</h3>
 
<P>
To create a gateway to an NDS volume, type the complete NDS volume name
(such as cn=volume.ou=unit.o=group) in Network Path in the New Share dialog
box after clicking the Gateway button. For this to work, the NTGATEWAY
group must exist in the organizational unit (ou) where the volume is
created, and the gateway account must be a member of the NTGATEWAY group on
that ou.
<P>
<P><h2>Client Licenses</h2>
 
<P>
Occasionally, client licenses are held after a user logs off.  The problem
can appear on the client workstation from one of the following areas that
may cause this problem on the client workstation:

<UL><LI>Print event logging. The license can be held between print messages that
   are logged in Event Viewer. To resolve this problem, disable logging on
   the client workstation.
<P>
   To disable print event logging:
<P>
   1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Printers.
   2. On the File menu, click Server Properties.
   3. Click  the Advanced tab and then clear the Log spooler error events,
<P><PRE>      Log spooler warning events, and Log spooler information events check
      boxes.
</PRE>   4. Shutdown and restart your computer.

<LI>RAS Service. The license may be held by the RAS service when no one is
   logged in.  As soon as someone (either the same or different user) logs
   into the client workstation, the license will be released.
<P>
</UL><h2>Dynamic Display Properties</h2>
 
<P>
Windows NT Workstation and Windows NT Server version 4.0 allow you to
change your display properties without rebooting your computer. To change
display properties, right click on the desktop and choose Properties.
<P>
Some applications may freeze or close abruptly if you change display
properties while the program is running, resulting in the loss of unsaved
data. You should close terminal emulators, remote control hosts and
clients, and other similar applications before changing anything on the
Appearance, Plus!, or Settings tabs of the Display Properties dialog box.
