The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
As discussed in the Microsoft Windows NT Workstation Deployment Guide,
Unattend.txt and Sysdiff.exe cannot be used to preinstall sound cards and
hardware devices. These devices must be installed after installation has
been completed. To install devices during setup, the commands must be
placed in the Cmdlines.txt file.
<P>
However, by using the runonce key in the registry, you may set up various
Control Panel tools so that they will start after the first time a
workstation has logged on so that the administrator may add sound cards
and tape drives. You can also place the entries in the Cmdlines.txt file so
that the desired Control Panel tools will start during the
installation of Windows NT.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
For detailed instructions on using the Runonce option, consult the
Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Deployment Guide, Chapter 5, and refer to the
section on “Executing a Batch File on First Logon to Customize Windows NT.”
The Deployment Guide may be viewed from the following Web site:
<PRE>     
        <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/ntworkstation">http://www.microsoft.com/ntworkstation.</A></B>

</PRE>To have the Multimedia tool under Control Panel automatically start when
logging on, place the following line in the runonce key:
<P>
<PRE>   "Multimedia"="rundll32.exe shell32.dll,Control_RunDLL mmsys.cpl,@0"

</PRE>NOTE: Multimedia is the value name, the data type is REG_SZ and the value
is rundll32.exe and so on. The syntax is the same for each of the following
lines.
<P>
To have the Multimedia tool start up when logging on, place the following
line in the runonce key:
<P>
<PRE>   "Soundcard"="rundll32.exe shell32.dll,Control_RunDLL mmsys.cpl,@0,4"

</PRE>To have the SCSI tool start up when logging on, place the following line in
the runonce key:
<P>
<PRE>   "SCSI"="rundll32.exe shell32.dll,Control_RunDLL devapps.cpl,@1"

</PRE>To have the Tape tool start up when logging on, place the following line in
runonce:
<P>
<PRE>   "Tape"="rundll32.exe shell32.dll,Control_RunDLL devapps.cpl,@2"

</PRE>To have the Server tool start up when logging on, place the following line
in runonce:
<P>
<PRE>   "Server"="rundll32.exe shell32.dll,Control_RunDLL srvmgr.cpl,@0"

</PRE>To have the Services tool start up when logging on, place the following
line in runonce:
<P>
<PRE>   "Services"="rundll32.exe shell32.dll,Control_RunDLL srvmgr.cpl,@1"

</PRE>To have the Devices tool start up when logging on, place the following line
in runonce:
<P>
<PRE>   "Devices"="rundll32.exe shell32.dll,Control_RunDLL srvmgr.cpl,@2"

</PRE>The above examples are not a complete list of all Control Panel
tools that may be automatically started. Notice that SCSI and Tape
share a common .cpl file, devapps.cpl, but have different ending
parameters.
<P>
To test other .cpl files (including third party), you can copy and paste
the Rundll32.exe segment from the above lines to the Start \ Run command
line.  For example, the following line will bring up the Add/Remove tool:
<P>
<PRE>   "rundll32.exe shell32.dll,Control_RunDLL Appwiz.cpl,@0,1"

</PRE>Changing the last number from one to two will open the Add/Remove tool with
the Windows NT Setup tab selected.
<P>
To keep the unattended setup unattended, you can add these lines to a
batch file or other script added to the runonce key, as well as a macro or
other script.
