<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
You can create software RAID 5 stripe sets with parity partitions in
Windows NT Server.
<P>
RAID 5 stripe sets consist of striping data with parity information across
multiple drives in 64KB stripes. During the initialization stage of
creating the stripe set with parity, Windows NT Server calculates the
parity information for each 64KB stripe.
<P>
You are not inhibited by Windows NT Disk Administrator from formatting the
stripe set and then immediately using the volume while initialization is
still in progress. Windows NT Server also does not inhibit you from using a
volume that is being recovered during regeneration after a drive failure.
This is because the FTDISK driver makes sure that all changes made to the
disk are mirrored in the parity block. The driver takes care of all
synchronization problems including the writing of the data catching up with
the initialization of the parity.
<P>
However, while the volume is initializing or regenerating, it is "exposed";
in other words, if a drive failure occurs while the stripe set with parity
is initializing, you will lose your entire set. It is only after the
stripe set is initialized that you have any fault tolerance. The same
process occurs with bad sectors. Sector sparing is not enabled until after
initialization is complete.
<P>
If you choose to use the volume during initialization or regeneration, you
run the risk of losing any and all data on the volume if in the event the
initialization process fails. Because of this, Microsoft recommends waiting
for a complete initialization or regeneration of the stripe set before
you use it to ensure the protection and integrity of your data.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Event Viewer will contain events reporting when the stripe set starts
initialization, completes initialization, or fails initialization.
