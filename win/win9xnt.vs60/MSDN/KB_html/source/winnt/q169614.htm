The information in this article applies to:

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After you print numerous jobs from Windows NT 4.0 to your Hewlett-Packard
(HP) DeskJet 500-series printer, you may notice that your computer is 
running low on system resources. This problem may eventually lead to 
system instability and low-memory errors.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The HP DeskJet 500-series printer driver included with Windows NT 4.0 may
not return all system resources used during a printing operation.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, reboot the computer from which you are 
printing. This reinitializes all memory and system resources used by 
Windows NT 4.0.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Total kernel memory may grow and not be fully reduced to its initial size
after printing is completed when you are printing to an HP DeskJet 500-
series printer. Kernel memory usage may grow slightly after one print job
is completed and continue to grow slightly after each succeeding print 
job.
<P>
Because the amount of kernel memory lost with each print job is relatively
small (generally 30-40K), this issue occurs only after a very large number
of print jobs are printed without rebooting the computer.
<P>
To view total kernel memory, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Use the right mouse button to click an empty area on the taskbar, and
   then click Task Manager.

<P><LI>Click the Performance tab. The Total value in the Kernel Memory area
   lists the total kernel memory value.
<P></OL>
