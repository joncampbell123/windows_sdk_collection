The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
There are three situations in which you will receive an "Access
Denied" message across untrusted domains when accessing a resource
that has permissions for Everyone.

<OL><P><LI>When a user from an untrusted domain attempts to access the server
   and they have the same user name with a different password defined
   in that domain, they'll be prompted for a password or receive an
   "Access Denied" message depending on the operation.
<P>
   Workaround
   ----------
<P>
   For accessing file servers on the other domain, you can work around
   this problem by providing the correct DOMAIN/USERNAME in the Connect
   As dialog box in File Manager and then providing the correct password.
   Otherwise, if the user has the same user name on both domains, make
   sure that the passwords match, or set up a two-way trust relationship
   between the two domains.

<P><LI>The Guest account on the domain is disabled. This is the default for
   Windows NT Advanced Server. If a user from an untrusted domain is
   trying to access the server remotely, they will receive an "Access
   Denied" message because there is no valid user name that they can use
   to make the connection.
<P>
   Workaround
   ----------
<P>
   Enable the Guest Account on the Windows NT Advanced Server.

<P><LI>If your account or all of the groups you belong to do not have the
   right to "access this computer from network," you will receive this
   error message.
<P>
   Workaround
   ----------
<P>
   Use User Manager to add the "access this computer from network"
   right to your account.
