The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When audit policies are set to log User and Group Management events, some
Event IDs are not recorded in the event log when the event to which they
refer occurs.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The following Events should be recorded when auditing User and Group
Management events:

<UL><LI>Event ID 625: User Account Type Change
   (Indicates that a user account's type has been changed)

<LI>Event ID 626: User Account Enabled
   (Indicates that a user account has been enabled)

<LI>Event ID 628: User Account password set
   (Indicates that a user account's password has been set)

<LI>Event ID 629: User Account Disabled
   (Indicates that a user account has been disabled)

<LI>Event ID 640: General Account Database Change
   (Indicates that a change has been made to the Security Account Manager
   [SAM] database)
<P>
</UL>All of these events are logged as Event ID 642: User Account Changed, and
the record indicates that a change has been made to a User Account.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
