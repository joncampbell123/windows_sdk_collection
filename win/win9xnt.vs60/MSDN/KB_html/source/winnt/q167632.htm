<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After you apply Windows NT version 4.0 Service Pack 2 to a computer with a
Micro Channel Architecture (MCA) network adapter, you may receive the
following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   At least one service or driver failed during system startup.
   Use Event Viewer to examine the event log for details.

</PRE>When you look at the event log, you see the following entry:
<P>
<PRE>   Event ID: 7000
   Source: Service Control Manager
   Description: A device connected to the system is not functioning.

</PRE>After you log on to the computer, you may have no network access through
the MCA network adapter.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Ndis.sys device driver in Service Pack 2 fails to detect any network
cards installed in MCA slots 8 or higher. Network cards installed in slots
1 through 7 are detected by Windows NT and function normally.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
If the MCA network adapter was working fine prior to installing Service
Pack 2, you can rename the Ndis.sys file found in the
%systemroot%\System32\Drivers directory and use the Expand utility to
expand the Ndis.sys from the compact disc or copy the Ndis.sys file from
the service pack uninstall $NtServicePackUninstall$ directory and reboot.
<P>
-or-
<P>
You can physically move the affected network adapter to a lower MCA slot
number in order for the Service Pack 2 Ndis.sys driver to use it.
<P>
You usually must re-run the Micro Channel configuration utility to Update
your computer’s configuration after moving the MCA network adapter to a
different slot. Consult your computer manufacturer’s user guide for
complete instructions.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. We
are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
