<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article discusses reporting problems, Windows NT hardware
compatibility tests (HCT) results, the hardware compatibility list (HCL)
and the Windows NT device certification.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Windows NT Hardware Compatibility Tests</h3>
 
<P>
If you have any questions or problem running the HCT, report them to the
Windows NT HCT group by completing PROBREP.TXT (located in the I386
directory on the Windows). To send the completed PROBREP.TXT to Microsoft:

<UL><LI>FAX the PROBREP.TXT contents to Microsoft Windows NT HCT, Building 2
   at (425) 93-MSFAX

<LI>Mail PROBREP.TXT (as an attachment) to NTHCTEXT@Microsoft.com
<P>
</UL>NOTE: Microsoft does not provide product support for HCT.
<P>
<P><h3>Windows NT Hardware Compatibility List</h3>
 
<P>
In order for computers to be listed on the Windows NT Hardware
Compatibility List, the device must pass all of the system compatibility
tests in the HCT kit (refer to Chapter 2 of the HCT Guide for additional
information). Every floppy disk that you send should have one set of test
results. The floppy disks must be labeled with the following information:
<P>
<PRE>   &lt;Your company name&gt;
   Windows NT version X.X
   &lt;Computer ID&gt;
   &lt;Marketed Model Name the results represent&gt;

</PRE>NOTE: If a single test configuration is marketed as multiple products
please list the other model names on the floppy disk as well. If you send a
README file or other notes with your results, please enclose a printed
copy.
<P>
Microsoft reserves the right to require a computer be sent to the Microsoft
HCT Labs for verification of compatibility if problems are encountered on
the computer that has previously passed compatibility testing.
<P>
After the computer passes all the required tests, please send the floppy
disks with the test results to the following address by Federal Express or
by DHL (to prevent Customs delays if outside of the United States):
<P>
<PRE>   Windows NT Hardware Compatibility Test
   Building 2
   Microsoft Corporation
   One Microsoft Way
   Redmond, WA 98052-6399
   USA

</PRE><h3>Windows NT Device Certification</h3>
 
<P>
In addition to the HCT program, Microsoft also offers a certification
program for hardware devices and adapters. This program is fee-based and is
administered by the Microsoft Compatibility Labs (MCL). For more
information on this program, contact MCL at (425) 635-4949.
