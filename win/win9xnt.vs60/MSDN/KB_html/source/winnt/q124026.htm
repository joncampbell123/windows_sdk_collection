<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Windows NT Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) client IP address
lease requests fails on a multihomed server configured with multiple
logical IP networks on a single network interface card (NIC).
<P>
This logical multihomed system is a Windows NT Server with a single NIC
configured with multiple IP addresses for one physical segment. If this
server is also functioning as a DHCP server with active scopes configured
for each logical IP network, DHCP client requests are filled until the
scope defining the first logical IP address pool is exhausted. Further DHCP
client requests fail to be filled from the pool of IP addresses available
from the second or higher logical IP network scopes.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this problem, install a NIC in the DHCP server for each logical
segment. Each NIC should be connected to the same physical segment and
assigned only one logical IP address. As DHCP scopes are created they will
be made available to the clients via the network interface card at this IP
network. Also verify that IP routing has been enabled on this multihomed
DHCP server.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This is by design. This forces clients residing on a physical segment to
acquire IP addresses that are within the same IP network scope.
<P>
More Information
 
Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0 Service Pack 2 includes the ability to 
create DHCP superscopes, which allows the administrator to group scopes 
together. This eliminates the need of multiple adapters to service multiple 
scopes.
<P>
For more information on superscopes, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
