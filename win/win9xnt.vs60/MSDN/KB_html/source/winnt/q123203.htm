<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Within the X.25 network protocol specification, the X.121 specification
defines the format of the X.25 address. The structure of X.25 addresses
resembles phone numbers.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following text explains the structure of the X.25 address.
<P>
<P><h3>Data Network Identification Code (DNIC)</h3>
 
<P>
The DNIC makes up the first four digits in an X.121 or X.25 address.
<P>
<P><h3>Country Code</h3>
 
<P>
The first three digits in the DNIC are the country code. For example, the
country code for Canada is 302, so every X.25 network address in Canada
begins with 302. The U.S. has several country codes. U.S. DNICs can start
with 310, 311, 312, or 313.
<P>
<P><h3>Network ID</h3>
 
<P>
The fourth digit is the Network ID, identifying which network it is. For
example, DataPac of Canada has a network ID of 0, so the DNIC for DataPac
is 3020. Infoswitch of Canada has a network ID of 9, so Infoswitch has a
DNIC of 3029. In the U.S. MCI has a DNIC of 3106, Sprinet has a DNIC of
3110, and Infonet has a DNIC of 3137.
<P>
<P><h3>The National Number</h3>
 
<P>
The National Number is the 5th through 12th digits of the X.25 address.
This number is used to identify a unique DCE node (X.25 node) within a
network. Network vendors lease DCE or X.25 nodes. Each of these nodes must
have a unique X.121 address. Within a given vendor's X.25 network, the
first four digits of the DCE addresses will all be the same--they will be
the DNIC for the vendor. Digits 5 through 12 (the National Number) are
assigned by the network vendor to create a unique X.25 address for each
X.25 node, or Circuit Terminating Equipment (DCE).
<P>
<P><h3>Subaddress</h3>
 
<P>
Most networks support a two-digit subaddress, which can be added to the end
of the National Number. The two digits are not used by the network, but are
passed through for use by the user's Data Terminating Equipment (DTE). The
DTE is primarily the X.25 card (Eicon or Atlantis) that the X.25
application uses to communicate with the network DCE node, where each
physical port on an X.25 card is connected to a DCE node.
<P>
The two subaddress digits are usually used when X.25 applications are
located on LAN workstations. Eicon and Atlantis cards require a two-digit
subaddress when they will be managing X.25 sessions (or virtual circuits)
for X.25 applications (such as an MTA or X.400 Gateway) when the
application is running on a LAN workstation that does not contain the Eicon
or Atlantis card.
<P>
Note that the .INI entry "X25SubAddress=" for MTA in PC Mail version 3.2x
is somewhat misleading because when the .INI also has the entry
"CommType=X25Eicon", the "X25SubAddress" will always be the X.25 address of
the network DCE the Eicon port is attached to (usually a 12-digit number
composed of DNIC and a National Number), with the actual two-digit
subaddress appended to the end of the long X.25 (X.121) address if it is
needed. For MTAs launched with the INI entry "CommType=X25Atlan", the .INI
entry "X25SubAddress=" is only two digits. The difference is due to design
differences between the Ecion and Atlantis cards.
<P>
<P><h3>Inter-Network</h3>
 
<P>
Sometimes to make a connection between two networks in two different
countries, an extra digit is added before the DNIC, usually a one. This
varies by vendor.
<P>
The current maximum length for an X.121 address is 15 digits. The typical
address length is 12 or 14 digits.
<P>
<P><h3>Null-Modem Operation</h3>
 
<P>
When two X.25 cards are connected with an X.25 null-modem cable, there is
no network present and the long X.121 address is not needed. The optional
two-digit subaddress will be needed if the X.25 cards are also connected to
a LAN and will be establishing X.25 sessions for PC Mail version 3.2x MTAs,
Gateways or MS Exchange processes running on LAN PCs, PCs without the X.25
card installed in them.
