The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5 and 3.51
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5 and 3.51
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Names registered by the WINS server can be divided into three groups:

<UL><LI>Computer Name
<LI>Domain Name
<LI>Other/Special Names
<P>
</UL>Each WINS Client actually registers its name with the WINS Server three or
four times.
<P>
NOTE: The MS-DOS clients that ship with Windows NT version 3.5 (LAN
Manager
version 2.2c client for MS-DOS and Microsoft Network Client version 3.0)
provide support for WINS resolution, but not registration.
<P>
Several special NetBIOS names are also registered to maintain and retrieve
browse lists. Names listed here are indicated by "Name(xx)" name followed
by the hex value (xx) and padded with spaces to the 16th byte.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Registered Computer Names:
<P>
<PRE>   \\&lt;computer_name&gt;[00h]
   This name is registered for the WINS Client Workstation name.

   \\&lt;computer_name&gt;[03h]
   This name is registered for the Messenger Service on the WINS.

</PRE>Client:
<P>
<PRE>   \\&lt;computer_name&gt;[BFh]
   Network monitoring utility (group name, registered when running netmon)
   This name is registered for the Network Monitoring Agent service and
   will only appear if the service is started on the system. If the
   computer name is not a full 15 characters, the name will be padded with
   plus (+) symbols.

   \\&lt;computer_name&gt;[BEh]
   Network monitoring agent (unique name, registered when remote agent is
   started)

   \\&lt;computer_name&gt;[1Fh]
   This name is registered for the Network Dynamic Data Exchange (NetDDE)
   services and will only appear if the NetDDE services are started on the
   system. By default, under Windows NT version 3.5, the NetDDE services
   are not automatically started.

   \\&lt;computer_name&gt;[20h]
   This name is registered for the Server Service on the WINS Client.

   \\&lt;computer_name&gt;[21h]
   RAS client.

   \\&lt;computer_name&gt;[06h]
   RAS server service.

</PRE>Registered Domain Names:
<P>
<PRE>   \\&lt;domain_name&gt;[00h]
   This instance of the domain name is registered by the Workstation so
   that it can receive browser broadcasts from LAN Manager-based systems.
   This is the name to which server announcements are broadcast in
   Microsoft LAN Manager so that other Microsoft LAN Manager computers can
   track the servers on the network. Windows NT computers do not make
</PRE>these
<PRE>   broadcasts unless the LMAnnounce option has been enabled by configuring
   the Server service in the Control Panel/Networks application.

   \\&lt;domain_name&gt;[1Bh]
   This instance of the domain name is registered by the Windows NT Server
   system that is running as the Domain Master Browser and is used to
</PRE>allow
<PRE>   remote browsing of domains. When a WINS Server is queried for this
</PRE>name,
<PRE>   a WINS Server returns the IP address of the system that registered this
   name.

   \\&lt;domain_name&gt;[1Ch]
   This name is registered for use by the domain controllers within the
   domain and can contain up to 25 IP addresses. One IP address will be
   that of the Primary Domain Controller (PDC) and the other 24 will be
</PRE>the
<PRE>   IP addresses of Backup Domain Controllers (BDCs). The [1Ch] domain name
   is used by the BDCs to locate the PDC and is used when pass-through
   authentication is needed to validate a logon request.

   \\&lt;domain_name&gt;[1Dh]
   This instance of the domain name is registered only by the Master
   Browser, of which there can only be one for the domain. This name is
   used by the Backup Browsers to communicate with the Master Browser in
   order to retrieve the list of available servers from the Master
</PRE>Browser.
<P>
<PRE>   \\&lt;domain_name&gt;[1Eh]
   This name is registered by all Browser servers and Potential Browser
   servers in a domain or workgroup. It is used for announcement requests
   which are sent by Master Browsers to fill up its browse lists, and for
   election request packets to force an election.

</PRE>Other/Special Names:
<P>
In addition to computer names and domain names, the following names also
appear in the WINS database.
<P>
<PRE>   \\--__MSBROWSE__[01h]
   This name is registered by the Master Browser and is used to broadcast
   and receive domain announcements on the local subnet. It is through
</PRE>this
<PRE>   name that Master Browsers for different domains learn the names of
   different domains and the names of the Master Browsers on those
</PRE>domains.
<PRE>   When a WINS Server receives a name query for this name, the WINS Server
   will always return the subnet broadcast address for the requesting
   client's local subnet.

   \\&lt;username&gt;[03h]
   When viewing the WINS database, the usernames for the currently logged
   on users will also be registered in the WINS database. The username is
   registered by the Server component so that the user can receive any
'net
   send' commands sent to their username.
