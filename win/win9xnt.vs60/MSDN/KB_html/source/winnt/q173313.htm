<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In some cases, Ntbackup.exe can read tapes created by third-party tape
backup utilities. This can be useful in situations in which the third-party
backup software is not readily available for some reason, such as when a
computer has been rebuilt. For Ntbackup.exe to read the tape successfully,
the software used to create the tape must support the Microsoft tape format
(MTF), and it must not compress the data.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
It is possible that Ntbackup.exe may not be able to read a catalog of files
written on a tape by third-party backup software, because the on-tape
catalog (OTC) is not present or is not compatible with Ntbackup.exe. In
this case, the tape will not be recognized as part of a set. To resolve
this part of the problem, Ntbackup.exe needs to be started with the
/missingtape command line switch, using the steps below:

<OL><P><LI>Click Start, and then click Run.

<P><LI>Type the following command and then press ENTER:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Ntbackup /missingtape
</PRE><P>
</OL>The /missingtape switch allows the tape to be read as an individual tape
(as opposed to being part of a set), which will allow Ntbackup.exe to
catalog the tape. After the tape is catalogued, files on it will become
accessible.
<P>
In addition, tapes created in one manufacturer’s tape drive may not be
compatible with another manufacturer’s tape drive. If this is the case, you
will not be able to continue without the third-party software or an
identical tape drive.
