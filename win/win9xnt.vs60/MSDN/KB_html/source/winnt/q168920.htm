The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0
 
<P>
IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information on how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" online Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry
Key" online Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you lock down a Windows NT 4.0 client, users still have the Documents
folder on the Start menu. This article discusses methods to disable the
Documents folder so that it always reads (Empty).
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To disable the Documents folder on the Start menu, select the procedure
according to the following three configurations:

<UL><LI>NTFS partition on a computer running Windows NT Workstation 4.0 or
   Windows NT Server 4.0

<LI>FAT partition on a networked computer running Windows NT Workstation 4.0
   or Windows NT Server 4.0

<LI>FAT partition on stand-alone computer running Windows NT Workstation 4.0
   or Windows NT Server 4.0
<P>
</UL>Ideally, the first fix is the easiest to implement and restore. The other
techniques require editing the registry and are more complex. The last
method requires disabling the Recycle Bin and this should be used only in
the direst of situations.
<P>
NTFS Partition on a Computer Running Windows NT Workstation 4.0 or Windows
NT Server 4.0:

<OL><P><LI>Log on as the user who needs folder disabled.

<P><LI>Go to &lt;winnt systemroot&gt;\Profiles\&lt;username&gt;\Recent
<P>
   NOTE: You may have to go into Options (on the View menu) in Windows
   Explorer and select Show All Files to see Recent, which is a hidden
   file.

<P><LI>Set permissions on Recent so that everyone has read-only access.
<P>
   NOTE: On Windows NT Server and in other instances, there may be other
   users in the Recent permissions. Everyone is the only group that can be
   there, with only read access.

Windows NT Server 4.0:
