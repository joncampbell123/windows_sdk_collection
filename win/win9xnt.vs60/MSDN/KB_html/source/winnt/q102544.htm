<P><h3>1.0  Introduction</h3>
 
This release of Microsoft Windows NT 3.1 U.S. Service Pack 3 contains all
the components that have been fixed since the retail release of Windows NT
3.1 and Windows NT Advanced Server 3.1.  The Service Pack is easy to apply
from within Windows NT and changes only those files that were originally
set up on the Windows NT or Windows NT Advanced Server system.  Service
Pack releases are cumulative:  they contain all previous fixes, as well as
any new fixes made to the system.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>2.0  Installation Instructions for the Windows NT U.S. Service Pack</h3>

<P>
<P><h3>2.1  User Notes</h3>
 
<P>
*** Installing Service Pack 3 on a Dual-Boot computer with the Windows NT
<PRE>    3.5 (Daytona) Beta

</PRE>If your computer is dual-booting Windows NT 3.1 and the Windows NT 3.5
(Daytona) Beta, you must perform the following steps before you install
Service Pack 3:

<OL><P><LI>Copy the files NTLDR and NTDETECT.COM in your root drive to NTLDR.SAV
   and NTDETECT.SAV.

<P><LI>Install the Service Pack.

<P><LI>Copy NTLDR.SAV to NTLDR, and NTDETECT.SAV to NTDETECT.COM.
<P>
</OL>This will allow your machine to continue dual-booting both versions of
Windows NT.
<P>
<P>
*** Running the File System Update from the Windows NT 3.5 (Daytona) Beta
<P>
Once you have installed Service Pack 3, you should not install the file
system update for Windows NT 3.1 from the Windows NT 3.5 (Daytona) Beta.
Service Pack 3 contains all the fixes that are in the Windows NT 3.5
(Daytona) Beta file system update, as well as other fixes.
<P>
<P>
*** Issues with MS-DOS-based Communications Programs
<P>
If you experience difficulties with MS-DOS-based communications programs
after installing Service Pack 3, change the configuration of the program to
enable software flow control (XON/XOFF) instead of hardware flow control
(RTS/CTS).  Changing this parameter has been found to correct problems with
these applications in most cases.
<P>
<P>
*** Installing the Service Pack on a System with an OEM supplied HAL.DLL
<P>
If your Windows NT system uses a HAL.DLL supplied by an OEM (one that was
not installed from the Microsoft Windows NT 3.1 disk set) you need to
follow the steps below to reinstall the OEM HAL after the Service Pack
Update program has been run, but before the machine is rebooted.  If you do
not reinstall the OEM HAL properly, your system may not boot after
installing the Service Pack (because the OEM HAL will have been replaced by
a HAL from the Service Pack). If this happens, use your Emergency Repair
Disk to repair your system, then follow the steps below.

<OL><P><LI>Before the Update program is run, copy the HAL.DLL file to HAL.OEM to
   save it.  On an x86 machine, HAL.DLL is located in the %windir%\system32
   directory.  On a MIPS or Alpha machine, the following command should
   locate it:
<P>
<P><PRE>      DIR /S %windir%\..\hal.dll
</PRE>
<P><LI>After the Update program has been run, but before you have it reboot
   your system, start a Command Prompt window, and restore the HAL.DLL you
   saved in step (1).  On an x86 machine,
<P>
<P><PRE>      CD %windir%\system32
      COPY HAL.OEM HAL.DLL
</PRE>
<P><LI>Now switch back to the Update program and have it reboot your system.
<P>
<P>
</OL>*** Configuring the NWLink Transport
<P>
When configuring the NWLink transport using the Network option in Control
Panel, you must enter the Network Number as a hexadecimal value rather than
as a decimal value as stated in the Help file.
<P>
<P>
*** Converting Macintosh Filenames to Win32 Filenames
<P>
In general, the Windows NT (Win32) interface can view and use filenames
created by a Macintosh client.  There are two exceptions, where the
filename is an illegal Win32 filename:
<P>
<PRE>   The Macintosh client creates a filename that ends with a period.

   The Macintosh client creates a filename that ends with a blank space.

</PRE></OL>In both of these cases, the Windows NT interface displays the filename
with a thick vertical bar (|) or question mark (?) character replacing
the final period or space.  Only the last character is replaced.
For example:
<P>
<PRE>   Macintosh filename         Windows NT displays the filename as . . .
   ------------------         -----------------------------------------
   An important file.         An important file|
   Very important file ...    Very important file ..|
   One space at the end       One space at the end|
   Two spaces at the end      Two spaces at the end |

</PRE>You can view and use the converted filenames in the Windows NT interface.
You cannot view and use them from the Command Prompt (CMD.EXE).  A Win16
application that converts long filenames to the 8.3 format can convert
these filenames to the 8.3 format.
<P>
For Macintosh filenames that already exist on the Services For Macintosh
server, before this updated functionality, the server will rename such
files the first time they are accessed.
<P>
The final character is mapped to an unused UNICODE character (0xF000+xx).
Windows NT does this same mapping for characters that are illegal in the
NTFS file system.
<P>
<P>
*** Updating Printer Drivers Installed for a Different Platform
<P>
The Service Pack only updates printer drivers for the platform you install
it on.  For example: If you update an Intel-based print server that you
have MIPS computers printing to, it needs to have the MIPS version of the
printer driver installed. The Service Pack only copies the Intel-based
printer driver to the print server. In this case, you need to copy over the
appropriate driver by hand.
<P>
The following procedure describes how to install the PostScript printer
driver by hand.

<OL><P><LI> Rename PSCRIPT.DLL and PSCRPTUI.DLL in the directory below to
<P><PRE>    PSCRIPT.OLD and PSCRPTUI.OLD
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       system32\spool\drivers\&lt;platform&gt;
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    where &lt;platform&gt; is w32mips, w32alpha, or w32x86.
</PRE>
<P><LI> For MIPS or ALPHA drivers, copy the PSCRIPT.DLL and PSCRPTUI.DLL files
<P><PRE>    from the MIPS or ALPHA subdirectories on the CD-ROM to the subdirectory
    in Step 1 above. For Intel-based drivers, type
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       expand -r PSCRIPT.DL_ &lt;subdirectory from step 1&gt;
       expand -r PSCRPTUI.DL_ &lt;subdirectory from step 1&gt;
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    from the i386 subdirectory on the CD-ROM where &lt;subdirectory&gt; is the
    subdirectory from Step 1.
</PRE><P>
<P>
</OL>*** Emergency Repair Disk
<P>
If it is necessary to use the Windows NT Emergency Repair Disk to repair
your Windows NT system at some time after you apply the Service Pack, you
will need to re-apply the Service Pack after the repair is completed.  This
is because the Emergency Repair Disk repairs your system by restoring your
original Windows NT setup.  After the repair has completed, simply follow
the above Installation Instructions to re-apply the Service Pack.
<P>
<P>
*** Adding New Components to the System
<P>
If new software or hardware components are changed or added to your system
after you have applied the Service Pack, it will be necessary to re-apply
the Service Pack.  This is because the files taken from the original
Windows NT disk set may not be equivalent to the files on the Service Pack
disk set. It is not possible to install new components directly from the
Service Pack media (such as a new keyboard or printer driver).  New
components must be installed from the original product media.
<P>
<P>
*** Command Reference Colors
<P>
Some commands in the Command Reference (NTCMDS.HLP) list of commands are
not visible if your system colors are set to Window Text = white and Window
Background = black.  Change your Windows Background to a lighter color to
see all the commands in the list.
<P>
<P>
*** Previous Versions of NTBackup
<P>
Backup tapes created with the version of NTBackup shipping with this
Service Pack cannot be restored or read with versions of NTBackup shipped
prior to Service Pack 2.  However, tapes created with previous versions of
NTBackup  can be read and restored by the version of NTBackup in this
Service Pack. NTBackup now uses Unicode whenever it writes to tape, which
was not understood by previous versions of NTBackup.
<P>
<P>
*** Previous Versions of Services For Macintosh (SFM)
<P>
To correct a problem with file names ending in a space or period, a change
was made to the Services For Macintosh software which makes earlier
versions of this software unable to correctly read Macintosh file names on
the Windows NT Advanced Server system.  The new Services For Macintosh
software will alter the NTFS file name to allow Macintosh clients to
properly view them.  This means that once you update your Services For
Macintosh system files with this Service Pack, versions of the SFM software
prior to Service Pack 2 will not function properly if installed on the
system.
<P>
<P>
*** Installing Symbol Files from the CD-ROM
<P>
To install the symbol files corresponding to the new binaries in Service
Pack 3, do the following (assuming your CD-ROM drive is D:, your symbol
files are located in the C:\WINNT\SYMBOLS directory, and you are installing
the files for an x86 machine):
<P>
<PRE>   XCOPY /S /U /D D:\SUPPORT\DEBUG\I386\SYMBOLS C:\WINNT\SYMBOLS

</PRE></OL>This will copy the Service Pack 3 .DBG files over the existing versions of
these files.  The XCOPY command shown will copy only those .DBG files that
are already installed (/U switch), and only those with a more recent time-
date stamp (/D switch).
