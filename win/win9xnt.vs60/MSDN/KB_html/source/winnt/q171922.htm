The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
You may experience slow connections and performance or even loss of
connectivity on your local area network (LAN) after you have made a Point-
to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) connection to a Windows NT 4.0 PPTP
server.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Windows NT 4.0 PPTP clients add an incorrect local subnet route to their
route tables when they connect to a PPTP server that is using the same IP
network ID.
<P>
For example, the client and the server are both on LAN subnets of a class
B address such as 172.16.0.0, using a 255.255.255.0 subnet mask. The
server is on the 172.16.1.0 subnet and the client is on the 172.16.2.0
subnet. When the client connects through PPTP, it adds a route to the
172.16.0.0 network with a gateway of the PPTP server to its route table,
which increases the time it takes to locate LAN resources.
<P>
NOTE: If the PPTP server has no route to the PPTP client's subnet, the
client will not be able to connect to its local subnet.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this issue, use the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Disable Use Default Gateway on Remote Network for the phone book entry
   that you use to dial the PPTP server.
<P>
   NOTE: If Use Default Gateway on Remote Network is not checked, the bad
   local subnet route is not added.

<P><LI>Delete the existing default gateway (if one exists) by typing the
   following at a command prompt:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Route delete 0.0.0.0
</PRE>
<P><LI>Dial your PPTP phone book entry to make the connection to your PPTP
   server.

<P><LI>Add a new default gateway to the PPTP network by typing the following
   at a command prompt:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Route add 0.0.0.0 mask 0.0.0.0 X.X.X.X
</PRE><P>
   Where X.X.X.X is your client's IP address assigned by the PPTP server.

<P><LI>After you disconnect, re-add your local default gateway by typing the
   following command at a command prompt:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Route add 0.0.0.0 mask 0.0.0.0 Y.Y.Y.Y
</PRE><P>
   Where Y.Y.Y.Y is the IP address of the default gateway, or router, on
   your LAN.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. We
are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
