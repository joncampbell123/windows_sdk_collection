<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
There are 2 types of distributed routing technologies. They are distance
vector and link state. This article discusses link state routing.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Routers that use a link state routing protocol maintain a database of their
individual autonomous system (AS)topology. An autonomous system is a group
or collection of networks under common administration using the same
routing protocol, and is sometimes called a routing domain. Autonomous
systems are commonly divided into areas tied together by a backbone area.
Each router in an autonomous system has an identical link state database
(LSB). The link state database is composed of each router's local state.
<P>
Routers distribute their local state by flooding the autonomous system with
link state advertisements (sometimes referred to as link state packets).
Link state advertisements (LSAs) are special packets which contain
information about neighbors and route cost. These LSAs can also contain
routing information gathered by other routing protocols and static routes.
<P>
All routers in an autonomous system run the same routing algorithm. From
the link state database, each router builds a tree of shortest paths with
itself as the root. The tree contains the route to each destination in the
autonomous system.
<P>
Common link state routing protocols are open shortest path first (OSPF) and
intermediate system-to-intermediate system interdomain routing protocol
(IS-IS).
