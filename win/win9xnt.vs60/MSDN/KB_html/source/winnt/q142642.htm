<PRE>                              SUMMARY
                              =======

</PRE>This article contains a copy of the information in the Readme.wri file
included in Windows NT version 4.0. Setup copies this file to the System32
folder.
<P>
<PRE>                          MORE INFORMATION
                          ================

                           Hardware Notes

</PRE>NOTE: Be sure to check that all equipment—including video cards, networking
cards, monitors, CPUs, hard drives, and CD-ROM drives—is listed on the
Windows NT version 4.0 Hardware Compatibility List, included with this
product.
<P>
If you are using a system or equipment that is not included on the hardware
compatibility list, and experience problems, please file a report by using
the &lt;platform&gt;\Probrep.txt  file on the Windows NT version 4.0 compact
disc.  &lt;Platform&gt; is either X86, MIPS, ALPHA, or PPC, depending on your
computer's platform. The Probrep.txt file is also installed in the
%systemroot%\system32 folder.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>ATAPI and PCI</h2>
 
<P>
ATAPI.SYS now controls all IDE devices in a PCI machine. If you have a
computer that uses IDE hard disks, has a PCI bus, and are upgrading from
Windows NT version 3.51 to Windows NT version 4.0,  you may receive a
message when the system is booting stating that a driver has failed to
start. In Event Viewer, you will see that the ATDISK driver failed to
start. To disable the driver and associated box, double-click the Devices
icon in Control Panel, and then disable the ATDISK driver.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>Caching Disk Controllers and Drives</h2>
 
<P>
Windows NT supports caching disk controllers and drives only if one of the
following is true:

<UL><LI>The controller has a driver that specifically supports caching. (Several
   of these exist: DPT and IBM SCSI Caching Adapter.)
<LI>Write-through is active (i.e., write caching is disabled) by setting it
   either manually or by default when the computer starts.
<LI>The entire cache option is off, by setting it either manually or by
   default when the computer starts.
<P>
</UL>Using a caching controller or drive in other situations risks loss of data
if the computer is rebooted or if a power failure occurs before the cache
has flushed itself. You can minimize risk by waiting at least one minute
(less if you know the maximum time the cache waits before flushing itself)
after all system activity stops before rebooting. The disk activity light
is a good indicator of how write caching is being done on your system. This
applies to the initial Windows NT installation as well as to shutdown. Note
that unexpected power failure at any time can potentially corrupt data on
the disk, possibly to the extent that the disk becomes unreadable. Making
the delay time that write data is cached before being flushed to disk as
small as possible reduces this risk.
<P>
Certain applications are data-sensitive and require that write-through be
active. Examples of this are SQL Server-based applications and NTFS
partitions.
<P>
<P><h2>CD-ROM Changers</h2>
 

<UL><LI>Some IDE/ATAPI CD-ROM Changers may take an excessive amount of time to
   read all of their compact discs. This may be especially apparent while
   using Windows NT Explorer, or using an Open dialog box (accessed from
   the File menu) from certain applications. Some ATAPI CD-ROM changers
   cannot report their media change status properly so the system software
   must read the discs directly to verify media changes.

<LI>While attempting to access a compact disc in an IDE/ATAPI CD-ROM
   Changer, the system may indicate the device is not ready.  If this
   occurs, press the Retry button several times. The compact disc should
   become available after several retries.

<LI>Accessing multiple compact discs simultaneously in a CD-Changer device
   is not recommended. The application may hang or you may experience
   performance loss accessing data.

<LI>Attaching CD-Changers, CD-ROMs, and Removable Media SCSI devices
   requires system reboot for these devices to be detected by system.
<P>
</UL><h3>Removable Media</h3>
 
<P>
IDE removable media cannot be ejected by using some external utilities. Re-
inserting or swapping  the media can cause system to crash.
<P>
Eject all removable media using only the Explorer. Ejecting media by other
means, such as eject switch on the drive, can cause data inconsistency when
viewing media information.
<P>
Data on write protected NTFS media cannot be seen.
<P>
<P><h2>Compaq LS-120</h2>
 
<P>
When formatting a 1.44 MB floppy disk in a Compaq LS-120 drive, the
progress indicator in the dialog box lags behind the formatting activity.
After a minute or so, the progress indicator advances quickly and the
format completes successfully.
<P>
<P><h2>Creative Labs Sound Blaster on RISC Platforms</h2>
 
<P>
If you are running Windows NT on a RISC platform with a Creative Labs Sound
Blaster adapter card, you may experience problems (such as loss of sound)
if you click Settings ,and then click Cancel in the property dialog box of
the sound card. To avoid this, click OK instead of Cancel.
<P>
To restore sound:

<OL><P><LI>Double-click the Multimedia icon in Control Panel
</OL>2. Click the Devices tab.
3. Click Audio Devices, and select Audio for Creative Labs Sound Blaster.
4. Click Remove and then shut down and restart the computer.
5. Double-click the Multimedia icon in Control Panel.
6. Click the Devices tab and then click  Add
7. Select the Creative Labs Sound Blaster driver, verify the settings, and
<PRE>   then click OK.
</PRE></OL>8. Restart your system.
<P>
<P><h2>Device Driver Load Order</h2>
 
<P>
Third-party modifications to the load order of device drivers are not
preserved on a system upgrade. If a device (such as an optical disk) is not
operating correctly after a system upgrade, you may be required to
reinstall the driver.
<P>
<P><h2>DPT Configuration Tool for MIPS and PowerPC Machines</h2>
 
<P>
On DPT's PCI bus adapters, the DPT Configuration tool is built into the
adapter's firmware and on x86 processor-based computers, is accessible by
pressing CTRL-D during boot. This toolcontrols the adapter's I/O address,
parity, PCI transfer/burst, SCSI ID, termination, termination power, and
several other adapter options.
<P>
To configure DPT's PCI bus adapters when installed in either a MIPS or a
PowerPC RISC processor-based computer, DPT has placed these functions in
special versions of their Storage Manager tool software. To obtain this
software, it may be downloaded through DPT's BBS number or their Internet
FTP Site.
<P>
BBS procedure:

<OL><P><LI>Dial in at (407) 831-6432 or (407) 830-1070

<P>
<P><h2>El Torito (no emulation) Bootable CD-ROM Format</h2>
 
<P>
If your computer's BIOS does not support the El Torito (no emulation)
bootable CD-ROM format, you might get an error when you boot up your
machine with the Windows NT compact disc inserted in the CD drive. To work
around this problem, remove the CD-ROM from the drive and reboot the
machine.
<P>
<P><h2>ESDI Disk Drives with More Than 1024 Cylinders</h2>
 
<P>
In some cases, on disk drives with more than 1024 cylinders, Windows NT
installation proceeds normally until the first startup from the hard drive
where Windows NT is installed. The Windows NT Boot Loader will load various
files and then produce a Fatal System Error: 0x0000006b with the message
that Phase 1 Process Initialization Failed. Following this message will be
some type of hexadecimal dump, and the system will be locked up. If you
experience this difficulty, the following information can help.
<P>
Microsoft has tested the ESDI controllers listed in README.WRI by using a
hard drive with a capacity exceeding 516 MB (MB=1,048,576 bytes) formatted.
The MS-DOS limit of 1024 cylinders creates a situation where special BIOS
mapping on the controller is used to change the geometry of the drive. ESDI
drives can be prepared with various values of sectors per track (spt) such
as 53 or 63 spt geometry during a low-level format, as shown in the
following example:

<UL><LI>1024 cylinders x 15 heads x 53 spt x 512 bytes per sector = 398 MB
   formatted capacity
<P>
   -or–

<LI>1024 cylinders x 15 heads x 63 spt x 512 bytes per sector = 472 MB
   formatted capacity
<P>
</UL>Using 63 spt yields 74 MB more space. Windows NT is perfectly compatible
with either geometry and, depending on the drive or controller, can access
the cylinders beyond 1024. This space can be partitioned and formatted—but
not accessed—by MS-DOS. However, some controllers can successfully remap
the remaining cylinders beyond 1024 so that either MS-DOS or Windows NT can
use the entire capacity. For example:
<P>
<PRE>   1632 cylinders x 15 heads x 53 spt x 512 bytes per sector = 634 MB
   formatted capacity

</PRE></OL><h2>External Cache Option</h2>
 
<P>
If you have a system without any external cache on the system board but the
option is turned on in CMOS, Windows NT may not restart when you click
Start, click Shutdown, click Restart the computer, and then click Yes. If
this problem occurs, turn off the external cache option in your CMOS
configuration program.
<P>
<P><h2>IDE Devices in Control Panel SCSI Devices</h2>
 
<P>
On PCI bus computers and computers with ATAPI (IDE) CD-ROM, tape, or
removable disk drives, you see either some or all of the IDE devices on
your computer in the SCSI Devices option in Control Panel.
<P>
<P><h2>Intel EtherExpress 16 LAN Adapter</h2>
 
<P>
In some cases, selecting Early in the I/O Channel Ready box prevents the
network adapter card from functioning correctly. The card must then be
reconfigured with the Intel SoftSet tool. If you are unsure whether your
system can take advantage of this network setting, consult your hardware
vendor.
<P>
<P><h2>Interrupt Conflicts</h2>
 
<P>
A common problem in a computer with several supported devices is
conflicting interrupts, I/O ports, or memory usage. Where possible, such
cases are identified in this document. However, if one of the supported
devices does not seem to work, it might be due to the particular hardware
configuration. For more specific information, see your hardware manual or
contact your system manufacturer.
<P>
<P><h2>Installing Mwave Drivers for the IBM Thinkpad</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Windows NT version 4.0 compact disc contains Mwave audio and
FAX modem drivers for Mwave-based IBM Thinkpad systems. However, the
Windows NT version 4.0 Setup program does not install the drivers by
default. To install the Mwave drivers on your Mwave-based Thinkpad system,
see the procedures that follow.
<P>
This version of the Mwave driver supports audio playback. There are known
problems with recording audio data.  Recording controls are not functional
using Volume Control (accessed by clicking Start, pointing to Programs,
Accessories, and then Multimedia) and recording using either the built-in
or external microphone does not operate properly.
<P>
NOTE: Please consult the release notes (README.TXT) for Mwave audio and FAX
modem drivers before installation. This file is located on the Windows NT
version 4.0 compact disc in the \DRVLIB\MWAVE\THINKPAD\DISK1 directory. It
is important that you print and read this information before you install
the Mwave drivers.
<P>
To install Mwave driver for audio and FAX modem:

<OL><P><LI>Insert the Windows NT compact disc in the CD-ROM drive.
</OL>2. Click Start and then click Run.
3. Type &lt;compact disc drive letter&gt;:\DRVLIB\MWAVE\THINKPAD\DISK1\SETUP and
<PRE>   then click OK.
</PRE></OL>4. Follow the on-screen instructions.
5. When prompted, click Restart Now to reboot your computer.
<P>
After restarting Windows NT, install the MIDI wave-table data to enable
Mwave to play MIDI files:

<OL><P><LI>Click Start and then click Run.
</OL>2. Type &lt;compact disc drive letter&gt;:\DRVLIB\MWAVE\MIDISAMP\SETUP and then
<PRE>   click OK.
</PRE></OL>3. Follow the on-screen instructions.
4. When prompted, click Restart Now to reboot your computer.
5. After restarting Windows NT, follow the instructions in the README.TXT
<PRE>   file to configure your Mwave modem. If you do not configure your modem
   using these instructions, it is likely the modem will not function
   properly under Windows NT.

</PRE><h2>Installing IBM Thinkpad Utilities for Windows NT</h2>
 
<P>
In addition to the Windows NT 4.0 compact disc, you may need the IBM
Thinkpad Utilities diskette for Windows NT. If you want to view or change
your hardware configuration settings, you can obtain the IBM Thinkpad
Utilities diskette from one of the following locations. These changes are
referred to in README.TXT in the \DRVLIB\MWAVE\THINKPAD\DISK1 directory.
<P>
<PRE>   On the Internet:  <B><A href="http://www.pc.ibm.com/support/tps/winnt.html">http://www.pc.ibm.com/support/tps/winnt.html</A></B>
                     <B>ftp://ftp.pc.ibm.com/pub/mobiles</B>

   On CompuServe: GO Thinkpad

   On PC Co. BBS: 919-517-0001, area 37

</PRE>To install the IBM Thinkpad Utilities for Windows NT, follow the
installation instructions described in the README.TXT file included on the
IBM Thinkpad Utilities diskette.
<P>
<P><h2>PCMCIA Cards</h2>
 
<P>
PCMCIA cards are supported in Windows NT version 4.0. For a list of
supported cards and a list of compatible notebook computers, see the
Hardware Compatibility List.
<P>
When using PCMCIA devices, such as modems and network cards on a computer
running Windows NT Workstation, power management features on the computer
system should be turned off. Consult the manufacturer's system manual for
procedures to disable power management.
<P>
<P><h3>PCMCIA SCSI Cards</h3>
 
<P>
On PCMCIA SCSI cards at least one of the devices on the SCSI bus needs to
supply termination power for proper operation.
<P>
<P><h2>PCMCIA Notes</h2>
 
<P>
If the PCMCIA controller was not present when you installed Windows NT, use
the Devices icon in Control Panel to change the startup type to Manual.
Double-click Devices, and select Pcmcia. Click Startup and then click
Manual.
<P>
<P><h3>PCMCIA Atdisk and drive letters</h3>
 
<P>
In some instances the driver letter for the PCMCIA harddisk can become C:.
If this is causing you problems, change the drive letter assignment using
Disk Administrator.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Interrupt Conflicts</h3>
 
<P>
If you have an IRQ conflict, the information that follows includes a few
workarounds.
<P>
NOTE: PCMCIA net device resources can be changed by using the PC Card or
Network icon in Control Panel.
<P>
For modems, try disabling one of the COM ports in you systems BIOS. This
will make PCMCIA enable the PCMCIA modem at a different IRQ.
<P>
If you have Windows NT installed on a laptop and need to install the Elnk3
or Ne2000 driver and your system does not have a CD-ROM drive or is not
connected to a network, you can access the drivers by copying the Elnk3.sys
or Ne2000.sys driver to the root of C:. When prompted for the path to the
driver, type in "C:\".
<P>
<P><h2>PCI Notebook Computers and PCMCIA Hard Disks</h2>
 
<P>
If you have a notebook computer that uses a PCI bus (Compaq Elite 5x00 or
HP Omnibook 5000), you will need to disable Atapi.sys to run PCMCIA hard
disks in your system. This can be done by changing the boot setting for
ATAPI in the Devices icon in Control Panel and restarting the system. To
allow IDE CD-ROM drives to work properly, enable Atapi.sys. To allow the
PCMCIA hard disks to work properly, disable Atapi.sys.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>Plug and Play ISA Device Installation and PNPISA.SYS</h2>
 
<P>
Installation of Plug and Play ISA (PnP ISA) devices under Windows NT
version 4.0 requires an enabler driver that recognizes how to locate and
configure those devices. The driver, PNPISA.SYS, is in the \Drvlib folder
on the Windows NT version 4.0 compact disc. For information about how to
install the enabler, see "Installing PNPISA.SYS if not Enabled" later in
this document.
<P>
The enabler does not contain complete Windows 95 Plug and Play support.
For example, the enabler does not dynamically allocate resources for PnP
ISA devices. It does, however, enable a user interface (UI) that allows you
to manually select system resources that do not conflict with other devices
in the system.
<P>
<P><h3>PnP ISA Enabler, Present on Shipped Computers</h3>
 
<P>
Some computer manufacturers who provide PnP ISA devices with their products
enable PNPISA.SYS at the factory.  In this case, the devices that came
installed in the computer may be configured by the manufacturer.  If new
PnP ISA devices are added later, you can configure the new devices when the
New Hardware Found dialog box appears.
<P>
<P><h3>Installing PNPISA.SYS if not Enabled</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Insert the Windows NT version 4.0 compact disc into the CD-ROM drive.
</OL>2. In the Windows NT Explorer, switch to the CD-ROM drive.
3. Go to the  \DRVLIB\PNPISA\&lt;platform&gt; directory (where &lt;platform&gt; is
<PRE>   either "X86", "MIPS", "ALPHA", or "PPC", depending on your computer's
   platform).
</PRE></OL>4. Right-click PNPISA.INF, and click Install. If Hide file extensions for
<PRE>   known file types (accessed by clicking Options on the View menu) is
   selected, the filename is displayed as PNPISA.
</PRE>5. When prompted, restart your computer.
<P>
<P><h3>Disabling PNPISA.SYS</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Double-click the Devices icon in Control Panel.
</OL>2. Select PnP ISA Enabler Driver and click Startup.
3. Click Disabled and then click OK.
<P>
<P><h3>Installing PnP ISA Devices</h3>
 
<P>
When the system boots with the enabler driver (PNPISA.SYS) installed, the
enabler locates all PnP ISA devices in the computer and enables those
devices for which you have selected resources. Any new devices are
recognized, so that drivers for the devices can be installed when you log
onto the computer as a user with administrative privilege. At logon,
Windows NT displays a New Hardware Found dialog box for each new device it
locates.
<P>
NOTE: Some PnP ISA cards contain multiple functions. In this case, a dialog
box will be displayed for each function on the card.
<P>
If Windows NT does not have a driver that is an exact match for a device, a
dialog box containing the following options is displayed:

<UL><LI>Windows NT default driver:
<P>
   If Windows NT has a driver that is compatible with your device, this
   selection will be enabled.  If you do not have a vendor-supplied driver
   for the device, and this option is available, you should select it.

<LI>Driver from disk provided by hardware manufacturer:
<P>
   If you have a disk that contains a driver for your device, select this
   option. Insert the disk in the drive and a list of the drivers on the
   disk is displayed. Select the model that matches your device to install
   it. In general, the driver disk you supply must contain support for
   Windows NT (a disk for Windows 95 only will not work). However, in the
   case of PnP ISA modems, Windows 95 driver disks can be used. However,
   certain functions, such as VoiceView, will not work.

<LI>Do not install a driver (Windows NT will not prompt you again):
<P>
   Select this option only if you do not have a driver for the device. This
   keeps Windows NT from displaying the New Hardware Found dialog box for
   the device in the future.
<P>
   ************************************************************************
   WARNING: If you select this option, you will not be able to install the
   device at a later time, unless you perform the following procedure:
<P>
   1. Shut down Windows NT.
   2. Remove the card from the computer.
   3. Restart Windows NT. Windows NT detects that the card has been removed
<P><PRE>      from the machine, and removes the entry for the card from the
      registry.
</PRE>   4. Shut down Windows NT.
   5. Reinsert the card.
   6. Restart the computer. When you log on, the New Hardware Found dialog
<P><PRE>      box is displayed for the device.
</PRE>   ************************************************************************

<LI>Select from a list of alternate drivers:
<P>
   If you do not have an INF file for the device, and if the Windows NT
   default driver option is not enabled, you can use this option to attempt
   to locate a compatible device in the list of devices supported by
   Windows NT.  After you click Select from a list of alternate drivers, a
   list of device types is displayed.  Select the type that corresponds to
   your device, and then click OK.
<P>
   If you are not sure about the device type, click Other devices to
   display a list of all supported devices.
<P>
   The Select From A List Of Alternate Drivers option is particularly
   useful for PnP ISA modems. Even if you do not have an INF that matches
   your particular modem, you can select a generic modem (for example
   "Standard 28800 bps Modem"), and you will be able to use the device.
<P>
</UL><h3>Configuring PnP ISA Devices</h3>
 
<P>
After selecting the device that you want to install (or after automatic
selection, if Windows NT has an exact match), you may be presented with
additional dialog boxes requesting configuration information for the
device.  The following examples illustrate the type of user input typically
required.

<UL><LI>PnP ISA modems and PnP ISA serial port devices:
<P>
   Both of these devices are configured using the Advanced Port Settings
   dialog box. Use this dialog box to select the interrupt request and
   input/output range resources for the underlying serial port, and
   configure the COM port number and FIFO settings.  After the devices are
   installed, Advanced Port Settings can be accessed using the Ports icon
   in Control Panel. Select the COM port, click Settings, and then click
   Advanced.

<LI>PnP ISA multimedia cards:
<P>
   For these devices, each different multimedia device can present a
   different dialog box. For example, the Creative Labs SoundBlaster16
   driver displays a property page with only a General tab. (Other
   multimedia device property pages could have additional tabs on them.)
   When you click Settings, you can select an interrupt, input/output
   ranges, and direct memory access (DMA) channels. To access the property
   page for any multimedia device, double-click the Multimedia icon in
   Control Panel. Click the Devices tab, and then select the PnP ISA device
   in the Multimedia devices box. Click Properties and then click
   Settings.
<P>
   For more information about installing a Creative Labs SoundBlaster16
   Plug and Play driver, see the DRVLIB\AUDIO\SBPNP\README.TXT file.
<P>
</UL><h3>Removing PnP ISA Devices</h3>
 
<P>
To remove a PnP ISA device, you must use one of  the Control Panel icons.
For example, to remove a PnP ISA modem or serial port, use the Ports icon
in Control Panel. To remove a multimedia PnP ISA device, use the Multimedia
icon in Control Panel.
<P>
<P><h2>PnP ISA SCSI</h2>
 
<P>
A Plug and Play SCSI adapter that has been installed during Windows NT
Setup will be redetected after Plug and Play ISA enabler is installed on
the system. When the New Hardware Found dialog box is displayed, you are
prompted to either keep the existing driver or install a new driver by
specifying a driver location. Click Yes to keep the existing driver.
<P>

<P><h2>Running Windows NT version 4.0 on PCI Bus Systems</h2>
 
<P>
To run Windows NT version 4.0 on a PCI bus system, you may need to enable
the interrupts via the CMOS screen or by switching jumpers on the
motherboard. Refer to system documentation to determine how to enable
interrupts for your system.
<P>
<P><h2>Windows NT SCSI Driver Changes</h2>
 
<P>
With the release of Windows NT version 4.0, the drivers for certain SCSI
adapters have been moved from the base operating system to the Windows NT
Driver Library (\DRVLIB) included on the Windows NT version 4.0 compact
disc. Check the following list to determine if any of your adapters are
affected by this change. If your computer has an adapter that appears on
this list, you must create a driver disk before installing Windows NT
version 4.0. Use this disk to install the appropriate driver(s) during
Setup, or keep the disk handy and install the driver by using Control Panel
once Setup is complete.
<P>
The following drivers have been moved:
<P>
<PRE>   always.sys
   dtc329x.sys
   t128.syst13b.sys
   tmv1.sys
   ultra124.sys
   wd33c93.sys

</PRE></OL>The following adapters are affected by this change:

information on these storage adapters.
<P>
To create a driver disk for drivers that have been moved to the Driver
Library
 

<OL><P><LI>Create a blank formatted 3.5-inch disk.
</OL>2. Copy all files from the following directory to the blank disk:
<P>
<PRE>      \drvlib\storage\retired\&lt;CPU_TYPE&gt;

   where CPU_TYPE is X86 if you are using a machine with an x86-based
   processor; MIPS if your computer uses a MIPS RISC processor; or ALPHA if
   your computer uses a Digital Alpha processor. For enabler drivers, copy
   the files from the \Drvlib\storage\fenb directory.
</PRE></OL>3. Write "Drivers disk" on the disk.
<P>
<P><h3>To install drivers from the driver disk during Windows NT version 4.0 Setup</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start Windows NT Setup. During the course of  Setup, a message appears
   stating "Setup has recognized the following mass storage devices in your
   computer."
</OL>2. When prompted, press S to skip detection, then press S again to display
<PRE>   a list of supported SCSI host adapters.
</PRE></OL>3. Select Other from the bottom of the list.
4. Insert the disk labled "Drivers Disk" when you are prompted to do so,
<PRE>   and select your host adapter from this list.

</PRE>Windows NT will now recognize any devices attached to this adapter. Repeat
this step for each host adapter not already recognized by Windows NT Setup.
<P>
To install drivers when Setup recognizes one of the supported SCSI host
adapters without making the devices attached to it available for use
 

<OL><P><LI>Restart Windows NT Setup.
</OL>2. When Windows NT Setup displays the message "Setup is inspecting your
<PRE>   computer's hardware configuration...," press F6. This prevents Windows
   NT Setup from performing disk controller detection and allows you to
   install the driver from the "Drivers Disk" you created. Note that all
   SCSI adapters will have to be installed manually.
</PRE></OL>3. When Windows NT Setup displays the message "Setup could not determine
<PRE>   the type of one or more mass storage devices installed in your system,
   or you have chosen to manually specify an adapter," press S to display a
   list of supported SCSI host adapters.
</PRE>4. Select Other from the bottom of the list.
5. Insert the "Drivers Disk" when prompted to do so, and select your host
<PRE>   adapter from this list. Note that in some cases, Windows NT Setup will
   repeatedly prompt you to swap disks.

</PRE>Windows NT will now recognize any devices attached to this adapter. Repeat
this step for each host adapter not already recognized by Windows NT Setup.

<P>
<P><h2>SCSI Device Interrogation Tool (SCSItool)</h2>
 
<P>
SCSItool detects SCSI adapters and the devices connected to the adapters.
SCSItool helps Microsoft Answer Point and Enterprise Customer Unit (Product
Support) personnel identify installed SCSI devices for diagnostic purposes
when a system does not start or becomes unstable.  SCSItool must be run
using a SCSItool boot floppy disk.
<P>
The following adapters are supported:
<P>
<PRE>   Adaptec PCI, ISA, and EISA
   BusLogic PCI, EISA, and ISA

</PRE><h3>System Requirements</h3>
 
<P>
12MB RAM
486 processor
VGA monitor
3.5 inch 1.44 MB drive
<P>
<P><h3>To create a SCSItool disk</h3>
 
<P>
Run Makedisk.bat from the \support\scsitool folder on the Windows NT
Workstation or Windows NT Server compact disc.
<P>
Makedisk.bat creates a bootable floppy disk that you can use to start your
computer and automatically run the diagnostic tool.
<P>
<P><h3>To start SCSItool</h3>
 
<P>
Insert the SCSItool disk in drive A and then restart the system.
<P>
SCSItool will do the following:
<UL><LI>Create a 4MB RAM drive
<LI>Detect the RAM drive letter
<LI>Copy Scsizip.exe to the RAM drive
<LI>Self-extract Scsizip.exe.
<LI>Start Scsi.exe
<LI>Log adapters and devices data into a log file called Scsi.txt
<P>
<P>
<PRE>                            Video Notes

</PRE></UL><h2>Cirrus Logic</h2>
 
<P>
Some computers with the Cirrus 543x video chipset may experience problems
when attempting to restart. When restart is selected, the system may freeze
when attempting to reset the Cirrus video. This is not detrimental to the
system. Simply restart the computer using the reset button or power off the
computer.
<P>
<P><h2>Direct Draw</h2>
 
<P>
The version of Direct Draw provided with this release of Windows NT is
fully compatible with the version released on Windows 95 in the DirectX 2
release.  The only difference between these two versions is that the
Windows NT version does not support ModeX low resolution modes.
<P>
<P><h3>Low resolution modes</h3>
 
<P>
The Tseng ET6000 supports display modes which are lower resolution than
640x480.  No other driver currently supports low resolution modes and this
version of Direct Draw does not support ModeX modes.  Applications that
require low resolution modes will not run on non-ET6000 systems.
<P>
<P><h3>DXSetup</h3>
 
<P>
The dxsetup program used by DirectX 1 games to install the DirectX
components on Windows 95 does not work properly on Windows NT.
Applications that use this setup program will not install correctly on
Windows NT. The dxsetup program supplied with the DirectX 2 SDK will work
correctly on Windows NT.
<P>
<P><h3>Video cards with hardware acceleration</h3>
 
<P>
The following video cards have drivers which contain DirectDraw support in
this release. Systems with video cards other than the ones on this list are
still able to run DirectDraw applications but no hardware acceleration is
provided.
<PRE>   x86
   ATI Mach64, Mach32
   S3 Trio64V+, Trio64V2
   S3 868, 968
   Matrox Millennium
   Tseng ET6000
   Mips
   S3 868, 968, Trio64V+ (some Mips machines either does not support these
      cards, or will not DirectDraw accelerated)
   PPC
   S3 868, 968, Trio64V+
   Matrox Millennium (the Millennium doesn't work in some IBM PPC machines)
   Alpha
   Matrox Millennium


</PRE><h2>S3</h2>
 
<P>
Some computers using the S3 chipsets will not display 1152x864 resolutions.
These machines do not support the S3 1152 BIOS Standard. Set the resolution
to another mode.
<P>
Due to differences in BIOS mode tables, some S3 cards will not correctly
set the proper refresh rate. Contact your video card manufacturer for an
updated driver.
<P>
<P><h2>S15</h2>
 
<P>
The S15 video card does not display colors correctly on the IBM P70, the
IBM 21P, and the Iiyama monitors. There are two models of the P70.
The P70 which displays colors incorrectly has a switch on the back labeled
"normal" and "adjust". The switch is typically in the "normal"
position.  Switching it to the "adjust" position will resolve the color
problem. The color problem does not appear in the model of the P70 that
does not have the normal/adjust switch.
<P>
There is no known workaround for the IBM 21P and Iiyama monitors.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>Matrox</h2>
 
<P>
Video cards with the Matrox Atlas chipset may show text corruption during
interlaced modes.
<P>
Compaq Q-Vision 2000 and Matrox Impression Lite Rev E boards are affected.
Set the refresh rate in Control Panel, Display to a non-interlaced setting.
Some systems with a Matrox Impression Plus 4MB video card in high
resolution modes may show a cursor 'ghost' (a copy of the mouse pointer an
inch away from the usual pointer).
<P>
The Matrox driver conflicts with some Token ring cards in Compaq computers.
The conflict causes the network card to fail at startup. Contact Compaq for
an updated driver.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>VDM (Virtual DOS Machine)</h2>
 
<P>
Some CGA (color graphics adapter) and EGA (enhanced graphics adapter) MS-
DOS applications may experience palette corruption after several successive
screen switches.
<P>
<P><h2>Weitek</h2>
 
<P>
Video cards with the Weitek P9100 video chipset may display offset or
changing colors. These color palette changes occur when the video color
depth is set to 256 colors (8 bit). To resolve this, set color depth higher
than 256 colors (16, 24 or 32 bit).
