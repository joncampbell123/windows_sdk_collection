The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system, version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
To display Performance Monitor statistics, such as % Processor Time, for
two instances of the same program, you must copy the program to another
name on your hard disk.
<P>
For example, consider a program called TESTDEMO.EXE that calls various GDI
functions based on a menu selection. To chart the performance of two
different instances of the application simultaneously to see how the
different functions use the processor, make a copy of the program with a
different name (for example, TESTDEM1.EXE).
<P>
If the program is a 16-bit Windows-based application, Windows NT does
not support profiling more than one copy simultaneously. Only one
instance of the NTVDM exists at any one time. Windows NT cooperatively
multitasks all 16-bit Windows-based applications in the NTVDM and they
all appear to the Win32 Subsystem as one process. Because the
Performance Monitor is a Win32 application, it only sees the one NTVDM
process and it cannot separate the performance of the individual
16-bit Windows-based applications.
<P>
This behavior is necessary because process identifier values are quickly
reused. If a process ID was chosen as a unique value and the process died,
another program might use that process ID almost immediately.
<P>
For example, consider a process with Process ID 112. If you chart the
performance of this process, stop the process and restart it, it may
restart with a different process number and the Performance Monitor would
not display it.
<P>
To view statistics for two processes simultaneously, give each process a
unique name. Then the Performance Monitor can provide statistics for each
process no matter how many times the process starts and stops.
