The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The About Program Manager dialog box in Windows NT shows the total
physical memory installed in the system, but not the free memory or
the percentage of free system resources, which are both displayed by
Windows 3.0 and 3.1. This is because Windows NT uses resources
differently than do Windows 3.0 and 3.1.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Because Windows NT allocates all physical memory for itself, showing
free physical memory would be misleading. Similarly, showing free
virtual memory would be misleading because every running application
always has close to 2 gigabytes (2048 MB) of memory free. When an
application starts, Windows NT allots it 2 gigabytes (GB) of virtual
memory. Windows NT then uses a method of memory allocation called
"paging" to redirect physical memory into each application's virtual
memory. Windows NT often allocates all physical memory because it
makes the process of memory paging more efficient.
<P>
To see how Windows NT is using memory, use Performance Monitor (in the
Administrative Tools group). Keep in mind that having very little free
physical memory is not an indication of a problem. Under Windows 3.0
or 3.1, when you are about to start a new application, you may check
free memory and system resources before doing so. However, due to the
new memory-management schemes for Windows NT, there is almost no need
to be concerned about free memory before starting another application.
If Windows NT needs more physical memory, it can quickly redirect
memory pages so that every application gets the resources and
performance it needs.
