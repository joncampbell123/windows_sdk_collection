<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In a network where you are seeding the network and are running Windows NT
Advanced Server Services for Macintosh, be very cautious of the order in
which the network hardware is initialized. A device, such as the Shiva
NetModem, which has the capability of seeding a AppleTalk network can keep
other seed routing devices on the network from seeding properly.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
One problem that may occur is when your whole network is powered down, but
a seeding device, such as the Shiva NetModem, is left running or is powered
on first. This causes other seed routers on the network to see that the
NetModem is seeding the network. They then gather the seed information that
the NetModem is sending out, which may or may not have the correct network
zones or network ranges created. The result of this is that other seed
routers on the network do not start unless their seed routing information
matches the Shiva NetModem's seed routing information. To keep this from
happening, make sure that the device that has the correct seed routing
information for your network is powered on first.
