<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Apple has a version of their TCP/IP client called "Open Transport" that is DHCP compatible. Open Transport 1.1 is available separately or as part of System 7.5.3. This version does not, however, provide WINS compatibility.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
On March 11, 1996, Apple released Open Transport 1.1, a Dynamic Host
Configuration Protocol(DHCP) compatible TCP/IP stack for specific Macintosh
models. Release notes from Apple list Windows NT as a compatible DHCP
Server.
<P>
From Apple's release notes:
<P>
<PRE>   Q: Which DHCP servers are supported by Open Transport/TCP?

   A: Apple's implementation conforms to the current versions of the
   applicable specification documents (RFCs). To date, Open Transport/TCP
   has been tested with the following DHCP server implementations:

      *Competitive Automation, *FTP Software (<B><A href="http://www.ftp.com)">http://www.ftp.com),</A></B>
      *Hewlett Packard HP-UX (<B><A href="http://www.hp.com)">http://www.hp.com),</A></B>
      *Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server,
      *Silicon Graphics (<B><A href="http://www.sgi.com)">http://www.sgi.com),</A></B>
      *Sun Solaris and SunOS (<B><A href="http://www.sun.com)">http://www.sun.com),</A></B>
      *TGV (<B><A href="http://www.tgv.com)">http://www.tgv.com).</A></B>

   Q: Can Open Transport/TCP act as a DHCP client to a Windows NT
   Advanced Server?

   A: Yes. With Open Transport v1.1, MacOS clients are fully interoperable
   with the Windows NTAS DHCP server. Macintosh clients running earlier
   versions of Open Transport (1.0.x) could experience some of the
   following interoperability problems due to differences between the
   Microsoft implementation and that of a typical UNIX server.

</PRE>*Clients running Open Transport v1.0 or v1.0.1 were not able to acquire
leased IP addresses. This was due to unusually long reply- time-out values
used in the NTAS implementation. Open Transport v1.0.6 was changed to
accommodate NTAS behavior in this regard.
<P>
*Clients running Open Transport versions prior to v1.0.8 would be
incompletely configured via DHCP.
<P>
Windows NT Advanced Server (NTAS) sends only IP address, IP address lease
information, the configuring server's IP address, and a subnet mask. Other
configuration options entered in the Windows NT DHCP server's database
(default gateway address, domain name server addresses, domain name,
broadcast address, and so forth) were not sent unless specifically
requested by the client using the DHCP Parameter Request List option.
<P>
Apple believes that requiring use of this option in order for the client to
be properly configured is contrary to the DHCP server specification
described in RFC 1541, and it appears to be unique to the NTAS
implementation. However, in the interest of interoperability, Open
Transport v1.0.8 and v1.1 use the Parameter Request List option to request
default gateways, DNS servers, domain name, subnet mask, and broadcast
address. This permits Open Transport/TCP clients to be fully configured by
these servers, at the expense of a few additional packets on the wire
during the initialization phase.
<P>
Q: Can Open Transport/TCP act as a WINS client to a Windows NT
Advanced Server?
<P>
A: No, not at this time. The Microsoft WINS server is dependent on
Microsoft extensions to TCP/IP (requiring NetBIOS support) that
provide some automation for assignment and registration of IP host
and domain names.
<P>
The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is developing a cross-
platform industry standard technology for dynamic registration and
look-up of IP names through the Dynamic Service Location working group.
<P>
Apple has no current plans to implement the WINS extensions. Instead,
we are fully committed to implementation of the applicable IETF
standards as they emerge. We welcome customer feedback on this topic -
should sufficient demand for a WINS client materialize, we'd be open to
exploring this issue. A future MacOS WINS client would be dependent
upon Microsoft releasing sufficient technical detail regarding their
proprietary extensions to IP to make an interoperable implementation
possible.
<P>
<P>
Q: Does System 7.1.x support both classic and Open Transport
networking?
<P>
A: System 7.1.x continues to support classic networking, and gains
the option of running Open Transport v1.1.
<P>
Customers running 7.1.x on 68000 and 68020 systems will continue to
use classic networking; Open Transport v1.1 will not install on these
systems. (System 7.1.x does not support PCI MacOS systems.) Customers
running System 7.1.x on 68030, 68040, and NuBus PowerPC MacOS systems
can use either classic or Open Transport networking. To enable Open
Transport, users must run the Open Transport installer, available as
a part of the stand-alone retail distribution package.
<P>
Q: Is the Network Software Selector available for System 7.1.x
customers?
<P>
A: No, the Network Software Selector is a feature only found in
System 7.5.3.
<P>
Availability and Distribution
<P>
Q: How is Open Transport v1.1 available?
<P>
A: Open Transport v1.1 is available through a broad range of
distribution channels:
<P>
*as a no-charge upgrade to customers with existing MacTCP volume
license software maintenance agreements;
*as a no-charge upgrade to customers with existing system software
volume license software maintenance agreements;
*as a component of MacOS system software release System 7.5.3;
*as a component of MacOS system software update System 7.5 System
Update 2.0;
*as a retail software product in single-user software package;
*through an OEM redistribution licensing program from Apple Software
Licensing,
*bundled with Apple and third party applications software that are Open
Transport-ready; and,
*from select Apple-licensed publishers and Internet Service Providers.
<P>
Q: How could a customer receive a copy of System 7.5.3?
<P>
A: System 7.5.3 will be pre-installed on MacOS systems beginning in
first half calendar 1996. System 7.5.3 will also become available
as a shrink-wrap retail product in first half calendar 1996.
<P>
Q: How could a customer receive a copy System 7.5 System Update 2.0?
<P>
A: System 7.5 System Update 2.0 is available through a variety of
channels, including:
<P>
*On the Internet, from locations including www.info.apple.com,
www.support.apple.com, ftp.info.apple.com, and ftp.suport.apple.com;
*On electronic information services such as eWorld, America Online, and
CompuServe;
*Through Apple User Groups; and,
*From the Apple Order Center, in floppy or CD update kits. The update is
available at no charge plus $13 shipping and handling. Call U.S.
+1 (800) 293-6617, ext. 984 to order.
