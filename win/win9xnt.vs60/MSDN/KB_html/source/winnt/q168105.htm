<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you start Windows NT from a different SCSI logical unit number (LUN)
other than LUN 0, a memory dump file (memory.dmp) file will not be created.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Diskdump.sys file in Windows NT does not check for any other LUN
besides LUN 0. If the Windows NT computer is started from any other LUN
than 0, this driver will not load, disabling the ability to write a dump
file if the computer traps (displays a blue screen error message).
<P>

<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>

Small Computer System Interface (SCSI)
SCSI is a hardware interface that allows for the connection of up to 15
peripheral devices to a single expansion board that plugs into the computer
called a SCSI host adapter or SCSI controller.
<P>
SCSI devices are daisy chained together. Each device has two ports, one for
the incoming cable and another for the outgoing cable to the next device.
Each device must be set to a unique ID number (SCSI ID), which is normally
done by manually flipping a rotary switch on the device itself. The highest
number has the highest priority. Thus, the host adapter usually defaults to
ID 7 in the case of an 8-device SCSI system.
<P>
Each SCSI device can be further broken up into eight logical units,
identified by logical unit numbers (LUNs) 0 to 7. Although most SCSI disks
contain only one disk inside and are addressed as LUN 0, CD-ROM and optical
disk jukeboxes contain multiple units. Each disk in these devices can be
addressed independently via LUN numbers; for example, a four-disk jukebox
could be assigned LUN 0 to 3. RAID systems are beginning to use multiple
LUN addressing in their fault tolerant disk systems as well.
<P>
On most computers you will not need to worry about LUN addressing since, by
default, most SCSI controllers and devices are set to LUN 0. However, many
of the newer SCSI controllers have the ability to start from LUNs other
than zero (adaptec 2940 allows starting from LUN 0 or 1). You should be
able to detect LUN addressing through the SCSI boot process or by entering
the BIOS of SCSI controller installed on the system.
<P>
Obtaining SCSI Standards reference manuals:
<P>
American National Standard (ANSI) for Small Computer System Interface
(SCSI), X3.131-1986. This approved standard is available from:

</PRE>The Small Computer System Interface - 2 (SCSI-2) was approved by ANSI on
August 31, 1990. Since then, the X3T9.2 committee has asked ANSI to return
SCSI-2 for further editing. Revision 10d is in the works, but it is not
finished yet. Revision 10c can be purchased from:
