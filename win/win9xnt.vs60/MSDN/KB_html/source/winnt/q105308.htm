<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When Windows NT is booted, if an American Power Conversions (APC)
Smart UPS is installed, its battery may be discharged or the UPS
function may be shutdown.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
During the boot sequence, Windows NT writes configuration/detection
code to the COM Port to determine baud rate, FIFO information, and for
mouse detection. The string written to the port may contain the letter
"D," which the Smart UPS interprets as a command to discharge the
battery. The string may also contain the letter "S," which will cause
the Smart UPS to shutdown.
<P>
The Smart UPS interprets the string incorrectly only if it has already
been placed in the "Smart Mode" prior to starting Windows NT. The user
must have already placed the UPS in the Smart Mode using the software
supplied by American Power Conversions; otherwise the Smart UPS will
be unaffected by the signal Windows NT sends to the COM Ports.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
The Smart UPS can be used successfully by temporarily disconnecting
the cable from the COM Port during the Windows NT boot sequence. The
user can also reset (power off, then on) the UPS to return to the
default UPS mode. NOTE: This also has the effect of interrupting power
to the computer.
<P>
American Power Conversions is currently working on a Windows NT driver
that will take full advantage of the Smart UPS unit's capabilities.
<P>
The Smart UPS is manufactured by American Power Conversions, a vendor
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise,
regarding this products' performance or reliability.
