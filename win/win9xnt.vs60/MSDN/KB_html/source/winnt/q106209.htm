<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
During the installation of Windows NT, after you create a local
administrator account, you may be prompted with a Local Account Setup
dialog box giving you the option to create a local user account. The
option to create a local user account during Windows NT Setup will be
offered only if you choose to have your Windows NT machine be a member
of a workgroup. If you choose to be a member of a domain during Setup,
you will not be prompted to create a local account.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
A local account is defined only on the local machine running Windows
NT. If you set up Windows NT so that your machine will not be a member
of a domain, you are given the option to create a local account. This
local account allows you to log on to your Windows NT machine as a
user account other than the built-in Guest or Administrator account.
The local account created during setup will be a member of the local
Administrators group.
<P>
Logon accounts on the Windows NT domain are maintained on the domain
controller. The assumption being made during Windows NT Setup is that
if you choose to include your Windows NT machine in an existing
domain, you will most likely log on to that domain, and the logon will
be validated by a remote server on the domain. Consequently, the need
for creating a local account during Windows NT setup is less of an
issue, because you should already have a valid user account on the
domain that will allow you to log on to your Windows NT machine. You
can use User Manager to create local accounts after you have completed
Setup.
