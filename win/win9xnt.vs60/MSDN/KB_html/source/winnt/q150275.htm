<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
On Windows NT, it is possible for multiple logon sessions to be in progress
simultaneously from a single workstation to a single server, for example an
interactive logon session initiated by the interactive logon user and
another session initiated by a service. These logon sessions are
multiplexed over a single virtual circuit (VC). If a resource is kept open
by the noninteractive session on the server, the server will keep open the
session for the interactive user even after the user has logged off from
the workstation.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When a user logs off, the Rdr.sys checks to see if there is any open
resource for that user. Rdr.sys will close any resources that are open with
the session ID of the currently logged on user and then send a logoff
request to the server; the server will then close the session. However, if
a resource is open on a noninteractive session, Rdr.sys will close the
resources open by the interactive user but will not send a logoff request
to the server. As a result, the session will be kept open for the user on
the server even after the user has logged off.
