<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
A trusting domain shows event log entries indicating trust failure. Or, a
trusting domain doesn't grant appropriate access to accounts on the trusted
domain, or displays accounts on the trusted account as "Account unknown."
<P>
NOTE: It is possible to add accounts from a trusted domain to ACLs or local
groups even when a trust relationship is incomplete or broken because User
Browser can obtain account lists that may work even though the trust
relationship doesn't work.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Trust failure occurs when internal passwords are out of sync. This happens
when:
<P>
One side of the trust relationship is deleted and then recreated after the
trust relationship has gone through one or more automatic password changes.
<P>
<PRE>   -or-

</PRE>The "permit to trust" and "trust" sides of the relationship were initially
set up with different passwords. User Manager for Domains can detect if
this is the case if the "B permits A to trust" side was set up first, but
not if the "A trusts B" side was set up first. (This is why the "B permits
A to trust" side should be set up first, and one reason why User Manager
for Domains sometimes warns that "the trust relationship could not be
verified at this time" when the "A trusts B" side is set up.)
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, check to see that both halves of the trust
relationship exist (A must trust B, and B must permit A to trust). If both
halves of the trust relationship exist, their internal passwords may be out
of sync. If the internal passwords are out of sync, remove both halves, and
then replace them. For information on doing this, see the chapter titled
"User Manager for Domains" of the Windows NT "System Guide." It is
recommended to add the "B permits A to trust" side of the trust
relationship before the "A trusts B" side.
