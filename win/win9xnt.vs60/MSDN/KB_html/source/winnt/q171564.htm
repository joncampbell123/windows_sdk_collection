The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
You may experience a loss of connectivity to computers across the router
when your primary gateway fails, even though your computer running Windows
NT is configured with multiple default gateways for redundancy.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Windows NT 4.0 supports dead gateway detection using the Triggered
Reselection method described in RFC 816. This implementation can cause the
current default gateway to switch to the second or third configured gateway
very easily; however, it does not test the gateway being switched to prior
to making the change.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Obtain the updated file mentioned below or wait for the next service pack.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0.
A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested
and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem.
Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix.
Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The description and explanation of the Windows NT 4.0 dead gateway
detection algorithm follows:

<UL><LI>When any TCP connection that is routed through the default gateway
   has attempted to send a TCP packet to the destination a number
   of times equal to one-half of the registry value
   TcpMaxDataRetransmissions, but receives no response, the algorithm
   advises IP to switch to the next gateway in the list.
<P>
</UL>The new algorithm, however, is more cautious about advising IP to switch
gateways:

<UL><LI>When any TCP connection that is routed through the default gateway has
   attempted to send a TCP packet to the destination a number of times
   equal to one-half of the registry value TcpMaxDataRetransmissions, but
   receives no response, the algorithm changes the Route Cache Entry (RCE)
   for that one remote IP address to use the next default gateway in the
   list. When 25 percent of the TCP connections have moved to the next
   default gateway, the algorithm advises IP to change the default gateway
   for the whole computer to the one that the connections are now using.
<P>
</UL><h3>Example of the New Algorithm</h3>
 
<P>
Assume that there are currently TCP connections to 11 different IP
addresses that are being routed through the default gateway. Now assume
that the default gateway fails, that there is a second default gateway
configured, and that the value for TcpMaxDataRetransmissions is at the
default of 5.
<P>
When the first TCP connection tries to send data, it will not receive any
acknowledgments. After the third retransmission, the RCE for that remote IP
address will be switched to use the next default gateway in the list. At
this point, any TCP connections to that one remote IP address will have
switched over, but the remaining connections will still try to use the
original default gateway.
<P>
When the second TCP connection tries to send data, the same thing will
happen. Now, two of the 11 RCEs will point to the new gateway.
<P>
When the third TCP connection tries to send data, after the third
retransmission, three of 11 RCEs will have been switched to the second
default gateway. Since, at this point, over 25 percent of the RCEs have
been moved, the default gateway for the whole computer will be moved to the
new one.
<P>
At this point, that default gateway remains the primary one for the
computer until it experiences problems (causing the dead gateway algorithm
to try the next one in the list again) or until the computer is restarted.
<P>
When the end of the list of default gateways is reached, the search returns
to the beginning again.
