<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The SNA Server APPC Programmer's Guide, Chapter 1, states that a Windows
APPC application must call WinAPPCStartup at the beginning of the session
to register the application and WinAPPCCleanup at the end of the session
to deregister the application. This article clarifies this requirement,
as well as other related issues. This article also applies to Windows 
CPIC applications required to call the WinCPICStartup and WinCPICCleanup 
functions.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Each Windows (16-bit or 32-bit) task that uses the SNA Server Windows APPC
(or CPIC) interface must first call WinAPPCStartup (or WinCPICStartup). 
Likewise, before ending, the task should call WinAPPCCleanup (or 
WinCPICCleanup) to properly deregister with the Windows APPC (or CPIC) 
interface. The WinAPPCStartup (or WinCPICStartup) and WinAPPCCleanup (or
WinCPICCleanup) calls only need to be called once per task (or Windows 
process). This requirement applies to invoking transaction programs 
(programs that initiate a conversation using the TP_STARTED and 
[MC_]ALLOCATE calls) and invokable transaction programs (programs which
"listen" for conversation startup requests by calling RECEIVE_ALLOCATE).
<P>
Due to a change implemented in SNA Server 2.11, 32-bit Windows APPC
invokable transaction programs that issue RECEIVE_ALLOCATE do not need
to call WinAPPCStartup in order to function. This change was implemented
so that SNA Server APPC API tracing would occur for invokable transaction
programs which don't call WinAPPCStartup before calling RECEIVE_ALLOCATE.
This change does not apply to 16-bit Windows programs. However, it is
recommended that all Windows APPC programs call WinAPPCStartup.
<P>
An APPC application can support multiple APPC transaction programs and
multiple conversations within a single task. The SNA Server Windows 16-bit
APPC interface allows a single task to support up to 16 transaction
programs, and up to 64 conversations. The SNA Server Windows 32-bit APPC
interface allows a single task to support up to 254 transaction programs,
and up to 254 conversations.
<P>
Also, the Windows APPC interface should not be called from the
applications' LibMain() function, DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH, or DLL_PROCESS_DETACH
entry points. Calling APPC functions within these contexts may cause the
application to hang or encounter an application exception, because
underlying SNA Server client DLLs may not be initialized, or may have been
unloaded.
