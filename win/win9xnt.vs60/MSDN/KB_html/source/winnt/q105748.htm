The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Windows NT may occasionally stop responding (hang) when the ALT+F4+F6
keys are pressed simultaneously for a 16-bit Windows-based
application. If these keys are pressed while the application is being
loaded, a system failure may occur. A failure can also occur when you
choose Save As from the File menu and press ALT+F4+F6 when new data
has not been saved. Windows-based applications such as Microsoft Word
for Windows, version 2.0a, and Microsoft Excel can also produce these
failures. This problem is most common on keyboards that have the
function keys located on the left side of the keyboard, in which case,
the F4 and F6 keys may easily be pressed simultaneously by accident.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
WOWEXEC produces a kernel-level failure through the Windows NT 32-bit
subsystem.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
An updated WINSRV.DLL file corrects this problem (on Intel x86
Microsoft Windows NT 3.1 installations). This file is available
through Microsoft Electronic Services including CompuServe (WINNT
forum Library2: Patches and Updates) and the Internet
(GoWinNT.Microsoft.Com: Bussys\winnt\unsup-ed\fixes\WinSrv\*.*). The
file available on these services, WINSRV.EXE, is a self-extracting
archive.
<P>
To replace the WINSRV.DLL file, do the following:
<P>
WARNING: If this file becomes corrupt when installed on NTFS, the
<PRE>         system may fail to start. If possible, test this file on
         a FAT partition of a test system.

</PRE><P><LI>Rename WinNT\System32\WINSRV.DLL *.old.

<P><LI>Copy WINSRV.DLL WinNT\System32.

<P><LI>Shut down the system and then restart it.
<P>
</OL>This replacement file is provided as is, and is not supported by
Microsoft Product Support Services. A tested and supported copy of
this file will be included in an updated Microsoft Windows NT Service
Pack.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Open a document in Word or Excel and leave it blank.

<P><LI>Open a second document and type some text in it.

<P><LI>Press ALT+F4+F6 simultaneously.
<P>
</OL>The system will hang.
