<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Joining a domain during an automated Windows NT Setup may fail in some
instances.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
There are various causes for failures. The most common ones are listed
below:

<OL><P><LI>Problems communicating with a Primary Domain Controller (PDC) during
   Windows NT Setup.

<P><LI>Not creating a new computer account for the system attempting to join
   the domain.

<P><LI>Specifying a Workgroup name as well as a domain name in the answer file.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
You must be able to contact a PDC during Setup if you want to join a
domain. If the PDC is across a router, you will need to use a routable
protocol such as TCP/IP. This may also involve configuring a DHCP Server to
supply a valid WINS Server address or using an LMHOSTS file with #PRE #DOM
statements to assist in resolving Netbios names. For more information on
TCP/IP name resolution, refer to the "Name Resolution for Windows
Networking" section in the TCP/IP manual included with Windows NT Server.
<P>
From Cps.hlp included in the Windows NT Resource Kit:
<P>
<PRE>   If you specify a domain to join, there must be a computer account on the
   server for the domain, and the account must never have been joined to.

</PRE></OL>Another common problem involves the Ntlanman.inf file that is used in
setting up the network, including joining a domain. The issue is that
Ntlanman.inf first attempts to set the Workgroup name by comparing
STF_AUTOWORKGROUP to "" (the empty string). If this is successful the
domain information is ignored. To avoid this issue, modify the
[DefaultValues] section of your answer file (that is, Unattend.txt,
Profile.ini, Defaults.inf) as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   DefaultWorkgroup = ""

</PRE>Do not attempt to comment the line by placing a semicolon in front of
DefaultWorkgroup.
<P>
For more information on automating Windows NT Setup, refer to Volume 1,
Chapter 3 of the Windows NT Resource Kit 3.51.
