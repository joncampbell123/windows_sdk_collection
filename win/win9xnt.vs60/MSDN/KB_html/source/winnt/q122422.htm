The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article provides an example and explanation of the processes involved
with a remote logon.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This example uses the following scenario:
<P>
A network has three workstations, all on the same domain:

<UL><LI>Workstation A is the primary domain controller (PDC) of a domain called
   "Oz."

<LI>Workstation B is a Windows NT Server backup domain controller (BDC).

<LI>Workstation C is a Windows NT Workstation.
<P>
</UL><h3>A User on Workstation C Does an Interactive Logon to the Oz Domain</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>When the user logs on interactively, Winlogon on Workstation C passes
   the user credentials entered in the Winlogon dialog box (Name, Password,
   and in this case, the domain name "Oz") to the Local Security Authority
   (LSA) on Workstation C and asks for an access token in return.

<P><LI>LSA forwards the credentials to the MSV1_0 authentication package on
   Workstation C and asks for the user's account security ID (SID) and
   global SIDs in return.
<P>
   NOTE: When Winlogon called LSA, it specified the MSV1_0 authentication
   package (MSV1_0.DLL) as the authentication package to use to
   authenticate the user and obtain SIDs for the user's access token. This
   is because MSV1_0 understands and can process the type of user
   credentials passed by Winlogon. Some other logon application might
   accept some other form of user credentials (data read by a pass-card
   reader, retina-scan image, and so on) and might therefore specify an
   authentication package other than MSV1_0 that understands and knows how
   to process that form of credentials. For additional information on the
   MSV1_0 authentication package, please see the following article in the
   Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../winnt/q102716.htm">Q102716</A></B>
<PRE></PRE>      TITLE     : User Authentication with Windows NT

</PRE><P><LI>If the From box in the Winlogon dialog box had indicated the local user
   account database (for example, if the user had selected the
   workstation's computer name in the From box), MSV1_0 would proceed to
   call the Security Account Manager (SAM) on the local station
   (Workstation C) to retrieve the account SID and global group SIDs.
<P>
   Because this example indicates that the user selected the domain name
   ("Oz") in the From box on a Windows NT Workstation, this indicates to
   MSV1_0 that the user accounts database from which to obtain the account
   and global group SIDs is not located on the local station. Consequently,
   MSV1_0 calls (and passes the credentials to) the Netlogon service on
   Workstation C.

<P><LI>The Netlogon service on Workstation C considers the domain name "Oz" and
   already knows (from earlier discovery) the computer name of a domain
   controller on the "Oz" domain. With this computer name, Netlogon uses
   Remote Procedure Call (RPC) to forward the credentials to the Netlogon
   service on a domain controller, Workstation B in this example.

<P><LI>The Netlogon service on Workstation B calls MSV1_0 on Workstation B,
   passing the credentials and asking for account and global group SIDs.

<P><LI>MSV1_0 on Workstation B calls (and passes the credentials to) the SAM on
   Workstation B, asking it to use the local (Workstation B) user accounts
   database (data contained in a secured Registry key) to:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Look up the specified user account name, and retrieve the associated
      account SID.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - Compare the specified password with that stored in the database.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - Retrieve the SIDs of all global groups of which this user is a
      member.
</PRE><P>
   SAM returns the account SID and global group SIDs to MSV1_0.

<P><LI>MSV1_0 on Workstation B returns the account and global group SIDs to the
   Netlogon service on Workstation B, which returns these SIDs, via RPC
   return, to Netlogon service on Workstation C, which returns them to
   MSV1_0 on Workstation C. Note that no token is created on Workstation B
   at this time.

<P><LI>MSV1_0 on Workstation C returns the account and global group SIDs to the
   LSA on Workstation C.

<P><LI>LSA on Workstation C uses the local (Workstation C) LSA policy database
   and data contained in a secured Registry key to retrieve local group
   SIDs and User Rights:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - LSA searches the local LSA policy database for all local groups that
      contain the account SID and/or one or more of the global group SIDs
      (these are the account and global group SIDs obtained from the user
      account database on the "Oz" domain controller).
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - LSA has now collected the account SID, all global group SIDs, and all
      local group SIDs that apply to the specified user name. With all of
      these SIDs, LSA now searches the local LSA policy database for all
      User Rights that have one ore more of these SIDs associated (remember
      that when you use User Manager to assign rights to accounts or
      groups, you first select the User Right, and then associate user
      accounts or groups with this User Right).
</PRE>
<P><LI>LSA (on Workstation C) places all that it has collected thus far--the
<P><PRE>    user account SID, all associated Global and local group SIDs, and a
    mask of applicable User Rights (along with a few other things), into
    the structure that we call the "token" or "access token." LSA returns
    the token to Winlogon.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Winlogon creates a new process in which it runs Program Manager (unless
<P><PRE>    another shell has been specified in the Registry) and attaches the
    token to that process. Any process that is created by Program Manager
    (that is, any program that the user runs from Program Manager) inherits
    the same token.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Whenever the user opens a resource (such as a file, directory, or a
<P><PRE>    network resource connection), the file system that manages that
    resource will be given the token attached to the process that initiated
    the request to open the resource. A local file system, such as NTFS,
    can compare the SIDs in the token to the SIDs in the access control
    list (ACL) of the specified file to determine if the user has the right
    to open the file in the manner indicated (such as opening for Read
    privileges, or for Write privileges, or for Read/Write privileges).
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    NOTE: When an open resource connection request (such as "net use" or
    "File Manager Connect") comes down to the network redirector file
    system, it does not use the token to check ACLs. The redirector (with
    help from components such as the Security Reference Monitor and LSA)
    resolves the token back to the user credentials that were originally
    passed to Winlogon when the local user logged on (when this token was
    generated).
</PRE>
<P><LI>The redirector uses a Server Message Block (SMB) request
<P><PRE>    (SessionSetup...) to pass these credentials (name, password, and domain
    name "Oz") to the user-specified server; in this example, Workstation
    A.
</PRE>
<P><LI>The server service on Workstation A does just what Winlogon did on
<P><PRE>    Workstation C when the user originally logged on. It calls the LSA (of
    Workstation A), passes the credentials, and requests a token.
</PRE>
<P><LI>The LSA (of Workstation A) builds the token as already described.
<P><PRE>    Because Workstation A is a domain controller on the specified domain
    ("Oz"), the account SID, global group SIDs, local group SIDs, and User
    Rights all come from the local user account database and the LSA policy
    database of the server. Note that the user account and LSA policy
    databases are the "domain" user account and LSA policy databases that
    are dynamically replicated--by the Netlogon service, among all domain
    controllers.
</PRE>
<P><LI>LSA returns the token to the server service.

<P><LI>The server service saves the token in its internal "user session" list,
<P><PRE>    and passes an index into that list--a "User ID" or "UID" in the
    [SessionSetup] SMB response back to the Workstation C redirector.
</PRE>
<P><LI>The Workstation C redirector saves the UID in its internal list, with
<P><PRE>    reference to the drive letter (or UNC share name) that was just
    redirected.
</PRE>
<P><LI>When the user on Workstation C opens a file on the redirected drive,
<P><PRE>    the file system that gets the request is, again, the redirector. The
    redirector forwards the Open request(through an "Open" SMB request) and
    the drive letter-associated UID to the Workstation A server.
</PRE>
<P><LI>The Workstation A server service uses the Open SMB-indicated UID to
<P><PRE>    find the associated "user session" list entry so that it can retrieve
    the appropriate token. When the server opens the file locally (on
    Workstation A), this token passes to the local file system that manages
    the file being opened (such as NTFS) and the file system can compare
    the token SIDs to the SIDs contained in the ACL of the specified file
    to determine if the (remote workstation) user has the right to open the
    file in the manner specified.
</PRE><P>
</OL><h3>Workstation C User Does a NET USE to Workstation B</h3>
 
<P>
If the workstation user does a NET USE command to Workstation B, steps 13
through 18 above happen again, and Workstation B creates a new token.
<P>
<P><h3>Workstation C Does Another NET USE to Another Resource on Workstation B</h3>
 
<P>
If the Workstation C user does another NET USE command to another resource
on the Workstation B server, when the resource connection request and the
token reach the local (Workstation C) redirector, the redirector notes that
there is already a secured user session (with a UID) established to the
specified server on behalf of the token-indicated user, and therefore uses
the already-obtained UID in subsequent SMBs used to create the resource
connection and open/access files on that (redirected drive letter)
resource.
