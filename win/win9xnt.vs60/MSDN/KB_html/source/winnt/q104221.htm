<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes and defines Windows NT security as it relates
to the following aspects of the Windows NT Backup program:

<UL><LI>Tape Security and Access
<LI>Tape Ownership and Control
<LI>"Back Up Files and Directories" Right
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Tape Security and Access</h3>
 
<P>
Tape security is in the form of access restriction to an entire tape
or family set. The application does not provide restrictions to
individual sets or files. When creating a new tape, the user has the
option to restrict access to the tape by selecting the Restrict Access
check box in the Backup Information dialog box.
<P>
<P><h3>Tape Ownership and Control</h3>
 
<P>
Under NTFS, file permission information is written with the files to
tape. These are kept for restore purposes only and do not restrict
access to files on the tape. However, the computer name of the system
the backup was made from and user name of the person who first created
a tape or tape set is stored in the tape header. Therefore, if you are
logged on to MACHINE1\USER1, you cannot read secure tapes created by
MACHINE2\USER1. These are considered two separate individuals. This
allows enforcement of minimal restrictions to tape access. Access is
controlled at a "tape" level. No attempt is made to restrict access at
the backup set or to individual files on the tape. The "Restrict
Access to Owner or Administrator" check box designates the tape as a
"secure" tape. If the restrict access is enabled, Windows NT Backup
protects the tape by creating a password from the user name and
computer name. The tape can then be accessed with the backup software
by only the following:

<UL><LI>The system administrator, who has access to all tapes.

<LI>The person who created the tape originally. In this case, you must be
   logged on to the computer where the tape was originally created.

<LI>A person with the "Back up files and directories" right.
<P>
</UL>Any of these people are allowed to read, write, or erase the tape.
Persons without the "Back up files and directories" right cannot
modify the tape unless they created it by writing the first backup
set. This prevents the accidental or deliberate erasure of information
by anyone other than the tape's owner (the person who first wrote the
tape), a backup user, or a system administrator. For tapes being
written to transfer files between computers, "restrict access" should
not be selected. For nonrestricted tapes, anyone would be allowed to
read, write, or erase the tapes. Note that user-supplied passwords are
not used for security purposes because they are easily forgotten. The
proliferation of password use with various utilities can compromise
security when the logon password is used in multiple places. Without
the use of data encryption, tapes are not considered truly secure, and
should be physically secured to protect sensitive data. The backup
utility cannot prevent deliberate erasure of information from a tape.
Security identification (SID) information is not used by Windows NT
Backup.
<P>
<P><h3>"Back Up Files and Directories" Right</h3>
 
<P>
Under NTFS, an Access Control List (ACL) is used to control each
person's rights to system resources. Windows NT Backup will usually
not back up drives, volumes, directories and/or files to which you do
not have access privileges. Your ACL restrictions are inherited by the
application at runtime. The exception is when you have the "Back up
files and directories" right. Under this exception, you are able to
back up and restore drives, directories, and files to which you would
otherwise not have access to. The "Back up files and directories"
right allows you to bypass ACL protection in order to back up
another's files. In addition to being able to read the files, the
"Back up files and directories" right allows Windows NT Backup to
update the "archive" bit in the file header. Windows NT Backup checks
for the existence of the "Back up files and directories" right for the
active user, enables the associated rights while processing files, and
disable these rights when backup/restore operations are complete.
