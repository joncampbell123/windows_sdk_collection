<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Windows NT supports dual-booting between one or more instances of
Windows NT and optionally one additional operating system. The only
additional operating systems that are currently supported are MS-DOS
and OS/2 1.x.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft only supports dual-booting between Windows NT and MS-DOS or
Windows NT and OS/2 version 1.x. The mechanism used by NTLDR.EXE, the
program that controls the Windows NT boot process, permits as many
instances of Windows NT as desired to be included in the boot menu
plus one other operating system. When the other operating system is
selected, NTLDR.EXE loads the BOOTSECT.DOS file that was created
during installation and transfers processor control to that image.
This results in the other operating system booting as if NTLDR had not
intervened. In the case of MS-DOS, the boot sector code looks for
IO.SYS; in the case of OS/2 1.x, the boot sector looks for OS2LDR.EXE.
In both cases, the BOOTSECT.DOS file is created when Windows NT is
installed by copying the existing boot sector that was present before
installation.
<P>
This scheme breaks down when OS/2 2.x or other operating systems are
installed because these operating systems use a different mechanism
for controlling their own multi-boot functionality or use a file
system that is not supported by Windows NT. Briefly, in the case of
OS/2 2.x, a small boot manager partition is installed, which is made
the active partition. The boot code in this partition can then
transfer control to the boot code in one of the inactive partitions on
the disk, effectively booting the operating system installed to that
partition. Because the boot code for OS/2 2.x is not located in the
same partition as the boot code for Windows NT, the mechanism used by
Windows NT is not able to correctly select OS/2 2.x as a boot option.
In the case of other operating systems, the operating system in
question often utilizes its own file system and must be installed from
a different partition than Windows NT for that reason, thus also
rendering the boot mechanism used by Windows NT ineffective.
