IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it
if a problem occurs. For information on how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" online Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry
Key" online Help topic in Regedt32.exe.
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
By default, Windows NT will verify network addresses for existing
connections over IPX by sending out a routing information protocol (RIP)
request for the remote network number every five minutes. While this design
is similar to the behavior of past versions of Novell client software,
these RIP requests are not necessary for proper operations of the
Workstation service, Client Services for NetWare or Gateway Services for
NetWare.
<P>
In most cases, the percentage of network bandwidth consumed by these RIP
requests is almost negligible. However, some network administrators may
prefer to remove any unnecessary network traffic from their network. These
RIP requests can be reduced by setting the values for RipUsageTime and
RipAgeTime to their maximum value of 65535 in the Windows NT registry.
<P>
Windows NT stores the IPX network number to media access control address
mappings in a RIP cache. The RipUsageTime entry informs IPX how many
minutes to wait before an entry in the RIP cache will be deleted from the
cache. The RipAgeTime entry informs IPX how long to wait before requesting
a RIP update for an entry.
<P>
If the connection between Windows NT and a computer on a remote IPX network
cannot be established when using a cached address, Windows NT will request
a RIP update for the remote IPX network number before failing the
connection request.
<P>

<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor
can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and
Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" online Help
topics in Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before
you edit it.
<P>
To set the values for RipUsageTime and RipAgeTime to their maximum values,
perform the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Run Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

<P><LI>From the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following key:
<P>
<P><PRE>      \SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\NWLinkIPX\Parameters
</PRE>
<P><LI>Modify the value for RipUsageTime, setting it to decimal 65535.

<P><LI>Create the following DWORD Value, or modify the value as noted below if
   it already exists:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Value Name: RipAgeTime
      Data Type:  REG_DWORD
<PRE></PRE>      Decimal:    65535

</PRE><P><LI>Close Registry Editor and restart.
</OL>
