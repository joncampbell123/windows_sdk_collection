<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 and 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 and 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
After creating volume sets, stripe sets with parity, stripe sets without
parity, or mirror sets, always save the disk configuration information to
the Windows NT Emergency Repair Disk. Running the Emergency Repair Disk
without updated disk configuration information may make some partitions
inaccessible, or make it impossible to start Windows NT.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
During Windows NT installation, an Emergency Repair Disk is created that
includes the System Registry hive. This contains a Disk subkey that stores
information about disk partitions as they existed during setup. As new disk
partitions are created and existing partitions deleted, the Disk subkey is
updated. Therefore, the Disk subkey on the Emergency Repair Disk should
also be updated.
<P>
Information stored in the Disk subkey includes the number of partitions on
each disk, the signature number of the disk, and additional information on
each partition in the disk such as:

<UL><LI>the type of fault tolerant volume the partition is a member of
<LI>the current fault tolerant state (such as "Healthy")
<LI>the relationship of the partition in the fault tolerant volume
   (for example, in a mirror set the primary partition is identified as
   logical partition number one, and the mirror partition as logical
   partition number two)
<LI>which fault tolerant set the partition is a member of.
<P>
</UL>If the disk configuration is saved in Disk Administrator, it is available
to you if you later have to restore it or to be used with the Emergency
Repair Disk when repairing a damaged Windows NT system.
<P>
If disk configuration information has not been saved to the Emergency
Repair Disk, and you run the Disk and restore the default system hive,
Windows NT and Windows NT Advanced Server will not recognize volumes such
as stripe sets (with or without parity), volume sets, and mirror sets of
partitions other than the boot or system partition. Disk Administrator will
show them as being "single" primary or extended partitions with an unknown
file system type. Although the partitions are intact, Windows NT cannot
identify their volume or partition type.
<P>
When the boot and system partitions are mirrored, running the Emergency
Repair Disk without the updated disk configuration information may result
in this error message at the autocheck screen when you try to start
Windows NT:
<P>
<PRE>   autocheck program not found - skipping autocheck

   STOP:  0xc000021a  {Fatal System Error}
   The Session Manager Initialization system process terminated
   unexpectedly with a status of 0xc000003a. The system has been shut down.
