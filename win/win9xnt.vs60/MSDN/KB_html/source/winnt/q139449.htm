<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article provides specific instructions, through an example, on how to
create and assign each new user a Home Directory in a Windows NT domain.
That is, each user will connect to a share that contains only their files
and directories and nothing else.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In the following example, the user ID is referred to as HomeUser and the
server where the home directories reside is referred to as \\HomeSrv.

<OL><P><LI>Create a directory and share on the server:
<P>
<PRE>   a.    On \\HomeSrv, create a directory called HomeUser. This directory
can
      be in any location on the server hard drive, but user home
      directories are typically created under the C:\Users directory.

   b. Share the HomeUser directory as HOMEUSER. Each user subdirectory
      must be shared separately.

</PRE><P><LI>Create the user ID:
<P>
   a. From User Manager for Domains, choose New User from the User menu.
<P>
   b. Enter a valid user name, description, and password. For the example,
<P><PRE>      the username is HomeUser.
</PRE><P>
   c. Click Profile.
<P>
   d. In the Home Directory box, click the option button next to Connect
<P><PRE>      and choose a drive letter. This drive letter will be used only by
      Windows NT clients. For this example, choose H.
</PRE><P>
   e. In the To box, enter the UNC path where this user's home directory
<P><PRE>      will reside. For example, \\HomeSrv\%username%.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Secure the \\HomeSrv\HomeUser share so only HomeUser has access to
   it.
<P>
   a. Run File Manager, select C:\Users\HomeUser, and choose Share As from
<P><PRE>      the Disk menu.
</PRE><P>
   b. Click Permissions and then click Add.
<P>
   c. Select the HomeUser name and click Add.
<P>
   d. Set the type of access that this user should have to the share.
<P><PRE>      Because this is the user's home directory, they should either have
      Full Control or Change access to the share.
</PRE><P>
   e. Click OK.
<P>
   f. Click Everyone and then click Remove.

<P><LI>Create a logon script if needed.
<P>
   If this user will be logging on from different clients (Windows NT,
   Windows 95, or Windows for Workgroups) then assign a logon script that
   issues a NET USE H: /HOME command. On Windows NT, the command will
   simply fail because the home directory has already been assigned. On the
   other clients it will connect drive H: to the \\HomeSrv\HomeUser share.
<P>
   For more information on creating and assigning logon scripts, see the
   Windows NT documentation and the Knowledge Base.
