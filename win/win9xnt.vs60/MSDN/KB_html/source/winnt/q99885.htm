Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The following security issues may arise due to the way Windows NT handles
Fpnwclnt.dll:

<UL><LI>Windows NT Workstation Setup does not install Fpnwclnt.dll. By default,
   the NTFS permission on the %SystemRoot%\System32 folder allows Everyone
   to create new files. This means that anyone who is logged on locally or
   who has write access to a write-permissible share that includes the
   %SystemRoot%\System32 folder can place a "Trojan horse" version of
   Fpnwclnt.dll in the System32 folder. This version can intercept all
   passwords changed in the local computer's security account manager (SAM)
   database. If the computer is a member of a domain, changes to domain
   user account passwords are not trapped by the password filter.

<LI>Windows NT Server Setup installs Fpnwclnt.dll in the
   %SystemRoot%\System32 folder. If Fpnwclnt.dll is replaced on the Primary
   Domain Controller (PDC) with a "Trojan horse" DLL, the "Trojan horse"
   DLL will receive plain-text access to all password updates for the
   entire domain. However, by default, only a system administrator has
   access to logon interactively to the domain controller, and only system
   administrators have access to default file shares that include the
   System32 folder. The Fpnwclnt.dll file on Backup Domain Controllers
   (BDC) is never used because all domain password changes are processed at
   the PDC.
<P>
   NOTE: The default ACL on the System32 folder is that only Administrators
   can modify files but Everyone can add files.

<LI>Administrators can add their own DLL to the following registry key that
   can obtain the passwords:
<P>
<P><PRE>      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\LSA
      \Notification Packages
</PRE><P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall Windows. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved.
Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the Changing Keys And
Values online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and
Delete Information in the Registry" and Edit Registry Data topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.
<P>
Perform the following steps to resolve this problem:

<OL><P><LI>Apply the latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack to remove the registry key
   on Windows NT Workstation. For information on obtaining the service
   pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
   (without the spaces):
<P>
<P><PRE>      S E R V P A C K
</PRE>
<P><LI>Install Windows NT on an NTFS volume.

<P><LI>Make sure the ACL on the following registry key allows only
   Administrators and the System write access.
<P>
<P><PRE>      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\LSA
</PRE>
<P><LI>Make sure all values in the following registry key are for password
   filter packages that Setup intended to install.
<P>
<P><PRE>      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\LSA
      \Notification Packages
</PRE>
<P><LI>If you do not use FPNW or DSMN, go to the following registry key and
   remove the value FPNWCLNT.
<P>
<P><PRE>      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\LSA
      \Notification Packages
</PRE>
<P><LI>If you use FPNW or DSMN, make sure Fpnwclnt.dll in the
   %SystemRoot%\System32 folder is the version that ships with Windows NT
   4.0 Service Pack 3 (05/01/97, 35,088) and that the NTFS ACL only permits
   access by administrators and the system.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Fpnwclnt.dll is a dynamic link library that lets File and Print Services
for NetWare (FPNW) and Directory Service Manager for NetWare (DSMN) perform
password synchronization with Novell NetWare servers. Fpnwclnt.dll ships
with Windows NT Server and is in the following default registry
configuration:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\LSA
   \Notification Packages

</PRE></OL>Although FPNW or DSMN may not be installed on the PDC, this key exists
because this is the only place to pick up password change notifications and
FPNW must pick up these changes.
