The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The "Path for Manual Update" for loading policies from a named server
location does not support the %LogonServer% environment variable.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This functionality was not designed into the base release of Windows NT
4.0.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In a large multiple master domain model, you would ideally use the
Automatic policy update mode. However, in a large environment, the Policy
file may become large, and associated performance problems may ensue.
Decentralizing the policies would overcome the performance issue, but would
be unmanageable in a large environment.
<P>
Switching to Manual policy update mode allows you to create policies
specific to each resource domain. This works around the potential
performance problems but introduces a single point of failure, because the
Path for Manual Update must be a hard-coded UNC name to a single specific
server location.
<P>
Adding support for %LogonServer% in the Path for Manual Update is a better
solution, as it removes the single point of failure (assuming the network
has more than one logon server), and allows policy processing to be
distributed among the logon servers.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Either accept the single point of failure that choosing Manual policy
update mode for policies entails in the base release, or upgrade to the
latest service pack, which enables %LogonServer% to be used within the
specified Path for Manual Update.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This feature is included in the latest Microsoft Windows NT version 4.00
U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on
