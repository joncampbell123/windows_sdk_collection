<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you start Windows NT version 3.5 using a Madge Smart 16/4 AT Plus
Ringnode Token Ring adapter, it may fail and the following error message
appears:
<P>
<PRE>   At least one service or driver failed during system startup.
   Use Event Viewer to examine the event log for details.

</PRE>The following events are written to the system log of Event Viewer:
<P>
<PRE>   Event ID: 5002, Source: MdgMPort, Type: Error
   Description: Adapter MdgMPort1: The adapter failed to initialize.

   Event ID: 7000, Source: Service Control Manager, Type: Error
   Description: The MdgMPort service failed to start due to the
   following error: A device attached to the system is not
   functioning.

   Event ID: 2012, Source: Srv, Type: Error
   Description: The server has encountered a network error.

   Event ID: 2504, Source: Server, Type: Error
   Description: The server could not bind to the transport
   \Device\Nbf_MdgMPort1.

   Event ID: 9006, Source: Nbf, Type: Error
   Description: Nbf could not find adapter \Device\MdgMPort1.

   Event ID: 9005, Source: Nbf, Type: Error
   Description: Nbf failed to bind to adapter \Device\MdgMPort1.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when the Madge Smart 16/4 AT Plus Ringnode Token Ring
adapter is configured for Normal software operating mode. This token ring
adapter has two software operating modes: Normal mode and AT mode. By
default, the adapter is set to Normal mode, and if the adapter is used in
Normal mode, you can only use the drivers shipped with the Madge Token Ring
adapter. If the adapter is used in AT mode, you can use previous versions
of the drivers, and the Madge configuration software cannot override the
I/O base address, Ring Speed, and SmartROM switch settings.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To correct this problem, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Boot the system to MS-DOS.

<P><LI>Run ATPMODE.EXE (software utility that is shipped with the Madge Token
   Ring adapter to change the software operating mode) at the MS-DOS
   command line, as follows:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ATPMODE /IO=0A20 /WRITE /MODE=AT
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: The command above is used if the I/O base address on the adapter
   is set to 0A20. Please refer to the Madge Token Ring adapter
   documentation for more information about this utility.
