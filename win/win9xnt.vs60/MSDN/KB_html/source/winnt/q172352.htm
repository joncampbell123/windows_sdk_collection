The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After you download a Windows 95 PostScript driver from a server running
Windows NT through point and print, printing options for the printer may
not match what the printer should have.
<P>
Another symptom is that 600 dpi resolution printers are only printing at
300 dpi resolution.
<P>
Windows 95 printer driver details may show that the wrong PPD is in use.
The wrong driver in use is Apple380.ppd.
<P>
If the printer driver is loaded without the use of point and print (the
printer driver is loaded by means of a compact disc, disks, or a share
point), the proper PPD file is used.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When Windows 95 downloads a PostScript printer driver from the server
running Windows NT, it parses the .spd file for the printer capabilities
and creates a .ppd from the .spd. Under certain conditions, the parse
determines that a default .ppd must be used instead. That default .ppd is
the Apple380.ppd.
<P>
Differences between the Windows NT Ntprint.inf and the Windows 95
Printer.inf files can also cause this symptom to occur.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, use one of the following methods below:
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1</h3>
 
<P>
Load the printer driver without the use of point and print. If the driver
needs to be distributed to many workstations, place all of the necessary
files in a shared network directory.
<P>
For more information about how to remove the Windows 95 driver from the
Windows NT print server, please see the following Microsoft Knowledge Base
article:

   TITLE     : How to Remove Cross-Platform Printer Drivers on Windows NT

</PRE><h3>Method 2</h3>
 
<P>
Use the following steps to install the PostScript driver on the server
running Windows NT:

<OL><P><LI>In Explorer, navigate to the %SystemRoot%\INF folder, and then copy the
   Ntprint.inf file to another location or name.
<P>
   NOTE: The INF directory is hidden by default.

<P><LI>Edit the Ntprint.inf file in Notepad and remove everything between the
   printer name and the last quote. For example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      original line: "QMS-PS 2200 v51.0 or 52.3" = Q2200523.PPD
<PRE></PRE>      change to:     "QMS-PS 2200 "              = Q2200523.PPD

</PRE><P><LI>Install the printer on the server running Windows NT 4.0 and share it
   with Windows 95 alternate drivers.

<P><LI>Connect to the printer from the Windows 95 client.
<P>
</OL>After the printer is installed, right-click the printer properties and
verify that the correct driver is associated with the printer.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. We
are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
During the installation of the networked printer, the Windows 95
workstation is provided information on the files that should be copied for
the printer being connected to, and then the file copy takes place. Next,
the Windows 95 workstation finds the driver name installed by the host
computer, in this case the server running Windows NT 4.0, and tries to
match the driver to install. Because the Windows NT host driver name is in
the form of &lt;printer&gt; &lt;ps version&gt; and Windows 95 sometimes only uses
&lt;printer&gt;, there may not be an exact match and it will default to the
generic postscript driver (Apple380.spd).
