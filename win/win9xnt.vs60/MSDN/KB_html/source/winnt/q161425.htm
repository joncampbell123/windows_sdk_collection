The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When one of the network interfaces on a multi-homed computer is out of
service, it is impossible to establish a NetBIOS-over-TCP/IP connection to
the multi-homed computer.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
NetBIOS over TCP (NetBT) only binds to one IP address per physical network
interface. From the NetBT viewpoint, a computer is multi-homed only when
it has more than one network interface card (NIC) installed. When a name
registration packet is sent from a multi-homed computer, it is flagged as
a multi-homed name registration so that it will not conflict with the same
name being registered by another interface in the same computer.
<P>
If a broadcast name query is received by a multi-homed computer, all
NetBT/interface bindings receiving the query will respond with their
addresses, and by default the client will choose the first response and
connect to the address supplied by it. This behavior can be controlled by
the RandomAdapter registry parameter.
<P>
When a directed name query is sent to a Windows Internet Name Service
(WINS) server, the WINS server responds with a list of all IP addresses
that were registered with WINS by the multi-homed computer.
<P>
Choosing the best IP address to connect to on a multi-homed computer is a
client function. The following algorithm is employed, in the order listed:

<UL><LI>If one of the IP addresses in the name query response list is on the
   same logical subnet as the calling binding of NetBT on the local
   computer, then that address is selected. If more than one of the
   addresses meets this criteria, one is picked at random from those that
   match.

<LI>If one of the IP addresses in the list is on the same logical subnet as
   any binding of NetBT on the local computer, then that address is
   selected. If more than one of the addresses meets this criteria, one of
   these is picked at random.

<LI>If none of the IP addresses in the list is on the same subnet as any
   binding of NetBT on the local computer, then an address is selected at
   random from the list.
<P>
</UL>This algorithm provides a reasonably good way of balancing connections to
a server across multiple NICs, while still favoring direct connections
when they are available.
<P>
However, with computers running versions of Windows NT 4.0 prior to
Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 2 (SP2), if the IP address chosen from the
list does not respond, the connection attempt will fail. In some cases
(specifically, the ones listed above where an address was selected at
random), a second or third attempt to connect the resource may succeed;
however, the user or application may receive an error and the retries may
need to be instigated manually.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Windows NT 4.0 SP2 includes an enhancement to NetBT. NetBT still uses the
algorithm listed above to choose a "best" IP address to connect to on a
multi-homed computer; however, now it retains the list of addresses and
orders them by preference. It then attempts to "ping" each of the
addresses in the list in order, until one of them responds. Two ping
attempts are made for each address, with a two-second wait for a response
after each attempt. If there is a successful response to one of the pings,
then a TCP connection and NetBIOS session are established to that address.
If none of the addresses respond to the ping attempts, then NetBT will
revert to the "old" behavior, and attempt to establish a TCP connection to
the "best" address in the list.
<P>
In addition, if a session is already in existence and the network
interface responsible for the session on the multi-homed computer fails,
the failure will be detected and a new session will be established over
one of the working interfaces, provided that one exists.  The status of
open files may not be preserved, as file handles will be invalidated when
the old session is deleted.
<P>
NOTE: This feature is specific to NetBT sessions, and does not apply to
<PRE>      TCP connections used by other higher-level protocols or interfaces,
      such as Windows Sockets.

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 2 includes an enhancement to NetBT that
improves the ability to connect to multi-homed computers even when one or
more of the network interfaces are disabled.  There are currently no plans
to "port" this enhancement back to prior versions of Windows NT.
