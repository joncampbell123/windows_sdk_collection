<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Windows NT and Windows NT Advanced Server both use print processors as
part of the overall printing procedure. The main function of a print
processor is to interpret what type of data is being passed from the
spooler to the graphics engine. Windows NT includes WINPRINT.DLL as
its only one print processor, which can interpret journal and raw data
types.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Journal files are collections of Device Driver Interface (DDI) calls,
which are precise commands specific to a particular hardware device.
For example, a journal file created for a 150 dot-per-inch (dpi)
LaserJet printer would not print properly on a 300 dpi LaserJet
printer. Journal files can also contain TrueType font outline
information, thus the destination printer need not have a particular
font installed to render the print job. Journal files are processed,
passed back to the spooler for routing to the graphics engine
(GDI32.DLL), and then passed to the printer driver and finally sent to
the output device.
<P>
Raw files need no processing from the print processor; they are handed
to the spooler for routing to the graphics engine. An example of a raw
data type is an encapsulated PostScript (.EPS) file because it needs
no print processor interpretation or conversion.
<P>
Windows NT Advanced Server adds another print processor to the system:
SFMPSPRT.DLL. This print processor interprets PostScript information
passed from a Macintosh client and translates it to specific DDI
commands that the Windows NT printer drivers can interpret.
SFMPSPRT.DLL supports the PSCRIPT1 data type, which allows Macintosh
clients to print PostScript files to raster printers.
<P>
Though its main job is to interpret compatible data types, the print
processor also provides access to the printing process. You can modify
the printing process by substituting a custom program in place of the
Windows NT default print processor. A print processor could be used to
filter data, to create a special dialog with the printer device, or to
interpret a new data type. For example, you might have a print
processor that filters ASCII for use on a PostScript printer.
