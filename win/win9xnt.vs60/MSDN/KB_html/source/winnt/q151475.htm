The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0
</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Windows Internet Naming Service (WINS) Administrator Statistics screen
shows the total number of failed queries to be much higher than the total
number of successful queries.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
A computer running the WINS service will listen to all query requests made
to UDP Port 137 and pass that information to WINS to process. If WINS
finds this name in its database it will respond with a Success. This
success is logged as a Successful Query.
<P>
If the name is not found, the response will be  Requested Name Doesn't
Exist. This response will log as a Failure.
<P>
There are services that can exist in a Microsoft Networking environment
that will not register in WINS. These services are queried by Microsoft
clients and responded to through broadcasts, yet direct queries to WINS
for these services will result in unsuccessful responses.
<P>
Two examples are shown below:
<P>
JSPNRMPTGSBSSDIR - Is queried by Windows NT server or Windows NT
<PRE>                   workstation running the RAS Dial-in Service.

</PRE>DOMAIN&lt;1Dh&gt; -  The backup browsers query this name in order to retrieve
<PRE>               the list of available servers from the Master Browser.

</PRE>A trace using Network Monitor will show whether or not the queries to
these names are causing the increase in failure reports.
<P>
For additional information on the name "JSPNRMPTGSBSSDIR," please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
