<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If a computer running Windows NT has multiple network adapters, each
connected to the same physical subnet through additional hardware (such as
a switch), sockets applications use only one of the adapters to communicate
over the network. In addition, if the intermediate hardware fails, sockets
applications do not detect the failure and do not attempt to recover by
using another adapter/switch combination.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
You can use network hardware in parallel configurations to provide fault
tolerance. For example, you can put two network adapters in the same
computer, connected to the same physical subnet, so that if one adapter
fails the other can take over. If you need intermediate hardware, such as a
switch, to connect each adapter to the network, you can attach one switch
to each adapter, rather than connecting all the adapters to the same
switch.
<P>
This strategy assumes that the applications communicating over the network
can detect the failure of one set of network hardware and automatically
start using the other one. Unfortunately, many sockets applications do not
detect hardware failure, and will not automatically use the other set of
hardware. For example, you run the LPR print monitor on a Windows NT print
server with two network adapters, each with its own switch. When LPR
initializes, it makes sockets calls that complete correctly as long as one
of the network adapters is functioning, even if the switch connecting that
adapter to the network has failed. LPR has no way to determine if the
failure is with the switch, rather than with other hardware on the network.
Therefore, LPR has no reason to try the other adapter/switch combination.
While LPR is running it can tell when it loses connections with LPD
servers, but it does not know why. If also doesn't know to try using
another adapter to work around the problem.
<P>
NOTE: This problem applies to hardware connecting the computer to the
network, not to other devices on the network, such as routers. For example,
if there are multiple routes from the Windows NT LPR client to an LPD
server, and one route fails, TCP/IP will automatically use a different
route, and LPR will continue sending its print jobs.
