The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you promote a new PDC on a network that routes only TCP/IP, browse
lists may no longer contain the names of all the computers and domains on
the network.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
In network where only TCP/IP is routed, the primary domain controller (PDC)
acts as the domain master browser. The PDC is also be the master browser
for its subnet. Every other subnet (an independent broadcast region) has a
separate computer acting as the master browser.
<P>
Every 12 minutes, the master browser for each subnet:

<UL><LI>Sends a directed master browser announcement to the Domain Master
   Browser.

<LI>Establishes a TCP/IP connection to the domain master browser, and pulls
   two browse lists from it. One is a list of all machines in the domain
   that are participating in browsing, and the other is a list of all
   domains that have been discovered.
<P>
</UL>Upon receiving the master browser announcement from a subnet master
browser, the PDC should establish a TCP connection to it and pull the
updated browse lists for that subnet. It should then merge those lists into
the complete browse list, which it maintains.
<P>
A timing condition exists in Windows NT 3.5 where the user-mode portion of
the browser code may not have an IRP posted to receive master browser
announcements. When this occurs, the domain master browser begins to drop
master browser announcements. This causes it to stop collecting browse
lists from the subnet master browsers. Computers on those subnets will age
out of the master browse list and no longer be visible in browse lists.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Obtain an updated BROWSER.DLL file from Microsoft . The new BROWSER.DLL
file should be installed on any machine that may be promoted to PDC.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5.
A supported fix is now available, but is not fully regression-tested and
should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem.
Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the service pack release containing this fix.
Contact Microsoft Product Support Services for more information.
