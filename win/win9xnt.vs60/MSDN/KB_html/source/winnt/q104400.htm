<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
Video cards that use the S3 chip set, such as the Diamond Stealth
adapter, may cause hardware (I/O address) conflicts under Windows NT.
Observed behavior may include general video problems and strange
colors. Your computer may stop responding (hang).
<P>
Some S3-based video adapters use an I/O address of 02E8 by default.
This address is also used by default by most serial cards and modems
as COM4. Other hardware, such as network adapters, may also use this
address.
<P>
To resolve any possible hardware conflicts, make sure all adapters in
your computer do not use I/O address 02E8.
<P>
NOTE: Windows NT does not support I/O address or Interrupt (IRQ)
sharing.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
By default, the Diamond Stealth comes configured to use IRQ2. This is
the cascading IRQ to the second Intel 8259 Programmable Interrupt Chip
(PIC). You may experience viedo problems, especially at higher
resolutions, with this configuration.
<P>
To correct this problem, you can disable the Stealth's use of IRQ2 by
removing a jumper from the video card. Please refer to your
Diamond Stealth user's guide for the procedure.
<P>
