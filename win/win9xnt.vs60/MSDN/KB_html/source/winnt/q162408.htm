The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0
- Microsoft Internet Explorer version 3.0
 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The LANGPACK directories of Windows NT Workstation and Server version 4.0
add additional language support for Internet Explorer (IE) version 3.0.
Installing files and adding input locales in Control Panel under either
Regional Settings or Keyboard enables IE to display foreign language
characters. (The GUI for Input Locale is shared by Regional Settings and
Keyboard.)
<P>
The LANGPACK also enables EMS Client version 4.0 to display foreign
language characters included in the pack.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 

<OL><P><LI>Log on to an account with Administrator privileges and start the
   Windows NT 4.0 Explorer. Open the drive sharepoint \NTWKS\NTSVR 4.0
   CD\Network, and then go to the LANGPACK directory.

<P><LI>Select &lt;language | group of languages &gt;.inf file(s) and click the
   file(s) with the RIGHT mouse button.  On the menu that appears, click
   Install.

<P><LI>You will be prompted for your Windows NT compact disc (or network
   driver) if some of the files needed are in this directory (\LANGPACK)
   and the remaining files are in the normal Windows NT distribution
   directories (for example, \i386). Change to the location on the compact
   disc or network sharepoint where the requested file resides, such as
   D:\i386 for a compact disc (where D is a CD-ROM drive) or
   J:\winnt.nt\winnt40.srv\retail\i386 (where \\productsx\relsys is
   accessed as drive J and J is a network drive).

<P><LI>It is necessary to reboot after installing the following languages:
   Japanese, Korean, and TChinese(Traditional Chinese).
<P>
</OL>The following is a list of the .inf files and a brief list of the language
support that each includes:

<UL><LI>Arabic.inf - Arabic code page conversion and NLS API support (no IE 3.0
   viewer support)
<LI>Cyrillic.inf – Cyrillic-based language support
<LI>European.inf – Latin-based European language support
<LI>ExchSrvr.inf - All code page conversion tables for Exchange Server
<LI>Greek.inf - Greek language support
<LI>Hebrew.inf - Hebrew code page conversion and NLS API support (no IE 3.0
   viewer support)
<LI>Japanese.inf - Japanese code page conversion, NLS API support, and font
<LI>Korean.inf - Korean code page conversion, NLS API support and font
<LI>TChinese.inf - Traditional Chinese code page conversion, NLS API
   support, and font
<LI>Thai.inf - Thai code page conversions and NLS API support (no IE 3.0
   viewer support)
<LI>Turkish.inf - Turkish language support
<LI>US_Eng.inf – U.S. English language support
<LI>Vietnam.inf - Vietnamese code page conversions and NLS API support (no
   IE 3.0 viewer support)

</UL><OL><P><LI>In Control Panel, open either Regional Settings or Keyboard, select the
   Input Locales tab, and click the Add button. The Add Input Locale
   window will appear. Select a language and then click OK.

<P><LI>If want to make the highlighted language the Default Input Locale,
   click Set As Default.

<P><LI>Choose a keystroke combination (Left ALT+SHIFT or CTRL+SHIFT) for
   switching locale settings, if desired. This enables you to switch the
   locale by pressing the keystroke combination you selected.

<P><LI>Check the Enable Indicator On Taskbar box so the locale indicator
   will appear on the taskbar.
<P>
</OL><h3>IE 3.0</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>In Control Panel, click Internet then select the General tab. Click
   Fonts Settings and then select the language you want and the character
   sets for that language. Click OK several times to exit. Alternately,
   you can make the change directly in IE 3.0. Open IE 3.0 and on the
   taskbar select View, then click Options. Next, select the General tab
   and click Fonts Settings, then select the language you want and the
   character sets for that language. Click OK several times to exit. (Both
   ways of changing this setting lead you to the same GUI.)
<P>
</OL>For some language characters implemented in Single Byte Character Set
(SBCS), a category that includes most European languages, you can key in
the characters immediately after you complete the above steps.
<P>
But to enter any character of a language of Double Byte Character
Set (DBCS), such as all Far East locales, you must install a proper Input
Method Editor (IME) for the language. The LANGPACK only enables you to
display those DBCS languages included in the LANGPACK in IE 3.0, EMS 4.0,
and Windows NT 4.0.
