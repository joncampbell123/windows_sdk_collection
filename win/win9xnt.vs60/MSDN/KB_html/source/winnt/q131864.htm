<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The following error message appears when you run Microsoft Mail and choose
Postoffice Manager from the Mail menu.
<P>
<PRE>   The postoffice is already being managed by. Try again later.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Mail Postoffice Manager attempts to open FLAG.GLB for exclusive access
before displaying the Postoffice Manager window to determine if the
postoffice is already being managed. Any one of the following conditions
can cause the error noted above:

<UL><LI>Another Mail user has already opened this file for exclusive access by
   running another instance of the Postoffice Administrator, or is in
   the process of creating a new account on the workgroup postoffice as
   part of the Mail initialization procedure.

<LI>You do not have the appropriate file permissions to open the FLAG.GLB
   file. The workgroup postoffice is on an Windows NT file system (NTFS)
   partition and you do not have the appropriate permissions to open
   FLAG.GLB file. All Microsoft Mail users must have Full Control
   permission to the workgroup postoffice directory (WGPO by default) and
   all of its subdirectories and files.

<LI>The read-only file attribute is set on FLAG.GLB.

<LI>FLAG.GLB is locked by the workgroup postoffice server, because there is
   another exclusive open request against this file that has not yet been
   closed.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
