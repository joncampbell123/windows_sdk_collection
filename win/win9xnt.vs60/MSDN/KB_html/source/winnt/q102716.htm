<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article discusses the following aspects of user authentication:

<UL><LI>Storage of the Passwords in the SAM Database
<LI>User Authentication by the MSV1_0 Authentication Package
<LI>Pass-Through Authentication
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Storage of the Passwords in the SAM Database</h3>
 
<P>
User records are stored in the security accounts manager (SAM)
database. Each user has two passwords with which it is associated: the
LAN Manager compatible password and the Windows NT password. Each
password is stored doubly encrypted in the SAM database. The first
encryption is a one-way function (OWF) version of the clear text
generally considered to be non-decryptable. The second encryption is
an encryption of the user's relative ID (RID). The second encryption
is decryptable by anyone who has access to the double-encrypted
password, the user's RID, and the algorithm. The second encryption is
used for obfuscation purposes.
<P>
The LAN Manager compatible password is 100 percent compatible with the
password used by LAN Manager. It is based on the original equipment
manufacturer (OEM) character set, not case sensitive (enforced by
upper casing before encryption), and up to 14 characters long. The OWF
version (called the LAN Manager OWF or ESTD version) of the password
is computed by encrypting a constant with the clear text password
using DES encryption. The LAN Manager OWF password is 16 bytes long.
The first 7 bytes of the clear text password are used to compute the
first 8 bytes of the LAN Manager OWF password. The second 7 bytes of
the clear text password are used to computer the second 8 bytes of the
LAN Manager OWF password.
<P>
The Windows NT password is based on the Unicode character set, is case
sensitive, and can be up to 128 characters long. The OWF version
(called the Windows NT OWF password) is computed using the RSA MD-4
encryption algorithm, which computes a 16-byte "digest" of a variable
length string of clear text password bytes.
<P>
Any particular user account might be missing either the LAN Manager or
Windows NT password, however, every attempt is made to maintain both
versions of the password. For instance, only the LAN Manager version
of the password exists if the user account was ported from a LAN
Manager UAS database using PortUas or if the password was changed from
a LAN Manager or Windows for Workgroups client. Only the Windows NT
version of the password exists if the password is set or changed from
a Windows NT client and the password has no LAN Manager representation
(that is, it is longer than 14 characters or the characters cannot be
represented in the OEM character set). All the existing user interface
limits do not allow Windows NT passwords to exceed 14 characters. The
implications of this are discussed below.
<P>
<P><h3>User Authentication by the MSV1_0 Authentication Package</h3>
 
<P>
All user authentication in Windows NT occurs using the LsaLogonUser
API. LsaLogonUser actually authenticates users by calling an
authentication package. The default authentication package that comes
with Windows NT is the MSV1_0 Authentication Package. The MSV
Authentication Package uses the SAM database as its database of users,
and it supports pass-through authentication of users in other domains
by using the Netlogon service.
<P>
Internally, the MSV authentication package is split into two halves: a
top half and a bottom half. The top half executes on the machine being
logged onto (or connected to). The bottom half executes on the machine
that contains the user account. When both machines are the same
machine, the MSV Authentication Package top half simply calls the
bottom half without involving the Netlogon service. When the MSV
authentication package top half recognizes that pass-through
authentication is needed (based on the fact that the domain name
passed to it is not its own domain name), MSV passes the request to
the Netlogon service, which routes the request to the Netlogon service
on the appropriate machine, which in turn passes the request to the
bottom half of the MSV Authentication Package on that machine.
<P>
LsaLogonUser supports interactive logons, service logons, and network
logons. All forms of logon through the MSV Authentication Package pass
the name of the domain containing the user account, the name of the
user account, and some function of the user's password. These
different types of logon differ in the way the password is represented
as it is passed to LsaLogonUser.
<P>
For interactive logons and service logons, the client logging on is
physically on the machine running the top half of the MSV
Authentication Package. In this case, the clear text password is
passed into LsaLogonUser and the top half of the MSV Authentication
Package. The top half of the MSV Authentication Package converts the
clear text password to both a LAN Manager OWF password and a Windows
NT OWF password before passing it on to either the Netlogon service or
the lower half. The lower half queries the OWF passwords from SAM and
compares the OWF passwords to ensure they are identical.
<P>
For network logons, the client connecting to the machine was
previously given a 16-byte challenge (or "nonce"). If the client is a
LAN Manager client, the client computed a 24-byte challenge response
by encrypting the 16-byte challenge with the 16-byte LAN Manager OWF
password. This is the algorithm used by LAN Manager. The LAN Manager
client passes this "LAN Manager Challenge Response" to the Windows NT
server. If the client is an Windows NT client, the client computed a
LAN Manager Challenge Response, just as above. In addition, the
Windows NT client computes an "Windows NT Challenge Response" by using
the identical algorithm but using the 16-byte Windows NT OWF password
instead of the LAN Manager OWF password. The Windows NT client then
passes both the LAN Manager Challenge Response and the Windows NT
Challenge Response to the Windows NT server. In either case, the
Windows NT server authenticates the user by passing all of the
following to LsaLogonUser: the domain name, the user name, the
original challenge, the LAN Manager Challenge Response, and the
optional Windows NT Challenge Response. The top half of the MSV
Authentication Pack passes this unchanged to the bottom half. The
bottom half queries the OWF passwords from SAM, computes the
appropriate Challenge Response using the OWF password from SAM and the
passed in Challenge, then compares the computed challenge response to
the one passed in.
<P>
As mentioned above, either the Windows NT password or LAN Manager
password might be missing from the SAM database. Also, either the
Windows NT password (or a function thereof) or the LAN Manager
password might be missing from the call to LsaLogonUser. This
paragraph describes which passwords are compared in which cases. If
both the Windows NT version of password from SAM and the Windows NT
version of the password from LsaLogonUser are available, they are both
used. Otherwise, the LAN Manager version of the password is used to
compare against. This rule allows case sensitivity to be enforced when
going Windows NT to Windows NT, but it also allows backward
compatibility.
<P>
<P><h3>Pass-Through Authentication</h3>
 
<P>
The NetLogon service implements pass-through authentication. Its role
is three fold: it selects the domain to pass the authentication
request to, it selects the server within the domain, and it actually
passes the authentication request through to the selected server.
<P>
Selecting the domain is straightforward. The domain name is passed to
LsaLogonUser. The domain name is processed as follows:

<UL><LI>If the domain name matches the name of the SAM database, the
   authentication is processed on that machine. The name of the SAM
   database on a Windows NT workstation that is a member of a domain is
   considered to the name of the Windows NT machine. The name of the SAM
   database on a Windows NT Advanced Server is the name of the domain.
   All logons to Windows NT machines that are not members of a domain
   process requests locally.

<LI>If the domain name specified is trusted by this domain, the
   authentication request is passed through to the trusted domain. On
   Windows NT Advanced Server, the list of trusted domains is readily
   available so this comparison is trivial. On a Windows NT workstation,
   the request is always passed through to the primary domain of the
   workstation, allowing the primary domain to determine if the specified
   domain is trusted.

<LI>If the domain name specified is not trusted by this domain, the
   authentication request is processed on the machine being connected to
   as if the domain name specified were that domain name. NetLogon does
   not differentiate between a nonexistent domain, an untrusted domain,
   and an incorrectly typed domain name.
<P>
</UL>Some network clients don't specify the domain name. These clients
include Windows for Workgroups 3.1 and LAN Manager OS/2 version 2.2. A
patch is available to LAN Manager OS/2 2.2 that causes it to pass a
domain name. A Windows NT workstation handles this NULL domain name by
checking to see if the account exists locally. If so, the request is
processed locally; otherwise, the request is passed to the primary
domain. The Windows NT Advanced Server also checks if the account
exists locally. If so, the request is processed locally; otherwise,
the Advanced Server tries to determine if a trusted domain has the
account. If does this by sending a second-class mailslot message to
each trusted domain. Each trusted domain responds indicating whether
it defines the account specified. The request is passed through to the
first domain that responds affirmatively. If no domain responds
affirmatively, this NULL domain is treated as an untrusted domain (as
described above). If more than one domain responds affirmatively, only
the first response is used. (This is a strong argument for upgrading
clients that pass NULL domain names and having only a single account
for any particular user in the enterprise.)
<P>
NetLogon picks a server in the domain by a process called "discovery."
A Windows NT workstation "discovers" the name of one of the Windows NT
Advanced Servers in its primary domain. A Windows NT Advanced Server
"discovers" the name of an Windows NT Advanced Server in each trusted
domain.
<P>
Pass-through authentication is merely an I_NetLogonSamLogon API call
over the secure channel. If the logon call is an interactive logon,
Netlogon encrypts the OWF passwords with the secure channel session
key before passing them to the NetLogon service. The session key
encrypted OWF passwords are decrypted before they are passed to the
bottom half of the MSV authentication package.
