The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Remote Access version 1.1a
</UL> 
<P>
The recommended Remote Access Client for Windows NT is RAS 1.1a. This
package is available at no charge to owners of Windows NT. See the
following for more information. This article also contains additional
information on older RAS client packages.
<P>
<P><h2>RAS CLIENT INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>RAS 1.1a</h3>
 
<P>
RAS 1.1a is the recommended client software to use with Windows NT
Remote Access Servers. If you own Windows NT or Windows NT Advanced
Server, you can obtain RAS 1.1a for no charge through a fulfillment
coupon located in the back of the Windows NT "System Guide." RAS 1.1a
will also be available through the individual MS Network License
packages. You can install RAS 1.1a on any supported operating system
that has MS Network License. For example, all purchased copies of
Windows for Workgroups 3.1 have the right to use RAS 1.1a at no
charge.
<P>
MS-DOS clients need to own a MS Network License such as MS LAN Manager
or the Microsoft License Pack for Networks.
<P>
In general, RAS 1.1a now supports flow control, error correction and
modem data compression. In addition, it has an expanded supported
modem list to match up with Windows NT RAS.
<P>
RAS 1.1a contains two versions of the MODEMS.INF file. MODEMS.INF
contains standard initialization strings. MCOMP.INF contains
initialization strings with flow control, error correction and modem
compression enabled for most modems.
<P>
For more information, please query on the following words in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>  ras and 1.1a and enhancements and fixes

</PRE><h3>RAS 1.1</h3>
 
<P>
RAS 1.1 was only available as a complete Server and Client package for
use with MS OS/2 LAN Manager server and LAN Manager clients. Major
enhancements of RAS 1.1 over 1.0 include: X.25 support, Windows for
Workgroups 3.1 direct installation support, and so on.
<P>
All clients running RAS 1.1 should upgrade to RAS 1.1a.
<P>
All RAS 1.1 OS/2 LAN Manager servers must stay at this level or
upgrade to Windows NT Advanced Server.
<P>
<P><h3>RAS 1.0</h3>
 
<P>
This is the original Remote Access Product and is no longer for sale
by Microsoft. RAS 1.0 was only available as a complete Server and
Client package for use with MS OS/2 LAN Manager server and LAN Manager
clients. Any RAS 1.0 servers or clients should upgrade.
<P>
<P><h2>RAS OPERATING SYSTEMS</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Windows for Workgroups 3.1</h3>
 
<P>
Windows for Workgroups 3.1 is its own MS Network client. It does not
require MS LAN Manager. RAS 1.1a should be installed directly with
Windows for Workgroups 3.1. RAS 1.1 will recognize Windows for
Workgroups 3.1 clients by default, but version 1.1a is recommended.
RAS 1.0 is not recommended for this client.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Windows 3.1</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft Windows 3.1 requires MS LAN Manager 2.x software. You can
individually purchase MS Network License Packs for your MS-DOS
Clients. RAS 1.1a is recommended client software. The best solution
for this operating system is to upgrade Windows for Workgroups and RAS
1.1a.
<P>
<P><h3>MS-DOS 3.3-6.0</h3>
 
<P>
MS-DOS versions 3.3 through 6.0 require MS LAN Manager 2.x software.
You can individually purchase MS Network License Packs for your MS-DOS
Clients. RAS 1.1a is recommended client software.
<P>
<P><h3>MS OS/2 1.3x</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft OS/2 versions 1.3x require MS LAN Manager 2.x software for
MS OS/2. This is only available as part of MS LAN Manager Server
package.
<P>
In order to use this as a RAS client, you must get RAS 1.1--not RAS
1.1a. RAS 1.1a does not support OS/2. RAS 1.1 is only available as a
separate server package for MS LAN Manager server. It includes both
client and server software for MS OS/2 and MS-DOS.
<P>
<P><h3>OS/2 2.x</h3>
 
<P>
There is no RAS support for OS/2 2.x.
<P>
<P><h3>Windows NT</h3>
 
<P>
Windows NT includes both RAS client and server software. Windows NT
RAS is backward compatible with all previous versions.
<P>
<P><h2>CLIENTS TABLE</h2>
 
<P>
The following table applies only to RAS Client packages and platforms.
The left column contains the operating system and the required MS
Network Client version. The column titles are the various RAS packages
that have been produced by Microsoft.
<P>
The table:
<P>
Yes = Best Recommended combination.
OK  = It will work but it is not recommended.
No  = Will not work or is not supported.
<P>
The values:
<P>
The values in the table are the number of COM ports that are supported
under each combination.
<P>
NOTE: This table does not represent RAS interoperablity.

NOTES:
<P>
A = RAS Software Compression. Windows NT RAS introduced a new RAS
<PRE>    feature called Software Compression. This allows data to be compressed
    before it is transferred. This will work on any modem even those that
    do not support modem hardware compression. Depending on the data type,
    Software Compression can offer 2 to 1 compression ratio or higher.
    This feature offers the best RAS performance available on any
    platform. It is not recommended to use both hardware and software
    compression at the same time.

</PRE>B = Flow Control, Error Correction and Modem Compression. Hardware Flow
<PRE>    Control[RTS\CTS] is available in RAS 1.1a and later. With Flow
    Control enabled, RAS can also take advantage of error correction and
    modem compression. This can significantly improve performance and
    throughput.

</PRE>C = Enhanced Supported Modem List. Windows NT Supports over 100
<PRE>    different modem models. RAS 1.1a supports nearly that many.

</PRE>D = ISDN Support. Integrated Services Digital Network support.
<PRE>    Drivers are included for Digiboard ISDN cards. Supports up to 128K
    bps.

</PRE>E = X.25 public switch network support.
<P>
F = 16550 FIFO UART chip support.
<P>
G = Support for 3rd party external security hosts.
