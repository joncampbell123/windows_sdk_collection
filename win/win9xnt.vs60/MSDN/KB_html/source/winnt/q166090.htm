<P>
<P><h3>Does the MSN Software Work in Windows NT?</h3>
 
<P>
Currently, the MSN software is designed for use only in Windows 95. The
Classic MSN client software (version 1.x) comes preinstalled in Windows
95, and the New MSN software (version 2.0) is available on a CD-ROM that
you can order from MSN. Microsoft is currently developing a version for
Microsoft Windows NT 4.0.
<P>
Although the MSN software does not currently run in Windows NT, you can
still use your MSN account to access the Internet from Windows NT (see the
section titled "How Do I Configure Windows NT to Use an MSN Account for
Internet Access?" in this article).
<P>
NOTE: Although you can access most normal Internet resources, you may not
have access to specific MSN sites that require the Windows 95 MSN browser.
For example, you can connect to <B><A href="http://www.msn.com">http://www.msn.com,</A></B> but you cannot connect
properly to <B><A href="http://onstage.msn.com">http://onstage.msn.com.</A></B>
<P>
<P><h3>Can I Access My MSN E-mail from Windows NT?</h3>
 
<P>
You can access your MSN e-mail from Windows NT when you have migrated your
MSN e-mail account to the MSN POP3/SMTP mail servers. You cannot access
your MSN e-mail from Windows NT if you are using the Classic MSN mail
servers. You can migrate your MSN e-mail account using MSN version 2.5 on
a computer running Windows 95. Once the account has been successfully
migrated then you can access your MSN e-mail from Windows NT using an
Internet mail program. Future versions of MSN may be compatible with
Windows NT.
<P>
For additional information about migrating your MSN e-mail account, see
the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../zmiscellaneous/q176276.htm">Q176276</A></B>
   TITLE     : Frequently Asked Questions About Mail Migration on MSN

</PRE>Does the Internet Connection Wizard Work in Windows NT?
 
<P>
The Internet Connection Wizard (ICW) is part of the Internet Starter Kit
(ISK) and is also included with some versions of Microsoft Internet
Explorer for Windows NT. The ICW included with the ISK does not work in
Windows NT 4.0. For information about running the ICW in Windows NT 3.51,
see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../ie_app/q159686.htm">Q159686</A></B>
   TITLE     : How to Use the Internet Connection Wizard in Internet
               Explorer

</PRE>For additional information, see the Readme.txt file included with your
version of the ISK.
<P>
<P><h3>How Do I Sign Up for an MSN Account Using Windows NT?</h3>
 
<P>
MSN accounts can be obtained or established using the MSN software that
is available in Windows 95, or by calling The Microsoft Network Customer
Service at (800) 386-5550 and requesting that an account for Internet
PPP access be set up manually.
