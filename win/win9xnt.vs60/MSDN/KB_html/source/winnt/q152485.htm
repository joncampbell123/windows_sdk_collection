<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Iomega Jaz and ZIP SCSI devices are recognized by Windows NT as
removable media devices and are treated like any other removable media
under Windows NT. It is important to note, however, that additional
software from Iomega is needed in order to work with write-protected media.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Most removable media provide a hardware based mechanism for write-
protecting of the media. For example, a 3.5-inch floppy disk uses a sliding
tab that can be moved to one position to allow writes, and another position
to protect the media from being written to.
<P>
Iomega employs a software based scheme which requires a utility to write-
protect the media or to remove write-protection. The utilities provided
with the ZIP drives and Jaz drives do not function in Windows NT.
<P>
A set of utilities for Windows NT that will resolve this difficulty is
available on Iomega's web server. Please contact Iomega for details on
obtaining these utilities.
