<P>
Article ID: <B><A href="../winnt/q108413.htm">Q108413</A></B>
<P>
If you set up the DigiBoard 2Port Adapter, after installing U.S. Service
Pack 1, the Port Settings dialog box, used to enumerate and install
additional COM ports, is not displayed. Therefore, some of the
configuration parameters are not correctly written to the Registry. If you
restart your computer, you receive an error message. If you use the Network
portion of Control Panel to remove the driver, you still receive an error
message.

<P><h3>File Manager Error Copying Large Number of Files</h3>
 
<P>
Article ID: <B><A href="../winnt/q108420.htm">Q108420</A></B>
<P>
If you have a directory with a large number of files (for example, 6500)
and then you attempt to delete or move or copy these files, you will
receive an application error in File Manager. This causes Dr. Watson to
make a log.

<P>
Article ID: <B><A href="../winnt/q108504.htm">Q108504</A></B>

When you are using Services for Macintosh (SFM) on a Windows NT Advanced

<P><h3>Windows NT Resource Kit Repair Utility Error</h3>
 
<P>
Article ID: <B><A href="../winnt/q109523.htm">Q109523</A></B>
<P>
When you run REPAIR /C to create a new Emergency Repair Disk, the utility
starts copying files to disks and may successfully create one or more
disks. At some point in the process, it starts prompting for new disks,
reading them for a few seconds without putting any files on the disk and
then asking for another disk. This continues as long as you insert new
disks.

<P><h3>Spool File Location is Not Configurable</h3>
 
<P>
Article ID: <B><A href="../winnt/q109698.htm">Q109698</A></B>
<P>
When you print from an application under Windows NT, the Spooler usually
stores the print job as a pair of files on your hard disk. The location of
these files is not configurable, the Spooler is hard-coded to store the
files at %SYSTEMROOT%\SYSTEM32\SPOOL\PRINTERS.

<P>
Article ID: <B><A href="../winnt/q109785.htm">Q109785</A></B>
<P>
When you run NTBACKUP from a command line, setting the parameter /B (backup
the registry) fails to properly back up the registry. The command excutes
and properly backs up the files in the path specified, but the registry
files WILL NOT be backed up.
<P>
Using the Administrative Tools Backup program correctly backs up the
registry files.

<P>
Article ID: <B><A href="../winnt/q110291.htm">Q110291</A></B>
<P>
Windows NT and Windows NT Advanced Server do not enforce account policy of
minimum password length restriction to new users created from the User
Manager. The behavior is different in Windows NT and Windows NT Advanced
Server as follows:
<P>
If the account policy is made so that the minimum password length must be
at least five characters:

<UL><LI>On a Windows NT Advanced Server machine:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - If a new user is created from the User Manager for domains with just
      the option of "User Must Change Password at Next Logon," any password
      of fewer than five characters is accepted. The user can logon with
      this invalid password and the subsequent password follows the account
      policy and prompts if the password length is less than five
      characters.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - If the new user is created with the remaining options of Password
      Never Expires or Password Cannot Be Changed, the account policy is
      enforced by prompting for a password of at least five characters.
</PRE>
<LI>On a Windows NT machine, a user can be created from User Manager with
   any of the following options and it accepts a password with fewer
   characters than the minimum password length, thereby not following the
   account policy:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - "User Must Change Password at Next Logon"
    - Password Never Expires
    - Password Cannot Be Changed
</PRE><P>

The CD-ROM drive icon may disappear from the File Manager window and Event
Viewer shows the following error:
<P>
<PRE>   The following boot-start or system-start driver(s) failed to load:

      aha154x

</PRE>This error does not allow the CD-ROM drive to be visible in File Manager.

Article ID: <B><A href="../winnt/q110926.htm">Q110926</A></B>
<P>
In the Windows (16-bit) on WIN32 (WOW) application environment, you cannot
replace the installed COM driver (which supports only COM ports COM1
through COM4) with one that supports more COM ports. This is possible in
Windows 3.1, so it seems it should also be possible with WOW, but it is not
possible at this time.

<P>
Article ID: <B><A href="../winnt/q111030.htm">Q111030</A></B>
<P>
If a pre-Service Pack 2 version of NTBACKUP is used to do an operation on a
tape that was backed up using the Service Pack 2 (or later) version of
NTBACKUP, the results are unpredictable. This usually takes the form of
invalid directory or file structures.
