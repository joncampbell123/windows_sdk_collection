<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you have client workstations that use the Novell 16bit Netx network
client software to connect to a Windows NT 3.51 or 4.0 server with File and
Print Services for NetWare, you may encounter the following error on the
client when attempting to log on to the server:
<P>
<PRE>   SERVER/USERNAME: Attempt to log on during an unauthorized time period.
   The Supervisor has limited the time that you can log on to this server.
   You are attached to server SERVERNAME.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The licensing service is configured for "Per Server," and does not have
enough licenses to handle the additional connections of the Novell clients.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
In Control Panel, double-click the Licensing icon. Increase the amount of
concurrent connections to the proper level that are configured for the "Per
Server" licensing option. The licensing service can be configured for "Per
Seat," as long as the correct amount of client licensees have been
obtained.
<P>
