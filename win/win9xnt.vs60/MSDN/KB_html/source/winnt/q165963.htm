<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you install Windows NT on a HP Vectra computer, Setup pauses or
appears to stop responding for a very long time at the point it is trying
to copy the Kbdus.dll from the CD-ROM.
<P>
<PRE>   -or-

</PRE>The computer will stop responding during restart while entering GUI-mode
setup while displaying dots (for example, ...) on the blue kernel screen
loading the Fastfat.sys file.
<P>
Select [VGA MODE] when starting into GUI-mode setup to display the device
driver that causes the computer to stop responding.
<P>
After Windows NT finishes installation and you power off the computer to
perform a cold restart, Windows NT again seems to stop responding for
several minutes while displaying the dots (for example, . . . .) on the
boot screen.
<P>
Once you get into Windows NT, everything works normally and a warm restart
(that is, Shutdown – Restart) starts normally without the long pause.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem has been isolated to a machine BIOS setting for the secondary
IDE controller when only an IDE CD-ROM is attached.
<P>
To verify that this is the cause, perform the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then
   double-click the Devices icon.

<P><LI>Change the startup type of CD-ROM from system to disabled.

<P><LI>Shutdown Windows NT and perform a cold restart of the computer. If the
   pause does not occur or the system responds as expected, then
   communications to the CD-ROM is the source of the system not responding.

<P><LI>Re-enable the CD-ROM device in the Control Panel Devices tool to start
   at startup.
<P>
</OL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
The system BIOS has configured the secondary controller to show a CD-ROM
attached. This setting needs to be disabled. To disable the setting,
perform the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Go in to the system BIOS and disable the secondary controller by
   following this BIOS option tree:
<P>
   configuration
<P><PRE>      hard drives
<PRE></PRE>         hard drive #2 --&gt; enter
            auto or none - select none.  (f7 or f8 to select)

</PRE><P><LI>Exit and save the BIOS options.

<P><LI>Power off the computer and cold start it. The computer should start
   normally and not pause while starting Windows NT. After you log on, you
   should have access to the CD-ROM drive.
