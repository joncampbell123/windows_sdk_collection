The information in this article applies to:

</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article covers the steps required to install and configure Microsoft
DOS on a Windows NT 4.0 Remoteboot server. This article assumes you are
using MS-DOS version 6.22 in all examples.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Installing DOS</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Verify that the Winnt\Rpl\Rplfiles directory is being shared on the
   remoteboot server with a share name of Rplfiles. If your system does not
   have this share, then you either have not installed remoteboot properly
   or have stopped sharing this directory. To resolve this problem, stop
   and restart the Remoteboot Server service. After the service has
   restarted, the Rplfiles share should be recreated. If the share fails to
   create, your remoteboot service is not operating properly, and you must
   remove and reinstall the Remoteboot service.

<P><LI>From an MS-DOS client (running the version of MS-DOS you want to support
   on the Remoteboot server), log on to the network as Administrator and
   connect to the Remoteboot server's Rplfiles share by typing:
<P>
<P><PRE>      net use M: \\NTSERVER\RPLFILES
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      where NTSERVER is the name of the Remoteboot server.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Copy all the MS-DOS files to the M:\Binfiles\Dosxxx directory by typing
   the following commands. You will need to replace the xxx with the
   appropriate DOS version (eg. DOS622 for DOS version 6.22).
<P>
<P><PRE>      COPY C:\DOS\*.* M:\BINFILES\DOS622
      ATTRIB -S -H C:\IO.SYS
      COPY C:\IO.SYS M:\BINFILES\DOS622
      ATTRIB +S +H C:\IO.SYS
      ATTRIB -S - H C:\MSDOS.SYS
      COPY C:\MSDOS.SYS M:\BINFILES\DOS622
      ATTRIB +S +H C:\MSDOS.SYS
</PRE><P>
   The files Msdos.sys and Io.sys must have the hidden and system
   attributes removed prior to copying them to the server. Once the copy
   has been completed, remember to reset the hidden and system attributes
   on the client computer (not on the Remoteboot server) for the DOS system
   to boot properly.
<P>
   NOTE: The hidden and system attributes should not be set on the
   Remoteboot server. If these attributes are set, then the DOS Remoteboot
   client will not boot properly and will display an error:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Non-System Disk error or disk error
</PRE>
<P><LI>If you copied DOS files other than MS-DOS, you must rename the
   input/output system file to Io.sys and the Disk Operating System to
   Msdos.sys. The following example is based on IBM's PC-DOS.
<P>
<P><PRE>      Rename Ibmdos.com Msdos.sys
      Rename Ibmbio.com Io.sys
</PRE><P>
</OL>Please note that the remoteboot service is designed to support Microsoft
DOS.
<P>
<P><h3>Activating the DOS Version</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>From the Windows NT remoteboot server, start the Remoteboot Manager.

<P><LI>Select Configure from the menu bar, and then click Check Configurations.
   This will check the remoteboot system for all available operating
   systems and make them available for the clients.
<P>
</OL><h3>Creating a Remoteboot DOS Client Profile</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>From the Windows NT Remoteboot server, start Remoteboot Manager.

<P><LI>Select Remoteboot from the menu bar, and then click New Profile.

<P><LI>When the New Profile dialog box appears:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Type a Profile Name: MSDOS622
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      Select the Configuration: DOS 6.22 3Com Etherlink II
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      For the Description: Type any descriptive comments
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: Any comments typed prior to selecting a configuration
   or changing a configuration will be over-written with default comments.

<P><LI>Click OK to save the new profile.
<P>
</OL><h3>Assigning a Profile to a Remoteboot Client</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Connect the Remoteboot client to the network, and power the system on.
   The client should start searching for the Remoteboot server. The retries
   counter should increase at a steady pace.
<P>
   NOTE: If your remoteboot client has a hard disk drive and the network
   interface card's Remoteboot PROM does not take control of the boot
   process, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
   Base:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../winnt/q158453.htm">Q158453</A></B>
<PRE></PRE>      TITLE     : How to Enable Remoteboot on a Client's Hard Disk

</PRE><P><LI>From the Windows NT Remoteboot server, start Remoteboot manager.

<P><LI>Select the workstation name corresponding to the client's media access
   control address. The client will have registered its address
   automatically with the server.
<P>
</OL>The media access controll address is a unique 12-digit hexadecimal number
supplied by network adapter firmware. This ID identifies the adapter type
and manufacturer using the first six digits. If this number is not
displayed in Remoteboot Manager, press the F5 key. If you still do not see
this number, it is possible that you have not installed Remoteboot Manager
properly, that the DLC protocol is not installed, or that your client and
server are separated by a router that is not forwarding DLC packets.

<OL><P><LI>Select Remoteboot from the menu bar, and then click Convert Adapters.

<P><LI>When the convert Adapters dialog box appears:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Type a workstation name for the client.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      Type a detail description for the client computer.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      Type a password if desired. A blank or Null password allows
      the Remoteboot client to connect to the RPL server without any
      operator intervention after the power is turned on.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      Select the Configuration type:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>         Shared: the client can share its profile with other clients
         Personal: the must have it own unique profile

      Select the desired Workstation Profile

      Select TCP/IP DHCP / TCP/IP SETTINGS. If you select TCP/IP settings,
      consult your network administrator for proper configuration.

      NOTE: If you are not using TCP/IP, then select the TCP/IP DHCP
      option.

</PRE><P><LI>Click ADD. The Remoteboot system will then create a user account for the
   computer, and the Remoteboot client will continue the startup process
   using the assigned profile.
<P>
</OL>This completes the installation of MS-DOS on a Remoteboot client.
