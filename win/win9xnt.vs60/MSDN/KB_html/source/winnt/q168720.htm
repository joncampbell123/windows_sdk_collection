The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you try to connect with a Windows NT Remote Access Client to a Windows
NT Remote Access Service (RAS) Server, you may see the following error:
<P>
<PRE>   Error connecting to &lt;computer name&gt;

   Checking network protocol connections...

   TCP/IP CP reported error 733: the PPP control protocol for this
   network protocol is not available on the server.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
One of the following may be true about either your RAS configuration or
the TCP/IP protocol on your RAS server:

<UL><LI>Your RAS client dialed in requesting the TCP/IP protocol, but you did
   not select the TCP/IP option in the Server Settings option in Network
   Configuration for Remote Access Setup.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>In Server Settings for Remote Access Setup mentioned above, if you did
   select the TCP/IP protocol, and in the TCP/IP Configure option, you
   also selected the "Use DHCP to assign remote TCP/IP client
   addresses." But the DHCP server is either not installed, the DHCP
   service is disabled in the Services option of Control Panel, or the
   RAS server for some reason could not obtain a lease from the DHCP
   server.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>You have chosen to "allow clients running" the TCP/IP protocol in the
   RAS Server Settings, but some or all of the bindings for the TCP/IP
   protocol have been disabled in the Bindings tab of the Network dialog
   of the Control Panel on the RAS server. Or, alternatively the TCP/IP
   bindings may have become corrupted.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To overcome the error 733, you may have to apply one or more of the
following work arounds:

<UL><LI>Ensure that the TCP/IP protocol is installed on your RAS server and
   that the TCP/IP protocol is selected in the Server Settings of the
   Network Configuration option of the Remote Access Setup dialog.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>If you have the "Use DHCP to assign remote TCP/IP client addresses"
   option selected for the TCP/IP protocol in the RAS Server Settings,
   then ensure that you have installed DHCP and that it is not disabled.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Ensure that all of the bindings for TCP/IP are enabled in the Bindings
   tab of the Network dialog of the Control Panel. Be sure to inspect
   the TCP/IP Protocol and WINS Client(TCP/IP) bindings for all adapters,
   all protocols, and all services. If the TCP/IP bindings are corrupt,
   you may have to reinstall TCP/IP and or RAS in order to clean up the
   bindings.
<P>
</UL>NOTE: If the TCP/IP bindings are only partially disabled, you may still be
able to connect with TCP/IP over PPP without an error, but you may only
have limited functionality over the connection. This will depend on which
TCP/IP bindings are disabled.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If you are using Windows NT 3.5 or 3.51 for your RAS server, and you select
the "Use DHCP to assign remote TCP/IP client addresses" in the RAS Server
TCP/IP Configuration, then you may see this error on the screen after
failing to connect over PPP:
<P>
<PRE>   Error connecting to &lt;computer name&gt;

   TCP/IP CP reported error 736: The remote computer
   terminated the control protocol.

</PRE>Along with this error, you will see the following error in the Event Log of
the Windows NT 3.5 or 3.51 RAS server:
<P>
<PRE>   Event ID 20091                     Source: Remote Access

   The Remote Access Server was unable to acquire an IP address from the
   DHCP Server to be used on the Server Adapter. Incoming user will be
   unable to connect using IP.
