The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When downlevel servers (LAN Manager 2.x machines) are created as
members of a Windows NT Domain, their machine accounts are members of
the Servers Global group and the Domain Users Global group.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When NET ACCOUNTS /ROLE:BACKUP is invoked, LAN Manager server adds
this account and makes it a member of Servers group. It should also
remove it from Users group. The account causes no problems. No one can
use it because its password is machine generated. If its inclusion in
Domain Users is undesirable, an administrator can simply change its
primary group to Servers and then remove it from Users. Netlogon will
still work.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
This is by design. There is no real problem with the account being a
member of Users.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 
<P>
NOTE: Two machines are required for this procedure.

<OL><P><LI>On machine A, run Windows NT Advanced Server as a primary domain
   controller or server.

<P><LI>On machine B, run OS/2 and LAN Manager 2.2 as a backup domain
   controller (BDC) in the same domain as machine A.

<P><LI>On machine A, start the User Manager for domains. Notice that
   machine B is listed in the Main User list.

<P><LI>Double-click the Machine account so that the properties dialog box
   of that account is displayed.

<P><LI>Click Groups. Notice that the Machine account is a member of the
   Servers Global group and the Domain Users Global group.
