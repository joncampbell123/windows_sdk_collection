<P><h3>The Microsoft Encryption Pack 1</h3>
 
<P>
What is the Microsoft Encryption Pack?
<P>
This compact disc contains two components, a high-encryption version
of Service Pack 1 for Windows NT(R) version 4.0, and a high-encryption
version of Internet Explorer 3.01. Service Pack 1 is available for
Alpha, MIPS, PPC and x86 platforms. Internet Explorer 3.01 is currently
only available for Intel(TM) Hardware Platforms.
<P>
Why Might I want It?
<P>
The United States government restricts the strength of encryption that we
may export. In order to provide the most powerful security solutions
available for Windows NT 4.0 , Microsoft has included stronger encryption
technology in Encryption Pack 1 for customers in the United States and
Canada.
<P>
Export Restricted
<P>
Export of the 128-bit strong encryption technology included on the
Encryption Pack CD is regulated by the International Traffic in Arms
Regulations (ITAR, 22 CFR 120-130) of the U.S. State Department, Office
of Defense Trade Controls). A State Department license is required to
take this technology outside of the United States or Canada.
<P>
The specific high-encryption components included with the CD are:
<P>
For Windows NT Workstation 4.0:
<P>
128-bit encryption support for Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) 2 in Peer Web
Service
