<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
With a data link control (DLC) connection established to a mainframe over
an IBM 2210 router on a slow network, the network communication fails
between the mainframe and the Microsoft DLC client.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When the IBM 2210 router is operating on a slow network there is a
possibility that the receive buffer for the router (the receiving station)
will fill up. Under these conditions, the IBM 2210 router will send two LLC
packets to the Microsoft client (the sending station), a Receiver Not Ready
(RNR) which indicates that the last Information Frame (I-Frame) packet was
received from the sending station and that the receiving station is
temporarily unavailable. Then the sending station sends a Receiver Ready
(RR) for the same sequence packet that it had previously acknowledged with
a RNR frame. This causes a problem in the Microsoft DLC stack because our
client is not expecting two acknowledgements for the same I-Frame packet.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If you look at a network trace of this problem, you will see a RNR message
from the router immediately followed by a RR message. The Microsoft client
will send a frame reject (FRMR) message followed by a disconnect (DISC)
message.

<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51.
A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-
tested and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific
problem. Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem,
Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains
this fix. Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
