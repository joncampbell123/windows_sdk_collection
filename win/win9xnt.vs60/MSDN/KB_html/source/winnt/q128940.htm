The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
You are unable to install the updated driver for the DEC DC21040 PCI
Ethernet adapter (DC21X4.SYS) included with Windows NT 3.5 U.S. Service
Pack 2.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The file name of the DEC DC21040 driver included with Windows NT 3.5
is DC21040.SYS. Because the file name is different than the file name
of the DEC DC21040 driver included with Service Pack 2, the driver is
not updated when you install Service Pack 2.
<P>
Service Pack 2 does not include an .INF file that can be used to install
the DC21X4.SYS driver. The INF file included with Windows NT 3.5 cannot
be used to correctly install the DC21X4.SYS driver.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
The DC21040.SYS driver included with Windows NT 3.5 is version 6.0. DEC has
released version 6.3 of this driver. Please contact DEC to obtain this
driver.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. We
are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
