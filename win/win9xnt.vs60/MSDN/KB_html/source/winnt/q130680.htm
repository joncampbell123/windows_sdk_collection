<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When starting the Network Control Panel tool (Ncpa.cpl), the lists of
Services, Protocols, and Adapters installed can all appear blank.
<P>
The ODBC tool is also affected in a similar way for the same reason.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
A new registry key has been added under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE, and
the user currently logged on does not have read rights to this key.
<P>
When the Network Control Panel tool starts up, it scans
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE for "Manufacturer" keys (for example,
Microsoft). It then looks at registry keys under each Manufacturer key for
"Product" keys (for example, Tcpip). Once it has found a product key it
looks for a version key (for example, CurrentVersion) and then a key called
NetRules. If it finds a key called NetRules it assumes that this subkey is
defining a network component that it needs to be able to configure.
<P>
However, NCPA assumes that it has read rights to all Manufacturer and
Product keys. If it gets an access denied error at any time while scanning
these keys it terminates the scanning process and just uses the information
it has already procured. This means that if a third party adds a key under
SOFTWARE that is alphabetically before 'Microsoft,' and it has restricted
rights applied to it, then NCPA is never able to retrieve the list of
Network components from the registry and presents a blank list.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Ensure that if it is necessary to restrict access to any data in a key
under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE, the key is placed at least three levels
down the tree from this point.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. We
are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
