The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0
</UL>

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
A file or directory on an NTFS volume cannot be deleted or accessed.
Windows NT returns an "Access Denied" error message when you attempt to
manipulate the file. You are not able to view the permissions, the owner,
or the contents of the file. The file does, however, show up in a DIR
listing in File Manager and in Explorer. This occurs even though the user
trying to access the file has permissions to the file. Even an
administrator will be unable to take ownership of this file.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
There are two causes:

<UL><LI>This file is in a state known as pending deletion. This file has been
   deleted, but there are still handles open to it. NTFS will wait until
   all handles to this file are closed before updating the index. If an
   attempt is made to access the file, however, NTFS will deny the attempt.
   Because the file is listed in the index, but is effectively deleted, you
   can see the file but you cannot access it.

<LI>The file has become corrupted.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
The following are the resolutions to the above causes respectively:

<UL><LI>This is by design. Simply wait for all of the handles to this file to be
   closed, and the file will be removed from the index. If it is a
   directory that is in this state, make sure that this directory does not
   have a share associated with it or any directory below it in the tree.
   Restarting the machine will always make the file disappear, since all
   handles will be closed upon shutdown.

<LI>Run CHKDSK /F on the volume that contains the file.
</UL>
