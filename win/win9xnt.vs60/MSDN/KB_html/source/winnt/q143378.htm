The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51 and 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you have nine connections of Rclient.exe running on the same computer
then attempt to add a tenth (or more), the tenth connection will appear to
stop responding. The first nine connections keep on working normally.
Killing or exiting from one of the nine working connections will free up
resources that allow the tenth connection to start working normally.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Rclient.exe is the client of the Remote Console utility, which allows the
user to remotely take control of a CMD console session and is included in
the Windows NT 4.0 Resource Kit. Remote Console is composed of a service,
the server, and a client. (For more information on Remote Console, please
refer to the resource kit help files.)
<P>
The Remote Console client, Rclient.exe, makes intensive use of completion
I/O ports. By default, it uses three worker threads: one to send the data
to the server and two to read the data from the server. As Remote Console
works entirely asynchronously, the two read operations are in a pending
state most of the time, and all the redirector resources are consumed.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Modify the number of redirector worker threads at the client side by
editing the registry.
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them.
Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of
Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.
<P>
Modify the following value under the registry key
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CCS\Services\LanmanWorkstation\Parameters (CCS is
for CurrentControlSet):
<P>
ValueName = MaxThreads REG_DWORD
<PRE>Default   = 17
</PRE>Modify to = 49
<P>
This will enable up to 49 simultaneous instances of Rclient on a single
computer.  Notice that going above the limit also requires modification of
the server parameters on the server.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows NT
versions 3.51 and 4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
