<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
One of the more frequent trap codes generated by Windows NT is STOP
0x0000000A. This STOP message can be caused by both hardware and software
problems. To determine the specific cause, you must debug the STOP.
However, some general information can be learned by examining the
parameters of the STOP message and the STOP screen information.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
STOP 0x0000000A indicates a kernel mode process or driver attempted to
access a memory address that it did not have permission to access. The most
common cause of this error is a bad or corrupt pointer that references an
incorrect location in memory. A pointer is a variable used by a program to
refer to a block of memory. If the variable has a bad value in it, then the
program tries to access memory that it should not. When this occurs in a
user mode application, it generates an access violation. When it occurs in
kernel mode, it generates a STOP 0x0000000A message.
<P>
To determine what process or driver tried to access memory it should not,
look at the parameters displayed on the STOP screen information. For
example, in the following STOP message
<P>
<PRE>   STOP 0x0000000A(0xWWWWWWWW, 0xXXXXXXXX, 0xYYYYYYYY, 0xZZZZZZZZ)
   IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL
   ** Address 0xZZZZZZZZ has base at &lt;address&gt;- &lt;driver&gt;

</PRE>The four parameters inside the parenthesis have the following meaning:
<P>
<PRE>   0xWWWWWWWW   Address that was referenced improperly
   0xXXXXXXXX   IRQL that was required to access the memory
   0xYYYYYYYY   Type of access, 0=Read, 1=Write
   0xZZZZZZZZ   Address of instruction which attempted to reference
          the memory at 0xWWWWWWWW

</PRE>If the last parameter (0xZZZZZZZZ) falls within the address range of
one of the device drivers loaded on the system, you will know which
device driver was running when the memory access occurred. This driver is
often identified in the third line of the STOP screen:
<P>
<PRE>   **Address 0xZZZZZZZZ has base at &lt;address&gt;- &lt;driver name&gt;

</PRE>If &lt;driver name&gt; is a specific driver, search in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base on the keyword 0x0000000A and the driver name. If you don't
find any relevant articles, contact Microsoft Product Support.
