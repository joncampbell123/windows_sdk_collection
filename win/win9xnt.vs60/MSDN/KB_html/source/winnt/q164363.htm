<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article provides information on troubleshooting possible configuration
problems Internet Protocol (IP) Routing Information Protocol (RIP) when you
use Routing and Remote Access Service (RRAS).
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following list contains possible configuration problems with IP RIP.
All the options mentioned in these steps are configured on a per-interface
basis. You can accomplish this with the Routing and Remote Access
administrator tool found in the Administrator Tool (Common) group. Routing
and Remote Access administrator can also be started by running
Mpradmin.exe. This is not the same as IP RIP service included with
Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0.

<UL><LI>If you have a mixed environment of RIP version 1 and RIP version 2,
   Check the General tab to verify that RIP version 2 is using broadcast
   instead of multicast.

<LI>If you have selected the Enable Authentication box on the General tab,
   make sure that the password in the Password box is the same as the
   password on the router receiving packets from this interface. By
   default, authentication is off. Passwords are case sensitive.

<LI>Ensure that you are only accepting routes from the routers you want.
   Check the Security tab to see which routers are allowed to exchange
   information. By default, all routes are accepted.

<LI>If host routes or default routes are not being propagated as you expect,
   change settings on the Advanced tab. By default, host and default routes
   are not sent or accepted.

<LI>If RIP does not learn routes over a demand-dial link, use multicast
   instead of broadcast. This is because demand-dial links can have
   endpoints on different subnets where broadcast RIP requests cannot be
   heard.

<LI>When you use Auto-Static RIP on a demand-dial interface, you must
   manually update routes the first time you make a connection. To do this,
   click Summary in the IP Routing folder, select the demand-dial
   interface, right-click, point to Update Routes and then click. This must
   also be done on the other router for the corresponding interface. The
   routes then appear under Static Routes.
