<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Hewlett-Packard (HP) NetServer series computers with onboard Adaptec
AIC7770 SCSI controllers stop responding (hang) during SCSI detection in
Windows NT Setup. Even if Setup completes successfully, Windows NT may hang
during the boot process.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem is caused by several factors, such as outdated drivers,
outdated firmware and computer configuration. Another contributor to the
problem is a conflict with the data transfer rate of the onboard AIC7770
SCSI controller.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
In order to correct this problem, the following procedures for Windows NT
version 3.1 and Windows NT version 3.5 are recommended. If you experience
additional problems, refer to your hardware documentation or contact HP
Technical Support at (208) 323-2551.
<P>
<P><h3>Windows NT 3.1</h3>
 
<P>
A fix is available on HP's BBS at (408) 344-1691. The file to download is
LMLFB01D.EXE. This driver replaces ARROW.SYS (which becomes NTBOOTDD.SYS
after installation.) After following the instructions of the README file,
you may do the following to implement the fix:

<OL><P><LI>Make a copy of your master Windows NT Setup Disk for CD-ROM Installation
   disk using the MS-DOS DISKCOPY command. Label the copy as the work
   disk.

<P><LI>Delete the SCSI driver from the work disk. For example, if the work
   disk is in the A drive, type the following command:
<P>
<P><PRE>      del a:\arrow.sys
</PRE>
<P><LI>Start the installation of Windows NT as normal using the work disk in
   place of the Windows NT Setup Disk for CD-ROM Installation disk.

<P><LI>When prompted for the type of setup, choose custom setup.

<P><LI>Press S to configure additional SCSI adapters after Setup scans your
   system for SCSI host adapters and displays the list of recognized
   adapters.

<P><LI>Select the Other (requires disk provided by a hardware manufacturer)
   option. Setup will prompt you for the location of the disk. Specify the
   following location:
<P>
<P><PRE>      a:\winnt
</PRE>
<P><LI>Insert the HP NetServer LM/LF NetWare, OS/2, MS-DOS and Windows NT SCSI
   Driver disk into drive A and press ENTER. A dialog box will appear that
   displays:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Adaptec 2740/AIC 777x
</PRE>
<P><LI>Press ENTER to select this driver and continue with the Windows NT
   installation.
<P>
</OL><h3>Windows NT 3.5</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Verify that the ARROW.SYS file in the %systemroot%\SYSTEM32\DRIVERS
   subdirectory is the one shipped with Windows NT version 3.5. The file
   size of ARROW.SYS is 38,224 bytes dated 9/4/94.

<P><LI>Verify the version number of the Flash BIOS on each NetServer computer,
   which are listed below:
<P>
<PRE>   Models      486-processor          Pentium-procoessor
   -------------------------------------------------------
   LM          1.00.19.AMO or later   1.00.19.AMO or later
   LF and LC   4.02.23.PA or later    4.02.18.PB or later
   LE          Z.04.01 or later       Z.04.01 or later

</PRE><P><LI>If PCI slots on the NetServer machines are not used, disable them.

<P><LI>Verify that the Secondary Cache Mode on the computer is set to
   Write-through. The default is Write-back.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: For steps 3 and 4 above, run the EISA Configuration utility shipped
with the Hewlett-Packard NetServer series computers.
