<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use File Manager in Windows NT, and are working with files with
long names that contain spaces, those names may in some cases be
displayed in a truncated format.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The parser routine being used truncates file names after the last space
(" ") found in long file names. File Manager displays this truncated
file name. The truncated file name is used to find approximate matches
of all similar file names for a length up to the space where the break
occurs. The resulting match list contains all matching file names,
including file names listed in 8.3 format.
<P>
<P><h2>STEPS TO REPRODUCE</h2>
 

<OL><P><LI>Open File Manager and select a long file name containing spaces.
</OL>2. Choose File and then Properties
3. Select the Open By button to display the Network Properties window
4. The text associated with File Name may display a truncated length;
<PRE>   for example, the name "test 123 456 789.txt" is displayed as "test 123
   456".

</PRE></OL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
This problem has been resolved in a hotfix to the file NTlanui.dll. Use
of this fix resolves the display problem so that the complete file name
will be displayed. Note, however, that this fix may have the following
side effect: After you install it, Windows NT may underreport the number
of files that are open. This occurs because the request for a more
detailed match (using the long file name) may result in no matches
against a file list in cases where the file is represented in 8.3
format.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51.
A supported fix is now available, but is not fully regression-tested and
should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem.
Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the service pack release containing this fix.
Contact Microsoft Product Support Services for more information.
