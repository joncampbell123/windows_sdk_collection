The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0
</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When a session is established on the Microsoft Windows NT Server Service, the user account database or SAM (security account manager) database that is used to validate the credentials is chosen based on certain rules. The server looks at the domain name field in the server message block (SMB) file and at the print sharing protocol to determine which database will be authoritative.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Windows NT uses the following rules to determine which user account database to use when validating a user's credentials: 
<P>
<PRE>   If the domain name provided is a trusted domain, pass-through
   authentication is used to pass the credentials to the trusted
   domain for validation. If the user account does not exist in
   the trusted domain and the guest account is enabled on the
   local machine, the guest account is used.

   If the domain name provided is that of the domain controller
   itself, the domain controller will use its local SAM
   database. If the server or workstation being accessed is a
   member of that domain, the request is processed remotely
   using pass-through authentication through the implicit trust
   to one of its domain controllers. If the username provided
   does not exist in this primary domain and the guest account
   is enabled on the local machine, then the guest account is
   used.

   If no domain name is provided, such as when a down-level
   legacy client is used, the local SAM database is first
   checked, and then all trusted domains are checked with pass-
   through authentication. This can produce inconsistent results
   if the user name exists in multiple trusted domains. The
   first domain that responds will be used for the validation.
   If both the local SAM and no trusted domains are able to
   validate the credentials, and the guest account is enabled on
   the local computer, the guest account is used.

   If the domain name provided is not a trusted domain, the Local 
   SAM is used for validation. If the user name does not exist 
   locally, the guest account is used. 

</PRE>What follows is some sample output from Network Monitor that shows a session setup and the credentials that are passed to the server. Windows NT uses the domain name to determine which user account database has the authority to validate the user.
<P>
<PRE>   SMB: Command = C session setup &amp; X
   SMB: Word count = 13
   SMB: Word parameters
   SMB: Next offset = 0x00D2
   SMB: Max Buffer Size = 4356 (0x1104)
   SMB: Max MPX requests = 50
   SMB: VC number = 0
   SMB: Session Key = 0
   SMB: Password length = 24 (0x18)
   SMB: Unicode Password length = 24 (0x18)
   SMB: Capabilities = 212 (0xD4)
   SMB: Byte count = 149
   SMB: Byte parameters
   SMB: Account name = acctname
   SMB: Domain name = DOMAINNAME
   SMB: Native OS = Windows NT 1381
   SMB: Native Lanman = Windows NT 4.0

</PRE>In the response from the server, the domain name indicates which domain the server is a member of, regardless of the SAM that was used to validate the user. What follows is an example of the session response from the SMB server.
<P>
<PRE>   SMB: Command = C session setup &amp; X
   SMB: Word count = 3
   SMB: Word parameters
   SMB: Next offset = 0x0084
   SMB: Setup action = 0x0000
   SMB: Byte count = 91
   SMB: Byte parameters
   SMB: Native OS = Windows NT 3.51
   SMB: Native Lanman = NT LAN Manager 3.51
   SMB: Domain name = DOMAINNAME
