The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0
</UL> 
IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt.32.exe.
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Password changes using Apple Talk or Vines Protocol do not work as expected
even though the AppleTalkClientSupport and/or VinesClientSupport registry
values have been entered as a REG_DWORD set to 0x1 on the following key:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
A logic error in the Lsass.exe process prevents either of these two
registry values from functioning properly unless TcpipClientSupport and/or
NetwareClientSupport is added as a registry value as well.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
In addition to AppleTalkClientSupport and/or VinesClientSupport, also add
NetwareClientSupport (if NWLINK is installed) and/or TcpipClientSupport (if
TCPIP is installed) as directed in the MORE INFORMATION section below.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0.
This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows
NT version 4.0. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):
<P>
<PRE>   S E R V P A C K

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor
can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.
<P>
Password changes using Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) over sockets to
communicate directly to Lsass.exe on the primary domain controller (PDC) is
possible by enabling appropriate registry values on the LSA key:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa

</PRE>The registry values are based on the protocol being enabled, (not the type
of client) that socket support is intended for. (In other words, a Novell
Netware client using TCP/IP as its network protocol would require
TcpipClientSupport enabled on the PDC, not NetwareClientSupport.)
<P>
TcpipClientSupport is required for support of TCP/IP (ncacn_ip_tcp)
NetwareClientSupport is required for support of NWLINK protocol (ncacn_spx)
AppleTalkClientSupport is required for support of AppleTalk protocol
(ncacn_at_dsp)
VinesClientSupport is required for support of Vines protocol
(ncacn_vns_spp)
<P>
These registry values must be created on the PDC (and should be created on
all BDCs) as REG_DWORD values set to 0x1. Also, the registry value should
only be created if the protocol it is intended to support has been
installed on the Windows NT server.
