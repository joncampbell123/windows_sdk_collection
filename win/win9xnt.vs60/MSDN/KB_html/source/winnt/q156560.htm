<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The conversion of a disk partition from the FAT file system to NTFS
requires a certain amount of free disk space be available in order to build
the NTFS disk structures. This article provides a description of the
process Convert.exe uses to convert FAT to NTFS and discusses the space
required for conversion.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
FAT and NTFS use very different on-disk structures to represent the
allocation of space for files. These structures are often referred to as
meta-data or file system overhead.
The FAT file system's meta-data consists of a boot sector, one or more File
Allocation Tables, a fixed-size root directory structure, and a variable
amount of space for each sub-directory related to the number of files in
the sub-directory.
<P>
Another kind of overhead associated with both FAT and NTFS is related to
the fact that both file systems allocate disk space in clusters of a fixed
size. The exact size of these allocation units or clusters is determined at
format time, and the defaults are dependent on the size of the volume. The
default cluster size for NTFS is smaller than the default for FAT on
similarly sized volumes.
<P>
Because space for file data can only be allocated in whole cluster amounts,
even a one byte file will end up using a cluster's worth of disk space on a
FAT volume. The NTFS case is similar, but slightly more complicated and
will not be covered in detail in this article.
<P>
Like FAT, NTFS has a certain amount of fixed size overhead and a certain
amount of per-file overhead. In order to support the advanced features of
NTFS, such as recoverability, security, support for very large volumes, and
so forth, the NTFS meta-data overhead is somewhat larger than the FAT meta-
data overhead. On the other hand, because NTFS cluster overhead is smaller
than FAT cluster overhead, it is often possible to store as much, if not
more data on an NTFS volume as on a FAT volume, even without using NTFS
file compression.
<P>
In order to guard against the possibility of corruption caused by failure
during conversion, Convert.exe must build the NTFS meta-data using only
that space which is considered free space by the FAT file system. In this
way, if the conversion fails to complete, the FAT representation of the
user files is still valid. Complicating this strategy is that one sector of
NTFS data must occupy a specific location on the disk, and a very limited
number of other structures must occupy contiguous sectors.
<P>
The general outline of the conversion process is as follows:

<OL><P><LI>Create holes (that is, relocate FAT clusters) for the fixed-location
   NTFS structure and other contiguous data (if necessary) and save the new
   FAT. If the necessary sectors cannot be made available due to being
   unreadable, for example, the conversion process will fail and the FAT
   volume will remain in the same state it was in before the attempted
   conversion.

<P><LI>Create NTFS elementary data structures in FAT free space. These are the
   fixed-size tables and structures common to any NTFS volume. The size of
   these tables may vary depending on the size of the volume, but do not
   depend on the number of files on the volume.

<P><LI>Create the NTFS master file table and directory listings in the FAT free
   space. The space required for this step is variable and depends on the
   total number of files on the FAT volume.

<P><LI>Mark as free in the NTFS bitmap those NTFS clusters being used by FAT-
   specific structures. After the conversion is complete, the FAT meta-data
   overhead can be reclaimed as free space to NTFS.

<P><LI>Write NTFS boot sector. This is the final action that causes the volume
   to be recognized as NTFS rather than FAT. If the conversion fails at any
   step prior to this, the volume will still be a valid FAT volume and will
   be recognized as such.
<P>
</OL>Because a crash can occur at any time, the process described above
minimizes the chance of disk corruption.
<P>
NOTE: Almost all writes are to FAT free space, so a failure will preserve
the FAT intact.
<P>
The only times at which we write to non-free space, for example, the times
at which a failure might cause problems are:

<UL><LI>At the end of step 1, when CONVERT overwrites the FAT. The algorithm for
   relocating clusters guarantees that if a failure does take place during
   this stage, CHKDSK will be able to fix the disk without any loss of
   data.

<LI>In step 5, while writing the boot sector. If a failure occurs during
   this step, and the volume being converted is the system partition (the
   active, primary partition used to boot the system) there is a chance
   that the system could be left in a state where it would not start. In
   the unlikely event that this takes place, it should still be possible to
   start the system using a boot floppy disk.
<P>
</UL>Convert.exe performs a computation based on the number of preexisting files
on the FAT volume and size of the volume to figure out how much free space
is required before starting the conversion process. For standard hardware
(hard drives with 512 bytes per sector) the equation boils down to the
following:

<OL><P><LI>Start by taking the size of the volume, in bytes, and dividing by 100.
   If this value is less than 1,048,576, use 1,048,576. If it is larger
   than 4,194,304, use 4,194,304.

<P><LI>Add to the above the size of the volume in bytes divided by 803.

<P><LI>Add to the above the number of files and directories on the volume
   multiplied by 1280.

<P><LI>Add to the above 196,096.
<P>
</OL>In addition to the above, if there is extended attribute information on the
FAT volume, Convert.exe will take into account the additional space that
will be required. Extended attribute information is normally not present
and would only be a consideration if the system had been running OS/2 and
extended attributes were in use.
<P>
The above computation closely mirrors the computation performed by
Convert.exe. The exact result obtained on a given system may differ
slightly.
<P>
NOTE: This is the free space required by Convert.exe before it will attempt
a conversion. The computation includes an allowance for the possibility
that bad sectors may be encountered in the FAT free space. However, in
cases where a volume has just enough free space to begin the conversion,
and a significant fraction of drive space is discovered to be unusable, the
conversion process may fail. As discussed above, this should not result in
any disk corruption. The volume should automatically fall back to being
recognized as FAT.
