<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This explains why a Domain Name Service (DNS) Alias record is needed, and
how to create it.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Sometimes it is useful to be able to access a server (or any host) by using
a name other than its DNS host name.
<P>
For example, you have an Application Server whose DNS configuration is as
follows:
<P>
<PRE>   Host Name   Domain Name
   ---------   -------------
   myserver    mydomain.com

</PRE>You have also setup your server as a WWW server so Internet or Intranet
browsers can access Web pages from it. You want people to access your Web
server by specifying www.mydomain.com as its name instead of
myserver.mydomain.com.
<P>
To accomplish this, an alias (or canonical name) record needs to be added
to your DNS server.
<P>
The DNS server should already have the following record under the
mydomain.com zone (IPAddress should be the IP address of your server):
<P>
<PRE>   Myserver   A   &lt;IPAddress&gt;

</PRE>The following record should be added to the mydomain.com zone:
<P>
<PRE>   www   CNAME   myserver.mydomain.com

</PRE>When a DNS server looks up a name and finds a CNAME record, it replaces the
name with the canonical name, and looks up the new name, in this case,
www.mydomain.com.
<P>
NOTE: It is possible to have several aliases for a single host. Please note
that it is suggested that each alias refer to the original A record,
though, and not to one of the CNAME records for the host. This will provide
a more direct route to resolving the host name rather than forcing the DNS
Server to resolve multiple CNAME records.
