The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0.

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Network virus scanning software packages can cause network errors when
installed on Windows NT Server.  These packages can also cause problems
when upgrading to Windows NT Server 4.0.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Third-party network virus scanning software can be installed on Windows NT
Server to check files for viruses as they are copied to and from a server.
These programs are installed as a service and they act at the file system
level.
<P>
These services will often run fine until a seemingly unrelated change, like
adding a fault tolerant set or installing a service pack, is made to the
server. Often the users will report that similarly configured servers run
the same scanning software without a problem.
<P>
Common symptoms that suggest a problem with virus scanning software include
clients mysteriously being disconnected or being unable to connect to the
server in question, or users being unable to save or retrieve files. Often
clients trying to access a server will get the message "Not enough server
storage is available to process this command" when trying to attach to a
server.
<P>
If the network connection problems are present and a virus scanning product
is installed, disabling the scanning service will confirm that the problem
is the virus scanning software. Sometimes it may be necessary to disable
the service and restart the server. If the virus scanning service is
determined to be the problem, contact the manufacture of software in
question.
<P>
When upgrading a server to Windows NT 4.0 it is advisable to disable the
virus scanning services, because  Stop 0x00000050 error messages (blue
screens) and other system problems have been observed after upgrading
systems with these services installed. The software vendor or manufacturer
should be contacted before upgrading a server to find out what procedures
or updates are necessary when upgrading to Windows NT 4.0.
