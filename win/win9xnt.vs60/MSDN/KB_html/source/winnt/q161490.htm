The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Power users and print operators may receive the following error when
installing print drivers:
<P>
<PRE>   An error has occurred copying (driver file).

</PRE>An example is the file Pjlmon.dll. Repeated attempts to retry will also
fail.
<P>
This is not a critical error, even though the dialog box has popped up. The
error occurs because the file already exists, and the system has denied
access to copy this file over the currently existing file. To continue,
select Skip File and proceed.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
It is possible to get the above error message on any error that does not
allow a copy command to complete. In the above scenario, the error is
received when an attempt is made to replace a file that is currently in
use. Normally the printer drivers are not in use if they are not installed
already. Even with printer drivers that are being reinstalled, the file is
only used for short periods of time in a read-only mode. The above file is
a print monitor. Print monitors are used to communicate directly between
the print spooler and the printing device. This causes the monitor to
always be in use if the print spooler service is in use.
<P>
By default security, the setup routines built into Windows NT only allow an
administrator to replace files in use. This is done to keep other users
from replacing system files. Microsoft is researching methods to allow
controlled access to updating files. These methods are expected to become
available in future versions of Windows NT.
<P>
Currently several methods are available to resolve the error message shown
above:

<OL><P><LI>When the error is displayed, select Skip File. (The file already exists
   and probably does not need to be copied over.)

<P><LI>Edit the file Ntprint.inf located in your Windows NT system \INF
   directory.
<P>
   A. Open this file using NOTEPAD. (It is advisable to make a backup copy
<P><PRE>      of this file in case of errors.)
</PRE><P>
   B. To locate the entries that point to the file you are receiving errors
<P><PRE>      on, open the Edit menu and click Find.
</PRE><P>
   C. Remove the entries. This can be done for a specific printer (noted
<P><PRE>      above each section in brackets [ ] ) or for all entries.
</PRE><P>
   D. Save the file.

<P><LI>Edit the registry to add permissions to the key where the commands are
   stored until the next reboot.
<P>
</OL>WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them.
Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of
Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.
<P>
<PRE>   A. Run Regedt32.exe.

   B. Go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session
      Manager.

   C. Highlight this key and select Security, then Permissions.

   D. Add the groups that you wish to be able to install drivers without
      error with FULL Control.

</PRE></OL>Because the above error condition is based on the setup APIs built into
Windows NT, it could also affect other programs that attempt to update
files that are in use during an install from any account other than
administrator.
