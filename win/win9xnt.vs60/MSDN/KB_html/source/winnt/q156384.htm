The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0
</UL>

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Attempts to pass IP broadcasts, such as DHCP traffic, over a Token Ring
transparent bridge may fail. This failure results in various symptoms, such
as the inability to obtain an IP address via DHCP, or the inability to
resolve the names of computers on the other side of the bridge.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Computers running Microsoft Windows NT set the source routing bit in all IP
broadcast traffic by default. Transparent bridges may discard frames with
source routing information when passing them to different media types, such
as Ethernet.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them.
Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of
Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.
<P>
In order to configure a computer running Microsoft Windows NT version 4.0
to send IP broadcasts without source routing, the following Registry
parameter must be added and set to 0:
<P>
<PRE>   ArpAlwaysSourceRoute
   Key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services
         Tcpip\Parameters
   Value Type: REG_DWORD - Boolean
   Valid Range: 0,1 (False or True)
   Default: 0 (False)

</PRE>When you set this parameter to 1, you force TCP/IP to transmit ARP queries
with source routing enabled on token ring networks. By default, the stack
transmits ARP queries without source routing first, and retries with source
routing enabled if no reply was received. After applying the hotfix
referenced in this article, adding this parameter and setting it to 0 will
cause all IP broadcasts to be sent without source routing.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. A
supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested
and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem.
Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix.
Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
