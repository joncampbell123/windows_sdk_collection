The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5 and 3.51
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
A file lock may not appear to be free on a Macintosh computer attached to a
MAC Volume when the following occurs:

<OL><P><LI>A personal computer-based application locks a record in the file on a
   Macintosh Volume.

<P><LI>The Macintosh attempts to lock the same record and gets a return code
   indicating that the record is already locked.

<P><LI>The personal computer-based application releases its lock on the record.

<P><LI>The record still appears to be locked when viewed from the Macintosh
   even though it is not locked.
<P>
</OL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The cached information for the lock in Services for Macintosh is not
cleared out when the personal computer lock is removed.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51.
A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression tested
and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem.
Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix.
Contact Microsoft Product Support Services for more information.
