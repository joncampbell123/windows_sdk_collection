SUMMARY
 
This article provides the steps necessary to recover mirroring using IDE
devices under Windows NT. This article should be used in conjunction with
the information in the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base,
which explains how to create a NT Fault Tolerant Boot Disk
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../winnt/q119467.htm">Q119467</A></B>
   TITLE: Creating a Boot Disk for an NTFS or FAT Partition

   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../winnt/q102873.htm">Q102873</A></B>
   TITLE: BOOT.INI and ARC Path Naming Conventions and Usage

</PRE>Soft Mirroring (Windows NT) does NOT mirror MBR/PT entries, as soft
mirroring is only designed to mirror a partition's data, and cannot
guarantee boot capability of the Shadow (mirrored) drive. Thus you should
always have a valid NT Fault Tolerant Boot Floppy created in the event the
Primary drive fails.

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The IDE specification requires that a working master drive be available at
all times to be able to gain access to other IDE drives on the system.
following are the appropriate steps to mirror an IDE hard drive with
another.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Step-by-Step Procedures</h3>
 
<P>
If the shadow (mirrored) hard drive is on the same channel set as an IDE
Slave device then use the "Failed Primary on the Same IDE Channel" section
of this article below.
<P>
If the shadow (mirrored) hard drive is on the Secondary channel across from
the failed Primary drive then see the "Failed Primary is on the Primary IDE
Channel and the Shadow is on the Secondary" section of this article below.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>Failed Primary on the Same IDE Channel (Shadow drive is a Slave IDE Device</h2>
 
<P>
*** If the replacement drive HAS ALREADY been installed: ***

<OL><P><LI>Edit your Windows NT FT boot disk's Boot.ini file to point to:
<P><PRE>     multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(1)...
</OL></PRE>2. If the replacement drive is not identical to the failed IDE hard drive,
<PRE>   you must go into CMOS and use either the AUTO DETECT HARD DRIVE feature
   in your CMOS or manually set the new hard drive Heads/Cylinders/Sectors.
</PRE></OL>3. Boot the Windows NT FT boot disk and load Windows NT.
4. Start Disk Administrator, and break the mirror.
5. Establish another mirror by mirroring from the slave hard drive to the
<PRE>   master drive.

</PRE>*** If the replacement drive HAS NOT been installed: ***

<OL><P><LI>Verify that the jumper on the Shadow IDE hard drive is moved from Slave
   to Master or standalone.
</OL>2. Edit your Windows NT FT boot disk's Boot.ini file to point to:
<PRE>     multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)...
</PRE></OL>3. If the shadow drive is not identical to the failed IDE hard drive,
<PRE>   you must go into CMOS and use either the AUTO DETECT HARD DRIVE feature
   in your CMOS or manually set the new hard drive Heads/Cylinders/Sectors.
</PRE>3. Boot the Windows NT FT boot disk and load Windows NT.
4. Start Disk Administrator, and break the mirror.
5. Establish another mirror by mirroring from this hard drive to the
<PRE>   new Shadow (IDE Slave) drive.


</PRE>Failed Primary is master the on the Primary IDE Channel and the Shadow is
master on the Secondary IDE Channel
 
<P>
*** If the replacement drive has already been installed: ***
<P>
1) Edit your Windows NT FT boot disk's Boot.ini file to point to:
<PRE>     multi(1)disk(0)rdisk(0) if the Shadow drive is the Master Device of
     the Secondary Channel
     multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(2) may also work

     multi(1)disk(0)rdisk(1) if the Shadow drive is the Slave Device of the
     Secondary Channel
     Multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(3) may also work.

</PRE>2) If the replacement drive is not identical to the failed IDE hard drive,
<PRE>   you must go into CMOS and use either the AUTO DETECT HARD DRIVE feature
   in your CMOS or manually set the new hard drive Heads/Cylinders/Sectors.
</PRE>3) Boot the Windows NT FT boot disk and load Windows NT.
4) Start Disk Administrator, and break the mirror.
5) Establish another mirror by mirroring from the this hard drive to the
<PRE>   new Shadow drive.

</PRE>*** If the replacement drive HAS NOT been installed: ***
<P>
1) Move the Shadow drive to the Primary Channel as the Master Device and
<PRE>   ensure it is jumpered in the same manner as the Failed Primary drive.
</PRE>2) Edit your Windows NT FT boot disk's Boot.ini file to point to:
<PRE>     multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0) if the Shadow drive is the Master Device of
     the Primary Channel.
     multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(1) if the Shadow drive is the Slave Device of the
     Primary Channel.
</PRE>3. If the Shadow drive is not identical to the failed Primary IDE hard
<PRE>   drive, you must go into CMOS and use either the AUTO DETECT HARD DRIVE
   feature in your CMOS or manually set the new hard drive
   Heads/Cylinders/Sectors.
</PRE>4. Boot the Windows NT FT boot disk and load Windows NT.
5. Start Disk Administrator, and break the mirror.
6. Establish another mirror by mirroring from this hard drive to the
<PRE>   new shadow drive.
