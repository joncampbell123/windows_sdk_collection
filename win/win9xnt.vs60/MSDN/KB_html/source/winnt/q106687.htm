<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you cross Novell routers (file servers or multi-protocol routers)
using NWLink, you may receive some erratic behavior unless a Registry
entry is made for maximum packet size.
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The symptoms for this problem vary. In some cases, the response to a drive
connection in File Manager takes minutes to respond. In other cases, File
Manager stops responding (hangs). Sometimes, error messages are returned
indicating a network problem. Even if a connection takes place, erroneous
results may be returned. This problem has been reported in both Token Ring
and Ethernet environments.
<P>
For example, share the WINNT\SYSTEM32 directory which contains greater
than 500 on one Windows NT Advanced Server machine. When you attempt
to connect to this share (as Administrator) from a different Windows
NT Advanced Server, you will receive a "No Files Found" error message.
In this example, the only machines on this internetwork are the two
Windows NT Advanced Servers and a NetWare 3.11 file server acting as a
router. The following NLMs are loaded on the NetWare server: ISADISK,
TOKEN, NMAGENT, and MONITOR.
<P>
Making the same connection when both Windows NT Advanced Server
machines are connected to the same Token Ring produce the correct
result. Directories containing only a few files may not exhibit the
above behaviors.
<P>
The reported Ethernet problem occurred in a complex WAN environment.
Lowering the packet size resolved the issue without any other changes being
required. The symptom in this case was the inability to remotely administer
one Windows NT Advanced Server from another one separated by a wide area
link.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
The workaround to this problem is to add an entry to the registries of
the Windows NT machines as follows:
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause
<PRE>         serious, system-wide problems that may require you to
         reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft cannot
         guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of
         Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own
         risk.

</PRE><P><LI>At a command prompt, type REGEDT32.

<P><LI>Single-click on HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE window.

<P><LI>Double-click the following in the order listed: SYSTEM,
   CurrentControlSet, Services.

<P><LI>Scroll to NWLINKIPX.

<P><LI>Double-click the following in the order listed: NWLINKIPX,
   NetConfig, Driver01.

<P><LI>Check to see if there is a MaxPktSize entry in the box on the right.
   If so, double-click it and proceed to step 8.

<P><LI>If MaxPktSize does not exist, select choose Add Value from the Edit
   menu. In the Value Name field, type "MaxPktSize" (without the
   quotation marks. Change the Data Type field to REG_DWORD. Choose OK.

<P><LI>Change the Radix field to Decimal. For Token Ring, enter 1500 in the
   Data field. For Ethernet, enter 1000 in the Data field (higher values
   may be possible). Choose OK.

<P><LI>Quit the Registry Editor, quit all open applications, shut down and
   restart the machine.
