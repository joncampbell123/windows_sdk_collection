The information in this article applies to:

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Under User Properties in User Manager for Domains, it is possible to set
User Must Change Password at Next Logon and User Cannot Change Password
checked at the same time. Thus, the user will be prompted to change his
password but then will get the error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Unable to change the password on this account.
   Please consult your system administrator.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
In User Manager for Domains under Policies/Account if the Maximum Password
Age expires and User Cannot Change Password is checked, you will see these
boxes checked at the same time, User Must change Password at Next Logon and
User Cannot Change Password. Since these options exclude each other it
should not be possible for both of them to be selected.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Have the administrator go into User Manager for Domains; Policies - Account
and set the Maximum Password Age to Password Never Expires, then the user
should be able to change the password. Or have the administrator change the
password.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Workstation and
Server versions 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0. We are researching this problem and
will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
