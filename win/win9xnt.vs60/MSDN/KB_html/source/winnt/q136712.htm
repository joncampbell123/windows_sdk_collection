SUMMARY
 
<P>
The following are common questions and answers regarding browsing with
Windows NT on your local area network (LAN).
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Question:
<P>
Does browsing printers work the same as browsing servers?
<P>
Answer:
<P>
Yes. When a print server announces itself, it sets the
SV_TYPE_PRINTQ_SERVER bit in the announcement. Print manager requests
domains and print servers in its NetServerEnum request.
<P>
Question:
<P>
If a multihomed computer connected to two disjoint networks runs Windows
NT with TCP/IP installed and functions as a browser, can clients on one
network browse servers on the other network?
<P>
Answer:
<P>
No. As far as the browser is concerned, these are two disjoint networks
and the browser is not able to browse across disjoint networks (only across
subnets on a single network). The critical issue is that NetBT presents
the cards as distinct physical networks to the browser.
<P>
For a Domain Master Browser, the list of servers returned to the client
only contains the servers that are associated with the endpoint the browse
request was received on. This is done because the Domain Master Browser
does not know if the servers on the other endpoint are reachable by the
clients. Because backup browsers, or local Master Browsers, rely on the
master list of servers from the Domain Master Browser, a local Master
Browser (even if also multihomed), does not provide a list of remote
severs either.
<P>
On the other hand, the IPX protocol presents a multihomed computer as a
single atomic network, so the Windows NT browser browses across those
networks.
<P>
For additional information about multihomed browsing, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

               and Protocols

</PRE>Question:
<P>
What registry parameter is used to hide a server from the browser?
<P>
Answer:
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them.
Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of
Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

<OL><P><LI>Under the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following subkey:
<P>
<P><PRE>      \SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters
</PRE>
<P><LI>From the Edit menu, choose Add Value and type:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Hidden
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: This value is case sensitive and must begin with a capital H.

<P><LI>In the Data Type field, choose REG_DWORD and choose OK.

<P><LI>In the Data field, type 1 to enable hiding and choose OK.
<P>
   NOTE: Data field range: 0 or 1
<PRE>         Default: 0 (false)

</PRE><P><LI>Restart your computer.
<P>
</OL>Question:
<P>
On a Windows NT Server, if you run Control Panel and choose Network, and
then select Computer Browser and choose Configure, a dialog box with the
option Other Domain appears. What does this option do?
<P>
Answer:
<P>
You can use this option to make a domain that only contains LAN Manger
servers visible to a Windows NT browser.
<P>
NOTE: LAN Manager server browser announcements use the DOMAIN&lt;00&gt; name
format. Windows NT based browsers ignore this name format by default.
<P>
Question:
<P>
What are the registry parameters related to browsing?
<P>
Answer:
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them.
Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of
Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.
<P>
Under the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, look under the following subkeys
for some common registry settings that relate to browsing:

<UL><LI>\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters\LMannounce
<P>
   LMannounce parameter information:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Value is set to 1 (TRUE) to make Windows NT browser visible to LAN
      Manager clients. This setting causes the Windows NT browser to
      announce itself with a LAN Manager 2.x compatible server
      announcement.
</PRE>
<LI>\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Browser\Parameters\IsDomainMaster
<P>
<P><PRE>    - IsDomainMaster parameter information:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>         When set to 1, this parameter provides a priority boost to
         increase its likely hood of winning a master browser election. It
         does not allow the browse server to become the domain master
         browser. This value is a boolean value and can be any of the
         following: Yes/No, True/False, or 1/0.

    - MaintainServerList:

       - When set to NO, the server is not a browse server.
       - When set to YES, the server becomes a browse server.
       - When set to AUTO, the server becomes a browse master if the
         master browser asks it do so.
