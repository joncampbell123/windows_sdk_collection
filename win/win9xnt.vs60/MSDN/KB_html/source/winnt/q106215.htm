The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Windows NT does not contain drivers for the COMPAQ SCSI Compression
Adapter and the older COMPAQ SCSI Option Adapter. COMPAQ provides
these SCSI adapters as optional equipment on some of their models.
Neither one is listed on the Windows NT Hardware Compatibility List
(HCL). However, COMPAQ has written a Windows NT driver that supports
these two SCSI adapters.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The driver that supports the COMPAQ SCSI Compression Adapter and the
COMPAQ SCSI Option Adapter is called SCSICOMP.SYS, and it is available
on the COMPAQ Support Software Diskette (SSD) for Microsoft Windows
NT. The SSD can be downloaded from the COMPAQ BBS. The number for the
COMPAQ BBS is (713) 378-1418.
<P>
The name of the archive file to download is SP0616.ZIP. The file
unzips into SP0616.EXE, which is a self extracting archive file. When
the EXE is executed, it explodes into several other files. One of
these is README3H.1ST which contains instructions on how to create the
SSD.
<P>
The following information was taken from the file SCSICOMP.RDM which
is located on the COMPAQ SSD. This is some additional information on
usage of the COMPAQ SCSI Compression Adapter and the COMPAQ SCSI
Option Adapter with the driver (SCSICOMP.SYS) provided by COMPAQ.

<UL><LI>When you use the internal connector on the COMPAQ SCSI Compression
   Adapter, the external connector must be terminated with the terminator
   which came with the adapter. Unpredictable results may occur
   otherwise.

<LI>This driver will run ONLY with Microsoft Windows NT or Windows NT
   Advanced Server version 3.1. Using the driver with earlier Beta
   versions may give unpredictable results.

<LI>Backup can be performed using this driver only if the backup
   hardware vendor provides class drivers for the tape backup devices
   which can be attached to the COMPAQ SCSI Compression or Option
   Adapter. The three tape devices that the COMPAQ SCSI Compression and
   Option Adapter support are: COMPAQ 320/525 MB tape drive, the COMPAQ
   320/525 MB ACA tape drive and the COMPAQ 1.3/2.0 GB DAT drive.
