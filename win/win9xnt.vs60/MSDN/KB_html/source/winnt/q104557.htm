When running under Windows NT, PostScript-specific printing features
in 16-bit Windows-based applications may not be enabled or may not
function correctly. Examples of these features include printing EPS
(encapsulated PostScript) graphics and performing color separations.
In general, these applications will behave the same with a
nonPostScript printer driver under Windows NT as they do when they run
under Windows 3.1.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Many 16-bit Windows-based applications designed for graphics
production and desktop publishing have printing features that assume
the use of a PostScript printer driver. The application typically
disables these features if it does not sense a PostScript printer
driver. Most applications use the GetTechnology printer escape (API)
to determine the type of printer driver. Under Windows 3.1, this
escape returns "PostScript" when the current printer driver is a
PostScript driver.  Under Windows NT, this escape always returns
"WinSpool", regardless of the current base driver or minidriver. As a
result, the 16-bit Windows-based applications will assume the current
printer driver is not a PostScript driver and will disable its
PostScript-specific features.
<P>
A common end result is that EPS graphics do not print correctly. EPS
graphics are composed of PostScript commands that generate a graphic
image. Therefore, they cannot be printed except on a PostScript
printer. The EPS graphic can optionally include a TIFF (Tag Image File
Format) graphic that roughly represents the image the PostScript
commands should produce. When an application knows it is printing with
a PostScript printer driver, it sends the PostScript commands
contained in the EPS graphic as part of the print job. If the
application does not sense a PostScript printer driver, it typically
sends the TIFF graphic (if there is one) or simply prints a rectangle
to show the size and/or position that the EPS file would have occupied
on the page. If the application sends a TIFF graphic, the output may
appear jagged and blocky compared to the normal EPS output on a
PostScript printer.
<P>
32-bit Windows NT-based applications do not rely on the GetTechnology
escape. Instead, they can call Windows NT-specific APIs to determine
the capabilities of the base printer driver, thus PostScript-specific
features function normally.
