The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0
</UL>

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Although the RSHSVC utility included in the Windows NT Server Resource Kit
uses the .Rhosts file for the Account Level Equivalence (ALE) security,
RSHSVC does not do the ALE security check as is explicitly specified in the
Rshsvc.txt or Rshsvc.htm files, therefore it poses a security leak or hole.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
A Remote Shell Server Service (RSH) Daemon normally provides one or two
levels of security: the Host Level Equivalence (low/loose), by using the
Hosts.equiv file and the Account Level Equivalence (high/tighter), by using
the .Rhosts file (The period "." is part of the name!).
<P>
According to the Rshsvc.txt or Rshsvc.htm file, the Rshsvc.exe file
running on an IP host (local computer) provides the ALE security and is
supposed to check the user name (either the client user name or server user
name) of a user who tries to remotely access from a remote host, and the
remote host name against the entries in the .Rhosts file under the
%SystemRoot%\System32\Drivers\Etc directory on the local computer.
<P>
RSHSVC supposedly returns an access denied error message when any of the
following conditions occur:

<UL><LI>The RSH client computer name is not specified in the .Rhosts file.

<LI>The name of the user that is logged on to the RSH client computer is not
   present in the .Rhosts files.

<LI>RHSVC (using GetHostByName) failed to resolve the IP Address of a
   computer, say Mx, specified in the .Rhosts files and a user is trying
   to access this service from that computer Mx.
<P>
</UL>But RSHSVC fails to check whether the user name is authorized or not in the
.Rhost file and mistakenly let any unauthorized user name access the local
computer as long as it comes from an authorized host computer.
<P>
This poses serious security problems such as delete file, kill process,
and so forth.
* 2. Issue the following command from an authorized remote computer. (But
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in NT version 3.5x/4.0 and we
are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
