The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5 and 3.51
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If the Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) service is installed on a
Remote Access (RAS) server that has a multiport adapter, such as a
Digiboard or a Chiliports, it usually fails to start.
<P>
The event log contains multiple WINS errors. There is no pattern to the
errors in the event log, but they are usually related to the WINS service
failing to start. The WINS service may run correctly until a seventh modem
is added to the server. At this point, the WINS service fail. If six or
fewer modems are used, the WINS service seems to function normally, but may
still fail.
<P>
Errors in the system log may include:
<P>
<PRE>   Event ID: 4146

   WINS error 33 processes cannot access file because another process
   has locked the file

   7023:  THE WINDOWS INTERNET NAME SERVICE TERMINATED WITH THE
   FOLLOWING ERROR:  (No error information is given in the message.)

</PRE>In all cases, the WINS service does not start.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The failure occurs because WINS does not allocate enough storage while
reading the registry value for the Export key under Linkage for NetBT.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem:

<UL><LI>Use six or fewer modems on the RAS/WINS server.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Separate the RAS and WINS services (move the WINS service to a
   separate computer).
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.50
and 3.51.
A supported fix is now available, but is not fully regression-
tested and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific
problem. Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem,
Microsoft recommends that you wait for the service pack release containing
this fix. Contact Microsoft Product Support Services for more information.
