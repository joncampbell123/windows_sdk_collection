<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run Windows NT Setup on your PC-compatible computer with a Conner
CFP1060S SCSI hard disk installed, the installation of Windows NT fails. If
Setup does not fail, you experience data corruption during normal usage.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The version of your Conner CFP1060S is designed for non PC-compatible
computers, and therefore does not work properly in your PC-compatible
computer.
<P>
There are two versions of the Conner CFP1060S SCSI hard disk: PC-compatible
and non PC-compatible. To verify that you have the non PC-compatible hard
drive model, check the hard disk interface connector:

<UL><LI>The non PC-compatible model has an 80-pin connector with an additional
   adapter that converts the 80-pin connector to 50 pins. In addition, this
   drive has the labeling "Conner CFP1060S w/SCA 80pin-50pin adapter."

<LI>The PC-compatible model has a standard 50-pin SCSI connector.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve the problem if you have the non PC-compatible model, replace it
with a PC-compatible drive.
<P>
According to Conner Technical Support the Conner CFP1060S drive has been
discontinued in the 50-pin PC-compatible format.
