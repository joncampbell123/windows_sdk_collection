</UL>

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When attempting to replicate the User Accounts Database (UAS), the
following message appears in the Event Log (use the Event Viewer to view
the Event Log):
<P>
<PRE>   Event ID: 5718
   Description: The UAS Built-in database synchronization failed.

</PRE>The last four bytes of the binary data included with the Event ID is
"C0000124."
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This binary data translates to the Windows NT status code of
"STATUS_SPECIAL_ACCOUNT." This indicates an illegal operation has been
attempted on a reserved (built-in) Security Accounts Manager (SAM) account.
For an example, you attempted to delete the Administrator User, Guest User,
or a local group such as Administrators.
<P>
Under normal circumstances, this is not the problem because a user
typically is not deleted during a full synchronization procedure. You
cannot make the administrator account a non-administrator by removing it
from the administrator's local group. You cannot disable the administrator
account by selecting the "Disable account" check box in User Manager. You
cannot set the administrator account to expire. These are all the reasons
the SAM might return the C0000124 STATUS_SPECIAL_ACCOUNT.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
One method to determine the nature of problem is to inspect the SAM on the
Primary Domain Controller (PDC) to see if any of the above conditions have
occurred and correct them.
<P>
If you cannot correct the issue via User Manager you may need to reinstall
the Backup Domain Controller (BDC) if that is where the issue is
manifested. Then allow the PDC to do a full synchronization.
