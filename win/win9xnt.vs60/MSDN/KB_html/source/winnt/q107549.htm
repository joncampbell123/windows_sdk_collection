<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
You may receive the following error message when you try to connect to a
postoffice in Microsoft Mail for Windows for Workgroups or Windows NT from
a Windows NT workstation:
<P>
<PRE>   Mail could not connect to your mail server

</PRE>This article is not applicable to Windows NT 4.x
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
If Mail for Windows for Workgroups is unable to find the MASTER.GLB file in
the GLB subdirectory of the Mail postoffice directory structure, the error
above is displayed. Mail is unable to find MASTER.GLB under the following
conditions:
<P>
<PRE>    - The Workgroup postoffice computer is unavailable.
    - The postoffice directory is not shared.
    - You are using the wrong workgroup postoffice name.
    - The workgroup postoffice name is invalid.
    - Serverpath= line in your Microsoft Mail registry key is incorrect.

</PRE><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
The following information describes these conditions in detail.
<P>
<P><h3>Workgroup Postoffice Computer Unavailable</h3>
 
<P>
To use Microsoft Mail for Windows for Workgroups, one workgroup computer
must be set up as the postoffice. This computer handles user accounts and
mail messages for the workgroup. To provide these services, the postoffice
computer must contain the workgroup postoffice directory structure and it
must be running in 386 enhanced mode
<P>
NOTE: There can be only one postoffice per workgroup.
<P>
<P><h3>The Postoffice Directory is Not Shared</h3>
 
<P>
If the postoffice computer is not sharing the postoffice directory
structure, no one will be able to access the postoffice. Windows for
Workgroups users will be able to work offline, but they will not be able to
receive or send messages. Use File Manager to make sure the postoffice
directory structure is being shared on the postoffice computer.
<P>
<P><h3>Using Wrong Workgroup Postoffice Name</h3>
 
<P>
By default, the workgroup postoffice is named WGPO. However, in your
workgroup, the name may be different. Make sure the name you are using for
the postoffice is correct. (It should be the same as the share name on the
workgroup postoffice computer.)
<P>
<P><h3>Workgroup Postoffice Name is Invalid</h3>
 
<P>
By default, the workgroup postoffice is name WGPO. You can use another name
provided that it doesn't exceed 8 characters and doesn't contain any
spaces.
<P>
For example, changing the share name from "WGPO" to "Post Ofc" (without the
quotation marks) would cause unsuccessful connections. Make sure that the
name each user is trying to connect to matches the name that was used as
the share name on the postoffice computer.
<P>
<P><h3>ServerPath= Line in Microsoft Mail Registry Key is Incorrect</h3>
 
<P>
When you log on, Mail for Windows for Workgroups checks the ServerPath=
line your Microsoft Mail registry key to locate the postoffice computer and
directory structure.
<P>
If you are using universal naming convention (UNC) style path to refer to
the postoffice computer, make sure the computer name and share name are
correct. If you are not sure of the names, you can use File Manager to
connect to the postoffice computer and verify the computer and share names.
<P>
Another resolution may be to use a redirected driver letter (M for example)
for your postoffice. You can do this by doing the following:

<OL><P><LI>From File Manager, connect to the Workgroups Postoffice share. (Make
   sure that the Reconnect At Logon box is selected.)

<P><LI>Open the Registry Editor (REGEDT32.EXE) and go to the following Registry
   Key:
<P>
<P><PRE>      HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Mail\Microsoft Mail
</PRE><P>
   WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-
<P><PRE>      wide problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct
      them. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the
      use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Highlight the ServerPath value and choose String from the Edit menu.

<P><LI>In the String filed, place the drive letter for the connection to the
   Workgroups Postoffice. For example, if you selected M for the drive
   letter of this connection, enter M:\ in the String field.

<P><LI>Quit Registry Editor.
<P>
</OL><h3>Server Name is Invalid</h3>
 
<P>
When you use Windows NT Mail, if you try to join an existing Postoffice and
you specify a server name that has a space in it, the following error
message appears:
<P>
<PRE>   Mail could not connect to your mail server.
