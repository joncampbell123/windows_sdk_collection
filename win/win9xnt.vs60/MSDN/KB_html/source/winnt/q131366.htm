<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When a Windows NT PDC (Primary Domain Controller) is rebooted, event 5712
warnings appear in the event log, indicating that BDC's (Backup Domain
Controller's) attempts to synchronize have failed. The Detail Description
of the error log is:
<P>
<PRE>   The partial synchronization request from the server &lt;BDC_server_name&gt;
   failed with the following error: Access is denied.

</PRE>The Detail Data of the error log is:
<P>
<PRE>   0000: c0000022

</PRE>NOTE: c0000022 is defined as Status_Access_Denied.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When the Netlogon service starts on the rebooted PDC, it sends a pulse to
the BDC indicating that it needs to synchronize with the accounts databases
on the PDC. The BDC responds with a partial synch request. However, a
secure channel with the PDC is required to complete the request. Because
the BDC had a secure channel with the PDC before the PDC was rebooted, it
attempts to submit the partial synch request without establishing a new
secure channel. The request fails with Access Denied. After receiving the
Access Denied status from the PDC, the BDC requests a new secure channel
and completes the partial synch request successfully.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Event 5712 messages due to Access Denied are common immediately after
the reboot of a PDC. They are not necessarily harmful, and do not mean that
the BDC is unable to synchronize with the PDC.
<P>
As a test to see if the 5712 warning is important, force a synchronization
with the PDC from the BDC and check the event log on the BDC. If the
Netlogon messages in the BDC event log indicate that the synchronization
attempt with the PDC was successful, then the warnings on the PDC can be
ignored.
<P>
NOTE: This article discusses a single cause of 5712 errors. If your BDC is
unable to synchronize with the PDC when you force it to in Server Manager,
then the Secure Channel account on the BDC may have an invalid password.
