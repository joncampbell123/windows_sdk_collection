The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you attempt to log on to Windows NT with an existing user account, you
may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Your profile was not successfully loaded but you have been logged on
   with a default system profile. Please correct the problem and log off.

</PRE>When you attempt to log on to Windows NT with a new user account, you may
receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   The operating system was unable to load your profile. Please contact
   your Network Administrator.

</PRE>Also, the Program Files folder and folders located in the
%SystemRoot%\Profiles folder may be named with short file names (standard
8.3 naming). For example, the Program Files folder may be renamed to
Progra~1, and folders located in the %SystemRoot%\Profiles folder may be
renamed to Admini~1, Alluse~1, and Defaul~1.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior can occur if either of the following conditions exists:

<UL><LI>You used a disk tool such as Disk Defragmenter or Msbackup from an
   earlier operating system (such as Microsoft MS-DOS 6.0). These tools
   are not long file name-aware and can damage Windows NT 4.0 system
   folders and files, including  the Program Files folder and folders
   located in the %SystemRoot%\Profiles folder.

<LI>The %SystemRoot%\Profiles\Default User folder is missing or damaged.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this behavior, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Reinstall Windows NT over the existing Windows NT installation to
   re-create the long file names in the %SystemRoot% folder, create a
   new Program Files folder, and create a new default user profile.

<P><LI>Delete the damaged user profiles. When you run Windows NT Setup in step
   1, the Administrator, All Users, and Default User profiles are
   re-created.
<P>
   NOTE: Before you delete a damaged user profile folder, save any
   documents or data files located in the Desktop folder of that user
   profile folder.
<P>
   To delete the damaged user profiles, follow these steps:
<P>
   a. Click Start, point to Programs, and then click Windows NT
<P><PRE>      Explorer.
</PRE><P>
   b. Double-click the %SystemRoot%\Profiles folder.
<P>
   c. Click the first damaged user profile to be deleted. On the File
<P><PRE>      menu, click Delete.
</PRE><P>
   d. Repeat step C until all damaged user profiles are deleted.

<P><LI>Re-create the user profile folder for each individual user by logging
   on to the computer using the user name and password for each user.
   User profile folders are re-created using default settings when a user
   logs on to Windows NT for the first time.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Many programs place files in the Program Files folder. When you use the
procedure in this article to create a new Program Files folder, some
programs may not function properly. You may need to reinstall some programs
after following this procedure.
