The information in this article applies to:

<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
An application that is running in the RealTime priority class (a base
priority of 16) can potentially take so much of the available CPU
resources that no resources will be available for other processes or
threads. This includes a possible "starving" of both the mouse and
keyboard. This implies that the mouse may become unavailable to click
another application to execute an action. It also implies that the
keyboard may not respond if you try to press CTRL+ESC to get the Task
List and Cancel the application.
<P>
To run a process or thread in the RealTime priority class requires
that you either be an administrator, a member of the administrator's
group, or have the Increase Scheduling Priority user right
(SeIncreaseBasePriorityPrivilege) explicitly granted to you.
Administrators must use caution when granting this right to users.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Only Windows 32-bit applications can be scheduled for RealTime and
High priorities. Windows 16-bit, MS-DOS, OS/2, and POSIX applications
may only run at a priority of Normal (maximum base priority of 7).
Also, if a process has a Low priority, all processes spawned from it
(children) will inherit the Low priority, but if the process has a
High priority, all children will be assigned a Normal priority.
<P>
<PRE>   Default Priority Bases
   ----------------------

   Low:        4
   Normal:     7
   High:      13
   RealTime:  24

</PRE>Note that many items can influence this base priority, including user
groups (administrators versus users), how tasking is set up in the
Control Panel System option, and whether the application is in the
foreground or background.
