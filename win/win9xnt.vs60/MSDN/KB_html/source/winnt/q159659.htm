<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article provides troubleshooting ideas for OSPF routers that are not
able to establish an Adjacency. An Adjacency is established when the Link
State database of neighboring routers is fully synchronized.

<OL><P><LI>Ping the neighboring router to ensure basic network connectivity.

<P><LI>Windows NT OSPF routers have Authentication enabled by default. The
   default password is 12345678. Be sure to change the Authentication to
   match all neighboring OSPF routers. The password is configured on a per-
   interface basis on the General tab. Passwords are case sensitive.

<P><LI>Be sure that the Hello and Dead intervals match the Hello and Dead
   intervals of neighboring OSPF routers. By default the Hello interval is
   10 seconds and the Dead interval is 40 seconds. These intervals are
   configured on a per-interface basis in the Advanced tab.

<P><LI>Be sure that area border routers (ABR) are on the backbone 0.0.0.0. Area
   border routers are routers that are part of two or more different OSPF
   areas. An ABR does not have to be physically on the backbone if a
   virtual link has been created, attaching it to the backbone. Virtual
   links are configured globally on the Virtual Interfaces tab. Virtual
   neighbors must be configured using the router ID, not just any IP
   address.

<P><LI>If the routers are on a non-broadcast multi access (NBMA) network, such
   as X.25 or frame relay, their neighbors must be manually configured
   because neighbors are unable to be found through multicast. Neighbors
   are configured on a per-interface basis on the Neighbors tab. Neighbors
   must be configured using the IP address of the neighbor to which the
   link state information needs to be sent.

<P><LI>If you have an NBMA network, such as X.25 or frame relay, that is in a
   hub and spoke configuration, be sure to set the router priority on spoke
   routers to 0 and the hub router to 1 or greater. A router priority of 0
   means that the router cannot become a designated router (DR) . The hub
   router must be the DR because it is the only router that can communicate
   directly with all other routers. The router priority defaults to 1 and
   is set on a per-interfaces basis on the General tab

<P><LI>On broadcast (token ring, Ethernet, FDDI) or NBMA networks (X.25, frame
   relay), be sure that all routers do not have a priority of 0. At least
   one router needs a priority of 1 or greater to become the designated
   router.

<P><LI>Be sure neighboring routers are configured correctly with the same area
   ID.

<P><LI>When you configure an OSPF router, be careful not to duplicate router
   identification numbers. The router identification number should uniquely
   identify a router throughout the OSPF autonomous system.
