<UL><LI>Microsoft Zero Administration Kit for Windows NT Workstation 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how to use the Con2prt.exe tool included with the
Zero Administration Kit for Windows NT 4.0 (ZAK) to connect to a network
printer. You are not required to install ZAK to use the Con2prt.exe tool.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Con2prt.exe tool is a command-line utility for adding or removing
network printers on Windows NT-based computers. You can use the
Con2prt.exe tool in a Windows NT login script or in conjunction with an
unattended setup of Windows NT. To install a network printer with the
Con2prt.exe tool, use the appropriate method.
<P>
<P><h3>Run the Con2prt.exe Tool from a Login Script</h3>
 
<P>
Use the Con2prt.exe tool to connect to a network printer in a Windows NT
login script. To do so, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Copy the Con2prt.exe tool to the %SystemRoot% folder of the Windows
   NT-based client computer.

<P><LI>Configure your Windows NT login script to run the Con2prt.exe tool.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: You can display the command-line switches for the Con2prt.exe tool
by typing "con2prt /?" or "con2prt /h" (without quotation marks).
<P>
<P><h3>Run the Con2prt.exe Tool from a Batch File on the Distribution Share</h3>
 
<P>
Use a batch file located in the $$ folder of your Windows NT Setup
distribution share to run the Con2prt.exe tool. You can automate the
installation of the batch file with the tools used for an unattended
installation of Windows NT. To do so, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Copy the Con2prt.exe file to the $$ folder that is located in the $OEM$
   folder of your Windows NT Setup distribution share.

<P><LI>Create a batch file in the $$ folder that runs the Con2prt.exe tool.
<P>
   NOTE: Files located in the $$ folder of the distribution share are
   copied to the %SystemRoot% folder of the Windows NT-based client
   computer during Windows NT Setup.

<P><LI>Confirm that your Unattend.txt file contains the following entry in the
   [unattended] section:
<P>
<P><PRE>      OEMPreInstall = yes
</PRE>
<P><LI>Configure your Cmdlines.txt file to run a registry file that places
   the command to run your batch file in the Run key of the registry on
   the Windows NT-based client computer.
<P>
   NOTE: You cannot run the Con2prt.exe tool directly from the
   Cmdlines.txt file.
<P>
</OL>For additional information about configuring the distribution share and
unattended setup parameters for Windows NT, see the Automating Windows NT
Setup Deployment Guide, available for download from the following
