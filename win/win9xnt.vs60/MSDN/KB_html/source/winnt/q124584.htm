<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Although Windows NT provides dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP)
services, and DHCP is based on the Bootstrap protocol (BOOTP), Windows NT
does not provide BOOTP services.
<P>
NOTE: The latest Microsoft Windows NT version 4.0 U.S. Service Pack adds
some BOOTP functionality to the Microsoft DHCP Server component. For
additional information, please see the README.TXT file included with the
Service Pack, or see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3 Readme.txt File (40-bit)

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Windows NT uses DHCP to retrieve information from a DHCP server, but does
not retrieve information directly related to diskless booting, nor does it
provide BOOTP services to manage and initiate diskless booting.
<P>
BOOTP, as defined in RFC 951 (with clarifications and extensions applied in
RFC 1542), is both a service and a protocol (used to implement the
service). The BOOTP service allows a diskless client to access the BOOTP
server host to determine (using programmable read-only memory [PROM] code),
its own IP address, the address of a BOOTP server host, and boot file to
load into memory. The diskless client can then boot itself.
<P>
Windows NT does not provide BOOTP server code to locate and indicate (to
the diskless client) an NT boot image file, nor does it provide services to
allow a BOOTP client to boot Windows NT.
<P>
<P><h3>Using a BOOTP Router to Relay DHCP Frames</h3>
 
<P>
A router with BOOTP relay-agent capability (clarified in RFC 1542) can
recognize BOOTP protocol frames and process (relay) them appropriately.
Because routers see DHCP frames as BOOTP frames, a router with BOOTP relay-
agent capability can relay DHCP frames just like standard BOOTP frames.
<P>
NOTE: Because this router-based BOOTP relay-agent capability was not
clearly defined until RFC 1542, use a router that conforms to RFC 1542.
<P>
For more information, please refer to RFCs 951 (BOOTP), 1542
(Clarifications and extensions for BOOTP), 1541 (DHCP), and 1534
(Interoperation between DHCP and BOOTP).
