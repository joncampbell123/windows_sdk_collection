The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51 and 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51 and 4.0

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The newest NetFlex 3 cards that ship with some Compaq computers are not
detected during Windows NT setup. The drivers for these cards have the same
name as the drivers for the old NetFlex 3 cards, and also work with the old
NetFlex 3 cards. Replacing the old NetFlex 3 drivers with the new NetFlex 3
drivers in the I386\Drvlib.nic folder does not allow the new drivers to be
loaded for the old cards.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Netoemdh.inf that ships with Windows NT does not support these new
cards or drivers.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Compaq has supplied a new Ntoemdh.inf that allows Windows NT to detect and
load the drivers for these new cards, and allows the new drivers to be
loaded for the older NetFlex 3 cards as well. Follow the steps below:

<OL><P><LI>Delete the existing Netoemdh.in_ file from the I386 folder of the
   distribution share.

<P><LI>Copy the Netoemdh.inf file from the Compaq Software Support pages at
   <B><A href="http://www.compaq.com/support/files/desktops/softpaqs/pages/nf3ntds.html">http://www.compaq.com/support/files/Desktops/softpaqs/pages/NF3NTDS.html</A></B>
   to the I386 folder of the distribution share. This file has been
   modified to support newer revisions of the NetFlex 3 chipset.

<P><LI>Replace the files in the I386\Drvlib.nic\Netflex3 folder with the
   updated driver files from the Compaq Software Support pages at
   <B><A href="http://www.compaq.com/support/files/index.html">http://www.compaq.com/support/files/index.html,</A></B> or with the drivers that
   shipped with the computer.
