<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Setup may halt after the GUI-based portion of Setup is finished and you
are prompted to restart the computer. During the restart, the screen may
go blank with the cursor in the upper left corner of the screen. When this
occurs, pressing CTRL+ALT+DELETE may not work to restart the computer. You
may have to turn the computer off and on to restart it.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior can occur if the computer has an older or outdated BIOS.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Upgrade the computer's BIOS to the latest version.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The computer's BIOS (Basic Input Output System) controls the basic hard-
ware devices on the computer. This includes, but is not limited to, memory
(RAM), floppy disk drives, IDE hard disk drives, internal and external
caches, and other miscellaneous functions. Because Windows NT interacts
closely with the hardware on the computer, it is important to have the
latest version of the BIOS for your computer.
<P>
In many cases, the BIOS can be upgraded with a program that initializes
the BIOS EPROM and replaces the firmware with the latest version. This is
called a "Flash BIOS" upgrade. Flash BIOS upgrades can be downloaded from
the computer or motherboard manufacturer's Web site or BBS in many cases.
However, some computer manufacturers may require that the motherboard be
replaced entirely to upgrade the BIOS.
<P>
Please refer to the manufacturer of your computer or motherboard for
information about the latest BIOS version and upgrade options.
