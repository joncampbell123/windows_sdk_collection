The Compaq Proliant computer comes with built-in CD-ROM and tape drives.
Both of these drives are attached to the Compaq Fast-SCSI-2 controller and
are fully supported under Windows NT by the NCR 53c710 driver. However, you
may want to obtain Compaq's SCSI driver so that you will be able to use
Compaq's Insight Manager to monitor SCSI statistics. The driver is
available from Compaq's Support Software Diskette in the Compaq forum on
CompuServe. The latest version at the time of this writing is 1.04B
(Softpaq 772).
