The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When a Macintosh user logs on to a Windows NT Advanced Server running
Services for Macintosh, any error messages displayed will be different
depending on which user authentication module (UAM) is used. If the
Apple UAM is used, then regardless of what the error is, the following
error message appears:
<P>
<PRE>   Sorry, your password is incorrect. Please reenter it.

</PRE>A more informative error message is displayed only when using the
Microsoft UAM (MSUAM). These errors and their messages are documented
later in this document.
<P>
The only exception to the above is when the user's password has
expired and must be changed. In this case, the Apple UAM displays the
following message:
<P>
<PRE>   Your password must be changed. Please set a new password.

</PRE>The MSUAM displays the following message:
<P>
<PRE>   Your password has expired on this server.
   (Then the user will be presented with the Change Password dialog box.)

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following error messages are displayed only if the Macintosh user
used the MSUAM when trying to log on to a Windows NT Advanced Server
Running SFM.
<P>
<PRE>   You are not allowed to log on to this server at this time.
   Try again later.

</PRE>This message indicates that the user's profile does not allow the user
to login at that time, or that day. This is set in the User Manager:
User Properties: Hours dialog box.
<P>
<PRE>   You do not have permission to log on to this server from this
   workstation.

</PRE>This messages indicates that the user's profile restricts which
computers they may log on to. This is set in the User Manager: User
Properties: Logon From dialog box.
<P>
<PRE>   Sorry; your user name is unknown or your password is incorrect.
   Logon failed.

</PRE>This message indicates one of several things. The account may have
expired; the expiration date of an account may be set in the User
Manager: User Properties: Account Information dialog box. Or the
account's name or password has not been entered correctly on either
the Macintosh or the Windows NT Advanced Server.
<P>
<PRE>   Your account is currently disabled on this server.

</PRE>This error message indicates that the user's account has been set to
Account Disabled in the User Manager: User Properties dialog box.
