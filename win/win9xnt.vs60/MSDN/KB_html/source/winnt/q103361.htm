<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
In Windows NT, if you lose your connection to a network printer and it
is set as the default printer, 16-bit Windows-based applications may
load significantly slower than usual or appear to hang completely.
<P>
When 16-bit Windows-based applications, such as Write, attempt to
load, they may search for a printer. If the printer is a network
printer and the connection has been broken, the application may load
very slowly or appear to hang.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, install a local printer and set it as the
default, reestablish the network connection, or remove the network
connection entirely.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>In Print Manager, connect to a network printer and set it as your
   default printer.

<P><LI>Close Print Manager and return to Program Manager.

<P><LI>Open Write from the Accessories group twice.
<P>
   NOTE: The reason for doing this twice is that if no other 16-bit
   Windows-based applications have been loaded, the first launch of
   Write will take longer because it has to load the 16-bit Windows
   Subsystem.

<P><LI>Notice the time Write takes to load.

<P><LI>Close all instances of Write.

<P><LI>Unplug the network cable from the network card.
<P>
   NOTE: Consult with your Network Administrator before removing any
   network hardware.

<P><LI>Restart Write and notice the extra time it takes to load.
<P></OL>
