The information in this article applies to:

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Windows NT supports a hidden permission called File Delete Child (FDC) on
NTFS volumes. Users who have full control permission on a volume or
directory also have the FDC permission. This permission allows a user to
delete files at the root level of the directory where they have full
control, even if they do not have any permissions on the specific file
itself.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The FDC permission only gives the user the right to delete files at the
root level of the directory in which they have full control rights, they
cannot delete sub directories, or files nested within sub directories. The
FDC permission is based on the concept that if a user owns a directory,
they should be able to delete files within that directory, even if they do
not have specific permissions for every file.
<P>
If an administrator does not wish to grant a user the FDC permission, the
administrator can use the special permissions option and grant the user
every permission except full control.
<P>
This permission was created to maintain POSIX compliance. It is equivalent
to the UNIX directory write permission. The behavior of this permission
cannot be changed in the User Interface or through the registry.
<P>
The following example illustrates the use of the FDC permission.
Listed below are the default permissions of both root directory of drive C
and the Windows NT system root directory, normally C:\Winnt.
<P>
<PRE>   Everyone    Full Control ( All ) ( All )

</PRE>In this case, everyone has full control of this directory, and can delete
any file at the root level of either directory. If the guest account was
enabled, even a guest could delete a file, regardless of any special
permissions the file itself may have.
<P>
For example, suppose you add the file MyFile.txt to the root of drive C.
You then set the permissions to:
<P>
<PRE>     Administrators     Full Control ( All )

</PRE>The Everyone group is removed. If you log on to the computer as an ordinary
user, you can see the file, but not open it. You can however delete the
file.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>To Deny Delete Permission to the Everyone Group</h3>
 
<P>
If you wish to deny the Everyone group the right to delete files, do not
remove the Everyone group from the root directory. If this is done, the
System and Administrators will not have access to the system files and it
may not be possible to log on when the system restarts. For more
information, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:

   TITLE     : Removing Permissions to an NTFS Partition May Prevent
               Startup

</PRE>To prevent the Everyone group from being able to delete files in the root
directory, assign Read, Write, and Execute (RWX) privileges through Special
Directory Access. It is also necessary to explicitly provide the system
with full control. The root directory permissions should now be displayed
as the following:
<P>
<PRE>   Administrators    Full Control ( All )( All )
   Everyone    Special Access  ( RWX )( RWX )
   SYSTEM      Full Control ( All )( All )
</PRE>
