<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After you install the CalComp Wintab32 Digitizer Services and Driver
version 3.2 for Windows NT 3.51, a serial mouse does not work and the
following system events are logged in the Event Viewer:
<P>
<PRE>   Event ID: 3
   Source: Serial
   Description: User configuration data for parameter COM2 overriding
   firmware configuration data.

   Event ID: 11
   Source: Serial
   Description: The hardware resources for COMx are already in use by
   another device.

   Event ID: 22
   Source:Serial
   Description: A conflict has been detected between two drivers which
   claimed two overlapping Io port regions. Driver ccntdrv, with device
   &lt;\Device\PointerPort0.Translated&gt;, claimed an IO port range with
   starting address in data address 0x28 and 0x2c, and length in data
   address 0x30.

   Event ID: 22
   Source:Serial
   Description: A conflict has been detected between two drivers which
   claimed two overlapping Io port regions. Driver Serial, with device
   &lt;\Device\Serial1.Translated&gt;, claimed an IO port range with starting
   address in data address 0x28 and 0x2c, and length in data address 0x30.

   Event ID: 24
   Source: Serial
   Description: A conflict has been detected between two drivers which
   claimed equivalent IRQs. Driver CCNTDRV, with device
   &lt;\Device\PointerPort0.Translated&gt;, claimed an interrupt with Level in
   data address 0x28, vector in data address 0x2c and Affinity in data
   address 0x30.

   Event ID: 24
   Source: Serial
   Description: A conflict has been detected between two drivers which
   claimed equivalent IRQs. Driver Serial, with device
   &lt;\Device\Serial2.Translated&gt;, claimed an interrupt with Level in data
   address 0x28, vector in data address 0x2c and Affinity in data
   address 0x30.

</PRE>NOTE: The COM ports, IRQ and addresses in system events mentioned above
will vary depending on the system configuration.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
The system events that appear in the Event Viewer are by design.
<P>
To correct the problem with the serial mouse:

<OL><P><LI>Make sure that the Calcomp Digitizer drivers are installed by following
   the instructions included with the Calcomp drivers. Turn the digitizer
   power off and verify that the digitizer tablet is properly connected to
   the computer.

<P><LI>Verify that the settings of the serial mouse, the digitizer, and other
   hardware peripherals. Make sure that each device is using a unique IRQ,
   COM port and Base I/O port address. In Windows NT, run Control Panel
   Ports and select the COM port. Click Settings and then click Advanced to
   view the IRQ and Base I/O Port Address settings.
<P>
</OL>If there are no resource conflicts, proceed to step 3. If you have detected
resource conflicts (especially with the digitizer), contact Calcomp
Technical Support at (800) 458-5888 and see the following articles in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

</PRE><P><LI>In Control Panel Devices, verify that Serial has started.

<P><LI>In Control Panel Devices, select Sermouse and click Startup. For Startup
   Type, select System. Click OK and quit Control Panel.

<P><LI>Shut down and restart Windows NT.
