The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Although you did not use an evaluation copy of the Windows NT 4.0 CD-ROM
to install Windows NT, you may receive the following message:
<P>
<PRE>   The evaluation period for this installation of Windows NT has expired.
   This system will shutdown in one hour. To restore access to this
   installation of Windows NT, please upgrade this installation using a
   licensed distribution of this product.

</PRE>One hour after you receive this message, your computer stops responding
(hangs) while displaying an error message similar to the following message
on a blue screen:
<P>
<PRE>   *** STOP 0x00000098 (0x647CDCB0,0x01BC9900,0x0002A300,0x00000000)
   END_OF_NT_EVALUATION_PERIOD

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The boot floppy disks used for your installation of Windows NT were
created from a Windows NT 4.0 evaluation CD-ROM. Using boot floppy disks
from an evaluation copy of Windows NT invokes a trial period for that
installation of Windows NT. When the trial period has expired, Windows NT
stops every hour.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this problem, upgrade the evaluation copy of Windows NT
Server or Workstation with the full retail version using either of the
following methods:

<UL><LI>Start Windows NT Setup using the boot floppy disks supplied with the
   full retail version of Windows NT 4.0. If the boot floppy disks
   supplied with the full retail version are no longer available, you can
   create a new set from the full retail CD-ROM. For more information, see
   the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../winnt/q131735.htm">Q131735</A></B>
<PRE></PRE>      TITLE     : How to Create Windows NT Boot Floppy Disks

</PRE><LI>Start Windows NT Setup directly from the full retail CD-ROM by using
   the Winnt.exe or Winnt32.exe command.
<P>
</UL>NOTE: Upgrading your installation using the upgrade retail version of
Windows NT 4.0 is not possible. The full retail version of Windows NT 4.0
must be used. For more information, see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : WinNT 4.0 Upgrade CD Will Not Upgrade WinNT 4.0
               Installation

</PRE>NOTE: Upgrading Windows NT 4.0 over an installation of Windows NT 4.0
with Service Pack 2 or later applied may prevent the computer from
starting. You must uninstall the Service Pack prior to starting the
upgrade. To remove Service Pack 2 or later, start the Service Pack
installation program and choose the Uninstall The Service Pack option when
you are prompted.
<P>
In addition, if you have uninstalled Service Pack 3, you must make sure
that the Windows NT security files are not replaced during the upgrade. To
do so, follow these steps to perform the upgrade:

<OL><P><LI>Copy the I386 folder from the Windows NT 4.0 full retail CD-ROM to the
   hard disk. In this folder, rename the following files as shown below:
<P>
<PRE>      Original name   New name
      ----------------------------
      Samsrv.dl_      Samsrv.org
      Samlib.dl_      Samlib.org
      Winlogon.ex_    Winlogon.org

</PRE><P><LI>Expand the Windows NT Service Pack 3 files in a separate folder with
   the following command:
<P>
<P><PRE>      nt4sp3_i.exe /x
</PRE>
<P><LI>Copy the following files from the Service Pack 3 folder to the I386
   folder you created:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Samsrv.dll
      Samlib.dll
      Winlogon.exe
</PRE>
<P><LI>Click Start, click Run, type the following command to begin
   the full retail installation, and then click OK.
<P>
<P><PRE>      &lt;Path&gt;\winnt32.exe /b
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;Path&gt; is the path to the I386 folder you created.

<P><LI>When you are prompted during the Windows NT Setup program, choose the
   upgrade option.
<P>
