<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you are using Remote Access Service (RAS) to call a computer that is
not on a network (such as a computer at your home) from a networked
computer (such as a computer at your office), you are unable to browse the
non-networked computer for computer names and share names.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Browsing is automatically disabled in Windows NT if no network other than
RAS is present. This behavior is based on the assumption that people will
only call from the non-networked (home) computer to the networked (work)
computer, and therefore have no need to browse the non-networked (home)
computer.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem:

<OL><P><LI>In the NCP/RAS/Configure/Advanced dialog box, make sure the Entire
   Network option is selected.

<P><LI>Make sure the non-networked (home) computer is a member of the domain or
   workgroup of the network where it is called from.

<P><LI>In the NCP/Add Adapter dialog box, select the Microsoft Loopback driver,
   and then choose Install.
<P>
   -or-
<P>
   Install an additional network card and driver (in addition to RAS).
<P>
</OL>NOTE: You now have a fake network and options in File Manager and other
applications appear to be active and functional, but are not functional
unless you are having a RAS session to another machine.
