<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
You make a server a backup domain controller. After setup is complete,
you attempt to logon to the administrative account using the correct
password. The password validation fails. However, logging on with no
password to the administrative account is successful.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
A backup domain controller replicates its database from the current
domain controller. The initial replication occurs after the Netlogon
service is started during the first boot after installation has
completed. Before replication occurs (and user account databases are
in sync), the backup domain controller has the default database (which
includes the Administrator account with no password). Since the
initial replication can take an extended period of time (several
minutes for a large domain), there is a period after the initial boot
during which you can log on to the backup domain controller using the
accounts in the default database, but not those accounts in the
domain.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Wait for database replication to finish before attempting to log on
from a registered account.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Advanced
Server version 3.1. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
