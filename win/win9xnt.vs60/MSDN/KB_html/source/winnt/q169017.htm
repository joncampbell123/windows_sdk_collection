<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Cluster Server (MSCS) for Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition
(NTS/E) provides higher availability and easier manageability for important
resources and applications. MSCS runs as a system service and monitors the
health of resources defined within the cluster. Cluster resources are
organized by groups of similar or dependent resources.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Using MSCS, groups of resources may be defined to develop logical groupings
for important resources. Some examples of resource types may be
applications, services, disks, file shares, print spoolers, TCP/IP
addresses, network names, and so on. Other types of resources within the
cluster may be added by software developers through custom DLLs if
necessary. Many applications and services may not require special handling
and may use generic resource types as provided with the product.
<P>
Groups of resources allow similar or dependent resources to be grouped
together. For clients to access resources within a group, the group must
have a network name and IP address resource associated with it.
<P>
These groups of resources may be owned and managed by any member computer
(node) in the cluster. In the event of a failure within a group, the
cluster software transfers the group of resources and data to a remaining
node in the cluster. The network name, address, and other resources for the
moved group remain with the group after the transfer. Therefore, clients on
the network may still access the same resources by the same network name
and IP address -- despite the name of the computer that offers the
resources. Thus, these resources become more available. Groups may be moved
automatically because of a resource failure within the group, or by an
administrator for load balancing or administrative purposes.
<P>
Multiple groups may be created within the cluster so that resources may be
distributed among available nodes in the cluster. The ability to distribute
groups independently allows the workload to be handled by more than one
cluster node. Administrators may use each cluster node for normal day to
day operations. In the event of a failure, the groups handled by a failing
node will be automatically transferred to surviving nodes within the
cluster.
<P>
Resource dependencies may be established within a group to ensure
availability of specific resources before other resources attempt to go
online. For example, a file share resource may require a physical disk to
be online to provide data to clients.
<P>
Another example of resource dependencies may be for a Web server resource
that needs an IP address to start. If you create the resource with a
dependency on the IP address resource, the web service will not attempt to
start until this becomes available.
<P>
For more information on groups and resources within MSCS, consult the MSCS
Administrator's Guide.
