<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article discusses Windows NT UAS replication and the differences
between Windows NT and Microsoft LAN Manager.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The NetLogon service on each Windows NT Advanced Server replicates
both the security accounts manager (SAM) and local security authority
(LSA) security databases. The security databases are replicated from
the Domain Controller in the domain to all the Windows NT Advanced
Servers in the domain. (The security database is also replicated to
LAN Manager BDCs in the Windows NT domain by using the same protocols
and procedures that LAN Manager uses.)
<P>
Replication does not apply to Windows NT workstations. The security
databases are actually three separate databases: the SAM Accounts
database, the SAM Built-in database, and the LSA database. Each
database is replicated as described below. The SAM Built-in database
contains all the default local groups installed with the system. The
SAM Accounts database include all other SAM objects: users, global
groups, site-specific local groups, and global security policy. The
LSA database contains user rights, secret objects, and trusted domain
objects.
<P>
Security database replication is "pull" replication. That is, each
Advanced Server in the domain independently recognizes that
replication is needed and then makes API calls to the Domain
Controller to pick up the requisite changes. Each Advanced Server then
updates its own security database.
<P>
The replication paradigm is almost identical to that used by LAN
Manager. Two types of replication occur: "Full Sync" replication and
"Partial Sync" replication. These are described below.
<P>
<P><h3>Full Sync Replication</h3>
 
<P>
Full sync replication copies the entire security database from the
Domain Control to the Windows NT Advanced Server. Full sync
replication occurs when any one of the following circumstances exists:

<UL><LI>When NetLogon starts on the Advanced Server and any of the
   following are true:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - If the netlogon\parameters\update field in the registry is TRUE.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - If the Advanced Server was doing a full sync replication when
      NetLogon was last stopped.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - If this is the first boot after installation.
</PRE>
<LI>If the Domain Controller changes.

<LI>If the user interface (UI) forces a full sync replication.

<LI>If the Domain Controller tells the Advanced Server to do full sync
   replication with any of the following conditions:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - If the change log, %SystemDirectory%\netlogon.chg, wraps.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - If the Domain Controller crashes in the middle of a previous
      full sync replication.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - If the serial number of a database wraps.
</PRE>
<LI>If the Advanced Server, gets an error from SAM or the LSA while
   updating the database on a partial sync replication.
<P>
</UL>To do full sync replication, the Advanced Server performs a remote
I_NetDatabaseSync API call to the Domain Controller. I_NetDatabaseSync
returns up to 128K of security database data on each call. NetLogon
unpacks the received data and updates the information in the security
database. If all the data wasn't retrieved in a single call, the
Advanced Server calls I_NetDatabaseSync again to retrieve more data.
This process is repeated for the SAM Account database, the SAM
Built-in database, and the LSA database.
<P>
<P><h3>Partial Sync Replication</h3>
 
<P>
Partial sync replication ensures individual changes made to the
security database on the Domain Controller are updated on the other
Advanced Servers in the domain. The Domain Controller sends a periodic
pulse to the other Advanced Servers in the domain. The pulse message
contains the serial number of each database. Each Advanced Server
checks to see if the serial number in the message is greater than the
one on its local copy of the database. If it is, that Advanced
Server asks for the changes by sending an I_NetDatabaseDeltas API call
to the Domain Controller. I_NetDatabaseDeltas returns up to 128K of
security database data on each call. NetLogon unpacks the received
data and updates the information in the security database. If all the
data wasn't retrieved in a single call, the Advanced Server calls
I_NetDatabaseDeltas again to retrieve more data.
<P>
The pulse message is sent to the \mailslot\net\netlogon second-class
mailslot. The pulse message is first sent to all Windows NT Advanced
Servers in the domain by sending it to the XXX&lt;1C&gt; NetBIOS group name where
"XXX" is the name of the domain and "&lt;1C&gt;" is the hexadecimal value of
the 16th byte of the name. All Windows NT Advanced Servers in the
domain register this global group name and receive this mailslot
message. The NBT (NetBIOS over TCP/IP) transport treats this &lt;1C&gt; name
specially. It first broadcasts to the group name and then does individual
sends to all machines in domain "XXX" as determine by the lmhosts file.
This ensures the mailslot send reaches all Advanced Servers in the
domain even if they reside on a different subnet than the Domain
Controller. The NetLogon service on the Domain Controller repeats this
mailslot send to each LAN Manager server in the domain (since they
don't have the &lt;1C&gt; address registered). The mailslot message is sent
individually to each server that is a member of the SERVERS global
group name. You should ensure that the SERVERS global group only
contains member of this domain to prevent the LAN Manager server from
receiving mailslot messages from a domain of which it is not a member.
<P>
The Domain Controller keeps track of the changes made to the security
databases by recording them in the change log,
%SystemDirectory%\netlogon.chg. Each change to the security databases is
recorded in the change log along with the serial number of the change. (The
serial number is maintained separately for each of the three security
databases. It is incremented once for each change to the databases.) Later,
when an Advanced Server requests a particular change from the Domain
Controller (by calling I_NetDatabaseDeltas), the Domain Controller consults
the change log to determine what the change was.
<P>
<P><h3>Secure Channel</h3>
 
<P>
Each Windows NT Advanced Server sets up a secure channel to the Domain
Controller in the domain. A server trust account is set up for the
Advanced Server on the Domain Controller. This account is set up
either from the Server Manager (srvmgr) by selecting Add to Domain
from the Computer menu or directly when the Windows NT Advanced Server
is set up if an administrator account name is specified when the
Advanced Server joins the domain. At this time, the password on the
account is set to a well-known constant (the server name in lowercase,
truncated to 14 characters).
<P>
In either case, when the Advanced Server is set up, it stores the
password for the account in LSA secret storage in a secret file named
$machine.acc. The NetLogon service on the Advanced Server immediately
changes this default password the first time it is started and once a
week thereafter to ensure it is kept secret.
<P>
To set up the secure channel, the Advanced Server calls
I_NetServerRequestChallenge, passing the Domain Controller a
challenge. The challenge is a pseudo-random number based on the time
of day and a serial number. Both the Advanced Server and the Domain
Controller use the two challenges and the password known by each
machine to compute a Session Key. Each machine then computes a
credential as its own challenge encrypted by the Session Key. The
Advanced Server then calls I_NetServerAuthenticate, passing the Domain
Controller its credential and then returning the Domain Controller's
credential. Each machine local recomputes its partners credential,
thereby verifying that the partner knows the shared password. The
I_NetDatabaseSync and the I_NetDatabaseDeltas application program
interface (API) functions are only valid across this secure channel to
prevent others from calling these APIs and getting a copy of the
security databases.
