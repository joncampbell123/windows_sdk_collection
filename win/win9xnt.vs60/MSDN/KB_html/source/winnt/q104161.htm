<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
While you are using Microsoft Windows NT, if you move a User from one
User Group to another User Group, this may cause the User's previous
persistent connections to be lost. Once in the new User Group, any
network connection made may not be persistent.
<P>
For example: A user who starts out in the Administrators group and is
then moved to the Power Users group loses persistent connection
functionality. The connections while in the Power Users group will
never be persistent.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.1
and Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1. We are researching this
problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Logon to a Windows NT computer as an Administrator.

<P><LI>In the User Manager, create a new user "Test" and add it to the
    Administrators group. Set any desired password.

<P><LI>Log off and then log on as "Test."

<P><LI>In File Manager, verify that Reconnect At Logon is selected in
    the Connect Network Drive dialog box.

<P><LI>From the Disk menu, choose Connect Network Drive to connect
    drive X to \\SERVER1\SHARE (whatever server is available).

<P><LI>Log off and then log on again as "Test." Drive X will be
    reconnected to \\SERVER1\SHARE.

<P><LI>Log off, then log on as an Administrator.

<P><LI>In the User Manager, remove the "Test" user from the
    Administrators group and add "Test" to the Power Users group.

<P><LI>Log off and then log on as "Test." Drive X will not be reconnected
    to \\SERVER1\SHARE.

<P><LI>In File Manager, verify that Reconnect At Logon is STILL selected,
    and connect drive Y to \\SERVER2\SHARE.

<P><LI>Log off and then log on as "Test" again. Neither drive X nor drive
    Y is reconnected even though in File Manager, Reconnect At Logon is
    still selected.
<P>
    In the Registry, HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows
    NT\CurrentVersion\Network\Persistent Connections lists both
    \\SERVER1\SHARE and \\SERVER2\SHARE, and Save Connections=YES,
    but HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Network\P and Q are unavailable.

<P><LI>Log off and then log on as an Administrator.

<P><LI>Move "Test" out of the Power Users group and back into the
    Administrators group.

<P><LI>Log off and then log on as "Test". X: will be reconnected.
    Subsequent network connections while "Test" is an Administrator
    will be persistent if Connect At Logon is selected.
