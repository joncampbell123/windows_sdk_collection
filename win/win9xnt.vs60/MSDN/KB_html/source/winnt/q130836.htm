<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In the Microsoft Windows NT domain environment, it is not possible to
view a list of all currently validated users logged into a domain.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
You can run Server Manager and choose Show Domain Members Only from the
View Menu to view a list of computers running Windows NT that are members
of the selected domain. This is a list of computer accounts and is not an
indication if the computer is running or has been validated by its primary
domain.
<P>
If Show Domain Members is not selected, browsing information is
incorporated into the list of computers. Domain member computers that are
active will have a non-gray computer icon along with the version number of
Windows NT. Windows For Workgroup computers that are using the domain name
for their workgroup name will also be added to the list when they are
active, and removed from the list when they are inactive. This does not
indicate if the computer has been validated by the domain.
