<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
An error message similar to one of the following appears in your system log
(as seen with Event Viewer), although the source can be any controller name
(for example, Atdisk, Atapi, or Sparrow):
<P>
<PRE>   Event ID:    9
   Source:      aic78xx
   Description: The device, \Device\ScsiPort0, did not respond within the
                timeout period.

-or-

   Event ID:    11
   Source:      aic78xx
   Description: The driver detected a controller error on Device\ScsiPort0.

</PRE>This article discusses troubleshooting steps to resolve the Event ID: 9 or
Event ID: 11 error messages.
<P>
In almost all cases, these messages are being posted due to hardware
problems with either the controller or, more likely, a device that is
attached to the controller in question. The hardware problems can be
associated with poor cabling, incorrect termination or transfer rate
settings, lazy or slow device responses to relinquish the SCSI bus, a
faulty device or, in very rare cases, a poorly written device driver.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following are some troubleshooting tips to help diagnose and pinpoint
the problem:

<UL><LI>Read the SCSI controller manufacturer's technical manual to determine
   the termination requirements. Many modern SCSI controllers require
   active terminators (at least one of the devices on the bus must provide
   termination power). Proper termination involves both a terminator
   (resistor) and a device that supplies a signal to the bus for
   termination power. The SCSI-2 standard specifies that a controller
   (initiator) must supply termination power. Therefore, any controller
   that claims to be SCSI-2 compatible probably does supply termination
   power, but you should check if you are unsure. Also, many devices,
   especially drives, give you the option of providing termination power;
   if you have a jumper on the drive that reads Trmpwr, you should enable
   this jumper.

<LI>If both internal and external SCSI devices are attached, make sure the
   last device on each SCSI chain is terminated, and that intermediary
   devices are not.

<LI>If only a single SCSI chain is used (either all internal or external),
   ensure the last device of the SCSI chain is terminated and the SCSI
   controller itself is terminated. This is usually a BIOS setting.

<LI>Check for loose or poor quality SCSI cabling. When you have a long
   chain of cables with mixed internal and external cabling, you run
   the risk of degrading the signal. Even though the SCSI specification
   may specify a long distance, the specification assumes cabling that
   allows no leakage or interference, and the reality is generally a
   shorter distance. Whenever you have 6-foot or longer external cables,
   you should replace them with 3-foot cables.

<LI>Note when the event messages are posted and try to determine if it
   coincides with certain processing schedules (such as backups) or heavy
   disk processing. This will help to determine what device may be causing
   the errors.
<P>
   NOTE: The reason that drives tend to have these types of problems under
   heavy stress is often slow microprocessors. In a multitasking
   environment, the processor may not be fast enough to process all the
   I/O commands that come in nearly simultaneously.

<LI>Slow the transfer rate settings if the timeouts are associated with
   tape drives - using 5MBS transfer rate usually cures the timeouts.

<LI>Simplify the SCSI/IDE chain by removing devices, or move the device in
   question to another controller. If the problem follows the device,
   you should replace it.

<LI>Check the revision of SCSI controller BIOS and device firmware
   revisions. Contact the manufacturer for the latest revisions. See
   the Checking the Model Number and Firmware Revision section below
   for the procedure on how to do this.

<LI>Check the SCSI device drivers version. The SCSI driver is located
   in the %Systemroot%\System32\Drivers directory. Look at the version
   in the file properties, and check whether the SCSI manufacturer has a
   newer version.

<LI>Remove other controllers that may create bus contention problems.

<LI>A low-level format performed by the SCSI controller may resolve these
   event messages.

<LI>Use a different make or model of any suspect hardware.
<P>
</UL><h3>Checking the Model Number and Firmware Revision</h3>
 
<P>
The model number of the device and firmware revision are in the Windows NT
registry. To check the model number and firmware revision, follow the steps
below.
<P>
WARNING: Using the Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-
wide problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them.
Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of the
Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

<OL><P><LI>Run Regedt32.exe.

<P><LI>Go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Hardware\Devicemap\Scsi\ScsiPortx\ScsiBusx\
   TargetIdx\LogicalUnitIdx, where x varies according to device number.

<P><LI>Look at the REG_SZ identifier value to see the model number and
   firmware revision values. For example, if you see
<P>
<PRE>      SEAGATE ST32430N   0510

   then 0510 is the firmware revision value.

</PRE><P><LI>Record all the device model numbers and firmware revisions, and check
   with the manufacturer for any known issues.
