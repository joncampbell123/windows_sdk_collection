<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
You create a subdirectory on the NetWare server, assign a user to the
subdirectory, and then revoke all permissions to the user. When you run
Nwconv.exe, you are unable to view the permissions on any subdirectory
below \APPS in File Manager, security, permissions on the subdirectory or
any subdirectory below that. You will receive the following error message
when you try to view the permissions:
<P>
<PRE>   The security information for (directory path) are not standard
   and cannot be displayed. Do you want to overwrite the current
   security information?

</PRE><h3>Example</h3>
 
<P>
On a NetWare server:
<P>
SYSVOL
<PRE>   \APPS USER [           ] Assign no permissions assigned.
      \A
      \B

</PRE>On the Windows NT server, after you run Nwconv.exe:
<P>
SYSVOL
<PRE>    \APPS      No permissions have been assigned to the subdirectories
      \A       below APPS including groups that should have permissions
      \B       assigned.


</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
During the conversion, an ACE (access control entry) was added for the user
with no permissions, but not all of the NTFS attributes were correctly
added to the file. Therefore File Manager is unable to view the permission
on the subdirectories.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Nwconv.exe code no longer adds an ACE to the ACL (access control list) for
a user that does not have any permissions assigned to subdirectories.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51.
This problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
