<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article explains how to set up Windows Internet Name Service (WINS)
replication between two or more WINS servers in separate, untrusting
domains.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
It is possible to set up WINS replication between one or more WINS servers
in untrusting domains without having a valid user account in the
untrusting domain.
<P>
To configure replication, the administrator for each WINS server must use
WINS manager and set their respective server(s) to allow replication with
the WINS server in the remote domain(s). (Note: The following steps must
be performed at each WINS server.)
<P>
To configure replication, perform the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Start WINS manager and select the IP address of the WINS server that
   you administer.

<P><LI>On the Server menu, click Replication Partners, and then click Add.

<P><LI>Type the IP address of the remote WINS server (with which replication
   will occur).

<P><LI>Click OK, and a Validate WINS Server message will appear. Type the
   computer name of the opposite WINS server, and then click OK.

<P><LI>Select the IP address of the computer just added (with which
   replication is desired).

<P><LI>Set the Replication options at the bottom of the screen (Set as Push,
   Pull partner, or both), and then click OK.

<P><LI>After each administrator has configured their respective WINS server
   and clicked OK, it is possible to use the Replicate Now option to start
   replication.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: Replication will occur and the remote WINS server's database will be
viewable under the Show Database option. However, without an account with
proper permissions in all domains or servers involved, it is not possible
to use WINS manager to make changes to the remote WINS database.
<P>
Replication can also occur between two separate stand-alone servers that
participate in a workgroup by using the procedures listed above.
