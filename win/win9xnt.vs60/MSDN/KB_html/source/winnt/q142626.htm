<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Windows NT 3.51 the version of LogonUser API prevented a user from
accessing the network while the interactive or batch logon right was given
to that user.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This was due to the fact that the Logon From Network right was removed for
that user. For Windows NT 3.51, the Network logon-type support was removed,
because at the time it was deemed too confusing for the user.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this problem on Windows NT 3.51 Workstation or Server, obtain
the fix referenced below, or upgrade to Windows NT Workstation or Server
version 4.0.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51.
This problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The API confusion was based on the fact that Interactive and Batch logons
allowed the logon session to go out on the net, while the Network logon
would not allow the logon session to go out on the net.  However, with the
exposure of DuplicateTokenEx, this potential confusion has been documented
in the Win32 SDK, and should no longer pose an issue.  The Logonuser API is
called from advapi32.dll.
