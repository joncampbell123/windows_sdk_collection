The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When entering Disk Administrator, Dr. Watson appears and notes that there
has been an error in the application and that it will be closed. This
occurs when a zip drive is present and while the progress bar titled "Disk
Administrator is Initializing" is present.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
A zip drive is the only (or first) device on the SCSI controller with the
lowest base I/O address, making it the controller that is queried first by
Disk Administrator. The failure occurs only if there is not a disk in
the zip drive. Otherwise, the media will be properly reported as Drive 0,
with its size and appropriate logical drive letter.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
There are a few solutions:

<UL><LI>Always insert a disk into the zip drive before launching Disk
   Administrator.

<LI>Connect the zip drive to the SCSI controller that the system's hard
   disk drives are connected to and remove the secondary controller.

<LI>If possible, set the I/O address of the secondary controller to be
   higher (in hexadecimal) than the address of the controller with the
   system's hard disk drive(s).
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. We
are researching this problem and will post new information here as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This occurs when two SCSI controllers are present in a system. PCI-based
SCSI controllers are given very high I/O addresses (such as FC00 - FCFF),
so any additional ISA or EISA SCSI controller present in the system will
have the lower address. When Disk Administrator cannot find the media for
this first device, an error occurs.
