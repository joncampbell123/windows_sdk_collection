The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 and 3.51

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you attempt to delete a group that still contains members, the following
message may appear:
<P>
<PRE>   The following error occurred when trying to delete group &lt;groupname&gt;:
   This operation is not allowed on this special group.

</PRE>This message can be misleading; in actuality, this message could indicate
that certain members still have this group defined as their Primary Group.
<P>
When you attempt to remove certain members from the group, who have this
group set as their Primary Group, you may receive the following error
message:
<P>
<PRE>   The following error occurred changing the properties of the global group
   &lt;groupname&gt;:

   This operation is not allowed on this special group.

</PRE><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To avoid receiving this message, check to see if a group is defined as a
primary group for any members, then reset the primary group if any are
found, before you delete the group.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Workstation and
Server versions 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0. We are researching this problem and
will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
