<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After you install network services for the first time you may receive the
following system events in the event log:
<P>
<PRE>   Event ID: 7023
   Source: Service Control Manager
   Type: Error
   Description: The Server service terminated with the following error:
                Not enough server storage is available to process this
                command.

   Event ID: 7001
   Source: Service Control Manager
   Type: Error
   Description: The Computer browser service depends on the server
                service which failed to start because of the following
                error:  Not enough server storage is available to
                process this command.

</PRE>When you try to start the server service at the command line using the
command:
<P>
<PRE>   NET START SERVER

</PRE>the following error message appears:
<P>
<PRE>   System error 1130 has occurred.
   Not enough server storage is available to process this command.

</PRE>This problem will typically occur with computers that come from the OEM
with Windows NT preinstalled.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem will occur if Windows NT is installed and the latest
Service Pack is installed before the network card is installed. If Srv.sys
is not present when the Service Pack is applied it will not be updated
because Update.exe will only update components that are installed on the
Windows NT system. When Windows NT starts up after the network card
has been installed, Windows NT SRV.SYS is being used. To correctly work
with the rest of the updated system files, the Server service must be
updated to the same version as the installed Service Pack.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Reapply the Windows NT Service Pack.
