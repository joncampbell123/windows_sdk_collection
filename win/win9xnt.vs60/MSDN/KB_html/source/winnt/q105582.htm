<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Your system may randomly stop responding (hang) or disconnect from
network connections while using an Intel EtherExpress 16 network
adapter. Applications that rely on network connections may appear to
hang or generate a message indicating that the network connection can
no longer be found. If you attempt to make a network connection from
within the MS-DOS environment of Windows NT, you may receive the
following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   System error 53 has occurred.
   The network path was not found.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The random network hangs or disconnects when using the Intel
EtherExpress 16 network card may occur at relatively infrequent and
unpredictable times. For this reason, Microsoft has not yet been able
to trace the cause of this problem. However, the existence of the
problem has been verified by Microsoft.
<P>
The Intel products included here are manufactured by vendors
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise,
regarding these products' performance or reliability.
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT and Windows
NT Advanced Server version 3.1. We are researching this problem and
will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT and Windows NT
Advanced Server version 3.1. This problem was corrected in the latest U.S.
Service Pack for Windows NT and Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1. For
information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):
