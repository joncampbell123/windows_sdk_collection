A terminator is a set of resistors placed at each end of a
transmission line, such as the SCSI (small systems computer interface)
bus. Terminators help to prevent signal reflections at the ends of the
transmission line and ensures that the signal on the line quickly
reaches its desired state. A correctly terminated SCSI bus supports
faster and more reliable operation. Each end of the physical SCSI bus
should have one SCSI terminator attached.
<P>
Physically, there are two types of terminators: internal and external.
There are no electrical differences between these two terminator
types. An external terminator looks like a SCSI bus connector without
any cable attached to it. An internal terminator usually consists of
two or three resistor SIPs (single in-line packages). On some new SCSI
devices, the internal terminator is controlled by a switch or jumper
on the device. For more information on internal termination in such
devices, please refer to the device documentation.
<P>
<PRE>   CAUTION: Some external devices, such as SCSI disks, have internal
   terminators installed. The only method to detect these terminators
   involves opening the cabinet and inspecting the device. Remove
   internal terminators from external devices.

</PRE>Electrically, there are two types of terminators: passive and active.
Passive terminators were defined in the SCSI-I standard and are in
widespread use today. A passive terminator is just a set of resisters.
If you do not know what type terminator your device uses and it is not
marked, it most likely uses a passive terminator. An active terminator
includes active components, such as transistors, along with resistors.
Active terminators were defined in the SCSI-II standard and are fairly
new. Active terminators provide better termination response and
support faster, more reliable bus operation. Some of the newer and
faster controllers should have active terminators. The Adaptec
aha154xC drive requires active terminators. Installing active
terminators is a simple hardware modification that solves many SCSI
bus problems.
<P>
To work properly, terminators require power from the SCSI bus. This
power is referred to as Term Power. It is typically supplied by the
host adapter and by the other devices on the SCSI bus. Ideally, Term
Power should be supplied by the last device on each end of the SCSI
bus. In any case, at least one device on the bus must supply Term
Power. In most configurations, Term Power is not a problem. However,
some of the older FD8xx adapters do not supply Term Power; these
adapters were usually included with SCSI devices that supply Term
Power. Term Power is normally controlled by a jumper or switch on the
SCSI device. For more information on enabling Term Power, please refer
to your hardware documentation. To ensure that Term Power is properly
supplied, all devices connected to the SCSI bus should be powered on
whenever the bus is in use.
<P>
The quality of the SCSI cables also affects the reliability and
usability of a SCSI system. The SCSI-II standard defines the
characteristics of good cables. They are 100% shielded round cables
that contain 25 twisted pairs of wires. Each pair should have a
characteristic impedance between 90 and 110 ohms. The wire gauge
should be 26 or 28. Most SCSI cables do not meet these requirements.
Adaptec recommends always using good SCSI cables with the aha154xC
disk drive. If you connect more than three devices to a SCSI bus, it
is a good idea to always use high quality SCSI cables.
<P>
Some SCSI configurations work in MS-DOS but do not work in Windows NT
because Windows NT uses SCSI more aggressively. Typically, Windows NT
transfers larger data blocks and uses faster data transfer modes than
MS-DOS does. Also, because Windows NT supports more devices on a SCSI
bus, termination issues become more important.
