The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
You are unable to complete Windows NT version 3.5 Setup. Setup fails and
the following error messages appear:
<P>
<PRE>   Noncritical Error
   An error has occurred.

   External library procedure SetMyComputerName reported
   the following error: Unable to set the local computer name.

   You may continue (ignoring the error), retry the operation, or exit
   Setup. If you choose to ignore the error, Setup may not be able to
   completely and/or correctly install the software. If you exit, you will
   have to repeat the Setup process from the beginning.

   Ignore     Retry     Exit Setup

</PRE>If you choose Retry, your system beeps. If you choose Ignore, the following
STOP message appears:
<P>
<PRE>   STOP: Setup couldn't modify your computer name.
   Cannot proceed with Install.

</PRE>After you choose the OK button, the following error message appears:
<P>
<PRE>   Windows NT 3.5 has not been installed.

   Remove disks from the floppy disk drives and choose Restart Computer to
   restart your computer."

</PRE>If you attempt to run Windows NT after you restart the computer, the
following error message appears:
<P>
<PRE>   The system is not fully installed. Please setup again.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When Setup prompts you for a computer name, you are allowed to create an
invalid computer name by entering braces ("{}") as the first two characters
of the computer name.
<P>
The following characters are usually invalid for use in a computer name:
<P>
<PRE>   /\[]":;|&lt;&gt;+=,?*

</PRE>Due to the way the .INF files in Setup process the computer name, a
computer name that begins with braces always passes the validation tests;
however, the invalid computer name eventually causes Setup to fail when
Setup attempts to register the computer name.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To avoid this problem, do not use braces at the beginning of a computer
name.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. We
are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
