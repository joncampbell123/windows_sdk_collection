<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article discusses the extensive study in determining the causes of
some NMI Memory Parity Errors in Windows NT with the aid of a high tech
SIMM tester. The results are not conclusive and the research into this is
ongoing.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Both IBM OS/2 2.x and Window NT seem to experience problems which appear to
be associated with system memory in some circumstances. It can be
frustrating to have a system that is able to run DOS, Windows 3.1 or OS/2
1.x and suddenly find it cannot run Windows NT due to this problem. The
first issue to clear up is that not all NMI errors are due to memory. Other
boards in the system can cause this problem and components directly on the
system motherboard can be at fault.
<P>
When memory is at fault, it is usually for the following reasons:

<OL><P><LI>The memory is not functioning at the specified access rate as
   required by the system board. If the system specification calls for
   80 ns access rate, Windows NT most likely fails if memory is
   accessing at a slower rate such as 90 ns. Even though the chips may
   be marked as 80 ns, in testing, some fail to meet this access rate.
   Quite often memory chips run at a slower speed when they reach
   operating temperature. This produces an effect called "speed
   drift." The symptoms are a system which runs Windows NT when first
   turned on; however, after 15 minutes or so, the system starts having
   memory errors. A high quality SIMM tester can cycle the chips
   through various voltage and heat cycles, so this is fairly easy to
   see.

<P><LI>The memory meets the system specifications, but the speeds are
   different between individual SIMM modules. The average access rate
   may be 70 ns on one SIMM module while the next is running at 60 ns.
   We have found SIMMs stamped at the factory to be rated at a 70 ns
   average access rate to actually be running as fast as 50 ns.
   Although the SIMMs are obviously well under the system required
   access specification, the difference of 10 ns or more between them
   can often cause problems on some systems. An interesting note here
   is that you can move these to a different system board which is
   using a different BIOS and chip set, and it may not have any memory
   problems. This is because each BIOS and chip set regulate the
   "refresh wait states" used for timing, and this difference often
   allows for variance in speed to be acceptable. If your system's
   BIOS allows you to adjust the "wait states" for memory refresh,
   this often will allow the system to run with SIMMs or DRAM memory
   chips which are running at different access rates. The downside to
   increasing the number of wait states is a slower system.

<P><LI>The individual chips on the SIMM module are running at different
   access rates. This requires a sensitive memory testing device to
   determine. It must be able to gauge the access rate of each
   individual bit (chip) on the module. A difference of 10 ns or more
   between bits has been known to cause problems. This once again can
   be regulated somewhat by the BIOS and chip set of the system board
   if it allows you to lengthen the refresh wait states for memory
   access.

<P><LI>One of the memory chips is being affected by "cell leakage." This
   ends up being a true parity error and is also known as a "soft
   error." This occurs when the change in the state of an individual
   cell (a zero or one) electrically leaks into a neighboring cell
   changing it's state. When the memory is read back, it no longer
   matches the parity bit's checksum value and an NMI is issued to the
   processor signaling a parity error has occurred. This memory SIMM
   must be replaced. If problems persist with replacement chips, there
   is quite possibly a voltage or heat anomaly occurring with the
   socket or circuitry which is damaging the chips.

<P><LI>Cache memory is another thing to suspect. We have seen instances
   where the Cache memory access rates were too slow and caused
   enormous problems. On most Intel-based 486 computers, a 15 ns to
   25 ns is normal. You will most likely have problems if it is slower
   than 25 ns. The system manufacturer can provide the specifications
   and locations of these chips.
<P>
</OL>In general, you should first carefully clean the system of dust. This
includes the areas allowing ventilation so that heat does not build up
abnormally. The contacts of all boards and SIMMs should be cleaned. You can
use the eraser of a pencil to do this, thus ensuring good contacts. Be
certain that all boards are firmly seated in their slots or sockets. It may
be necessary to replace old cabling which may degrade over time and under
high temperatures. Power supplies can also cause many problems, thus, if
possible, have the output voltages checked. Monitors can cause strange
behaviors on your system as well. It is also highly recommended that
computers be placed on some type of Surge Suppression power strip since
after a power outage occurs, the return of power back on is usually a
fairly high surge and can permanently damage sensitive electrical
components of your system.
