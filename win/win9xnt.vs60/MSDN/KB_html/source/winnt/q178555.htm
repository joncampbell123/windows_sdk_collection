The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it
if a problem occurs. For information on how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" online Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry
Key" online Help topic in Regedt32.exe.
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how a Windows NT Administrator can move scheduled
jobs from one Windows NT 4.0 server to another. For example, a server with
several different batch jobs scheduled to run at various times throughout
the week needs to be taken offline, so the jobs need to be moved to another
server.
<P>
NOTE: The purpose of this article is to instruct you how to move the
schedule from one server to another. All batch files, applications, or
services called upon by these scheduled jobs still have to be installed
locally on the computer you are moving the scheduled jobs to.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Follow the steps below to move all scheduled jobs from Server1 to
Server2:
<P>
<P><h3>Server1</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then
   double-click Services.

<P><LI>Stop the Schedule service.
<P>
   WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems
   that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft
   cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of
   Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
   For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys
   And Values" online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the
   "Add and Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data"
   online Help topics in Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the
   registry before you edit it.

<P><LI>Run Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe) and go to the following subkey:
<P>
<P><PRE>      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Schedule
</PRE>
<P><LI>On the Registry menu, click Save Key.

<P><LI>Navigate to a network share accessible by both servers, then name the
   file Schedule.reg.
<P>
</OL><h3>Server2</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then      NOTE:
   double-click Services.

<P><LI>Stop the Schedule service, if it is running.

<P><LI>Run Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe) and go to the following subkey:
<P>
<P><PRE>      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Schedule
</PRE>
<P><LI>On the Registry menu, click Restore, select the saved file on the
   network share mentioned in Step 5 under Server1, and then click Open.
<P>
   You will be prompted with a warning that Registry Editor will
   restore a key on top of the currently selected Key. If there were jobs
   previously scheduled on Server 2, they will be replaced.
<P>
   Click OK to continue.

<P><LI>Close Registry Editor.

<P><LI>Click Start, point to Setting, click Control Panel, and then
   double-click Services.

<P><LI>Start the Schedule service.
<P>
</OL>The entire job schedule is now transferred to the new server without
having to manually recreate them using the AT command or WinAT.
