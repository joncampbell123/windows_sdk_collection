The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0
   - Microsoft Cluster Server
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Cluster Server (MSCS) maintains details about changes within the
cluster via a quorum log file. If this file becomes corrupted for any
reason, it is possible that the cluster service may not start.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The quorum log contains recovery information for the cluster and
information about changes to the cluster configuration. When the cluster
service starts, it reads the quorum log file. The service can handle some
error conditions regarding this file and may elect to discard the file and
create a new one. In this case, MSCS writes the following message in the
Windows NT system event log:
<P>
<PRE>   The log file D:\MSCS\quolog.log was found to be corrupt. An attempt will
   be made to reset it, or you should use the Cluster Administrator utility
   to adjust the maximum size.

</PRE>If the log file becomes corrupted and cannot be reset, the cluster service
may not start. To correct this problem, you must use the "noquorumlogging"
option when starting the Cluster service. This option allows the cluster to
start without quorum logging. You may then access the quorum disk and
remove the corrupted Quolog.log file.
<P>
Use the following procedure to help recover from this situation:

<OL><P><LI>If the Cluster service is running, use Control Panel on both nodes to
   stop the Cluster service.

<P><LI>On one node, use the Services tool in Control Panel to specify
   "-noquorumlogging" as the startup parameter for the Cluster service and
   start the service.

<P><LI>On the quorum disk, run Chkdsk. If the disk does not show corruption,
   the log file may be corrupted. In this case, delete the Quolog.log file
   and any .tmp files located in the MSCS folder on the quorum disk.

<P><LI>In Services, stop the Cluster service, and then start the Cluster
   service without startup parameters. After the service starts, you may
   start the service on the other node.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: When you disable quorum logging within a cluster, changes to the
cluster configuration cannot be logged. If a node goes offline during this
period, recent changes may be lost if changes could not be communicated to
the other node. Quorum logging should only be disabled when necessary to
recover from log file corruption.
