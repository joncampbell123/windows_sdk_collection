<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article provides information on the different types of Digiboard
adapters, on contacting Digiboard, and on the currently supported Digiboard
adapters under Windows NT. The following section, Digiboard Adapter Support
covers the different types of Digiboard adapters and the Microsoft product
support boundaries for Digiboard problems. The next section, Digiboard
Contact Information, covers all the ways you can obtain help or files from
Digiboard. The last section, List of Supported Digiboard Adapters, covers
the current list of adapters that Windows NT supports. Note: Some of the
supported adapters require drivers from Digiboard; check the following
section to see which do.
<P>
<P><h2>DIGIBOARD ADAPTER SUPPORT</h2>
 
<P>
Digiboard manufactures two general classes of serial adapters: intelligent
and non-intelligent. These products are installed and supported in two
different ways under Windows NT.
<P>
<P><h3>Digiboard Non-Intelligent Serial Products</h3>
 
<P>
Products:
<P>
<PRE>   PC/X
   MC/X
   MODEM/X

</PRE>Installation:
<P>
Support for the non-intelligent Digiboard is provided by the native Windows
NT serial device driver. These adapters are treated as any other standard
serial adapter.
<P>
Non-intelligent boards are configured by hand-editing values in the
Registry. This is necessary to create some special entries required for the
Digiboard adapter. Information on this procedure is available in section
19.0 of the README.WRI file located in SYSTEM32 sub-directory.
<P>
Primary Support:
<P>
Primary engineering support for this device driver is provided by
Microsoft. Microsoft will assist you in editing the Registry and using the
device with Windows NT applications. If you suspect your adapter is not
configured correctly or is malfunctioning contact Digiboard.
<P>
<P><h3>Digiboard Intelligent Serial Products</h3>
 
<P>
Products:
<P>
<PRE>   PC/Xe
   PC/Xi
   PC/Xem
   C/X
   2Port
   4Port
   8Port
   MC/Xi
   MC/Xem*
   C/X MCA
   2Port MCA

</PRE>*Version 1.1.4.6 or later of the MC/Xem driver for MCA computers is
required for full support of this adapter under Windows NT.
<P>
Installation:
<P>
The Intelligent Digiboard adapters listed above require a custom device
driver. Custom drivers are independently developed by Digiboard and are
distributed by Microsoft with Windows NT. If you use any of the adapters
above, contact Digiboard for driver updates.
<P>
You can install the Digiboard drivers from Control Panel in the Networks
section. The supported Digiboard adapters are listed in the Add Adapter
dialog box.
<P>
Primary Support:
<P>
Digiboard provides primary support for their custom device drivers.
Similarly, for a malfunctioning adapter, contact Digiboard. Microsoft will
provide support for network configuration issues such as setting up Remote
Access Services.
