The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you try to log on to your Microsoft Windows NT computer, you may
experience one of the following:

<UL><LI>With Microsoft Windows NT version 3.5:
<P>
   You see the initial background screen that is shown during logon, but
   you never see Program Manager and no messages are displayed.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>With Microsoft Windows NT version 3.51:
<P>
   You see the Shutdown in Progress dialog box, then Microsoft Windows NT
   shuts down and displays the Shutdown Complete and Restart buttons.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>With Microsoft Windows NT version 4.0:
<P>
   After typing your user information, you are returned to the "Press
   Ctrl-Alt-Del to log on" dialog box.
<P>
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The user account does not have permissions to the %SystemRoot%\System32
directory of the local computer. Normally, the Everyone group is given
Change permissions (Read, Write, Execute, Delete) to this directory. If
these permissions are denied, the user cannot access the system, even if
the user attempts to log on as an administrator of a domain.
<P>
If you do not have the necessary permissions to the local computer, you
should get a dialog box that informs you of this. When you click OK, you
should get the logon screen. The Shutdown sequence should not be started.
<P>
This also happens on DEC Alpha computers that have the System files on a
file allocation table (FAT) partition. This is because of the "Secure the
System Partition" option in Disk Administrator.
<P>
By default, this is turned off. If it is on, no users except for users in
the Administrator group can logon.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To correct this problem, apply specific permission for the individual user
on the %Systemroot%\System32 directory, or give the Everyone group a
minimum of Change permission for this directory. To change specific
permissions, install another copy of Microsoft Windows NT to a new
directory. Log on as the same user with the same user privileges and change
the permissions for the original System32 directory.
<P>
To work around this problem in Microsoft Windows NT version 3.51, apply the
fix mentioned below. Windows NT 4.0 already has this fix included and is
responding properly.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows NT
version 3.51. This problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51 U.S.
Service Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
