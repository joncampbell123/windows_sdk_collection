The information in this article applies to:

<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5 and 3.51
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Macintosh clients' refresh rate may create a bottleneck in the Windows NT
server. The Macintosh client issues a "GetVolParms," which is designed to
refresh the directory of a mounted volume for file updates on any Macintosh
running System 7.x or higher.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When a Macintosh client mounts a Windows NT Server Macintosh volume, the
client will send a "GetVolParms" to the server every 10 seconds for the
first 10 volumes mounted. When you have a large number of Macintosh clients
connected to multiple Windows NT volumes, the Macintosh clients will create
a bottleneck in the server's bandwidth for the network card resources.
<P>
Apple Computer has configured this refresh rate to adjust itself according
to the number of volumes. If the number of volumes mounted is greater than
10, the "GetVolParms" adjusts itself so that the number of volumes equals
the number of seconds for refresh rate. For example, if you have a
Macintosh with 20 volumes connected, then the refresh rate will be 20
seconds for each of the volumes. If you have two hundred clients and each
client has two volumes mounted, there will be four hundred (200x2) requests
every ten seconds for a total of 2400 requests per minute.
<P>
The "GetVolParms" is a looping structure that will continue until the
volume is disconnected. As soon as the "GetVolParms" is issued the
internal counter will reset and wait ten seconds, depending on number of
volumes mounted, and regardless of when the reply returns to the Macintosh
client. If the "Current Queue Length" is busy and Windows NT Server takes
five seconds to respond, the next request will occur in five seconds.
<P>
For individuals who wish to optimize their Macintosh Clients, third party
products like Less Talk will allow the user or the administrator to
configure and control the polling interval for each mounted volume.
