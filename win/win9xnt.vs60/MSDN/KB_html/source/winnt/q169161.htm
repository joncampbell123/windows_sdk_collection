The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51 and 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The following registry parameters can be modified to change the behavior
of Routing Information Protocol (RIP) for Internet Protocol (IP) included
in Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 and Microsoft Windows NT Server
version 3.51 Service Pack 2 and above.
<P>
NOTE: These parameters are not valid for the version of RIP included in
the Routing and Remote Access Service Update. The Routing and Remote
Access Service Update is available for download from www.microsoft.com and
ftp.microsoft.com.
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them.
Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of
Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.
<P>
To make changes using Registry Editor:

<OL><P><LI>Start the Registry Editor by running the Regedt32.exe.

</OL></UL><LI>or -
<P>
   At the command prompt, type Regedt32, and then press ENTER. When the
   Registry Editor window appears, you can press F1 to get Help on how to
   make changes in Registry Editor.

</UL><OL><P><LI>In Registry Editor, click the window titled HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE On Local
   Machine, and then click the icons for the SYSTEM subtree until you
   reach the appropriate subkey, as described later in this section.
<P>
</OL>The Registry parameters for IP RIP are specified under the following key:
<P>
<PRE>   SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\IpRip\Parameters

</PRE></OL>AcceptDefaultRoutes
Data type = REG_DWORD
Range = 0 or 1
Default = 0
If set to 1, default routes in received RIP announcements are accepted. By
default, they are ignored.
<P>
AcceptHostRoutes
Data type = REG_DWORD
Range = 0 or 1
Default = 0
If set to 1, host routes in received RIP announcements are accepted. By
default, they are ignored.
<P>
AnnounceDefaultRoutes
Data type = REG_DWORD
Range = 0 or 1
Default = 0
If set to 1, default routes are included in RIP announcements.
<P>
AnnounceHostRoutes
Data type = REG_DWORD
Range = 0 or 1
Default = 0
If set to 1, host routes are included in RIP announcements.
<P>
EnablePoisonedReverse
Data type = REG_DWORD
Range = 0 or 1
Default = 1
By default, if a RIP announcement contains a route that was previously
advertised by that route, then that route is announced on the network with
a metric of 16.
<P>
EnableSplitHorizon
Data type = REG_DWORD
Range = 0 or 1
Default = 1
By default, routes learned on a network are suppressed in updates sent on
that network. If the parameter is set to 0, routes learned on a network
are
announced on the same network, as well.
<P>
EnableTriggeredUpdates
Data type = REG_DWORD
Range = 0 or 1
Default = 1
By default, new routes and metric changes trigger an immediate update that
includes only the changes. The time between updates depends on the value
of MaxTriggeredUpdateFrequency.
<P>
GarbageTimeout
Data type = REG_DWORD
Range = 15 seconds - 259200 seconds (72 hours)
Default = 120 seconds
The number of seconds to wait before removing a route marked for garbage
collection.
<P>
LoggingLevel
Data type = REG_DWORD
Range = 0 - 3
Default = 1
The minimum level of information for entries being made to the system log;
0 = no logging, 1 = errors, 2 = warnings, 3 = information.
<P>
MaxTriggeredUpdateFrequency
Data type = REG_DWORD
Range = 1 second - 884400 seconds (24 hours)
Default = 5 seconds
The minimum number of seconds that must elapse between triggered updates.
<P>
RouteTimeout
Data type = REG_DWORD
Range = 15 seconds - 259200 seconds (72 hours)
Default = 180 seconds
The number of seconds to wait before marking a route for garbage
collection.
<P>
SilentRip
Data type = REG_DWORD
Range = 0 or 1
Default = 0
If set to 1, suppresses periodic RIP announcements.
<P>
UpdateFrequency
Data type = REG_DWORD
Range = 15 seconds - 884400 seconds (24 hours)
Default = 30 seconds
The number of seconds between periodic updates that contain the entire
routing table. This entry also determines the period at which the route
table is updated from received RIP updates.
