The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51 and 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51 and 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Netlogon creates many errors that are recorded in the event log, which
eventually fills or wraps the log.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Netlogon.chg file is located on all domain controllers, but is used
only by the primary domain controlloer (PDC) to keep track of changes made
to the security databases. All changes to the security databases are
recorded in this log file, along with the serial number of the change. Each
of the three security databases maintains a separate serial number, which
is incremented once for each change. When a backup domain controller (BDC)
requests a particular change from the PDC, the PDC checks the change log to
determine which changes need to be sent.
<P>
<P><h3>Specific Events and Errors</h3>
 
<P>
The following events may be recorded on the BDC:
<P>
<PRE>   Event ID: 5717
   Source: NETLOGON
   Type: Information
   The full synchronization replication of the LSA database from the
   primary domain controller \\&lt;DOMAIN CONTROLLER&gt; completed successfully.

   Event ID: 5716
   Source: NETLOGON
   Type: Warning
   The partial synchronization replication of the SAM database from the
   primary domain controller &lt;DOMAIN CONTROLLER&gt; failed with the following
   error:

      &lt;THERE IS NO ERROR REPORTED&gt;

   The Data section contains c0000134 (Words) or 34 01 00 c0 (Bytes.); the
   c0000134 indicates STATUS_SYNCHRONIZATION_REQUIRED.

</PRE>The following events may be reported on the PDC:
<P>
<PRE>   Event ID: 5713
   Source: NETLOGON
   Type: Information
   The full synchronization request from the server &lt;SERVERNAME&gt; completed
   successfully. &lt;X&gt; object(s) has(have) been returned to the caller.

   Event ID: 5712
   Source: NETLOGON
   Type: Warning
   The partial synchronization request from the server &lt;SERVERNAME&gt; failed
   with the following error:

      &lt;THERE IS NO ERROR REPORTED&gt;

</PRE>Trying to promote a BDC to a PDC may cause the following pop-up window
message to stay on the screen indefinitely:
<P>
<PRE>   "Synchronizing &lt;BDC&gt; with its primary"

</PRE>The following event log error may be generated:
<P>
<PRE>   Event ID: 5705
   Source: NETLOGON
   Type: Error
   The change log cache maintained by the Netlogon Service for database
   changes is corrupted. The Netlogon service is resetting the change log.

</PRE>These events can be caused when Windows NT fails to update the
%SystemRoot%\Netlogon.chg file on the PDC. This may occur for any of the
following reasons:

<UL><LI> The Read-Only attribute could be set.

<LI>The netlogon.chg file could be corrupted.

<LI>The permissions for the system account could be insufficient for that
   file; they should be at least RWXD.
<P>
</UL><h3>Resolving the Problem</h3>
 
<P>
If the Netlogon.chg file has been corrupted, it may be necessary to delete
or rename the file. However, this file is always in use by the system.
<P>
To delete (reset) Netlogon.chg on an NTFS partition, use the following
steps:

<OL><P><LI>Set the permissions so that the %SystemRoot%\Netlogon.chg file has No
  Access for the System account.

<P><LI>Restart the system and delete the file when it comes up

<P><LI>Restart again. The file will be recreated at startup.
<P>
</OL>To delete (reset) Netlogon.chg on a FAT partition, use the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Start the system using MS-DOS, and then delete the
   %SystemRoot%\Netlogon.chg file.

<P><LI>Restart using Windows NT. The file will be recreated at startup.
