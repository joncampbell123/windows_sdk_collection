The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
</UL>

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When Windows NT is installed on a system that has a SCSI drive as
drive C, it copies the appropriate SCSI driver to the root of drive C
as a file called NTBOOTDD.SYS. If the host adapter is changed to a
different adapter model or brand, Windows NT will not start (boot) and
you will receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Windows NT could not start because of a computer disk hardware
   configuration problem.

   Could not read from the selected boot disk. Check boot path
   and boot hardware.

   Please check the Windows NT documentation about hardware
   disk configuration and your hardware reference manuals for
   additional information.

   Boot failed.

</PRE>The reason for the boot failure is that the incorrect SCSI driver is
being loaded. This can be resolved by copying the appropriate driver
to the root directory of drive C and renaming it "NTBOOTDD.SYS" prior
to installing the new adapter.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When Windows NT is installed onto a system that has a SCSI drive as
drive C, it copies the appropriate SCSI driver to the root of drive C
as a file called NTBOOTDD.SYS. This file has SHR attributes. If the
SCSI controller is changed to a different type or brand, the
NTBOOTDD.SYS file will not be the correct driver for the new
controller. To change controller types, you must install the SCSI
adapter through Windows NT Setup, and copy the appropriate driver to
the root of drive C as NTBOOTDD.SYS. A detailed explanation follows:
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
For the purpose of explanation, assume that Windows NT is initially
installed on a system where the drive C is connected to an Adaptec
1542c. Now attempt to change the 1542c to an Adaptec 1742a controller.
To do this, do the following BEFORE physically installing the new
adapter:

<OL><P><LI>From the Main group in Program Manager, run Windows NT Setup.

<P><LI>From the Options menu in Windows NT Setup, choose Add/Remove SCSI
    Adapters.

<P><LI>Choose the Add button.

<P><LI>Read the Setup message, and then choose the OK button.

<P><LI>Select the Adaptec 174x adapter.

<P><LI>Enter the appropriate path for the installation media, and then
    choose the Continue button.
<P>
    Windows NT Setup will install the selected driver.
<P>
    You will now see a list of the SCSI adapters installed on your
    system. You should see both the Adaptec 154x and 174x SCSI
    adapters.

<P><LI>Highlight the Adaptec 1542c and choose the Remove button. Read
    the Setup message, and then choose the OK button.
<P>
    The Installed Adapter list will again be displayed. Choose the Close
    button and quit Windows NT Setup.

<P><LI>Open File Manager and allow viewing of Hidden/System Files. Do
    this choosing By File Type from the View menu and then select the
    Show Hidden/System Files check box.

<P><LI>In the root directory, highlight the hidden file NTBOOTDD.SYS.

<P><LI>Rename the file to NTBOOTDD.OLD.

<P><LI>Copy the appropriate driver from the &lt;systemroot&gt;\SYSTEM32\DRIVERS
    directory. In the example, the file for the Adaptec 1742 is
    AHA174X.SYS. Copy this file to the root of drive C.

<P><LI>Rename the file just copied to the root directory (in the example
    it is the file AHA174x.SYS) to NTBOOTDD.SYS and place the Hidden,
    System, and Read Only attributes to the file.

<P><LI>Quit all applications and shut the system down.
<P>
</OL>You can now replace the Adaptec 1542c adapter with the Adaptec 1742a
adapter. When you reboot Windows NT, the appropriate drivers will be
in place to let you use the 1742a adapter as the controller for drive
C.
