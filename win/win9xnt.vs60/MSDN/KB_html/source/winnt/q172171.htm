The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51 and 4.0
</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
An Administrator may wish to create Macintosh volumes in which Macintosh
clients only have the Write permission. This proposes a problem because the
Macintosh clients must be able to see the folder in order to write to it.
Therefore, a volume cannot be created where the Everyone group only has the
Make Changes permission. The volume must also have the See Folders
permission. To accomplish this task, you can create a volume that Macintosh
users can see, then create a folder in that volume that users can drag and
drop files into without ever being able to see the contents of the folder.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To create folders in which Macintosh clients only have the Write
Permission, follow these steps on the Windows NT Server with Services for
Macintosh installed:

<OL><P><LI>Create a default Macintosh Volume using the MacFile menu in
   File Manager (Winfile.exe). For example, create a directory called
   C:\MacFolder.
<P>
   If the Volume is already created, proceed to Step #2.

<P><LI>From the Macfile Menu, click Permissions. Check the following boxes for
   the Everyone group:
<P>
<P><PRE>      X  See Folders
      X  See Files
      X  Make Changes
</PRE>
<P><LI>Create a subdirectory in the Macintosh Volume. For example,
   C:\MacFolder\Files. Select this new Files folder.

<P><LI>From the MacFile menu, click Permissions. Check the following box for
   the Everyone group:
<P>
<P><PRE>      X  Make Changes
</PRE><P>
</OL>When Macintosh clients log into this Windows NT Server, they are able to
select the Macintosh volume with See Files and See Folders permission.
After they have selected this volume, the folder will appear on their
desktop. When they double-click on the folder (volume), the subdirectory
Files will appear as a normal folder but it will have a Belt around it.
This prevents users from being able to open the folder and viewing its
contents, but will still be able to drag and drop files into that folder.
