<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The information in this article provides a way to build a trust
relationship between two domains from a command line. To do this, use the
NETDOM command line utility that comes with the Windows NT 4.0 Resource Kit
Supplement 2.
<P>
CAUTION: The method described in this article has not been extensively
tested in large installations. Microsoft cannot guarantee that modification
of domains as recommended herein will accomplish the objective described in
this article under all circumstances and in all configurations.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Suppose MYMASTERDOM is the name of the master domain (that is, the trusted
domain) and MYRESOURCEDOM the name of the resource domain (the trusting
domain) that will trust the master domain.
<P>
With NETDOM, you can build the trust relationship from the command line. To
do this, perform the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the master domain, use the following command to create a resource
   computer account (note that this command should appear on a single
   line):
<P>
<P><PRE>      NETDOM /Domain:MYMASTERDOM RESOURCE MYRESOURCEDOM
      &lt;trust password&gt; /ADD
</PRE>
<P><LI>On the resource domain, use the following command to establish a trust
   with the master domain (note that this command should appear on a single
   line):
<P>
<P><PRE>      NETDOM /Domain:MYRESOURCEDOM MASTER MYMASTERDOM
      &lt;trust password&gt; /TRUST
</PRE><P>
</OL>NETDOM can also build a trust relationship and complete the operations
above all at once. If you have an administrator access to the resource
domain, the either of the following commands builds the trust relationship
in one step (note that these commands should each appear on a single line):
<P>
<PRE>   NETDOM MASTER MYMASTERDOM &lt;trust password&gt; /TRUST

   -or-

   (If you need to enter an administrator account for the resource domain)

   NETDOM /Domain:MYRESOURCEDOM /User:MYRESOURCEDOM\&lt;administrator user&gt;
   /Password:&lt;administrator password&gt; MASTER MYMASTERDOM &lt;trust password&gt;
   /TRUST

</PRE></OL>You can run the second command above from the master domain primary domain
controller (PDC) or from any Windows NT computer as soon as you have an
administrator access to the master domain.
<P>
For more information on the NETDOM command, refer to the Windows NT 4.0
Resource Kit documentation.
