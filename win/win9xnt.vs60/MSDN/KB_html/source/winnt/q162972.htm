The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.1, 3.5, 3.51, 4.0

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Backup program included with Windows NT (Ntbackup.exe) is a basic tape
backup program. It can back up mapped network drives, local drives, and
the registry. Backups can span multiple tapes. Backup does not support
backing up to removable media other than tape.
<P>
This article describes how to troubleshoot problems with Backup.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Tape Drive Is Not Recognized</h3>
 
<P>
The most common reason for this is a problem with the SCSI bus. Verify
that the cables are properly attached to the tape drive and that the SCSI
bus is correctly terminated.
<P>
<P><h3>Error Writing to Tape</h3>
 
<P>
This may be due to a problem with the SCSI bus or a bad tape. When you
reuse tapes, be sure to erase them first. Format and retension the tape
before reuse if you can.
<P>
<P><h3>Invalid Media</h3>
 
<P>
Check to be certain you have inserted the correct type of tape for your
tape device. This may also be an indication that the tape is bad and needs
to be replaced.
<P>
<P><h3>Skipped Files</h3>
 
<P>
Backup cannot back up files that are locked open by another process. If
the file does not become available in 30 seconds, the file is skipped.
<P>
Close as many running programs as you can before you perform a backup.
There are some third-party backup programs that allow you to back up open
files.
<P>

   TITLE     : Files Skipped with Windows NT Backup

</PRE><h3>Fatal Error on Drive 1</h3>
 
<P>
This is usually caused by either incompatible hardware or out-of-date
firmware on the tape device or controller. Consult the Hardware
Compatibility List to make sure your hardware is supported, then check
with the manufacturer to see if there is a firmware update available.

</PRE><h3>Fatal Translation Error on Tape in Drive 1</h3>
 
<P>
This error can be caused by firmware or incorrect SCSI termination. Verify
that the SCSI bus is correctly terminated. Contact the manufacturer of
your tape device for an updated firmware revision.

This is a SCSI bus issue resulting from improperly set SCSI ID numbers,
faulty termination, or cable issues. Consult the SCSI Troubleshooter for
help diagnosing problems with the SCSI bus.

</PRE>Tape Drive Has Been Detected But the Driver Has Failed to Load or Is Not
Started -or- Error 0020: Could Not Find Device Specified
 
<P>
The tape device is not configured correctly for use with Windows NT
Backup. Consult the tape device manual or contact the manufacturer for
correct settings.
<P>
For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

</PRE>Tape Drive Error Detected: A Tape Device Has Been Detected, and the Tape
Driver Started. However, the Tape Device Is Not Responding. Check That
Tape Device Power Is On and Cables Are Properly Connected.
 
<P>
This may be caused by incorrect firmware versions, or by incorrect CMOS
settings. Check your computer's CMOS settings to verify that SCSI
Disconnect is enabled. Contact the manufacturer for an updated firmware
revision if necessary.

               Adapter

</PRE><h3>STOP: 0x0000000A IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL</h3>
 
<P>
This can occur on a multiple-processor computer using fault-tolerant NTFS
drives. There is a fix for this issue included in Service Pack 2 for
Windows NT version 3.51.
<P>
For additional information, please see the following article in the

   TITLE     : STOP 0x0000000A May Occur on Multi-processor Computers

</PRE><h3>This Set Is Compressed and Cannot Be Viewed or Restored</h3>
 
<P>
The backup set was created in a backup program that supports compression.
Windows NT Backup does not support software compression for backup sets.
<P>
For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../winnt/q138116.htm">Q138116</A></B>
   TITLE     : NTBACKUP Cannot Catalog and Restore Compressed Data from
               Tape

</PRE><h3>The Backup Set Is Not Completely Cataloged</h3>
 
<P>
This occurs when the catalog file on the hard disk contains incomplete
information. Quitting and restarting Backup may resolve the issue. If not,
locate the catalog file on the hard disk and either rename it or delete
it, and then re-catalog the tape.
<P>

</PRE>You Do Not Have Permission to Access Portions of Data. Please See the
Owner or Administrator to Get Permission.
 
<P>
This indicates that you do not have appropriate permissions for the
folder you are attempting to back up or to which you are restoring files.

   TITLE     : NT/RDR: "Access Denied" with Windows NT 4.0 Ntbackup

</PRE>Catalog Information: Unable to Load Catalog Data from Tape -or- Catalog
Error: Error Writing a Catalog File, Check Available Space
 
<P>
These error messages can be generated by trying to restore to a full hard
disk. The catalog files are stored in a compressed format and need to be
expanded on the hard disk at the beginning of the restore operation. You
can resolve these errors by either freeing disk space on the target drive,
or by replacing the hard disk with a larger drive.

</PRE><h3>Foreign Tape: The Tape In the Drive Must Be Erased Before It Can Be Used</h3>
 
<P>
This occurs with a backup set from another backup program, or one that was
created in Microsoft Windows 95.
<P>

Tape Driver Has Either Not Been Installed, or Failed to Start. Make Sure
That the Appropriate Driver Has Been Installed Using the Tape Devices
Option in Control Panel.
 
<P>
Windows NT cannot install tape device drivers during Setup. After Setup is
finished, double-click Tape Devices in Control Panel. If your tape device
is not listed, click Detect. Click OK when you are prompted to install the
drivers for the tape device.
