The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51. and 4.0
</UL> 
IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Windows NT ends daylight savings time in the Brisbane, Melbourne, Sydney
and Adeliade time zones on the first Sunday in March. The time zones do not
actually officially switch back to standard time until the last Sunday of
March.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The date that Windows NT ends daylight savings time is set incorrectly in
the system registry.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, do one of the following:

<UL><LI>The Windows NT 4.0 Resource Kit includes a TZEDIT program. Use this
   program to change the affected time zones to end daylight savings time
   on the last Sunday in March.

<LI>If the Resource Kit is unavailable, make the following changes in the
   system registry.
<P>
   WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems
   that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft
   cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of
   Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
   For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys
   And Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and
   Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics
   in Regedt32.exe. Not that you should back up the registry before you
   edit it.
<P>
   1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).
<P>
   2. In the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, find the subkey for the Adelaide
<P><PRE>      time zone:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>         SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Time Zones\Cen.
         Australia Standard Time

         NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for
         readability.

   3. Open the value TZI in your time zone key to get into the binary
      editor.

   4. You should see binary information like this:

      C6FDFFFF00000000C4FFFFFF0000030000000100020000000000000000000
      A00000005000200000000000000

      NOTE: The above binary information is one line; it has been wrapped
      for readability.

   5. Change this value to the following value:

      C6FDFFFF00000000C4FFFFFF0000030000000500020000000000000000000
      A00000005000200000000000000

      NOTE: The above binary information is one line; it has been wrapped
      for readability.

   6. In the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree find the subkey for the Brisbane,
      Melbourne, Sydney time zone:

      SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Time Zones\Sydney
      Standard Time

      NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for
      readability.

   7. Open the value TZI in your time zone key to get into the binary
      editor.

   8. You should see binary information like this:

      A8FDFFFF00000000C4FFFFFF0000030000000100020000000000000000000
      A00000005000200000000000000

      NOTE: The above binary information is one line; it has been wrapped
      for readability.

   9. Change this value to the following value:

      A8FDFFFF00000000C4FFFFFF0000030000000500020000000000000000000
      A00000005000200000000000000

      NOTE: The above binary information is one line; it has been wrapped
      for readability.

   10. Quit Registry editor and restart you computer.

   11. The system should now end Daylight Savings Time on the last Sunday
       in March.

</PRE><LI>You can also make the necessary registry changes using Regini.exe from
   the resource kit in conjunction with a text file that contains the
   following entries:
<P>
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion
   \Time zones\Cen. Australia Standard Time
   TZI = REG_BINARY 0x0000002c 0xfffffdc6 0x00000000 0xffffffc4 0x00030000
   0x00050000 0x00000002 0x00000000 0x000a0000 0x00050000 0x00000002
   0x00000000
<P>
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion
   \Time Zones\Sydney Standard Time
   TZI = REG_BINARY 0x0000002c 0xfffffda8 0x00000000 0xffffffc4 0x00030000
   0x00050000 0x00000002 0x00000000 0x000a0000 0x00050000 0x00000002
   0x00000000
<P>
   Create this text file using Edit.com or Notepad with word wrap turned
   off. The text file can only contain ascii text characters. The key
   name has to be on one line, and the value on the next line, the value
   being spaced in 4 spaces. Save the text file using any eight-dot-three
   standard name you like. Then use regini as per the example below.
<P>
   Example:
<P>
   regini &lt;filename&gt;
<P>
   This will automatically make the necessary changes for you.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.51
and 4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
