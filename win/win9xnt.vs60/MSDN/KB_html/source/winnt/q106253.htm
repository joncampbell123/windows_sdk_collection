<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When a program is started under Windows NT, it will have a priority class
that is either normal or equal to the priority class specified in the
command line when using the START command (Idle, Normal, High, or
Realtime). The priority class determines at which priority (from 1 to 31)
the program will run. In a multithreaded application, threads spawned by
the program can be lower or higher than the current priority class of the
program; however, all thread priorities will be relative to the priority
class of the parent program. While a program can change its priority class
after starting, all of its threads will still have the same relative
priority.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When a process spawns a thread, one of the parameters in the function call
sets the thread priority relative to the priority of the parent process.
This parameter can have one of the following values: Idle, Lowest, Below
Normal, Normal, Above Normal, Highest and Time Critical. The starting
priority set for the thread will be based upon that parameter and the
current priority of the process starting the thread. The priorities are as
follows:
<P>
<PRE>RELATIVE                  PROCESS PRIORITY CLASS
THREAD                Normal, in      Normal, in
PRIORITY       Idle   Background      Foreground    High    Realtime
</PRE> 
<PRE>Time Critical   15        15              15         15        31
Highest          6         9              11         15        26
Above Normal     5         8              10         14        25
Normal           4         7               9         13        24
Below Normal     3         6               8         12        23
Lowest           2         5               7         11        22
Idle             1         1               1          1        16

</PRE>The table above lists the base priority of a thread, which is set by
calling the function SetThreadPriority; however, a thread’s priority
can change as the thread executes. The system can boost a thread’s
priority higher as time goes on and then reduce the priority back down
to the base, though Windows NT will never reduce a thread lower than
its base priority. The system will boost a thread’s priority when a
user interacts directly with a thread, including mouse and keyboard
input or simply bringing the thread to the foreground.
