The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, and 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, and 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
You can configure Windows NT to dump system memory to a file called
MEMORY.DMP when a severe error (called a STOP error or fatal system error)
occurs. This log file can be valuable for debugging the cause of the STOP
error.
<P>
NOTE: Before troubleshooting the problem, ensure that the computer is
properly configured to save a crash dump file. For more information, see
Chapter 5 of your Windows NT Workstation or Windows NT Server "System
Guide."
<P>
The following are several reasons why the MEMORY.DMP file is not being
created when your computer encounters a STOP message:

<OL><P><LI>The MEMORY.DMP file already exists and the option Overwrite Any
   Existing File (found in Control Panel System) is not selected. It
   is a good idea to leave this box checked and to move or copy the
   current MEMORY.DMP file.

<P><LI>The paging file on the system drive is not large enough. To use the
   Write Debugging Information To feature, the paging file on the system
   drive must be large enough to hold all of physical RAM plus 1 megabyte.

<P><LI>The paging file is not on the system root partition. When the STOP
   error occurs, the system crash dump is written out to the pagefile on
   the root of the system drive (the drive of the %SYSTEMROOT% directory).

<P><LI>There is not room for the MEMORY.DMP file on the %SYSTEMROOT%
   partition. Although you can change the path for the location of the
   dump file using Control Panel, Windows NT writes the debugging
   information to the %SYSTEMROOT% partition first, and then moves the
   dump file to the path specified.

<P><LI>It is possible that the SCSI controller is bad or the system crash is
   caused by a bad SCSI controller board.

<P><LI>Certain computers and SCSI controllers do not permit the crash dump
   information to be created. To determine if more information is
   available, query on the following words in the Microsoft Knowledge
   Base:
<P>
<P><PRE>      &lt;your computer model&gt; and MEMORY.DMP
</PRE><P>
</OL>NOTE: The administrator can configure the computer to generate system
event log and to send alerts to specific computers or users upon a system
crash. This is a very useful feature of Windows NT for monitoring systems
for system crashes when away from computers and when system configured for
automatic reboot.
