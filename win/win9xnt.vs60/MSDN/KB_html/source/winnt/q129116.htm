The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5 and 3.51
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5 and 3.51
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you try to add workstations to a domain from Server Manager while logged
into the domain as a member of the Server Operators group (but not a member
of the Administrators group), the following error message appears:
<P>
<PRE>   Access is Denied

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Footnote 1 on page 64 of the Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5
"Concepts and Planning Guide" incorrectly states the following:
<P>
<PRE>   Member[s] of the domain's Administrators and Server Operators
   group can always add workstations to a domain, whether or not
   they have this right assigned to them. This right is needed only
   to enable users who are not members of these groups to add
   workstations to the domain.

</PRE>The footnote should say:
<P>
<PRE>   Members of the domain's Administrators and Account Operators
   groups can always add workstations to a domain, whether or not
   they have this right assigned to them. This right is needed only
   to enable users who are not members of these groups to add
   workstations to the domain.

</PRE><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem,

<UL><LI>Logon as an Account Operator
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Open User Manager for Domains, select User Rights from the Policies
   menu, choose the "Add Workstations to the Domain" right and add the
   Server Operators group.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.5 and
3.51. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
