The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you run UPDATE.EXE from US Service Pack 1 for Windows NT and
Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1, the update program does not
check the drive that Windows NT is installed on for free space. This
can result in a critical error which causes the update to fail. At
this point, the only option is to increase the free space on the drive
by removing files or moving files to another drive, and running the
update a second time.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The amount of space required by the update varies from system to
system, because only those files that are already installed on the
system will actually be replaced. The maximum amount of files to be
copied is just under 12 MB of free disk space on the partition
containing the %SYSTEMROOT%\SYSTEM32 directory. There must also be
enough space (about 150K) on the boot drive to replace NTLDR. Note
that this free space is only needed during the update process itself.
After the update program is finished, the system restarts and replaces
the old copies of the files with the updated versions. At this point,
all disk space used by the update program will be free.
<P>
If the update program does run out of disk space when it is copying
files, you will receive the following critical error message:
<P>
<PRE>  A critical error has occurred

  The destination disk is full

</PRE>This error prevents Setup from continuing. You can either retry the
operation or quit Setup. However, the software is not completely
installed. If you quit, therefore, you need to repeat the Setup
process from the beginning.
<P>
You will be given two options at this point: Retry and Exit. If you
choose Retry, the update attempts the file copy again and returns the
same critical error. If you choose Exit, Setup will stop. At this
point, you need to free up disk space by moving or deleting files.
