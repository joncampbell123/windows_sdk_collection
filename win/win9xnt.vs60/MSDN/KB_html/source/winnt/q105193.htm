<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When a User who was once a member of the Administrators group is
changed to another group (removed from the Administrators group), the
Connect to Printer option in Print Manager may disappear.
<P>
If the User has never logged on to their account while a member of
Administrators, this problem does not occur. Once that account has
been used at least once and the User is then placed in another group,
the Connect To Printer option disappears.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
There are currently two workarounds to this problem:

<UL><LI>Use Create Printer rather than Connect to Printer and to specify the
   network path to this printer. The disadvantage to this is that the
   printer driver will have to be loaded locally.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Recreate the account for this user without first giving this user
   Administrator rights. The disadvantage of this is that all the users
   settings, personal program groups, and other customized information
   will have to be recreated.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.1
and Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1. We are researching this
problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create 2 users in the User Manager. For reference, let us call
   one user User1, the other User2. Place User1 in the Power Users
   group, User2 in Administrators.

<P><LI>Log off, then log on as User2. Open Print Manager and note the
   availability of the option to Connect To Printer on the Printer menu.

<P><LI>Log off, then log on as User1. Again, note the availability of the
   Connect To Printer option. This user, as a member of the Power Users
   group, demonstrates the fact that a Power User should see this option.

<P><LI>Log off, then log on as Administrator. Remove User2 from the
   Administrators group and place this user into the Power Users group.

<P><LI>Log off, then log on as User2. Note that the option to Connect To
   Printer is no longer available.
