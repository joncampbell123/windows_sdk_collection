The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5 and 3.51
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5 and 3.51

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In most instances, data transfer over a Remote Access Service (RAS)
connection, or other forms of slow network links, is performed by the
Windows NT redirector using core mode, because one of the redirector
requirements for raw mode (that the I/O is to take no longer than 5 seconds
to complete) is not satisfied. You can change this time limit requirement
so that when all other requirements for raw mode are satisfied, data
transfer over RAS or other slow links can be performed using raw mode.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
You can configure the Windows NT redirector to accept a longer timeout
period by changing the registry value (shown below) so that this
requirement for raw mode might be more frequently satisfied when all other
requirements are also satisfied. This should result in more frequent raw
mode data transfers over RAS and other slow links.
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them.
Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of
Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

<OL><P><LI>Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

<P><LI>Go to the following registry key:
<P>
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Rdr\Parameters

<P><LI>If this value does not exist, you will need to add it using the
   following parameters:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Value name: RawIoTimeLimit
      Data type:  REG_DWORD
      Data range: 0-65535
      Default: 5 (seconds)
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: You must stop and restart the redirector, using the commands
   net stop rdr and net start rdr from a command prompt to put the new
   setting into effect.
<P>
</OL>The above registry value in place at a higher setting does not guarantee
that data transfer will always occur using raw mode, because there are
other requirements that must also be satisfied for the redirector to use
raw mode.
<P>
For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : Use of Raw Data Transfer Mode Influenced by Application

</PRE></OL>The redirector locks the virtual circuit (VC) during raw I/O data
transfers; therefore, all other pending I/O for that VC will not complete
until after the current raw I/O is completed. In the case of large raw I/O
(that is, a large file transfer with the above registry value in place at a
higher setting) the result is significant performance degradation for other
processes requiring access to the VC being used for the raw mode transfer.
