<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you attempt to access a file on a NTFS partition, a message appears
saying that file(s) are corrupt and that you should run CHKDSK.EXE to
repair the problem. After running CHKDSK.EXE, the problem reoccurs.
<P>
-or-
<P>
An application performing a write operation to the NTFS disk hang and other
applications may subsequently hang when they attempt to perform disk
operations.
<P>
NOTE: The file(s) indicated are NOT corrupted. Running CHKDSK.EXE is not
successful because CHKDSK.EXE has nothing to repair.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The problem is in the way that NTFS.SYS handles certain internal files
structures when multiple attributes are present.
<P>
While the problem is extremely difficult to reproduce, it is most likely to
affect files with 'extra' data attributes that are located in directories
with 'extra' data attributes. Files and directories in Services for
Macintosh (SFM) volumes have such extra data attributes, so the problem is
more likely to occur on these files. Files with long names in addition to
8.3 names and files manipulated with the POSIX subsystem which may have
additional named data streams are more likely to trigger the problem than
other NTFS files.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
When the error message appears, it is usually possible to retry the
operation successfully. It may be helpful to give the file a different
name, or to copy the file using a different technique.
<P>
If your computer hangs due to the application attempting to write to a
file, there is no option except to restart the operating system. Although
file system corruption is not likely, as with any improper (dirty) system
shutdown, user data may be lost.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT and Windows NT
Advanced Server version 3.1. This problem has been corrected in the latest
service pack for Windows NT 3.1 and in Windows NT Workstation and Windows
NT Server version 3.5.
