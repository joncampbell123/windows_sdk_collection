<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use an exclusion range with DHCP, addresses offered to clients may
not begin at the first address in the scope.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Leases offered to clients from a DHCP scope will be offered consecutively,
starting with the first address in the IP address pool. But if an exclusion
range is added to the scope, the first lease offered may not be the first
address in the IP address pool.
<P>
For example, if a scope is created using a starting address of
165.224.113.11 and an ending address of 165.224.113.249, the first lease
address offered to clients will be 165.224.113.11.
<P>
Alternatively, if an exclusion range of 165.224.113.100 to 165.224.113.120
is added to the scope, the first lease address offered will be
165.224.113.75. Leases will be offered consecutively through
165.224.113.249, skipping the excluded range. After 165.224.113.249, the
next leases offered will be 165.224.113.11 through 165.224.113.74
consecutively.
<P>
This may also occur when multiple ranges of addresses are included in
the DHCP scope.
