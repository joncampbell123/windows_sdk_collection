<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When Services for Macintosh (SFM) is installed on a Windows NT 3.5 Server,
Macintosh clients periodically appear to stop responding, even if they are
not directly accessing a mounted volume (the client is waiting for a
response from the Windows NT server). The amount of time that a client
waits for a response from the server depends on the volume layout and how
many files are in each directory.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When a shared directory is initially accessed by a Macintosh client, SFM
must read the entire contents of the directory and update the sub-section
of the volume catalog. If there are many files in the directory (several
thousand), the volume is exclusively locked until the catalog is updated.
This causes other Macintosh clients to wait for their requests to be
satisfied.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To correct this problem, upgrade to Windows NT 3.51 (if you have not
already done so) and install the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT
version 3.51.
<P>
Microsoft has modified the Windows NT version 3.51 file, SFMSRV.SYS, to
correct these problems. SFM Servers configured with large Macintosh
Accessible Volumes will still have large amounts of disk activity when the
server starts or when a volume is created. This may go on for several
minutes depending on how  large and complex directory structures are.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5 and
3.51. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Windows NT version 3.51. For information on obtaining the Service Pack,
