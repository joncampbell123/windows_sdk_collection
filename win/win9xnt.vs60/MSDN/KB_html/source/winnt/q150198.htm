<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you run a nightly backup of your system and during that period of time
you get network disconnect errors in the event log, it is very likely that
you are encountering bus contention between your network card and the SCSI
controller that may be hosting your tape backup unit.
<P>
Because SCSI controllers are most often involved in this type of issue,
this article focuses on SCSI, but bus contention can potentially affect the
function of any card or built-in accessory port in the system including
mice, video, keyboard, and any other I/O system.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
There are hardware issues that occur rarely and are on the surface
indistinguishable from software-based problems. These issues most often
occur when there are a number of same function cards in a given computer.
For example a given hardware platform has several different SCSI cards in
the system, one or more in the slots and perhaps an onboard (built-in) SCSI
controller in some of the more modern boards. This can occur with any group
of cards in a multi-interface system board (any combination of PCI, EISA
and ISA).
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
The best test (and potential workaround) for this problem is to choose an
ISA board to replace your PCI (or EISA) board's function (for example,
replace a PCI network card with an ISA network card) and see whether the
problem ceases. If substituting the ISA board eliminates the problem, you
may want to contact your various hardware vendors to investigate why and
where this conflict is occurring if you want to continue to use the card in
question.
<P>
An alternative is to simplify your setup. For example, you could place your
tape unit on the onboard SCSI chain and eliminate one of the extra SCSI
controllers. This issue should not occur in an all-ISA or all-EISA
configuration. Although with the ISA configuration you will have the
familiar problem of I/O address as IRQ conflict resolution, most of these
conflicts are self-evident.
