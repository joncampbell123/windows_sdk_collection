The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
You can use a variety of criteria to measure the performance of a
real-time system. The following are examples of the kinds of
measurements that might be used to determine real-time throughput:

<UL><LI>Longest critical region that the kernel blocks task activation
   during a system call

<LI>Maximum time that interrupts are disabled

<LI>Context switch time (scheduler time to save/restore registers,
   etc.) for threads within the same process (no change in memory
   context) and for threads in different processes (save/restore
   memory context)

<LI>Interrupt response time (latency between the occurrence and execution
   of the first instruction)

<LI>Interrupt task response time (worst case task dispatch latency for
   task waiting on the interrupt)

<LI>Performance of interprocess communication facilities (semaphores,
   queues, pipes, etc.)
<P>
</UL>Because such specifics are hard to measure, this article provides a
general discussion of the suitability of Windows NT as a real-time
system.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Users often want a total program development/GUI user environment,
virtual memory, and so forth, without any corresponding reduction in
response time. Real-time systems, however, are dedicated systems for
the duration of an "event." During that time, the system is
essentially locked, and no other activity can take place except that
real-time event. (Note that very few situations demand microsecond or
millisecond response time.)
<P>
Windows NT has the same basic structure as VMS. Windows NT has more
efficient mechanisms than RSX-11M. It has a better design than VAXELN,
which is a real-time embedded OS toolkit. All three of these systems
are very successful.
<P>
Although Windows NT has good real-time capabilities; it is not designed to
compete with  a special purpose real-time system. If you need such a
system, obtain the special real-time hardware and supporting operating
system.
