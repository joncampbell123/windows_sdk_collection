<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Windows NT version 3.1 should run on PCI bus computers if its SCSI and
video adapters are non-PCI or have a PCI driver specifically designed for
Windows NT version 3.1.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) standard is a local-bus technology
that is becoming increasingly common in new desktop computers. A blueprint
or specification rather than something physical, it is a method of holding
together PC components--the processor, memory, hard disk, etc.--that makes
PCI computers and peripherals differ from other computers and peripherals
currently available.
<P>
The March 1994 Windows NT Version 3.1 hardware compatibility list includes
a number of PCI bus computers. In general, Windows NT 3.1 should work on
PCI computers. The current Windows NT hardware abstraction layer (HAL)
does not support PCI functionality, but should allow Windows NT to run in
a mode that is ISA/EISA compatible.
<P>
If an adapter is working under Windows NT 3.1, it probably is running in a
non-PCI or ISA/EISA compatible mode. Problems are most likely to arise with
PCI adapters rather than PCI computers.
<P>
<P><h3>Support Issues for PCI Adapters</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>PCI computers should work with any adapter on the Windows NT hardware
   compatibility list (HCL).

<P><LI>Some, but not many, vendors are including PCI adapters in their PCI
   computers. To work with Windows NT 3.1, the adapter must include a
   Windows NT 3.1 PCI driver, and any driver support issues must be
   referred to the manufacturer. Presently there are no PCI adapters or
   peripherals on the Windows NT 3.1 HCL.

<P><LI>OEM Windows NT 3.1 PCI drivers do not enable Windows NT to support PCI
   functionality--they simply allow the PCI adapter to function in an
   ISA/EISA compatible mode, so it may work under Windows NT. Again, there
   are no plans to support PCI functionality under Windows NT 3.1.

<P><LI>PCI video adapters should work with Windows NT 3.1 because most of the
   calls work with standard video BIOS.

<P><LI>SCSI adapters may or may not work depending on the manufacturer's
   implementation.
