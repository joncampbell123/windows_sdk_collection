The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>U.S. Service Pack 1 for Microsoft Windows NT operating system and
   Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If Windows NT or Windows NT Advanced Server is installed on an NTFS volume
and the U.S. Service Pack 1 or CSD001 patch is applied, directory/file
permissions for the Everyone group will be reset to the default in any
directory that had files modified by the patch (such as ROOT, WINNT, and
WINNT\SYSTEM32 subdirectories). For example, if you change the permissions
for Everyone on drive C (which is NTFS, and contains the Windows NT
installation) and all its subdirectories to read-only. After you apply the
CSD or Service Pack, the permissions for Everyone will be reset to [RWXD]
in the C:\, C:\WINNT, C:\WINNT\SYSTEM32 and all other directories that had
files modified by the patch.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
After the application of the CSD or Service Pack, Windows NT or Windows NT
Advanced Server will need to be rebooted. During the reboot, if the
installation of Windows NT that had the patch applied is on an NTFS
partition, you receive the following message:
<P>
<PRE>   Setting Security on System Files...

</PRE>During this process, the permissions for Everyone are reset to their
default [RWXD] in the directories that had files modified by the patch.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT and
Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1. This problem was corrected in
the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT and Windows NT Advanced
Server version 3.1. For information on obtaining the Service Pack,
