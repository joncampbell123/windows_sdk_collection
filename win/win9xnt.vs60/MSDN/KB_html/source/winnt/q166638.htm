<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how policies take effect in Windows NT 4.0 based on
an automatic download of the Ntconfig.pol policy file. It assumes that the
reader has some basic knowledge of using policies in Windows NT 4.0.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
There may be some confusion as to when the default user policy takes
effect, when it is included in the Ntconfig.pol file with specific users or
groups. The order of the implementation is as follows:

<OL><P><LI>If the default user is the only implemented policy, it will affect
   all users.

<P><LI>If the default user and a specific user have overlapping implementations
   in the file, the specific user takes precedence. (In other words,
   the default user policy will be ignored.)

<P><LI>If the default user and a global group have overlapping implementations
   in the policy file, the global group takes precedence.

<P><LI>If all three items are in the policy file, the specific user always
   takes precedence.

<P><LI>Because there are no groups with computers, the default computer policy
   takes effect unless a specific computer name is included in the
   policy file.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: There are three states in which a policy exists: checked, cleared, or
gray. The preceding scenario describes their precedence for each policy
item (user, group, and default user).
<P>
If the policy file contains only groups and the default user, then for a
user to obtain the proper policy through his or her group membership, the
settings must be checked or cleared for that user's group. In other words,
if a group setting is left gray, and the default user has that policy
implemented (check or cleared), the policy will be determined
according to the default user.
<P>
However, a specific user policy always takes precedence over group and
default user policies, regardless of whether an option is gray or
implemented.
