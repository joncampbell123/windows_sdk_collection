SUMMARY
 
<P>
During an unattended setup of Windows NT 4.0, it may be beneficial to map a
network drive in the of middle setup. Mapping drives during setup allows
you to load balance your servers, have your distribution share on one
server, and an application share on another.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
An entry in the Cmdlines.txt will be used to map a drive during setup. This
is possible because Cmdlines.txt is run after Machine Name is set and the
Network is started.
<P>
[Commands]
<PRE>   ".\net use s: \\server\share /user:Domainname\Username /persistent:no"
   "s:\internet\msie30.exe /Q /R:N"
   "s:\sp\update -u -z -n"

</PRE>NOTE: Use the /user: parameter because Windows NT setup is run using the
System Account, which does not have a user account associated with it.
<P>
NOTE: Use /user:Domainname\Username Password - if the username has a
password associated with it.
<P>
The /persistent parameter is used to ensure that the drive letter is not
automatically reconnected when logging on. It is best to force a static
drive letter than use a dynamic letter, which, by default, picks the next
available drive letter. In the above example, it is assumed that an
Internet Explore package has been built with the Internet Admin Kit and has
been place on the distribution server in a directory called Internet.
<P>
Depending on the rollout of Windows NT 4.0, it may be beneficial to enable
the Guest Account on the Application Share, and connect with a
/user:Domainname\Guest. This will ensure that, if a computer can get on the
network, but cannot be validated by a domain controller, setup can still be
completed.
