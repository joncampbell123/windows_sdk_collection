<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
There are cases when the Autodial feature in Windows NT 4.0 will not be
invoked. The following information describes how autodial works with
various name resolution procedures.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor
can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.
<P>
For Winsock applications, Autodial is engaged through gethostbyname() and
connect() failures only. This means that pinging an IP address will not
invoke Autodial, because a ping sends ICMP packets. However, pinging a DNS
hostname such as www.microsoft.com will invoke Autodial. This is because
ping calls gethostbyname() to translate the DNS hostname into an IP
address.
<P>
If you are connected to a LAN locally, Autodial will only engage when an
attempt to reach an IP address has failed, and there is already a mapping
for the address in the registry for Autodial.
<P>
Registry entries for Autodial mappings are located at the following
location:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\RAS Autodial\Addresses

</PRE>If you have booted a using a hardware profile that has no LAN adapter, or
you have no LAN adapter, Autodial will engage regardless of whether the
address is in its database or not.
<P>
Each entry under the \Addresses key includes a Network value, which
corresponds with one RAS connectoid (such as 'NETWORK0') under the
following Registry key:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\RAS Autodial\Networks

</PRE>This Network value enables Autodial to know which RAS connection to dial to
connect to the specified server.
<P>
The registry also holds a database for addresses it will ignore. The
entries are located at:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\RAS Autodial
   \Control\DisabledAddresses

   NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for
   readability.

</PRE>There are two types of address aliasing that Autodial applies when
determining which RAS phonebook entry to dial:

<UL><LI>Domain name aliasing: &lt;name1&gt;.microsoft.com is equivalent to
   &lt;name2&gt;.microsoft.com or any other hostname of the form *.microsoft.com.

<LI>WWW aliasing: www.microsoft.com is equivalent to www.netscape.com or
   any other hostname of the form 'www.*'.
<P>
</UL>This means that if the original address is not found in the database, then
the aliasing rules are applied in attempt to find a suitable RAS phonebook
entry.
