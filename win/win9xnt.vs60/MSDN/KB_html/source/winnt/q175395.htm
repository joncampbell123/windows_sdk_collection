<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When performing the setup for Small Business Server client computers, it is
necessary to remove any installed third-party network components. These
components prevent the installation of the Small Business Server client
software and networking components. It is impossible for client setup to
detect every third-party networking component. It is impossible for
Microsoft to change the detection mechanism because of the fact that
third-party software can be upgraded or modified frequently. This prevents
the third-party components from being removed during setup. They are only
detected and the user is notified that they must be removed.
<P>
The information provided below is intended to provide an overview of how to
remove these products. The third-party products discussed here are
manufactured by vendors independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty,
implied or otherwise, regarding these products' performance or reliability.
Microsoft does not provide support for these products and will not assist
in the removal of these products in any manner other than providing general
information as specified in this document.

<P>
To uninstall the Novell 32-bit network client, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Remove the client in Network properties. To do so, follow these steps:
<P>
   a. In Control Panel, double-click Network.
<P>
   b. Click the Novell 32-bit client, and then click Remove.
<P>
   c. Click the Novell 32-bit IPX protocol, and then click Remove.

<P><LI>Add the Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks. This step ensures that
   registry entries created by the Novell installation program are
   overwritten. After you install the Microsoft client and restart the
   computer, you can either remove the Microsoft client or leave it
   installed. To add the Microsoft client, follow these steps:
<P>
   a. In Network properties, click Add.
<P>
   b. Click Client, and then click Add.
<P>
