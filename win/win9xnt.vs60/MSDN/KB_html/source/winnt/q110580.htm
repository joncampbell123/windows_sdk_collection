<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
By design, the Emergency Repair Disk created by a Network or Unsupported CD-
ROM installation cannot be used to verify Windows NT system files.
<P>
However, many users add CD-ROM drives to their systems after installing
Windows NT and need to be able to run Emergency Repair when necessary.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
WARNING: The following workaround may cause system-wide problems that may
<PRE>   require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft cannot
   guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of following can be
   resolved without reinstalling. Use this workaround at your own risk.

</PRE>To run an Emergency Repair Disk after installing a supported adapter and CD-
ROM drive, do the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Edit the Repair.BootFiles and Repair.WinntFiles sections in REPAIR.INF
   on the Emergency Repair Disk so that all references to source files
   point to their new location. For example, if you initially ran the
   unsupported CD-ROM setup, all references to $WIN_NT$.~LS should be
   changed to i386.

<P><LI>Boot from the Setup Disk for CD-ROM Installation.

<P><LI>At the first blue screen, press the R key (for Repair).

<P><LI>When prompted to do so, insert the modified Emergency Repair Disk that
   was originally created for this computer.
<P>
   You will be prompted to insert the Windows NT Setup CD if you haven’t
   already done so.

<P><LI>Three selections appear and all three will be selected by default. Move
   the selector bar with the arrow keys to highlight the options. Use the
   SPACEBAR to select/clear the options. Select the desired option(s).

<P><LI>Move the selector bar to the line that says to Continue and press the
   ENTER key.
<P></OL>
