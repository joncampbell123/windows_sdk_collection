IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it
if a problem occurs. For information on how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" online Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry
Key" online Help topic in Regedt32.exe.
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Regardless of the protocols being used, You may receive the following error
message:
<P>
<PRE>   Could not find domain controller for this domain.

</PRE>The same error can occur even though LMHOSTS files and the WINS database
are correct. No connectivity problems of any kind exist on the network.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
A mechanism was provided with Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3 and in a hotfix
for Windows NT 3.51 that allows for administrators to restrict the ability
for anonymous logon users (also known as NULL session connections) to list
account names and enumerate share names.
<P>
This registry setting also restricts a trusting domain from establishing a
connection to the trusted primary domain controller to establish a trust
relationship.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Set the RestrictAnonymous value to 0 in the registry, or remove the value
and the trust can be established.
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall Windows. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be
solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and
Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" online Help
topics in Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before
you edit it.

<OL><P><LI>Run Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

<P><LI>Go to the following key in the registry:
<P>
<P><PRE>      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\LSA
</PRE>
<P><LI>Select the following value:
<P>
<P><PRE>      RestrictAnonymous
</PRE>
<P><LI>On the Edit menu, click DWORD and change the data (value) to 0, as
   reflected in the following information:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Value Name: RestrictAnonymous
      Data Type:  REG_DWORD
<PRE></PRE>      Value:      0

</PRE><P><LI>Exit Registry Editor and restart the computer for the change to take
   effect.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.51
and 4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The purpose of the registry value is to configure local system policy for
whether authentication is required to perform common enumeration functions.
Requiring authentication to obtain the account name list is an optional
feature. When the RestrictAnonymous value is set to 1, anonymous
connections from the Graphical User Interface tools for security management
will receive an access denied error when attempting to get the list of
account names. When the RestrictAnonymous value is set to 0, or the value
is not defined, anonymous connections will be able to list account names
and enumerate share names. It should be noted that even with the value of
RestrictAnonymous set to 1, although the user interface tools with the
system will not list account names, there are Win32 programming interfaces
to support individual name lookup that do not restrict anonymous
connections.
<P>
Windows NT networks using a multiple domain model can restrict anonymous
connections without loss of functionality. The initial steps in planning to
disable anonymous connections is for administrators in resource domains to
add members of trusted account domains to specific local groups as needed
before changing the value for the LSA RestrictAnonymous registry entry.
Users logged on using accounts from trusted account domains will continue
to use authenticated connections to obtain list of account names to manage
security access control.
