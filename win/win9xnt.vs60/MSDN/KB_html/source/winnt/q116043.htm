<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When two computers access a shared file or application on a network share
where the limit of connections is set to two, a third computer is still
unable to access the shared file or application even after one of the other
two computers have closed the file or quit the application.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
By design, a dormant network connection remains alive for 10 minutes after
a computer quits a shared file or application on a network share.
<P>
In the case above, the computer that closed the shared file or quit the
shared application still has a dormant network connection and because the
network share is limited to two, the third computer is still unable to
access the shared file or application.
<P>
NOTE: Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 behaves the same way.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To delete a dormant network connection:

<UL><LI>From the computer with the dormant connection, use the following command
   to delete the connection:
<P>
<P><PRE>      NET USE \\server\share /d
</PRE><P>
   -or-

<LI>From the server, an administrator can use the following command to
   delete the dormant connection:
<P>
<P><PRE>      net sess \\computername /d
