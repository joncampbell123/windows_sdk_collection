<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
A computer with an EISA bus running Windows NT version 3.1 may not be able
to start the ATI video adapter driver (any type) with an Adaptec 174x
adapter present, and the following messages may appear in the Event Viewer:
<P>
<PRE>   Event ID: 7026  Source: Service Control Manager   Type: Error
   Description: The following boot-start or system-start driver(s)
   failed to load: ATI

   Event ID: 22  Source: ATI   Type: Error
   Description: A conflict has been detected between two drivers
   which claimed two overlapping IO port regions. Driver Aha 174x,
   with device &lt;\Device\ScsiPort0.Translated&gt;, claimed an IO port
   range with starting address in data address 0x28 and 0x2c, and
   length in data address 0x30.

   Event ID: 22  Source: ATI   Type: Error
   Description: A conflict has been detected between two drivers
   which claimed two overlapping IO port regions. Driver ATI,
   with device &lt;\Device\Video0.Translated&gt;, claimed an IO port
   range with starting address in data address 0x28 and 0x2c, and
   length in data address 0x30.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs due to the ATI adapter using EISA address space for its
extended registers, thus conflicting with devices situated on or beyond
slot 4 on the EISA bus.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To correct this problem, do one of the following:
<P>
<PRE>   - Place the Adaptec 174x SCSI adapter card on a slot other than slot 4;
     for example, slots 1 to 3.

   -or-

   - Upgrade to Windows NT Workstation or Windows NT Server version 3.5.

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT and Windows NT
Advanced Server version 3.1. This problem has been corrected in Windows NT
Workstation and Windows NT Server version 3.5.
<P>
The Adaptec and ATI products discussed here are manufactured by vendors
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise,
regarding these products' performance or reliability.
