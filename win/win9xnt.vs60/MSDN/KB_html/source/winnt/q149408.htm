<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When the AT Scheduler is used to run a job under the System account that
connects to a Novell server, the following error message appears:
<P>
<PRE>   System error 5 has occurred -  Access is denied.

</PRE><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To correct this problem, add the name of the user to the end of the NET USE
command using the /User:&lt;userid&gt; parameter, where the user ID is a member
of the Novell server's NTGATEWAY group.
<P>
When you are connecting to network resources, it is recommended that you
use the Scheduler services with the Log On As User Account option when
possible.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This information applies to operators using a Windows NT Workstation with
Client Services for NetWare or those using a Windows NT Server with Gateway
Services for NetWare. When performing a connection to a Novell server in
the Scheduler service environment, you must specify a user ID if the
Scheduler service is configured to log on with the System account. No
problems arise when the Scheduler service is configured to log on with a
user ID that has Administrator rights on the NT computer and is also a
valid user ID on the Novell server.
<P>
Connecting to the Novell server is not a problem from File Manager and
Command Prompts using a valid account on the Novell server. However, when
the same commands using the same account are run using the AT Scheduler
started with the Log On As System Account option, the following response
appears
with the NET USE command when you try to connect to a Novell server:
<P>
<PRE>   NET USE * \\NOVELLSRV\SYS /USER:valid_Novell_userid
   The password is invalid for \\NOVELLSRV\SYS.

   Type the password for \\NOVELLSRV\SYS: &lt;CORRECT PASSWORD ENTERED&gt;
   System error 5 has occurred.

   Access is denied.
