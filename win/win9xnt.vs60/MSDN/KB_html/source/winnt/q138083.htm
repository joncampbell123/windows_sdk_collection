<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how to implement the %SERVERNAME% environment
variable in the user profile path of the Windows NT User Manager. This
environment variable must be set on the workstation computer, not the
domain controller.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you have configured a user's profile path in User Manager, the entry
looks similar to this:
<P>
<PRE>   UserProfiles
   User Profile Path: \\%SERVERNAME%\profiles\user1.usr

</PRE>The %SERVERNAME% variable provides load balancing and performance
improvements. As Administrator, you can spread the load of processing user
profiles to another server by setting the SERVERNAME environment variable
to the name that is located close to the workstation. When a user logs
into the domain, they are directed to \\%SERVERNAME%, where %SERVERNAME%
has been set to the name of a server, for example, "Server1".
<P>
The profile server should be close to the client's computer (not located
across a slow link) to expedite log on. For example, on all workstations in
Phoenix, set the variable to a Server name that is located in Phoenix. On
workstations in Seattle, set the variable to a Server name that is
located in Seattle. That way, when a user is in Phoenix, his or her logon
script is executed on a controller in Phoenix. When that user visits
Seattle, his or her logon script is executed on a controller in Seattle.
<P>

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them.
Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of
Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

<OL><P><LI>Log on to a to the domain as "Administrator".

<P><LI>Run the Registry Editor (REGEDIT32.EXE) and select the workstation's
   computer name from the list.

<P><LI>Be sure to select the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE of the workstation you have
   connected to, not your computers' HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE.

<P><LI>From the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following key:
<P>
<P><PRE>      \SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Mgr\Environment
</PRE>
<P><LI>From the Edit menu, select Add Value.

<P><LI>Enter the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Value Name: SERVERNAME
      Data Type:  REG_SZ
<PRE></PRE>      String:     &lt;Server1&gt;

</PRE><P><LI>Click OK and quit the Registry Editor.

<P><LI>Shut down and restart Windows NT.

<P><LI>Open User Manager on a domain controller.

<P><LI>Edit one of the user accounts. For example:"user1". In the Profile, set
<P><PRE>    the User's Profile Path to:
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       \\%SERVERNAME%\share\user1.usr
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    Make sure that there is a shared directory on Server1.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Exit User Manager.

<P><LI>Enter the User Profile Editor.

<P><LI>Select the user that you want to access this profile, "user1".

<P><LI>Make the appropriate changes.

<P><LI>Save this to a file and place it on \\&lt;Server1&gt;\&lt;share&gt;.

<P><LI>Have the user log on to the domain.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: The directory where the profiles reside must be shared. In this
example, the directory PROFILES was given a share name of "share". This
must be done on every Server that participates. In this case, there is only
one Server (Server1) involved.
