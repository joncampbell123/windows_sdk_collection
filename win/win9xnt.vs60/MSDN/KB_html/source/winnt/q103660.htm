The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Memory installed on an ALR add-on card that extends memory above 16
MB in an ALR Business VEISA 486 may not be recognized by Windows NT.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
There are two possible causes of this problem:

<UL><LI>Improper settings in the CMOS setup
<LI>Mismatched SIMMs
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Improper Settings in the CMOS Setup</h3>
 
<P>
There is a setting on the second page of the CMOS setup that can be
toggled between "16MB" and "No Limit." This setting must be set to No
Limit. If this setting is set to 16MB, the system memory count still
accounts for all memory (32 MB for example); however, the system will
be forced to recognize only 16 MB. In addition, on the second page of
the CMOS setup, the setting "MAP FE0000-FFFFFF to RAM" must be
enabled.
<P>
<P><h3>Mismatched SIMMs</h3>
 
<P>
ALR recommends using only 4-MB SIMMs from Toshiba or Samsung, and all
SIMMs must be from the same manufacturer (that is, you can't have two
4-MB SIMMs from Toshiba and two 4-MB SIMMs from Samsung). Mixing SIMMs
from different manufacturers may cause parity errors, or the memory
may not be recognized as being installed at all. ALR also recommends
that the speed of the SIMMs be 80 nanoseconds or faster.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
You can also run the VEISA configuration utility version 2.08 to
ensure that the machine is recognizing the installed memory.
<P>
The ALR (Advanced Logic Research), Toshiba, and Samsung products
mentioned here are manufactured by vendors independent of Microsoft;
we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these products'
performance or reliability.
