The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Network Client for MS-DOS, version 3.0
<LI>Microsoft LAN Manager for MS-DOS, version 2.2c
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
MS-DOS - based computers without Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version
3.11 must install an MS-DOS client to access Windows NT servers. The
Windows NT Server version 3.5 CD-ROM includes two MS-DOS clients in the
CLIENTS directory:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Network Client for MS-DOS, version 3.0
<LI>Microsoft LAN Manager for MS-DOS, version 2.2c
<P>
</UL>Microsoft Network Client version 3.0 replaces Microsoft Workgroup Add-On
for MS-DOS and Microsoft Workgroup Connection. It is the preferred MS-DOS
client, except for remoteboot configurations. Microsoft will continue to
make the Microsoft Workgroup Add-On for MS-DOS available for customers who
want its file and print server capabilities.
<P>
This article discusses the key differences between these two MS-DOS - based
clients, to assist users in selecting the appropriate client.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Both clients include basic and full redirectors. The full redirectors are
faster and provide more functions, but they use more memory and disk space.
<P>
<P><h3>System Requirements</h3>
 
<P>
Both clients have the following minimum requirements:

<UL><LI>Intel 8088 or higher processor (80286 for full redirectors)
<LI>640 kilobytes (K) RAM
<LI>1 megabyte (MB) free hard disk space
<LI>Supported network interface card
<LI>MS-DOS version 3.3 or higher
<LI>Windows version 3.1x is optional
   (should not be used with Windows for Workgroups)
<P>
</UL>Clients that have additional requirements are annotated in the following
sections.
<P>
<P><h3>Identical TCP/IP on Both Clients</h3>
 
<P>
The same TCP/IP binaries ship with both MS-DOS - based clients. These MS-
DOS - based clients provide Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
client support, WINS resolution, and Windows Sockets support. However, they
do not have the following features that are provided by TCP/IP-32 for
Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 and Windows NT Server and Workstation
version 3.5:

<UL><LI>Support DNS resolution using WINS.
<LI>Support WINS resolution using DNS.
<LI>Name registration with the WINS database.
   (MS-DOS -based computers are clients, not servers, and do not generally
   need registration.)
<LI>Act as a WINS proxy node.
<LI>Have multihomed support.
<LI>Support IGMP.
<LI>DHCP command-line switches for the IPCONFIG command.
   (Must use the DHCP Administration Utility instead.)
<P>
</UL><h3>Microsoft Network Client Version 3.0</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft has optimized this client to work with Windows NT version 3.5
servers, and will be the focus of future development efforts for MS-DOS -
based clients for Windows NT.
<P>
This client includes MS-DOS TCP/IP, MS-IPX, NetBEUI and Microsoft DLC
protocols. Both full and basic redirectors can load any three of these four
protocols.
<P>
This client is faster and easier to install than LAN Manager for MS-DOS
version 2.2c, even when you upgrade from a previous version of the LAN
Manager client.
<P>
Over-the-network installation onto a clean MS-DOS - based computer is
available for this client through Windows NT Server's Network Client
Administrator.
<P>
This client is derived from the Workgroup Add-On for MS-DOS version 3.11
product, but does not include the following:

<UL><LI>MS-Mail client
<LI>Real mode server (that is, it cannot share files)
<P>
</UL>Full redirector
<UL><LI>Required if using Microsoft Windows or Remote Access Service (RAS)
<LI>Supports LAN Manager APIs, including domain logons
<LI>Uses 88K RAM, plus memory for protocols
<LI>Requires Intel 80286 or later processor
<LI>Is the default redirector
<P>
</UL>Basic redirector
<UL><LI>Supports connecting to shared files and printers
<LI>Uses 10K RAM, plus memory for protocols
<LI>Required for 8088 processors
<P>
</UL>This client does not support RemoteBoot.
<P>
This client does not support SPX, nor asynchronous-named pipes when the
client is running Windows in enhanced mode. It does support all other
client APIs, including NetBIOS, TCP/IP, and IPX.
<P>
This client does not provide a Browse Master. In order to browse the
network, a computer running Windows for Workgroups or Windows NT must be on
the network and belong to the same workgroup as the computer running
Network Client.
<P>
This client only supports the inventory capabilities of Microsoft Systems
Management Server version 1.0. This limitation is due to a
restriction in the NetBIOS interface. For additional information, please
see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../sms/q121852.htm">Q121852</A></B>
   TITLE     : Network Client Support for Systems Management Server

</PRE><h3>Microsoft LAN Manager for MS-DOS, Version 2.2c</h3>
 
<P>
This client adds DHCP and WINS client support and bug fixes to the LAN
Manager version 2.2b client. This client does not provide any advantages
over Microsoft Network Client, except for its RemoteBoot capability.
<P>
This client includes MS-DOS TCP/IP, NetBEUI, and Microsoft DLC protocols. A
NetWare Connectivity disk is also available.
<P>
This client does not support over-the-network installation.
<P>
There is no automatic upgrade available from an earlier version of LAN
Manager for this client. Users must save configuration information for
reference purposes, remove the earlier version, and then install version
2.2c.
<P>
This client supports RemoteBoot.
<P>
Full redirector
<UL><LI>Allows multiple protocols and adapters on one computer
<LI>Uses 100K RAM, plus memory for protocols
<LI>Requires 4 MB disk space
<LI>Supports named pipes
<P>
</UL>Basic redirector
<UL><LI>Uses 59K RAM, plus memory for protocols
<LI>Allows single protocol and adapter on one computer
