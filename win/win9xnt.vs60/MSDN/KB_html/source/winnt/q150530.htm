The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5 and 3.51
<LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
After you add newly created user accounts to a domain, you may notice that
Windows 95 clients cannot log on to the domain with any of the newly
created accounts. The Windows 95 clients will report the following error:
<P>
<PRE>   User name cannot be found

</PRE>The same Windows 95 clients can log on to the domain with previously
existing user accounts. You will also notice that Windows NT workstations
can log on to the domain with these newly created accounts.
<P>
Check the primary domain controllers (PDCs) Event Viewer Security Log for
the following:
<P>
Event ID 529
Description:
Logon Failure:
<PRE>   Reason:     Unknown user name or bad password
   User Name:  GUEST
   Domain:     NameOfYourDomain
   Logon Type: 3
   Logon Process: NCPSrv
   Authentication Package:
   Workstation Name:

</PRE>NOTE: Your entries may vary, that is, the user name will not always
be GUEST.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The above scenario has been linked to other domain controllers in the
domain running out of resources. At this point, you will need to check all
of the servers in the domain that validate user accounts.
<P>
Check all the servers in the domain that validate user accounts for:

<UL><LI>servers that are running out of disk space.
<LI>servers that have stopped responding (this may mean actually visiting
   the server).
<LI>servers that report Event IDs stating they have not been able to
   synchronize with the PDC. The server will report that insufficient
   system resources exist to complete the requested service.
<P>
</UL>After you find the domain controller with insufficient system resources,
you may either take that server offline, so that it is not involved in the
validation process, or fix the resource problem and re-synchronize the
domain controller with its PDC. If the problem persists, you may need to
take a trace of the Windows 95 computer while it is trying to log on to the
domain to help further identify problem areas.
