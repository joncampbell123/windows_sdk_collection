<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system, version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause
<PRE>    serious, system-wide problems that may require you to
    reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft cannot
    guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of
    Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own
    risk.


</PRE><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Users who have floating or mandatory user profiles cannot receive Chat
conversations on computers other than the one on which their original
profile was created. Similarly, they will not be able to successfully
create Clipbook Viewer pages or play Hearts. If a profile is created
on the computer they will use, these applications will function on their
own computer, but not on other computers. If their initial profile is
created on an administrator's computer, these applications will not work
on any computer.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When Network DDE validates a conversation, it first checks to see if
the DDE share is listed as a trusted share for the user logged on to
the computer sharing the conversation. It does this by opening the
following Registry subkey
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\NetDDE
   \DDE Trusted Shares\DDEDBi&lt;xxxxxxx&gt;

</PRE>where &lt;xxxxxxx&gt; is a serial number found in the SharesDBInstance value
of the following subkey:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\NetDDE\DDE Shares

</PRE>This serial number is statistically unique on each computer and serves
to tie the Trusted Shares list to the computer on which the shares are
trusted. These keys are created during setup. For floating and
mandatory profiles, the DDEDBi&lt;xxxxxxx&gt; subkey will contain only the
entry for the computer on which the profile was created. When Network
DDE attempts to open the DDEDBi&lt;xxxxxxx&gt; subkey on other computers,
the attempt fails since other computers do not have the same serial
numbers. This behavior disallows Network DDE conversations from being
established.
<P>
NOTE: You must be a member of the Users, Power Users, Server
Operators, or Administrators group in order to create Clipbook pages.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, create floating profiles on the
workstation that the user is likely to work on. You can also enable
Network DDE applications to work on a particular computer by
manipulating values in the Registry. You need to copy the DDE trusted
shares information from the target computer's default profile into the
user's online profile. You must have administrative privileges on the
target computer in order to perform these actions:

<OL><P><LI>Start Registry Editor (REGEDT32.EXE) on the remote workstation or
    the target computer.

<P><LI>If you logged on to the remote workstation, choose Select Computer
    from the Registry menu to look at the Registry database on the
    target computer.

<P><LI>In the target computer's Registry database, move to the following
    subkey and make a note of the subkey name that is in the form of
    DDEDBi&lt;xxxxxxxx&gt;:
<P>
       HKEY_USERS\.DEFAULT\Software\Microsoft\NetDDE
       \DDE Trusted Shares

<P><LI>Select the DDEDBi&lt;xxxxxxxx&gt; subkey and choose Save Key from the
    Registry menu, saving the file to a UNC path with the following
    format:
<P>
       \\&lt;computer name&gt;\&lt;share name&gt;\&lt;path&gt;

<P><LI>Select HKEY_USERS on Local Machine and choose Load Hive from the
    Registry menu. Load the floating or mandatory profile from the
    shared directory indicated in the user's account under Profile
    Information (this is the location that the profile is downloaded
    from when the user logs on). Use any name for the key when
    prompted (TEST for example).

<P><LI>Under the loaded user profile (TEST), select the following subkey:
<P>
       Software\Microsoft\NetDDE\DDE Trusted Shares

<P><LI>From the Edit menu, choose Add Key and enter the name you noted in
    step 3.

<P><LI>Select the new DDEDBi&lt;xxxxxxx&gt; subkey and choose Restore from the
    Registry menu. When prompted, enter the same path to the saved key
    that you used in step 4.

<P><LI>Use the Security Permissions command to change the new
    DDEDBi&lt;xxxxxxxx&gt; subkey to have the same permission as the other
    DDEDBi&lt;xxxxxxxx&gt; subkey that is next to it. Be sure to change all
    subkeys by choosing Replace Permission On Existing Subkeys in
    the Permissions dialog box.

<P><LI>Select the root key of this hive (TEST) and choose Unload Hive
    from the Registry menu.
<P>
</OL><h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Clipbook, Chat, and Hearts rely upon Network DDE to operate. Network
DDE is a protocol for sending DDE messages across a network. Similar
to the way in which directories may be shared across the network, a
DDE conversation can be "shared" on the network. The Network DDE DSDM
service maintains a database of shared conversations on each computer.
When you share a page in Clipbook, a Network DDE share is created in
this database. Similarly, in order for Chat to operate, Setup creates
a Network DDE share for Chat.
<P>
When a Network DDE share is accessed over a network, the shared
conversation is referenced, and appropriate security checks are made
to make sure the requester can be granted access. For some shared
conversations, an application must be running on the computer sharing
the conversation--for example, any time a linked item needs to be
updated, or when a Chat conversation is started with someone. In
either case, the application that placed the information in Clipbook
(Microsoft Excel for example) or Chat must be running in order to
service the request. All applications on a computer are running in the
"security context" of the user who is interactively logged on to the
computer. Therefore, when a remote request is serviced by a running
application on a computer sharing a Network DDE conversation, the
application handling the request is running in the security context of
the person logged on to the sharing computer, not in the remote user's
security context.
<P>
With this design, there is the potential for security violations.
Conceivably, a user could share a Network DDE conversation and
remotely connect to it while someone else was logged on, thus enabling
the user to access the sharing computer as if he or she were the other
logged on user. To avoid this situation, in order for a shared
conversation to be used, the logged on user at the time of use must
have this shared conversation in its list of trusted shares.
<P>
When Windows NT is installed, the following Registry value
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\NetDDE
   \DDE Shares\SharesDBInstance

</PRE></OL>is set to a random number in order to uniquely identify the computer.
The Chat$, CLPBK$, and Hearts$ keys are also created under the
following subkey:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_USERS\Default\Software\Microsoft\NetDDE
   \DDE Trusted Shares\DDEDBi&lt;xxxxxxxx&gt;

</PRE>The &lt;xxxxxxxx&gt; value in this key name is obtained from the random
number entered in the SharesDBInstance value, as mentioned above. When
a new user logs on or a floating or mandatory profile is created on a
computer, these keys and values are copied into the user's profile.
This means that the user's profile has all the Network DDE keys the
user will need for the computer that he or she first logs on to or
that the profile is created on. However, the user does not have
similar entries for other computers that the user may log on to. When
Network DDE is asked to add a trusted share for a user, a new
DDEDBi&lt;xxxxxxxx&gt; key should be created. Instead, Network DDE attempts
to open this key and the attempt fails because the key does not exist.
<P>
The Trusted Shares list and the list of Network DDE shares are kept in
the Registry and in general should not be directly modified. However,
to work around this problem, it is easiest to manually patch the
Registry as described in the "Workaround" section above.
