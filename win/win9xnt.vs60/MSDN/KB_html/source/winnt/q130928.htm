The information in this article applies to:

<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article outlines how you can restore, from tape, one computer profile
onto another computer. This procedure is intended for Intel-based (X86)
computers.
<P>
The procedure can be used to transfer your basic operating system (OS)
configuration from an Intel 486 computer to an Intel Pentium computer. This
procedure assumes that the tape drives on the original and new computer
have a compatible tape format.
<P>
NOTE: Windows NT backup is intended to be used as a disaster recovery
utility to maintain your system by backing it up and restoring it to the
SAME computer. When you restore to a different computer you may encounter
problems, due to hardware differences between the two computers.
<P>
This is an unsupported use of Windows NT backup. Microsoft makes no
warranty, implied or otherwise, that it will restore your system correctly.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If the HDD controller (either IDE or SCSI) on the new computer is the same
type of controller used on the previous computer:

<OL><P><LI>From the original computer, perform a backup of the complete OS and all
   other files that you wish to transfer.
<P>
   NOTE: If you are using Windows NT Backup, be sure you backup the
   registry (this requires administrator privileges).

<P><LI>Load Windows NT onto the new computer.
<P>
   Partition and drive information should be set up the same as the
   original computer. The partition sizes on the new computer should be at
   least as big as the partitions on the original computer.

<P><LI>Load the backup software for the tape drive that is attached to
   the new computer.

<P><LI>From tape, restore the complete OS and all necessary files into
   directories of the same name as the original computer. Be sure to
   restore the Registry.

<P><LI>Reboot the computer.
<P>
</OL>The original computers profile is now restored onto the new computer.
<P>
If the original computer has a SCSI controller and you want to restore
Windows NT onto a computer with a different SCSI controller:

<OL><P><LI>Before you make your complete back up of the original computer,
   load the driver for the SCSI controller that is in the new computer.

<P><LI>Reboot the computer.

<P><LI>An error appears stating "One or more services failed to load."
   Continue.

<P><LI>Perform a back up of the complete OS and all other files that you
   wish to transfer.

<P><LI>Load Windows NT onto the new computer.
<P>
   Partition and drive information should be set up the same as the
   original computer. The partition sizes on the new computer should be at
   least as big as the partitions on the original computer.

<P><LI>Load the backup software for the tape drive that is attached to
   the new computer.

<P><LI>From tape, restore the complete OS and all necessary files into
   directories of the same name as the original computer. Be sure to
   restore the Registry.

<P><LI>Reboot the computer

<P><LI>An error appears stating "One or more services failed to load."
   Continue.

<P><LI>Remove or rename the SCSI controller driver that was in the original
<P><PRE>    computer. All drivers are located in the %SYSTEMROOT%\SYSTEM32\DRIVERS
    directory. Removing the old driver will keep the computer from showing
    the "One or more services failed to load" message at boot. You can also
    remove reference to the old driver from the Registry.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Reboot the computer
<P>
</OL>The original computers profile is now restored onto the new computer.
<P>
NOTE: Both example one and two are intended as a guide that will allow
transfer of the Windows NT OS from one similar computer to another.
However, there may be instances that this procedure will not work. If the
new computer has additional hardware that was not present in the original
computer, it may be necessary to install drivers before the additional
hardware will function properly.
