<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
File Transfer Protocol (FTP) clients are allowed to view files and
directories on an NTFS partition, although they have not been given this
right through the file and directory permissions. However, if these clients
try to view the files through a Microsoft network connection, they will
receive the error:
<P>
<PRE>   You do not have permission to access this directory.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
As long as a user has EXECUTE (X) permission on a directory and is a member
of a group that has execute permission, or as long as that user has
explicitly been given the user right to Back up files and directories,
the user will be able to list the files and subdirectories in that
directory. This will occur even if the user has been granted No Access to
files in that directory.
<P>
For example:
<P>
If the user has been given as little access as: Special Access (X)(None),
that user will be able to list the files and subdirectories in that
directory. That user will still, however, get an "access is denied" error
when trying to manipulate the files and subdirectories.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Do not give FTP users the BACK UP FILES AND DIRECTORIES user right, if it
is important that files and subdirectories be hidden through permissions.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51.
We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
