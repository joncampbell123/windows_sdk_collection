<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
A user installed the ATI video driver. The machine didn't have the
correct ATI hardware, so the next time the machine was booted, the ATI
driver failed to load and the plain VGA driver loaded instead. The
user then ran Setup to change to VESA VGA, but Setup didn't disable
the ATI driver because it was not running in the system. As a result,
the next time Windows NT was booted, the following error message
appeared:
<P>
<PRE>   At least one service specified to start at boot has failed to
   start. Please check the event log for details.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The problem is a general one: whenever you change a system component
(display, mouse, keyboard), Setup disables the currently active
component--which may not be the same one that is actually running.
This leaves the original driver enabled, which may cause the above
error message to appear.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 

<OL><P><LI>Open Control Panel, choose the Devices icon, and disable the ATI
   driver.

<P><LI>Run maintenance mode Setup, select the ATI driver again, and exit
   Setup as normal.

<P><LI>Run maintenance mode Setup again, and select the driver you really
   want. When you select another driver, maintenance mode Setup will
   turn off the ATI driver.
<P>
