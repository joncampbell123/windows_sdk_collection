The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
You apply the security fix (SEC-FIX) to a computer running Windows NT 3.51.
Later, you run Performance Monitor from another computer running Windows NT
to monitor the computer running Windows NT 3.51 with SEC-FIX installed.
<P>
When you then select either the Thread or Process object within Performance
Monitor, Performance Monitor quits. You will usually observe that
Performance Monitor simply "goes away" when you select the Thread or
Process object. You do NOT normally see any "Application Error" or "Dr
Watson" dialog boxes when this particular error occurs.
<P>
This problem occurs irrespective of whether the monitoring computer is
running Windows NT 3.51 or 4.0, and irrespective of whether the monitoring
computer has SEC-FIX installed.
<P>
After SEC-FIX has been installed on a computer running Windows NT 3.51, it
can no longer be monitored fully over the network from another computer.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
There is a problem with the Windows NT 3.51 version of this security fix,
which causes incorrect Performance Monitor data to be transferred over the
network when the computer is being monitored remotely. This causes the
monitoring instance of Performance Monitor to try to access memory to which
it has insufficient access.
<P>
The Windows NT 4.0 version of SEC-FIX does not have this problem.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This SEC-FIX hotfix is sometimes referred to as the "Red Button" fix.
<P>
For additional information on the issues addressed by this security fix,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../winnt/q143474.htm">Q143474</A></B>
   TITLE     : Restricting Information Available to Anonymous Logon Users

</PRE><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Obtain the following fix or wait for the next Windows NT service pack.
<P>
This fix should have the following timestamp:
<P>
<PRE>   10/22/97  06:02p               181,504 Advapi32.dll (Intel)
   10/29/97  03:52p               169,504 Winlogon.exe (Intel)

   10/29/97  03:50p               273,168 advapi32.dll (Alpha)
   10/29/97  03:51p               236,304 winlogon.exe (Alpha)

</PRE>NOTE: Service Pack 5 and SEC-FIX must be applied to Windows NT 3.51 prior
to applying this fix.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Windows NT 3.51 version
of the SEC-FIX security fix. A supported fix is now available, but has not
been fully regression tested and should be applied only to systems
experiencing this specific problem. Unless you are severely impacted by
this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next
Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft Technical Support
for more information.
