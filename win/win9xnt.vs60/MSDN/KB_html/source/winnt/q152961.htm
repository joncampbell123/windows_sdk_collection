<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This information in this article is needed to install Microsoft Exchange on
Microsoft Windows NT 4.0.
<P>
Windows NT version 4.0 now ships the TP4 components on the Windows NT
installation compact disc. The files are in the Drvlib directory on the
compact disc.
<P>
<P><h3>Definition of TP4</h3>
 
<P>
OSI transport layer protocol Transport Class 4/Connectionless Network
Protocol (TP4/CLNP) provides an OSI interface across a local area network
(LAN). The Microsoft Exchange Server has an interface that allows it to
work with the Windows NT TP4 driver. It uses this interface to communicate
with other systems using TP4 during message transport. In CLNP, data is
transferred without using a connection request. In Windows NT, TP4 is
designed for use in a connectionless mode network. TP4 network address
information is determined by the server running the transport stack. The
network service access point (NSAP) address used by TP4 is configured in
the Windows NT Control Panel on that server.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To install these files, you must do the following:

<OL><P><LI>If you already have TP4 installed and are upgrading from Windows NT
   3.51, then you must remove and re-install the TP4 components
   from the Windows NT 4.0 compact disc. The version of TP4 that was
   shipped with Windows NT 3.51 will not work on Windows NT 4.0, and the
   Windows NT upgrade process will not upgrade the TP4 components
   automatically.
<P>
   To remove TP4 use the Network applet within the Control Panel.
   Select TP4 from the list of protocols and then select Remove. You
   should re-boot after performing this removal process.

<P><LI>The TP4 files can be found on the compact disc in the following path
   drvlib\protocol\tp4setup. Within this directory path there are
   subdirectories for the processor type of your server.
<P>
   To install the new version of TP4 you should open the network applet
   within the Control Panel. Select the Protocols tab and then the Add
   button. Next select the Have Disk button, and you will get a dialog
   box requesting a path to the installation point. Enter the path to the
   appropriate subdirectory on the Windows NT compact disc for your
   processor type.

<P><LI>You will see a dialog box with the driver ISO TP4/CLNP Stack selected.
   Select the OK button.

<P><LI>You will now be returned to the Network Control Panel applet on the
   Protocols tab. TP4 should now appear on the list of installed protocols.

<P><LI>Select Close to complete the installation process. During the close
   down process, you will be given TP4 configuration options. Select the
   proper Local Address and NSAP address for your configuration and then
   select the OK button.

<P><LI>Re-start the server when requested. Upon re-start the TP4 stack will
   be installed and available for use.
