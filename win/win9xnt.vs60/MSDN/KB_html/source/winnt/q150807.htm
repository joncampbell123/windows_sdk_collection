<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Connecting to network resources using the Universal Naming Convention (UNC)
may take relatively long on a system with more than one network provider
installed. For example, a delay of approximately 30 seconds has been
reported while connecting to a Novell NetWare volume using the UNC on
systems with the Workstation and the Client Services for NetWare network
providers installed.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Multiple UNC Provider (MUP) system component is responsible for
locating the correct network provider for UNC connections. To do so it asks
every network provider installed if it is able to handle a given UNC
connection request. The MUP waits for the result from every network
provider before it decides what network provider should actually handle the
network connection.
<P>
Assume a system that has the Workstation and the Client Services for
NetWare network providers installed. A user or an application issues an UNC
connection request to a network resource located on a NetWare server.
Depending on the number of network protocols installed and the name
resolution methods used, the Workstation network provider will need a
relatively long period of time to find out that it cannot handle the
connection request. Even if the Client Services for NetWare network
provider at once tells the MUP that it can handle the request, the MUP will
wait for the response of the Workstation network provider before it passes
the actual connection request to the Client Services for NetWare network
provider for processing.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To minimize the time it takes to establish an UNC connection, one of the
following steps can be taken:

<UL><LI>Use fewer network providers

<LI>Use fewer network protocols for each network provider installed

<LI>Tune each network protocol used for low name resolution time
