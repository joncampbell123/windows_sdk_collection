<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Windows NT Advanced Server Services for Macintosh easily and inexpensively
allows Macintosh and IBM PC-compatible computers to share files and
printers. Up to 255 Macintosh users can connect to each Windows NT Advanced
Server server, as easily as they can connect to an AppleShare volume. PC
users can connect to the server as well, which provides a mechanism to
transfer files between systems. A Macintosh user can print to a PostScript
printer, and many non-PostScript printers, connected to the Windows NT
Advanced Server server as easily as they can print to a LaserWriter on the
Macintosh network. Furthermore, any PC user can print to a LaserWriter
connected to the Macintosh network.

<P>
<P><h3>Transparent File Sharing</h3>
 
<P>
To a Macintosh user, a Windows NT Advanced Server file server looks just
like an AppleShare server. To a PC user, Windows NT Advanced Server looks
like any PC network server (Windows NT Advanced Server can share a CD-ROM
drive as well). The server intelligently manages file names, icons, and
access permissions for the different networks. For example, each Word for
Windows file appears in the Macintosh environment with the corresponding
Word for Macintosh icon. Windows NT Advanced Server supports launching
Macintosh applications from the file server.
<P>
The Windows NT file system (NTFS) provides multistream file access
that supports storing resource forks and Finder information in the
same file, and supports 31 character filenames, including an
on-the-fly filename translation facility for all client types. These
features increase performance and aid volume management.
<P>
Furthermore, the system administrator can require Macintosh users to
use Windows NT encryption when they log into a server, to provide
enhanced password and network security.
<P>
<P><h3>Inexpensive, High Performance File and Print Server</h3>
 
<P>
Services for Macintosh allow you to convert any computer running Windows NT
Advanced Server, with its built-in networking, to a non-dedicated, high-
performance, AppleShare-compliant file and print server. In other words,
you receive great performance for less than the cost of a comparable
Macintosh computer running AppleShare, and for less cost than that provided
by other PC-based solutions, which require a dedicated machine and
expensive networking software.
<P>
<P><h3>Two-way Printer Sharing</h3>
 
<P>
Services for Macintosh not only gives Macintosh users access to printers on
the Windows NT Advanced Server domain, but it also acts as a print spooler.
This means that Macintosh users can get back to work faster, before their
documents have finished printing, and without using valuable hard-disk
space on their local machine for spooling. Furthermore, a network
administrator can control the print queue for networked LaserWriter
printers just like any other printer attached to a Windows NT Advanced
Server domain.
<P>
Of course, a PC user can also use the same print queues to print to
any LaserWriter connected to the Macintosh network.
<P>
<P><h3>A Printing Miracle</h3>
 
<P>
The best news of all may be that the Services for Macintosh has a built in
PostScript-compatible printing engine. With this engine, a Macintosh can
print to any printer connected to the Windows NT Advanced Server domain as
if it was a LaserWriter. You can finally get great-looking output even from
some of your oldest printers and take advantage of your existing hardware
investment, instead of being forced to upgrade.
<P>
<P><h3>Integrated Administration</h3>
 
<P>
The process of administering and configuring the Services for Macintosh is
tightly integrated into Windows NT Advanced Server. The administrator is
required to manage only one set of users and groups. You can create
Macintosh-accessible volumes directly from File Manager and configure
Services for Macintosh in the Control Panel. The system automatically
translates NTFS file and directory permissions into corresponding Macintosh
permissions.
<P>
Windows NT Advanced Server supports multiple physical network topologies:
TokenRing (TokenTalk), Ethernet (EtherTalk), and "serial" (LocalTalk).
<P>
<P><h3>Easy Upgrade</h3>
 
<P>
Users of LAN Manager Services for Macintosh version 1.0 can smoothly
upgrade to Services for Macintosh version 3.1. The upgrade converts
existing OS/2-based volumes, leaving permissions intact.
<P>
<P><h3>System Requirements</h3>
 
<P>
System 6.0.8 or later (clients)
AFP 2.1-compliant
