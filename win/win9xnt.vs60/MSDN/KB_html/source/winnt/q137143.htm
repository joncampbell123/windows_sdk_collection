The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1

<P>
The WinPopup utility is available in all Windows network client operating
systems such as Windows 95, Windows for Workgroups 3.11, and Windows 3.1
for sending popup messages among computers in the network. However, this
utility is not available and not supported in Windows NT.
<P>
To send popup messages among Windows NT computers and network client
computers, use the NET SEND command from the MS-DOS Command Prompt in
Windows NT as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   net send &lt;computer_name&gt; "&lt;message&gt;"

</PRE>The quotation marks are optional.
<P>
To make sure that Windows for Workgroups or Windows 95 clients can receive
messages sent from Windows NT you need to make sure that WinPopup
functionality is enabled on the client side. To enable WinPopup on Windows
95 clients, please refer to <B><A href="../win95x/q132887.htm">Q132887</A></B>. To enable WinPopup for Windows for
Workgroups clients, go to Control Panel&gt;Network then select the Startup
button and make sure that the "Enable WinPopup" checkbox is selected. Click
OK and then exit the Microsoft Windows Network dialog. Close Control Panel,
then exist and restart Windows.
<P>
Windows NT Workstation and Windows NT Server receive popup messages through
the Messenger Service. You can start the Messenger Service by running
Control Panel and choosing Services. Set the service for Automatic Startup
and start the service.
<P>
Additionally, there are third-party, shareware Windows graphical utilities
that provide a Windows interface for users needing to send messages across
Microsoft networks. These third-party applications can be found on
Compuserve, typically in the WINSHARE forum. Other sources for such
utilities are on the World Wide Web (WWW). You can use WWW search engines
like Yahoo and Lycos to locate Web sites with these Windows utilities.
