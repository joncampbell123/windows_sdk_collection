The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When two RAS servers dial each other with TCP/IP as the protocol, and use
dynamic IP addressing, WINS must be used for them to resolve each other's
NetBIOS names. LMHOSTS or HOSTS file entries will not be sufficient,
because of the dynamic IP addresses.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If server A dials server B, its WAN interface is assigned an IP address by
server B. This IP address will come from the pool that server B provides.
If server B dials server A, its WAN interface will be assigned an IP
address from the pool provided by server A. The IP address associated with
a given WAN interface is not always the same, so static HOSTS or LMHOSTS
files are not adequate for name resolution.
<P>
If both of the RAS servers are using WINS, they will register their names
in their respective WINS databases at startup. When a remote client (in
this case the other RAS server) dials in, it can be assigned an IP address
and a WINS server address, which are the same ones used by the "local" RAS
server. The remote client will then register its name in the WINS database,
and it will also send name queries to the WINS server. Both servers will be
able to resolve each other's names.
<P>
Computers running Microsoft Exchange Server with RAS installed may be set
up to dial each other, and will require the use of WINS as described above,
or the use of another dialup protocol, such as NetBEUI.
<P>
For additional information on using NetBEUI as the dialup protocol between
two Windows NT 4.0 RAS servers, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../winnt/q159352.htm">Q159352</A></B>
   TITLE     : RPC over NetBIOS programs can't call from server to RAS
               client

</PRE>Note: The WINS server itself must NOT be installed on the computer running
Exchange Server if the Exchange server is going to both receive calls and
make calls through the Exchange connector. A WINS server will not register
with another WINS server, nor will it query another WINS server for NetBIOS
resolution. When the computer running Exchange Server with WINS installed
dials out to another computer running Exchange Server, it will not register
with that remote WINS server, and it will not query that WINS server for
NetBIOS names, and will fail to exchange mail.
