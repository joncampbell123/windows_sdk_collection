<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
A primary group is needed when a user logs on using Services for
Macintosh or runs POSIX applications. This group is used as the
default group in Services for Macintosh when assigning permissions. If
there is not a primary group, you will receive the following error
message:
<P>
<PRE>   This operation is not allowed on this special group. ID 2234.

</PRE>This error message is described in the message guide as to occur in
groups such as Users, Administrators and Guests; however, the problem
goes far beyond that.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you delete a global group, Windows NT Advanced Server first
removes all of its members; if one of its members is a Services for
Macintosh user and has that group assigned as his Primary Group, the
Windows NT Advanced Server fails to remove the group and generates the
above error message (ID 2234). (The same thing happens if, when doing
group maintenance, an attempt is made to remove that Macintosh user).
<P>
To successfully delete the group, modify all Services for Macintosh
users that are members of that group, and have it as their Primary
Group, so they have a different Primary Group.
<P>
For each Service for Macintosh user, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>From the User Manager for Domains, double-click the desired user.

<P><LI>Select Groups.

<P><LI>Choose a global group (different than the one you want to delete),
   and then choose Set.

<P><LI>Choose OK.

<P><LI>Choose OK or Close.
<P>
</OL>Even though this operation is time-consuming, using a Primary Group is
recommended because of the lack of flexibility in the Macintosh
permission scheme.
<P>
For more information on how to set Primary Groups for Services for
Macintosh users and what the permission scheme is, see the chapter
titled "How Services for Macintosh Works" in the Windows NT Advanced
Server "Services for Macintosh" guide.
