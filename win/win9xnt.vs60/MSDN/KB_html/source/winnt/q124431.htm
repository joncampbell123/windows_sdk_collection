The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you install Windows NT 3.5 over Windows NT 3.1, SNMP traps are not
received by your network agent. If you have access to a network monitor
or sniffer, you can see the traps being sent to the wrong port.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Under Windows NT 3.1, builds 511 and 528, the entry in the SERVICES file
for SNMP-TRAP was set (incorrectly) to port 167. The SERVICES file under
Windows NT 3.5 has the entry for SNMP-TRAP correctly set to port 162. The
SERVICES file is copied only if the file does not already exist when you
upgrade to Windows NT 3.5. Since it exists from the Windows NT 3.1
installation, the new SERVICES file with the corrected port number is not
copied.
<P>
This was not a problem under Windows NT 3.1 is because SNMP did not look in
the SERVICES file to determine which port to use. The SNMP that ships with
Windows 3.5 does look in the SERVICES file to determine which port to use
for sending SNMP traps.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Edit the SERVICES file in the %SYSTEMROOT%\SYSTEM32\DRIVERS\ETC directory
and change the SNMP-TRAP entry from
<P>
<PRE>   snmp-trap         167/udp    snmp

to:

   snmp-trap         162/udp    snmp

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. We
are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
