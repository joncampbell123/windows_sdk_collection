The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system versions 3.51 and 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51 and 4.0
</UL>

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
A Winsock application may appear to have stopped responding or it may not
be able to send or receive data. All other services and applications,
including other Winsock applications, continue to function without
problems.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
On systems running multiple Winsock applications that request the same
specific port, repeated requests for a Winsock port that was in the process
of being opened could result in two or more of the processes being assigned
the port. The last process assigned would continue to function normally,
while the other processes would fail to send or receive data over the port.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
An updated version of Afd.sys has been created to correct the problem.
After applying the fix, the system must be restarted before the change will
take effect.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.51
and 4.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Windows NT 4.0
U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on
