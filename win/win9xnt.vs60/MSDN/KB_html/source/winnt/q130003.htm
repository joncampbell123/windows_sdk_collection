<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Excessive network traffic is generated after your losing contact with
shared resources on computers running Windows NT Workstation. For example,
client A shares a CD-ROM drive and client B connects to the share. Client A
then runs File Manager and removes the share without notifying client B or
logging off. Client B is still connected and performing work. As a result,
a series of directly addressable frames between the two machines try to
figure out what happened. Approximately 14 minutes later, Client B receives
the message that the network drive can no longer be found. No error message
is recorded in the event log.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The problem appears to be caused by the Windows NT redirector, which is not
handling invalid Tree ID messages properly in some circumstances. This
problem usually occurs when you use File Manager, but can occur with other
32-bit Windows-based applications, depending on how they are calling the
WNet APIs. This problem does not seem to occur when you use a command line
utility.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. A
fix to this problem is in development, but has not been regression-tested
and may be destabilizing in production environments. Microsoft does not
recommend implementing this fix at this time. Contact Microsoft Product
Support Services for more information on the availability of this fix.
