<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you are upgrading a computer to Windows NT 4.0, you may receive the
following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   The procedure entry point NTDiskeeper could not be located in the
   dynamic link library Ntdll.dll.

</PRE>This error can be generated by either the Dkfat.exe or Dkntfs.exe module,
and can occur even if the services are stopped before you begin the
upgrade process.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior can occur if you are upgrading a computer on which DisKeeper
1.1 by Executive Software is installed. DisKeeper 1.1 replaces the Windows
NT kernel with a modified version.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this behavior, uninstall DisKeeper 1.1 before you upgrade
the computer to Windows NT 4.0.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Executive Software has announced an updated version of DisKeeper that is
designed for Windows NT 4.0. For additional information, please contact
Executive Software.
