The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51
<LI>Microsoft File and Print Services for NetWare version 3.51
</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
You can manager File and Print Services for NetWare (FPNW) users remotely
from a Windows NT Workstation or Windows NT Server (member server) using
User Manager for Domains.
<P>
You cannot manage FPNW users remotely from a Windows for Workgroups
computer using the 16-bit Windows NT Server Tools.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
NOTE: User Manager for Domains (USRMGR.EXE), which is included with the
Windows NT Resource Kit, does not support File and Print Services for
Netware user options. If FPNW user configuration options are required,
please follow the procedures listed below for Windows NT Workstation or
Windows NT Server (member server).
<P>
<P><h3>Configuring Windows NT Member Server To Remotely Manage FPNW Users</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Make sure that your Windows NT member server is part of a domain
   (instead of the administrator logging on to the local computer account).
   For additional information, please see the following article in the
   Microsoft Knowledge Base:

<PRE></PRE>      TITLE     : FPNW Options Are Not Available Under User Manager

</PRE><P><LI>Verify that Windows NT 3.51 Service Pack 3 (SP3) or greater is installed
   on your system. To do this, select About Program Manager from the Help
   menu in Program Manager. To obtain the latest Windows NT Service Pack,
   please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

</PRE><P><LI>Log on to the domain as Administrator or Administrator-equivalent user
   and run User Manager for Domains from the Administrative Tools group.

<P><LI>Insert the FPNW compact disk in the CD-ROM drive or connect to the share
   where the software is located. In Control Panel Network, click Add
   Software. Select the "&lt;Other&gt; Requires disk from manufacturer" option.
   Type the path to the FPNW software for the type of processor you are
   installing (for example, if you install FPNW from an Intel-based
   computer and the network share of drive H:, type: "H:\I386\" (without
   quotes). Select the FPNW Administrative Tools and click OK. The files
   are copied over to your system. Once complete, click OK in the Network
   Settings dialog box. Restart the computer.

<P><LI>After you restart Windows NT, run User Manager for Domains from the
   Administrative Tools group. After you select a user, view the user's
   properties. A NW Compatible button should now appear. Click this button
   to configure FPNW users.

   network share, where this software is located. Start SETUP.BAT in the
   \CLIENTS\SRVTOOLS\WINNT directory on the Windows NT Server 3.51 compact
   disc. Setup copies all the Windows NT Server Tools to your
   %SystemRoot%\System32 directory. Program items are not created for these
   tools. Therefore, create program items for the following files:

      SRVMGR.EXE (Server Manager)
      UPEDIT.EXE (User Profile Editor)
