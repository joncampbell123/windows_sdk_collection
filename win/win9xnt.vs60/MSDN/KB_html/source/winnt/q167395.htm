The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Routes may appear in the route table as having a metric of 16. A Routing
Information Protocol (RIP) route with a metric of 16 is defined as
"unreachable." This can cause difficulties with connectivity to remote
resources or can cause connections to use another router.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
There is a problem in Iprip.dll that causes route entries to expire, thus
causing routes to time out early. Additionally, for very low values of
RouteTimeOut, it may still be necessary to make a registry change to
prevent early route expiration, as described here.
<P>
For more information on RouteTimeOut, please see the following article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../winnt/q169161.htm">Q169161</A></B>
   TITLE     : Registry Parameters for RIP for IP version 1

</PRE><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this problem, obtain the following fix or wait for the next
Windows NT service pack.
<P>
This fix should have the following time stamp:
<P>
<PRE>   12/03/97  04:17p     53,520 Iprip.dll (Alpha)
   12/03/97  04:20p     34,576 Iprip.dll (Intel)

</PRE>After applying the hotfix, if you have modified the RouteTimeOut registry
value to time out routes in less than the default value of 180 seconds, it
may be necessary to adjust the granularity of the timeout routine. This can
be accomplished with the new MaxTimedOpsInterval registry parameter, as
follows:
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor
can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

<OL><P><LI>Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

<P><LI>Go to the following subkey in the registry:
<P>
<P><PRE>      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Iprip
      \Parameters\MaxTimedOpsInterval
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for
   readability.

<P><LI>Click Edit, click Add Value and then enter the following information:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Parameter Type: REG_DWORD
<PRE></PRE>      Default:        10 (seconds)
      Range:          1-0xffffffff
      Description:    This registry value sets the maximum amount of time
                      allowed between invocations of the routine that
                      performs route maintenance. In effect, it controls
                      the granularity of the amount of time that can be
                      decremented from each route's expiration time. It
                      should be set to a value less than the difference
                      between RouteTimeOut and the RIP announcement
                      interval. Microsoft does not recommend setting the
                      parameter to any value greater than the default of 10
                      seconds.

</PRE><P><LI>Exit Registry Editor.
<P>
</OL>For example, if you set the RouteTimeOut value to its minimum of 20 seconds
and your router(s) sends RIP announcements every 15 seconds, this value
should be set to 4 seconds or less.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0.
A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested
and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem.
Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix.
Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
