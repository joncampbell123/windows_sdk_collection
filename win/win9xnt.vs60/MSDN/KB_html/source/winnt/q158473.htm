<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When upgrading a Windows NT Server version 3.51 (or earlier) release to
Windows NT 4.0, the DHCP database must be converted to the new database
format. This conversion is required because the services now use an
improved database engine that is faster and compacts automatically to
prevent fragmentation and consequent growth of the database. The database
conversion procedure happens automatically as part of an upgrade
installation.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When the DHCP service first starts after an upgrade to Windows NT 4.0, it
detects that the database needs to be converted. It then starts a
conversion process, Jetconv.exe. (If Jetconv.exe has already been started
by another service, a second Jetconv.exe process is not started.) Prior to
conversion, the user is notified that the conversion process is about to
start and is asked for confirmation. If the user clicks OK, the DHCP
service quits and the conversion begins. Jetconv.exe converts the
databases of all the installed services (DHCP and, if installed, WINS and
RPL) to the new Windows NT 4.0 database format.
<P>
After the DHCP database is converted successfully, the DHCP server service
automatically restarts.
<P>
Before starting the conversion process, note the following guidelines:

<UL><LI>Prior to upgrading to Windows NT Server 4.0, bring the Windows NT 3.51
   databases for the DHCP server to a consistent state. Do this by
   stopping the services from Control Panel\Services or by using the
   net stop service command.

<LI>The conversion requires approximately the same amount of free diskspace
   as the size of the original database and log files. You should have at
   least 5 MB free for the log files for each database.

<LI>The conversion process preserves the original database and log files in
   a subdirectory named 351db under the same directory where the original
   database and log files were located. On the DHCP server, this is the
   %SystemRoot%\System32\Dhcp\351db\ directory.
<P>
</UL>The services must not be restarted while the databases are being
converted. To check the status of the conversion, the user should watch
the Application Event Log of the Jetconv.exe process by using Event
Viewer.
<P>
In cases where this automatic procedure of converting databases fails, the
database can be converted manually using winntdir\system32\upg351db.exe.
For instructions, type the following at the command prompt:
<P>
<PRE>   upg351db -?

</PRE>Note the following information:

<UL><LI>You cannot convert the new database back to the previous database
   format.

<LI>The converted database will not work with Windows NT 3.51 or earlier
   services.

<LI>The new database engine uses log files named by using the prefix J50.
