<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After installing Service Pack 5 (SP5) for Windows NT version 3.51 or
Service Pack 2 (SP2) or 3 (SP3) for Windows NT version 4.0, you may receive
one of the following error messages:

<UL><LI>There was an error writing to the IP address.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Unexpected Network Error
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when a line printer remote (LPR) printing device does
not respond for 15 minutes. A debug timer is being set for 15 minutes of no
connection to the printer.
<P>
An LPR printing device may stop responding if the printer is out of paper
or if it is taken offline.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem and resume printing, clear the dialog box at
the server.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0.
A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested
and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem.
Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix.
Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
