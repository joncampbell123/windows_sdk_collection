<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Windows NT version 3.1 currently supports the Adaptec 2740 and
2742 SCSI adapters in Adaptec's 274x adapter series. Support for Adaptec
models 2740W, 2742W, 2740T, 2742T, 2740A, 2742A, 2740A-W, 2742A-W, 2740A-T,
and 2742A-T is provided by obtaining a driver from Adaptec.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Adaptec 274x SCSI adapters are 32-bit EISA adapters using the AIC 7770 RISC
chip. They support multitasking, multi-input/output, and tag queuing.
<P>
As with most Adaptec models, a model number ending in 2 (such as the 2742)
indicates support for floppy disk drives, while models ending in 0 (such as
the 2740) do not support floppy disk drives.
<P>
Some models end with letters. The following explains what the letters
indicate:
<P>
W - Wide SCSI. These models support 16 megabytes (MB) data transfer and are
<PRE>   generally used for hard disk drives designed for this transfer speed.
   Only SCSI devices that support wide SCSI can take advantage of the
   higher data transfer rate. The external connector on this card is a 68-
   pin P connector. Other than the additional pins, it looks similar to a
   SCSI-2 connector.

</PRE>T - Twin Channel. These adapters support 14 SCSI devices - either 7
<PRE>   external and 7 internal devices, or 14 internal devices.

</PRE>A - Indicates that this model is based on the AIC-7770 revision E RISC
<PRE>   processor. Models without the "A" are based on the AIC-7770 revision C
   RISC processor.

</PRE>According to Adaptec product support, their version of ARROW.SYS does
support models 2740W, 2742W, 2740T, 2742T, 2740A, 2742A, 2740A-W, 2742A-W,
2740A-T, 2742A-T. This driver can be obtained by downloading the file
2X4XWNT.ZIP from the Adaptec BBS at (408) 945-7727. All support for the
Adaptec driver is provided by Adaptec. You can call Adaptec Technical
Support at (408) 945-2550.
