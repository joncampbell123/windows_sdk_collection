The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system, version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0

<P>
Windows NT supports most removable hard disks and magnetic-optical
disk drives. These disks are treated as hard disks because they must
be partitioned and they are assigned a drive letter. However, Windows
NT does not support write-once disk drives.
<P>
Windows NT supports removable media subject to the following
restrictions:

<UL><LI>A removable hard disk can have only one primary partition. Extended
   or logical partitions are not supported.

<LI>Windows NT supports only the Windows NT filesystem (NTFS) and
   MS-DOS-compatible (FAT) file system on removable media.

<LI>The user cannot assign the drive letter for the device.

<LI>Removable disks are not supported in a fault tolerant manner.

<LI>You can install the Windows NT system files (the files contained in the
   WINNT directory) on a removable disk. However, the NT boot files, such
   as NTLDR and NTDETECT.COM, must be on the hard disk drive (fixed disk).

<LI>If the paging file is located on the device or if the device has
   the NTFS installed, the media is locked until the system is
   shutdown.

<LI>The FAT file system locks the media while it is in use and unlocks
   it after approximately 10 seconds of inactivity.
<P>
<P><PRE>      NOTE: Windows NT supports a 20.8MB "floptical" disk as a floppy
      disk, not as a hard disk. Each write to a floppy disk is
      performed on a write-through cache basis and you can remove a
      floppy disk as long as the drive light is not on.
