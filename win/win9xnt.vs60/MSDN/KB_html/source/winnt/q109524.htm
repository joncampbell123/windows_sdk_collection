<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Windows NT, if you check your hard disk drive with CHKDSK in Read Only
mode and it has files currently open or in use by Windows NT, one of the
following error messages may appear:
<P>
<PRE>   CHKDSK detected minor inconsistencies on the drive.

</PRE>-or-
<P>
<PRE>   Errors found, F parameter not specified
   Corrections will not be written to disk.
   \WINNT\SYSTEM32\RAS\DEVICE.LOG entry has a bad size

</PRE>This message does not indicate that the drive or the sectors are defective.
CHKDSK cannot check the validity of the files that are open by Windows NT.
Therefore, CHKDSK reports that it has detected minor inconsistencies.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
In the above error message, "minor inconsistencies" refers to a state where
redundant information stored in different places is "out of synch." This is
a natural and expected condition whenever there are open files on the
volume that have undergone modification. The redundant information is not
brought into synchronization until the files are closed. Typically, this
error message occurs when CHKDSK is run against the volume containing
Windows NT system files (including active user profiles and the pagefile).
If you also receive a message indicating that CHKDSK /f cannot run because
the volume is in use by another process, that is a confirmation that there
are open files on the volume.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
You can usually safely ignore this error message even if the message
appears without there being open files, because it is only the redundant
information that is out of synchronization. The only side effect you may
see as a result of this message is an incorrect reading of free disk space
or something similar.
