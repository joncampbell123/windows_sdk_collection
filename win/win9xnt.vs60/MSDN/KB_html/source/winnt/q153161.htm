The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
A RAS service configured to use dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP)
to allocate IP addresses for dial-up clients may acquire more IP address
leases than needed, thereby depleting available addresses.
<P>
The leased addresses are indicated by a telephone icon in the Active Leases
window of DHCP Manager.
<P>
This problem can occur when laptop users on the network who have installed
RAS and configured it for dialing out and receiving calls start their
systems on and off the network.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
During initialization, the RAS service acquires new leases because it fails
to read information regarding previously acquired leases. The previously
leased addresses, now orphaned, will only be returned to the pool of
available addresses when their leases expire.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Obtain the following fix or wait for the next Windows NT service pack.
<P>
This fix should have the following timestamp:
<P>
<PRE>   12/05/97  03:14p                28,432 Rasiphlp.dll (i386 platform)

   12/05/97  03:12p                46,864 Rasiphlp.dll (Alpha platform)

</PRE>NOTE: Service Pack 3 must be applied to Windows NT 4.0 prior to applying
this fix.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0.
A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested
and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem.
Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix.
Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
