<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Client licenses are assigned on a first come first serve basis in the
licensing service. There is no way to assign client licenses to specific
users or to assign licenses on a departmental basis in this version of the
licensing service. This poses no problem in the current Per Seat Mode but
may cause confusion in the Per Server mode since there is connection
enforcement in this mode.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Because licenses are assigned on a first come first serve basis and
enforcement takes place in Per Server mode, legitimate users may be refused
a connection. Connection denial can also be caused when a server has
reached its connection limit and an administrator connects to the server.
Although the server is over its licensed connection limit, the
administrator is still allowed to connect. Then, when a user's session is
dropped, they can not reconnect because the server's connection limit is
exceeded. In this circumstance, the following error message appears:
<P>
<PRE>   Error 71 - session limit exceeded

</PRE>NOTE: Multiple administrators may connect after the server's connection
limit is exceeded: administrators are not denied access to the server
at any time.
