The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51 and 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51 and 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them.
Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of
Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
As a part of Windows NT security, machine account passwords are changed
every seven days. This article describes how an administrator can disable
automatic machine account password changes.
<P>
WARNING: By disabling machine account password changes, you are giving up
some security because the secure channel is used for pass-through
authentication. If someone discovers a password, he or she could
potentially perform pass-through authentication to the domain controller.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
You may want to disable weekly machine account password changes for any of
the following reasons:

<UL><LI>You want to reduce replication occurrences. As a side effect of
   automatic machine account password changes, a domain with a large
   number of computers and domain controllers could cause replication to
   occur on a frequent basis. Disabling automatic machine account password
   changes reduces replication occurrences.

<LI>You have two separate installations of Windows NT on the same computer
   in a dual-boot configuration. In this case, the only way to share the
   same machine account between the two installations of Windows NT is to
   use the default machine account password created when you join the
   domain.

<LI>If you perform a clean installation of Windows NT often, you need an
   administrator on the domain who can create the machine account on the
   domain. If that is a problem, you can simply leave the password of the
   machine account as the default.
<P>
</UL>In Windows NT versions 3.51 and later,  you can disable weekly machine
account password changes on a workstation by setting the registry entry
DisablePasswordChange to 1 in the following registry key:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Netlogon\
   Parameters

</PRE>In Windows NT version 4.0, you can disable the machine account password
change by setting the registry entry RefusePasswordChange to 1 in the
following registry key on all domain controllers in the domain rather than
on all workstations:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Netlogon\
   Parameters

</PRE>NOTE: This change refuses password change requests only from Windows NT
workstations (or Windows NT Member Servers) running Windows NT version 4.0
or later.
<P>
NOTE: After the first attempt to change the password, setting
RefusePasswordChange to 1 prevents the workstation from further attempts
to change the password (by returning a distinct status code), but the
workstation will try again in one week. Setting RefusePasswordChange to 1
stops the replication traffic, but not the client traffic. Setting
DisablePasswordChange to 1 stops both client and replication traffic.
<P>
By disabling automatic machine account password changes, you can set up
two (or more) installations of Windows NT on the same computer using the
same machine account. To do this, use the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Install Windows NT, and set up the computer as a workgroup member.

<P><LI>Disable the automatic machine account password changes by changing the
   registry key listed above.

<P><LI>Restart the computer.

<P><LI>Set up the machine account on the domain controller using Server
   Manager.

<P><LI>Join the domain using the Network tool in Control Panel.

<P><LI>Perform a second installation of Windows NT in a separate directory,
   and set up the computer as a workgroup member.

<P><LI>Repeat steps 2-3.
<P></OL>
