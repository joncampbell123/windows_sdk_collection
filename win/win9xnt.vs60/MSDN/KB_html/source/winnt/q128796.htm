The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5
</UL>

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When After Dark version 2.0 loads in Windows NT and you attempt to start an
application that uses a device connected to a serial communication (COM)
port, the following error message appears:
<P>
<PRE>   The selected COM port is either not supported or is being
   used by another device.

   Select another port.

</PRE>If you select another port, the same error message appears again.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when After Dark 2.0 SystemIQ Activity Monitor runs
before you start the application using the COM ports.
<P>
SystemIQ Activity Monitor monitors serial and parallel port activity as
well as CPU load. As activity of the CPU or external devices increases,
After Dark does not blank out the screen to provide maximum processing time
to other tasks.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem:

<OL><P><LI>Run the After Dark Control program and choose Setup.

<P><LI>Clear the SystemIQ Activity Monitor check box.

<P><LI>Using a text editor, open the AD_PREFS.INI file. This file is located at
   the Windows NT %SystemRoot% directory.

<P><LI>In the [After Dark] section of AD_PREFS.INI, change
   "WatchComPorts=1,2,3,4" to ";WatchComPorts=1,2,3,4" (without the
   quotation marks).
<P>
   NOTE: If one specific COM port is used by the COM device continuously,
   such as Terminal or Remote Access Service), remove only the port number.
   You do not have to remark out (;) the entire line.

<P><LI>If you experience problems with the parallel ports, change the
   "WatchParallelPorts=1,2,3" entry in the [After Dark] section of
   AD_PREFS.INI file to ";WatchParallelPorts=1,2,3" (without the quotation
   marks).
<P>
   NOTE: If one specific parallel port is used by a parallel device
   continuously, remove only the port number. You do not have to remark
   out (;) the entire line. The problem with parallel ports does not cause
   the message above to appear.
