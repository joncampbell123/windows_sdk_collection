<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5x
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5x
</UL>

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
An attempt to connect using the FTP service from a remote workstation
to a Windows NT or Windows NT Advanced Server as "Anonymous" fails and
the client receives the following message:
<P>
<PRE>   530 Anonymous cannot login
   Login failed.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when the Anonymous login connection is not configured
correctly on the FTP host workstation, or the Guest account has been
disabled.
<P>
The Windows NT Server service supports "Anonymous Connections" which allow
a remote client to establish an FTP session without its password being
visible through the physical network line or in the FTP server utility. The
Windows NT implementation of the FTP Server service maps the Anonymous
login to the Guest account user name and password stored in the security
database on the host workstation.
<P>
NOTE: The account you use for anonymous connections must reside in the
local security database on the host machine, or the host's domain security
database. It cannot reside in an account on a trusted domain.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To support Anonymous Connections to the FTP server, match the Anonymous
user name and password to that of the Guest account of the Windows NT FTP
host computer.
<P>
To verify that Anonymous connections are configured correctly, perform
the following five steps:

<OL><P><LI>Start Windows NT Control Panel.

<P><LI>If the FTP Server is already installed on the workstation choose Network
   from the Settings menu, then choose FTP Server and choose Configure.

<P><LI>Verify that the "Allow Anonymous Connections" option is enabled.

<P><LI>Verify that the user name is specified as "guest".

<P><LI>Verify that the password matches that for the Guest account as defined
   in the User Manager.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: The default guest account password is null (blank) in both the guest
account and for the Anonymous FTP account.
<P>
If the Guest account has been disabled, re-enable it by starting User
Manager in the Administrative Tools group, open the Guest account, clear
the Account Disabled check box, and then choose OK.
