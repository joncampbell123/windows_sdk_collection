<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When two different Windows NT Advanced Servers or Windows NT Servers in a
domain think they are the Primary Domain Controller (PDC), the following
error message may appear in the Event Log:
<P>
<PRE>   A domain controller is already running in this domain.

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
It may be necessary to promote a Backup Domain Controller (BDC) to PDC
when the original PDC fails. In the event that the original PDC is
unavailable during this process, it is necessary to promote the BDC
without having the PDC on-line. This should only be done when the PDC is
expected to be down for a long period of time because demotion of the
original PDC to BDC will not occur. The following message occurs in Server
Manager during promotion of a BDC to PDC when the original PDC is
unavailable:
<P>
<PRE>   Cannot find the Primary DC for Domain xxxxxx.

</PRE>You can administer this domain, but certain domain-wide operations are
disabled. Promoting the BDC to PDC should work properly at this point.
When the original PDC is restarted, it attempts to also become the PDC, and
two Windows NT Advanced Server computers will both think they are PDCs for
the same domain. As a result, the NetLogon service fails on the original
PDC because a PDC already exists in the domain. Server Manager shows two
PDCs for the domain. The original PDC has a transparent icon representing a
domain controller while the current PDC has the correct colored domain
controller icon.
<P>
To demote one of the PDCs:

<OL><P><LI>Stop the NetLogon service on the current PDC by typing:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Net Stop NetLogon
</PRE>
<P><LI>Highlight the machine name of the original PDC and then select Demote
   To Server from the Computer menu. This changes the role of the original
   PDC to BDC.

<P><LI>Restart the NetLogon server by typing:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Net Start NetLogon
</PRE><P>
</OL>The original PDC can be promoted to PDC in step 2, if you want. The
current PDC needs to be demoted to a server immediately after this step.
