<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The default settings for the mouse have acceleration enabled. To disable
acceleration in the Mouse Control Panel tool, you can move the Mouse
Speed slide bar all the way to the left. However, this makes the mouse
pointer move very slowly in relation to the movement of the mouse.
Disabling acceleration is desirable for some users of Windows NT, such as
CAD users, but making the default mouse speed the only speed is
impractical.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To calculate the mouse speed under Windows NT, three settings are used:
Mouse Speed, MouseThreshold1, and MouseThreshold2.
<P>
Mouse Speed sets the relationship between mouse and cursor movement when
the value of either MouseThreshold1 or MouseThreshold2 is exceeded. When
this occurs, cursor movement accelerates according to the value of
MouseSpeed.
<P>
MouseThreshold1 and MouseThreshold2 set the maximum number of pixels the
mouse can move between mouse interrupts before the system alters the
relationship between mouse and cursor movement. If the mouse movement
exceeds the threshold defined by MouseThreshold1 and if MouseSpeed is
greater than 0, the system moves the cursor at twice the normal speed. If
the mouse movement exceeds the threshold defined by MouseThreshold2 and if
MouseSpeed is 2, the system moves the cursor at four times the normal
speed.
<P>
Using the slide bar in the Mouse Control Panel tool, you cannot disable
acceleration without making the mouse pointer respond very slowly to the
mouse movements. It is possible to overcome this limitation by manually
setting the MouseThreshold settings so low that any movement at all is
accelerated. Mouse pointer speed will no longer increase factorially with
an increase in mouse movement, but still moves at a rate higher than
normal.
<P>
<PRE>   WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-
   wide problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct
   them. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the
   use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

</PRE>To implement a higher default mouse pointer speed for the currently logged
in user, use the Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe) to edit the following
registry key:
<P>
<PRE>    HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Mouse

</PRE><P><LI>Set the value of MouseThreshold1 to 0.

<P><LI>Set the value of MouseThreshold2 to 0.

<P><LI>Set the value of MouseSpeed to 1 or 2 (1 doubles the normal speed, 2
   quadruples the normal speed).

<P><LI>Close Registry Editor, close all applications, and restart Windows NT.
