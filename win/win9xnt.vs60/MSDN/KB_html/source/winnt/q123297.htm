<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Windows NT version 3.1 may lose connections with Hewlett-Packard (HP)
JetDirect printers. This can result in a continuous Online or Status
Unknown for the printer in Print Manager. The print queue then stops
responding (hangs) and does not restart until the server is restarted.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To correct this problem, do the following:

<UL><LI>Make sure the latest version of HPMON.DLL is loaded. Run Print Manager.
   Select any print queue using an HP JetDirect. From the Printer menu,
   choose Properties, and then choose Settings. Choose the About button to
   display the version information. It should be version A.00.14.
<P>
   NOTE: This is the version shipping with Windows NT version 3.5 and is
   available for Windows NT version 3.1 in Service Pack 3 or the HPMON.DLL
   provided in the HPMON.EXE Application Note, which is located in
   Microsoft Download Library (MSDL) and the Internet on FTP.MICROSOFT.COM.

<LI>Increase the DLC Timers settings located in Print Manager to be similar
   to the version information above. To adjust the DLC Timers, select a
   printer using a JetDirect, and then choose Properties from the Printer
   menu. Choose the Settings button, and then choose Options (do this from
   the server because HPMON.DLL cannot run remotely). The range for each of
   the three settings of the DLC Timers is 1 to 10. Try doubling each
   setting first, and then adjust them more if you need to. This affects
   HPMON as a whole for the server, so you only need to make this
   adjustment on one printer. Note: the new settings will not take affect
   until you restart the server.

<LI>HPMON by default uses windowing to communicate with the JetDirect card.
   This means HPMON will send say five packets to the JetDirect and only
   expect one acknowledgment for all five. Sometimes if the printer is slow
   to accept incoming data, the buffers on the JetDirect will become full
   and the JetDirect cannot accept all of the packets at once. The
   JetDirect will not send the acknowledgment and HPMON must attempt to
   synchronize between the two. Under stress, this causes problems because
   traffic increases between HPMON and the JetDirect with retransmissions.
   The connection may fail during this time. In cases like this, it is best
   to turn the windowing off. By doing so, HPMON will send one packet and
   wait for an acknowledgment before sending the second packet. This
   provides for much better error handling. While this change does affect
   the network speed to the printer, the speed is only moderately affected
   and is still much faster than printers can render the print. The above
   cases of flow control can actually be faster then with the
   retransmissions of failed windows of data.
<P>
   To disable windowing, you may modify the Registry. However, if you
   extract the new HPMON available on MSDL and the Internet with the "-D"
   (without the quotation marks) parameter, and then run the automated
   Install program for HPMON, you do not have to modify the Registry.
<P>
   WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-
<P><PRE>      wide problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct
      them. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the
      use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.
</PRE><P>
   1. Start REGEDT32.EXE and locate the following Registry subkey:
<P>
<P><PRE>      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control
<PRE></PRE>         \Print\Monitors\Hewlett-Packard Network Port\Options

   2. From the Edit menu, choose Add Value. Enter "MaximumXmitsWindow"
      (without the quotation marks) in the Value Name field. Select
      REG_DWORD for the Data Type. Enter 1 in the Data field and choose OK.

   3. Exit REGEDT32.
