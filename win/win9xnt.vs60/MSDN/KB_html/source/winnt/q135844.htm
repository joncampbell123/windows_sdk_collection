The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5 and 3.51
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
You run WINS Manager, choose Mappings, choose Show Database, and choose
WINS Servers. After you delete an entry from the Select Owner List it
reappears, even though the WINS Server it defines is no longer involved in
WINS replication.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when two or more WINS servers on your network are set
up as Push/Pull partners, and one of them is removed.
<P>
The replicated database does not get removed from a WINS server when
that databases owner is removed from the replication partnership. The
Push/Pull relationship keeps the entry active, even though it has
been deleted on one computer.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem use the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>On each computer: Stop Push/Pull Replication between all partners.

<P><LI>Using the Delete Owner option in the Show Database dialog, remove the
   WINS Servers that are no longer present on the network from each WINS
   Server.

<P><LI>Re-start Push/Pull Replication between all partners.
<P></OL>
