The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51 and 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information on how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" online Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry
Key" online Help topic in Regedt32.exe.
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use Microsoft Windows 95 Dial-up Networking to access a remote
network via a RAS member server that has been configured to use only the
IPX/SPX protocol, you may receive the following error message when the
remote Windows NT domain controller attempts to send back a logon response
through the RAS member server:
<P>
<PRE>   There is no domain controller available

</PRE>After receiving the error message, the dial-up client may still have access
to the remote network (without authentication), and may be able to
access some resources on the domain.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The RAS member server cannot authenticate logon attempts, so it forwards
the NetBIOS broadcast (type 20 packets) to the domain controller on the
local area network (LAN). The domain controller tries to respond with a
type 20 broadcast back through the RAS gateway to the client. By default,
the RAS member server will not forward type 20 Packets (14h) back to the
client unless two-way broadcasting of type 20 packets (NetBIOS over IPX) is
enabled on the RAS member server.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To enable two-way broadcasting of NetBIOS over IPX through a RAS gateway,
change the data value in the registry on the RAS server.
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall Windows 95. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved.
Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the Changing Keys and
Values online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Note that you
should make a backup copy of the registry files (System.dat and User.dat)
before you edit the registry.

<OL><P><LI>Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe), then locate the following registry
   subkey in the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree:
<P>
<P><PRE>      \System\CurrentControlSet\Services\NwlnkRip\Parameters
</PRE>
<P><LI>Select the value NetBiosRouting.

<P><LI>On the Edit menu, click DWORD.

<P><LI>Change the data value from 2 to 6. The following is a list of the data
   values you can use for NetBiosRouting:
<P>
<P><PRE>      0 = Do not forward broadcasts. (This is the default, to reduce
      network traffic.)
      
      2 = Forward NetBIOS packets from the remote client to the LAN.
      
      4 = Forward NetBIOS packets from the LAN to the remote client.
      
      6 = Forward NetBIOS packets both ways between remote clients and the
      LAN.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Click OK, and then quit Registry Editor.

<P><LI>Shut down and restart Windows NT Server.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: Forwarding 14h packets significantly increases network and RAS
traffic. It is more efficient to enable the NetBEUI protocol over the RAS
connection (RAS Server + PDC) than to enable two-way broadcasting of type
20 (14h) packets.
