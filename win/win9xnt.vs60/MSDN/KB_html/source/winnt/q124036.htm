<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article defines Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) and discusses its Dial
Up sequence implemented with the Windows NT Server version 3.5 Remote
Access Service (RAS).
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>What is PPP?</h3>
 
<P>
The Point-to-Point Protocol is a set of industry standard protocols that
enable remote access solutions to interoperate in a multi-vendor network.
PPP support in Windows NT version 3.5 ensures that Windows workstations
can
dial up to remote networks through any industry standard PPP remote access
server. It also enables Windows NT Server to receive calls from, and
provide network access to other vendors' remote access workstation
software. PPP support for TCP/IP, IPX, and NetBEUI makes Windows NT
version
3.5 an "Internet-ready" and ideal mobile computing operating system for
networks ranging from small workgroups to large enterprises.
<P>
<P><h3>PPP Dial-Up Sequence</h3>
 
<P>
The dial up sequence for PPP involve the following:

<OL><P><LI>Negotiate Link Control Protocols (LCP). LCP is used to establish and
   configure link and framing parameters such as maximum frame size. For
   additional information, refer to the PPP Framing section below.

<P><LI>Negotiate Authentication Protocols. Authentication protocols are used
</OL>to
<PRE>   determine what level security validation the remote access server can
   perform, and what the server requires. The level of security that can
</PRE></OL>be
<PRE>   negotiated ranges from clear text password authentication to encrypted
   authentication to callback security. For more information on each type
   of authentication protocol, refer to the Authentication Protocols
   section below.

</PRE><P><LI>Negotiate Network Control Protocols (NCP). NCPs are used to establish
   and configure different network protocol parameters, such as IP, IPX
</OL>and
<PRE>   NBF. This includes negotiating protocol header compression and
   compression control protocol. For more information on each type of
</PRE></OL>NCPs,
<PRE>   refer to the Network Control Protocols section below.

</PRE>After the above negotiations, the resulting connection remains active
until
the line is disconnected due to any of the following reasons:

<UL><LI>User explicitly hangs up the line
<LI>Line drops due to idle time-out
<LI>Administrator hangs up the line or
<LI>An unrecoverable link error occurs
<P>
</UL><h3>PPP Framing</h3>
 
<P>
PPP framing defines how data is encapsulated before transmission on the
wide area network (WAN). By providing a standard framing format, PPP
ensures that various vendors' remote access solutions can communicate and
recognize data packets from each other. PPP uses HDLC framing for serial,
ISDN and X.25 data transfers.
<P>
<P><h3>Authentication Protocols</h3>
 
<P>
Negotiation of authentication protocols occurs immediately after link
quality determination and before network layer negotiation. The two most
common types of authentication protocols are as follows:

<UL><LI>Password Authentication Protocol (PAP) uses clear text passwords and is
   the least sophisticated authentication protocol. It is typically
   negotiated if the remote workstation and server cannot negotiate a more
   secure form of validation. The Windows NT RAS server has an option that
   prevents clear text passwords from being negotiated. This enables
</UL>system
<PRE>   administrators to enforce a high level of security.

</PRE><LI>Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) uses a challenge
   response with a one way encryption on the response.
<P>
</UL>Windows NT version 3.5 will always negotiate encrypted authentication when
communicating with each other. When connecting to third-party remote
access
servers or client software, RAS may negotiate clear text authentication if
the third-party product does not support encrypted authentication.
<P>
<P><h3>Network Control Protocols</h3>
 
<P>
The three most common types of Network Control protocols are as follows:

<UL><LI>Internet Protocol Control Protocol (IPCP) is used for configuring,
   enabling, and disabling IP Protocol modules at both ends of the link.

<LI>Internet Packet eXchange Control Protocol (IPXCP) is used for
   configuring, enabling and disabling IPX protocol modules on both ends
</UL>of
<PRE>   the Link. IPXCP is widely implemented by PPP vendors. IPX-WAN protocol
   is Novell's alternative to IPXCP. IPX-WAN is not compatible with IPXCP.
   Over time, IPX-WAN and IPXCP may converge to provide one standard for
   IPX network configuration over wide area network. Windows NT 3.5
   provides support for IPXCP which is implemented by the vast majority of
   remote access vendors today. Windows NT 3.5 does not yet support IPX-
   WAN.

</PRE><LI>NetBIOS Frames Control Protocol (NBF CP) is used for configuring,
   enabling and disabling NetBEUI protocol modules on both ends of the
   link. NBF CP is a Microsoft proposed protocol for NetBEUI
</UL>configuration.
<PRE>   NBF CP is in "draft" status with the Internet Engineering Task Force
   (IETF).
   \* Include RFC 1717 - MultiLink and a RFC candidate for PPTP. This
   \* applies to NT 4.0
</PRE>&lt;Type new or changed text here.&gt;
<P>
<PRE>   The Microsoft NBF extension for PPP is documented at:

      FTP://FTP.MICROSOFT.COM/DEVELOPR/RFC/NBFCP.TXT.

   This document is a proposed RFC for the NBF control protocol.
