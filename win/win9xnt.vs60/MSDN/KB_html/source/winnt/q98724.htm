The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
Password validation in a Windows NT network is case-sensitive as long
as the machine you are logged onto and the machine whose resource you
are trying to access are both Windows NT machines; the case of the
password entered and the password stored in the Windows NT user
database must match. However, if a logon procedure takes place on a
non-Windows NT machine (a Windows for Workgroups machine, for example)
or the share being accessed is on a non-Windows NT server (even if the
server is in a Windows NT domain), password validation becomes case-
insensitive. There is one exception to these rules and one error that
results from mismatched case in passwords.
<P>
The exception is that if you change your password from a non-Windows
NT machine (using the Windows NT NET PASSWORD command), Windows NT
stores your new password as a case-insensitive password and permits
all subsequent log ons to be password case-insensitive. Even if
another user logs on from a Windows NT machine, no password case
checking is performed.
<P>
An error can be generated if you mismatch the case of your password
after you've already logged onto a Windows NT domain. For example, if
you establish a network session with a Windows NT machine by typing
the following two lines
<P>
<PRE>   net use x: \\ntmachine\data /u:domain\user PASSWORD
   net use y: \\ntmachine\apps /u:domain\user password

</PRE>the following error message is displayed:
<P>
<PRE>   System error 1219 has occurred. The credentials supplied conflict
   with an existing set of credentials.

</PRE>To avoid this error message, make sure you always use the same case
when attempting to connect to shared resources.
