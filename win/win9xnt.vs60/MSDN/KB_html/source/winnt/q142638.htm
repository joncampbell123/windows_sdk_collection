</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When Windows for Workgroups 3.11 is upgraded to Windows NT Server 3.51, the
Microsoft Mail dialog box that allows you to choose between connecting to
an existing postoffice or creating a new one does not appear if a Workgroup
postoffice (WGPO) was previously installed on the system at the time of the
upgrade. The system will allow you to add and delete new users to the
existing postoffice; however, the administrator cannot create a new
postoffice. Searching for all Msmail.ini files and deleting them does not
fix the problem, nor does deleting the existing WGPO directory structure.
<P>
If you delete the existing WGPO directory structure, you get an error
message stating
<P>
<PRE>   The configuration for the Mail Server Path is missing or invalid.

</PRE>A look at the properties for the icon in the Main group shows Msmail32.exe
as the executable file.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
The workaround for this situation is to delete the existing WGPO directory
structure and then perform the following:

<OL><P><LI>Create another user account that has Administrator privileges (copy the
   Admin account).

<P><LI>Log on to the new account.

<P><LI>Go to Main/NT Setup/Delete User Profiles.

<P><LI>Delete the Administrator's profile.

<P><LI>Log off.

<P><LI>Log on as the administrator.

<P><LI>Go to the Main group and double-click the Microsoft Mail icon--you
   should now be able to create the new postoffice.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The reason the administrator cannot create a new postoffice, even when the
Msmail.ini file is deleted and the WGPO directory structure is removed, is
because the profile for the administrator contains user-specific
information about the postoffice that was on the system. Deleting the user
profile for the administrator forces Windows NT to build a new one that
does not contain that information.
