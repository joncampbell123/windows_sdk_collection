<LI>Microsoft Peer Web Server version 3.0 for Windows NT Workstation
</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
To maintain consistency with the Windows NT Workstation licensing policy,
Microsoft implemented a hard-coded inbound HTTP connection limit with the
introduction of Peer Web Services (PWS) 3.0 for Windows NT Workstation.
<P>
Windows NT Workstation 4.0 is designed, priced, supported, and licensed for
access from up to 10 inbound computers. Therefore, the default limit to the
number of inbound HTTP connections in PWS 3.0 is 10. When the eleventh
connection to a Windows NT Workstation peer web service is attempted, the
connection is refused.
<P>
Some Web browsers, for example Internet Explorer 3.0, create as many as
four HTTP connections when retrieving pages with multiple inline images.
To accommodate these browsers and pages, it is possible to set the
connection limit as high as 40.
<P>
The Windows NT Workstation 4.0 End User License Agreement (EULA) contains
the following provision:
<P>
<PRE>   You may install the software product on a single computer for use as
   interactive workstation software, but not as server software. However,
   you may permit a maximum of ten (10) computers to connect to the
   Workstation Computer to access and use services of the software product,
   such as file and print and peer Web services.

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Questions and Answers</h3>
 
<P>
Q. How does Microsoft implement this 10 connection limit?
<P>
A. The limitation is in Peer Web Services (PWS) 3.0. It is not implemented
<PRE>   in either the operating system or the TCP/IP protocol and does not
   affect other web servers running on Windows NT Workstation.

</PRE>Q. How did Microsoft choose the maximum value of 40 connections?
<P>
A. Each browser typically uses four connections when accessing a web page.
<PRE>   To accommodate up to 10 computers connecting to the Windows NT
   Workstation PWS, Microsoft multiplied the four connections by 10
   computers, hence the maximum value of 40.

</PRE>Q. How can I increase the default limit from 10 to a number less than 40?
<P>
A. You can use Internet Service Manager to change the value of connections.
<PRE>   Go to the Properties of the Service and then change the Maximum
   Connections. You cannot set more than 40 connections as the maximum
   value.

</PRE>Q. How do I know if my machine goes above the 10-connection limit? What
<PRE>   happens if I attempt to use more than 10 connections?

</PRE>A. The connection that exceeds the set limit receives the following
<PRE>   message:

      Too many users.
      There are too many connected users. Please try again later.

   The best way to tell if a site is hitting the connection limit is to use
   Performance Monitor to monitor the number of connections to the HTTP
   service (object HTTP Service, counter Current Connections.)

</PRE>Q. Does this only apply to the WWW Service, or does it apply to FTP and
<PRE>   Gopher services, too?

</PRE>A. The inbound limitation applies to all three services of PWS.
<P>
Q. PWS 3.0 is included with Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 2. If I install
<PRE>   Service Pack 2 do I automatically upgrade PWS 2.0 (that ships with
   Windows NT 4.0) to PWS 3.0?

</PRE>A. Yes. The upgrade to Service Pack 2 includes PWS 3.0 and happens
<PRE>   automatically.

</PRE>Q. Can I go back to PWS 2.0?
<P>
A. To return to PWS 2.0, uninstall PWS 3.0 and then reinstall PWS 2.0 from
<PRE>   your original Windows NT 4.0 CD-ROM.
