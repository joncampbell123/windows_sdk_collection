The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When an application is started using the system account, it logs on with
null credentials. If it attempts to access a remote Windows NT 3.5 server
resource (using a null session), it fails. Scheduler service scripts (AT
command) and other service or application operations attempting to access
server resources over the network receive errors such as the following:
<P>
<PRE>   Error 5:  Access is denied.

</PRE>When an application using the system account uses a UNC name to access a
shared resource, the following error message is returned:
<P>
<PRE>   File Not Found

</PRE>NOTE: Scheduler service script error messages can be caught by redirecting
the AT command to a file.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Services, including the Scheduler, use null session support when logged on
as system account to interact with desktop.
<P>
Windows NT version 3.1 supports null sessions by default. However, Windows
NT version 3.5 does not provide this support unless specifically
configured to do so. This change was made in order to provide a higher
default level of security.
<P>
When a process is running under the context of the system account, it
attempts to use a null session for credentials to acquire a resource
access. AT scripts performing commands, such as NET USE, will default to
these credentials. A protocol analyzer trace reveals the null session
request associated with the Server Message Block (SMB) Session Setup &amp; X
in which no explicit credentials are passed.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Do not use the system account. Services, such as Scheduler, and custom
applications can be configured using user-specific accounts. User-specific
accounts provide user level security based on a specific account and
associated password.
<P>
NOTE: For more information, see Chapter 15: Server Manager, Assigning a
Logon Account to the Schedule Service in the "Windows NT Server 3.5 System
Guide."
<P>
If you desire null session support, you can modify the registry of each
remote resource computer as follows.
<P>
WARNINGS:

<UL><LI>A shared resource configured in this manner is not secure. Microsoft
   does not recommend this configuration if null session security is
   a consideration.

<LI>Using the Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-
   wide problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct
   them. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the
   use of the Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own
   risk.

</UL><OL><P><LI>Start the registry editor, REGEDT32.EXE

<P><LI>From the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following key:
<P>
<P><PRE>      \System

              \Parameters
                \NullSessionShares

   NOTE: NullSessionShares is type REG_MULTI_SZ

</PRE><P><LI>On a new line within the NullSessionShares key, type in the share you
   want to access with a null session (for example: "PUBLIC")

<P><LI>If your application uses Named Pipes and requires null session support.

   a. From the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following key:
<P>
<PRE>         \System
           \CurrentControlSet

       want to access with a null session.
