<UL><LI>Microsoft U.S. Service Pack 2 for Windows NT and Windows NT Advanced
   Server version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
To run the update program that installs U.S. Service Pack 2 on an Intel-
based system, you need at least 25 megabytes (MB) of free disk space on
your system partition. MIPS-based systems require 32 MB free disk space,
and DEC Alpha systems require 27 MB free disk space.
<P>
If you do not have this much free space, an error message appears when you
try to run the update and the program will stop.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The update program replaces system files on your hard disk drive by
renaming the old files and copying the new files into their place. When the
update finished, the renamed files are deleted and the system is restarted.
In order to guarantee enough space for all files on the update disks, you
must have the amount of free disk space stated above, depending on your
system type.
<P>
The free space required by the update is only used until the update is
finished. After it finishes and restarts the system, the space is available
again. Because of this, it is possible to free up space by moving files to
another drive or by backing them up and temporarily deleting them. They can
then be restored back to the system drive after the update is finished.
