<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 2 (SP2) provides support for a new DHCP
"superscope" feature. This feature allows a Windows NT DHCP server to:

<UL><LI>Support DHCP clients on locally attached networks that have multiple
   logical subnets on one physical network (sometimes referred to as a
   "multi-net").

<LI>Support DHCP clients on the far side of bootp relay agents, where the
   network on the far side of the relay agent has multiple logical subnets
   on one physical network.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Versions of Windows NT DHCP server prior to Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 2
are not capable of assigning addresses from more than one scope to a given
physical subnet. One workaround for this situation is to add additional
network interface cards (NICs) to the server, and to address each of the
NICs to a given logical IP subnet. This involves additional and otherwise
unnecessary hardware, so a new solution was developed and implemented in
SP2.
<P>
The enhanced DHCP server allows the administrator to create different
scopes (ranges of IP addresses), and then to group those scopes together
into a superscope.
<P>
To create a superscope, complete the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Create each of the scopes using DHCP Manager. Assign global and scope
   properties as desired. Be sure to enable each scope.

<P><LI>In DHCP Manager, select the DHCP server. Click Scope, and then click
   Superscopes.

<P><LI>Click Create Superscope, supply a name for the superscope, and then
   click OK.

<P><LI>Add the appropriate scopes from the Available Scopes list to the Child
   Sub-Scopes list. When finished, the Child Scopes should be listed from
   top to bottom in the order that you want addresses to be used from them.
<P>
   NOTE: The order that you add the Child Sub-Scopes is of no consequence.
   DHCP Manager will sort them in ascending order.

<P><LI>Click OK.

<P><LI>If the DHCP server is configured with the IgnorebroadcastFlag DHCP
   Registry value set to 0, and if the Superscope is on a subnet that is
   directly attached to the server (that is, not being reached via a DHCP
   relay agent), then each of the logical subnets must be directly
   reachable by the DHCP server. This means that there must be a local
   route to each logical subnet. The easiest way to accomplish this is to
   add an IP address to the NIC on the local server for each of the logical
   subnets that it is attached to.
<P>
</OL>For additional information about the IgnorebroadcastFlag DHCP Registry
value, see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
