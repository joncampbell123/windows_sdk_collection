The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Some new registry entries are available for Windows NT 4.0.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Registry path for these entries is the following:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\
   SYSTEM\
   CurrentControlSet\
   Services\
   Wins\
   Parameters
      BurstHandling
      Type = REG_DWORD
      Value: 0 or 1
      Default = 0

</PRE>This parameter is used to temporarily achieve a steady state in the WINS
server when the WINS server is either started with a clean database or many
WINS clients come online for the first time. Either situation causes a
large amount of name registration and name refresh traffic to occur. The
WINS server currently stores a maximum of 25,000 name registration and
refresh queries in its queue before dropping queries. By using this
parameter, the WINS server can be configured to send success responses to
the clients whose requests are dropped. These response will have time-to-
live (TTL) values that will slow down the refresh rate of those WINS
clients and regulate the burst of WINS client traffic. This will result in
a steady state being reached much more quickly.
<P>
To turn on this parameter, change the value to 1.
<P>
<P><h3>The ConsistencyCheck Subkey</h3>
 
<P>
This is an optional subkey that should be created if you want WINS to
periodically perform database consistency checks. The following option
values can be created under this key.
<P>
<PRE>   MaxRecsAtATime
   Type = REG_DWORD
   Range = 1000 to total number of records (decimal)
   Default = 30000

</PRE>Specifies the maximum number of records that will be replicated in one
consistency check cycle. WINS does consistency checks on the records of
each owner WINS server (the WINS server from which the record was
replicated). After checking an owner WINS server, the local WINS server
continues to the next owner WINS server, or stops. This is determined by
the MaxRecsAtATime value.
<P>
<PRE>   UseRplPnrs
   Type = REG_DWORD or nonzero value
   Range = 0 or nonzero
   Default = 0

</PRE>If set to zero, WINS will contact the owner WINS server. If set to a
nonzero value, WINS sill contact only its pull partners to perform
consistency checks. Specifies the time interval between WINS server
database consistency checks. If set to nonzero, WINS randomly picks a WINS
from its list of pull partners unless the owner WINS server also happens to
be a pull partner. In that case, the owner WINS is contacted.
<P>
<PRE>   TimeInterval
   Type = REG_DWORD
   Range = 21600 (6 hours) - entered in seconds (decimal)
   Default = 86400 (24 hours) - entered in seconds (decimal)

</PRE>Specifies the time interval between WINS server database consistency
checks.
<P>
<PRE>   SpTime
   Type = REG_SZ
   Default = 2:00:00 (2 A.M.)

</PRE>Specifies the specific time at which the first WINS server database
consistency check will occur. The time is specified in hh:mm:ss format.
Thereafter, the WINS database is periodically checked for consistency by
using the time interval specified in the TimeInterval parameter.
