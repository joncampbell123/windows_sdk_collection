The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SNA Server for Windows NT, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, and 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The following questions regarding the SNA Server LUA RUI_WRITE verb
were raised by an application developer.
<P>
Generally, when issuing the RUI_WRITE verb, the successful posting response
comes back within a second or two. However, in certain circumstances
the RUI_WRITE verb takes longer than 30 seconds to complete, which is
when our communications interface assumes the call is not going to
complete, and returns a failure to the calling application.
<P>
Questions:
<P>
1) As we cannot issue another RUI_WRITE verb on the same flow until
<PRE>   the previous one returns, are we always guaranteed to get a response
   from an RUI_WRITE verb, even if it takes longer than 30 seconds?

</PRE>Answer: Yes, the RUI application is guaranteed to receive a response to the
RUI_WRITE call. If errors occur anywhere on the connection, session, client-
server LAN session, and so forth, RUI_WRITE will complete with an error,
otherwise it will complete successfully.
<P>
<P>
2) Is there a way of canceling an outstanding RUI_WRITE call? I am
<PRE>   unaware of any method; my understanding is that RUI_PURGE only works
   with outstanding RUI_READS, and that RUI_TERM only works with RUI_INIT.

</PRE>Answer: RUI_PURGE can only be used for canceling RUI_READ verbs. There
is no way of canceling an outstanding RUI_WRITE, apart from closing the
entire session with RUI_TERM.
