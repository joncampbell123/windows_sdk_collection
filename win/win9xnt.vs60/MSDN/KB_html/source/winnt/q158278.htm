<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article discusses the benefits and inner workings of the Windows NT
4.0 Remoteboot utility.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>The Remoteboot Process</h3>
 
<P>
When you start a computer, the operating system is loaded into memory. When
a Remote Initial Program Load (RPL) ROM chip is placed on a network
interface card (NIC), the client computer will retrieve startup and
configuration software from the server when the client starts. This RPL ROM
interrupts the computer's standard startup process and redirects the calls
for the operating system to the NIC. The RPL ROM also establishes a basic
network connection between the workstation and server during the startup
process. This process is known as booting remotely, or the remoteboot
process.
<P>
<P><h3>How Remoteboot Works</h3>
 
<P>
The server provides two kinds of services to the remoteboot client. The
first service is called a Boot Block, which contains all the information
needed to start the client. The second service is called the remoteboot
profile. This profile defines the client's operating system environment
after the initial startup process. Both services are sent across the
network in frames. These frames consist of a boot request, boot
acknowledgment, boot block request, and the boot block.
<P>
When the client computer is switched on, the RPL ROM initializes and
broadcasts a Boot Request frame (FIND frame), which contains the adapter's
media access control address (adapter ID). The adapter ID is assigned by
the NIC's manufacturer, and is a unique 12-digit hexadecimal number. The
first six digits identify the adapter and the manufacturer. When the server
receives the FIND frame, it compares the adapter ID to the database of
known adapters. If the server does not recognize the adapter ID or if the
adapter ID does not have an assigned profile, the server records the
information temporarily in its database but does not respond to the
client's request. The client continues to send FIND frames until it
receives an acknowledgment (ACK).
<P>
If the server has a match for the adapter ID with a valid profile, it
responds with an acknowledgment (FOUND frame). This frame contains the
server's adapter ID and the client's adapter ID. At this point, the DLC
protocol is being used for all communications between the client and the
server. If multiple Remoteboot servers reply to the initial FIND broadcast,
the client only responds to the first received ACK.
<P>
After the client receives the ACK, it then sends a request for the boot
block request (SEND.FILE.REQUEST frame) to the first server that replied.
The server receives the request and replies with a boot block
(FILE.DATA.RESPONSE frame) telling the client where the boot image file is
located.
<P>
After the client receives this information, it passes control from the RPL
ROM and starts running the entry point of the boot block. At this point the
operating system is being loaded into memory, and the system switches from
DLC to the real-mode network drivers (usually NetBEUI).
<P>
<P><h3>The Windows 95 Remote Boot Process</h3>
 
<P>
Windows 95 uses the same process, except for a few differences.
<P>
Windows 95 creates a RAM disk to act as a hard disk drive, and then copies
the real-mode files from the server to the RAM disk. After the information
has been loaded into the RAM disk, it loads the real-mode drivers and
connects to the server, which contains a server-based setup and computer
directory for Windows 95.
<P>
<P><h3>Why Use Remoteboot?</h3>
 
<P>
Remoteboot allows for a secured network by eliminating the need for hard or
floppy disk drives. Users cannot load programs or infect the network with
viruses. It also allows greater control over the distribution of software.
In addition, centralized software updates reduce costs.
