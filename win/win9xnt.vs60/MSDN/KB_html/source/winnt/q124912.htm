The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5
<LI>Microsoft LAN Manager version 2.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
All networks that have Windows NT version 3.5 Domain Controllers (DCs) and
LAN Manager Backup Domain Controllers (BDCs) experience this problem. Some
symptoms of this issue can be a general slowness of the Windows NT version
3.5 DC because of the constant syncing of the LAN Manager BDCs. Symptoms
for this problem include:

<UL><LI>Slow file directory enumeration from client workstations.

<LI>Slow printing when the printers are locally connected the client
   workstations.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
A design change in Windows NT version 3.5 causes the entire membership of
groups (containing new users) to be sent to the LAN Manager BDC. If the
total amount of this data is greater than the buffer allocated by the BDC
for the DC, it requests a larger buffer. If the second buffer is also too
small, the BDC goes into a full sync condition.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To reduce the likelihood of encountering this problem, change the LAN
Manager BDC so that it initially allocates a buffer of 64K.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has changed Windows NT so it now sends a list of only the groups
that new users belong to, instead of the entire membership of the groups.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Workstation and
Windows NT Server version 3.5. This problem has been corrected in the
latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT version 3.5. For information on
obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

</PRE>To correct this problem on your LAN Manager BDC servers, contact Microsoft
Product Support Services to get the LAN Manager patch, CSD00.108.
