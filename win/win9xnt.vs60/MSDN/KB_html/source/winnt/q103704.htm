The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5 and 3.51
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5 and 3.51

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If you have a Windows NT workstation in a Windows NT Advanced Server
domain and you want to change the machine's computer name, the machine
must leave the domain and rejoin the domain in order for the change to
take effect.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Pages 151-152 in the Windows NT "System Guide" instruct you to change
a Windows NT workstation's computer name as follows:

<OL><P><LI>Have the Windows NT Advanced Server domain administrator create an
   account for the new computer name.

<P><LI>In the Network Settings dialog box, choose the Change button next
   to the computer name.

<P><LI>In the Computer Name dialog box, type a unique name (the new name)
   for the computer, and choose OK.
<P>
</OL>This procedure results in your Windows NT workstation being unable to
log on in the Windows NT Advanced Server domain with any user account.
(It makes no difference if the Windows NT Advanced Server domain
administrator creates the computer name before or after the computer
name change.)
<P>
If you find that you are unable to log on in an Windows NT Advanced
Server domain after a name change, you should log on to your local
database as an admin user. Next, leave the Windows NT Advanced Server
domain by either joining another Windows NT Advanced Server domain or
by selecting any workgroup. After you reboot the system, your machine
can rejoin the original domain with the new computer name; you will be
correctly prompted with the "WELCOME TO THE &lt;original domain&gt; DOMAIN"
message.
<P>
NOTE: You cannot add the new computer name for the Windows NT
workstation in the domain by reentering the current domain name and
providing an Admin account for the domain. The machine must leave and
rejoin the domain.

Step-by-Step Instructions for Changing a Computer Name on a
<P><h3>Windows NT Workstation in a Windows NT Advanced Server Domain</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create a new machine account for the Windows NT workstation in the
   Windows NT Advanced Server domain.

<P><LI>Choose the Network icon in Control Panel, choose the Change button
   next to the current domain name, and enter any workgroup name or
   the name of another Windows NT Advanced Server domain.
<P>
   NOTE: If you choose another Windows NT Advanced Server domain, you
   will need an administrator of that domain to create a machine
   account for you in Server Manager or you will need to provide an
   admin account and password so that you can add the machine account
   to the Windows NT Advanced Server domain.

<P><LI>Choose the Network icon in Control Panel and change the computer
   name of the Windows NT workstation to the new name.
<P>
   NOTE: Once a computer name is changed, the Change button for the
   domain named is dimmed, which indicates that you cannot change the
   computer name and the domain name at the same time unless you
   change the domain name first, as indicated by the order of steps 2
   and 3.

<P><LI>When prompted, reboot the system in order for the domain name and
   computer name changes to take affect.

<P><LI>Log on to the local machine with Admin privileges.

<P><LI>Choose the Network icon in Control Panel, choose the Change button
   next to the domain name, and enter the original domain name.
<P>
   NOTE: In step 1, you created a new machine account, and as a
   result, you will not need to provide a valid administrator and
   password for the original domain.
<P>
   You will receive the "WELCOME TO THE &lt;original domain&gt; DOMAIN"
   message.

<P><LI>When prompted, reboot the system so that the domain name change
   can take effect.
<P>
</OL>You should now be able to log on to the Windows NT Advanced Server
domain with any valid account.
