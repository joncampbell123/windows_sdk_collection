<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Broderbund's children's game Grandma And Me fails during installation but
still can be run.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
During installation, the application opens a file with the exclusive
attribute and then tries to open it again. Windows NT does not allow this,
but MS-DOS does. Because the installation is only creating an icon in
Program Manager, its failure does not prevent running the application.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
You can run the game directly from the CD using File Manager or create
your own icon.
<P>
To run the application from File Manager, select the CD-ROM drive and
double-click on the application's .EXE file.
<P>
To install an icon for the application:

<OL><P><LI>Open Program Manager.

<P><LI>From the File menu, select New.

<P><LI>Select Program Item and fill in the path to the file as the command
   line. For instance, if the file is called GAME.EXE in the directory
   BIN on drive E:, fill in E:\BIN\GAME.EXE as the command line. You can
   safely leave all the other fields alone.
