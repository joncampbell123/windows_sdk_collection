The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you try to access a floppy disk drive to read the contents of a disk,
the following error message is displayed:
<P>
<PRE>   A:\ is not accessible. The requested resource is in use.

</PRE>NOTE: Substitute "B:\" if you are using a second floppy drive.
<P>
When you click the floppy disk drive, the light does not come on. Other
operating systems such as MS-DOS or Windows 95 can access the drive with no
errors.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Qic117.sys driver can be used on the following tape devices; each of
these devices runs off the floppy controller:

<UL><LI>HP Colorado T3000
<LI>HP Colorado T1000
<LI>Wangtek QIC-3010 floppy
<P>
<P>
</UL>Qic117.sys will load if the driver startup type is set to SYSTEM, or a Tape
Devices/Detect is performed. When the driver loads, it makes the following
calls:
<P>
<PRE>   kdi_GetFloppyController() - acquires resources
   kdi_ReleaseFloppyController() - releases resources
   kdi_GetFloppyController() - acquires resources

</PRE>At this point, the driver stops and waits until it is needed again.
<P>
After the calls are made, the user cannot use the floppy disk drive because
the tape device is using all the resources.
<P>
When using a tape device that runs off the floppy controller, the floppy
disk drive and tape device cannot be used simultaneously. This will ensure
maximum performance for the tape drive and prevent changes to the hard disk
drive caused by someone using the floppy disk drive while the backup or
restore is in progress.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this issue, perform the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>In Control Panel, double-click Devices.

<P><LI>From the list of devices, select the corresponding tape device.

<P><LI>Click Startup.

<P><LI>Select Automatic from the Startup Type list.

<P><LI>Click OK.

<P><LI>Click the Close button for the Devices tool.
<P>
</OL>This procedure should effectively set the startup type for the Qic117.sys
driver so that it does not load until a backup is started.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The floppy disk drive will now work until a backup starts, but, after the
backup completes, the error message listed above will appear when you try
to access the floppy drive. The only way to again gain access to the floppy
disk drive is to restart the computer.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. We
are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
