<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Windows NT system policies are designed for when a user logs on to a domain
account database. There are times, however, that it is necessary to have
policies on a Windows NT workstation or server computer that is not
participating in a domain or when you need a different policy for users who
are logged on to the local account database.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
There are two basic ways to set up locally-based system policies. To use
these on a workstation or server running Windows NT 4.0 (not a domain
controller), follow one of the following procedures:
<P>
<P><h3>Automatic Update Method</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Share the Winnt\System32\Repl\Import\Scripts folder (where Winnt is the
   name of your Windows directory) as Netlogon.

<P><LI>Grant the group Everyone "Read" Permissions and the group
   Administrators "Full Control" to this share.

<P><LI>Start System Policy Editor (Poledit.exe) and make the changes for your
   policy. Start with something simple such as "Remove Run command from
   Start Menu" from Shell/Restrictions in the Users Properties window.

<P><LI>Double-click Local Computer, double-click Network, double-click System
   Policies Update, and then click Remote Update so that it is selected.

<P><LI>In the Update Mode box, click Automatic (Use Default Path), and then
   click OK.

<P><LI>Save your policy to the location listed above as Ntconfig.pol.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: This configuration will allow you to use both a local and a
domain-wide system policy, depending on which user account database the
user logs on to.
<P>
<P><h3>Remote Update Method</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start System Policy Editor(Poledit.exe) and make the changes for your
   policy.

<P><LI>Double-click Local Computer, double-click Network, double-click System
   Policies Update, and then click Remote Update so that it is selected.

<P><LI>In the Update Mode box, click Manual (Use Specific Path), and then click
   OK.

<P><LI>Type a path name in the Path for Manual Update dialog box (for example,
   c:\winnt\ system32\repl\import\scripts\Ntconfig.pol).

<P><LI>Save your policy to the location listed above as Ntconfig.pol. While
   using the Manual Update, you may name the policy file anything you would
   like; just be sure to enter it into the path in step 4 above.
<P>
</OL>TIP: Every person or computer that logs on after a policy is in place is
subject to the policy. Therefore, it is a good idea to not edit the default
user or computer until you are familiar with System Policies. A good idea
to use is to make a test user/group account in "User Manager" and then make
a specific policy for this user/group in System Policy Editor. After you
have the policy working properly you can then transfer the policy to the
production environment.
