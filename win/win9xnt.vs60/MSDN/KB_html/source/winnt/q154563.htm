<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When attempting to run an application that relies on the search drive
vector being set, it will not work correctly because the search drive
vector is not set.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft LOGIN.EXE program fails to set the shell's search drive
vector. The search drive vector is used in conjunction with various levels
of search mode (as set by the SMODE value) to provide enhanced file search
capabilities (over and above the normal search for executable files along
the MS-DOS search path). For example, the shell's search mode can be set to
a value that directs the shell to search for data files along the search
path specified by the search drive vector. Of course, if the search drive
vector is not set (as is the case with the Microsoft LOGIN program), such
searches performed by the shell will fail.
<P>
The search drive vector is a 17-byte field internal to the NETX shell.
Each of the first 16 bytes contains the ordinal number of a drive
letter (0xFF indicates the end of the vector) and the last byte is
always set to 0xFF. Normally, the login program will set this vector to
equal all the network drives that have been added to the path (by MAP
INS). The SetSearchDriveVector API is Int 0x21, Function 0xE9, SubFunction
0x02.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Obtain the fix referenced below. Login.exe, Logout.exe, and Map.exe have
been modified to correctly set the search drive vector.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in File and Print Services for
NetWare version 3.51. This problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT
3.51 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack,
query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
