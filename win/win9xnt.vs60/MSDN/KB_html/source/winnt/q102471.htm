The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
You can replicate directories or files from a Windows NT NTFS volume
to an OS/2 (with LAN Manager 2.x) FAT volume if the filenames meet FAT
style naming conventions. The same is true for OS/2 as long as the
filenames meet OS/2 HPFS style naming conventions.
<P>
Directories or files that do not meet the FAT naming convention (8.3),
cannot be replicated from a Windows NT Advanced Server NTFS file
system volume to an MS OS/2 LAN Manager 2.x FAT volume.
<P>
Directories or files can be replicated from a Windows NT Advanced
Server NTFS volume to an MS OS/2 LAN Manager 2.x HPFS volume; however,
the names of the directories or files must meet the HPFS conventions.
<P>
HPFS filenames must meet the following conventions:

<UL><LI>Names can be up to 254 characters.
<LI>Paths and filenames can together be up to 259 characters long.
<LI>Blank spaces and periods can occur anywhere in the file or
   directory name.
<LI>The following characters can be used in naming HPFS files:
<P>
<P><PRE>      [ ] , + = ;
</PRE>
<LI>The following characters are not currently allowed:
<P>
<P><PRE>      &lt; &gt; : " / \ | * ? &amp;
</PRE>
<LI>You can use uppercase, lowercase, or mixed case.
<P>
</UL>NTFS filenames must meet the following conventions:

<UL><LI>Names can be up to 255 characters long.
<LI>The following characters are not currently allowed:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ? " / \ &lt; &gt; * | :
</PRE><P>
</UL>NOTE: Windows NT Advanced Server can function as both an import and
export replication server. Standard Windows NT can function as only an
import server. MS OS/2 LAN Manager can function as both an import and
an export server. You can also export from an OS/2 LAN Manager server
to a Windows NT workstation.
<P>

file systems, query on the following key words in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:
