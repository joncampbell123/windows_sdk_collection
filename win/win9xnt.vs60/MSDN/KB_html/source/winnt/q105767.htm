<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The following error message appears after you start Microsoft Mail for the
first time and attempt to create a new workgroup postoffice or to connect
to an existing postoffice:
<P>
<PRE>   Mail cannot be started because it cannot update
   its configuration information.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs if any one of the following conditions
are true:

<UL><LI>There is no Mail key in HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft.

<LI>You do not have the permissions needed to modify
   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft.

<LI>You do not have the permissions needed to modify the WIN.INI file.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them.
Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of
Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.
<P>
<P><h3>There is no Mail key in HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft</h3>
 
<P>
To correct this problem:

<OL><P><LI>Run Registry Editor (REGEDT32.EXE).

<P><LI>From the HKEY_CURRENT_USER subtree, go to the following key:
<P>
<P><PRE>      \Software\Microsoft
</PRE>
<P><LI>From the Edit menu, choose Add Key.

<P><LI>Type "Mail" (without the quotation marks) in the Key Name text box.

<P><LI>Choose OK and then restart Mail.
<P>
</OL>You do not have the permissions needed to modify
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft
 
<P>
To correct this problem:

<OL><P><LI>Run Registry Editor (REGEDT32.EXE).

<P><LI>From the HKEY_CURRENT_USER subtree, go to the following key:
<P>
<P><PRE>      \Software\Microsoft\Mail
</PRE>
<P><LI>From the Security menu, choose Permissions.

<P><LI>Verify the current permissions for the key and:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Add your user account with the appropriate permissions
      (the default is Full Control).
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      -or-
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - Log off from your current user account and log on to a user
      account that has the appropriate permissions for this key.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Restart Mail.
<P>
</OL><h3>You do not have the permissions needed to modify the WIN.INI file</h3>
 
<P>
To correct this problem:

<OL><P><LI>Run File Manager.

<P><LI>Select the WIN.INI file in the %SYSTEMROOT% directory (typically
   C:\WINDOWS or C:\WINNT).

<P><LI>From the Security menu, choose Permissions.

<P><LI>Verify the current permissions for the key and:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Add your user account with the appropriate permissions
      (the default is Full Control).
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      -or-
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - Log off from your current user account and log on to a user
      account that has the appropriate permissions for this file.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Restart Mail.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>There is no Mail key in HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft</h3>
 
<P>
If you inadvertently delete this key, Mail is unable to place its settings
in the appropriate subkeys. This results in the following:

<OL><P><LI>The error message reference above appears.

<P><LI>Mail does not place any settings in the Registry.

<P><LI>If you choose to create a new workgroup postoffice, Mail does not create
   the WGPO directory structure.

<P><LI>If you choose to connect to an existing postoffice and have not yet
   created a Mail account for yourself, Mail creates the Mail account on
   the postoffice

<P><LI>Mail does not create a local message folder (.MMF) for your Mail
   account.

<P><LI>Mail creates a WIN.INI, if one did not exist before the Mail
   initialization procedure, but places no settings in it.

<P><LI>Mail closes.

<P><LI>The next time you start Mail, it starts the initialization process
   again.
<P>
</OL>You do not have the permissions needed to modify
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft
 
<P>
If you do not have the appropriate Registry key permissions to modify the
Mail key in the Registry path specified above, Mail is unable to place its
settings within the subkeys of this key. This has the result as the
previous cause.
<P>
<P><h3>You do not have the permissions needed to modify the WIN.INI file</h3>
 
<P>
If the WIN.INI file is located on a Windows NT file system (NTFS)
partition, and you do not have the appropriate file permissions to modify
the file, Mail writes the following information to the WIN.INI file upon
completion of the initialization sequence:
<P>
<PRE>   [Mail]
   MAPI=1

</PRE></OL>If the WIN.INI file does not exist, Mail re-creates it, and places the
above settings in it for 16-bit application support. If the WIN.INI file
exists, but you do not have the appropriate file permissions to edit it,
Mail is unable to place its settings in the file. This results in the
following:

<OL><P><LI>The error message reference above appears.

<P><LI>Mail places some settings in the Registry, as follows.
<P>
<P><PRE>    - The Custom Commands subkey is created, but is missing the
      WGPOMgr1 and WGPOMgr2 values.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - The Custom Messages subkey is created.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - The Microsoft Mail subkey is created, but is missing the Login,
      MAPIHELP, OfflineMessages, ServerPassword, ServerPath, and Window
      values.
</PRE>
<P><LI>If you choose to create a new workgroup postoffice, Mail does not create
   the WGPO directory structure.

<P><LI>If you choose to connect to an existing postoffice and have not yet
   created a Mail account for yourself, Mail creates the Mail account on
   the postoffice.

<P><LI>Mail does not create a local message folder (.MMF) for your Mail
   account.

<P><LI>The WIN.INI file is not modified.

<P><LI>Mail closes.

<P><LI>The next time you start Mail, it starts the initialization process
   again.
