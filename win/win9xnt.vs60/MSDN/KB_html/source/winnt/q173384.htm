<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Deleting the %SystemRoot%\Repair folder from a Windows NT 3.51 or 4.0
Server or Workstation installation produces the following problems:

<UL><LI>You cannot install a Windows NT Service Pack.
<P>
   When you run the Update program from the Windows NT service pack you
   receive the following error message:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Service Pack Setup could not find the Setup.log file in your repair
      directory.
</PRE><P>
   The Update program will not continue.

<LI>You cannot create an Emergency Repair Disk.
<P>
   When you run Rdisk to update and create an Emergency Repair Disk, it
   fails with the following error message:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Repair Disk Utility could not copy all files to the Emergency Repair
      Disk. One or more files were not found.
</PRE><P>
   This error occurs after the update option has finished copying the
   following files to the newly created repair folder:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Autoexec.nt
      Config.nt
      ntuser.da_ New user profile (V4.0 only)
      Software._ Software Registry hive
<PRE></PRE>      System._   System Registry hive

</PRE></UL>The following files are missing from the repair folder and are
necessary for a good Emergency Repair Disk.
<P>
<PRE>     Sam._      Sam Registry hive
     Security._ Security hive
     Default._  Default user profile
     SETUP.LOG file

<P><h3>Windows NT 4.0</h3>
 
<P>
To fix both problems, you can do an in-place upgrade of Windows NT 4.0.
If your computer is running Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 2 or earlier and is
formatted as NTFS or FAT, perform the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Start the system from Setup Disk One of the three Windows NT setup
   disks. After you insert the second setup disk, select "To setup Windows
   NT now, Press ENTER".

<P><LI>Select a mass storage device, and then insert Setup Disk Three.

<P><LI>Select "To upgrade Windows NT in the directory above, press ENTER."
   Verify that the folder is the one you want to upgrade and press
   Enter. Press Esc to bypass exhaustive examination.
<P>

   new %SystemRoot%\Repair folder and Setup.log file. You are also
   asked to create an Emergency Repair Disk. Click Yes, and create an
   Emergency Repair Disk.
<P>
