The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51 and 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51 and 4.0
</UL> 
 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you are logged on to a server or workstation without Administrative
rights, the logoff screen saver included in the Windows NT 3.51 and 4.0
Resource Kits does not function properly.
<P>
You will also get the following error when attempting to use the utility
without administrative rights.
<P>
<PRE>   Error encountered while creating registry key. Make sure you have set
   values and create subkey permissions.

</PRE><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
In order for non-administrators to be able to use WINEXIT, you must add
Set Value and Create Subkey permissions for the group Everyone on the
following Registry key:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_Local_Machine\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion.

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
WINEXIT is a screen saver that logs the current user off after the
specified time has elapsed. In other respects, it is similar to other
screen savers and can be configured and tested on the Screen Saver tab of
the Display Properties dialog box in Control Panel.
<P>
WINEXIT displays a dialog box in which it displays the countdown timer and
a user-defined message. When the countdown timer reaches zero, the log off
process is initiated.
<P>
To activate WINEXIT, perform the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Settings, and click Control Panel,
   then double-click the Display icon.

<P><LI>On the Screen Saver tab, select Windows Exit from the Screen Saver
   list.

<P><LI>In the Wait box, select the number of minutes of inactivity before the
   screen saver appears.

<P><LI>To configure the screen saver, click Settings. In the Force
   Logoff box, select the Force Application Termination checkbox to have
   the system close all running applications regardless of their current
   state.
<P>
   By default, this checkbox is not selected and the system queries
   applications to see if work needs to be saved before forcing the
   application to quit. Use this setting with caution because applications
   with unsaved data will not have a chance to save their work.

<P><LI>In the Time To Log Off box, type the time WinExit will display its
   logoff dialog box before proceeding with the log off process. Type a
   value between 0 and 999 seconds.

<P><LI>In the Logoff Message box, type a message to display in the logoff
   dialog box. The message is limited to 255 characters and will be
   truncated if extra characters are typed.

<P><LI>To start the screen saver temporarily, click the Preview button. To
   return to Windows, move your mouse.
<P>
   NOTE: You can now test Windows Exit screen saver by clicking Preview on
   the Screen Saver tab without WINEXIT attempting to log you off.
<P>
</OL>When activated, WINEXIT beeps, indicating that the log off process is
about to begin, and displays the logoff dialog box. If no action is taken
and the countdown timer reaches zero, the system will initiate the log off
procedure. You can abort the process before the countdown timer reaches
zero by either moving the mouse pointer over the dialog box or pressing
any key on the keyboard.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51 &amp;
4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
