IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a
Registry Key" Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
At some point after you install Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3, the computer
experiences a STOP 0xC000021A during normal operation.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When Performance Monitor is used to monitor a computer remotely, the
initiating computer attaches to the target computer's Winlogon process
through remote procedure call (RPC). Winlogon has a performance library
component for collecting data. The shared data is passed from the
performance dll to Winlogon on the target computer. Performance dll’s
sometimes misbehave and overwrite their buffers. In the case of
remote monitoring, this overwrite occurs in the context of the Winlogon
process and causes an access violation on the target computer. This
compromises the Winlogon subsystem and potentially causes a breach in
security.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Perform one of the following procedures:

<UL><LI>Fix the extensible performance counter so that it doesn't overwrite its
   buffers. Performance DLL’s export (make available to other modules)
   three functions - Open, Collect, and Close (see "Creating the
   Performance DLL" in the Microsoft WIN32 Software Developer's Kit).
   Usually the Collect function is the culprit.
<P>
 -or-

<LI>Windows NT can be configured to write a guard page on either side of the
   shared memory buffer with various levels of checking. This technology
   was enabled by default up to Service Pack 3 but caused too many page
   faults for large counters, significantly degrading system performance.
   In Service Pack 3 the guard pages and checking were turned off by
   default. To enable this guard page technology, create this value under
   the following subkey:
<P>
</UL>WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor
can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

<OL><P><LI>Run Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

<P><LI>From the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following key:
<P>
<P><PRE>      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT
      \CurrentVersion\Perflib
</PRE>
<P><LI>Click Add Value on the Edit menu.

<P><LI>Add the following value:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Value Name: ExtCounterTestLevel
      Data Type: REG_DWORD
      Data: 2
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      NOTE: The ExtCounterTestLevel value ranges from 1 to 4:
<PRE></PRE>         1 - Most extensive testing, can be expensive.
         2 - Basic testing.
         3 - No testing.
         4 - Don't even allocate a guard page (default from Service
             Pack 3 onwards).

</PRE><P><LI>Click OK and then quit Registry Editor.

<P><LI>Shut down and restart Windows NT.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Commercial
Internet System version 1.0. We are researching this problem and will post
new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
