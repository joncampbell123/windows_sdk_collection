<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you are have problems installing 3com Etherdisk drivers for
Etherlink and the Etherlink III (R) Bus Master Adapters, the
troubleshooting guide below will help you with a smooth installation.
<P>
If the adapter diagnostic tests fail, the adapter might not be defective.
Check the following:

<UL><LI>Make sure the adapter is completely seated in its slot. Review
   the installation instructions in the appropriate adapter guide.

<LI>If you are running the Group 2 test, make sure the adapter is securely
   connected to a loopback plug or to a properly cabled network.

<LI>If you are running the Group 3 test, make sure the adapter is
   securely connected to a properly cabled network and an echo server is
   set up on the network.

<LI>Make sure the configuration setting for the transceiver type is
   correct.

<LI>Running Group 2 tests while connected to an active network can cause
   intermittent failures. These failures can be avoided by using a
   loopback plug or by connecting to an inactive network on which only
   the computer being tested is operating.

<LI>If you installed a twisted-pair adapter, check the LED on the
   back plate of the adapter. The LED should be checked only during or
   after the diagnostic tests have been run. The LED will be on when
   there is a correct connection between the adapter and the hub. The
   LED will flash if the polarity of the connection is swapped.

<LI>Install the adapter in another slot and run the tests again. The slot
   in the computer may be defective.

<LI>Install the adapter in a known, functioning computer and run the tests
   again. The computer in which the adapter is installed might be
   defective.

<LI>Try a different loopback plug. The loopback plug you are using might be
   defective.

<LI>Replace the failed adapter with a known working adapter with the same
   configuration. If the second adapter fails, something is probably
   wrong with the test environment, not with the adapter.
