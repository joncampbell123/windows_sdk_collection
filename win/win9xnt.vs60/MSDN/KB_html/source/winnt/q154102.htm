The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51 and 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Windows NT Server has a license logging service (LLS) that maintains a
database of licensed users. When you exceed the number of available
licenses, clients receive a warning dialog box. The warning message text is
different depending on the client attempting to log on to the Windows NT
server.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
A client, when using on of the following methods, may receive one of the
following error messages when attempting to connect to a Windows NT server:
<P>
When a Macintosh client connects to Windows NT server using the Apple
Standard UAMS:
<P>
<PRE>   This file server will not allow any additional users to log on. Try
   again later.

</PRE>When a Macintosh client connects to Windows NT server using Microsoft
Authentication:
<P>
<PRE>   Server was unable to open another session.

</PRE>Additional licenses must be purchased to bring the server up to compliance
with the license logging service. When new licenses have been purchased,
open Control Panel, open Licensing, and increase the number of client
licenses to the correct number you have purchased. When the Windows NT
Server is installed from a not-for-resale (NFR) edition of Microsoft
BackOffice, there is a limit on the total number of clients able to log on
to the server. The following message will appear if the administrator
attempts to go into the Control Panel and open Licensing.
<P>
<PRE>   Not Available in NFR (Not For Resale) Edition of BackOffice

</PRE>The administrator must choose OK in the dialog box that indicates
compliance to the special agreement with the NFR product before the
Licensing Manager will close. The NFR version is for demonstration only and
is not to be used in production environments, and upgrading the NFR product
to the full retail version is not supported.
