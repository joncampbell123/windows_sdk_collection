<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If your computer runs Windows NT with an uninterruptable power supply (UPS)
and the Windows NT UPS service installed and a power failure occurs, the
UPS service initiates the Windows NT shutdown. One of the following
symptoms occur when the battery shutdown signal is sent to the battery and
the battery shuts down and turns off the computer:

<UL><LI>Windows NT shuts down and then restarts or has already rebooted again
   before the UPS turns off the computer.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Windows NT shuts down just in time when the computer turns off.
<P>
   NOTE: This is not a problem.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Windows NT is still in the process of shutting down when the computer
   turns off.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The length of time the UPS waits before turning off the computer, also
called the Shutdown Wait, is hard coded to two minutes.
<P>
The UPS service has no way of knowing exactly when the shut down of Windows
NT is complete, because the UPS service runs in User Mode.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To customize the Shutdown Wait period to your computer, install the fix
mentioned below and change your registry as follows:
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them.
Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of
Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

<OL><P><LI>Ensure that you have the following three options enabled in Control
   Panel UPS and that the UPS device has the capability to perform
   these options:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Power Fail Signal
    - Low Battery Signal
    - Remote UPS Shutdown
</PRE>
<P><LI>Run Registry Editor (REGEDT32.EXE).

<P><LI>From the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following key:
<P>
<P><PRE>      \SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\UPS
</PRE>
<P><LI>From the Edit menu, choose Add Value.

<P><LI>Add the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Value Name: ShutdownWait
      Data Type:  REG_DWORD
      Data: &lt;0 to 600 seconds&gt;
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: The default wait time is still two minutes.

<P><LI>Choose OK and quit Registry Editor.

<P><LI>Shut down and restart Windows NT.
<P>
</OL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
This problem has been corrected in the latest Service Pack for Windows NT
version 3.51.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
