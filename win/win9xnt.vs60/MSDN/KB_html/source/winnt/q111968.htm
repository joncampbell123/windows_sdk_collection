The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
You can connect to a stand-alone Windows NT computer acting as a server
when you configure a LAN Manager for OS/2 client on an OS/2 1.x or an IBM
OS/2 2.x computer, but you will experience some functional limitations.
<P>
When you connect the OS/2 client to a Windows NT Advanced Server computer
or a LAN Manager server computer, you do not experience these limitations.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following are some of the functional limitations you may experience
when you connect to a stand-alone Windows NT computer from a LAN Manager
OS/2 client.
<P>
<P><h3>Domain Not Available</h3>
 
<P>
A stand-alone Windows NT computer can only be configured for a workgroup.
To have a domain on the computer, you must have a connection to a Windows
NT Advanced Server computer. This creates a problem when you try to
configure the OS/2 client software. The OS/2 client setup interface only
allows you to specify a domain. You can workaround this limitation by
specifying the workgroup name with which you configured the Windows NT
computer.
<P>
<P><h3>Cannot View Clients from Windows NT</h3>
 
<P>
You cannot view or browse the LAN Manager clients from the Windows NT
computer. This is true even if you have selected the "Make Browser
Broadcasts to LAN Manager 2.x Clients" option in the Server Configuration
dialog box of the Network applet of Control Panel.
<P>
<P><h3>View Menu Options Unavailable</h3>
 
<P>
Without the Enable LAN Manager Broadcasts option for the Server software
selected in the Network Settings dialog box, most of the options in the
View menu of the Net Admin screen for the client software are unavailable,
including the following:
<P>
<PRE>   Available Resources
   Printer Queues
   Com-Device Queues
   Shared Resources
   Users on Server

</PRE><h3>Cannot Always View Server</h3>
 
<P>
Without the "Make Browser Broadcasts to LAN Manager 2.x Clients" option
selected on the Windows NT computer, you will not be able to Net View the
server computer from the client computer, and the server computer will not
appear as an available resource in the main window of the Net Admin utility
on the client computer.
<P>
<P><h3>Error Messages from View Menu</h3>
 
<P>
Most of the options on the client's Net Admin View menu become available if
you enable LAN Manager broadcasts on the Windows NT computer and set the
focus on the Windows NT computer in the Net Admin dialog box. However,
various error messages appear if you try to select any of the options in
the View menu. These error messages all relate to the Windows NT computer
not providing the full range of server services that a Windows NT Advanced
Server or a LAN Manager server computer would provide. The following are
the affected Net Admin View menu options and the associated error messages
that are displayed when you attempt to select the options:
<P>
<PRE>Option                       Error Message
</PRE> 
<P>
<PRE>Printer Queues...            "NET 2152 - The Printer destination
                              cannot be found."

Users on a Server...         "SYS0050: The Network request is
                              not supported."

Users on a Server...         "Net2142: The requested API isn't
                              supported on the remote server."

Select a domain to View...   "The domain controller for &lt;domain
                              name&gt; could not be found."
