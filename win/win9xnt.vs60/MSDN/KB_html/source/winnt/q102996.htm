<P>
<P><h2>Alerter Service Entries</h2>
 
<P>
Entries for this service appear under the following subkey:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Alerter\Parameters

AlertNames     REG_MULTI_SZ     List
   Specifies the list of users to whom administrator alerts are sent.
   This value can be set using the Server Manager. Default: NULL

</PRE><h2>AppleTalk and MacFile Service Entries for SFM</h2>
 
<P>
Services For Macintosh (SFM) does not appear in the Registry until you
install SFM using the Network icon in Control Panel. After
installation, the SFM value entries appear under several Services
subkeys: AppleTalk, MacFile, MacPrint, and MacSrv. You should let the
system maintain entries in the MacPrint or MacSrv service. However,
the AppleTalk and MacFile services contain definable parameters
described in this section.
<P>
You should use the Network icon in Control Panel to configure SFM, and
use File Manager to administer file services, Server Manager to
administer server services, and Print Manager to administer print
services for SFM.
<P>
SFM is included with Windows NT Advanced Server and on the Windows NT
Resource Guide disk.
<P>
<P><h3>AppleTalk Entries for SFM</h3>
 
<P>
The values for the AppleTalk service are found in the following
Registry path:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\AppleTalk

</PRE>For changes to take effect, you must restart the File Server for
Macintosh using the Devices icon in Control Panel.
<P>
Values for the AppleTalk Parameters and Adapters subkeys are described
here. The settings in the Linkage subkey and the TCP/IP settings in
the Winsock subkey for AppleTalk are maintained by the system and
should not be changed by the user.
<P>
The following are the defaults for the basic service entries:
<P>
<PRE>   DependOnGroup=NDIS
   DependOnService=Lance
   DisplayName=AppleTalk Transport
   ErrorControl=0x1
   ImagePath=\SystemRoot\system32\drivers\sfmatalk.sys
   Start=0x2
   Type=0x1

</PRE><h3>AppleTalk Parameter Entries</h3>
 
<P>
This is the Registry path for the AppleTalk parameters:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\AppleTalk
   \Parameters

   NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for
   readability.

</PRE>These values set port, zone, and router information.
<P>
<PRE>DefaultPort     EG_SZ     Adapter name
   Specifies the network on which the SFM service names are
   registered. If the AppleTalk protocol is not routing, only
   Macintosh workstations connected to this network can see the file
   and print services. During initial installation, the default port
   is set automatically to the first Ethernet adapter found, or to the
   first Token Ring adapter, or to a LocalTalk adapter (in that
   order). Default: the first adapter found.

DesiredZone     REG_SZ     Zone name
   Specifies the zone in which the SFM service is present. If this
   value is not set, SFM is present in the default zone for that
   network. There is no default.

EnableRouter     REG_DWORD     0 or 1
   Tells the AppleTalk protocol whether routing needs to be started on
   this computer. If routing is started, Macintosh workstations
   connected to any of the networks that this computer is on should be
   able to use the file and print servers for Macintosh.

   IMPORTANT: This value is critical. Unless absolutely essential, do
   not set this value to 1.

   Default: 0

</PRE><h3>Adapter Card Entries for AppleTalk</h3>
 
<P>
The entries for AppleTalk that are specific to network adapter cards
are found under the following Registry path:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\AppleTalk\Adapters
   \adapter_name

   NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for
   readability.

</PRE>There is one subkey for each adapter that is AppleTalk-compatible on
the computer. These entries are found in each Adapter_Name subkey.
<P>
<PRE>AarpRetries     REG_DWORD     Number
   Specifies the maximum number of AppleTalk address-resolution
   protocol packets to be sent by the AppleTalk protocol. Default: 0xa

DdpCheckSums     REG_DWORD     0 or 1
   Tells the AppleTalk protocol whether to compute checksums in the
   DDP layer. If this entry is 1, the AppleTalk protocol uses sums in
   the DDP layer. Default: 0

DefaultZone     REG_SZ     Zone name
   Contains the default zone for this network if this adapter is
   seeding the network. If the adapter is seeding the network, the
   default zone is chosen when you configure SFM using the Network
   icon in Control Panel. There is no default.

NetworkRangeLowerEnd     REG_DWORD     1 to 65279
   Specifies the lower network number of the network range if this
   adapter is seeding the network. If the adapter is seeding the
   network, this number is set by using the Network icon in Control
   Panel to configure SFM. There is no default.

NetworkRangeUpperEnd     REG_DWORD     1 to 65279
   Specifies the upper network number of the network range for this
   network if this adapter is seeding the network. If the adapter is
   seeding the network, this number is set by using the Network icon
   in Control Panel to configure SFM. There is no default.

PortName     REG_SZ     AdapterName@ComputerName
   Specifies the name used to identify the AppleTalk protocol running
   on a particular adapter on a computer. There is no default.

SeedingNetwork     REG_DWORD     0 or 1
   Used by the AppleTalk protocol during startup. If this value is 0,
   this adapter is not seeding the network and the AppleTalk protocol
   ignores any seeding information for the adapter, if specified. If
   this value is 1, the AppleTalk protocol reads all seeding
   information and seeds the network, if valid. Default: 0.

ZoneList     REG_MULTI_SZ     List of zones
   This value is relevant only when the adapter is seeding the
   network. The network is seeded with this list of zones by the
   AppleTalk protocol. Changes can be made by using the Network icon
   in Control Panel to configure SFM. There is no default.

</PRE><h3>AppleTalk Winsock Entries</h3>
 
<P>
The TCP/IP settings in the Winsock subkey for AppleTalk are defined by
the system and should not be changed by the user. The following shows
the defaults:
<P>
<PRE>   HelperDllName=C     \winnt\system32\sfmwshat.dll
   Mapping=
   MaxSockAddrLength=0x8
   MinSockAddrLength=0x6

</PRE><h3>MacFile Entries for SFM</h3>
 
<P>
The MacFile subkey contains the main entries for the AppleTalk File
Protocol (AFP) server. All configuration information for the file
server is in the following subkey:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MacFile

</PRE>For changes to take effect, you must restart the computer. The
MacFile\Parameters subkey includes Type_Creators, Icons, and
Extensions subkeys. You should let the system maintain entries in the
Icons or Extensions subkeys. This section describes value entries for
the Parameters and Parameters\Type_Creator subkeys.
<P>
The basic entries for the MacFile services are the following:
<P>
<PRE>   DependOnGroup=
   DependOnService=AppleTalk  LanManWorkStation  NetLogon
   DisplayName=File Server for Macintosh
   ErrorControl=0x1
   ImagePath=%SystemRoot%\system32\sfmsvc.exe
   ObjectName=LocalSystem
   Start=0x2
   Type=0x20

</PRE><h3>MacFile Parameters Entries</h3>
 
<P>
The Registry path for MacFile parameters is the following:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MacFile\Parameters

</PRE>The following value entries specify server options, which can be set
from the Server Manager. All other entries are added to the Registry
when changes to the default values occur.
<P>
For information about the Macintosh codepage, see the entry for MacCP
in the NLS\CodePage subkey.
<P>
<PRE>LoginMsg     REG_SZ     1-198 characters
   Specifies the message you want Macintosh users to see when they log
   on to the Windows NT Advanced Server network. There is no default.

MaxSessions     REG_DWORD     1 to unlimited (0xffffffff)
   Specifies the maximum number of user sessions that the file server
   for Macintosh can accommodate. Default: 0xff  (255 in decimal)

PagedMemLimit     REG_DWORD     1000K to 256000K
   Specifies the maximum amount of page memory that the file server
   for Macintosh uses. Performance of the MacFile service increases
   with an increase in this value. However, the value should not be
   set lower than 1000 KB. It is especially important that you are
   well acquainted with memory issues before changing this resource
   parameter. You cannot change this value from Server Manager.
   Default: 0x4e20 (20000 in decimal).  PagedMemLimit is not a valid
   entry for Windows NT Server version 4.0.

NonPagedMemLimit     REG_DWORD     256K to 16000KB
   Specifies the maximum amount of RAM that is available to the file
   server for Macintosh. Increasing this value helps performance of
   the file server, but decreases performance of other system
   resources. Default: 0xfa0 (4000 in decimal)

ServerName     REG_SZ     Server name
   Specifies the name of the server running SFM on a Windows NT
   Advanced Server network. Use the server's Windows NT Advanced
   Server name as the default if you need to add this entry. There is
   no default.

ServerOptions     REG_DWORD
   Specifies server options that are set in Server Manager. If needed
   for repair purposes, change bits 1 through 3; do not change any of
   the other bits. When on, bit 1 allows guest logons, bit 2 allows
   cleartext passwords, and bit 3 allows Macintosh users to save
   passwords on their workstations. The defaults are bit 1, 2, and 3
   set to on.

Volume     REG_MULTI_SZ    MaxUses  Properties  Password  Path
   Each entry specifies information about a Macintosh-accessible
   volume on the server on a Windows NT Advanced Server network. You
   should add Macintosh-accessible volumes using File Manager.

   Value          Meaning
   ----------------------
   MaxUses        Specifies the maximum number of simultaneous
                  workstations that can be connected to the file
                  server. The upper limit is unlimited. The
                  practical limits are based on the server
                  hardware and network media.
   Properties     Specifies security options. When bit 16 (the leftmost bit
                  in binary notation) is set to On, only guests can use
                  this volume. This is the default (1000000000000000 in
                  binary notation). When bit 1 (the right-most bit in
                  binary notation) is set to On, the volume is read-only. 
                  For both the volume to be read-only and guests to use 
                  this volume, the binary value would be 1000000000000001.
   Password       Contains the encrypted password. Do not change
                  this value. If a user forgets a password, you
                  can delete this entry, thus removing a password
                  requirement from the user's account. Then the
                  user can specify a new password at logon.
   Path           Specifies the path of the volume's root
                  directory. If a volume has been deleted,
                  the path may still be valid; consequently,
                  you should not delete this value. If volumes
                  are deleted using File Manager, you can
                  delete this value.

</PRE><h3>Type_Creators Entries for MacFile</h3>
 
<P>
The values in the following Registry subkey list all the Macintosh
type-creators that are associated with MS-DOS-style filename
extensions:
<P>

   \MacFile\Parameters\Type_Creators

   NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for
   readability.

</PRE>Change these values from the File Manager by choosing the Associate
command from the MacFile menu. The value entries that appear in the
Registry for each type of creator have the following format:
<P>
<PRE>   ##     REG_MULTI_SZ     Creator=Value Type=Value Comment=Value
