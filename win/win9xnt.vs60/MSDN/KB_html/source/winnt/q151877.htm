<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Windows NT may stop responding when older revisions of the DPT PM2124
firmware are used. Other symptoms may also include anomalous behavior of
services or applications that perform disk I/O.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Contact Distributed Processing Technologies or your hardware vendor to
determine whether a firmware upgrade would be appropriate in your
situation.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Older versions of the DPT PM2124 SCSI Adapter firmware have been identified
as having a problem when a flush command is sent and then followed by a
large number of queued requests. When this problem is encountered, the LED
indicators on the adapter scan back and forth, indicating an idle condition
on the SCSI adapter. Yet there are queued requests in the Windows NT I/O
subsystem that are waiting on the adapter to complete the request that
triggered the error condition.
<P>
Because of this "deadlock" situation, disk requests will go unfulfilled and
applications or services which require disk I/O will be blocked. In some
cases, this situation may correct itself one or more times without specific
user intervention, resulting only in degraded system performance and
symptoms similar to a memory leak while I/O is being blocked. Other times,
the system will remain blocked indefinitely, resulting in services and
applications failing one by one until the entire system is blocked. Even
the keyboard and mouse may eventually stop responding. It is interesting to
note, however, that the very lowest level network drivers may still be
running. This means, for example, that if TCP/IP is used on the system, it
will still be possible to PING the system, but higher level protocols will
no longer function.
