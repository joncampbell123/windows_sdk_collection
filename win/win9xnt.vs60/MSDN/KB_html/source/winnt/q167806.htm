The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
There are several advanced options and preferences that can be configured
in the Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) Manager that affect the way
the WINS server performs and displays data.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In WINS Manager, on the Server menu, click Configuration, and then click
Advanced to access the following settings:
<P>
Logging Enabled - when enabled, WINS will log all changes to the Jet.log
file in the path specified by the following registry key:
<P>
<PRE>  "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Wins\
   Parameters\LogFilePath"

  By default, this is set to %SystemRoot%\System32\WINS.

</PRE>Log Detailed Events - when enabled, WINS event log entries will have
detailed information, but may affect performance since it is very resource
intensive.
<P>
Replicate Only With Partners - this option specifies that the WINS server
should only replicate with Push or Pull partners. Without this option
selected, an administrator can request replication with a WINS server that
is not a Push or Pull partner.
<P>
Backup On Termination - this option automatically performs a backup of the
WINS database when the WINS Service is stopped, but not when the system is
shut down.
<P>
Migrate On/Off - when enabled, static records are treated as dynamic when
they conflict with a new registration or replication. This means that if
the static entry is no longer valid, the new record will overwrite it.
Select this option if you are upgrading non-WINS clients to become WINS
clients.
<P>
Starting Version Count - set this value to a number higher than the
version number that appears for replication of this WINS server's records
on its remote partners, if this server has to restart. This will force the
remote partners to replicate the new records.
<P>
Database Backup Path - specifies the location for the backup of the WINS
database. If you specify a path, WINS automatically performs a full backup
of its database to the Wins_bak folder within this folder every 24 hours.
Do not specify a network drive. WINS uses this location to automatically
restore the database in the event that the database is found to be
corrupted when WINS is started.
<P>
<P><h3>Click Options and select Preferences to access the following settings:</h3>
 
<P>
Address Display - this setting specifies how the mappings will be
displayed in the database window.
<P>
Server Statistics - this setting specifies how often to update the server
statistics.
<P>
Computer Names - When selected, the mappings in the database window will
display the 16th character (1B, 1C, 1E, etc) of each record.
<P>
Validate Cache Of Known WINS Servers At Startup Time - this setting causes
WINS to query the list of servers to find available servers when the
service starts.
<P>
Confirm Deletion of Static Mappings And Cached WINS Servers - this setting
specifies whether to generate a warning message when deleting a static
mapping or a cached WINS server.
<P>
New Pull Partner Default Configuration - these settings specify the
default settings for new Pull partners.
<P>
New Push Partner Default Configuration - these settings specify the
default settings for new Push partners.
