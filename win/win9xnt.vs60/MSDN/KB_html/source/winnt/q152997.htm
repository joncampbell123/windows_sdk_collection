Micro Solutions currently has Windows NT support available in beta form for
Backpack CD-ROM drives. Only Backpack models 163550/163700 (double speed)
and 164550/164700 (quad speed) are supported. This driver will allow
installation of Windows NT and Backpack CD-ROM drive usage on Windows NT
workstations. This driver is not intended for use under Windows 95.
<P>
The Backpack "16-bit Built-in Sound Board" is not supported under Windows
NT. There are no current plans to provide Windows NT support for the
Backpack Sound Board.
