The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 and 3.51
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When establishing a trust between two domains, if there is a session
already established between the two domain controllers the following
message appears on the Windows NT 3.x domain controller:
<P>
<PRE>   The trust relationship between XXXX and YYYY could not be verified at
   this time. If you find that it was not established, contact the
   administrator of the XXXX domain and verify that it has been permitted
   YYYY to trust.

</PRE>On a Windows NT 4.0 domain controller, the following error message
appears:
<P>
<PRE>   The trust relationship can not be verified because this machine has
   a session open to &lt;computer name&gt;, the Primary Domain Controller of
   domain XXXX. Do you wish to continue setting up the trust relationship?

</PRE>(&lt;computer name&gt; is the machine name for the PDC, XXXX is the trusted
domain, and YYYYY is the trusting domain.)
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The trust may have been established and may be working correctly. The
reason this message appears is that there was already a session established
between the domain controllers under a user account (specifically, the
session would have to have been established from YYYY to XXXX). This
session keeps the special trust verification from being sent because the
Windows NT redirector (LanmanWorkstation) can establish remote sessions
under only one user account per remote server.
