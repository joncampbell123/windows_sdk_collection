<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Services for Macintosh (SFM) files with names containing characters illegal
under Windows NT lose their long names when backed up and restored using
Windows NT Backup.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The legal SFM characters, but illegal Windows NT characters, are supported
by Services for Macintosh by translating the characters to an unused area
of the Unicode character set. Prior to Service Pack 2, Windows NT Backup
did not support Unicode. When a version of Windows NT Backup that is not
Unicode aware backs one of these files it is unable to record the correct
long filename. In instead uses a traditional 8.3 character filename. As a
result, the long filename is unrecoverable.
<P>
NOTE: Tapes created by Windows NT Backup from Service Pack 2 or later
record the long filenames correctly.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
This problem has been corrected in Windows NT version 3.5 and the most
current builds of Windows NT version 3.1.  Because the data recorded to the
tape from earlier versions of Windows NT Backup does not contain the full
file names, there is no way to recover from the loss of this information;
the files must be renamed from the Macintosh client to regain their
original names.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version
3.1. This problem was corrected in the latest US Service Pack for
Windows NT. For information on obtaining this update, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

spaces.
