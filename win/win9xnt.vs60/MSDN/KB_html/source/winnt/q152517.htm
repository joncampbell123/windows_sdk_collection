<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you have Windows NT installed on the first primary partition formatted
as NTFS, and you chose to reformat the partition as NTFS during Setup to
start with a clean partition, the Windows NT setup program will reformat
the partition as FAT, copy files from the CD-ROM, and then try to reboot
the computer in GUI mode to continue the installation.
At this point the computer will either stop responding or display the
following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   DISK READ ERROR OCCURED.

</PRE>If you boot from an MS-DOS disk and run scandisk C: you will encounter the
following:
<P>
<PRE>   The media descriptor byte is invalid.
   FAT copies are not the same.
   Many crosslinked files.
   All directory entries were invalid.

</PRE>Trying to repair the partition does not resolve the corruption, nor does it
allow the installation to resume.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Windows NT always reformats the partition you want to install on using the
FAT file system, then performs a conversion to NTFS on the final re-boot
after Windows NT is finished setting up. When you choose to reformat the
system boot partition as NTFS, Setup is inadvertently writing the 16 sector
NTFS boot area over the top of the freshly formatted FAT drive after the
file copying portion of text mode setup is complete.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 

<UL><LI>During Setup, choose to delete the Primary NTFS Boot partition , then
   re-create the partition and choose to format it NTFS.
<P>
</UL>OR

<UL><LI>Select the FAT file system to set up Windows NT on. After Windows NT is
   set up, perform a manual conversion to NTFS as follows:
<P>
<P><PRE>      convert c: /fs:ntfs
</PRE><P>
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.50
and 3.51 We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
