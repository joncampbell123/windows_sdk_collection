The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5 and 3.51
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5 and 3.51
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs on an NE3200 Network card that has had a Locally
Administered Address (LAA) assigned to it.
<P>
If an adapter reset is issued to the card, the card will no longer accept
packets sent to its LAA. However, it will still transmit packets using its
LAA and will still process any broadcast/multicast packets that it sees.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs because the LAA is not correctly rewritten to the
adapter after an NdisReset is issued.
<P>
This problem only occurs with the NDIS 3.0 miniport driver included with
Windows NT 3.5 and 3.51. The non-miniport driver included with Windows NT
3.1 does not have this problem.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To correct this problem, upgrade to Windows NT 3.51 (if you have not
already done so) and install the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT
version 3.51.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.5 and
3.51. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Windows NT version 3.51. For information on obtaining the Service Pack,
query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
