<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the Spry Air TCP protocol and Spry Air Dialer version 3.0 to
connect to a Windows NT version 3.5 Remote Access Service (RAS) server, the
connection fails.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Windows NT RAS uses password authentication protocol (PAP) or challenge-
handshake authentication protocol (CHAP) for password authentication of
third-party RAS client software. Since Spry remote access software does not
use PAP or CHAP, it cannot be authenticated by a Windows NT RAS server.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
As a registered user of Spry's Internet In A Box product, you can obtain an
update which will fix the problem noted above. The update is version 1.0a
and includes Air Dialer version 03.0a.01.08. The WINSOCK.DLL file is dated
12/6/94 with a file size of 123,328 bytes.
<P>
NOTE: You can check to see if you have the correct version of Air Dialer by
looking at the serial number. If you do, the serial number should look
like: IBX10-RT6&lt;xxxxxxx&gt; (where &lt;xxxxxxx&gt; is the unique serial number of
your product).
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following information was taken from a technical note provided by Spry:
<P>
The maintenance release for Internet In A Box is now available to all
registered owners of the product. You may download it from our ftp server
by following the directions below. If you wish, you may also obtain the
release on diskette for an $8.95 shipping and handling fee by calling the
SPRY, Inc. technical support department at 1-206-447-0958.
<P>
REQUIREMENTS: A working installation of version 1.0
<P>
PROCEDURE:

<OL><P><LI>Start Internet In A Box's Network File Manager application. If
    you are unfamiliar with this application, you may wish to
    review pages 101-144 of The Whole Internet Users Guide included
    with your package.

<P><LI>In the "Host" field, type support.spry.com (this should
    also be in the drop-down selections).

<P><LI>In the "User Name" field, type anonymous.

<P><LI>In the "Password" field, type your e-mail address.

<P><LI>Leave the "Account" field empty.

<P><LI>In the "Host Type" field, use the drop-down selections to choose
    Unix.

<P><LI>When all this information is complete click the "OK" button.

<P><LI>This will start the dialer and connect you to support.spry.com.

<P><LI>If you have ever connected to support.spry.com before, you
    will enter the ftp directories at the place you last exited
    from. This can be determined by the small blue arrow pointing
    "up" in the upper left corner of the directory listing. Please
    see the table 6-1 on page 109 of The Whole Internet Users
    Guide for further explanation of this symbol.

<P><LI>Once connected to support.spry.com, you will see the directory
    listing and the item IBOXPATCH. Double click on IBOXPATCH.

<P><LI>This will take you to another directory. Double click on the
    file name READIBOX.TXT. This will open the file so you may
    read it. You may prefer to print this file for future
    reference, or click and drag this to your local drive to save.

<P><LI>The patch itself is called ALL_IBOX.EXE. Click and drag this
    to your local drive. Do the same for either IBOX.TXT
    (documentation in text format) or IBOX.DOC (documentation in
    Word for Windows 6.0 format).

<P><LI>Follow the directions in the file READIBOX.TXT to install the
    upgraded files.
