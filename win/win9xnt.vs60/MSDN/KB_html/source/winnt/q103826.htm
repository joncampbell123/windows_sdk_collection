The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Windows NT does not properly store passwords with extended characters
in the Microsoft LAN Manager-compatible password entry in the Security
Accounts Manager (SAM) database. This may cause your Microsoft LAN
Manager, Remote Access Service (RAS), or Macintosh clients to fail
authentication if their passwords contain extended characters.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Each user account has two passwords, both a LAN Manager and a Windows
NT-compatible password. Each password is doubly encrypted and stored
in the SAM database. The two passwords enable Windows NT to validate
your account for both Windows NT and LAN Manager clients.
<P>
LAN Manager passwords are not case-sensitive. Before they are
encrypted, they are converted to all uppercase letters. Windows NT has
no way of making an extended character uppercase in a consistant
manner due to the differences in foreign languages and code pages.
Because of this, Windows NT stores only makes non-extended characters
uppercase; it leaves extended characters alone.
<P>
Because Windows NT handles extended characters in this manner, your
password may not match up with the one stored on a LAN Manager client.
<P>
NOTE: This problem only occurs when a password is originally created
from Windows NT User Manager or during initial logon. If the password
is created by using the LAN Manager client NET PASSWORD command, it is
stored properly in the Windows NT SAM database. Also, if the password
is created with PORTUAS, it should be all right.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT and Windows NT
Advanced Server version 3.1, and Windows NT Workstation and Server versions
3.1.We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
