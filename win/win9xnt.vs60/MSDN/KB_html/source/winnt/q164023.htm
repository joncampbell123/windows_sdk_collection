The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When a Windows Sockets application calls gethostbyname() to resolve the
local hostname to a list of IP addresses on a multihomed computer, the list
may be returned in an order that does not match the binding order displayed
in Control Panel, or the order that IP addresses were assigned to network
interface cards (NICs).
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Changes made to support Windows Sockets 2 produced this behavior.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this problem, obtain the following fix or wait for the next
Windows NT service pack.
<P>
This fix should have the following time stamp:
<P>
<PRE>   10/07/97  11:51a                72,464 Mswsock.dll (Intel)
   10/07/97  11:51a                40,720 Rnr20.dll   (Intel)
   10/13/97  04:01p                20,240 Wsock32.dll (Intel)

   10/07/97  10:49a               115,472 Mswsock.dll (Alpha)
   10/07/97  10:49a                67,856 Rnr20.dll   (Alpha)
   10/13/97  02:59p                24,848 Wsock32.dll (Alpha)

</PRE>When the new fix is applied, and gethostbyname() is used to resolve the
local hostname on a multihomed computer, the list of IP addresses will be
returned in the following order:

<UL><LI>The first address from each NIC in the system. You can see the order in
   which they will appear by clicking the Bindings tab in the Control
   Panel Network tool.

<LI>The remainder of the IP addresses from each NIC. You can see the order
   in which they will appear by clicking the Bindings tab in the Control
   Panel Network tool.

<LI>Additional addresses, such as those dynmically assumed by a cluster
   server.
<P>
</UL>So if you had a computer similar to the following:
<P>
<PRE>   Card A - Addresses 1,2,3
   Card B - Addresses 4,5,6

</PRE>The order returned would be 1,4,2,3,5,6. That is, the first address from
each NIC (1,4) and then the remainder from each NIC (2,3,5,6).
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0.
A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression tested
and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem.
Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix.
Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
