The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If you need to:
<P>
- reinstall  Windows NT over an existing installation (a clean install, not
<PRE>  an upgrade)

</PRE>- move all of your data drives from one server to another
<P>
- install Windows NT to another directory or drive on a computer that
<PRE>  already has Windows NT installed

</PRE>you can save the share names that exist on the original Windows NT
installation, including any permissions assigned to those shares.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them.
Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of
Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.
<P>
To save only the existing share names and their permissions on Windows NT
follow these steps:
<P>
NOTE: This procedure applies only to NetBIOS shares and not Macintosh
volumes.

<OL><P><LI>On the existing Windows NT installation containing the share names and
   permissions that you want to save, run the Registry Editor
   (Regedt32.exe).

<P><LI>From the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following key:
<P>
<P><PRE>      SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Shares
</PRE>
<P><LI>Choose Save Key from the Registry menu.

<P><LI>Type a new file name (a file extension is not necessary) and save the
   file to a floppy disk).

<P><LI>Reinstall Windows NT

<P><LI>Run Registry Editor. (Regedt32.exe)

<P><LI>From the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following key:
<P>
<P><PRE>      SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Shares
</PRE>
<P><LI>From the Registry menu choose Restore.

<P><LI>Type the path and file name of the file that you saved in steps 3 and 4.
<P>
   CAUTION: This step overrides whatever shares already exist on the
   Windows NT machine with the share names and permissions that exist in
   the file you are restoring. You are warned about this before restoring
   the key.
<P>
   NOTE: If, after completing the procedure above, you decide that you
   should not have restored the Shares key, restart the computer and press
   the Spacebar to use the Last Known Good Configuration.
<P>
</OL>After restoring the shares key, the shares can be used by network clients.
Although running NET SHARES on the server displays the shares, File Manager
does not. To make File Manager aware of the newly restored shares, create
any new share on the server. File Manager will then display all of the
other shares after you reboot the server or stop and re-start the Server
service.
<P>
In Windows NT 3.5, if you choose "Stop Sharing" in file manager, the
restored shares will still show up, but they are grayed out.
<P>
Only permissions for domain users are restored. If a local user was created
in the previous Windows NT installation, that local user's unique security
identifier (SID) is lost.
<P>
NTFS permissions on directories and files are not affected when you save
and restore the shares key.
