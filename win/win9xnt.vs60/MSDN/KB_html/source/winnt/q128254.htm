<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you add users and groups to an Windows NT version 3.5 computer using
User Manager you have the ability to overrun the registry with user and
group information. When you reboot your computer, the following stop screen
appears:
<P>
<PRE>   Stop 0xc0000218 (0xe11a30e8, 0x00000000, 0x000000000, 0x00000000)
   Unknown Hard Error

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
User accounts and group information are stored in a secure location in the
registry. By default, RSL (registry size limit) is 25% of the size of paged
pool. The registry charges registry quota for its memory allocations. This
is to prevent the registry from becoming too large for the available system
resources. If a piece of registry is freed up, it is deallocated from the
pool and the registry quota is returned. Although the space is still
allocated in the file, there is no memory allocated, so no quota is
charged.
<P>
If the registry becomes very fragmented, its file size may become much
larger than the charged registry quota, potentially causing the registry to
become larger than the system can accommodate at boot time. That is, the
registry file cannot fit in memory in the available paged pool.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To address fragmentation, the Windows NT registry now continues to charge
quota for portions of the registry that have been deallocated from pool,
but are still allocated in the file. This prevents the size of the
registry's files from exceeding the allowable registry quota, ensuring the
file will fit in memory on the next reboot.
<P>
Additionally, a change was made that provides better coalescing of small
portions of free registry memory into larger pieces when very large
registry allocations are required.
<P>
With this change, instead of overrunning the registry with user and group
information, when the registry reaches it's maximum allocation the
following error message appears:
<P>
<PRE>   Not enough server storage to process this command

   TITLE     : Err Msg: Not Enough Server Storage is Available to Process..

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5.
This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows
NT version 3.5. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
