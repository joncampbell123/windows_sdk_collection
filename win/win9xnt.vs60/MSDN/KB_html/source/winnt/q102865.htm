The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
</UL>

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
CorelDRAW encounters the following problems when printing to a
PostScript printer and running with Windows NT:

<UL><LI>If TrueType fonts are printed over a graphic, a white rectangle may
   be displayed behind the characters.

<LI>Non-clipped shaded text does not print.

<LI>Performance during print fills is too slow.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
These problems occur because CorelDRAW running with NT cannot
determine that it is printing to PostScript; therefore, CorelDRAW
defaults to a non-PostScript printer and tries to read the file from
the printer device context surface.
<P>
The white rectangle appears when CorelDRAW tries to block transfer
from the printer device context surface to a memory bitmap, block
transfer the character on top of the bitmap, then block transfer the
complete image back to the printer device context surface.
<P>
CorelDRAW creates non-clipped shaded text by adding the shaded
rectangle to the surface, then XORing (exclusive ORing) on top to
erase the background. CorelDRAW does this because it does not know it
is printing to a PostScript printer, which cannot complete XOR
functions.
<P>
Poor performance printing fills also stem from this problem. Fills
normally are sent to a PostScript device as the area fills, which is
extremely quickly. The NT PostScript device is sent bit-block
transfers, which are extremely slow.
<P>
NOTE: Poor printing fills are not a problem with the Win31 PostScript
printer driver.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
There currently are no workarounds for these problems.
<P>
CorelDRAW is manufactured by Corel Corporation, a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this
