The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
The Windows NT Emergency Repair disk may not be able to repair some of
the Windows NT system files if additional drivers or third-party
system files are added after installation.
<P>
The Emergency Repair disk uses a file called REPAIR.INF to store
information about an installation. The names, location, and checksum
of each Windows NT file copied to the system during installation are
stored within this file. This data is used in the event of a repair to
verify the integrity of each Windows NT file. If a discrepancy is
encountered, the file is copied from the original disks or CD-ROM.
<P>
If an additional driver or software is loaded after the initial
installation of Windows NT, the Emergency Repair disk will be unable
to verify these files. Troubleshooting and replacement of such files
must be done manually, rather than with the Emergency Repair disk.
<P>
For example, if you add a third-party display driver or printer driver
after installation, the Emergency Repair disk will not have
information on these files and will not be able to verify them.
<P>
Files that may be affected by this include drivers for audio adapters,
printer drivers, display drivers, network adapter drivers, and any
other software that requires new files to be copied to the system
after the initial installation.
