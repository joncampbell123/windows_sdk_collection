<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Windows NT, when the static Drive Letter in Disk Administrator
is changed on the logical drive that Windows NT is presently installed on,
you will receive one of the following error messages, or a combination of
the messages:
<P>
<PRE>   Winlogon.exe-Drive not ready
   The drive is not ready for use; its door may be open. Please
   check drive [C:] and make sure that a disk is inserted and that
   the drive door is closed.

   -or-

   Winlogin.exe-No Disk
   There is no disk in the drive. Please insert a disk into drive [C:]

   -or-

   System Error
   Cannot read from drive [C:]

</PRE><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Change the drive letter in Disk Administrator back to it’s original
logical drive letter assignment.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Assignment of drive letters affects only the way the device drivers
assign drive letters to disks attached to the system. It does not
remap any existing references to drive letters. Additionally, there
may be active system processes that cannot be stopped in order to
change the drive letter references.
<P>
Static drive letter assignment is useful in the following cases:

<UL><LI>To snapshot the existing drive letter assignments, so that new disks
   can be added to the system without changing the drive letter
   assignments of the existing disks.

<LI>To assign a particular drive letter to an existing volume. The
   former case allows the user to add new disks without having to change
   environment variables, page file location, .INI files, or application
   initialization data stored in the registry. However, in the second
   case, the user (who must be an administrator) is responsible for
   updating all references to the drive.
