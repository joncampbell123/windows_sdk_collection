<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After you install ICMP-fix, the following events may be logged in the
system event log:

<UL><LI>Event ID: 4199
   Source: TCP/IP
   Description: The system detected an address conflict for IP address
   0.0.0.0 with the system having network hardware address
   xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx. Network operations on this system may be disrupted as
   a result.

<LI>Event ID: 26
   Source: Applications Popup
<P>
</UL>For more information on ICMP-fix, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../winnt/q143478.htm">Q143478</A></B>
   TITLE     : Stop 0A in TCPIP.SYS When Receiving Out Of Band (OOB) Data

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The ICMP hotfix includes a fix where ARP requests sent from 0.0.0.0 are now
processed. The handling of ARP requests sent from 0.0.0.0 has been
introduced because RFC 1541 suggests that a DHCP client should verify an IP
lease offered from a DHCP server by sending an ARP request. In the RFC, the
sender's IP address is defined as 0.0.0.0.
<P>
If a computer is in a state where it has no valid IP address lease (for
example, when starting or when the lease has expired), the computer's
TCP/IP stack is initialized with the address 0.0.0.0.
<P>
If, in this state, an ARP request with sender's IP address 0.0.0.0 is
received, the above events will be logged.
<P>
For additional information on the ICMP hotfix, please see the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
