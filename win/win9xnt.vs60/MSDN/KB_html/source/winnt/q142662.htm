The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The Computer Profile Setup (CPS) utility in the Windows NT Resource Kit
allows you to set up Windows NT Workstation or Windows NT Server on
multiple, identical x86-based computers. However, when you try to duplicate
a Windows NT Server that has Windows Internet Naming Service (WINS), CPS
fails to set up a Windows NT Server with WINS.
<P>
CPS uses two utilities: one to make a copy of an installed Windows NT
system and one to set up new Windows NT systems using this copy. When CPS
is used to duplicate a Windows NT Server system with WINS installed, the
WINS service fails to start on the newly installed Windows NT servers and
WINS has to be reinstalled.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is due to the fact that a WINS database built on a particular
system cannot be used on another system with another IP address. Therefore
CPS does not copy the Wins.mdb file on the target platform.
<P>
For additional information, please see the following article(s) in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../winnt/q140971.htm">Q140971</A></B>
   TITLE     : WINS Service Generates a System Error 1 Incorrect Function

</PRE><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
The following workaround allows you to set up a fresh installation of WINS
along with CPS.

<OL><P><LI>Install a Windows NT 3.51 Server with WINS service.

<P><LI>Copy the Resource Kit CPS files under C:\CPS.

<P><LI>Modify C:\Cps\Profile.ini as required.

<P><LI>Run C:\Cps\Uplodprf -s:X:\FLAT, where X:\FLAT is the directory used for
   future installations.

<P><LI>Remove all WINS files in the flat:
<P>
<P><PRE>       del X:\FLAT\WINNT35.0\SYSTEM32\WINS\*.*
</PRE>
<P><LI>Insert Windows NT Server distribution compact disc in the CD-ROM (in the
   example below it is drive D) and carry out the following commands :
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy D:\I386\SYSTEM.MD_  X:\FLAT\WINNT35.0\SYSTEM32\WINS
      X:
      cd \FLAT\WINNT35.0\SYSTEM32\WINS
      attrib -r SYSTEM.MD_
      expand -r SYSTEM.MD_
      del X:\FLAT\WINNT35.0\SYSTEM32\WINS\SYSTEM.MD_
</PRE><P>
</OL>This will restore the distribution file System.mdb. When WINS is installed
on a server, the System.mdb distribution file is copied to
%SystemRoot%\System32\WINS and a new Wins.mdb database file is created the
first time the WINS server attempts to start.

<OL><P><LI>Modify Dosnet.inf as follows:
<P>
</OL>NOTE: Because some files have been removed from the WINS subdirectory, the
Dosnet.inf file included in X:\FLAT must be modified so that you are
not prompted with an error message stating that these files could not be
copied.
<P>
<PRE>   Edit X:\FLAT\DOSNET.INF and remove the following three lines :

      d10,Jet.log
      d10,winstmp.mdb
      d10,wins.mdb

</PRE><P><LI>Run WINNTP on the target platform.
<P>
</OL>WINS will be installed on the target platform and a new WINS database will
be created. If you need to use the WINS entries of the master server, you
need to configure pull/push partners.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows NT
version 3.51. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
