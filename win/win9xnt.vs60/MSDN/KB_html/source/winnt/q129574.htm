SUMMARY
 
<P>
When Windows NT automatically adjusts for daylight savings time, the times
on files on Windows NT file system (NTFS) partitions and the events in the
event logs are retroactively shifted by one hour, even though the files
and event records were created before the daylight savings time change.
<P>
NOTE: To configure Windows NT to automatically adjust for daylight savings
time, run Control Panel, choose Date/Time, and select "Automatically
Adjust for Daylight Saving Time."
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs because of the way that Windows NT stores time
information. All times displayed in Windows NT for event log events and
files on NTFS partitions are computed as offsets to Greenwich Mean Time
(GMT). When you set the time on your system, you are setting the value for
GMT. When you select your local time zone for the system, the appropriate
number of hours are added or subtracted to the stored GMT value. This
adjusted time is displayed. When "Automatically Adjust for Daylight Saving
Time" is selected, an additional hour is added to GMT during daylight
savings time (the first Sunday in April through the last Sunday in
October).
<P>
If you are viewing another machine remotely across one or more time zones
through Event Viewer, the times for events on the remote system appear
relative to your local time. In other words, if you are viewing an event
remotely that actually occurred at 8:00 PM Central Daylight Time, the time
displayed for the event on your computer will be 6:00 PM when you view the
event from the Pacific Daylight Time zone.
<P>
When Windows95 or Windows NT clients access network resources they are
passed the GMT time of the file stored on the NTFS partition. When the
client recieves the time stamp in GMT they then adjust the time stamp (+)
plus or (-) minus the time zone they are set for.
<P>
In the case of WINDOWS NT - it also adjusts for daylight savings time and
displays the file's time stamp for the correct local time including
Daylight Savings Time setting.
<P>
<P>
In the case of WINDOWS95 - The time returned by the file system is not
adjusted for Daylight Savings Time. This feature is by design, and was
implemented to work with servers such as NetWare that do not support the
Daylight Savings time APIs and time functions in Windows 95. In this case
the files will display off by one hour. this is BY DESIGN for WINDOWS95
clients.
