The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The InterNIC provides a service to search for information on second-level
domains including contact e-mail addresses, postal addresses, and telephone
numbers that are registered with the InterNIC. The service is available
through the WHOIS search from the InterNIC web site, WHOIS clients,
interactive telnet sessions, and e-mail. The InterNIC database provides
information about .com, .gov, .net, .edu, and .org domains.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The WHOIS service is an online database. It has information on sites,
networks, networking organizations, domains, and the associated contacts.
This is known as the InterNIC database. As applications are processed with
domain or IP number by the InterNIC, the names of the administrative and
technical contacts for registered domains are entered into the database.
The information in the InterNIC database can be valuable in resolving
problems between two domains.
<P>
For example, WHOIS can help determine who to contact if there is a problem
with Domain Name Service (DNS) zone transfers that cannot be resolved.
WHOIS can show the DNS Server administrator the name and phone number of
the administrator at a destination host.
<P>
NOTE: There can be a delay between the time when information is modified on
the Internet root servers and when information is modified on the WHOIS
server. For this reason, you may wish to direct queries to the root servers
themselves via Nslookup or Dig to confirm information obtained via WHOIS.
<P>
<P><h3>WHOIS Client</h3>
 
<P>
The WHOIS client program accesses the InterNIC database directly and is
usually included with UNIX systems. There are also clients available for
other platforms including Windows and Windows NT.
<P>
If you have shell account access to the Internet that includes the WHOIS
client, type the following:
<P>
<PRE>   whois domain.com

</PRE>where domain.com is the name of the Internet domain of the host that you
are interested in.
<P>
NOTE: The InterNIC registers secondary domain names only. For best results,
do not include Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) on the query. FQDNs
include the higher level domains associated with an Internet site. Only
secondary domain names will return contact information.
<P>
Example:
<P>
<PRE>   Incorrect:  www.microsoft.com
   Correct:    microsoft.com

</PRE><h3>Direct Telnet Session</h3>
 
<P>
All systems that have access to the Internet must have the ability to use
a standard telnet client to connect to the InterNIC to run the WHOIS client
from their system. Networks that restrict access to the Internet through
use of a firewall will not be able to use this method if TCP port 23
(standard telnet port) access is blocked.
<P>
Microsoft Exchange Server administrators may run the Windows NT Telnet
client from the computer that is running the IMC. Any telnet client from
any host connected to the Internet should work.
<P>
In telnet, connect to internic.net. Once connected you can run WHOIS
commands as listed in the client instructions given earlier.
<P>
<P><h3>World Wide Web</h3>
 
<P>
The Web Interface to WHOIS is a searchable database through a web page. To
access with any World Wide Web (WWW) client, connect to:
<P>
<PRE>   <B>http://rs.internic.net/cgi-bin/whois</B>

</PRE><h3>Electronic Mail</h3>
 
<P>
If you are unable to access the methods above but have access to Internet
mail you can send your query to:
<P>
<PRE>   mailserv@internic.net

</PRE>Enter your command in the subject line or as the first line of the body of
the message. All other text is ignored. You must prefix your command with
the word WHOIS just like the client examples given earlier. Requests
through electronic mail are processed automatically once per day.
<P>
<P><h3>Other Top Level Domains</h3>
 
<P>
The InterNIC provides registration information for .com, .edu, .net, .org,
and .gov domains only. However, the WHOIS client works with other top-level
domains. Top level domains that do not provide compatibility with WHOIS may
provide other tools to research domains.
