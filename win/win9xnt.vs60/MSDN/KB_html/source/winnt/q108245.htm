<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Pro Tel for Windows, Advanced PCB, by Pro Tel Technologies does not work at
all in Windows NT. Advanced PCB employs a copy protection device known as a
hardware key or "dongle." This type of copy protection device is currently
not compatible with Windows NT version 3.1. With this device installed on
your system’s parallel port, you cannot activate the Advanced PCB
application.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Pro Tel for Windows Advanced PCB is a design tool for high-end CAD systems
which are used to design printed circuit boards (PCBs). The program does
not start unless the copy protection hardware key, or dongle, is installed
on the parallel port. Because hardware keys are not currently supported in
Windows NT version 3.1, Advanced PCB doesn't activate under Windows NT even
when the key is properly installed.
<P>
The principle behind a hardware key, or dongle, is that each legitimate
copy of a software application will also be sold with a hardware key. The
software will use special code to interrogate the key for the correct
serial number associated with the purchased product. Hence, unauthorized
copies of the software will be detected immediately. Functionally, the
dongle acts as a pass-through for any other device connected to the
computer's port.
<P>
Pro Tel Technologies also markets another Pro Tel for Windows product,
Advanced Schematics, which does not require a hardware key for operation.
According to Pro Tel, this product does function correctly under Windows
NT. The technical support number for Pro Tel Technologies is (800) 544-
4186. The company’s mailing address is: 4675 Stevens Creek Blvd., Santa
Clara, CA, 95051.
<P>
The Pro Tel products included here are manufactured by a vendor independent
of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these
products’ performance or reliability.
