The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
A multiprocessor computer running Microsoft Windows NT version 4.0 may
appear to stop responding (hang) when subjected to heavy TCP/IP stress. The
system will continue to respond to PINGs, but higher level TCP/IP activity
will be blocked. If other network protocols are installed, the system may
continue to function normally except for activities that depend on TCP/IP.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
For this problem to occur, a process must have an open handle to an address
and an open handle to a connection and must try to close both
simultaneously (as, for example, might happen at process termination).
Under very specific and timing-dependent situations, Tcpip.sys can become
deadlocked, blocking further work by the driver. When this happens, other
parts of the system will typically continue running for a period of minutes
or longer until higher level services that depend on Tcpip.sys also become
blocked, waiting for the driver.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Obtain the following fix or wait for the next Windows NT service pack.
<P>
This fix should have the following timestamp:
<P>
<PRE>   11/21/97  03:45 PM               143,408 Tcpip.sys  (Intel)
   11/21/97  03:42 PM               263,248 Tcpip.sys  (Alpha)

</PRE>NOTE: Service Pack 3 must be applied to Windows NT 4.0 prior to applying
this fix.
<P>
NOTE: This hotfix is superseded by the fix referred to in the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../winnt/q179129.htm">Q179129</A></B>
   TITLE     : STOP 0x0000000A or 0x00000019 Due to Modified Teardrop
               Attack

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0.
A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression tested
and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem.
Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix.
Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
