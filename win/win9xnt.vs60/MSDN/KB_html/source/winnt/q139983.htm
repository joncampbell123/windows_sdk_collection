<P><h2>Summary</h2>
 
<P>
Windows NT Remote Access Service (RAS) routing for LAN connectivity to an
Internet Provider requires an IP subnet address for the local LAN and a
different subnet addresses for the RAS link. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../winnt/q121877.htm">Q121877</A></B>
   TITLE     : Using RAS for Routing of IP Packets

</PRE>This article describes subnetting options with a class C address. A class
"C" address must be registered with the InterNIC. The InterNIC can be found
at <B>http://rs.internic.net</B> or by sending mail to Hostmaster@NIC.DDN.MIL .
Your Internet Service Provider may also supply you with a valid range of
addresses.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Following are 3 options to configure different subnet addresses for the RAS
link and local LAN:
<P>
<P><h3>Option 1</h3>
 
<P>
Have the Internet Provider give you one address to use on your RAS link
outside of your class C addresses. This leaves you with the full 254
addresses for your own use and no special subnetting. Many Internet
Providers will not give you an additional IP address. They may give you an
entire additional class C range for a fee.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Option 2</h3>
 
<P>
Subnet mask of 255.255.255.192
<P>
This gives you 2 valid subnets with a maximum of 62 clients on the local
LAN. Subnet 1 would have the fourth octet of 64-127 (65-126 can be
assigned). Subnet 2 would have the fourth octet of 128-191 (129-190 can be
assigned). For example XXX.XXX.XXX.65 would be the first address of subnet
1 and could be used for the Windows NT network card and XXX.XXX.XXX.129
would be the first address of subnet 2 and could be used for the RAS
connection.
<P>
NOTE: The subnets of 0-63 and 192-255 are technically invalid.
<P>
<P><h3>Option 3 (unsupported)</h3>
 
<P>
Subnet mask of 255.255.255.128.
<P>
This gives you 2 subnets with a maximum of 126 clients on the Local LAN.
Both subnets are technically invalid but work with Windows NT 3.5 and 3.51.
Be sure all clients on the network support this subnet mask. Microsoft
cannot guarantee this will work in future releases of Windows NT. Subnet 1
would have the fourth octet of 0-127 (1-126 can be assigned). Subnet 2
would have the fourth octet of 128-255 (129-254 can be assigned). For
example XXX.XXX.XXX.1 is the first address of subnet 1 and could be
used for the Windows NT network card and XXX.XXX.XXX.129 is the first
address of subnet 2 and could be used for the RAS connection.
