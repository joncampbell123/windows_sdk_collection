</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article discusses the Presentation Manager (PM) subsystem for Windows
NT. It is divided into these parts:

<UL><LI>What is the PM Subsystem?
<LI>Using the PM Subsystem
<LI>Services Offered by the PM Subsystem
<P>
</UL><h3>What is the PM Subsystem?</h3>
 
<P>
The PM subsystem enables users to run 16-bit OS/2 Presentation Manager
applications under Windows NT with no code changes needed. It enables ISVs
and OEMs who have invested in developing PM applications for OS/2 1.2 and
1.3 to run their applications under Windows NT. The current release of the
PM subsystem will only work with version 3.1 of Windows NT and Windows NT
Advanced Server.
<P>
<P><h3>Using the PM Subsystem</h3>
 
<P>
The PM subsystem is started by running PMSHELL.EXE. PMSHELL.EXE must be
executed before any PM applications can be run. The PM subsystem will not
start automatically upon executing a PM application, like the 16-bit
Windows-on-Windows (WOW), POSIX, or OS/2 subsystems. When executing a PM
application, the Win32 desktop is replaced by the PM desktop. When using
the Win32 desktop, PMSHELL will appear as a minimized icon on the Win32
desktop.
<P>
- Starting PM applications
<P>
Any PM application can be run from a Program Manager icon, File Manager, or
CMD command prompt. To start a PM application without switching to the PM
subsystem, you can create a Win32 Program Manager icon with the "Run
minimized" option enabled. The application will be active when you switch
to the PM subsystem.
<P>
- User interface with PM subsystem
<P>
The user has the ability to manipulate the windows under PMNT just as they
would under regular OS/2 PM. They can maximize, minimize, resize, and close
windows as normal. Cutting and pasting between PM applications happens as
normal, in all three formats: text, bitmap, and metafile; however, when
cutting and pasting between PM and Win32 applications only text and bitmap
formats are supported. The PM Task Manager is available as normal, with one
addition: a "Shutdown PM" button has been added below the "Switch to" and
"End Task" buttons.
<P>
- Switching from the PM to Win32 desktop
<P>
The user can switch from the PM desktop to the Win32 desktop in 3 ways:

<OL><P><LI>Using &lt;CTRL&gt;&lt;ESC&gt; switches to the Win32 desktop, and brings up the Win32
   Task Manager.  All active applications, including PM applications, are
   displayed in the list.

<P><LI>Using &lt;ALT&gt;&lt;ESC&gt; sets the focus to the next Win32 application, thereby
   switching to the Win32 desktop.

<P><LI>Using &lt;ALT&gt;&lt;TAB&gt; switches to the Win32 desktop then displays the
   switching title bar, allowing the user to choose the application to
   switch to.
<P>
</OL>- Switching from PM to Win32 desktop
<P>
All running PM applications show as minimized Win32 CMD icons, and also on
the Win32 Task List. Double-clicking a PM application icon or choosing a PM
application from the Task List switches the display to the PM desktop.
<P>
- Exiting a PM application
<P>
PM applications should be exited by the normal PM manner, by choosing the
Close option of the applications system menu or another Exit option
provided by the application.
<P>
If the user chooses to close the application by any other method, the PM
subsystem may require him to interact with the application, or may generate
a Win32 dialog with the "Wait," "End Task," and "Cancel" buttons. This
dialog should not be used to close the application, therefore the user
should always choose "Cancel" if confronted with this dialog in regards to
a PM application.
<P>
- Terminating the PM subsystem
<P>
The recommended way to shutdown the PM Desktop is to choose "Shutdown PM"
from the PM Task Manager, and the PM subsystem will generate a confirmation
dialog with the "Shutdown" and "Cancel" options. If the user chooses to
close the subsystem by selecting "End Task" from the Win32 Task Manager, a
Win32 dialog will be generated with the "Wait," "End Task," and "Cancel"
buttons. The user should NOT choose any of these options. The display
should automatically switch to the PM Desktop, where the "Shutdown" and
"Cancel" confirmation dialog should be presented. After "Shutdown" is
selected, the PM Desktop will close, and the Win32 Desktop will return.
However, the former dialog will still be present. The user should ALWAYS
choose "Cancel" from this dialog to ensure the PM subsystem will close
properly.
<P>
- Abnormal Termination
<P>
If the PM Desktop appears to be hung, or PM applications do not appear to
start, the PM subsystem may need to be terminated. First, determine if the
Win32 subsystem has been affected. To do this, press the NumLock key on the
keyboard. If the NumLock light still toggles on and off, the Win32 system
is still active, attempt to switch to the Win32 Desktop and allow 5 minutes
for the system to react. If the display does not switch after 5 minutes,
reboot the machine.
<P>
If the Win32 Desktop is still accessible, then terminate all OS/2 character-
mode applications and PM applications, using the Win32 Task Manager's "End
Task" option or by closing the Win32 windows that represent them. If a
Win32 dialog appears with the "Wait," "End Task" or "Cancel" appears, then
choose "End Task." NOTE: This is an exception to the previously stated
rule, that the "End Task" selection should never be chosen for a PM
application. After all OS/2 applications are closed, perform the same steps
on PMSHELL. Then, using the KILL.EXE utility from disk #1 of the PMNT
release disks, execute "KILL OS2SRV." This will terminate the OS/2
subsystem in NT. Upon executing any OS/2 application, command line or PM,
the OS/2 subsystem will restart. If the OS/2 subsystem will not terminate,
then a reboot of the system may be required.
<P>
<P><h3>Services offered by the PM Subsystem</h3>
 
<P>
Printing:
<P>
The PM subsystem supports printing on local or remote printers. The PM
subsystem only supports using PMPRINT, not the LMPRINT queue driver. Remote
printers have to be connected using the "net use" command from a Win32
window. Print notifications appear as a WinPopUp, so the display switches
to the Win32 Desktop. NOTE: Direct hardware access is not allowed, so some
printer drivers may not work properly.
<P>
The PM Subsystem supplies the following PM print drivers:
<P>
- Generic postscript Print Driver, which supports a variety of postscript
<PRE>  printers

</PRE></OL>- EPSON Print Driver, which supports several EPSON (and compatible)
<PRE>  printers

</PRE>- IBM 51523 Graphics Printer 2 (and compatible) Print Driver (please note
<PRE>  that this particular PM print driver makes extensive use of CLI/STI and
  thus runs significantly more slowly on the PM Subsystem than it would
  under OS/2 1.x).

</PRE>- HP LaserJet Print Driver
<P>
System Utilities:

<UL><LI>Desktop Manager. PMNT does not supply a Desktop Manager. The user is
   expected to execute his PM applications from icons and groups in the
   Win32 Program Manager. Applications which modify groups will modify the
   Win32 program groups.

<LI>Task Manager. Both the PM and Win32 Task Managers are available under
   the PM Subsystem, access is described above.

<LI>Control Panel. Time &amp; Date works on the system time. Changing the mouse
   to Left-hand in Win32 Control Panel affects PM applications as well.
   Cursor Blink, Double Click, Screen Colors, Border Width, Warning Beep,
   Mouse, Country, COM Port Configuration, Add/Delete Printer/Queue Driver
   and Add/Delete Font affect PM applications only.

<LI>Print Manager. The OS/2 Print Manager is supplied with virtually no
   changes.

<LI>File Manager. No File Manager is supplied with PMNT. The Win32 File
   Manager should be used for handling files.
