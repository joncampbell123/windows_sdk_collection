The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
When you specify a separator file during remote administration of a
Windows NT printer, if the Windows NT subdirectory name on the local
computer and the remote computer (to which the printer is attached) do
not match, you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Could not set printer: The specified separator file is invalid.

</PRE>When you specify the location of a separator file, you can either type
a filename directly, type a path and filename directly, or choose the
ellipses (...) and use the Select Separator Page dialog box.
<P>
If you include only a filename and that filename is located in the
search path of the computer to which the printer is attached, no error
message appears.
<P>
If you type a filename and path name (not using the Select Separator
Page dialog box) and include the location of the separator page on the
computer to which the printer is attached, no error message appears.
<P>
You use the Select Separator Page dialog box to locate the separator
file on your local computer. This will not pose a problem if the file
can be found in exactly the same path on the computer to which the
printer is attached, but if any part of the path and/or filename is
different, you will receive the error message when trying to close the
Printer Properties dialog box.
<P>
The computer to which the printer is attached stores the location of
the separator file in its registry, even during remote administration.
Because Windows NT stores the entire filename entered into the
Separator File text box, when specifying a file, you must refer to a
file that is located on that computer.
