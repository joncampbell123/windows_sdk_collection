The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how to install Windows 95 print drivers on a Windows
NT Server or Workstation 4.0 print server computer. This allows Windows 95
clients to connect to the print server and obtain the driver.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If the printer already exists on the Windows NT 4.0 server, use the
following steps to add a Windows 95 driver for use by Windows 95 clients:

<OL><P><LI>Log on to the computer running Windows NT 4.0 Server or Workstation
   using an account that has administrator privileges.

<P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Printers.

<P><LI>Select the printer for which you want to add a Windows 95
   driver.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Properties, then click the Sharing tab.

<P><LI>In the list of alternate drivers, select Windows 95, then click OK.

<P><LI>Point to a directory that contains the .inf file and the printer driver.
<P>
   To do this, you can do any one of the following:
<P>
   a. Point to a directory path for an existing Windows 95 computer where
<P><PRE>      the necessary printer driver is already installed.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      1) On the computer running Windows 95, share the Windows directory.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      2) On the computer running Windows NT 4.0, point to the Inf
<PRE></PRE>         subdirectory of the Windows directory you have just shared.

         For example, if the Windows directory was shared as "Windows" on a
         computer named \\Client1, type "\\Client1\Windows\Inf" (without
         the quotation marks), and then click OK.

      3) When prompted, point to the System subdirectory of the shared
         Windows directory.

         For example, if the Windows directory was shared as "Windows" on a
         computer named \\Client1, type "\\Client1\Windows\System" (without
         the quotation marks), and then click OK.

      -or-

   b. Point to a server where a shared Windows 95 installation resides.

      NOTE: This option may take some time.

      1) Point to the Inf subdirectory of your shared Windows installation.

         For example, if the shared Windows installation is located on
         \\Winserver\Sbs_share, type "\\Winserver\Sbs_share\Inf" (without
         the quotation marks), and then click OK.

      2) When prompted, point to the System subdirectory of your shared
         Windows installation.

         For example, if the shared Windows installation is located on
         \\Winserver\Sbs_share, type "\\Winserver\Sbs_share\System"
         (without the quotation marks), and then click OK.

      -or-

   c. Extract the files from the Windows 95 cabinet files. The cabinet
      files needed are Precopy2.cab, Win95_09.cab, Win95_10.cab, and
      Win95_11.cab.
      (NOTE: All the .drv files in OEMSR2 are now in win95_15.cab)

      1) If your Windows 95 compact disc is in drive D, and you are
         extracting the files into a directory called C:\W95print, the
         steps to do this would be:

         a) Create a directory named W95print.

         b) Open a command prompt and navigate to the W95print directory.

         c) With the Windows 95 compact disc inserted in the CD-ROM drive,
            type the following commands:

               d:\win95\extract.exe /e d:\win95\precopy2.cab *.*
               d:\win95\extract.exe /e d:\win95\win95_09.cab *.*
               d:\win95\extract.exe /e d:\win95\win95_10.cab *.*

            NOTE: The filenames of the cab files above may be different
            depending upon your installation media. Some Original
            Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) have changed the names of
            the installation files.

      2) When prompted, point to C:\W95print as the path to load the
         Windows 95 drivers. If you know the .Inf file you need, select
         it from this directory, otherwise select the Msprint.inf file
         and it will show a list of all the printer drivers that come
         with Windows 95.

         NOTE: You may be prompted to locate a fourth cabinet file,
         win95_11.cab, to complete the driver installation. If so, use
         the same extract command from step c above and extract all of the
         files from win95_11.cab file.

</PRE></OL>If you are creating a new printer on a computer running Windows NT 4.0
Server, use the following steps to install a Windows 95 driver on the
Windows NT Server or Workstation computer for use by Windows 95 clients:

<OL><P><LI>Log on to the computer running Windows NT 4.0 Workstation or Server
   using an account that has administrator privileges.

<P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Settings, and click Printers.

<P><LI>Double-click the Add Printer icon.

<P><LI>Click My Computer, then click Next.

<P><LI>Click to select the port the printer will use, then click Next.
<P>
   NOTE: If the port does not already exist on the computer the
   printer is connected to, you will need to create the port.

<P><LI>Click the printer make and model, then click Next.

<P><LI>Type a printer name, then click Next.

<P><LI>Click Shared, type a share name, then click to select Windows 95 in the
   list of operating systems.

<P><LI>Point to a directory that contains the .inf file and the printer driver.
   To do this, see step a, b, or c mentioned above.
<P>
</OL><h3>Third-Party Drivers</h3>
 
<P>
This article does not apply to third-party printer drivers that did not
ship on the Windows 95 CD. If you are installing a Windows 95 point and
print driver on Windows NT for Windows 95 clients and you receive an error
message, please notify the vendor. In order to load Windows 95 drivers on
Windows NT 4.x computers, the vendor must follow the specifications listed
in the Windows 95 Resource Kit, Appendix C and D. ISBN 1-55615-678-2.
Please contact your vendor for an updated Inf file.
<P>

print, please see the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article:
