<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Windows NT Server 3.51 starts a broadcast storm on the network with browser
frames after the Windows NT Server Service has reached the System Up Time
of 1193 hours, which means it has been running continuously for 1193 hours
or multiples thereof. These broadcast frames are sent out on all installed
protocols. The broadcast storm typically last less than 5 or 6 minutes and
then stops by itself. The broadcast browser frame types that appear are the
"Host Announcements" or the "Local Master Announcements" frames, which are
typically sent out every 12 minutes.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.5 and
3.51.
<P>
A supported fix is now available for Windows NT version 3.5, but has not
been fully regression-tested and should be applied only to systems
experiencing this specific problem. Unless you are severely impacted by
this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next
Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft Product Support
Services for more information.
<P>
This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows
NT version 3.51 and Windows NT 4.0.  For information on obtaining the
Service Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
