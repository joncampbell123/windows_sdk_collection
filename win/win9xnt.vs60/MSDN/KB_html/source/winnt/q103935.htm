The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
Windows NT supports the use of the QIC-40/QIC-80 tape backup drives.
However, the driver they use is named QIC-117.SYS; there are no files
named QIC-40.SYS or QIC-80.SYS.
<P>
According to the QIC documentation, QIC-40 and QIC-80 are two types of
"Flexible-Disk-Controller-Compatible Recording Format for Information
Interchange." The specifications are as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   20 tracks, 10,000 bpi, MFM Encoded (QIC-40)
   28 tracks, 14,700 bpi, MFM Encoded (QIC-80)

</PRE>QIC-117 is described as a "Common Command Set Interface Specification
for Flexible Disk Controller Based Minicartridge Tape Drives."
<P>
Therefore, QIC-40/80 is the name of a physical format standard and
QIC-117 is the name of the command set used on QIC-40/80 drives, which
is why the driver is named QIC-117.SYS in Windows NT. In other words,
QIC-117 is the interface used to communicate with the drive while
QIC-40/80 is the physical format used on the tape. Windows NT Backup
uses Microsoft Tape Format (MTF) as its native format. MTF is not read
or write compatible with QIC-40/80. Thus you cannot exchange tapes
between Windows NT Backup, which uses MTF, and Colorado Memory
Systems' Backup software, which uses QIC-40/80.
