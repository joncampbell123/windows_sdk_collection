<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article is intended to describe the procedures for setting up the
debugger on a Windows NT system using a Null modem cable attached to
another Windows NT system.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The process of setting up the debugger with a Null modem cable is broken
down into the following topics:

<UL><LI>What is the need for the kernel debugger?
<LI>What is the process of remote debugging?
<LI>Why use a Null modem cable?
<LI>Changing the attributes on the Boot.ini file
<LI>Debugger Options
<LI>Configuring the debugger for the system
<LI>Setting up the Null modem cable
<LI>Configuring the Host machine for a Remote.exe session
<P>
</UL><h3>What is the need for the kernel debugger?</h3>
 
<P>
The kernel debugger that comes with Microsoft Windows NT provides
information about the system that is normally not available without the aid
of the debugger. Windows NT has the ability to enable the kernel debugger
from the Windows NT start-up menu (Boot.ini). Enabling the kernel debugger
allows the Windows NT debugger to output debugging information to a remote
debugger for a remote user to analyze. This is normally done at the request
of a Microsoft Support Engineer for analyzing a fatal error in Windows NT
that cannot be diagnosed from the Memory.dmp file or when a Memory.dmp file
is not produced.
<P>
<P><h3>What is the process of remote debugging?</h3>
 
<P>
For our discussion the target machine will be the system that is being
debugged and the host machine will be the system doing the debugging. The
process of remote debugging happens when two computers are connected by the
serial communication ports. The target computer and the host computer are
running the Windows NT kernel debuggers, which communicate using a special
debug API and Protocol.
<P>
<P><h3>Why use a Null modem cable?</h3>
 
<P>
Connecting the Null modem cable to a serial port allows the debugger to run
at its current top speed of 19200, compared to the speed of 9600 over a
modem. It is generally considered more reliable than using a modem for the
following reasons: it does not involve configuring a modem, there is no
possibility of a modem or line failure, a system can be debugged locally,
and finally it provides faster debugging.
<P>
The most common method is to set up a target computer for debugging and the
host computer for doing the debugging using a Remote.exe session. This
configuration allows a technical support person to connect to the
Remote.exe session by means of a RAS connection and debug the target
computer without physically being present at the target computer.
<P>
<P><h3>Changing the attributes on the Boot.ini file</h3>
 
<P>
To set up the target computer, simply edit the Boot.ini file in the boot
partition and add the appropriate debugger options. The Boot.ini is edited
using a standard ASCII text editor. The Boot.ini is hidden in the boot
partition directory. The Boot.ini attributes are hidden, read-only and
system. These attributes must be changed to edit the Boot.ini file.
<P>
To change the attributes of the Boot.ini file:
<P>
At the command prompt, type attrib -h -r -s c:\boot.ini and press Enter,
and then edit the file. To restore the read-only, hidden, and system
attributes when you finish editing the file, type attrib +h +r +s
c:\boot.ini at the command prompt.
<P>
- Or -

<OL><P><LI>In File Manager, choose By File Type on the View menu. Select the Show
   Hidden/System Files box in the By File Type dialog box, and click OK.

<P><LI>In the File Manager window, select the Boot.ini file, and then choose
   Properties on the File menu.

<P><LI>In the Properties dialog box, clear the Read Only, Hidden, and System
   Attribute box and click OK.

<P><LI>Edit the Boot.ini using Notepad or another text editor.
<P>
</OL><h3>Debugger Options</h3>
 
<P>
Once the Boot.ini on the target computer is opened for editing, several
options can be added to the Boot.ini file to configure the debugger
environment on the target computer. The various options available are
listed and described below.
<P>
<PRE>/DEBUG      - This option is used to enable the kernel debugger

</PRE></OL>/DEBUGPORT  - Specifies the serial port to be used by the kernel
<PRE>              debugger. If no serial port is specified the debugger will
              default to COM2.

</PRE>/CRASHDEBUG - Instructs the system to create a Memory.dmp file when a
<PRE>              fatal error has occurred.

/BAUDRATE   - Sets the Baud rate that the kernel debugger will use. The
              default baud rate is 19200. A baud of 9600 is the normal
              rate for remote debugging over a modem.

</PRE><h3>Configuring the debugger for the system</h3>
 
<P>
There are several options available for configuring the debugger on the
target computer. To add any one of the previous options to the Boot.ini,
use the following example.
<P>
The following is a typical Boot.ini. Each entry in the [operating systems]
section should correspond to the options listed in the boot menu during a
normal system startup.
<P>
[boot loader]
timeout=30
default=multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\WINDOWS
[operating systems]
multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\WINDOWS="Windows NT" Version 3.5"
multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\WINDOWS="Windows NT" Version 3.5 [VGA
mode]" /BASEVIDEO
C:\="MS-DOS"
<P>
To enable the debugger, use COM1 to do the following.

<OL><P><LI>Select the startup option that you normally use and add either the
   /debug switch at the end of the line.

<P><LI>To specify the communications port, add the switch /debugport=com1
<P>
</OL>[boot loader]
timeout=30
default=multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\WINDOWS
[operating systems]
multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\WINDOWS="Windows NT" Version 3.5"
/debug /debugport=com1
multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\WINDOWS="Windows NT" Version 3.5 [VGA
mode]" /BASEVIDEO
C:\="MS-DOS"
<P>
<P><h3>Setting up the Null modem cable</h3>
 
<P>
A Null modem cable is a serial cable that has been configured to allow data
to be sent between two serial ports. Normally you connect a serial port to
a serial device. In this case we need to configure the target computer to
accept a serial-port-to-serial-port connection. It is important that a Null
modem cable be used because if a normal serial cable is used the target
system expects a serial device, not another serial port, and the system
cannot be debugged.
<P>
When you use a NULL modem to make a direct serial connection between two
computers, your cable must be wired as shown in the following tables.

<P>
<P><h3>Configuring the Host computer for a Remote.exe session</h3>
 
<P>
The concept here is that the host computer is being set up to do a debug
of the target computer as if there were a technical support person sitting
at the host computer. The Remote.exe will be run to allow this debug
session to be accessed remotely through a RAS connection.
<P>
The Remote.exe is a command line utility which allows you to run
command-line programs on remote computers. Remote.exe uses two parts,
the server component and the client component. To use Remote.exe, you must
first start the server end on the computer where you are debugging from.
This allows other users to connect to your debugging session using the
client portion of Remote. The Remote.exe comes with the Resource
Kit. For more details and the command syntax of this utility, refer to the
Resource Kit online help.
<P>
The Windows NT installation compact disc and the Windows NT Resource Kit
compact disc should be available to accomplish this setup.

<OL><P><LI>The first thing should be done is to set up a RAS account on the network
   for the technical support person. This information, including the name
   of the host system, should be documented and ready to give to the
   support person.

<P><LI>The host computer should be configured as described in the following
</OL>Microsoft Knowledge Base article <B><A href="../winnt/q148659.htm">Q148659</A></B>. This article describes in detail
how to set up the symbols on the host computer for debugging the target
computer.
<P>
<PRE>   Article-ID: <B><A href="../winnt/q148659.htm">Q148659</A></B>
   TITLE     : How to Set Up Windows NT Debug Symbols

</PRE><P><LI>The recommended way to run I386KD is to copy all of the files located
   in the \Support\Debug\I386\ directory (assuming that you are debugging
   an I386 computer) to a directory on the hard drive, and change to that
   directory.

<P><LI>Copy the Remote.exe from the Resource Kit to the same directory.

<P><LI>The I386KD relies on environment variables for information necessary
   to run successfully. I386KD uses many environment variables, the
   minimal needed in our case is the _NT_SYMBOL_PATH and the
   _NT_DEBUG_PORT variable. The set command is used to set the environment
   variables.  The _NT_SYMBOL_PATH variable points to the path of the
   symbols file that the debugger will use for the debug session. The
   _NT_DEBUG_PORT point to the active serial port being used on the host
   computer for debugging. If this is anything other than serial port 2
   then the _NT_DEBUG_PORT environment variable must be used.
<P>
   Example:
   The host computer Null modem cable will be connected to serial port 1
   and has copied the symbols to the c:\debug\symbols directory. At a
   command prompt type the following.
<P>
   SET _NT_DEBUG_PORT=COM1
   SET _NT_SYMBOL_PATH=C:\DEBUG\SYMBOLS

<P><LI>The only thing left to do at this point is to start the debug session
   and remote it out. At a command prompt type the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>       remote /s "i386kd -v" debug
