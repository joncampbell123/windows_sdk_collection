The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5 and 3.51
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5 and 3.51
</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article tells you how you can modify the properties of the User
Manager for Domains icon so that User Manager for Domains will select a
different domain user account database. Changing the icon's properties will
allow you to look at multiple user account databases without having
to wait for an account list from the default domain.
<P>
To do this, you will open User Manager for Domains on a Windows NT Server
that is acting in a member-server role, bypass the default domain account
list and bring up the user account list for the local computer account or
for other trusted domains.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Difference Between Member Server and Domain Controller:</h3>
 
<P>
A computer that is running Windows NT Server that is not installed as a
domain controller will act much like a NT Workstation and is usually
referred to as a member-server. It has much of the functionality of a
domain controller but it can never act as a domain controller it cannot
maintain a domain user account database. The member-server maintains a
local workgroup account database. It can function as a member of a
workgroup or as a member of a domain, just like Windows NT Workstation.
<P>
One of the differences between a member-server running Windows NT Server
(hereafter referred to as a Windows NT server) and a Windows NT Workstation
is that, by default, the Windows NT Server has an Administrative Tools
group that contains a set of applications identical to those that appear in
the Administrative Tools group on a Windows NT Server domain controller.
<P>
<P>
User Manager for Domains:
 
<P>
One of the tools in the Administrative group on an NT Server is User
Manager for Domains. By default, when you launch this application, User
Manager will open up either the local computer account database if Windows
NT is configured for a workgroup, or it will open up the domain account
database if Windows NT is configured to be part of a domain.
<P>
In a domain configuration, User Manager will open up the domain database
that it is part of. After the application is running, you can view another
domain account database by choosing User&gt;Select Domain on the menu.
<P>
If the default domain account database is large, you will have to wait
until the full list is received before you can switch to another account
database.
<P>
<P><h3>Changing The Icon Properties:</h3>
 
<P>
You can set up an icon or icons with properties that allow you to look at
multiple user account databases without having to wait for an account list
from the default domain. To do this, perform the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>In Administrative Tools, click the User Manager for  Domains icon.

<P><LI>Type ALT-Enter to bring up the icon's Properties page.

<P><LI>On the command line after USRMGR.EXE type a space, then type the
   name of the domain (or the local computer name).
<P>
</OL>NOTE: To bring up the user account database for another domain, there
must be a trust relationship between the user's domain and the domain the
user wants to view.
<P>
NOTE: Setting the icon properties to view another member-server's or
Windows NT Workstation's local account database will cause Windows NT to
respond with "Could not find domain controller for this domain. Do you want
to select another domain to administer?" Selecting "NO" closes User
Manager; selecting "YES" brings up the "Select Domain" dialog box.

<OL><P><LI>Optional: These icons can be copied by holding down CTRL and dragging
</OL>and dropping the icons to a new location in Administrative Tools (or any
other group).The icons can then be modified with properties that open the
local  account database, the default domain database, and a trusted
domain's database.
