The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
As your computer is being attacked there may be a jump in bandwidth
utilization on a subnet containing Windows NT computers and performance may
suffer. A network analyzer shows a large amount of UDP traffic, typically
from port 19 (chargen).
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
A malicious attack may be mounted against Windows NT computers with the
Simple TCP/IP Services installed. The attack consists of a flood of UDP
datagrams sent to the subnet broadcast address with the destination port
set to 19 and a spoofed source IP address. The Windows NT computers running
Simple TCP/IP services respond to each broadcast, creating a flood of UDP
datagrams.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Windows NT TCP/IP, Windows Sockets, and Simple TCP/IP services have been
modified to be more attack resistant. Windows Sockets now supports a new
socket option, SO_BROADCAST, that can be set to allow the recvfrom() call
to pass broadcast datagrams to the application. The default for this option
is OFF. Previous implementations passed broadcasts datagrams to any Windows
Sockets application that issued a recvfrom() call. Additionally, the
chargen service and other Simple TCP/IP services have been modified to drop
any datagrams that have the source port equal to the destination port to
prevent "looping" attacks.
<P>
