The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
On your system partition, you have a folder named Program in the root
directory (such as C:\Program).
<P>
When you attempt to start an application from the desktop, the Start menu,
or possibly from a file association, the following error message is
displayed:
<P>
<PRE>   Access to the specified device, path or file is denied

</PRE>This problem only affects applications whose executable files reside in
subdirectories of the Program Files directory.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This error is caused by applications that do not write quoted path strings
containing long file names into the registry. The execution of a process is
handled by the Win32 CreateProcess() API. CreateProcess() is unable to
distinguish between spaces in long file names, and spaces delimiting
arguments to the function. If a quoted string is passed to the API,
CreateProcess() is able to make this distinction and launches the
application as expected.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this problem, obtain the following fix or wait for the next
Windows NT service pack.
<P>
This fix should have the following time stamp:
<P>
<PRE>   09/15/97  21:39               372,496 Kernel32.dll (Intel)
   09/15/97  21:38               589,584 Kernel32.dll (Alpha)

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0.
A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested
and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem.
Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix.
Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
