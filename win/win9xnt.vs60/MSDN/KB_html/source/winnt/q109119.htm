<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1

<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you transfer files 20 megabytes (MB) or larger through File Manager,
the transfer takes a long time, and in some cases the transfer fails.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 
<P>
Use stripe sets across multiple physical drivers, with NTFS on all drives,
to the following:

<OL><P><LI>Create a share on the first stripe set (drive E) and name it TEST.
   Include a 28  MB text file called TEST.TXT.

<P><LI>On the second drive (drive F), create a share called PUBLIC.

<P><LI>Use the NET USE command to connect to both shares.

<P><LI>From File Manager, select drive E, and then select the TEST.TXT file.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Copy.

<P><LI>In the Copy dialog box, enter "F:\" (without the quotation marks) in the
   To field.

<P><LI>From the server, open a command prompt and do a Dir on drive F. The
   TEST.TXT file is in this directory with a size of 0 bytes.

<P><LI>Open a second window on Server Manager. From the Properties menu, choose
   Server, and then select In Use. The following four sessions are open
   between the workstation and the server:
<P>
<P><PRE>       - A read from drive E
       - A read from drive F
       - A read from drive E
       - A write to drive F
</PRE><P>
</OL>It appears the Copy command is being carried out at this time. Disk
activity stops on the server after approximately four minutes. The sessions
are closed, if you quickly do a Dir from the command prompt, the file
appears in the drive F directory, and the size is correct. Do a Dir again
and the file is gone. On the workstation, from File Manager, a STOP sign
appears, with the message saying the session was closed, and the copy
command could not be carried out. If the same command is done from the
command line, it is carried out fine:
<P>
<PRE>   C:\copy e:\test.txt f:\
