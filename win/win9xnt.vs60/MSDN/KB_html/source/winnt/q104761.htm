<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article contains information and issues associated with using the
Colorado Jumbo 250 Tape Backup System with Windows NT and the Windows
NT Backup program.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following are known issues using the Colorado Jumbo 250 Tape
Backup System with Windows NT:
<P>
<P><h3>No Tape Exchange Between Windows NT Backup and Colorado's Backup</h3>
 
<P>
Colorado's Backup software format is not compatible with Windows NT
Backup's tape format. You will not be able to restore a tape using
Windows NT Backup's Restore function that was originally backed up
using Colorado's Backup software. You must reformat your tapes with
Windows NT Backup for use with Windows NT. Also, you will not be able
to restore a tape using Colorado's Restore function that was
originally backed up using Windows NT Backup.
<P>
Windows NT Backup utilizes Microsoft Tape Format (MTF) as its native
format. MTF has several advantages over the QIC-40 and QIC-80 system,
such as built-in security which will not allow unauthorized access or
unauthorized restoration of data to other computers, without having
the correct password and permissions. MTF also provides the ability to
catalog backed-up data to quickly restore data based on special
criteria, such as time, date, file size, and set.
<P>
For more information on MTF, query on the following words in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

<PRE>   mtf and tape and format

</PRE><h3>Hardware and Software Data Compression is Not Supported</h3>
 
<P>
Windows NT Backup supports only the native capacity of the tape. Thus,
a Jumbo 250 tape has a maximum capacity of 125 megabytes (MB) when
used with Windows NT Backup.
<P>
NOTE: Data compression can be supported by either software (Colorado's
Backup software) or hardware (Colorado's TC-15 and TC-15M controllers
- see the following).
<P>
<P><h3>Windows NT Does Not Support the FC-10 or TC-15/TC-15M Controllers</h3>
 
<P>
Technical Note 36 (page 35) in the Windows NT Hardware Compatibility
List states that all QIC-40/QIC-80 Floppy Tape Drives are supported
using the floppy controller. Separate interface controllers for these
types of drives are not supported by Windows NT.
<P>
The Jumbo 250 is a QIC-80 (or Ximat) tape drive that connects to the
floppy controller in a standard configuration. This configuration
makes the drive's data transfer rate directly dependent on the speed
of the computer's floppy controller. Most floppy controllers operate
at a rate of 2 MB to 5 MB a minute.
<P>
NOTE: The Colorado Memory Systems tape controllers have a transfer
rate ranging from 1 megabit (Mb) per second to 500 kilobits (Kb) per
second, which is twice the speed of an AT floppy controller. The TC-15
and TC-15M controllers also have a hardware data compression feature.
<P>
The products included here are manufactured by Colorado Memory
Systems, Inc.; a vendor independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty,
implied or otherwise, regarding these products' performance or
reliability.
