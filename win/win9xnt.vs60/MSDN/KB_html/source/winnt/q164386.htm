<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
To assist in recovering lost volume sets, extended volume sets, stripe
sets, or fault tolerance sets, customers will call and request advice from
engineers on how to rebuild their hard drive information. Although
Microsoft has tools available that can often aid in rebuilding this
information, it is necessary to obtain vital information about the
computer, such as the following examples:

<UL><LI>In what order were partitions added to the stripe set?
<LI>What drives are part of the extended volume set?
<LI>What partitions are actually mirrored?
<P>
</UL>This article describes procedures to create a printout of the Disk
Administrators Screen so valuable hard drive configuration information
is preserved.
<P>
NOTE: It is always preferable to save the disk information to a floppy disk
by pointing to configuration and clicking save from the partition menu in
Disk Administrator. The procedures in this article are intended to
supplement this process and not replace it.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To create a print out of the disk administrator screen:

<OL><P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Programs, point to Administrative
   Tools, and click Disk Administrator.

<P><LI>Adjust the screen size so as much disk data is as visible as possible.

<P><LI>Press and hold down the Ctrl key and then press the Print Scrn key, this
   will place the data on your clipboard.

<P><LI>Open Paintbrush (in Windows NT 3.5 and 3.51) or Paint (Windows NT 4.0).

<P><LI>From the Edit menu, select Paste.

<P><LI>As desired, crop the image.

<P><LI>Print the image to a printer, preferably a color printer, or save the
   image file to a floppy disk for future reference.

<P><LI>If additional drive data is in disk administrator, scroll the screen and
   then repeat the procedure to save it.
<P></OL>
