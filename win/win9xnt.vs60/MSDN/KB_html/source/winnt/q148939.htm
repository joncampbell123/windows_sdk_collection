<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server makes an address
offer to a client and the client chooses an address from a different DHCP
server, the server that was not chosen keeps a DHCP lease  for the offered
address for 15 minutes.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When multiple DHCP servers put out address offers to a client, the server
whose offer is not accepted goes through a cleanup procedure. This
procedure should remove the address which was temporarily set aside from
the previous offer. However, this is not the case. The cleanup procedure is
not clearing the temporarily assigned lease out of the database.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this problem, install the fix mentioned below.
<P>
The temporary lease will last for 15 minutes. If you have extra leases
you can just let the lease expire. Some companies are very short on
available leases and cannot afford this, so a correction to DHCP has been
created.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51.
This problem was corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT
Workstation or Server version 3.51. For information on obtaining this
update, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
