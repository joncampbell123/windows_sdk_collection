<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Windows NT Print Manager does not allow you to choose a custom form, even
though the form's physical dimensions are less than or equal to the
dimensions of the largest predefined form that the device can use.
For example, a print device may support predefined letter-sized
forms (8.5" by 11") but will not accept a smaller custom form (such as
8.5" by 7"). This problem usually occurs when a printer driver that defines
the maximum custom page width or length at a value smaller than the
length or width of the largest predefined page size.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Background</h3>
 
<P>
There are three components to each printer driver: the base driver, the
user interface (UI) driver, and the characterization data file. The
characterization data file is a PPD file for PostScript devices, a PCD file
for plotting devices, or a minidriver for raster devices. It describes the
physical characteristics of one or more print devices (including the name,
dimensions, and margins of each predefined form that the print device
supports), and the maximum and minimum length and width of custom-defined
forms. The forms database on a Windows NT computer initially contains a
wide variety of forms. When you install printer drivers, the spooler checks
the characterization data file and adds the driver's forms to the Windows
NT forms database.
<P>
In Windows NT, each form associates a name with a set of length and width
measurements, and margin measurements. For example, the Letter default form
is 8.5" wide by 11" long, and has 0" margins. Only the form name must be
unique. Different print devices often recognize different names for the
same physical form dimensions, so the forms database often has several
forms that have the same dimensions, the same margins, or both.
<P>
When you run Print Manager and define a printer's form-to-tray mapping, or
its default form, Print Manager queries the driver for the physical sizes
of the forms the print device supports. Print Manager then displays a list
including every form in its database that has the same physical size as any
of the forms predefined in the driver. Consequently, these lists often show
multiple forms with identical sizes, such as Letter and Letter Small.
Additionally, you can't choose large page sizes such as Tabloid (11" by
17") on print devices that cannot support such sizes.
<P>
<P><h3>Problem</h3>
 
<P>
In some cases, the maximum length or width of a custom form is smaller than
the length or width of the print device's largest predefined form. For
example, the published specifications for the Epson LQ-870 ESC/P2 print
device state that the maximum physical page width is 10.1", and that the
imagable width is only 8.0". When using the Letter form, this print device
enforces .5" of combined left and right margins, so that applications
will not attempt to print on more than 8.0" of the page.
<P>
The Windows NT printer drivers for such print devices reflect these
specifications. For example, you could define a custom form 8.5" wide and
7.0" tall with 0" combined right and left margins, but this would have an
imagable width of 8.5". Because this would conflict with the device's
specification, Print Manager will not let you use this form on this device.
As a result, all custom-sized forms that you want to use with this device
under Windows NT must have a physical width less than or equal to 8.0" even
though the device supports physical pages up to 10.1" wide.
<P>
NOTE: The Epson LQ-870 ESC/P2 described in this example is not necessarily
the only print device with which you can encounter this problem.
<P>
To identify these restrictions:

<OL><P><LI>Run Windows NT Write.

<P><LI>Select a printer.

<P><LI>Select a predefined page size (such as Letter).

<P><LI>Select the Page Layout option from the Document menu, and enter 0" for
   all margins.

<P><LI>Select OK.
<P>
</OL>If the print device does not allow 0" margins, Write returns an
error message showing the minimum required margins for this form and
print device. For example, if you select an Epson LQ-870 ESC/P2
printer, choose the Letter form, and request 0" left and right margins,
the error message reports that the minimum left and right margins are
each .25".
<P>
The maximum printable width is:
<P>
<PRE>   (physical width of Letter form) - (minimum left margin) - (minimum
   right margin)

</PRE></OL>Using the Epson LQ-870 ESC/P2 as an example, the formula is
8.5 - .25 - .25, which equals 8.0.
