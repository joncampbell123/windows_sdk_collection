The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When an installation of a backup domain controller (BDC) is performed, the
primary domain controller (PDC) must be available to establish the computer
account and the Security Identifier (SID) for the new BDC. If the protocol
being used is TCP/IP and, in order to form a connection to the PDC, TCP/IP
must be routed, name resolution for the domain name and the computer name
must be established during the Network setup.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Name resolution for connectivity to the primary domain controller can be
established by using one of the following methods:

<UL><LI>Enter a primary and, optionally, a secondary WINS server where the PDC
   has registered the domain&lt;1Bh&gt; entry.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Use an LMHOSTS file that has at least an entry for the PDC as follows:
<P>
<P><PRE>      &lt;IP address&gt;  &lt;pdcname&gt;  #PRE  #DOM:&lt;domain&gt;
</PRE><P>
   For more information, see the following articles in the Microsoft
   Knowledge base:

<PRE></PRE>      TITLE     : How to Write an LMHOSTS File for Domain Validation

      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../crossnet/q180099.htm">Q180099</A></B>
      TITLE     : Troubleshooting LMHOSTS Name Resolution Issues

</PRE></UL>During installation, if WINS servers are not available, the LMHOSTS file
can be used by importing it from a floppy disk or from an existing physical
drive on the computer being installed. The location for importing the
LMHOSTS file is in the Advanced options in the TCP/IP configuration dialog
during Network setup. This must be completed during the portion of Setup
where you configure the properties of the TCP/IP protocol.
<P>
If the PDC cannot be located during setup, you will get the following error
message:
<P>
<PRE>   The domain controller for this domain cannot be located.

</PRE>If you get this message, check the following:

<UL><LI>Adapter configuration settings.

<LI>Default gateway configuration on the adapter.

<LI>If using WINS to locate the PDC, make sure the WINS server you are
   pointing to contains the 1Bh registration for the domain name.

<LI>Check the syntax of the LMHOSTS file.
<P>
</UL>At this point, installation must be restarted. Going back to the network
configuration by selecting the previous screen boxes will not reinitialize
your TCP/IP configuration settings.
<P>
NOTE: If you are installing a Windows NT 4.0 domain controller, restarting
the server will restart the installation at the GUI portion of setup.
Previous versions of Windows NT require setup to be restarted from the
beginning.
<P>
This scenario is not an issue for a server non-domain controller, as that
type of installation is capable of becoming part of a workgroup where
membership in the domain is not mandatory during setup.
