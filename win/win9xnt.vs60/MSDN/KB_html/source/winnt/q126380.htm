<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how to troubleshoot problems with your CD-ROM drive
in Windows NT.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If you are experiencing problems with your CD-ROM drive in Windows NT,
follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Make sure the CD-ROM drive is listed on the Windows NT hardware
    compatibility list (HCL).

<P><LI>If you use a SCSI CD-ROM drive, make sure the SCSI controller is
    listed on the Windows NT HCL.

<P><LI>If you use a CD-ROM drive or SCSI controller that is not listed on
    the Windows NT HCL, contact the device manufacturer for a Windows
    NT device driver or compatibility information.

<P><LI>Verify that the CD-ROM drive is installed using the manufacturer's
    specifications.

<P><LI>If you try to install a SCSI CD-ROM drive:
<P>
     - Verify that the SCSI bus is terminated correctly. On a SCSI bus,
       the last SCSI device should be terminated with a terminator
       provided by the manufacturer (refer to the SCSI adapter's
       documentation for more information about termination).
<P>
     - Verify the CD-ROM SCSI ID. The SCSI ID of the CD-ROM drive should
       normally be set to SCSI ID 2 or above. Make sure the CD-ROM drive
       is not configured to use the same SCSI ID another device is using.
       Refer to your CD-ROM drive documentation for information on how to
       set or change the SCSI ID of your CD-ROM drive.
<P>
     - Verify that the SCSI ID of the SCSI controller is set to SCSI ID 7.
<P>
     - Verify that no other adapters are configured with settings that
       conflict with the SCSI controller settings.
<P>
     - Check the Windows NT Event Viewer for error messages regarding the
       CD-ROM drive or SCSI controller.
<P>
     - In Control Panel, double-click the Devices icon, and make sure that
       the SCSICDRM device has a Startup value of System.

<P><LI>If you try to install an IDE CD-ROM drive:
<P>
     - Use a device driver designed for the CD-ROM drive that you have
       installed.
<P>
     - If a specific driver for your IDE CD-ROM drive is not provided by
       the manufacturer of the drive, install the IDE CD-ROM driver
       supplied in Windows NT. This driver is compatible only with IDE CD-
       ROM drives that are ATAPI 1.2 compliant. To verify the ATAPI
       compliance level of your CD-ROM drive, contact the drive
       manufacturer.
<P>
     - If you have three or more IDE devices on your system, including the
       CD-ROM drive, you may need to modify the Windows NT Registry to add
       support for more than two IDE devices. For more information, please
       see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

          TITLE     : Adding More Than Two IDE or ESDI Drives in Windows
                      NT

</PRE><P><LI>If you try to install a CD-ROM drive that uses a proprietary, non-SCSI
    interface:
<P>
     - Verify that the proper device driver is installed by running
       Windows NT Setup and selecting Add/Remove SCSI Adapters from the
       Options menu.
<P>
     - Check the Windows NT Read Me (Readme.wri) file and the Windows NT
       HCL for notes concerning your proprietary interface CD-ROM drive.

<P><LI>Determine if the CD-ROM drive is recognized by Windows NT. Run Windows
    NT File Manager or Windows NT Explorer to see if a drive letter is
    assigned to the CD-ROM drive.

<P><LI>If the CD-ROM drive is assigned a drive letter, try to view a
    directory of the CD-ROM drive. Make sure a data compact disc is
    inserted into the CD-ROM drive.

<P><LI>If you can read a data compact disc, but cannot play a music compact
    disc, double-click Devices in Control Panel, and then set the Cdaudio
    device startup to System. Some SCSI-1 CD-ROM drives require the
    Cdaudio service, as do SCSI-2 drives that do not support SCSI-2
    Cdaudio.
<P>
    If your speakers are plugged into a sound card, plug them directly
    into the headphone jack on your CD-ROM drive to test whether the audio
    CD is playing.

<P><LI>If the system is configured to dual-boot to another operating system,
    confirm that the CD-ROM drive functions in the other operating system.
    If the CD-ROM drive does not function properly in MS-DOS or another
    operating system, contact the manufacturer of the drive for
    assistance.
