   Server version 3.1
</UL>

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The Windows NT Resource Guide, Volume 1 of the Windows NT Resource Kit,
incorrectly defines the functionality of a Server Message Block (SMB) as it
pertains to networking architecture. On page 583, it states:
<P>
<PRE>   The redirector packages SMB requests meant for remote computers in a
   structure known as a Network Control Block (NCB). NCBs can be sent over
   the network to a remote device.

</PRE>In actuality, NCBs are never sent over the wire. Rather, SMBs are
transmitted over the physical media instead.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
The NCB functions as an intermediary between the redirector and the
protocol driver in Microsoft network architecture. Requests from the
redirector sent down the network stack to the protocol driver must first be
registered as NCB commands. Examples of NCB commands are ADD.NAME, CALL,
RECEIVE, and SEND. Once the commands are registered in the NCB, the
redirector calls the protocol driver and passes a pointer to the memory
location of the NCB. The protocol driver can then act on the data contained
in the SMBs according to the instructions contained in the NCB. The
protocol driver then registers the results of the completed redirector
requests in the appropriate NCB field and returns program control to the
redirector.
<P>
The technical classification for an NCB is Interface Control Information,
or ICI. Interface Control Information functions completely within the
layered architecture of an individual protocol stack, and therefore this
control information itself never passes across the physical media of the
network. The SMB may be classified as a Protocol Data Unit (PDU) which
ultimately is transmitted across the physical network connection from one
station to another.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Windows NT Resource
Kit. We are researching this problem and will post new information here as
it becomes available.
