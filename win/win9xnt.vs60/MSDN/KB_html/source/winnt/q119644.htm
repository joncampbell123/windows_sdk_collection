<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you connect to a Windows NT computer from a computer with a very slow
network card (for example, the 3Com 3c501 EtherLink card) installed,
copying files to the workstation from the server can be extremely slow when
using NetBEUI as the protocol.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The 3Com 3c501 card can only cope with a send window size of one. Windows
NT dynamically adapts the send window size for a session to cope with the
performance of different network cards and differing network conditions,
however it does not set it to a value less than two. This means that the
server always sends at least two data packets before expecting an
acknowledgment from the workstation. Because the network card in the
workstation can only cope with one packet at a time, the second packet is
lost and the workstation only acknowledges receipt of the first packet. The
server then has to resend the second packet.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
A new Registry parameter called MinimumSendWindowLimit has been added for
the Windows NT NBF (NetBEUI) protocol to allow the configuration of the
minimum send window size that NBF will use. The default value is 2. To fix
the above problem, this parameter needs to be changed to 1.
<P>
Use the Registration Information Editor (REGEDT32.EXE) to add this entry,
as follows:
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
<PRE>   problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them.
   Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of
   Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

</PRE><P><LI>Start REGEDT32.EXE and locate the following Registry subkey:
<P>
<P><PRE>      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\CurrentControlSet\Services\NBF\Parameters
</PRE>
<P><LI>From the Edit menu, choose Add Value. Enter MinimumSendWindowLimit in
   the Value Name field. Select REG_DWORD for the Data Type. Enter 1 in the
   data field. Save your changes.

<P><LI>Quit REGEDT32.

<P><LI>Quit Windows NT and restart your computer.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT and Windows NT
Advanced Server version 3.1. This problem has been corrected in the latest
U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT and Windows NT Advanced Server version
3.1. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following
word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):
