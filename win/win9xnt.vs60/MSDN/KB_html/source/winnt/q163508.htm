The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
You receive a STOP 0x0000000A in Ntfs.sys during a reboot after disk
corruption or after the system has been shut down in a "dirty" state.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The STOP occurs while NTFS is attempting to mount a partition whose boot
sector or MFT has become corrupted. One possible cause of corruption that
can bring on this problem is a "dirty" shutdown, which is when the computer
is turned off or reset without the system's being shut down first. However,
other types of corruption can cause this problem. Not all drive corruption
will cause this problem. In many cases the corruption will simply prevent
the drive from being mounted, without causing a STOP during boot.
<P>
There is no easy way, short of a live debug of the crashed server, to
determine conclusively if you have encountered this problem. However, one
simple test is to do a parallel install of Windows NT on the system. If you
have encountered this problem, the parallel install should show the same
stop 0xA in Ntfs.sys.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this problem, perform the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Identify the partition that is corrupted.
</OL>2. Prevent the partition from being mounted and boot Windows NT.
3. Apply the fix described below, reboot Windows NT, and/or re-enable the
<PRE>   partition.

</PRE></OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If the corrupted partition is your system or boot partition, you will most
likely need to reformat the partition, reinstall Windows NT, and restore
the partition information from a backup, as there will be no way to boot
after disabling the partition.
<P>
There are two methods you can use to identify the corrupted partition and
prevent it from being mounted (as required by steps 1 and 2 above). Which
method you use depends upon whether or not the partition is on the same
drive as your system/boot partition. The two methods are:

<OL><P><LI>Remove or disable drives one at a time until the system boots. This
   method will not work for the drive containing your system or boot
   partition, but if the corrupted partition is on another drive in the
   system, removing them one at a time and attempting to boot the system
   will identify which drive the partition is on, as once it is removed,
   Windows NT should boot successfully. Once you have successfully booted
   Windows NT you can apply the fix, shut down the system, re-install or
   re-enable the drive, and reboot.

<P><LI>Use a disk editor to disable the partitions one at a time. If the
   corrupted partition is on the same drive as your system or boot
   partition, you will need to boot to an alternative operating system
   (either MS-DOS or Windows 95 will work) and use a disk editor such as
   Norton Disk Edit to disable the partition. Once the partition is
   disabled, Windows NT should boot successfully. Then you can apply the
   fix, reboot and use a partition editor to re-enable the partition, and
   then restart Windows NT. Disabling the partition is accomplished by
   changing the system indicator byte to an unsupported file system type
   not recognized by Windows NT.
<P>
</OL>After you have disabled the partition and rebooted Windows NT, you can
apply the fix. The fix corrects an error in NTFS which caused the STOP 0xA
to occur when the volume was mounted during the boot sequence; however, the
corruption that caused the error condition to occur will still be there.
After the fix has been applied you can add back in the drive you removed or
use a disk editor to re-enable the partition (depending on which of the
above options you chose). You should then be able to boot into Windows NT
and attempt to recover the partition. Depending on the extent of the
corruption, recovering the partition may be as simple as running chkdsk
against it or may require you to reformat the partition and restore the
data from a backup copy.

To replace the Ntfs.sys file using the repair process, follow the
instructions in the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
