SUMMARY
 
<P>
The following article discusses the licensing considerations when you
deploy Microsoft Cluster Server (MSCS).
<P>
MORE INFORMATION
 
<P>
Each application vendor must determine its own licensing policies for
applications running on Microsoft Cluster Server clusters.
<P>
The current policy for server application licensing provided by Microsoft
applies to MSCS clusters: an application must be separately licensed for
each server on which it is installed.
<P>
<P><h3>Per-Seat Licensing</h3>
 
<P>
If the customer is using per-seat Client Access Licenses (CALs) for the
application, those licenses apply when a client is accessing the
application on either server in the cluster.
<P>
<P><h3>Per-Server Licensing</h3>
 
<P>
If the customer is using per-server (or concurrent use) Client Access
Licenses for the application, each computer in the cluster should have a
sufficient number of per-server Client Access Licenses for the expected
peak load of the application on that computer
<P>
For example, if both nodes of a cluster were running Microsoft SQL Server
Enterprise Edition, with 100 Clients Access Licenses per node, as the
typical number of connections, the nodes should both be set for 200 CALs to
service the connections after failover.
<P>
NOTE: Per-server Client Access Licenses do not failover from one computer
in the cluster to the other.
<P>
<P><h3>Cluster Server Licensing</h3>
 
<P>
In a Cluster Server cluster, if an application runs on both servers, or
even if it only runs on one server at a time but must be installed on both
servers to permit failover, the application must be licensed for both
servers. Thus, MSCS is licensed per server.
<P>
Client licensing is covered under the Microsoft Windows NT Server licensing
agreement.
