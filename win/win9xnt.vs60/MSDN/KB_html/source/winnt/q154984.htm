The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Your Domain Name System (DNS) server does not recursively resolve names
which contain a large number of IP addresses. However, the DNS server does
resolve names which contain one or a small number of IP addresses.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When a DNS response contains more data than can fit in a UPD packet (more
than 512 bytes,) it sends as much data that can fit into the UDP packet
and sets the truncation bit, indicating that there is more data available.
<P>
The Microsoft DNS server discards packets with the truncation bit set and
tries another authoritative server. The DNS server always receives the
same response with the truncation bit set, so it eventually stops and
returns SERVFAIL to the client.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft DNS Server has been modified to accept truncated responses
and return that response to the client.
<P>
Obtain the following fix, or wait for the next Windows NT service pack.
