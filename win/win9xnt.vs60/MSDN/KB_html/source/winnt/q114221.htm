<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
A session between a Windows for Workgroups 3.11 client and a Windows NT
Advanced Server over IPX with NetBIOS protocol may be dropped. Several
problems may occur with Windows for Workgroups clients when this happens,
including experiencing a general protection (GP) fault, or receiving an
Server Message Block (SMB) error 1,6 indicating an Invalid File Handle
during file I/O after the session has been idle for three or four minutes.
<P>
This problem usually occurs when Windows for Workgroups clients are
running applications of the Windows NT Advanced Server and have several
files open on the server. Net Sessions on the Windows NT Advanced Server
displays the active sessions on the server; if the session remains idle
for a few minutes, the session is dropped and when you attempt any
operation related to the open files, you may experience a GP fault.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The network sessions get dropped because the Windows for Workgroups client
does not respond to the keep-alive packets from the server if they are
sent at 30-second intervals, which is the default of NWNBLINK.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, change the KeepAliveTimeout value in the
Windows NT Advanced Server Registry from 60 (this value represents half-
seconds) to 30. The Registry entry for KeepAliveTimeout is in the
following location:
<P>
<PRE>   LocalMachine\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\NWNBLINK\Parameters

</PRE>When you change the KeepAliveTimeout value to 30, the keep-alive packets
are sent every 15 seconds. This helps maintain the session and eliminates
GP faults.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem. We are researching this
problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
as it becomes available.
