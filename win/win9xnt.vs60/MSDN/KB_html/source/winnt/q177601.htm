</UL> 
<P>
The following is the text of the Microsoft File and Print Services for
NetWare (FPNW) version 4.0 Readme.txt file.
<P>
Microsoft File and Print Services for NetWare® for Microsoft Windows NT
Server Version 4.0
<P>
RELEASE NOTE:
<P>
Welcome to File and Print Services for NetWare (FPNW) for Microsoft Windows
NT Server version 4.0. This compact disc contains both File and Print
Services for NetWare and Directory Service Manager for NetWare.
<P>
INSTALLING FPNW VERSION 4.0:
<P>
File and Print Services for NetWare version 4.0 can be installed only on
computers running Windows NT Server version 4.0. You must be logged on as a
member of the Administrators group to install FPNW.
<P>
Follow this procedure only to install FPNW version 4.0 on a computer that
does not already have FPNW. To upgrade from a previous version of FPNW ,
see "Upgrading From Previous Version of FPNW."
<P>
TO INSTALL FPNW:

<OL><P><LI>Insert the Services for NetWare compact disc in the computer's CD-ROM
   drive.

<P><LI>Double-click My Computer, and then double-click Control Panel.

<P><LI>Double-click Network.

<P><LI>Click the Services tab, then click Add.

<P><LI>Click Have Disk. IMPORTANT -- If File and Print Services for NetWare
   appears in the Network Service list, do not select it; instead, click
   "Have Disk".

<P><LI>Type the appropriate path, and click OK.
<P>
   The path is drive:\FPNW\NT40\processor, where drive is the drive letter
   of the CD-ROM drive and processor is the server's processor type. For
   example, type d:\fpnw\nt40\i386 to install on an x86-based computer with
   a CD-ROM drive at drive D. The possible values for processor are i386,
   MIPS, ALPHA, and PPC.

<P><LI>Select File and Print Services for NetWare, and click OK. The Setup
   program copies files.

<P><LI>In the Directory For SYS Volume box, type the location for the SYSVOL
   directory that will be the NetWare SYS: volume. It is recommended that
   you specify a directory on an NTFS partition; if you specify a directory
   on a non-NTFS partition, you lose the security features that NTFS
   provides and will not be able to set or enforce file or directory
   security settings.

<P><LI>In the Server Name box, type the computer name that NetWare client
   computers will use to access the server. The default is the server's
   computer name with _FPNW (underscore FPNW) appended.

   and must be unique.

<P><LI>Type a password for the Supervisor's account in the Supervisor Account
   group box.
<P>
   You must type the same password in the Password and Confirm Password
   boxes. The password can be as many as 14 characters, and is case-
   sensitive.

<P><LI>In the Advanced Tuning group box, select one of the options to tune the
   server's performance.
<P>
   You can change these options later using the Network application in the
   Control Panel. Click the Services tab, click "File and Print Services
   for NetWare," and then click Properties.

   controllers in a domain, you must specify the same password for this
   account on each domain controller on which you install the utility.

<P><LI>Click Close, and then restart the computer to complete the
   installation.
<P>

</OL>INSTALLING NOTE:
<P>
Installation Problem With Alpha Processors
<P>
If you install on a computer with an Alpha processor, using the computer's
own CD-ROM drive, you may receive the following error message during file
copying:
<P>
<PRE>   An error occurred while Windows was working with the Control Panel file
   %systemroot%\system32\ncpa.cpl

</PRE></OL>To work around the problem, put the Services for NetWare compact disc in
another computer's CD-ROM drive, share the drive, and install using the
remote CD-ROM drive.
<P>
ONLINE ADMINSTRATOR’S GUIDE:
<P>
Services for NetWare includes an online Administrator's Guide. To install
the online Administrator's Guide on your computer, copy all the files from
the \FPNW\NT40\ONLINE.DOC directory of the compact disc to a directory on
the hard drive.
<P>
To use the online book, double-click the MS-SFN.HLP file icon in the
Explorer, or specify that file in the Run command of the Start menu.
<P>
Remote Administration Tools for Windows 95 and Windows for Workgroups
<P>
This compact disc also contains remote administration tools, which can be
used to administer Windows NT Server from computers running Windows 95 and
Windows for Workgroups.
<P>
The tools in the \WIN95.RAD directory are for use on Windows 95 computers.
These tools include functionality to remotely administer File and Print
Services for NetWare, as well as Windows NT Server. For more information On
these tools, see \WIN95.RAD\SRVTOOLS.TXT, or see the online help by Typing
win32hlp d:\win95.rad\srvtools.hlp, where d: is the drive letter of the CD-
ROM.
<P>
The tools in the \WFW.RAD directory are for use on Windows for Workgroups
computers. These tools include functionality to remotely administer only
Windows NT Server. For more information on these tools, see
\WFW95.RAD\Readme.txt.
<P>
IMPORTANT -- Do not use previously released versions of these remote
administration tools to administer FPNW (NetWare-enabled ) users. These
previous versions may corrupt the user account information of FPNW users.
<P>
If you are using Windows NT Server remote administration tools on any
Windows 95 or Windows for Workgroups computers, update them to the versions
contained on this compact disc immediately.
<P>
MISCELLANEOUS NOTES
<P>
Removing FPNW
<P>
After you remove FPNW and reboot, the FPNW control panel application will
still be present. To remove the application, close the control panel, and
then delete the %systemroot%\system32\fpnwmgr.cpl file.
<P>
Incorrect Installation of Earlier FPNW Beta on Windows NT Server 4.0 RC
<P>
If you upgraded to Windows NT Server 4.0 RC, and then tried installing an
earlier Beta version of FPNW 4.0, you have an incorrect version of
fpnwclnt.dll installed. To expand and copy the correct version from the
Services for NetWare compact disc, type
<P>
<PRE>   expand  d:\fpnw\nt40\i386\fpnwclnt.dl_
   %systemroot%\system32\fpnwclnt.dll

</PRE>where d: is the CD-ROM drive.
<P>
NetWare Client 32TM Redirector
<P>
This release does not support Novell's NetWare Client 32 redirector. For
more information, please check the www.microsoft.com web site.
<P>
Two Check Boxes Are Mutually Exclusive
<P>
On a server running File and Print Services for NetWare, two check boxes
are mutually exclusive. These are the "Users Must Log On In Order To Change
Password" check box (in the Account Policy dialog box) and the "User Must
Change Password at Next Logon" check box (in the User Properties Dialog
box).
<P>
If the "Users Must Log On In Order To Change Password" check box is marked,
then users who have the "User Must Change Password at Next Logon" check box
marked in their accounts cannot use CHGPASS (or SETPASS or LOGIN) to change
their passwords after they have logged on to the server.
<P>
It is recommended that you do not select both these check boxes for File
and Print Services for NetWare users.
<P>
Using Windows NT Server as a Client to Connect to NetWare Servers
<P>
On a computer running Windows NT Server and File and Print Services for
NetWare, the automatic restoration of connections from that computer to
NetWare servers may not work if the computer does not have a preferred
server selected, and a user logs in immediately after booting the computer.
This happens because the Windows NT Server computer does not have time to
gather information about available NetWare servers before attempting to
restore connections.
<P>

Setting Up the Milan Network Print Server Device
<P>
To successfully set up File and Print Services for NetWare to print to a
printer attached to a Milan network print server device, use the following
procedure:

<OL><P><LI>Use the Printers folder to create a logical printer for the printer. Be
   sure to set the following in the Printer Properties dialog box:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - On the Ports tab, specify NetWareCompatiblePServer0 or
      NetWareCompatiblePServer1 as the port.

   are the last 6 characters of the Milan MAC address. You can find the
   address printed on the bottom of the device. Then click OK.

<P><LI>Back in the Print Servers On dialog box, select the print server you
   created in step 3, and then click Printers.

<P><LI>In the Printers on Print Server dialog box, click Add.

<P><LI>Fill out the Add Printer To dialog box with information for the printer.
   Be sure to specify Remote Other/Unknown in the Type box. Then click OK.

<P><LI>Back in the Printers on Print Server dialog box, click Queues, and add
   the queue you created in step 1.
<P>
</OL>Miscellaneous Printing Notes
<P>
If you find that print jobs sent from NetWare clients to File and Print
Services for NetWare printers are not printing banner sheets, or are not
notifying clients correctly, you should check certain printer properties.
<P>
To check the printer properties:

<OL><P><LI>Open the Printers folder.

<P><LI>Select the printer, and then choose Properties from the Printer menu.

<P><LI>On the Ports tab, check that the port is set correctly, to either a
   NetWareCompatiblePServer port or a local port, such as LPT1:

<P><LI>On the Sharing tab, check that the printer has been shared on the
   network.

<P><LI>On the General tab, click the Print Processor button, and then check
   that the print processor is set to "nwprint."

<P><LI>Click OK.

<P><LI>Close the Printers folder, and then stop and restart the File and Print
   Services for NetWare service.
<P>
</OL>Similarly, if you have two printer queues that use the same printer, and
one of the printer queues has the Job Type set to WINPRINT, then jobs in
that queue may freeze with the message "Waiting for PServer", causing both
queues to freeze. To correct this problem, stop and restart the print
server software, or stop and restart the File and Print Services for
NetWare service.
