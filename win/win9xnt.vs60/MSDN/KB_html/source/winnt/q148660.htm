The information in this article applies to:

<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5 and 3.51

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Windows NT Debug Symbols must be verified after starting the kernel
debugger (I386KD.EXE | WINDBG.EXE). The debugger may load and present
a prompt, but if the symbols are incorrect, future debugging commands
will not reference proper functions and variables which will lead to
sporadic results. Listed below are a few red flags and a couple of
methods to spot check validity of the symbols.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This article assumes that the kernel debugger is running and has loaded
a MEMORY.DMP file or is connected to a remote machine. Commands
presented will not be fully documented and only exerts from the output
will be shown.
<P>
Article Contents
 
<P>
-  Loading the Kernel Debugger
-  Checking Creation Time with !drivers
-  Using LINK.EXE to Check Creation Time
-  Unassembling a Function
-  Service Pack Symbols
<P>
Loading the Kernel Debugger
 
<P>
A normal load of the kernel debugger will display one of the following
prompts.
<PRE>     kd&gt;      Uniprocessor System
  0: kd&gt;      Multiprocessor System

</PRE>The prompt shown below indicates that the symbol file for the NTOSKRNL.EXE
is incorrect. Check to make sure that the appropriate multiprocessor or
uniprocessor kernel and HAL have been copied into the symbol tree.
<P>
Example:
<P>
Symbol search path is: C:\symbols
kd: crash dump initialized [c:\dump\memory.dmp]
cound not determine the current processor, using zero
Kernel Version 1057 Free loaded @ 0x80100000
Bugcheck 0000001e : c0000005 80151d5b 00000000 00000001
*** Contents Deleted ***
16kd&gt;
<P>
When the kernel debugger loads the MEMORY.DMP file. The Kernel Version
as well as the Processor Count is display in the first few lines. Confirm
that processor count corresponds with the appropriate kernel and HAL.
Driver symbol information is displayed as either the symbols are loaded or
deferred.
<P>
Sample Load:
<P>
Symbol search path is: C:\symbols
kd: crash dump initialized [c:\dump\memory.dmp]
Kernel Version 1057 Free loaded @ 0x80100000
Bugcheck 0000001e : c0000005 80151d5b 00000000 00000001

<PRE>80131ff8 b801000000       mov     eax,0x1
</PRE>kd&gt;
<P>
Note that the kernel debugger was "Unable to read image header for
Floppy.SYS at fc820000 - status c0000001." This message is normal since
the particular driver header is not currently in memory.
<P>
<P><h3>Checking Creation Time with !drivers</h3>
 
<P>
Use the !drivers command to list the drivers currently loaded in memory.
Make note of the dates and times of the drivers and whether or not they
could be loaded. (The Code Size and Data Size columns have been removed
to fit the width of the article.)

<P>
Note the Creation Time of the file which is the date the file was
compiled. This date will be close to the Date\Time Stamp on the actual
file when viewing the WINNT\SYSTEM32\DRIVERS subdirectory using file
manager.
<P>
If you subscribe to the Microsoft Developers Network (MSDN) or have the
Windows NT DDK (Device Driver Kit), the LINK.EXE utility can be used to
confirm that they DBG file is the same file that was created when the
driver was compiled. The "time date stamp" in the example below matches
the "Create Time" of netbios.sys in the output above.

<P><h3>Unassembling a Function</h3>
 
<P>
The symbol files enable the kernel debugger to reference functions and
global variables by name. Spot check a couple of unassembled functions
to make sure they look proper. Many functions are compiler optimized and
do not necessarily conform to the examples below. Compiler optimized
functions can be identified by the FPO in parenthesis in the function name.
<P>
Functions normally begin with either "push ebp" or "mov eax,
fs[000000000]."  Basic knowledge of machine language and experience will
enable one to recognize

<P><PRE>     x *!
</OL></PRE>2. List symbols for a particular module e.g. ntoskrnl.exe.
<PRE>     x nt!*
</PRE></OL>3. Select a function to unassemble that is not compiler optimized.

</PRE><h3>Good Symbols</h3>

80156bde 55               push    ebp
80156bdf 8bec             mov     ebp,esp
80156be1 6aff             push    0xff
80156be3 68200d1080       push    0x80100d20
80156be8 68304f1380       push    0x80134f30

</PRE>kd&gt;
<P>
The unassembly of the function should look similar to the text above;
however, the unassembly is subject to change. If the unassembly looks
proper, we can assume that the symbols have loaded properly for this
module.
<P>
The following unassembly begins with "jnz NT!_NTUnlockFile+0x22."
Obviously, the beginning of a function would not start with a jump
instruction code. Check the symbol tree once again.
<P>

</PRE><h3>Service Pack Symbols</h3>
 
<P>
There are times when it is difficult to match the symbols with a
particular installation. At some point in time, a service could have been
added which required copying files from the Windows NT Installation CD-ROM
which copied over files which were updated with a Service Pack. Be sure
to reapply the Service Pack and any 3rd Party Support Disks after changing
system setup which copies files from the Windows NT Installation CD-ROM.
The symbols should be applied in the same order as the installation.
