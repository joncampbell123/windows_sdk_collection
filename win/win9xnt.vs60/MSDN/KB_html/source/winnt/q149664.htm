The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5 and 3.51
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5 and 3.51
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If users are having problems getting validated or are experiencing other
account-related issues, you should verify that complete synchronization is
taking place across all domain controllers in the domain, including in the
User Account Database and Machine Account Database. Anytime a change is
made in User Manager or Server Manager, the changes occur at the primary
domain controller's database, and those changes need to be replicated.
<P>
The Netlogon Service tries to maintain synchronization automatically but is
sometimes unable to. If you suspect a domain controller is not up to date,
locate your situation in the section below and follow the procedures
outlined.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In User Manager, changing any of the following requires a complete domain
synchronization for all domain controllers in the domain to be able to
correctly service the Netlogon request:

<UL><LI>Creating a new user or group account
<LI>Changing a password or description
<LI>Changing domain or user policies
<LI>Changing group membership
<LI>Changing logon script file name
<LI>Changing home directory path
<LI>Changing hours of valid logon
<LI>changing the list of valid machines to be validated against
<LI>Changing account expiration and type
<P>
</UL>In Server Manager, doing any of the following requires a complete domain
synchronization for all domain controllers in the domain to be able to
correctly service the Netlogon request:

<UL><LI>Creating a new computer account for a Workstation
<LI>Creating a new computer account for a stand-alone Server
<LI>Creating a new computer account for a backup domain controller
<P>
</UL>In the case where the PDC has to be taken offline, full replication will
need to have already occurred before promotion of a BDC to PDC.  If the
synchronization did not occur, any new information not replicated is lost.
<P>
To verify Domain Synchronization, individually replicate the User Account
Database on each backup domain controller with the primary domain
controller.
<P>
From within Server Manager, select each BDC in turn and, from the Computer
menu, choose "Synchronize with primary domain controller." This will
trigger an immediate replication for the selected BDC with the PDC.
<P>
From the Event Log on each Domain Controller, verify that one or more of
the following is on each server (both event IDs do not need to be present
on each computer):
<P>
On the PDC:
<P>
<PRE>   Event 5711  Source Netlogon
   The partial synchronization request from the server &lt;BDC&gt; completed
   successfully. &lt;Number&gt; changes(s) has(have) been returned to the caller.

   Event 5713  Source Netlogon
   The full synchronization request from the server &lt;BDC&gt; completed
   successfully. &lt;Number&gt; object(s) has(have) been returned to the caller.

</PRE>On the BDC:
<P>
<PRE>   Event 5715 Source Netlogon The partial synchronization replication of
   the SAM database from the primary domain controller &lt;PDC&gt; completed
   successfully. &lt;Number&gt; change(s) is(are) applied to the database.

   Event 5717 Source Netlogon The full synchronization replication of the
   &lt;SAM or BUILTIN or LSA&gt; database from the primary domain controller
   &lt;PDC&gt; completed successfully.
