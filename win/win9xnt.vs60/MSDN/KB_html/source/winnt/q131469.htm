The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you have insufficient resources on your Windows NT Server system, one
or both of the following errors may appear on clients computers that are
trying to connect to the server:
<P>
<PRE>   Error 1723:  The RPC server is too busy to complete this operation.

   Error 1722:  The RPC server is unavailable.

</PRE>NOTE: These errors may appear in a windowed dialog box, or as a numbered
event error message in the system log on the client computer. The service
or utility running on the server at the time of the error determines how
the error appears on the client.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
If your server has more than 48 megabytes of RAM, the problem may occur
because PagedPoolSize is set too small. The static value for PagedPoolSize
is established when you install Windows NT.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
This has been corrected in Windows NT 3.51. When you upgrade your computer
from a previous version, if Windows NT Setup finds the value 0x03000000
(48 MB), it is reset to 0, which is the 3.51 default at installation time.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
You may be able to work around this problem by increasing the
PagedPoolSize value in the registry.
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them.
Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of
Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.
<P>
To correct this problem:

<OL><P><LI>Shutdown Windows NT.

<P><LI>Turn the server off and then turn it back on.

<P><LI>Start Windows NT.

<P><LI>Run Registry Editor (REGEDT32.EXE).

<P><LI>From the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following key:
<P>
<P><PRE>      \SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Memory Management
</PRE><P>
   You will find that the value for PagedPoolSize is 0x03000000 (48MB).

<P><LI>Set PagePoolSize to zero.

<P><LI>Shutdown and restart Windows NT.
<P>
</OL>When PagedPoolSize is set to zero, Windows NT automatically calculates a
new value based on the amount of physical memory installed.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The small PagedPoolSize is only one of several potential triggers, or
first causes, that affect the operation of SERVICES.EXE. The "RPC server is
too busy..." and "RPC server unavailable..." messages indicate that
SERVICES.EXE or one of its threads may have hung. A thread may remain in a
blocking state and appear to be hung if a resource is not available.
<P>
SERVICES.EXE is a process that functions as the service control manager.
It also runs a variety of Windows NT user mode functions as threads
including server, browsing, event log, and RPC services. The symptoms are
typically returned by workstations performing commands (including net view,
event log, and other related RPC requests). Client RPC requests to the pipe
\SRVSVC, result in Server Message Block (SMB) errors returned with
STATUS_PIPE_NOT_AVAILABLE by the server.

</PRE></OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Advanced Server
version 3.1 and Windows NT Server version 3.5. This problem has been
resolved in Windows NT version 3.51.
