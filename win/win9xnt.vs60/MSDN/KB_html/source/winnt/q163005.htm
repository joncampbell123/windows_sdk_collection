The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 Service Pack 2
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 Service Pack 2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The Compaq Advanced Network Control utility included on Compaq's support
software disk (SSD) 1.18 or later (up to SSD 1.20a at the time this article
was written) fails to work properly after applying Windows NT 4.0 Service
Pack 2. The utility starts up after some time, but does not have all the
information it had before the service pack was applied. The utility fails
whether it is installed before or after the service pack has been applied.
Removing the service pack causes the utility to start working correctly
again.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this problem, do either of the following:

<UL><LI>Obtain the hotfix mentioned in the STATUS section of this article.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Use the Netflx3.sys driver that comes with the Windows NT 4.0 Service
   Pack 2 media. There is a new Netflx3.sys driver (version 1.51) in the
   Drvlib\Netcard\Netflx3 directory. Because this is a Drvlib (OEM) driver,
   there is no mechanism to automatically update the service pack
   installation with the new driver. In other words, you must manually copy
   the Netflx3.sys driver that comes with the service pack to the target
   system. When this is done, the Compaq utility works as expected.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0
Service Pack 2.
A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-
tested and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific
problem. Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem,
Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains
this fix. Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Compaq Advanced Network Utility uses a graphical user interface (GUI)
that allows a user to install, configure, update, and monitor the status of
all Compaq network controllers containing the TLAN chip set. It uses the
Netflx3.sys file to configure network controllers for redundancy or stand-
alone configurations.
