<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you attempt to regenerate an orphaned drive (stripe set with parity),
the following error message appears:
<P>
<PRE>   The drive cannot be locked for exclusive use. Please check to see if
   some applications are currently accessing the drive. If so, close them
   and try again.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs if Disk Administrator is not allowed exclusive access
to the stripe set volume. This is usually caused by having an open file on
the volume you are trying to regenerate.
<P>
A file is open when:

<UL><LI>A paging file is located on the volume.
<LI>An application that was started from the volume is still running.
<LI>An application that is running has loaded a .DLL file from the volume.
<LI>An application has a file open on the volume.
<LI>An application's current directory is on the volume.
<P>
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To correct this problem:
<P>
If the error continues to appear after you have stopped all applications
and services that could be accessing the volume:

<OL><P><LI>Remove the Page File.
<P>
   If there is a page file on the volume, define a page file of sufficient
   size on another volume and reboot the computer.

<P><LI>If you were running Microsoft Mail and or Schedule+, start Mail and
   choose Exit and Sign Out from the file menu.
<P>
   Microsoft Mail and or Schedule+ have hidden processes that run in the
   background.

<P><LI>If you run a Systems Management Server client, close the two hidden
   Systems Management Server processes: APPCTL32 and PCMWIN32.
<P>
   Use KILL.EXE from the PSSTOOLS directory on the Systems Management
   Server CD, or Process Viewer from the Windows NT Resource Kit to
   terminate the processes.

<P><LI>If you log on to the machine with any logon script containing  any
   Systems Management Server batch file, then remove the batch file from
   the logon script and log on again before starting the
   regeneration.

<P><LI>To make the volume inaccessible to any processes and to ensure disk
   administrator can lock the volume, go into Disk Administrator, select
   Tools, Assign Drive Letter, click the "Do not assign a drive letter"
   radio button, click OK, select Partition from the menu and then select
   Commit Changes Now, exit Disk Administrator, reboot the system and then
   try to regenerate the stripe set with parity.
