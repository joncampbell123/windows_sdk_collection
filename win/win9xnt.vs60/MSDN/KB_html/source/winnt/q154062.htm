<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article documents how to connect to a PPTP enabled server across the
Internet, while connecting to a non-PPTP enabled Internet Service Provider
(ISP).
<P>
PPTP enables implementation of secure, multiprotocol Virtual Private
Networks (VPNs) through public data networks such as the Internet. Through
PPTP, it is possible for remote users to access their corporate networks
and applications by dialing into the local ISP's Point of Presence (POP),
instead of dialing directly into the company network. PPTP connects
directly to the target server by creating a virtual network for each
remote
client, one that the Windows NT Server 4.0 administrator can monitor and
manage like any other Remote Access port.
<P>
MORE INFORMATION
 
<P>
Before you make a connection, in order to use PPTP to connect to a server
securely across the Internet, the PPTP protocol must be loaded. To load
the
PPTP protocol, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>In Control Panel, double-click the Network icon and go to the Protocols
   tab.

<P><LI>Add PPTP.

<P><LI>After the protocol is loaded, remote access services (RAS) will be
   invoked. You must add at least one Virtual Private Network port as a
   port in the RAS setup interface.

<P><LI>At this time, specify which protocols will run for that VPN port. You
   may install up to 256 VPN ports. Each VPN can be connected to a
</OL>network.

<OL><P><LI>Make sure that at least one VPN is configured for dial-out. One other
   consideration is that you must know what protocol is used on the
   receiving PPTP server, and select that protocol and configure it for
</OL>the
<PRE>   VPN port.


</PRE></OL>To make the connection, do the following:
<P>

<OL><P><LI>Assuming that you have a phone book entry for your ISP, create a phone
   book entry for the PPTP server. The actual phone number will be the
</OL>name
<PRE>   of the host or an IP address. Using the IP address of the PPTP RAS
   server is ideal. There may be name resolution considerations otherwise.
   Make sure that the Dial Using dialog has a RASPPTPM VPN port assigned
</PRE></OL>to
<PRE>   it.

</PRE><P><LI>Dial the ISP using the standard phone book entry created for the ISP.
   When you have established a connection, dial the IP address or host
</OL>name
<PRE>   of the computer.

</PRE></OL>NOTE: If the PPTP client, for example a laptop, has a network adapter
installed and normally participates on the remote network you are dialing,
you may need to add a route to the route table to make sure that packets
destined for the remote PPTP server are routed through the correct
interface.
