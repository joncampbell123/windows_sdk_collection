The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In an environment that relies on Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) to
resolve NetBIOS names, the error message "There are no logon servers
available to service the logon request" appears if you are an
administrator and you do one or more of the following:

<UL><LI>You attempt to remotely administer a trusted domain. For example, you
   use File Manager to assign share permissions to users from the trusted
   domain.

<LI>You attempt to select the trusted domain in User Manager for Domains.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The WINS database does not have the proper domain registrations for pass-
through authentication. See the more information section below for more
details.
<P>
This problem occurs most often in environments where the administrator has
created a two-way trust between two previously independent domains. Most
often, there are WINS servers in each domain and the WINS servers do not
replicate their databases to each other.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this problem:

<UL><LI>Allow WINS dynamic registration.
<P>
   This ensures that Domain Controllers register their DOMAIN&lt;1C&gt; NetBIOS
   names with the WINS Server.

<LI>Make certain that WINS database replication is successful between WINS
   Servers. Missing database entries for domain names may indicate
   Problems with the WINS Servers and replication.
<P>
</UL>To work around this problem:
<P>
<PRE>   NOTE: Microsoft does not recommend using static mappings in the WINS
   database for WINS enabled computers.

</PRE><P><LI>Run the WINS Administration Utility to add static mappings for the
   Domain&lt;1C&gt; registrations (of the trusted domain) that are not listed in
   the WINS database:
<P>
<PRE>      Name:        Master DOMAIN Name
      IP Address:  Address of the Primary Domain Controller (PDC) of the
                   domain
      Type:        Internet Group

</PRE></OL>If you are logged on as an administrator at a Domain Controller, remote
administration works now successfully. If you are attempting to remotely
administer the domain while logged on to a Server (not a domain
controller) or Windows NT Workstation, you must add DOMAIN&lt;1C&gt; entries for
both the trusted and trusting domains.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To remotely administer a trusted domain, several pass-through
authentication steps must take place. If the WINS database does not have
the proper domain registrations, the pass-through authentication fails.
<P>
For example, a trust is established between DOMAIN_A and DOMAIN_B. Server
PDC_A is in DOMAIN_A and PDC_B is in DOMAIN_B. DOMAIN_A is the trusted
(master) domain, and DOMAIN_B is the resource (trusting) domain. To
establish this trust relationship, the following NetBIOS names must be
resolved to IP addresses, either through WINS or broadcast:
<P>
<PRE>   NetBIOS Name      Description of Use of Name
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   DOMAIN_A&lt;1B&gt;      PDC_B uses this to query the PDC of DOMAIN_A
   PDC_A&lt;00&gt;         PDC_B uses this to set up a session with the PDC of
                     DOMAIN_A
   DOMAIN_A&lt;1D&gt;      PDC_B uses this to get DC list of DOMAIN_A

</PRE>With these three names being registered, and if your account has
administrator priviledges, the trust can be established and the message
"The trust relationship was established successfully" appears. When you
reboot the computer, or the first time you attempt remote administration,
another NetBIOS name is needed:
<P>
<PRE>   NetBIOS Name   Description of Use of Name
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------

   DOMAIN_A&lt;1C&gt;   Each Domain Controller in DOMAIN_B uses this name to
                  establish a secure channel with a Domain Controller in
                  the trusted domain.

</PRE>The Domain Controller (DC) in the trusting domain attempts to create a
secure channel with any DC in the trusted domain by making a multicast
logon request to the NetBIOS name DOMAIN_A&lt;1C&gt;. This logon request is part
of a process that creates a Secure Channel between the two DCs. The logon
ID in this logon request is the inter-domain trust account for the
trusting domain, DOMAIN_B$. If there is no registration for DOMAIN_A&lt;1C&gt;
in the WINS database the error message STATUS_NO_LOGON_SERVERS is returned
to the call. The message "There are currently no logon servers available"
is then returned to the user.
<P>

WINS, please see the following article(s) in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
