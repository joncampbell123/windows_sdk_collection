<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Many computers cannot access more than 528 MB of data on IDE drives, which
is by design. However, some third-party software programs can allow access
of data beyond the 528 MB limit such as On Track Disk Manager. Some
hardware manufacturers have introduced enhancements to the BIOS and the IDE
controllers so that data can be virtually accessed through Logical Block
Addressing (LBA). If the hardware manufacturer of your computer does not
provide this feature, you may want to upgrade your BIOS to the Disk
Extender.
<P>
For more information, contact American Megatrends, Inc., at (800) 828-9264
or (404) 263-9381.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Most large IDE drives support LBA. One of Disk Extender's preferred
requirements is that the computer supports LBA for its IDE drives. If your
computer does not provide this support, Disk Extender uses Block Transfer
Mode for the IDE drives so that data can be accessed beyond 528 MB. Disk
Extender works with any of the Microsoft operating systems and supports up
to four IDE hard drives on a system.
<P>
The following information lists additional features of the AMI Disk
Extender:

<UL><LI>Supports up to two IDE Controllers (primary and secondary).

<LI>Supports up to two IDE drives (master and slave) for each IDE
   controller, a total of four IDE drives.

<LI>Supports IDE LBA mode drives with capacities greater than 528MB.

<LI>Needs no additional support from the system BIOS.

<LI>Works with any system BIOS.

<LI>Derived from AMI BIOS.

<LI>Requires no configuration; auto detects and configures IDE drives.
<P>
</UL>The complete reference to the board is called:

   IDE BIOS Extension
<P>
   -or-

<LI>AMI Disk Extender

licenses it to AMI.
