<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Files opened with a UNC name may be closed prematurely. This problem only
occurs when a directory that is part of the UNC path is subsequently
connected and then disconnected.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When the UNC file is opened, a tree ID is created by the server and is sent
to the client Redirector. The tree ID represents the root or mount point on
the server. In the above example, a tree ID will be returned for the
directory dir. For file references, the Redirector includes the tree ID to
tell the server where the path starts on the server. A tree ID has to be
obtained before files can be accessed on the server. A tree ID is also
needed to access a directory mapped to a drive letter. For optimization,
the server will return the same tree ID for both accesses. The problem
occurs on the net use /d. The Redirector will send a tree disconnect
request to the server. This request closes all files in the tree, even
files opened with UNC names.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this problem, obtain the following fix or wait for the next
Windows NT service pack.
