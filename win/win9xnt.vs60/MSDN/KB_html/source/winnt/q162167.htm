<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article outlines the relationship between Windows NT and the new I2O
input/output (I/O) controller specification.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>What is I2O?</h3>
 
<P>
I2O is a specification that allows for intelligent input/output operation.
A controller that is compatible with this specification can now support
hardware interrupt requests (IRQs) above 15. Current implementations for
this specification are appearing in dual-processor, Pentium Pro
motherboards by such companies as Micron and SuperMicro. In these new
motherboards, the I2O specification is being implemented in two parts: a
PCI I/0 controller utilizing an i960 controller, and a software component
consisting of a hardware abstraction layer allowing for up to 256 hardware
IRQs.
<P>
<P><h3>What effect do these additional IRQs have on Windows NT's functionality?</h3>
 
<P>
Support for I2O is not implemented directly in Windows NT's kernel. Rather,
support for these additional IRQs is being implemented at the individual
device driver level. If the device driver is not written to support the
higher IRQs, then Windows NT will not use the device.
<P>
<P><h3>How can I tell if a device is using an I2O controller?</h3>
 
<P>
When you check the I/O properties on the device in Windows NT Diagnostics,
it will show an IRQ for that device that is above 15. Windows NT recognizes
that it has been assigned the IRQ, it just does not know how to use it.
<P>
What can I do if I have a device that is using these higher IRQs but no
 
<P><h3>device driver has been written to support it?</h3>
 
<P>
Three options exist:

<OL><P><LI>Disable the I2O controller. This cannot be done on all motherboards.
</OL>You will have to check with the manufacturer to determine if this can
be done.

<OL><P><LI>Contact the manufacturer to see if it has an updated device driver
</OL>which supports the new I/O controller.

<OL><P><LI>Use a device that does support the controller.
<P>
</OL><h3>For More Information</h3>
