The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system, version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1

<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In Windows NT, you can do the following:

<UL><LI>Change the computer name of a Windows NT Advanced Server computer
<LI>Change the computer name of a workstation in a domain
<LI>Change the computer name of a server in a domain
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Changing Computer Names of Windows NT Advanced Server Computers</h3>
 
<P>
In Windows NT Advanced Server domains, domain membership (whether as
workstation or server) is represented by a special system and security
(SAM) account on the domain and an LSA Secret Object on the
workstation or server.
<P>
Both the account and the secret object contain a password that is used
by the Netlogon services to set up a secure channel between the
machines. Netlogon periodically changes the password (both in the
Secret Object and for the account on the domain) to prevent the
password from being discovered.
<P>
The account on the server is marked with a special bit (either
WORKSTATION TRUST ACCOUNT or SERVER TRUST ACCOUNT). These accounts
cannot be used to logon interactively, nor can they be used to set up
a connection using NET USE. If this is attempted, an error will be
returned, ERROR_NOLOGON_WORKSTATION_TRUST_ACCOUNT or
ERROR_NOLOGON_SERVER_TRUST_ACCOUNT.
<P>
The LSA Secret Object is created by setup during the initial
installation or when a workstation joins a domain. The initial
password is the same as the computer name (in lowercase and truncated
to 14 characters).
<P>
The SAM machine account is created by Server Manager when a
workstation or server is added to the domain (or by Setup when an
administratrive user name and password are specified). The password is
the same as the computer name (in lowercase and truncated to 14
characters).
<P>
For Netlogon to start on a workstation or server, the passwords on the
Secret Object and on the account on the domain must be the same.
<P>
<P><h3>Changing the Computer Name of a Workstation in a Domain</h3>
 
<P>
The correct way to change the computer name of a workstation in a
domain is as follows:

<OL><P><LI>On the domain, run Server Manager to add a workstation with the new
   name.

<P><LI>Choose the Network icon in Control Panel, and then leave the
   current domain (join a workgroup of any name).

<P><LI>Change the computer name.

<P><LI>Reboot the computer.

<P><LI>Choose the Network icon in Control Panel, and then rejoin the
   domain.

<P><LI>Reboot the computer.

<P><LI>On the Domain, run Server Manager and delete the old workstation
   name.
<P>
</OL><h3>Changing the Computer Name of a Server in a Domain</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>On the domain, run Server Manager to add a server with the new
   name.

<P><LI>Choose the Network icon in Control Panel, and then change the
   computer name.

<P><LI>Reboot the computer.
<P>
   NOTE: If you try to skip this step, Netlogon does not start on the
   server.

<P><LI>On the server, run Server Manager and choose Synchronize With
   Domain Controller from the Computer menu. This resets the passwords on
   both the account and the Secret Object to the same password.

<P><LI>On the domain, run Server Manager and delete the old server name.
<P></OL>
