<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
QmodemPro for Windows is a communications package that includes the ability
to send faxes with configurable cover pages via a fax modem. This package
also works with Windows NT.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Most Windows fax software packages implement their fax capabilities as a
Windows printer driver. This offers the ability to fax anything that can be
printed from any Windows application. The reason that these applications do
not function in Windows NT is that the printer drivers are different; they
must be specifically designed for Windows NT. As such, printer drivers,
including those in fax packages, that were created for Windows do not
function in Windows NT.
<P>
QmodemPro uses a different approach to send faxes. Rather than being
implemented as a printer driver, it simply reads a file and converts it to
a raster format which it can then send out as a fax. The main disadvantage
of this method is that QmodemPro is very limited in the types of files that
it can send as a fax. Currently, QmodemPro can send only ASCII text files,
BMP graphics, and PCX graphic formats.
