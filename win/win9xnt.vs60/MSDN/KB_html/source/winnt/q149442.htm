<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If the component files used by an application are created on a shared
network drive, the links established in the compound documents do not
contain relative path specifications. An application based on the exchange
of data between the various documents through OLE links will exhibit the
following symptoms: If the users move the client files to their local
drives, the links between the component files cannot be reestablished
without unreasonable user intervention, and the application cannot function
properly. The application will report various errors, such as "file not
found."
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When the component files are created on or saved to the network directory
and then moved to identical relative positions on a different machine, the
OLE links in compound documents are being broken. The same functionality
works correctly if the files are originally created on the local drive.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51.
This problem was corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT.
