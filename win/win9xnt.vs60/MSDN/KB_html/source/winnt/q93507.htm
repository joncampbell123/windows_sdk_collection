WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them.
Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of
Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Your Sound Blaster card may continuously play a .WAV file. This may be
caused by a hardware conflict with your computer. The Sound Blaster
card is known to have compatibility problems with some fast 80486
systems and some system chip sets. Such a system may be unable to run
these devices. This problem may also be caused by IRQ or DMA channel
conflicts with another device.
<P>
If this is not a hardware problem but is a conflict, change the
settings for either the sound card or the conflicting device. The
recommended settings for the sound card are DMA1, IRQ7, and port 220h.
Note: LPT1 often uses IRQ7, so it may be necessary to use another IRQ
(interrupt request line). If you are unable to resolve any conflicts
that occur, remove or disable one of the devices in the Registry
database.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Registry Editor (REGEDT32) is provided for altering the Registry database.
Note that you must be logged on with administrative permissions to alter
certain Registry settings. You can alter hardware configuration settings
under the Registry key:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE-&gt;SYSTEM-&gt;ControlSet001-&gt;Services

</PRE>You can disable or enable the Sound Blaster card by changing the entry for
the sub-branch
<P>
<PRE>   Sndblst-&gt;Start

</PRE>to:
<P>
<PRE>   0x4 or 0x1

</PRE>Sound Blaster is manufactured by a vendor independent of Microsoft; we
make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
performance or reliability.
