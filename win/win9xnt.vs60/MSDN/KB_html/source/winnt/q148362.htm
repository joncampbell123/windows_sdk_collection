The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5 and 3.51
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5 and 3.51
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
You can configure two Windows NT computers with EiconCards back-to-back
using a null modem cable. You can set up the two computers so that Windows
NT Remote Access Services (RAS) can be used to make a connection over the
null modem cable that connects the two EiconCards.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 

<OL><P><LI>Make sure both EiconCards support the null modem cable you will be
    using. Cable requirements may be different for different models on
    EiconCards.

<P><LI>One computer must be configured to use internal clocking and the
    other computer must be configured to use external clocking. To
    configure the type of clocking, run Eicon's WAN Services
    Configuration program and go to the Sync Driver Configuration
    panel.

<P><LI>Configure the internal clocking computer to use DCE addressing.
    Configure the external clocking computer to use DTE addressing. To
    configure DTE/DCE Addressing, go to the Sync Driver Configuration panel
    in the WAN Services Configuration program.

<P><LI>Make sure all X.25 and HDLC panel settings are the same on both
   computers.

<P><LI>Verify the Eicon X.PAD driver is installed in the Network Control Panel
    Applet (NCPA) on both computers. If X.PAD is not installed, install it.
    Consult your Eicon documentation for installation instructions.

<P><LI>Configure the X.PAD driver and a COM port on both computers. Leave all
    X.PAD configuration settings for the ports at their default values.

<P><LI>Configure RAS in NCPA on both computers. Add the port you configured in
    the X.PAD driver. Select Eicon X.PAD as the device. Make sure the port
    on one computer is set for dialout and the port on the other computer
    is set to receive calls.

<P><LI>Restart both computers when prompted.

<P><LI>Create an entry in the RAS Phonebook application on one computer and
    configure it to use the port you configured within the X.PAD driver.

<P><LI>Dial the entry you have created, using an account that has been
    granted RAS dial-in permission on the other computer.
<P>
</OL>You should now have a connection between the two computers using RAS.
