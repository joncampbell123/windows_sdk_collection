SUMMARY
 
<P>
Section 3.3 of Internet IETF's RFC 1541 (in Standards Track) has defined
the minimum lease duration as one hour. Microsoft Windows NT DHCP Service
Scheme has been designed to allow a network administrator to assign a lease
duration shorter than one hour for testing purposes. For production
systems, the minimum one hour specification should be abided by.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If a network that has had many changes occur and has had a high ratio
between connected computers and available IP addresses, a DHCP
Administrator may want to assign a shorter lease time to clients. The more
changes that occur, and the higher the ratio, the shorter a lease needs to
be.
<P>
But, if using a DHCP lease duration of less than one hour, the DHCP system
may function irregularly. A lease duration of less than one hour might
cause a DHCP server to have unexpected behavior in responding to lease
renewal and binding. The error may not occur 100 percent of the time.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Always assign a lease duration longer than one hour for production systems
in real work environments.
