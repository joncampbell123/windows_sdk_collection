</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When the number of Microsoft Exchange Server sites in one organization
reaches 213 or more, a knowledge consistency check (KCC) will fail with the
following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   The knowledge consistency check did not correct directory
   inconsistencies.

   Be sure the directory service is running, and then try again. If the
   error occurs, try stopping the directory service and the administrator
   program and then restarting them. To view details of the error, see the
   application event log in the Windows NT Event Viewer on the Microsoft
   Exchange Server computer on which you checked knowledge consistency.

</PRE>Several of the following Event IDs will appear in the Windows NT Event
Viewer Application log if diagnostics logging is set to maximum:
<P>
<PRE>   Event ID: 1171
   Exception e0010004 has occurred with parameters -1026 and 0 (Internal ID
   2060400). Please contact Microsoft Product Support Services for
   assistance.

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. We are currently researching this problem and will post more
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service
Pack for Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on
obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

</PRE><h3>Important Notes</h3>
 

<UL><LI>This fix must be installed on every Microsoft Exchange Server computer
   in your organization. In addition, you cannot reinstall a previous
   version of Dsamain.exe on any of your Microsoft Exchange Server
   computers. If you do so, the Microsoft Exchange Server directory will
   be damaged beyond repair.

<LI>This fix must be installed before the limit is reached. The fix does
   not repair damage that occurs when the limit is reached prior to
   installing the fix.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
For more information about how to set the Diagnostics Logging level, please
refer to the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator's Guide, chapter 17.
