The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Exchange message transfer agents (MTAs) may not be able to
establish a connection when the MTA that is being called (hereafter
referred to as the called MTA) has a password defined in the X.400
Connector's override page.
<P>
This password matches the one that is defined for the called MTA at the MTA
that initiates the connection (hereafter referred to as the calling MTA).
Messages destined to the called MTA will not be sent and will eventually
time out, in which case a non-delivery report (NDR) is generated. With the
default MTA diagnostics logging (NONE), the calling MTA will log for each
connection attempt the following warning in the Windows NT event log:
<P>
<PRE>   Event ID: 48
   Source: MSExchangeMTA
   Category: Security
   An error occurred authenticating credentials from the remote entity
   /O=DIETERR/OU=ROCKLAND/CN=CONFIGURATION/CN=CONNECTIONS/CN=ROCKKITE.
   [2007 MTA XFER-IN 23 42] (14)

</PRE>The called MTA does not log any entry in the Windows NT event log.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The MTA passwords exchanged during connection establishment might not
match. The called MTA uses the password as specified on the MTA General tab
instead of the one specified in the X.400 Connector's Override page. If
these passwords are different, the wrong password is sent in the RT Open
Accept Packet to the calling MTA and connection fails.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem:

<UL><LI>Do not define different passwords in the MTA General tab and the
   X.400 Connector' s Override property page at the called MTA.
<P>
</UL>If for any reasons different passwords must be used, there is no
workaround.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0.
This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange 4.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):
<P>
<PRE>   S E R V P A C K

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Successful X.400 connection establishment of two MTAs requires not only the
calling MTA to provide its MTA name and password, the called MTA has to
send an RT Open Accept Packet that contains its MTA name and its password.
Both sides must have the correct values defined to allow for a successful
connection.
<P>
NOTE: The problem described in this article only occurs if the called MTA
has different passwords defined on its MTA General tab and the X.400
Connector' s property page. If the calling MTA has different passwords
defined in its property pages the connection will be established and
messages can be transmitted.
