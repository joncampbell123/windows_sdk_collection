<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you attempt to upgrade Microsoft Exchange Server versions 4.0 or 5.0
to Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5, errors may occur and you receive
one of the following error messages:
<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft Exchange Server Setup
   An internal initialization error occurred in the database
   upgrade process.
   Microsoft Exchange Server Setup
   ID: no. c1032bfc
   &lt;OK&gt;

   Microsoft Exchange Server Setup
   ERROR: Your upgrade did not complete successfully. Please restart your
   Microsoft Exchange Services and your system will behave as it did before
   the upgrade was attempted.
   Please contact Microsoft Product Support Services for more information.
   Microsoft Exchange Server Setup
   ID: no. c1032c07
   &lt;OK&gt;

   Microsoft Exchange Server Setup
   ERROR: Your upgrade did not complete successfully. Please restart your
   Microsoft Exchange Services and your system will behave as it did before
   the upgrade was attempted.
   Please contact Microsoft Product Support Services for more information.
   Microsoft Exchange Server Setup
   ID: no. c1032c08
   &lt;OK&gt;

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When certain virus checking programs are installed, they add various File
System Filters as devices. These devices are enabled automatically (or when
the server is started) and prevent JET 97 (ESE), the Microsoft Exchange
Server 5.5 database, from installing and functioning correctly.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
The workaround that is presented below will allow the setup program
complete the upgrade to Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5. However, to
ensure that Microsoft Exchange Server database utilities will function
properly, you should obtain and install a post-Service Pack 3 hotfix for
Windows NT 4.0 before you restart any virus software programs on a
Microsoft Exchange 5.5 Server computer.

<OL><P><LI>Disable the anti-virus software. Double-click the Services icon in
   Control Panel to set the appropriate services to Disabled.

<P><LI>Disable the system devices. Double-click the Devices icon in Control
   Panel. Set the appropriate system devices to Disabled.

<P><LI>Stop all Microsoft Exchange Server Services and set them to Manual
   startup.

<P><LI>Restart the server and then proceed with the upgrade.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows NT Server
version 4.0 Service Pack 3.
A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-
tested and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific
problem. Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem,
Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains
this fix. Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
<P>
This hotfix is included in the Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 post-
Service Pack 3 rollup hotfixes which are available at the following FTP
site:

   public/fixes/usa/nt40/hotfixes-postSP3/roll-up

</PRE></OL>NOTE: Review the Readme.txt file in that directory before you attempt to
install the hotfixes.
