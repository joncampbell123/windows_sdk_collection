<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If you receive messages that have been sent to a logical grouping of
individuals, but this group of users is not defined as a distribution list
in the global address list, it can be time consuming to address new mail to
the group. To save this list of users for later use, you can create a
personal distribution list to be stored in your personal address book.
Rather than manually adding each of the names, perform the following steps
in the Microsoft Exchange client to quickly convert a list of recipients to
a distribution list:

<OL><P><LI>Open the message with the desired To:, Cc:, or Bcc: list. Double-click
   the From: field.

<P><LI>Select the entries in the To, Cc, or Bcc list and press CTRL+C to
   copy the list to the Clipboard.

<P><LI>Close the open message.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, choose Address Book.

<P><LI>In the Address Book, choose New Entry on the File menu.
<P>
   (In the MS-DOS client, choose the New button.)

<P><LI>Choose Personal Distribution List as the type of entry and click
   OK.

<P><LI>In the Properties For New Personal Distribution List window, type a name
   for the personal distribution list and click the Add/Remove Members
   button.
<P>
   (In the MS-DOS client, type a name for the personal distribution list in
   the Personal Distribution List window and click the Edit button.)

<P><LI>In the Edit New Personal Distribution List Members window, place the
   mouse pointer in the Members pane and press CTRL+V to paste.
<P>
   (In the MS-DOS client, place the cursor in the pane to the right of the
   Add button and press CTRL+V to paste.)

<P><LI>Click OK or Close for each open window until you return to the main
   Microsoft Exchange client window.
<P>
</OL>In the future, you can address mail to this group by selecting the
personal distribution list defined above.
<P>
NOTE: This method does not work if the names you are pasting into the
personal distribution list do not already exist in the Global address list.
