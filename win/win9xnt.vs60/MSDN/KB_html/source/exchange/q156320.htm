<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you try to open a form installed in a Public Folder for which you have
contributor privileges, the following error message may appear:
<P>
<PRE>   The folder could not be opened. You need additional permission
   to perform this operation. See your administrator.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The behavior is due to the design of the Public Folder permission
hierarchy and how forms are composed.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, try one of the following.

<OL><P><LI>Add the Public Folder to the Global Address List (GAL).
<P>
   a. In the Admin.exe program, select the properties for the Public
<P><PRE>      Folder.
</PRE><P>
   b. On the Advanced tab, clear the "Hide from Address Book" check box.

<P><LI>Create the form as a send form instead of a post form and mail it to the
   Public Folder.
<P>
</OL>-or-

<UL><LI>If the form has already been designed as a post form (and has
   not been extended):

</UL><OL><P><LI>Create a new send form.

<P><LI>Copy and paste the controls from the old form to the new form.
<P>
</OL>-or-
<P>
If the form must be a post form, try one of the following two workarounds:

<OL><P><LI>Configure, at minimum, Reviewer privileges for all accounts
   that will contribute.

<P><LI>Create a rule in the public folder that contains the folder
   application, to auto forward all items to another Public Folder that
   only a selected few have privileges to.
<P>
</OL>-or-

<OL><P><LI>Install the folder application to an accessible folder (like a personal
   folder).

<P><LI>After starting the form from the personal folder, submit the item and
   drag it from the accessible folder to the destination Public Folder,
   which also contains the same folder application.
