The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
A message from a Microsoft Exchange user to a recipient on a remote X.400
system may be routed to a local recipient. This can happen if the address
of the local recipient and the recipient on the remote X.400 system are
similar. For example, the local recipient has the following X.400 address:
<P>
<PRE>   C=US;A=PTT;P=COMPANY;S=USER1

</PRE>and the address of the remote X.400 recipient is:
<P>
<PRE>   C=US;A=PTT;S=USER1

</PRE>Note that the remote address matches the address of the local recipient,
except that there is no Private Management Domain (P=...) defined. Both
addresses are syntactically correct and valid.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 uses a slightly different algorithm
for address resolution. Even if the registry key Allow Fuzzy Proxy Search
is disabled, it still uses a fuzzy algorithm in certain cases.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0.
This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on obtaining the
Service Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base (without the spaces):
<P>
<PRE>   S E R V P A C K

</PRE><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor
can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.
<P>
To resolve this problem, apply the fix referenced below. You will also need
to create a new entry in the Windows NT registry. To do this:

<OL><P><LI>Start the Windows NT Registry Editor.
</OL>2. Go to the following subkey:
<P>
<PRE>   \HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeMTA\
    Parameters

</PRE><P><LI>Create the new registry value as:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Allow fuzzy proxy search
</PRE><P>
   and set it to 2. This case-sensitive registry value is a DWORD.
<P>
</OL>If this Registry value does not exist in the registry, the Microsoft
Exchange Message Transfer Agent (MTA) will assume a value of 1 for this
setting and thus fuzzy proxy searches are enabled.
<P>
This value has three possible settings:

<OL><P><LI>Allow fuzzy proxy search=0. Restricted fuzzy proxy search allowed. A
   unique match on the Surname and the Given Name or an exact match is
   allowed.
</OL>2. Allow fuzzy proxy search=1. Full fuzzy proxy search.
3. Allow fuzzy proxy search=2. No fuzzy proxy search at all, only an exact
<PRE>   match is allowed.

</PRE></OL><h2>REFERENCES</h2>

Server,
