<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0 and 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
You install the Exchange Server Administrator program on a computer that is
not running Exchange Services. When you press the Browse button, the
following error message may be returned if no Exchange Server name is
provided.
<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft Exchange Administrator

   The list of Microsoft Exchange Server computers is not available because
   no Microsoft Exchange Server computer could be located.

   Microsoft Exchange Administrator
   ID no c10312c8

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The most common reason for this error message is that the primary domain
controller (PDC) for the domain the computer is a member of is not in the
same network segment as an Exchange server.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To ensure reliable browsing, do one of the following:

<UL><LI>Provide a default server name before pressing the Browse button.
<P>
   -OR-

<LI>Locate an Exchange Server computer on the same network segment as the
   PDC.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When the Browse button is pressed, Microsoft Exchange Administrator
performs the following actions in an effort to return the Exchange
Organization hierarchy.

<OL><P><LI>If a server name was specified in the Administrator program's Connect to
</OL>Server dialog box before the Browse button was pressed, the Administrator
program attempts to use this server name.

<OL><P><LI>If no server name was specified, the Administrator program tries to find
   the Exchange Server computer on the local system.

<P><LI>If it fails to find the Exchange Server computer on the local system,
   the Administrator program tries the default server name in the registry
   (if one was entered previously through the Administrator program user
   interface).

<P><LI>The Administrator program then tries the RPC Locator service, requesting
   that it "find" an Exchange Server computer.
<P>
</OL>The RPC Locator takes the following actions in an effort to find the
requested RPC service (Exchange). The following behavior is for Windows NT
4.x.

<OL><P><LI>The RPC Locator looks in the local RPC Locator cache to see if it has
   already successfully performed this lookup for an Exchange Server
   computer. If it has, The RPC Locator returns the answer from cache.

<P><LI>If the local computer is a Windows NT Workstation in a Windows NT
   domain, the RPC Locator then finds a Windows NT domain controller (DC).
   It looks for a PDC first, and then for backup domain controllers (BDCs).
<P>
   a. If a DC is found, the RPC Locator asks it to find an Exchange Server
<P><PRE>      (consult step 3 to see how a DC finds Exchange Server computer). If
      the DC returns a success, the RPC Locator adds the response to the
      RPC Locator cache. The RPC Locator returns the response from the DC
      (success or failure) to the requesting application (the Exchange
      Server Administrator program).
</PRE><P>
   b. If no DC is found, the RPC Locator issues a local broadcast looking
<P><PRE>      for any Exchange Server computers. If any responses are returned from
      the network, the RPC Locator adds them to the cache and returns the
      answer to the requesting application.
</PRE>
<P><LI>If the local computer is a Windows NT Domain Controller, or a Windows NT
   Workstation in a Workgroup, the RPC Locator issues a local broadcast
   looking for any Exchange Server computers. If any responses are returned
   from the network, the RPC Locator adds them to the cache and returns the
   answer to the Exchange Server Administrator program (or the Windows NT
   Workstation if this request came from a Windows NT Workstation in a
   Windows NT domain).
<P>
</OL>When the Exchange Server Administrator program fails to find any Exchange
Server computers to obtain the Exchange Organization Hierarchy, it is
usually because the PDC is located on a network segment where no Exchange
servers exist. Because the Locator Service uses a broadcast-based discovery
mechanism, routable protocols such at TCP/IP fail to discover Exchange
Server computers unless they are on the same network segment. To ensure
reliable browsing, a default server name should be provided prior to
hitting the browse button, or an Exchange server should be located on the
same network segment as the PDC.
