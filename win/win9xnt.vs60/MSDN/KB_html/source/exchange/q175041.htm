<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
A Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks user with a bullet in his or her
name will be able to send messages to an Exchange Server user through the
AppleTalk connector. However, when an Exchange Server user tries to reply,
he or she gets the following non-delivery report (NDR):
<P>
<PRE>   From: Network Manager
   To:   The Merchant
   Subject: Undeliverable Mail
   Date: 1996-05-02 14:15
   Priority: 3

   Non-delivery explanation:
   Your message did not reach some or all of the intended recipients.
   Date submitted: 1996-05-02 14:15
   Message title: thanks
   The following recipients were valid:

   The following recipient(s) could not be reached:
   | Bullet Before Name@Coconut Mail Server

</PRE>The bullet character is transformed into a vertical bar. This does not
happen when using the Microsoft Connection Gateway to Microsoft Mail for PC
Networks.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The bullet character is not correctly mapped to the Latin 1 character set.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem:

<UL><LI>Do not use the bullet character in the names of Microsoft Mail for
   AppleTalk users.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0.
A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-
tested and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific
problem. Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem,
Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains
this fix. Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
With the fix applied, you can use the bullet character. This character
(option+8) is now mapped to the SPACE character. This means that it is
sorted to the top of the Global Address List. There are still, however,
many other characters that will fail if they are used in the Microsoft Mail
for AppleTalk addresses.
