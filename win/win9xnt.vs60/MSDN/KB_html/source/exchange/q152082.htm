<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you try to modify the contents of a distribution list (DL) that you
own but that was created in a different site than your mailbox, you will
receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Changes to the distribution list membership could not be saved.
   You do not have sufficient permission to perform the operation
   on this object.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This is because you can only see a read-only copy of the DL. For a DL owner
to be able to modify the contents of a DL, the DL must be created in the
same site that the owner's mailbox resides in.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Export the DL using directory export and re-import it into the correct site.  
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If the owner of the DL is to administer the DL, the owner's mailbox must
reside in the same site as the DL.
<P>
The account listed in "Windows NT accounts with permissions" on the 
permissions of the DL must be using a mailbox in the site in order to
administer the DL.  For example, if a user is in another NT Domain but 
their mailbox is in the site where the DL resides, the Administration of 
the DL will be successful.
<P>
Global administration of a Distribution List may be accomplished by making 
a "dummy" mailbox in the site where the Distribution List is located and 
assigning a user, local group or a global group from a trusted domain as 
the " Windows NT accounts with permissions."
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0.
