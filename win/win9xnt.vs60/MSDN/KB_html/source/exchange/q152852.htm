The information in this article applies to:

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The steps below outline the method for moving a user's mailbox and Inbox
Assistant Rules from Site 1 to Site 2.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 

<OL><P><LI>Log on to the mailbox that needs to be moved.

<P><LI>Download all messages to a PST.

<P><LI>Create the mailbox in Site 2.

<P><LI>Log on to the new mailbox in Site 2 and define the moved .PST name
   in the information services for this mailbox.
<P>
   Notes:
<P>
   - Be sure you also move the Schedule+ information to a .SCD file
<P><PRE>     and import it into the new mailbox, if necessary.
</PRE><P>
   - Also, if necessary, remove the old mailbox from Distribution Lists and
<P><PRE>     add the new mailbox to the Distributions Lists.
</PRE>
<P><LI>If the new mailbox name is the same as the old mailbox name, delete the
   old mailbox. If mailbox names will be different, then leave the old
   mailbox in place with an auto forward rule to the new mailbox, and a
   reply to sender telling them to update his or her Personal Address
   Book. After the user has successfully moved and everything is working
   fine in the new location, you can safely delete the old mailbox.
