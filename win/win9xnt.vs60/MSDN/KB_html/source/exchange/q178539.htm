The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5
</UL> 
<P>
IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a
Registry Key" Help topic in Regedt32.exe.
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Exchange Server message transfer agent (MTA) by default will
hold messages based on priority for a set amount of time before sending
them back to the originator as undeliverable.
<P>
These default times include:
<PRE>   Urgent - 2 days
   Normal - 7 Days
   Non-urgent - 10 days

</PRE>A new feature of Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 is the ability to adjust
these parameters.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The default message timeout values for the MTA are effective in most usage
scenarios of Exchange Server; however, there are times when the Exchange
administrator will need to increase the timeout values for slow network
links or server outages or to decrease these values in the case of highly
important and time-sensitive material.
<P>
To adjust these settings, do the following:
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor
can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

<OL><P><LI>Open the Windows NT registry using the REGEDIT utility.

<P><LI>Go to the following key:
<P><PRE>      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services
      \MSExchangeMTA\Parameters
</PRE>
<P><LI>Select Edit.
</OL>4. Select New, and then DWORD Value.

<OL><P><LI>Make a new entry for each one of the following timeout categories:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Message timeout (urgent), minutes
      Message timeout (normal), minutes
      Message timeout (non-urgent), minutes
</PRE><P>
   These must be typed exactly as they appear above. They can be
   individually entered or all used.

<P><LI>After the new key is created, enter the desired timeout as expressed in
   minutes. This can be anything from 1 to 65536.
<P>
   An example would be to set normal messages to time out in 14 days. This
   would be entered as 20160.
<P>
   The maximum timeout value is 45 days.
