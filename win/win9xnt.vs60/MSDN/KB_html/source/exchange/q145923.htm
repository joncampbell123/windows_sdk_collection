The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how to send mail anonymously so that the receiver of
the message does not know who the message came from. This may be useful
when sending messages to a Comments or Feedback mailbox or public folder
where the sender would not like his or her identity revealed but would like
their views noted.
<P>
To avoid misuse of this facility, the administrator can add a delivery
restriction on Distribution Lists as well as individual mailboxes to reject
all messages received from the Anonymous account. The administrator can
also set the permissions on public folders to prevent the Anonymous account
from mailing messages to the public folders.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Using the Exchange Administrator program, create a mailbox with the display
name Anonymous. Give the Windows NT Domain Users group (or any other group
containing all or some of the Exchange users) Send As permissions on this
mailbox.
<P>
To send mail so that it appears to have been sent by the account Anonymous:

<OL><P><LI>Choose Compose and select the New Message command.

<P><LI>From the View menu of this form, select From Box. This should now
   display the From field.

<P><LI>From the address list displayed, select Anonymous.

<P><LI>Select one or more users to send the message to and then send the
   message.

<P><LI>When the message is received, it displays Anonymous as the sender name.
<P>
</OL>To add Send As permission on a mailbox to a Windows NT account from the
Microsoft Exchange Administrator program:

<OL><P><LI> From the Tools menu, select Options.
</OL>2.  Click the Permissions tab.
