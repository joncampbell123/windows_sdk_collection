<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Exchange Client does not warn users about opening potentially
dangerous files and OLE attachments that arrive in e-mail messages.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0.
This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange Server 5.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):
<P>
<PRE>   S E R V P A C K

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following change is planned for Microsoft Exchange Client 5.0 Service
Pack 1. The client behaves like Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.02 when
receiving a file attachment or OLE embedding from an external source. To
effect the change, set attachment security setting to High (on the Tools
menu, click Options, and click the Attachment).
<P>
When you receive a file attachment, you are warned about the dangers of
files from external sources and asked if you want to continue the
operation. For all non-executable/non-scriptable attachment types (that is,
types other than .exe, .cmd, .bat, .zip, and similar types) you are also
presented with the option to not be notified when this type of file is
opened again. You are able to either save the file to another destination
or continue and open this file as is.
<P>
NOTE: No virus scanning is performed on this file. You are responsible for
performing such operations.
<P>
When Windows users receive a URL attachment, the above file attachment
semantics are applied. All Macintosh URLs and other URL types on Windows
are "safe" from the Microsoft Exchange Client perspective because the
Internet agent (browser, WinInet, and so on) is responsible for parsing and
warning you of potential problems.
<P>
When you receive a message containing an embedded OLE object, you are
warned before the message is displayed if it contains potentially harmful
objects, and you are given the choice of removing the object (leaving the
message marked as dirty) or using the object as is. An object is considered
safe to display if it uses only the default OLE server or handler for in-
process operations. You will also be warned about the safety of the OLE
object when you attempt to activate it (for example, when you double-click
or choose another operation from the object's context menu) unless you have
marked all objects as safe. You can also indicate on the warning dialog box
(in either case) whether to be warned about this type of object in the
future.
