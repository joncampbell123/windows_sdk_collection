The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0 and 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Mtacheck.log files are text files that show the results of running the
Mtacheck.exe utility. The MTACHECK utility scans the internal database of
the MTA looking for objects that are damaged and may be interfering with
the queue processing. It places defective objects from the queues in files
for you to examine later. In addition, MTACHECK rebuilds the queues so the
MTA can be restarted and return to processing.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
MTACHECK can be run manually, but is also run automatically when the
Microsoft Exchange Message Transfer Agent service determines that the MTA
was not shut down gracefully. If an automatic MTACHECK is run, events will
be logged to the Application Event Log and an Mtacheck.log file will be
generated in the Mtacheck.out directory off of the Exchsrvr\Mtadata
directory containing the DB*.dat files used by the MTA (If performance
Optimizer has been used to move MTADATA files, there may be more than one
MTADATA directory.)
<P>
If MTACHECK is run manually, no logging is performed unless specified on
the command line. In addition, logs can be created in any location and with
any name. In terms of logging, the automatic MTACHECK is the equivalent of
carrying out the following at the command line (except that an automatic
run also logs events to the event logs):
<P>
<PRE>   MTACHECK /V /F exchsrvr\mtadata\mtacheck.out\mtacheck.log

</PRE><h3>INTERPRETING MTACHECK OUTPUT</h3>
 
<P>
MTACHECK examines each queue in the database. If it finds an error, it
reports the name of the queue, the type of error, and the number of
messages returned to the rebuilt queue. For example:
<P>
<PRE>   Queue 'xxxxxxx' required reconstruction
    - corrupted queue file
   23 messages recovered to the queue

</PRE>MTACHECK then examines objects in the queues. If an object is in error, it
removes the it from the queue and places it in a file in
Exchsrvr\Mtadata\Mtacheck.out. It reports the object ID, error type, queue
name, and the MTS-ID of the corrupted message, if known.
<P>
An MTS-ID is assigned to each message by its transport service and remains
with the message to its destination, although gateways may assign
additional identifiers. It consists of the originating server, the date and
time the message was sent, and a unique hexadecimal identifier for the
message. A sample MTACHECK log can include:
<P>
<PRE>   Object 300596 invalid
    - missing object file
   Object removed from queue 'xxxxxxx'
   MTS-ID: c=US;a= ;p=Owen;l=Washington0196012020010800000CDE

</PRE>When the MTA finishes processing, it displays one of following messages to
describe the results:
<P>
<PRE>   Database clean, no errors detected

   Database repaired, some data may have been lost

    -  &lt;number&gt; queue(s) required repair out of &lt;percent&gt; detected
    -  &lt;number&gt; object(s) damaged out of &lt;percent&gt; detected

   Database has serious errors and cannot be reconstructed.

   Some objects missing from the Boot Environment. Please reload the
   files from the BOOTENV directory on the install CD.

</PRE>The boot environment message indicates that report templates and other
objects the MTA needs are missing and the MTA cannot generate them. These
objects are included in the files in the Bootenv folder. Once you have
installed them, rerun MTACHECK. When the process is complete, restart the
MTA.
<P>
WARNING: Copy only objects that are missing to the boot environment. If you
replace existing objects, all messages in MTA queues will be deleted.
<P>
<P><h3>SEARCHING MESSAGE LOGS BY MESSAGE ID</h3>
 
<P>
MTACHECK also reports the message ID of removed objects in its log if they
can be determined. If message tracking is enabled, you can search the
tracking log for the object by its message ID. Determining the path of the
bad message can lead you to the cause of the problem. You may need to
search the logs of more than one site to find the complete path of the
message.
