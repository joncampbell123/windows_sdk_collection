The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Exchange Windows 95 client, version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Forms installed in the Organization (ORG) Forms Library are not viewable
except by the user who created and installed them. The form library is
viewable, but the forms themselves are not. Forms that have been installed
in public folders, the personal forms library, or PST files are still
available.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The correct permissions are not set on the ORG Forms Library system folder
in the Microsoft Exchange organization.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Set the default permissions on the ORG forms library to (at least)
reviewer.

<OL><P><LI>In the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program, open the
   following system folder:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Folders/System Folders/EFORMS Registry/Organization forms folder.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Press ALT+ENTER to see the properties of that folder.

<P><LI>Click the Client Permissions button.

<P><LI>In the Permissions dialog box, change the default rights to at
   least reviewer (which will give users the ability to read items).

<P><LI>Click OK and close the ORG Forms Library properties.

<P><LI>Quit the Microsoft Exchange Client and restart the client.
<P>
</OL>The users should now be able to see the forms in the ORG forms library
and also be able to install and run them.
