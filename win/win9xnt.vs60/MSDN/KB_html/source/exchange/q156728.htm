The information in this article applies to:
- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0
 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you send messages from Microsoft Mail by means of the Microsoft Exchange
MS Mail Connector Interchange (MSMI), thus using Microsoft Exchange to
address recipients in foreign X.400 systems, you may receive non-delivery
reports (NDRs). These NDRs may be followed by a read receipt (RR) or a
reply that obviously shows that the message was delivered to the intended
recipient.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Various X.400 Message Transfer Agents (MTAs) can be configured to send out
Delivery Reports (DRs) for every incoming message. Because MSMI does not
differentiate between DRs and NDRs, an NDR will be returned to you.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange
Service Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The above described configuration on foreign MTAs might be necessary for
User Agents (UAs) residing on various Legacy Systems. Such UAs might not be
able to handle the PerRecipientFlag as defined in the X.400 standards. UAs
receiving messages that contain a PerRecipientFlag, indicating that a Read
Receipt was requested by the originating sender, would not be able to
fulfill this request. As a common and valid workaround, some MTAs can be
configured to reply to every incoming message destined for local delivery
with a DR. These DRs do not contain a P2/P22 content. This missing content
is the reason that MSMI mistakenly renders DRs as NDRs.
