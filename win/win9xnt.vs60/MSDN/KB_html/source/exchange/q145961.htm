<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When accessing a mailbox folder which you have full owner permissions,
you may get the following error message if you do not have proper access
permissions:
<P>
When using Microsoft Exchange version 4.0 clients -
<P>
<PRE>   The Folder could not be opened. You do not have sufficient
   permission to perform this operation on this object. See the folder
   contact or your system administrator.

</PRE>When using Microsoft Exchange version 5.0 clients -
<P>
<PRE>   The folder could not be opened.  The client operation failed.

</PRE>NOTE: The properties for this mailbox will show that you are the owner of
the mailbox.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This is by design. The Microsoft Exchange Permission User Interface (UI),
used by private and public Exchange stores, does not allow you to set
recursive permissions on folders.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
You must set each folders permission individually.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
New sub-folders will inherit the properties of their parent folder when
they are created; however, the permissions of the existing sub-folders will
not be modified.
<P>
If you are given permissions to a folder, and a sub-folder is created, you
will have the same permissions to the sub-folder that you have to the
parent folder. If you are given permissions to the parent folder after the
sub-folder is created, you will not have permissions to the sub-folder.
