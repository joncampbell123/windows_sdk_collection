The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0 and 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When an X.400 message sent from Microsoft Exchange Server to a foreign MTA
cannot be delivered by the foreign MTA, a non-delivery report (NDR) is sent
back to Microsoft Exchange Server. This NDR contains the original message
as content.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The PerMessageFlag of an X.400 message sent by the Microsoft Exchange MTA
is always constructed with the ContentReturnRequest field being set to
true. As a result, any NDR contains the content of the original message.
The construction of the ContentReturnRequest field cannot be configured
through the Microsoft Exchange administration module or through the client
software.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0.
A supported fix to this problem is in development, but has not been fully
regression-tested and should be applied only to systems experiencing this
specific problem. Unless you are severely impacted by this specific
problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that
contains this fix. Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information
on the availability of this fix.
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0.
This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange 5.0 Server U.S.
Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The behavior described in this article does not represent a violation of
any X.400 standard. However on low-bandwidth or expensive X.400 links, it
may not be desirable for the NDR to contain the original message as
content. The fix described herein allows you to configure the
ContentReturnRequest field on a per-connector basis. The default behavior
for Microsoft Exchange Server is to set the ContentReturnRequest field to
true, thus asking for the content to be sent back with an NDR.
<P>
You can set the ContentReturnRequest field to false in order to not request
the content be returned with an NDR. Please do the following, after
applying the hotfix, for EACH X.400 connector for which you want the
Microsoft Exchange default setting to be changed:

<OL><P><LI>Start the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program in raw mode
   using the following syntax:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ADMIN -R
</PRE>
<P><LI>In the Connections container, select the X.400 connector you want to
   change.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Raw Properties. This brings up the raw
   property page of the selected connector.

<P><LI>In the "List attributes of type" box at the lower left corner of the
   Raw Properties tab page, click Non existing.

<P><LI>In the "Object attributes" list box, select the Heuristics property to
   highlight it.

<P><LI>In the "Edit value" box, type 64 (0x40 hex); the Set button will become
   active. Click the Set button.

<P><LI>Click the Apply button and then click the OK button. This should close
   the Raw Properties page for this connector.

<P><LI>Check to see whether your modifications have been applied properly:
<P>
   a. On the File menu, click Raw Properties again.
<P>
   b. In the "List attributes of type" box, click Existing objects. You
<P><PRE>      should see the Heuristics property with a value of 64.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Repeat steps 1 through 9 for each connector you want to modify. If you
</OL>want the modifications to take effect immediately, stop and restart
the service Microsoft Exchange message transfer agent (MTA).
