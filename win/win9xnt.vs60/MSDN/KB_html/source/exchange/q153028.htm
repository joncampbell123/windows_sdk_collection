<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you export the directory, only the primary addresses are exported by
default. In order to export all addresses, including the secondary
addresses, the export file (.CSV) should have Secondary-Proxy- Addresses as
part of the header.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Exchange Server automatically generates the following e-mail
addresses for the server core components and recipients: MS Mail (PC)
address, X.400 address, and SMTP address. These addresses are the primary
addresses and are identified by bold, capitalized text in the E-mail
Addresses page.
<P>
If needed, you can use the E-mail Addresses property page to add multiple
addresses. These addresses are the secondary addresses and are identified
by regular, lower case text. You can "promote" the secondary address to the
primary address by selecting the address and pressing Set as Reply Address
button in the E-mail Addresses property page.
<P>
To export only the primary addresses, you can use the Admin program and
either click Directory Export on the Tools menu in the user-interface or
run the program from the command. In order to include the secondary
addresses in the exported text output (.CSV file), make sure that the
export file (CSV file) that is specified when you export the directory
contains the Secondary-Proxy-Addresses in the header.
<P>
Complete the following steps to export the multiple addresses:

<OL><P><LI>From the Admin program user-interface, click Directory Export on
   the Tools menu.

<P><LI>Select the Export File button to specify the text output file.

<P><LI>Select the Export button to export the directory.

<P><LI>If the export file specified in step #2 did not exist or did not
   contain the Secondary-Proxy-Addresses as part of the header, only the
   primary addresses would have shown in the exported text output.

<P><LI>Open the exported text output with any text editor.

<P><LI>Go to the end of the first line and add the following:
<P>
   , Secondary-Proxy-Addresses

<P><LI>Save and close the file.

<P><LI>Export the directory again. Make sure to specify the edited file as
   the export file. As a result, the exported text output has all e-mail
   addresses---the primary and the secondary addresses.
