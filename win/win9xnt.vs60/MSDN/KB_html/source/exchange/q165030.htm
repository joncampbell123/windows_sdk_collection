SUMMARY
======= 
<P>
The following information should allow you to make a 1988 connection between 
Microsoft Exchange Server and Mailbus 400 using TCP/IP as the transport 
mechanism. It is recommend that you do this in the order specified, but it 
is not required. The information below covers the trouble spots and the 
parameters which must be set in a non-intuitive or non-default way. 
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor
can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.
<P>
The system in this examples uses the following configuration:
<P>
<PRE>   IP Address: 204.5.25.76   
   Hostname: IGPAA2.IGA.COM  
   TSAP MTA88-DECUS1 MTA88-DECUS1 
   SSAP MTA MTA 
   PSAP MTA MTA 

</PRE>To make a 1988 connection between the MailBus 400 system and Exchange Server,
follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the MailBus 400 system, define your Message Transfer Agent (MTA) and
   note your MTA presentation address. 
<P>
   NCL&gt;SHO MTA PRESENTATION ADDR Node 0 MTA at 1996-05-06-15:16:52.751+00:00Iinf 
   Characteristics Presentation Address="""MTA""/""MTA""/""MTA88-IGPAA2""/RFC1006+
   IGPAA2.IGA.COM,RFC1006" 

<P><LI>Similarly, define the PEER MTA (in other words, the Exchange Server) to
   MailBus 400, and make note of the presentation address. At the end of this
   article is attached the NCL script we are using to define our Exchange Server
   computer (called DECUS1). 
<P>
   NCL&gt;SHO MTA PEER MTA [TYPE=MANUALLY CONFIGURED,NAME="nnnn"] 
   PRES ADDR Node 0 MTA Peer MTA [ Type = Manually Configured , Name = "nnnn" ] at
   1996-05-06-15:27:04.798+00:00Iinf 
   Characteristics Presentation Address = """MTA""/""MTA""/""MTA88-DECUS1""
   /RFC1006+204.5.25.76,RFC1006" 

<P><LI>Now we will use those presentation addresses to tell Exchange how to talk to 
   MailBus 400. Create the TCP transport stack definition or if it already exists, click
   on it (under Server in the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program) to modify 
   it. The OSI address information must look like this: 
<P>
<P><PRE>      T selector:MTA88-DECUS1 
      S selector:MTA 
      P selector:MTA 
</PRE>   
   Get these values from step 2 above - the presentation address of the PEER in
   MailBus 400. They are case sensitive so use upper case for everything. 

<P><LI>Create your X.400 connector, or if it already exists, modify it. On the STACK
   tab of the X.400 connector, you must set the fields as follows:
<P>
<P><PRE>      IP address: 1.2.3.4 (put in the address of the MB400 machine) 
      Outgoing OSI address information 
<PRE></PRE>         T selector:MTA88-IGPAA2 
         S selector:MTA 
         P selector:MTA 
      Incoming OSI address information 
         T selector:MTA88-IGPAA2 
         S selector:MTA 
         P selector:MTA 
      Use expedited data: Yes

    Both sets of selectors are identical, this is crucial. You got these values
    from step 1 above. 

</PRE><P><LI>Click on the X.400 connector's ADVANCED tab and verify the following settings: 
<P>
<P><PRE>      MTA conformance: 1988 normal mode 
      X.400 link options Allow BP-15 [in addition to BP-14]: Allow MS-Exchange
      contents: Two way alternate.
</PRE>
<P><LI>After you've saved all of the X.400 connector changes, start the Windows NT
   Registry Editor and go to:
<P>
<P><PRE>      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeMTA\Parameters 
</PRE><P>
   Find the Supports 2K TPDU parameter, double-click it, and set it to 1. 

<P><LI>Check your Local/Remote passwords. Specify the MTA name/password on the 
   Exchange MTA\General Tab. 

<P><LI>Make sure the X400 address is configured correctly. 

<P><LI>Restart the Exchange MTA for the parameter change to take effect. 
<P>
</OL>The 1988 connection should now be made.
<PRE> 
</PRE></OL>Administrator of the DECMAILBUS 400 should know how to configure the NCL Script. 
Refer the mailbus documentation for more information.
