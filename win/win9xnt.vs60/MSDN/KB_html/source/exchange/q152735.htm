The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Windows 95 client, versions 4.0 and 5.0

<LI>Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0 and 5.0

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When run the Microsoft Exchange client with an Offline folder
configured, you may receive the following error messages:
<P>
<PRE>   The file Path:\exchange.ost is in use and could not be accessed.
   Close any application that is using this file, and then try again.

   The set of folders could not be opened. The file Path:\exchange.ost
   is in use and could not be accessed. Close any application that is
   using this file, and then try again."

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Check to see if the Offline folder is currently being used by another
Microsoft Exchange user or if the file has been locked open. Use the
Control Panel Server applet to verify that the file is not locked open.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Offline folder (Path:\exchange.ost) can only be accessed by one
Microsoft Exchange user at a time. If multiple Microsoft Exchange users try
to access the Offline folder, only the first user will be allowed access to
the file and the additional Microsoft Exchange users will be refused
access.
