The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
A message is returned to sender with a Non-Delivery Report (NDR) after only
one attempt at sending from one MTA to another MTA using an X.400
connector. When the MTA on the other side is down, the message is expected
to sit in the queue and to be retried based on the settings under
Connection Retry Values on the Override tab on the X.400 connector property
pages.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The problem occurs for messages sent to address spaces that have only one
possible route, but for which the connector used can be involved in
multiple routes for other address spaces. A quick test, (that is, "Does the
connector have any alternate routes?") is initially used to decide whether
or not to reroute a message. The full reroute processing for a message then
uses the actual address space of the message to determine if an alternate
route is available. (A connector may be the only route for address space X,
but may be one of many possible routes for address space Y).
<P>
During reroute processing of a message with just one possible route, the
route history is kept incorrectly. The second time the message goes through
through reroute
processing it behaves as though :

<UL><LI>this message has just been transferred in.

<LI>the message has already traversed the destination MTA.
<P>
</UL>The "Routing loop prevention" function then prevents the message from being
routed to the destination MTA; no other routes are available and so the
message is returned with an NDR.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange
Service Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
