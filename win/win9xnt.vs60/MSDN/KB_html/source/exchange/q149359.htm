<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Exchange administrators have the ability to set Delivery
Restrictions on individual mailboxes so that mail can be rejected or
accepted based on who the sender of the message is. If you use the
Microsoft Exchange Administrator's program to specify a Distribution List
(DL) in the Reject Messages From listbox on the Delivery Restrictions tab
of a Mailbox's properties page, you should expect the following behavior
(where user is a member of the DL specified):

<OL><P><LI>Any messages sent to the DL by members or non-members will be received
   by the user.

<P><LI>All members of this DL will be unable to send explicitly to the user. An
   important repercussion here is that the user will not be able to send
   mail to themselves because they are a member of the DL that has been
   restricted. The sender will receive the following Non-Delivery Report
   (NDR) generated by the MSExchangeMTA:
<P>
<P><PRE>      A restriction in the system prevented delivery of the message.
</PRE><P>
</OL>In summary, the Reject Messages From option is not designed to prohibit
delivery of messages sent to a DL. It is designed to Reject Messages From
senders who are members of the DL.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If you want to stop delivery of incoming mail sent to a particular DL, use
the Inbox Assistant. For more information about the Inbox Assistant, please
refer to Online Help in the Microsoft Exchange client.
