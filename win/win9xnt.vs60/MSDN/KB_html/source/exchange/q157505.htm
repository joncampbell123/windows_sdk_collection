with third-party products or configurations that have not been tested and
are not supported by Microsoft.

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article is reprint of a market bulletin prepared by the Microsoft
Exchange Server Product Management Team, July 1996.
<P>
Microsoft Exchange UNIX Client Platform Support:
<P>
<P><h3>UNIX as a Client Platform</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft is committed to providing access to Microsoft Exchange services
from the widest possible array of client desktops. Research shows that the
following are the top three requirements of customers that have UNIX as a
client platform:  Schedule+ support, performance equivalent to a 486 Intel
computer without interrupting background processing, and product
availability shortly after the release of Microsoft Exchange Server.
<P>
Microsoft determined that current efforts to develop a native UNIX client
would fall short of these expectations. A "port" of the Microsoft Exchange
client would take at least six months, and would only deliver functionality
on par with the MS-DOS client.  Microsoft also ruled out current emulation
technologies as being unable to deliver the necessary performance.
Emulation solutions also typically kill background procession and
terminals. Microsoft, therefore, began to pursue other technologies that
proved to be more promising.
<P>
<P><h3>Solutions Available</h3>
 
<P>
To provide a solution in the appropriate time frame, Microsoft looked
outside the company. Microsoft found a number of third-party vendors
developing a technology which, in essence, brings the X-Windows technology
to Windows NT Server. These products allow 32bit Windows applications to
run on a Windows NT Server, while passing the graphic output and user
inputs (the User Interface) to the UNIX workstation running X-Windows. This
technology meets the customer requirements, in that it supports the full 32-
bit Microsoft Exchange client, including Schedule+7.0 and E-Forms Designer,
it performs equivalent to a 486/66 or better processor, and is currently
available.
<P>
This technology has the additional advantage of supporting not only the
Microsoft Exchange client, but other Windows applications as well. For
example, a company can potentially roll out Microsoft Office applications
to their UNIX clients, facilitating the transfer of documents and
information between users. A disadvantage to this solution, of course, is
that customers would need to purchase this technology in addition to their
Microsoft Exchange Server client access licenses (CALs).
<P>
<P><h3>Solutions In Progress</h3>
 
<P>
Moving forward, Microsoft will deliver a number of Microsoft Exchange
technologies this year designed to better integrate Microsoft Exchange with
the Internet, and consequently, better support UNIX-based clients. These
technologies are expected to go into Beta in the third quarter of 1996,
with feature update releases at six month intervals.
<P>
The first technology is Exchange Server POP3 support. This will allow
existing Internet mail clients that support the POP3 protocols access to
the basic messaging features of Microsoft Exchange Server. This technology
is limited by its protocols, and does not support forms. Consequently, it
does not support access to Schedule+ information either.
<P>
The second technology, the Microsoft Exchange Web Access Service (formerly
known as the Microsoft Exchange Web Connector), is less limited by existing
standards and has the potential to evolve rapidly. Available in 1997, the
Web Access Service will allow native HTTP access to Microsoft Exchange
Public Folders, authenticated access to personal mailboxes, and support for
HTML queries to the Microsoft Exchange Global Address Book. It will also
provide support for forms and Schedule+ viewing.
<P>
Microsoft is delivering on its commitment to provide support for those
customers who wish to access Microsoft Exchange Server from their UNIX
workstations. For those customers who need a solution today, and who need
the rich functionality of the full 32-bit Microsoft Exchange Client, with
support for Group Scheduling and Forms, Microsoft recommends third-party
solutions, including those listed above, which are available today. Moving
forward, Microsoft Exchange Server will be able to act as a POP3 server,
making it possible to have POP3 clients connect directly to Microsoft
Exchange Server.
