The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
You may have difficulty delivering messages with the Microsoft Exchange
Message Transfer Agent (MTA). The symptoms for this problem are as follows:

<UL><LI>The Directory service (DS) is consistently very busy (processor usage is
   20 percent or greater).

<LI>MTA processor usage is quite low.

<LI>The MTA WorkQueue consistently has a backlog of messages.

<LI>Messages are not being delivered to the server.

<LI>The GAL is very large (20,000 users or more).
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem is caused by time-consuming fuzzy proxy Directory service (DS)
searches on large Global Address Lists (GALs).
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Apply the fix referenced below. If this does not correct the problem, do
one of the following:

<UL><LI>Create the registry entry "Allow fuzzy proxy search" and set it to 0:
<P>
</UL>WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall Windows NT. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved.
Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

<OL><P><LI>Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

<P><LI>Under the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following subkey:
<P>
<P><PRE>      SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeMTA\Parameters
</PRE>
<P><LI>The registry value that needs to be defined is as follows:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Allow fuzzy proxy search
</PRE><P>
   Set this value to 0. This case-sensitive registry value is a DWORD.
   Setting "Allow fuzzy proxy search"=0 disables the fuzzy proxy search. If
   this Registry value does not exist in the registry, the MTA will assume
   a value of 1 for this setting and thus fuzzy proxy searches are enabled.

<P><LI>Quit Registry Editor.
<P>
</OL>-or-
<P>
If the problem still persists, disable the alternate recipient "Redirect
and Deliver" option for every mailbox on the server. To do this:

<UL><LI>Click the "Delivery Options" tab on each  mailbox and set the Alternate
   Recipient option to "None."
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server,
version 4.0.
This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange 4.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):
<P>
<PRE>   S E R V P A C K

</PRE></OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior can occur when the MTA attempts to deliver a message
addressed to an X.400 proxy that does not exactly match an address in the
GAL, and when the proxy contains a substring similar to other addresses in
the GAL. For example, message delivery may be slow if a message is
addressed to an X.400 proxy similar to the following:
<P>
<PRE>   X400:C=US;A= ;P=Microsoft;CN=PaulBon

</PRE>This address does not fully match the defined X.400 address for that
mailbox and when there are thousands of other X.400 proxies in the GAL that
contain the substring
<P>
<PRE>   X400:C=US;A= ;P=Microsoft

</PRE>the MTA makes a request for the DS to resolve the address. If the DS is
unable to resolve the full address via an exact match, the DS will attempt
to perform a fuzzy proxy search based on the parsed substrings.
<P>
By default, the MTA attempts to perform a fuzzy proxy search if it is
unable to match the O/R address when performing a DS_Search. The fuzzy
proxy search can be disabled by adding the registry value "Allow fuzzy
proxy search" and setting it to 0.
