The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Windows 95 client, versions 4.0 and 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0 and 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0 and 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Exchange Macintosh client, versions 4.0 and 5.0
</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you start the Microsoft Exchange client with a new profile in offline
mode for the first time, the following error message appears:
<P>
<PRE>   The set of folders could not be opened. You must connect to your
   Microsoft Exchange Server computer with the current profile before you
   can synchronize your folders with your offline folder file.

</PRE>When you click OK, the Microsoft Exchange client opens, but any attempt to
access your mailbox results in the same error message.
<P>
The offline folder file (.OST) must be fully synchronized with the computer
running Microsoft Exchange Server in online mode before it can be used
offline.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This occurs when you use the Inbox Setup Wizard to create a profile and
answer Yes to the Microsoft Exchange Server service question "Do you travel
with this computer?" The result is that a default offline folder file is
created in the system directory (that is, C:\WINDOWS\ EXCHANGE.OST for
Windows or SYSTEM FOLDER, PREFERENCES, EXCHANGE PROFILES, OFFLINE FOLDERS
for Macintosh operating systems) and the option "Choose the connection type
when starting" is selected.
<P>
When you start the Microsoft Exchange client using this profile, you are
presented with the choice to connect or work offline. If you choose to work
offline, and you have not yet synchronized the .OST file, the error message
appears.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this problem:

<OL><P><LI>Start the Microsoft Exchange client using this profile and connect in
   online mode to the computer running Microsoft Exchange Server by one of
   the following methods:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - For both Windows and Macintosh users: Use the client on a computer
      that is connected to the computer running Microsoft Exchange Server
      by a LAN.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    -OR-
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - For Windows users only: Establish a dial-up connection to the
      computer running Microsoft Exchange Server prior to starting the
      Microsoft Exchange client.
</PRE>
<P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Synchronize and click All Folders. Allow the
   synchronization of all folders to complete before proceding.

<P><LI>Exit and log off and restart the Microsoft Exchange client in offline
   mode.
<P></OL>
