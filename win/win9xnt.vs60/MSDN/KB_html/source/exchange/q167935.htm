The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0 and 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it
if a problem occurs. For information on how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" online Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry
Key" online Help topic in Regedt32.exe.
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Under certain conditions, the Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client may
allow you to gain access to your mailbox even though you enter incorrect
Windows NT credentials (user name, domain name, or password). This problem
occurs when the Use Network Security During Logon option is disabled for
your profile. Normally, when this option is disabled, you have to enter the
correct Windows NT credentials before being given access to your mailbox.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The behavior described above will only occur if all of the following
conditions are met:

<UL><LI>You physically log on to the Windows NT domain at the Exchange Server
   computer where your mailbox resides.

<LI>The account with which you log on to the domain is the Primary Windows
   NT account of the mailbox being accessed.

<LI>The ncalrpc protocol, which refers to the Local RPC protocol, is listed
   in the RPC_Binding_Order value of the following Registry key:
<P>
<P><PRE>      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Exchange\Exchange Provider
</PRE>
<LI>The Exchange Windows client uses Local RPC communication to resolve the
   connection to the Exchange Server computer.
<P>
</UL>For example, you log on to the Exchange Server computer and create a
profile with the Use Network Security During Logon option disabled. When
attempting to log on to your mailbox, you are prompted to enter the
appropriate Windows NT credentials. Even if you enter the wrong user name,
domain name, or password, you will still be connected to your mailbox. This
is because, like the Named Pipes protocol, Local RPC caches your logon
credentials. These credentials override any credentials entered manually by
you. This behavior is by design.
<P>
It is important to note that users will not be able to access another
user's mailbox. If an attempt is made to do so with invalid Windows NT
credentials, the user will be denied access to the mailbox, as expected.
Also, local RPC communication is only used when Exchange Client is running
on the same computer as the RPC target (in this case the server).
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall Windows. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be
solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and
Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" online Help
topics in Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before
you edit it.
<P>
To resolve this problem, modify the registry in one of the following ways:

<UL><LI>Remove ncalrpc from the RPC_Binding_Order registry value.
<P>
   -OR-

<LI>Change the order in which ncalrpc appears in the RPC binding order. For
   example, make TCP/IP the first protocol and then local RPC. This entry
   would appear as follows:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ncacn_ip_tcp,ncalrpc,ncacn_spx,ncacn_np,netbios,ncacn_vns_spp
