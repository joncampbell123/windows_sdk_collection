<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you attempt to import bulletin board information from Lotus cc:Mail 
to Microsoft Exchange Server, several error messages may be displayed and 
a public folder may not be created, indicating that the import did not 
finish successfully. If you view the application log, the following 
events appear:
<P>
<PRE>   Source: MS Exchange Migration
   Event: 98
   Description: Parser Error on line &lt;x&gt;. An error occurred in processing 
   of line #&lt;x&gt;.

   Source: MS Exchange Migration
   Event: 122
   Description: Parser Error on line &lt;x&gt;. Failure to open/create public 
   Folder.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem can occur when the service account does not have permission 
to create a top-level folder.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click Start, point to Programs, point to Microsoft Exchange, and 
   then click Microsoft Exchange Administrator.

<P><LI>Click Configuration in the left pane, click Information Store Site 
   Configuration in the right pane, and then click Properties on the File 
   menu. Note that you may need to expand the server's branch in the left 
   pane by double-clicking the branch, or by clicking the plus sign (+) 
   to the left of the branch, before you can click Configuration.

<P><LI>Click the Top Level Folder Creation tab. If a list of names appears in 
   the Allowed To Create Top Level Folders box, delete the names and then 
   select All.

<P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
There is no mailbox associated with the service account. Therefore, if 
you specify a list of names in the Allowed To Create Top Level Folders 
box instead of selecting All, you are unable to include the service 
account in the list and the service account is unable to create top-level 
folders. 
<P>
When you import bulletin board information from Lotus cc:Mail, Microsoft 
Exchange Server creates a new public folder called Lotus cc:Mail Bulletin 
Boards (&lt;server&gt;), where &lt;server&gt; is the name of the server from which 
you are importing. The contents of the bulletin board are copied to this 
folder. If you import multiple bulletin boards, additional folders for 
each bulletin board are created below this folder.
<P>
cc:Mail is manufactured by Lotus, a vendor independent of Microsoft; we 
make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's 
performance or reliability.
