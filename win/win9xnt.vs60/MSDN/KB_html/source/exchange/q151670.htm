The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Exchange Resource Kit contains a program, Sendmail.exe, which
is a 32-bit command line utility to send mail messages and file
attachments. This program is also available in the Microsoft Mail Resource
Kit.
<P>
Microsoft Exchange Administrators may need to run this program
automatically, using the AT Scheduler in Windows NT or the Winat.exe
program, that ships in the Windows NT Resource Kit.
<P>
This article explains how to send mail using Sendmail.exe and the AT
scheduler.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Programs scheduled with the Windows NT AT scheduler are run by the Windows
NT Schedule service. In order to send mail to an Exchange mailbox, using
the SENDMAIL.EXE program, the Schedule service must start using a domain
account. By default the service will start using the LocalSystem account.
<P>
The steps below explain how to use the Sendmail.exe program with the AT
scheduler.

<OL><P><LI>Log on to Windows NT with a domain account, for example DOMAIN\USER.

<P><LI>From the Windows NT Control Panel, run the Services tool.

<P><LI>Select the Schedule service and press the Startup button.

<P><LI>In the "Log On As" section, click on This Account and then
    click on the ellipsis to bring up the list of domain users. Select
    DOMAIN\USER.

<P><LI>Enter the password for DOMAIN\USER in the Password and Confirm
    Password fields.

<P><LI>In the Startup Type section, select Automatic. This will cause
    the service to automatically start when the computer is started.

<P><LI>Click OK and close the Services dialog box.

<P><LI>From the Windows NT Control Panel, run the Mail and Fax tool.

<P><LI>Create a profile with the name SENDMAIL. Add the Exchange Server
    service to the profile.

<P><LI>Make sure that the Windows NT account DOMAIN\USER that was specified to
    start the Schedule service has permissions to open the Exchange mailbox
    specified in the profile. Go into Exchange Administrator program and
    give the mailbox (the one pointed to by the profile in step 10) the
    Send As permission (or the Mailbox Owner permission) on the
    permissions page of the mailbox's properties. Make sure to select the
    correct options in the Tools, Options/Permissions page so that the
    Permissions page is displayed for each the mailbox object along with
    the user rights.

<P><LI>The following command can then be used with the AT scheduler or the
    Winat.exe program:
<P>
       SENDMAIL.EXE -u &lt;profile name&gt; -p password -r &lt;recipients&gt; -s
       &lt;subject&gt;
<P>
    The &lt;profile name&gt; is the name of the profile we created in step 10,
    Sendmail. SENDMAIL.EXE requires a password. The password specified with
    the -p option is only to prevent SENDMAIL.EXE from failing. It is not
    used.
<P>
</OL>Please refer to the documentation accompanying the SENDMAIL.EXE for more
information on all the command line switches available.
<P>
NOTE:In order for the AT scheduler to be able to successfully run the
Sendmail.exe program, you must be logged on to Windows NT as a DOMAIN\USER.
This User must be the account used to start the Schedule service and must
have access to the mailbox that Sendmail.exe will log on to.
