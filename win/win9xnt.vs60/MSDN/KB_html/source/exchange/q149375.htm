SUMMARY
 
<P>
The Personal Forms Library is one of the containers available to Microsoft
Exchange users to house Electronic Forms Designer forms. The Personal Forms
Library is maintained by the default mailbox the user has configured in
their profile (this can be determined by selecting Tools, Options,
Delivery, from the Microsoft Exchange client).
<P>
Therefore, if the default Inbox is in a Personal Information Store (PST),
the forms are maintained in the PST. Since PST's are local to the computer,
the forms available in the Personal Forms Library will also be local to
that computer.
<P>
If the default Inbox is on a Microsoft Exchange Server (the default
location), the Personal Forms Library will be located and maintained on
that Microsoft Exchange Server in the Microsoft Exchange database file
Priv.edb. If local replication is being used, the Personal Forms Library
will also be available locally. This will allow the forms that are only
available in the Personal Forms Library to be available offline.
<P>
However, in the above case the Inbox and the Personal Forms Library are
still two distinct stores. If you install or copy a form to your Inbox, it
will not appear in the Personal Forms Library.
