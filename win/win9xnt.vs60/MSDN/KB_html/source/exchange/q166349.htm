<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The following article lists all versions of Microsoft Exchange Server and 
Client software that have been released to date and how to determine which 
version(s) are currently running.  
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Determining Exchange Server Versions</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program.
</OL>2. Select the Exchange Server in the left-hand pane.
3. Click Properties on the File menu. 
<P>
The version, build number, and any service packs that are installed should be 
displayed. 
<P>
NOTE: Selecting help/about from within the Administrator program gives the 
version of Admin.exe and may be misleading if you are running the 
Administrator program against a different Exchange Server or from a Windows 
NT Workstation.  
<P>
<P><h3>Determining Exchange Client Versions</h3>
 
<P>
Select help/about from within the Microsoft Exchange Client.
<P>
NOTE: From Windows 95 or Windows NT, you may be able to determine which 
version is installed by selecting properties for a particular file from 
Windows (NT) Explorer and selecting Version.  
<P>
Microsoft Exchange Service packs are posted at the following address:

</PRE></OL>Here is a list of past and current Microsoft Exchange versions numbers and their 
associated releases: 
<P>
Here is a list of Exchange versions numbers and their associated Build numbers:
<P>
<PRE>   Version                 Build Number
   ------------------------------------
   4.0 RTM                      837
   4.0 SP1                      838
   4.0 SP2 (Exchange 4.0a)      993
   4.0 SP3                      994
   4.0 SP4                      995
   5.0 RTM                     1457
   5.0 SP1                     1458
   5.5 RTM                   8.03.4629 (due to the switch to the Outlook Client)


</PRE>The Windows Messaging Client that ships with Windows NT version 4.0 also has a 
build number of 837, the same as Exchange 4.0. The splash screen, however, is 
entitled Windows Messaging, not Microsoft Exchange. The Windows Messaging 
client that ships with Windows 95 is build 950. Neither of these clients 
provide connectivity to an Exchange Server and must be upgraded to one of the 
versions listed in the table above to work with Exchange Server.
<P>
<P><h2>Additional Information about Service Packs</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft releases service packs for Microsoft Exchange on a regular basis. 
Microsoft recommends running the latest service packs on all servers and clients 
whenever possible, but it is not required that all Exchange Servers or Clients be 
simultaneously upgraded to the same service packs (although this may be ideal). 
<P>
In general, Microsoft Exchange Service Packs are cumulative, that is each service 
pack contains all fixes up to that point. This means that in order to bring a Server
(or Client) up to a SP level, the earlier SP doesn't have to first be installed. The 
exceptions to this rule are Exchange 4.0 Service Packs greater than SP2. Due to the 
size of Exchange SP2, subsequent SPs were created as deltas only. To bring a Client 
or Exchange Server up to a later 4.0 SP, SP2 needs to be first applied.  
<P>
As with any major Software rollout, Microsoft recommends installing service packs 
on a non-production (test) computer first and testing similar functions to those 
that your production Server/client encounter. Always read the release notes (usually 
<PRE>Readme.wri) prior to installing the Service Pack into production.
