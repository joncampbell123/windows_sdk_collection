<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you attempt to administer the MS Mail Connector or Internet Mail
Connector that is located on a Windows NT 4.0 Server computer with an
account that is not a Windows NT Administrator account, the following
error message will appear:
<P>
<PRE>   The MSMAIL Connector Registry Key
   System\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeMSMI\Parameters\Admin
   could not be opened because the Registry Security is not set up
   correctly.

</PRE>Followed by this error message:
<P>
<PRE>   You will not be able to view all the property sheets because the MS Mail
   Connector could not initialize completely.

</PRE>If you are administering the Internet Mail Connector in Microsoft Exchange
Server version 4.0, you will see the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   The data to be configured could not be loaded.

</PRE>If you are administering the Internet Mail Connector in Microsoft Exchange
Server version 5.0, you will see this error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Extension "SMTP" could not be loaded. A problem occurred with the
   extension .DLL file, possibly due to memory shortage.  Close some
   applications or windows, and try again.

   Microsoft Exchange Administrator
   ID no: c10312c6

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Windows NT version 4.0 has introduced stricter registry security, which in
effect does not allow accounts without Windows NT Administrator rights to
perform registry-based Administrator operations, including configuring
connectors (as above), setting diagnostics logging, and so on.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
There is no workaround other than to give Windows NT Administrator rights
to the account that needs to be able to administer the connectors.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 4.0 of Exchange
Server on Windows NT 4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
