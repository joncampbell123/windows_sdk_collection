The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If an ampersand (&amp;) is included as part of a Microsoft Exchange
Organization name, it will not cause any routing or addressing problems.
The Distinguished Name (DN) will show the Organization name exactly as it
was typed. However, the X.400 addresses that are generated will have a
question mark (?) substituted for the ampersand and the name will be
truncated to 16 characters (per the X.400 specifications).
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
X.400 does not allow an ampersand in addresses, so the question mark is
substituted. The fact that the DN shows a different literal string for the
Organization name compared to the X.400 Address suggests, at first glance,
that this might be a source of problems. However, this is not true. The
X.400 Address and the DN are used for totally different processes. No
attempt to make these two items look the same should be made. This is by
design.
<P>
When you one-off address a message to another user (to test a site/X.400
connector, for example), the X.400 address should be typed just as it
appears on the Email Addresses property page for that recipient in the
Microsoft Exchange Administrator program.
<P>
For additional information about the printable character set, please see
the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : X400: Address Syntax

</PRE>This is the character set that is allowed in messaging systems that conform
to the X.400 series of specifications. This information can also be found
in the X.409 Specification, which is contained in the CCITT (The
International Telegraph &amp; Telephone Consultative Committee) Red Book volume
VIII-fascicle VIII.7.
