<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Exchange Server message transfer agent (MTA) may fail to
deliver messages between servers that are connected via a schedulable
connector (such as X.400 or Dynamic RAS), and in turn generate the
following Event Ids in the Application Event Log:
<P>
<PRE>   MSExchangeMTA Event ID: 37
   Type: Warning
   Category: Security
   The
   /O=OrganizationName/OU=SiteName/CN=Configuration/CN=Connections/CN=Conne
   ct orName (Adjacent-MTA) entity attempted to open an association while
   suspended. [MTA XFER-IN 22 35] (14)

   MSExchangeMTA Event ID: 1293
   Type: Warning
   Category: X.400 Service
   A remotely-initiated association from
   /O=OrganizationName/OU=SiteName/CN=Configuration/CN=Connections
   /CN=ConnectorName was refused. The failure reason provider is 0 and the
   reason is 0. Control block index 1. Type 1. [PLATFORM KERNEL 26 128]
   (12)

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
If the Event ID 37 is generated, it is an indication that a schedulable
connector on the Exchange Server computer that logged the event is
currently configured for a connection schedule of "Never," which indicates
that the connector will neither accept nor initiate a connection to another
Exchange Server computer. Therefore, when another MTA attempts to make a
connection to this Exchange Server computer, it is refused because the
current schedule set for this connector is configured as "Never." The
Exchange Server computer attempting to initiate the connection with the
Exchange Server computer where the connector is currently configured for a
connection schedule of "Never" will typically log one or more of the
following events upon failure of the attempted connection:
<P>
<PRE>   MSExchangeMTA Event ID: 1290
   Type: Warning
   Category: X.400 Service
   A locally initiated association to
   /O=OrganizationName/OU=SiteName/CN=Configuration/CN=Connections
   /CN=ConnectorName was refused. The failure reason provider was 0 and the
   reason was 0. Control block index 202. Type 1. [PLATFORM KERNEL 20 130]
   (12)

   MSExchangeMTA Event ID: 289
   Type: Warning
   Category: X.400 Service
   A connection to
   /O=OrganizationName/OU=SiteName/CN=Configuration/CN=Connections/CN=Conne
   ctorName could not be opened. [MTA XFER-IN 17 26] (12)

   MSExchangeMTA Event ID: 1294
   Type: Warning
   Category: X.400 Service
   An association with entity
   /O=OrganizationName/OU=SiteName/CN=Configuration
   /CN=Connections/CN=ConnectorName ended abnormally. [198 1 0 1 PLATFORM
   KERNEL 20 130] (10)

</PRE><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
In order for the MTAs to communicate successfully via a configured
connector, each connector involved must be configured for a connection
schedule other than "Never". The Schedule tab on the connector's property
page provides control over when the connector is available.
