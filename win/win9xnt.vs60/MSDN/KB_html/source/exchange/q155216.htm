The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
It may be necessary, due to performance or other reasons, to replace a
Microsoft Exchange Server computer with a new, more powerful system.
<P>
This article explains how to move Microsoft Exchange Server to a new
computer, assuming that the old computer will be off the network and the
new computer will have the same name as the old computer.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Before moving Microsoft Exchange Server to the new computer, verify that
the computer to be moved is not the only Windows NT domain controller in
the domain. While this computer is shut down as part of the moving
procedure, there must be a domain controller that can validate logon
requests.
<P>
If the computer to be moved is a primary domain controller (PDC), make sure
that there is at least one other backup domain controller (BDC) in the
Windows NT domain. After shutting down the computer to be moved, upgrade
the BDC to a PDC.
<P>
If the computer to be moved is a BDC, make sure that the PDC in the domain
is up and operational or that there are other BDCs that can be upgraded to
become the PDC.
<P>
The steps below explain how to move Microsoft Exchange Server to the new
computer:

<OL><P><LI> On the old computer, stop all the Exchange Services.
</OL>2.  Copy the entire Exchsrvr directory to another computer on the network,
<PRE>    or to a tape drive. If the Exchange log and database directories are
    on different drives, use the Performance Optimizer or the Exchange
    Administrator program (from the server object's properties) to move
    all the directories to their corresponding locations under the
    Exchsrvr directory where Exchange was installed. This should be done
    before backing up the Exchsrvr directory.
</PRE></OL>3.  Shut down the old computer. As explained above, make sure that there
<PRE>    is an operational domain controller in the Windows NT domain.
</PRE>4.  Install Windows NT on the new computer with the same computer name as
<PRE>    the old computer. If necessary, make it a BDC.
</PRE>5.  Run Setup to install Microsoft Exchange Server on this new computer
<PRE>    using the same site and organization names as the installation on the
    old computer. Do not select the option to join an existing site.
    Instead, choose to create a new site. Select the same Exchange
    service account that was used on the old machine. Make sure to
    install all the connectors that were installed on the old computer.
    To do this, select the Custom installation option. Do not run the
    Performance Optimizer at the end of the Setup program. Upgrade to
    the same Service Pack as was installed on the old machine.
</PRE>6.  Stop all the Exchange Services.
7.  Copy the backed up Exchsrvr directory over the Exchsrvr directory on
<PRE>    the new computer.
</PRE>8.  Use Performance Optimizer to make any desired changes.
9.  Start the Exchange Services. 
<P>
<PRE>    If an error 1011 occurs when starting the Information Store, at a 
    command prompt in the Exchsrvr\bin directory, enter the following 
    command:

       Isinteg -patch

</PRE><P><LI>Connectors may need to be reconfigured.
<P>
</OL>Microsoft Exchange should now be running on the new computer in the same
way it was on the old computer. Microsoft Exchange clients should be able
to connect to the new computer just as they connected to the old computer.
