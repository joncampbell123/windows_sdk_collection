The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0 and 5.5
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you try to move or copy a message created with a custom E-form from a
public folder to a folder in your mailbox or a PST file, you may encounter
the following error message in the Exchange Client:
<P>
<PRE>   An item could not be copied. There is not enough memory available to
   perform the operation.

</PRE>If you perform the same operation in the Outlook Client, you will receive
the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Can't copy the items. Could not make another copy of the item. The
   original was either moved or deleted, or access was denied.

</PRE>As a result of this error, the E-form message that you are trying to move
or copy is not copied or moved to the destination.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The E-form message contains fields that can be multi-propertied. One or
more of these properties is null, which causes the error when you try to
move or copy it to another location.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this issue, use version 1461.3 of Store.exe and the
following associated supporting files for Exchange Server 5.0:
<P>
<PRE>   Store.exe 1461.3 (or use 5.0 SP3)
   MDBMSG 1461.3 (or use 5.0 SP3)
   Gapi32.dll 1460.8 (or use 5.0 SP3)

</PRE>or use version 2138.0 for Exchange Server 5.5.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
versions 5.0 and 5.5
A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested
and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem.
Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix.
Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
