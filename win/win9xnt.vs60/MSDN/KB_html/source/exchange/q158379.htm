The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The following event IDs appear in the Application Event log:
<P>
<PRE>   Event ID 2380   MSExchangeMSMI

   A memory access violation has occurred that prevents further processing
   of a message. The access violation that occurred is an attempt to read
   from 0. Please refer to the immediately following event(s) logged by MS
   Mail Connector Interchange for more information on the message that
   could not be processed.

   Event ID 2446/2447   MSExchangeMSMI

   MS Mail Connector Interchange has failed processing message from
   Exchange. The message is left in the delivery queue. Use the MS Exchange
   Administrator to view the details for this message or remove it from the
   queue. This message entitled "&lt;message subject&gt;" is from &lt;message
   sender&gt;. This error message will be logged again the next time MS
   Connector is restarted if the message is not removed from the queue.

</PRE>The message stays queued in the message transfer agent (MTA) and cannot be
deleted. Trying to delete one of these messages results in the following
error message:
<P>
<PRE>   The object is not valid. Microsoft Exchange Administrator ID no:
   c1035b3c.

</PRE>The event IDs 2380 and 2446/2447 are logged for each message queued
in the MTA, each time the MSExchangeMSMI service is restarted.
<P>
A zero length ATT file is created and orphaned in the Maildata\Att
directory of the Microsoft Mail Connector.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
These symptoms occur when you receive a message by means of the Internet
Mail Connector that contains a REPLY-TO address that cannot be understood
by the Microsoft Mail Connector.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
4.0.
This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange 4.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):
