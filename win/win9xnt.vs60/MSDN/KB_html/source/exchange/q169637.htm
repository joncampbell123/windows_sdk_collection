The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0 and 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Routing and Remote Access Service Update for Windows NT
   Server 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Routing and Remote Access Service (RAS) provides normal RAS
functionality as well as demand-dial network connectivity. Thus, Routing
and Remote Access can be used to dynamically connect Microsoft Exchange
Server computers via RAS, X.400 Connector, or Site Connector using the
demand-dial feature of Routing and Remote Access. The demand-dial X.400
connector may increase cost of the connection and requires minor
modifications to the default connector override settings. Because there is
no scheduling ability with the site connector, it will hold the connection
open as long as possible.
<P>
Configuring Routing and Remote Access for demand-dial is covered in detail
in Chapter 4 of the "Routing and Remote Access Administrator's Guide"
included with the download package. Use the helpful hints listed below with
the information in the administrator's guide to configure demand-dial for
your Microsoft Exchange Server.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Any default gateway defined in the TCP/IP configuration on the Routing and
Remote Access server should be removed. This server is now a router and all
routes must be manually defined or configured to use RIP of OSPF for
dynamic updates. Default routes can be used as long as their impact is
fully understood.
<P>
When creating a demand-dial interface, the name of the interface must match
the name of the account that is added to the accounts database of the
remote router. This is, in effect, a service account for the router. For
more information on configuring demand-dial interfaces, please see the
"Administrator's Guide" or the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../winnt/q159684.htm">Q159684</A></B>
   TITLE     : Configuring Routing and Remote Access Dial-up Interfaces

</PRE>When prompted to enter the phone number or IP address of the remote router,
enter the phone number of the remote server. The remote network will be
defined as a route.
<P>
Network routes are defined by a network ID, subnet mask, gateway address,
interface, and metric. For example, 10.0.0.0 is a network ID using a subnet
mask of 255.0.0.0. The gateway address will be the address of the dial-up
interface on the remote router. This address will be determined by the
network configuration you provide in the Routing and Remote Access Port
Configuration (in the Network settings dialog box). If you are using a
static pool of address, the first IP address is excluded from the range of
available IP addresses. You must create a static route for the remote
network that uses the demand-dial interface.
<P>
Configure the X.400 Connector as if it were making a LAN connection and
make the following modifications on the Override tab of the connector.

<OL><P><LI>In the Association Parameters section, adjust the Lifetime (sec) value
   and the Disconnect (sec) to a value of 15. This minimizes the amount of
   time the connection is maintained after network traffic has ceased.

<P><LI>In the Connection Retry Values section, adjust Max Transfer Retries to a
   value of 5. Testing has shown that the connection may require more than
   the default of 2 attempts to complete successfully.

<P><LI>Adjust the Open Interval (sec) value to 15. This minimizes the amount of
   time the MTA will wait before it attempts to reestablish a lost or
   disrupted association.

<P><LI>For the Site Connector, simply configure it as if you were on a local
   LAN segment.
