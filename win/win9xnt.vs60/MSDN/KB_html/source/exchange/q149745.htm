The Information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When a user who is not a member of the local administrator group attempts
to install a Microsoft Exchange Client for Windows NT on a Windows NT
Workstation or Windows NT Server using the NTFS file system, and a local
administrator has never logged onto the computer and run the Microsoft
Exchange Client Setup, the setup process will get approximately 61% of the
way through and then crash. The following information, among other things,
is displayed in the Dr. Watson log:
<P>
<PRE>   Application exception occurred:
      App:  [Pid number of occurrence]
      Time: [Time of occurrence]
      Exception number: c0000005 (access violation)

</PRE>The access violation is the error.
<P>
The above information is only applicable when you attempt install from the
.CAB files. The symptoms are slightly different when you attempt to install
from a shared install point (created by an administrator running SETUP /A).
In this case, instead of receiving a Dr. Watson log, the user will receive
a messagebox informing them that the installation was unsuccessful but not
giving a reason.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When Windows NT is installed, the Mapi.dll file is installed into the
%WINNT%\SYSTEM32 directory with Read permissions (RX) for everyone, except
the members of the administrator group who have Full permissions. During
installation of the Microsoft Exchange Client for Windows NT, the Mapi.dll
must be upgraded and the rights to this file must be changed to Change
rights (RWXD). If the user attempting the install is not a member of the
local administrators group, this file cannot be upgraded nor can the rights
be changed. This causes the crash.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
The first user who attempts to install the Microsoft Exchange Client for
Windows NT on this computer must be a member of the local administrator
group.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 4.0 of the
Microsoft Exchange Client for Windows NT. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
