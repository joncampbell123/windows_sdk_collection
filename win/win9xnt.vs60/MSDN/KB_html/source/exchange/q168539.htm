IMPORTANT: This article contains information about using Registry Editor.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you delete the Microsoft Mail Connector (MSMC) and then try to delete
the dirsync server object, the following error message appears :
<P>
<PRE>   THE ATTRIBUTE DOES NOT EXIST
   Microsoft Exchange dir: ID NO: DS_E_NO_SUCH_ATTRIBUTE_OR_VALUE

</PRE><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall Windows. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be
solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and
Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" online Help
topics in Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before
you edit it.
<P>
WARNING: Using the raw mode of the Exchange Server Administrator program
(admin /r) incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to
reinstall Microsoft Windows NT Server and/or Microsoft Exchange Server.
Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use
of raw mode can be solved. Use raw mode at your own risk.
<P>
To resolve this problem:

<OL><P><LI>Verify that there is no requestor object under this dirsync server
   object.

<P><LI>Verify that the Exchange Directory Synchronization service is not
   running by inspecting Control Panel Services.

<P><LI>Start Registry Editor. Go to the following key
<P>
<P><PRE>      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services
</PRE><P>
   and confirm that the MSExchangeDX service does not exist.

<P><LI>Start the Exchange Server Administrator program in raw mode by typing
   the following at a command prompt:
<P>
<PRE>        admin /r

</PRE><P><LI>Select the Dirsync Server to highlight it. On the Edit menu, click
   Delete Raw Object

<P><LI>Click OK in response to the following warning message:
<P>
<P><PRE>      A raw delete should not be performed without prior consultation with
      Microsoft Product Support Services. Do not proceed unless you
      completely understand the potential adverse effects that incorrect
      usage of this feature could have on an entire site.
