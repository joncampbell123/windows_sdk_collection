The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Windows 95 client, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you attempt to look properties of the Microsoft Exchange client,
either by means of the Control Panel Mail utility or by right-clicking the
Inbox on the desktop, you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Title : Mail
   You need more memory or system resources.  Close some windows and try
   again.

</PRE>Or, you may see the following symptom. When you attempt to start the
Exchange client, the splash screen appears for only a moment and the client
does not start.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The incorrect mapi32.dll file exists in the Win95/system directory. This
problem may occur if a component is removed and again added out of the
properties for network neighborhood (control panel/network) and mapi32.dll
from Win95 replaces the Exchange mapi32.dll from the Exchange client.
<P>
When a network neighborhood component is removed and re-added on a computer
that has the Exchange client installed, the user should be prompted with
the following during the "copying files" stage:
<P>
<PRE>   "A file being copied is older than the file currrently on your computer.
   It is recommended that you keep your existing file.
   File name mapi32.dll
   Description Extended MAPI 1.0 for Windows 95
   Your version 4.0.xxxxxxxxxxx
   Do you want to keep this file?

</PRE>If you click No, the Windows 95 version of Mapi32.dll overwrites the
newer Mapi32.dll.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this problem, do one of the following:

<UL><LI>Reinstall the Exchange client.
<P>
</UL>-OR-

<UL><LI>Copy Mapi32.dll from another (working) computer running the Exchange
   Windows 95 client.
<P>
</UL>-OR-

<UL><LI>Expand Mapi32.dll from the Exchange client cabinet (cab) files:

</UL><OL><P><LI>From a command prompt, change directory to the location of the Exchange
   Cab files (CD or netlocation)

<P><LI>Carry out the command:
<P>
<P><PRE>      extract  /l c:\win95\system exchng5.cab mapi32.dll
</PRE><P>
</OL>NOTE: The size and date of this file will differ, depending on which
version of Exchange client is installed.
