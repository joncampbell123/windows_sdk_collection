The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0
</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Exchange administrators have the ability to support roving users
running from a network installation of Windows 3.1 and 3.11. Roving users
are individuals that are not tied to a specific machine. They need access
to their Microsoft Exchange accounts regardless of their physical location
on the network.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Administrators can run the following steps to create a default profile that
can be customized for each Microsoft Exchange Windows client user:

<OL><P><LI>The network administrator will need to create home directories on the
   network for each user and assign logon scripts that will automatically
   connect those users to their home directory.

<P><LI>From the Microsoft Exchange Win16 client share point, run SETUP /a to
   create a network installation of the Microsoft Exchange Win16 client.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: You must be logged in with Administrator privileges and be running
the same shared copy of Windows that the users will be running. This is
because the network installation will add files to the WINDOWS\SYSTEM
directory that are required by the Microsoft Exchange client.

<OL><P><LI>Run the Microsoft Exchange Setup Editor against this network client
   installation share point to make any desired changes in the Setup
   Options a user will see when running the client Setup Program. The
   Microsoft Exchange Setup Editor can also be used to modify default
   Microsoft Exchange user profile information. Save the changes you have
   made and exit the Setup Editor. This will modify the SETUP.STF file in
   the client network installation directory and create a file called
   DEFAULT.PRF if it does not already exist.

<P><LI>Each user should be configured to run Windows from the network.

<P><LI>Each user should now run SETUP.EXE from the Microsoft Exchange Win16
   client network installation point. Select the Workstation installation
   option. This will install the client so that it runs from the server.
   The Setup program will now create the user's default profile, based on
   the settings in the DEFAULT.PRF file in the client network installation
   share point. This default profile will be created in the user's home
   directory on the server if the user is set up to run Windows from this
   directory.

<P><LI>Each user should now be able to move to any similarly configured
   machine, running Windows from the network, and be able to run the
   Microsoft Exchange client using the same profile.
