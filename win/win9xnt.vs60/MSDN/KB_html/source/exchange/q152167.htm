<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article is a "how to" that applies to MS Mail directory
synchronization (dir-sync) when the dir-sync server is a computer running
Microsoft Exchange Server and other computers running Microsoft Exchange
Server are servicing other MS Mail postoffices.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In this example there are two MS Mail postoffices(PO1 and PO2) and two
computers running Microsoft Exchange Server (X1 and X2). Each MS Mail
postoffice being serviced by a single computer running Microsoft Exchange
Server over the MS Mail Connector service. Configure as follows: PO1
configured as direct to X1 and X1 configured as direct to PO1. PO2
configured as direct to X2 and X2 configured as direct to PO2.

<OL><P><LI>Configure the MS Mail Connector to communicate with MS Mail
    postoffices(X1 to PO1 and X2 to PO2).

<P><LI>PO1 to X2(shadow PO) via X1(shadow PO), PO1 to PO2 via X1(shadow PO).

<P><LI>PO2 to X1(shadow PO) via X2(shadow PO), PO2 to PO1 via X2(shadow PO).

<P><LI>Create a new Custom Recipients container(call it something like
    MSMail Recipients).
<P>
</OL>From the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program on the computer running
Microsoft Exchange Server, which will be
the Directory Synchronization Server:

<OL><P><LI>Create a Site Connector between X1 and X2.

<P><LI>Create a Directory Replication Connector between X1 and X2--allow
    time for replication, which this may take several minutes.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click New Custom Recipient, and click Microsoft Mail
    Address. Type Network/PostOffice and a user name of $system for every
    MS Mail postoffice not being serviced directly by the directory
    synchronization server(all are being serviced via MS Mail Connector on
    X2 Microsoft Exchange server in this example).

<P><LI>Create a Directory Synchronization Server: on the File menu, click New
    Other, and click Directory Synchronization Server.

<P><LI>Create Directory Synchronization requesters: on the File Menu, click
    New Other, and click Remote Dir-Sync Requestor. The direct defined
    postoffices will be listed. Select each entry listed (each MS Mail
    postoffice that will participate in dir-sync). This will need to be
    done with every MS Mail postoffice requestor.
<P>
</OL>When creating/defining the requestor for the MS Mail postoffices not
serviced by the Director Synchronization server, do the following:
<P>
From the Microsoft Exchange Administrator Program on the computer running
Microsoft Exchange Server, which will be the Directory Synchronization
Server:

<OL><P><LI>On the File menu, click New Other and click Remote Dir-Sync Requestor.
<P><PRE>    Select &lt;non msmail requestor&gt;, click the Dir-Sync Address tab and pick
    the custom recipient network/postoffice/$system (the custom recipient
    created in step 4 above (this must be done for every non-serviced MS
    Mail requestor).
</PRE>
<P><LI>Start the Microsoft Exchange Directory Synchronization service and the
<P><PRE>    MS Mail Connector service. Stop and restart the Microsoft Exchange
    Message Transfer Agent service(on both computers running Microsoft
    Exchange Servers), as well as any MTA services that were created when
    defining the MS Mail postoffices that are serviced by the Directory
    Synchronization server.
