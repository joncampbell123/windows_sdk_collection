The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server versions 4.0 and 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs in a situation where a distribution list is created on
a server. On the Advanced tab of its properties in the Exchange Server
Administrator program, the Report to Message Originator checkbox is
cleared. The membership of the distribution list consists of users on this
server and other servers.
<P>
A message is now sent to the distribution list with a request for read
receipts and/or delivery receipts. The expected behavior is that no read
receipts and/or delivery receipts from individual recipients will be
generated. However, if the recipient is located on a server other than the
originating server, a read or delivery receipt is generated.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When the mail is sent to a DL (the PRIV_DL_REPORT_TO_ORIG bit of which is
off) on Server1 that has recipients on both Server1 and Server2 with
Read/Delivery Receipts requested, the message is transferred to Server2,
with the PR_DL_REPORT_FLAGS preserved on the envelope. However, the store
on the receiving end fails to suppress reports based on the flags.
Consequently the store delivers to recipients on Server2 and emits
Read/Delivery Receipts.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0.
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0.
This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on obtaining the
Service Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge
