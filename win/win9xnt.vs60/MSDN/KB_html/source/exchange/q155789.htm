<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If a Microsoft Exchange Messaging Connector and a Microsoft Exchange
Replication Connector have been set up between two Microsoft Exchange Sites
and you no longer want either of the Sites to know about the other as if
replication had never occurred, you can simply delete the Replication
Connector. All data that had been replicated via the connector will
automatically be deleted over a period of time.
<P>
It is also a good idea to run a Knowledge Consistency Check after deleting 
the Replication Connector in order for the data to be updated immediately.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Deleting a Replication Connector does not just prohibit any new additions
and deletions from being made to the Microsoft Exchange Directory. It
actually causes the Directory to be returned to its original state, as if
replication had never occurred.
<P>
To delete the Replication Connector, simply press Delete while the
Replication Connector is highlighted in the Microsoft Exchange
Administrator program. This will generate the following message:
<P>
<PRE>   Deleting the directory replication connector that connects with Site
   'site name' will stop replication with that site. To re-establish
   replication with that site, you must add a new directory replication
   connector. Are you sure you want to delete the directory replication
   connector?.

</PRE>Click Yes. You will then get a prompt asking if you want to delete the
replication connector in the remote site also. After clicking Yes, you will
get the following confirmation:
<P>
<PRE>   The directory replication connector has been deleted from both the local
   site and the remote site. Allow up to an hour for replicated data to be
   completely deleted."
