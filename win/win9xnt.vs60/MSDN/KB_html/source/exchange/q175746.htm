The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Microsoft Exchange Server versions 4.0, 5.0, and 5.5
 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article discusses how to specify the container in which directory
updates propagated to Exchange are placed.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
By default, when user information is propagated to Exchange, the
Distinguished Name (DN) mapping rule determines what object is created
within the Exchange hierarchy and where the custom recipients are located.
By default, Lotus Notes users being propagated to Exchange will have a
container created for them under the Recipients container whose DN is that
of the Notes organization name. This container will contain custom
recipient objects that represent all the Lotus Notes person documents
propagated to Exchange.
<P>
To modify the default mapping rule and place the users in a container
called Runningman, modify the default rule listed below using the LinkAge
Administrator:

<OL><P><LI>Shut down the Directory Exchange processes. To do this, in the LinkAge
   Administrator, expand Directory Exchange Manager, Directory Exchange
   Manager Server, and Status. Suspend all three processes. If these
   services are enabled, you cannot modify the mapping rules.

<P><LI>To edit the mapping rules, in the LinkAge Administrator user interface,
   expand Directory Exchange Manager, Directory Classes, Exchange, and
   Mapping Rules.

<P><LI>Change the source class to Notes in the drop-down box, and double-click
   DN Rule to modify the mapping rule. Click OK when prompted.
  
</OL>Default mapping rule:
"/O=&lt;Exchange Org. Name&gt;/OU=&lt;Exchange Site Name&gt;/CN=Recipients"
AND("/CN=",X500(fullname,"O")) AND("/CN=",X500(fullname,"OU"))
AND("/CN=",X500(fullname,"CN")) ISEQUAL(X500(fullname,"CN"),"","/CN="
STRIP(fullname,";","L","R"),"")
<P>
With no modifications, the above default mapping rule will create a new
container in the Recipients container whose DN and Display Name is that of
the Notes organization. All Notes person documents will have a
corresponding custom recipient created and placed in this container. If you
want to create the container at the same level as the Recipient container,
assign CN the value of the new container, for example, Runningman.
<P>
"/O=&lt;Org. Name&gt;/OU=&lt;Site Name&gt;/CN=Runningman"
AND("/CN=",X500(fullname,"O")) AND("/CN=",X500(fullname,"OU"))
AND("/CN=",X500(fullname,"CN")) ISEQUAL(X500(fullname,"CN"),"","/CN="
STRIP(fullname,";","L","R"),"")
<PRE>  
</PRE></OL>The above mapping rule will create a new container called Runningman at the
same level as the Recipients container and create a container within this
new container whose directory name is that of the Notes organization. All
Notes custom recipients will be placed within this container.
<P>
A mapping rule of:
"/O=&lt;Org. Name&gt;/OU=&lt;Site Name&gt;/CN=Runningman”
<P>
would create a container called Runningman at the same level as the
Recipients container and place all Notes person documents within this
container.
<P>
Each change of the mapping rules requires a remap of entries in the Master
Mapping Directory (MMD). To do this, enable the three processes suspended
earlier, and then click the Remap button. Wait until the process has
completed before attempting further directory synchronization.
<PRE>  
</PRE>For Exchange 5.5, the DN attribute is used to store the UNID value from
Notes. By default, in version 5.5 the Notes custom recipients are stored in
the Recipients container. To have them stored in another container, do the
following:
1. Create the required container in the Exchange Administrator.
2. Using the property pages for the Notes connector, click the Import
<PRE>   Container tab and choose the desired container.
