The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Messages sent to Microsoft Mail recipients through the Microsoft Exchange
Internet Mail Connector (IMC) can result in duplicate messages. The sent
and recv logs show the message is received and delivered multiple times.
The number of duplicate copies received by an individual is equal to the
number of Microsoft Mail recipients that are on the recipient list.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Any message received by the Exchange IMC has a responsibility flag set.
However, the Windows NT, OS/2, and MS-DOS Multitasking Message Transfer
Agent (MMTA) products do not understand the responsibility flag, and
External delivers the message to each Microsoft Mail recipient that it
finds.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem:

<UL><LI>If the originating system is a Sendmail V8 or IDA Sendmail, set the mail
   delivery flag to allow a single message for multiple recipients.
<P>
</UL>-or-

<UL><LI>Use of the Microsoft MSMI should also eliminate duplicate messages but
   this requires replacing existing instances of external with MSMI
   connectors.
<P>
</UL><h2>REFERENCE</h2>
 
<P>
For more information, see the Sendmail book published by O'Reilly and
Associates.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in External.exe version 3.5. A
supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested
and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem.
Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix.
Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
