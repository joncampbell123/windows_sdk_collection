<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The Macintosh computer appears to hang after a period of time with the
Exchange Client running.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The current revisions of the Exchange Macintosh client use polling to check
for mail (at approximately 70-second intervals) and not push notification.
The networking calls for this polling are via synchronous RPC calls (as all
Exchange clients are). This means that if the request is not responded to
(either because the server is down or very busy) the process will wait.
This is why the Macintosh computer hangs, or appears to hangs.  A
cooperative multi-tasking operating system like the Macintosh, Windows, and
Windows For Workgroups blocks the synchronous calls until responded to.
This behavior exists in the Windows 95 and Windows NT Exchange Clients, but
is not a problem because they use preemptive multi-tasking, which hangs the
Exchange session without disturbing other running applications.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Outlook 8.0 Client for Macintosh has been modified to prevent
this behavior by implementing a timeout parameter that resets and clears
the client polling communications call with the server, if it does not
receive a reply within a period of time. This is only available for Power
Macintosh computer.
