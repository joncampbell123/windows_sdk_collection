<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When Microsoft Exchange clients try to connect to the Microsoft Exchange
Server over the Internet, the following error may be received.
<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft Exchange could not be started. Network problems are preventing
   connection to the Microsoft Exchange Server computer. Contact your
   system administrator if this condition persists."

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When it tries to connect to the Microsoft Exchange server over the
Internet, the Microsoft Exchange client needs to be able to get the IP
address of the Microsoft Exchange server from the Fully Qualified Domain
Name (DNS Name) of the Microsoft Exchange Server. This can be achieved
through two ways:

<OL><P><LI>The client has access to a DNS that is aware of the Microsoft Exchange
   Server.
</OL>2. The client computer has a local HOSTS file with an entry for the
<PRE>   Microsoft Exchange Server computer.

</PRE></OL>In most cases, the client will have to have a local HOSTS file, since most
DNS's on the Internet will not have information about the Microsoft
Exchange Server in their tables.
<P>
NOTE: When creating a Microsoft Exchange profile on the client computer, it
is possible to enter an IP address as the Microsoft Exchange server name.
The RPC TCP/IP runtime routines know how to use a raw TCP/IP address to
connect to the server, but the DNS name is what gets stored in the profile.
Hence, there must be a DNS entry or local HOSTS file entry for the
Microsoft Exchange Server in order for the client to contact the server.
<P>
To verify that the client is able to communicate with the server, the
following tests could be run:

<OL><P><LI>Ping the Microsoft Exchange Server name. This should tell us whether
   TCP/IP connectivity is available.
</OL>2. If you are able to "Ping" the server, use the RPC Ping utility to test
<PRE>   RPC Connectivity with the server. This utility, present in the Microsoft
   Exchange Server CD in the Support\Rpcping directory, has two components,
   one to be run on the server and the other to be run on the client
   computer.

</PRE></OL>If there are problems with the RPC Connectivity, check to see if the server
is located behind a firewall. If a firewall is being used, it will need to
configured to allow access to the ports on the Microsoft  Exchange Server
that are used by Microsoft Exchange. Please refer to the Microsoft Exchange
Server Release Notes for more information on "Setting TCP/IP Port Numbers
for Internet Firewalls"
