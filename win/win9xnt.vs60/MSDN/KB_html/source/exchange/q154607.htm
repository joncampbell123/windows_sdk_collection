<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you configure the Microsoft Exchange client for offline
synchronization, the complete mailbox hierarchy is replicated to the
offline folder file (OST), even though some of the folders are not
configured for offline use. This makes it possible for you to delete a non-
replicated folder while working offline. When you start to work online
again and synchronization takes place, the non-replicated folder and its
contents are deleted from the mailbox.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by product design.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to reproduce:</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start Microsoft Exchange client configured for local replication and
   choose Connect when prompted for a connection type.

<P><LI>Create a folder called Test and copy several items to it. Make sure this
   folder is not configured as an offline folder.

<P><LI>Quit Exchange.

<P><LI>Start Exchange Client and choose Work Offline when prompted for a
   connection type. Notice the Test folder appears to be empty, although it
   is not.

<P><LI>Delete the Test folder. No error message results. However, the folder is
   moved to the Deleted Items folder.

<P><LI>Quit Exchange. By default, this will purge the Deleted Items folder and
   delete the Test folder from the Exchange hierarchy.

<P><LI>Start Microsoft Exchange client and choose Connect when prompted for a
   connection type.
<P>
</OL>Results:
The folder hierarchy is automatically synchronized, removing the
Test folder and its contents.
