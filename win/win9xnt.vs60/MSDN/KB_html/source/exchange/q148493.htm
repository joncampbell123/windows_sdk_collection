<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0 and 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0 and 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Exchange Windows 95 client, versions 4.0 and 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Exchange Client can download an Offline Address Book from the
Microsoft Exchange Server. This Offline Address Book (OAB) can be used when
the client is not connected to the server and is running offline.
<P>
The location of the Offline Address Book is not configurable through the
Exchange client. By default the Offline Address Book is kept in the Windows
directory. The Microsoft Exchange Administrator can use the Microsoft
Exchange Setup Editor to specify a new path for the Offline Address Book.
This however needs to be done before the clients are installed.
<P>
This article describes how to change the location of the Offline Address
Book file on the client computer after the Exchange client has been
installed.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The path to the Offline Address Book is saved in the user's profile. In
order to change the location of the Offline Address Book, a new profile
will need to be created. The "Mail &amp; Fax" applet in Control Panel, does not
allow the location of the OAB to be specified when creating a new profile.
To control where the OAB files will be placed, a new profile must be
created using the Automatic Profile Generator (Newprof.exe).
<P>
<P><h3>How to Create a New Profile by Using Newprof.exe</h3>
 
<P>
Newprof.exe, the Automatic Profile Generator, reads a file (Default.prf)
and creates a profile based on the settings in this file. One of the
settings in this file specifies the location of the Offline Address Book.
<P>
If the Automatic Profile Generator was used to create a profile when the
client was installed, the Default.prf file should be present in the
Windows directory on the client computer.

<OL><P><LI>If the Default.prf file is present, edit the file using a text editor
   such as Notepad, and complete these steps:
<P>
   a. In the [Service2] section, add this entry:
<P>
<PRE>         OfflineAddressBookPath= &lt;path to the offline Address Book&gt;

      If this entry already exists, modify the path to be what you want.

   b. In the [General] section, change the value of the ProfileName entry
      to be the name that you want the new profile to have.

   c. Save the file, and exit out of the text editor.

</PRE><P><LI>If Default.prf is not present in the Windows directory, check the
   Microsoft Exchange Client installation share point on the server that
   was used to install the Microsoft Exchange client. If Default.prf does
   not exist in that share, run the Microsoft Exchange Setup Editor against
   that share point. From the File Menu, choose Set User Options to bring
   up the User Options settings. Select the Home Server property page. Set
   the Offline Address Book Path on this page. Click OK and then exit the
   Setup Editor. The file, Default.prf, should now be created in the
   Microsoft Exchange Client directory on the server. Edit this file and
   change the ProfileName entry to be name of the new profile. Copy
   Default.prf to the Windows directory on the client computer where you
   wish to create the new profile.

<P><LI>On the client computer, open up an MS-DOS command prompt.

<P><LI>Change to the directory where the Microsoft Exchange client is
   installed.

<P><LI>Run Newprof.exe -s to bring up a window.

<P><LI>Make sure that the Profile Descriptor File specified is Default.prf in
   the Windows directory.

<P><LI>Click the Execute button. The program should now create a new profile
   with the name specified in the .prf file.

<P><LI>Log into the Microsoft Exchange client with this new profile. The next
   time the OAB is downloaded, it will be saved in the new location
   specified in the .prf file used to create the profile.
