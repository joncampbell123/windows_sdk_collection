<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article provides descriptions of the logging categories on the message
transfer agent (MTA) of Exchange Server.

<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>X.400 Service</h3>

<P>
<P><h3>Resource</h3>
 
Events related to the use of MTA resources.
<P>
<P><h3>Security</h3>
 
Events related to attempted security violations.
<P>
<P><h3>Interface</h3>
 
Communication among MTA components and between MTAs. Includes RPC use.
<P>
<P><h3>Field Engineering</h3>

<P>
<P><h3>MTA Administration</h3>
 
Administration program access to MTA queues and routing information.
<P>

<P>
<P><h3>Operating System</h3>
 
Events related to the MTA's use of Windows NT functions, such as thread

<P>
<P><h3>Internal Processing</h3>
 
Events related to the internal operation of MTA application code. Error
events in this category indicate serious problems in the MTA.
<P>
<P><h3>Interoperability</h3>
 
Tracks the binary content of protocol messages. Use this category and
Interface to log stack traces and XAPI traces to MTADATA\AP*.LOG.

logging is turned up on this category.
<P>
<P><h3>APDU (Application Protocol Data Unit)</h3>
 
Tracks full P1 content (MTA send/receive) and fully encoded P1 APDU
(communication between remote MTAs) to diagnose interoperability or
conformance problems. Use this category and X.400 Service to log binary
data to MTADATA\BF*.LOG.
NOTE: No additional events are logged to the application or EV*.LOGs when
logging is turned up on this category.
<P>
EV*.LOGs are Text Event Logs. You can enable these logs by updating the
registry key TextEventLogging, using the following procedure.

may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor
can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
