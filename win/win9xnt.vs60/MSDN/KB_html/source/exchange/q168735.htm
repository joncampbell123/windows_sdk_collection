<P>
3.1  Requirements Before Updating
<P>
Before updating a server that has the Web Connector installed, the
following must be installed:
<P>
- Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3
- Active Server Pages 1.0b (distributed in Windows NT 4.0 SP3)
- Outlook Web Access does not support Microsoft Internet Information Server
(IIS) 4.0. For IIS 4.0 support, you must upgrade to Microsoft Exchange
Server version 5.5.
- Support for Microsoft and Netscape browsers version 4.0 or later requires
Outlook Web Access version 5.5.
<P>
3.2  Chinese Language Preferences
<P>
Web browsers can request Chinese Traditional (zh-tw) or Chinese Simplified
(zh-cn). Some browsers do not differentiate between Chinese Traditional and
Chinese Simplified when reporting their language preference to the server.
In cases where the browser does not specify a sublanguage, the most
recently installed language pack will be the default.  You can control what
language will be returned in these cases by the order in which you install
your Chinese language packs.
<P>
3.3  Anonymous Access
<P>
Anonymous access is not available to folders hosted on servers running
Windows NT 3.51 servers. To support anonymous folder access, the folders
must be hosted on a server running Windows NT 4.0.
<P>
3.4  Attachment Upload Requirements
<P>
When using Microsoft Internet Explorer for Windows 95 or Windows NT, you
must update to Internet Explorer 3.02 with the File Upload add-on to add
attachments to a message.
<P>
4.0  User Notes
<P>
4.1  Using Multiple Offline Address Books in the Administrator Program
<P>
Administrators can configure offline Address Books that remote users can
use to obtain information about other users in their organization. When
connecting remotely to a Microsoft Exchange Server computer, a user can
download an offline Address Book containing a list of recipients the
administrator specifies. Offline Address Books are stored in hidden public
folders.
<P>
Remote users typically send messages to a regular group of addresses and
require a subset of the global address list rather than the entire global
address list for their organization. For example, members of a marketing
group may need the addresses of the complete marketing and sales groups,
but not the entire set of engineering group addresses.
<P>
The Offline Address Book property page on the DS Site Configuration object
has been enhanced to allow you to generate and manipulate multiple offline
Address Books.
<P>
Defining Offline Address Book Properties
<P>
Use the Offline Address Book property page to set up multiple offline
Address Books.

<OL><P><LI>In the Administrator window, choose Configuration, and then double-click
</OL>DS Site Configuration.

<OL><P><LI>Select the Offline Address Book tab.

<P><LI>In the Offline Address Book Server box, select one of the servers in
</OL>your site.
<P>
Important  You must select a server running Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0 and Service Pack 1 or 2.

<OL><P><LI>To add containers for more offline Address Books, choose Add. To remove
</OL>offline Address Book containers, select a container, and then choose
Remove.

<OL><P><LI>To generate offline Address Books, choose Generate All.
<P>
</OL>The following options appear in the Offline Address Book property page:
<P>
Offline Address Book Server
The name of the server where you want to generate the offline Address Book.
<P>
Address Books
Displays a list of Address Books to be generated for the site being
administered.
<P>
Add
Displays a list of containers that can be added to the list of offline
Address Books.
<P>
Remove
Removes the selected offline Address Book from the list.
<P>
Generate All
Generates all displayed offline Address Books immediately.
<P>
4.2  Using Multiple Offline Address Books in the Client
<P>
Multiple offline Address Books require Microsoft Exchange Server 5.0 SP1 or
later and either Microsoft Exchange Client 5.0 SP1 or Outlook 8.02. When
the multiple offline Address Book feature is enabled on the server and a
user tries to download an offline Address Book (as in previous versions of
Microsoft Exchange Server), the user will be prompted with a dialog box
that lists all available Address Books. The user can select one of these
Address Books.
<P>
4.3  Windows File Types List for Microsoft Exchange Client for Macintosh
<P>
Under some circumstances, the Microsoft Exchange Macintosh Client sends and
receives e-mail by using only the data fork of the message. A new entry in
the preferences file (named "Windows File Types") lists file types for
which the Microsoft Exchange Client for Macintosh will use only the data
fork of the message. This feature improves interoperability between the
Microsoft Exchange Macintosh Client and other e-mail clients.
<P>
Types of Entries
There are two types of entries:
<P>
<PRE>        General extensions
        Specific extensions for creator and type

</PRE></OL>General Extensions
Users can add an entry using the following syntax:
<P>
<PRE>        EXT [Number]= .[Extension]

</PRE>All files that have this extension will be inserted in subsequent messages
as a data fork-only attachment. The default types are HTML, GIF, PDF, and
JPEG.
<P>
Specific Extensions for Creator and Type
Users can add an entry using the following syntax:
<P>
<PRE>        :[CREATOR]:[TYPE]= .[Extension]

</PRE>All files that have the specified creator and type will be inserted as a
data fork-only attachment. The extension will be added to the end of the
file name, unless it is already present.
<P>
4.4  Installing Internet Explorer 4.0 After Installing Microsoft Exchange
Server
<P>
If you need to run Internet Explorer and Microsoft Exchange Server on the
same computer, it is strongly recommended that you install Internet
Explorer 4.0 before installing Microsoft Exchange Server. If you install
Internet Explorer 4.0 after installing Microsoft Exchange Server, Internet
Explorer modifies the MIME registry database resulting in problems for
international mail, especially mail with double-byte character content. If
you installed Internet Explorer 4.0 after installing Microsoft Exchange
Server, complete the following procedure to correct this problem. You can
perform this procedure without stopping any Microsoft Exchange Server
services.
<P>
Note: This procedure is not required if you are installing Internet
Explorer 4.0 before you install Microsoft Exchange Server.

<OL><P><LI>Create a MIME directory on your local hard drive.
</OL>2. Download the compressed file SP2_50MM.EXE to your MIME directory.
3. At the Windows NT command prompt, switch to the WPapers directory and
then type SP2_50MM followed by -d to ensure that the correct directories
are created. (Example: SP2_50MM -d)
4. Right-click on the RESET.INF file in the MIME\Support Mimedb directory,
and then choose Install.
<P>
4.5  Macintosh Appledouble Attachments
<P>
If an Internet message is received with Appledouble attachments, such as
those generated by the Netscape mail client for Macintosh, the outbound
message format is always determined by defaults configured for the Internet
Mail Service or Internet protocols (IMAP4 and POP3), not by the incoming
message format.
<P>
4.6  Microsoft Exchange Server White Papers
<P>
To download Microsoft Exchange Server white papers:

<OL><P><LI>Create the subdirectory WPapers on your local hard drive.
</OL>2. Download the file SP2_50WH.EXE located in the Server subdirectory to
your WPapers subdirectory.
3. At the Windows NT command prompt, switch to the WPapers directory and
then type SP2_50WH followed by -d to ensure that the correct directories
are created. (Example: SP2_50WH -d)
<P>
The following Microsoft Exchange white papers have been included as a
convenience to you and can be found in the \Support\Whiteppr directory.
These documents can be viewed with Microsoft Word for Windows 95 or
Microsoft Word for Windows version 6.0.
<P>
