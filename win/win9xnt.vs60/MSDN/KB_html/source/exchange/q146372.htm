The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Windows 95 client, versions 4.0 and 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0 and 5.0

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
You cannot delete a network connection that has a reference to a file that
has been inserted into a message in the Exchange client. When you try to
delete the network connection from a DOS prompt you will receive this
error: " There are open files on the connection. Close all files and quit
all programs related to the connection before you try to delete". There is
more help available by typing NET HELPMSG 2404." If you try to disconnect
the drive from file manager, you get this error: "There are currently files
open on &lt;drive&gt;: connected to \\server\share. If you do not close the files
before disconnecting from the network device, data may be lost. Do you want
to disconnect the device anyway?" and you are given an option to disconnect
the drive.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This is caused by the Microsoft Exchange client keeping a open reference to
the last opened drive or directory. For example, if another message is
created referencing a file on a different share, the mapped drive letter
referencing the share in the first message can be now be deleted.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Exit and Log Off from of the Exchange client. You can then remove the
mapped drive through either the File Manager or the MS-DOS prompt using the
net use &lt;drive&gt; /d.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange version
4.0 clients. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
