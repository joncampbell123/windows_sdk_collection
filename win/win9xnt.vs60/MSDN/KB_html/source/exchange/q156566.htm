<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If you used Microsoft Mail before migrating to Microsoft Exchange, you
might have message files (MMF files) that you want to move to Microsoft
Exchange. To do so, you must convert the information from its original
format to a PST file. You can then add this file to your active profile. To
see the steps to import an MMF file, please see the Microsoft Exchange
Client Help topic on Importing MMF files. This article discusses the file
size differences between MMF and PST files.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
MMF Smaller than PST:
<P>
When an MMF file is converted to a PST file, the size difference will be
noticeable. The PST file will usually be larger than the original MMF file.
This is due to the way that PST files store Compressed RTF and Message Body
for each message. MMF files only store Message Body format and not the Compressed RTF format.
<P>
MMF imported into Microsoft Exchange Mailbox Folder:
<P>
Migrating the same MMF file to a Microsoft Exchange Server Mailbox folder
will cause less data to be stored on the Microsoft Exchange Server. This is
because it only stores the RTF part of the message and it is compressed.
Compressed RTF is usually smaller than the original plain-text body.
<P>
PST Smaller than MMF:
<P>
A non-compacted MMF file that is converted to a PST file can actually
yield a PST file that is smaller than the source MMF file. In addition, if
the source MMF file has corrupt messages in it, those messages will be
deleted by the migration utility, resulting in a smaller PST file.
<P>
TIP: To reduce the size of your MMF file, discard messages that you no
longer need and compact the file before importing it.
<P>
PST encryption is a direct byte substitution for the original data, so a
PST file with encryption will be the same size as an otherwise identical
PST file without encryption.
