<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
There are a number of non-trivial interoperability issues between Exchange
5.0 and 5.5 in RTF to HTML and Imail.  Some of the issues are the
following:

<OL><P><LI>If you create an HTML in any codepage OTHER then ANSI / ISO-8859-1 and
</OL>put some international characters between &lt;TT&gt; and &lt;/TT&gt;.  Then convert the
HTML round trip HTML-&gt;RTF-&gt;HTML the International characters between &lt;TT&gt;&gt;
and &lt;/TT&gt; are corrupted.  This corruption is permanent and can't be fixed
y changing the browser character set or font.
2. After HTML-&gt;RTF conversion, an extra space at the line following
&lt;Hn&gt;...&lt;/Hn&gt; is emitted.
3. Loss of background color and bad formatting of table cells. Incorrect
handling of &lt;TD&gt; ... &lt;TD&gt; sequence (with no &lt;/TD&gt;).
4. The background color information is appended as text output after HTML-
&gt;RTF-&gt;TEXT conversion.
5. The Body tag property is corrupted when converted to Unicode.
6. There is corruption of the &lt;TITLE&gt; tag of an embedded message when
converting to Unicode.
7. Foreign mail using extended Latin characters gets sent as US-ASCII with
all the accents stripped.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
The same corruption happens for any HTML tag implying monospace font, i.e.,
&lt;TT&gt;, &lt;KBD&gt;, &lt;SAMP&gt;, and &lt;CODE&gt;.  The problem is caused by not marking the
monospace font (second font in RTF font table) with the correct character
set, which means the font is treated as ANSI.
<P>
Since cell formatting is independent of the formatting outside of the table
(IE and NN behavior), we now save and restore overlapping tag stack around
tables and emit \plain keyword in RTF at the table start. Also, we make
sure any new cell terminates the previous one and any cell formatting is
ind
pendent of each other (e.g., FONT started and not terminated in one cell
does not propagate to the next one).
<P>
RTF keywords \background and \shpinst needed to be marked as IGNORABLE, so
that the destination gets ignored for plain text processing when in the
encapsulated range.
<P>
Now we have better codepage detection.  In ambiguous cases (when the
character fits into multiple codepages),we use the non-Western one.
Specifically, if you compose a message using a non-Western character set on
a machine set to the Western locale, we will use that character set even if
the first
nternational character encountered fits into Western codepage.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0.
<P>
This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on obtaining the
Service Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge
