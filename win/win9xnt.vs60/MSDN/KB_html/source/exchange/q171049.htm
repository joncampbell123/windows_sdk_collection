The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you attempt to modify the E-mail address of a mailbox in the
Administrator program, you may get a pop-up dialog box with the following
error message:
<P>
<PRE>  System attendant is not responding. Please check if System attendant
  is running.
  The system attendant service may be paused, or the version is not fitting
  the version of exchange admin program.

</PRE>When you try to access the property pages of the Internet Mail Service, you
may get one of the following error messages:
<P>
<PRE>   - Extension SMTP could not be loaded. The MSExchangeSA service is not
      available. MS Exchange Admin ID No C1031668
     
   - Extension SMTP could not be loaded. An error occurred, file
      replication extension.dll file with the incorrect version number.

</PRE>You also may find one or both of the following error messages in the event
viewer:
<PRE>  
  - Error 1702 Error just occurred while writing delivery log information
     to the MSExchangeSA.

  - Internal MTA error occurred. Please contact MS Product Support
     Service. Unable to write the Message Tracking log.
    [BASE XFER-N 22 88](16)

</PRE>When you check Control Panel\Services, the system attendant (SA) is shown
as still running. If you stop the Exchange Administrator program and check
the system attendant service again, you discover that the SA service has
stopped. If you try to start the system attendant, it starts fine.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem usually happens after you apply Service Pack 1 to Exchange
Server 5.0. The application of the service pack may have failed or was
interrupted. While this problem exists, other functions of Exchange Server
seem to be working.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Perform the following steps to fix this problem:

<OL><P><LI>Disable or remove any third-party applications such as Norton PC
   Anywhere32 or Netscape Communicator.

<P><LI>Confirm that the Exchange Server computer has enough free disk space,
   and there are no interrupt request (IRQ) conflicts.

<P><LI>In Control Panel \ Services, select the system attendant service and
   click the Startup button. Verify the correct Startup service account,
   delete and re-type the password, and confirm the password.

<P><LI>Increase the diagnostic logging on the directory, the information store,
   and the MTA Exchange services.

<P><LI>Confirm that there is no corruption in the following registry key:
<P>
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeSA
<P>
   You confirm this by comparing the Exchange Server computer that is
   having the problem with the registry of another Exchange Server 5.0
   computer that is working properly.

<P><LI>Stop all the Exchange services and the Exchange Administrator program.

<P><LI>Reapply Exchange Server 5.0 Service Pack 1. If the Service Pack fails
   again, perform step 8; otherwise go to step 9.

<P><LI>Expand the SP1 files on another computer, and then copy them over the
   existing files in the c:\exchsrvr\bin and c:\exchsrvr\addins directories
   of the Exchange Server computer that is having the problem.

<P><LI>If you get sharing violations, confirm that the c:\exchsrvr is shared
   and the group Everyone has full control. Stop sharing the root folders
   of drive C:\ and drive D:\, and then click the Apply button. Share these
   two folders again, and click Apply again. For some reason, and in at
   least one case, this stopping and restarting of the sharing seems to
   avoid this sharing violation error message.

<P><LI>Run the SP1 update again, and then confirm that the registry key
   mentioned above was updated successfully.

<P><LI>Change the Startup of all the Exchange services to automatic and
   restart the Exchange Server computer.

<P><LI>Verify that the problem is fixed by starting the Exchange Administrator
   program and confirming that you can modify the E-mail address of one
   mailbox successfully.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Step number 9 above might fail with a different error message. The
following error message may be received:
<P>
<PRE>     There was an internal error and one of the windows you have been
     using have been closed. CsetupWebCon.ins file could not be found
     at or near line 19. Reboot your exchange server.

</PRE></OL>If you receive this error message, ignore it and continue the workaround
steps as mentioned above.
