<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Exchange Message Transfer Agent (MTA) terminates with an
Event ID 9405 and the following sequence of events appears in the Event
Log:
<P>
<PRE>   Event ID 2037  An internal MTA error occurred. There is a negative
   connection count for locality 52. [BASE KERNEL 6 117] (10)

   Event ID 2197  An MTA database server error was encountered while
   locking a queue. Called from XAPI. Procedure 131. Database error code:
   ODXOINIU - Object does not exist. Queue: 00000000. [DB Server TRANSFER
   28 84] (14)

   Event ID 2191  An MTA database server error was encountered while 
   adding an entry to a queue. Called from XAPI. Procedure 131. Database 
   error code: ODXOINIU - Object does not exist. Queue name: 00000000. 
   Object at fault: 060000EE. [DB Server TRANSFER 28 62] (14)

   Event ID 2198  An MTA database server error was encountered while
   unlocking a queue. Called from XAPI. Procedure 131. Database error 
   code: ODXOINIU - Object does not exist. Queue: 00000000. [DB Server 
   TRANSFER 28 127] (14)

   Event ID 3128  An MTA database server error was encountered. [XAPI
   TRANSFER 28 131] (14)

   Event ID 3120  A resource limit has been reached when attempting to 
   open an association. Number of sessions configured: 80. [XAPI MAIN BASE 
   1 91] (14)

   Event ID 9405  An unexpected error has occurred which may cause the MTA
   to terminate. Error: ExchHeapFree Failure. [BASE INCOMING RPC 193] (16)

   Event ID 9405 An unexpected error has occurred which may cause the MTA
   to terminate. Error: Exception e0020002 occurred at Address 77f3cbcd
   [BASE INCOMING RPC 193] (16)

</PRE>Note that in the example above, these events appear in the order in which
they occurred; they appear in this order if the Event Viewer is configured
to view the oldest events first.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The MTA terminated due to a resource shortage. The MTA is attempting to 
add local resources for remotely-hosted connectors such as the Internet 
Mail Connector (IMC) or the MS Mail Connector (MSMI).
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Change the following registry entry to 0x20 to avoid this resource
shortage:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services
                     \MSExchangeMTA\Parameters\MT gateway clients

</PRE>The default setting is 0x08 and is adequate under normal conditions.
However, when an installation has several gateways and connectors
configured, additional resources may be required.
