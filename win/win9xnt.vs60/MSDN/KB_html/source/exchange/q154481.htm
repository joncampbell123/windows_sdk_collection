<P><h3>1.0 Introduction</h3>
 
<P>
This release of Microsoft Exchange Server 5.0 Service Pack 1 (SP1) is easy
to apply from within Microsoft Windows NT and changes only those files that
were originally set up on the Microsoft Exchange Server system.
<P>
Important: Service Pack 1 requires that Microsoft Exchange Server 5.0 has
already been installed on the server or client workstation that you are
updating.
<P>

take 10 or more minutes to run because it must copy the cabinet files to
the local computer, extract the files, and then copy them to their correct
locations.
<P>
NOTE: To refresh the client installation point on your network so that it
contains the latest fixes and prevents new users from having to run Update
immediately after they run Setup, please see the following article in the

<P>
<PRE>   Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3
   Active Server Pages 1.0b (distributed in Windows NT 4.0 SP3)

</PRE></OL><h3>3.2 Chinese Language Preferences</h3>
 
<P>
Web browsers can request Chinese Traditional (zh-tw) or Chinese Simplified
(zh-cn). Some browsers do not differentiate between Chinese Traditional and
Chinese Simplified when reporting their language preference to the server.
In cases where the browser does not specify a sublanguage, the most
recently installed language pack will be the default. You can control what
language will be returned in these cases by the order of installation of
your Chinese language packs.
<P>
<P><h3>3.3 Anonymous Access</h3>
 
<P>
Anonymous access is not available to folders hosted on servers running
Windows NT Server 3.51. To support anonymous folder access, the folders
must be hosted on a server running Windows NT 4.0.
<P>
<P><h3>3.4 Attachment Upload Requirements</h3>
 
<P>
When using Microsoft Internet Explorer for Windows 95 or Windows NT, you
must update to Internet Explorer 3.02 with the File Upload add-on to add
attachments to a message. At the time of the SP1 release, this add-on was
not available for the Windows 3.x platforms.
<P>
<P><h3>4.0 User Notes</h3>
 
<P>
<P><h3>4.1 Using Multiple Offline Address Books in the Administrator Program</h3>
 
<P>
Administrators can configure offline Address Books that remote users can
use to obtain information about other users in their organization. When
connecting remotely to a Microsoft Exchange Server computer, a user can
download an offline Address Book containing a list of recipients the
administrator specifies. Offline Address Books are stored in hidden public
folders.
<P>
Remote users typically send messages to a regular group of addresses and
require a subset of the global address list (GAL) rather than the entire
GAL for their organization. For example, members of a marketing group may
need the addresses of the complete marketing and sales groups, but not the
entire set of engineering group addresses.
<P>
The Offline Address Book property page on the DS Site Configuration object
has been enhanced to allow generation and manipulation of multiple offline
Address Books.
<P>
Defining Offline Address Book Properties
<P>
Use the Offline Address Book property page to set up multiple offline
Address Books.

<OL><P><LI>In the Administrator window, choose Configuration, and then double-click
   DS Site Configuration.

<P><LI>Select the Offline Address Book tab.

<P><LI>In the Offline Address Book Server box, select one of the servers in
   your site.
<P>
</OL>IMPORTANT: You must select a server running Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0 and Service Pack 1.

<OL><P><LI>To add containers for more offline Address Books, click Add.
<P>
</OL>-or-
<P>
<PRE>   To remove offline Address Book containers, select a container, and then
   click Remove.

</PRE></OL>5.To generate offline Address Books, click Generate All.
<P>
The following options appear in the Offline Address Book property page:

<UL><LI>Offfline Address Book Serve: The name of the server where you want to
   generate the offline Address Book.

<LI>Address Books: Displays a list of Address Books to be generated for the
   site being administered.

<LI>Add: Displays a list of containers that can be added to the list of
   offline Address Books.

<LI>Remove: Removes the selected offline Address Book from the list.

<LI>Generate All: Generates all displayed offline Address Books immediately.
<P>
</UL><h3>4.2 Using Multiple Offline Address Books in the Client</h3>
 
<P>
Multiple offline Address Books require Microsoft Exchange Server 5.0 SP1 or
later and either Microsoft Exchange Client 5.0 SP1 or Outlook 8.02. When
the feature is enabled on the server and a user tries to download an
offline Address Book as in previous versions of Microsoft Exchange, the
user will be prompted with a dialog box that lists all available Address
Books. The user can select one of these Address Books.
<P>
<P><h3>4.3 Windows File Types List for Microsoft Exchange Client for Macintosh</h3>
 
<P>
This feature improves interoperability between the Microsoft Exchange
Macintosh client and other e-mail clients. Under some circumstances, the
Microsoft Exchange Macintosh client sends and receives e-mail by using only
the data fork of the message. A new entry in the preferences file (named
Windows File Types) lists file types for which the Microsoft Exchange
Macintosh client will use only the data fork of the message.
<P>
Types of Entries
There are two types of entries:

<UL><LI>General extensions
<LI>Specific extensions for creator and type
<P>
</UL>General Extensions
<P>
Users can add an entry of the form:
<P>
<PRE>   EXT [Number]= .[Extension]

</PRE>All files that have this extension will be inserted in subsequent messages
as a data fork-only attachment. The default types are HTML, GIF, PDF, and
JPEG.
<P>
Specific Extensions for Creator and Type
<P>
Users can add an entry of the form:
<P>
<PRE>   :[CREATOR]:[TYPE]= .[Extension]

</PRE>All files that have the specified creator and type will be inserted as a
data fork-only attachment. The extension will be added to the end of the
file name, unless it is already present.
<P>
<P><h3>4.4 Microsoft Exchange White Papers</h3>
 
<P>
Downloading the Exchange Whitepapers

<OL><P><LI>Create the subdirectory WPapers on your local hard disk drive.

<P><LI>Download the file SP1_50WH.EXE located in the Server subdirectory to
   your WPapers subdirectory.

<P><LI>At the Windows NT command prompt, switch to the WPapers directory and
   type SP1_50WH followed by a -d to ensure that the correct directories
   are created. (Example: SP1_50WH -d).
<P>
</OL>The following Microsoft Exchange white papers have been included as a
convenience to you and can be found in the \\Support\Whiteppr directory.
These documents can be viewed with Microsoft Word for Windows 95 or
