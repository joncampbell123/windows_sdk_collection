<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server versions 4.0 and 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you use the directory import process to create distribution lists (DLs),
you may encounter a problem if you use recipients from sub-containers to
populate the DLs. The import process completes without any errors, but the
DL does not work properly.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
versions 4.0 and 5.0. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If you use the directory import process to create distribution lists, you
have to make sure to use the correct distinguished name (DN) in the Members
column of the Import file. If you have recipients in sub-containers, but
you do not include both the top-level container and the sub-container in
the distinguished name for recipients in sub-containers, the import will
complete with no errors, but the distribution list will not work properly.
<P>
For example, say you have the recipient container "Recipients" and a sub-
container of "Recipients" called "Other". The "Other" sub-container
contains non-Exchange recipients.
<P>
You then create an import file in order to create a distribution list to
send to some of the "Other" recipients. Call these "User1" and "User2".
The distribution list is called "Users".
<P>
The following mock import file shows the incorrect way to create the
import file for this example:
<P>
<PRE>   Obj-Class Display Name Alias Name Directory Name Members
   --------- ------------ ---------- -------------- -------
   DL        Users        Users      Users          Other/cn=User1
   DL        Users        Users      Users          Other/cn=User2

</PRE>After importing this file, you would receive no errors, and the
distribution list would get created. However, the distribution list would
not work because the names in the list cannot be resolved. Notice the
Members column only specifies the Other container and not its
parent container, so when Exchange tries to resolve the names in the list,
it fails.
<P>
Here is the same import file with the correct information in it for this
example:
<P>
<PRE>   Obj-Class Display Name Alias Name Directory Name Members
   --------- ------------ ---------- -------------- -------
   DL        Users        Users      Users
   Recipients/cn=Other/cn=User1
   DL        Users        Users      Users
   Recipients/cn=Other/cn=User2

</PRE>After performing an import using this file, the distribution list will be
created and it will work properly. Again, notice the Members column
has the parent container (Recipients) and the sub-container (Other) in the
DN for each recipient in the list.
<P>
NOTE: If you have already created a faulty distribution list, you will need
to use the Overwrite option when re-importing the list with the correct
format, or you can delete the distribution list and re-import it using the
correct format. Using the "Overwrite" option may not work in the desired
fashion depending on how your import file is formatted.
