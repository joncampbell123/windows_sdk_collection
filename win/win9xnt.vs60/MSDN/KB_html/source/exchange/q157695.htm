<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If Microsoft Exchange is configured to use a sub address, it can't
communicate with another Microsoft Exchange Message Transfer Agent (MTA) or
any other MTA through the French X.25 network (Transpac). When Microsoft
Exchange accepts an X.25 call, it sends back a Call Accept packet with its
own X.121 address.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The CCITT X.25 1988 recommendations state that there are two formats for
this packet: Basic and Extended. If the Extended format is used, an Address
block is optional and Microsoft Exchange will operate successfully.
However, the French X.25 network uses the Basic format. The problem occurs
since the French X.25 network automatically adds the local DTE address. The
only time that this problem occurs is when you use a sub address.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Exchange fails to communicate over X.25 in France. The Extended
format is only used if a specific complementary service is required. The
Address block is only used if Call Forwarding is active. Since this service
is not requested and the Address block is non zero, the X.25 network clears
the communication with an error code of 4A which translates into Longer of
Address non zero.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange
Service Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):
