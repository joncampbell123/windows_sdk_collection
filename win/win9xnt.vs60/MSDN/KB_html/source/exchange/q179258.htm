<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you are planning an upgrade from Microsoft Exchange Server version 4.0
or 5.0 to Exchange Server version 5.5, many factors must be taken into
consideration. This article emphasizes some of the more common points found
in this transition. The following list does not contain all the factors
that you may want to consider; however, it can be used as a guideline to
help you evaluate your decision to upgrade to Exchange Server 5.5.
<P>
The Exchange 5.5 Administrator program can be used to administer Exchange
Server 4.0 and 5.0 so that the upgrade process may be performed one server
at a time.
<P>
Before you upgrade to Exchange Server 5.5, review the readme document
located on the root directory of the Exchange Server 5.5 CD. Also, be sure
to make a complete backup of your existing Exchange Server computer before
beginning the installation process.
<P>
Things to consider when you upgrade to Exchange Server 5.5:

<OL><P><LI>Upgrade time: The time required to upgrade to Exchange Server 5.5 from
   Exchange Server 4.0 is approximately twice as long as the time required
   to upgrade a similar server from Exchange Server 5.0 to Exchange Server
   5.5.

<P><LI>The number of messages, the number of folders, and the total size of the
   message database determine the amount of time required to upgrade. You
   can reduce the upgrade time by having users reduce the amount of mail
   they keep on the server.

<P><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 can coexist in the same site with Exchange
   Server 4.0 or 5.0. You can take advantage of this compatibility to
   minimize downtime and spread out the upgrade process by bringing up a
   new Exchange Server 5.5 computer in the same site. This approach is
   useful for upgrading mailbox servers. If the server also hosts public
   folder data, see "Replicating Public Folders," in the Exchange Server
   5.5 readme document for more information. If you are introducing new
   hardware components to support large information stores or clustering,
   moving mailboxes can significantly decrease the time required to migrate
   to Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5.

<P><LI>The key differences between Exchange Server 5.0 and Exchange Server 5.5:
   Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 builds on the success of Exchange Server
   5.0 as a robust messaging and collaboration platform. The new version
   provides greater scalability and turnkey connectivity with more systems,
   including Notes, PROFS, and SNADS. New features enable a wide range of
   collaborative solutions from departmental workflow to cross-divisional
   line-of-business applications. Management is made easier through the
   addition of customer requested administrative features such as deleted
   item recovery. Exchange Server 5.5 also adds support for additional
   Internet protocols, such as IMAP4 and LDAPv3, and improves support for
   mobile users. Full details on new features may be found at the following
   Web address:
   
<P><PRE>      <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/exchange/guide/evaluate/revguide.asp">http://www.microsoft.com/exchange/guide/evaluate/revguide.asp.</A></B>
</PRE>
<P><LI>Internet Information Server (IIS) 3.0 is supported in both the 5.0 and
   5.5 releases of Exchange Server; however, support for IIS 4.0 will only
   be available in the Exchange Server 5.5 release. If you plan to use IIS
   4.0 for Outlook Web Access components, you will need to install Exchange
   Server 5.5 on that server (all other servers can still use Exchange
   Server 5.0).

<P><LI>Exchange Server 5.5 only ships with Outlook clients (Windows 3.x,
   Windows 95, Windows NT, and Macintosh versions). The 4.0 and 5.0
   Exchange clients can still be used to connect to an Exchange Server 5.5
   computer, but there will not be an Exchange 5.5 client.

<P><LI>Exchange Server 5.5 setup offers Exchange Server 5.0 users two upgrade
   options: an "In Place" upgrade and a "Fault Tolerant" upgrade.
<P>
   An "In place" upgrade upgrades the Exchange 5.0 database to the new Jet
<PRE>   '97 format in its current location. If the database upgrade process
   fails, the database may be rendered useless and a restore will need to
   be done before the upgrade can proceed again. A full backup of the
   databases is recommended before beginning the upgrade process.

   A "Fault Tolerant" upgrade upgrades the database in a specified
   temporary location. When the upgrade procedure is finished on all three
   databases, it copies the newly upgraded databases to the old database
   location.

</PRE><P><LI>Differences between the Standard and Enterprise Editions: Microsoft
   Exchange Server 5.5 Enterprise Edition is designed for organizations
   that require the highest levels of scalability, interoperability, and
   availability. The Enterprise Edition includes all of the features of the
   Standard Edition plus an unlimited data store (constrained only by the
   server hardware capacity), e-mail connectivity with IBM, PROFS, and
   SNADS messaging systems, X.400 connectivity, and support for Microsoft
   Cluster Server. These features extend the core functionality of the
   Standard Edition, such as built in SMTP support to yield the most
   comprehensive single product solution for corporate communication and
   collaboration.

<P><LI>Windows NT Server 4.0 Service Pack 3 is required to install Microsoft
   Exchange Server. It is strongly recommended that you upgrade your
   Microsoft Exchange Server computer to Windows NT Service Pack 4 when it
   is available. Until that time, you should install the hot fixes that are
   currently available from:
<PRE>        
   <B><A href="ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/winnt/winnt-">ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/winnt/winnt-</A></B>
   public/fixes/usa/nt40/hotfixes-postsp3/roll-up/

   If you are using Microsoft Exchange Server in a clustering environment,
   these hot fixes are required. If you install Microsoft Outlook Web
   Access on your Microsoft Exchange Server computer, these hot fixes are
   strongly recommended.

</PRE><P><LI>Before you run the Exchange Server 5.5 setup, shut down all monitors,
<P><PRE>    including Event Viewer, Performance Monitor, Server Monitor, and Link
    Monitor.
</PRE>
<P><LI>When you install Outlook Web Access, you should install the Windows NT
   hot fix that addresses problems with Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and
   memory leaks. For more information, see the Microsoft Knowledge Base on
   the Microsoft Product Support Services Web site:
<P>
<P><PRE>      <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/support">http://www.microsoft.com/support</A></B>
</PRE><P>
   You can download the hot fix from:
<P>
<P><PRE>      <B><A href="ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/iis/iis-public/fixes/usa/asp/asp-memfix/">ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/iis/iis-public/fixes/usa/ASP/asp-memfix/</A></B> 
</PRE><P>
   The self-extracting zip file is called Asp-memfix.exe. For more
   information, see the Microsoft Knowledge Base articles, <B><A href="../exchange/q176245.htm">Q176245</A></B> XWEB:
   VBScript Error when Accessing Outlook Web Access Server and <B><A href="../exchange/q176246.htm">Q176246</A></B>
   XWEB: Unexpected Behavior when Accessing Outlook Web Access.

<P><LI>If you install Microsoft Outlook version 8.03 on a Microsoft Exchange
   Server 5.5 computer, Outlook Web Access does not perform as expected.
   To solve this problem, run Regsvr32a.exe after you install Outlook.
   This utility resets the affected registry settings by reregistering
   Cdo.dll. You can download Regsvr32a.exe from the Microsoft web site at:
<P>
<P><PRE>       <B><A href="http://premium.microsoft.com/support/downloads/dp2439.asp">http://premium.microsoft.com/support/downloads/dp2439.asp</A></B>
</PRE><P>
   Run Regsvr32.exe from the command line using the full path to Cdo.dll
   as the argument. For example, the following command changes the
   registry settings by re-registering Cdo.dll:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Regsvr32.exe &lt;systemroot&gt;\system32\cdo.dll (where &lt;systemroot&gt; is
      your Windows NT directory)
</PRE><P>
   For more information, see the Microsoft Knowledge Base article, <B><A href="../exchange/q176744.htm">Q176744</A></B>
   XCLN: Installing Outlook on OWA Server Causes Access Failure.

<P><LI>If you need to run Internet Explorer 4.0 and Microsoft Exchange Server
   on the same computer, it is strongly recommended that you install
   Internet Explorer 4.0 before you install Microsoft Exchange Server. If
   you install Internet Explorer 4.0 after installing Microsoft Exchange
   Server, Internet Explorer modifies the MIME registry database,
   resulting in problems for international mail, especially mail with
   double-byte character content.

<P><LI>Database files cannot reside on a Distributed File System (DFS)
   partition because some Windows NT Server functionality used by
   Microsoft Exchange Server does not support DFS partitions. If you
   locate database files on a DFS partition, services will fail to start
   and will generate a 1022 (JET_errDiskIO) error message. This problem
   will be addressed in a future release of Windows NT Server.

<P><LI>You cannot run Microsoft Exchange Server setup in recovery mode (setup
   /R) with a batch mode .ini file. If you attempt to run setup /R /Q
   inifile_name, Setup ignores the /R command.

<P><LI>If you install or upgrade Microsoft Exchange Server on a computer that
   already has the Chat Service installed, you must stop the Chat Service
   before running Microsoft Exchange Server setup.

<P><LI>After you upgrade from Exchange Server 5.0, the first time the message
   transfer agent (MTA) is started the MTA database files
   (mtadata\db*.dat) are migrated to Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5
   format. This results in several warning events regarding integrity
   verification, including warnings 2219, 2206, and 2207. This is
   expected; you can ignore these warnings.

<P><LI>To start or stop Microsoft Exchange Server services on a clustered
   server, you must use the Cluster Administrator program. Using the
   Services application in Control Panel to start or stop Microsoft
   Exchange Server services can result in unpredictable behavior,
   including initiating failover of these services.

<P><LI>The maximum number of characters allowed in Windows NT user accounts is
   twenty. Therefore, if you use the Microsoft Exchange Server
   Administrator program to create a Windows NT user account at the same
   time you are creating a mailbox, the e-mail alias for the mailbox
   cannot be longer than twenty characters. For double-byte languages, the
   e-mail alias is limited to ten characters because each character takes
   up two conventional characters.
