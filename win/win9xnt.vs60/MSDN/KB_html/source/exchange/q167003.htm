The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Active Server components, version 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Internet Information Server, version 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Exchange Active Server Components interact with multiple
applications, including Windows NT, Internet Information Server (IIS),
Microsoft Exchange, and a browser (for example, Internet Explorer) The
first objective in troubleshooting problems with Active Server Components
is to determine what is causing problems.
<P>
This article assumes the following setup:
<P>
<PRE>   Computer running Microsoft Exchange Server and IIS with a
   Server Name = "XServer" (this can be two different computers)
   Domain = "XDom"
   Client Computer (Windows 95) = "client1"
   Microsoft Exchange mailbox name = "test1"
   Primary Windows NT Account = "NTTest1"
   Password= "Pass1"

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Remember the following throughout troubleshooting:

<UL><LI>When prompted with the authentication (logon) dialog box, enter
   the information in the following manner:
<P>
<PRE>      Username:     &lt;DomainName&gt;\&lt;DomainUsername&gt;

</PRE></UL>NOTE: This must be a backslash, NOT a forward slash.
<P>
<PRE>      Password:     &lt;DomainPassword&gt;

</PRE>NOTE: The Password field is case-sensitive.
<P>
<PRE>   Only entering the username will work in some cases (for instance, if you
   have already logged on to the Microsoft Exchange domain from the
   operating system).

</PRE><LI>In the logon.asp page, you must enter the mailbox name (alias name)
   exactly as it appears from the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator
   program. Display names are not accepted.

<LI>Whenever ANY changes are made on the computer running IIS or Microsoft
   Exchange Server, stop and restart the World Wide Web Publishing Service
   on the server and completely close the browser and restart it on the
   client computer  before testing again. Some information may be cached
   and this can lead to inconsistent results.

<LI>Review the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article prior to
   troubleshooting:
<P>
   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../exchange/q167002.htm">Q167002</A></B>
<PRE>   TITLE     : XWEB: Limitations of the Active Server Components

</PRE></UL><h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
 
<P>
The following questions will help you troubleshoot the Active Server
Components:

<OL><P><LI>Can the "test1" mailbox be accessed from any non web-based Microsoft
   Exchange clients running on this computer? To determine this:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - From "client1," attempt to log on to "mailbox1" using Microsoft
      Exchange Client 4.0 or 5.0, a POP3 client (if Microsoft Exchange 5.0)
      or Outlook).
</PRE><P>
</OL>If the answer is no, troubleshoot this as a normal client/server issue.

<UL><LI>Try creating a brand new Microsoft Exchange mailbox and Windows NT
   account, set up a new Microsoft Exchange profile on the client computer,
   and attempt to connect.

<LI>If you can connect, continue.

</UL><OL><P><LI>Can this browser attach to ANY other web sites?
<P>
<P><PRE>    - If the answer is no, this is likely a browser-specific issue; contact
      the manufacturer of the browser for assistance.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - If the answer is yes, continue.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Can the browser access the IIS default Web page at <B>http://Nserver</B>
   (where Nserver is the IIS computer with the Exchange Active Server
<P><PRE>    Components installed)?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - If the answer is no, this is an IIS issue. Contact Microsoft
      Technical Support for assistance.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - If the answer is yes, continue.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Can the browser access the ASP Sample Pages at <B>http://Nserver/aspsamp</B>
   (where Nserver is the IIS computer with the Microsoft Exchange Active
   Server Components installed)?
<P>
   - If the answer is no, this is an IIS issue. Contact Microsoft Technical
<P><PRE>     Support for assistance.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - If the answer is yes, continue.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Are the Sample Active Server scripts that ship with Microsoft Exchange
   Server being used?
<P>
<P><PRE>    - If the answer is yes, contact Microsoft Technical Support for
      assistance.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - If the answer is no, contact Developer support for assistance with
      custom ASPs. Test the sample active server scripts that ship with
      Microsoft Exchange Server. If necessary, rename the current Webdata
      directory and copy a new one from the Microsoft Exchange Server
      compact disc to test).
</PRE>
<P><LI>Set up IIS to use "Clear Text" Only in Internet Service Manager
   (Service Properties for WWW service). Disable "Windows NT
   Challenge/Response" if enabled.
<P>
   Stop and restart the "World Wide Web Publishing Service" after making
   any changes

<P><LI>Attempt to connect to another computer running IIS and Microsoft
   Exchange Server
<P>
</OL>There is a test server normally available on Microsoft's Web site. See
<B><A href="http://www.exchangeserver.com/testdrive/instruct.htm">http://www.exchangeserver.com/testdrive/instruct.htm</A></B> for instructions
The location for the test-drive server is
<B>http://exchinet.exchangeserver.com/exchange.</B>

<OL><P><LI>Create a brand new mailbox and brand new Windows NT account for testing.

<P><LI>Clear the browser cache for Internet Explorer:
<P>
   a. On the View menu, click Options.
<P>
   b. On the Advanced tab, click Emtpy Folder.

<P><LI>If using a proxy server and attempting to use NTLM, you MUST select the
   option Do Not Use Proxy Server For Local (Intranet) Addresses (this is
   located on the Properties for IE Connection tab).
