The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, version 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Exchange Windows 95 client, version 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, version 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you attempt to read the contents of a public folder from a Web Browser 
with anonymous access via the Microsoft Exchange Active Server Components, 
the following error may occur:
<P>
<PRE>   Unable to get published folder list.

</PRE>This error can occur if anonymous folder access is not configured correctly.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Verify that the following are true.

<OL><P><LI>Verify that the IIS server's WWW service is running and handling ASP 
   requests. This can be done by running some of the sample scripts available 
   with IIS. 
<P>
</OL>NOTE: Anonymous access from the WWW service properties is not required for 
<PRE>      anonymous access to Microsoft Exchange Public Folders.

</PRE><P><LI>From the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program, confirm that the HTTP 
   protocol is enabled and allows for anonymous access to public folders.
   you can do this by expanding the Site container, configuration container, 
   protocols container, opening the HTTP protocol properties page, and 
   clicking on the General tab.

<P><LI>From the HTTP protocol properties page, select the Folder Shortcuts tab. 
   Verify that the folder(s) for anonymous access are available in the 
   Public Folder Shortcuts listbox.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: Including only the Public Folder folder tree object will not provide 
<PRE>      anonymous access to any of the top level Public Folders. 

</PRE><P><LI>Verify that the folder has access permissions. On the Public Folder 
   Shortcuts tab, click the Client Permissions button. Make sure that the 
   default permissions for the anonymous account are set to a minimum of
   Reviewer.

<P><LI>Verify that the Public Folder(s) you are trying to open is available from 
   the Microsoft Exchange client (most likely, from a LAN or WAN connection). 
   This should ensure that the public folder is accessible.

<P><LI>If you are still having problems, setup a test folder and add it to the 
   list of folders and assign the appropriate permissions. Remember to exit
   the Browser and restart it before attempting to access the test public 
   folder.

<P><LI>Make sure that the IUSR_SERVER account (whether PDC, BDC, or Member Server)
   has log on locally rights on the IIS Server.

<P><LI>Make sure that the IUSR_SERVER account's password in the Windows NT User 
   Manager is the same as in the Internet Service Manager.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: When accessing the active server components for anonymous access, the
<PRE>      user should be presented with the Microsoft Exchange Logon ASP page 
      (Logon.asp).
