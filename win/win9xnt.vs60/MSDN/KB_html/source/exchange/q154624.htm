The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how to configure a site connector between two
Exchange sites when the Exchange SITES are in untrusted Windows NT
Domains. For demonstrative purposes the following terms will be 
used:
<P>
<PRE>   Domains D1 &amp; D2 are the two untrusted domains

   S1 and  S2 are the two Exchange sites.

</PRE>There are two different scenarios described below, with different
instructions for each.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Scenario 1: Exchange Server S1 resides in Domain D1 and you are planning
to install Exchange Server S2 in Domain D2.
<P>
Use the following steps in order to ensure proper operation of the Site
Connector:

<OL><P><LI>Find out what Windows NT service account was used during the
   installation of Exchange Server S1 in Domain D1. It can be found by
   looking at the Service Account Password tab on the Configuration
   Property page.

<P><LI>The account information for this account may be something like the
   following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Domain D1\Xservice with password of Password.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Create an account in Domain D2 called Domain D2\Xservice. In other
   words, create an account name in Domain D2 with exactly the same user
   name and password as the account in Domain D1.

<P><LI>Give this account "Access Computer from Network" user rights from the
   Windows NT User Manager on both Exchange Servers.

<P><LI>When installing Microsoft Exchange Server in Domain D2, use the
   account of Domain D2\Xservice with the identical password.

<P><LI>After the install process is complete, configure the site connector
   on both sites S1 and S2, using the account Xservice on the override
   property page.
<P>
</OL>Scenario 2:You already have installed Microsoft Exchange Servers in Sites
S1 and S2, in their respective Domains D1 and D2. The Exchange Service
Accounts used were different; for example, Xservice1 and Xservice2.
<P>
Use the following steps to configure the Site Connector:

<OL><P><LI>Create an account called Xservice with an identical password in both
   Domains D1 and D2.

<P><LI>Run the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program and assign the account
   created, that is, Xservice, the role of Service Account Administrator
   on both the Site and Configuration Container. This needs to be done on
   both the Exchange Servers.

<P><LI>Give the XService account "Access Computer from Network" user rights
   from the Windows NT User Manager on both Exchange Servers.

<P><LI>Log on to the server where the site connector is going to be configured
   as Xservice.

<P><LI>Configure the Site Connector and use the account created on the
   override property page. When asked to create the Site Connector for the
   other site, go ahead and do so.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: It is important to log on to the Exchange Server where the connector
is going to be created as the Xservice account. Otherwise the account will
need to be given access to the Local Administrators group which some
administrators may consider a security risk.
<P>
NOTE: When configuring a Site Connector on Microsoft Exchange Servers
between Untrusted domains, make sure at least one of the servers is a
Domain Controller. If one is a member server, you must configure the Site
Connector from the member server.
