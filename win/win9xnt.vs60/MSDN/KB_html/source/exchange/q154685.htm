The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
One of the following errors may be written to the Event Viewer Application
Log by the receiving MSExchangeMTA when a message is sent between Exchange
Sites using the SMTP Address of an Exchange user, rather than the X400/X500
Address:
<P>
<PRE>  Event ID 142: "Unable to route to c=us;a=
  ;p=SendingOrgName;o=SendingSitename;DDA:SMTP=user1@RecvOrg.RecvSite.com."

</PRE>OR
<P>
<PRE>   Event ID 290: "A non-delivery report (reason code unable to transfer
   and diagnostic code MTS-congestion) is being generated for message
   c=us;a= ;p=orgname;l=RecvMTAname-960808200654z1. It was originally
   destined for
   c=us;a=;p=orgname;o=SendSite;DDA:SMTP=alias@RecvSite.orgname.com; and
   was to be redirected to.[MTA DISP:RESULT 20 136]."

</PRE>A Non-Delivery Report (NDR) may also be delivered to the sender of the
message stating that the message did not reach some or all of the intended
recipients with one of the following reasons given:
<P>
<PRE>    - "Recipient name not found",

</PRE>OR
<P>
<PRE>    - "due to congestion in the message transfer service".

</PRE>The NDR is generated by the receiving MTA.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This error condition is caused by the receiving Exchange MTA's inability to
route a message addressed with an SMTP address to an Internet Mail
Connector for further resolution. This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
There are three methods to workaround this problem, depending on whether
there is replication between the sites.

<OL><P><LI>Whether replication has occurred or not, using the X400 Address instead
   of the SMTP address to send to users in other sites will work, because
   Exchange is a native X400 messaging system.

<P><LI>If replication has occurred between the sites and an IMC is available,
   the IMC can be configured (using the Email Domain . . . button on the
   Connections tab) to route all mail addressed to the various Exchange
   SMTP addresses (the SMTP addresses of users that actually have a mailbox
   on the Exchange system) will be forwarded directly back to the Exchange
   Server. In this case, the Address Space on the IMC should be SMTP and
   left blank. Once the message goes out the Internet Mail Connector and
   comes back in, it will be matched to an address in the Exchange
   directory and will be routed to the appropriate mailbox.

<P><LI>If replication has not occurred among the sites, then an IMC must be
   configured in each site with the Address Space configured as
   "*@localsite.organization.com", for example. The IMC must be configured,
   as in the second case, to forward all mail back to the Exchange Server
   itself.
<P>
</OL>The last two options above consume processing power and memory, and the
better solution would be to use X400 Addressing between sites if a user
must, for some reason, use a one-off address (or custom recipient) to send
to another Exchange user.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Exchange Server is not designed to support messaging between Exchange users
on different sites using the Internet-style, or SMTP, addresses. Each time
a message is sent that is addressed with an SMTP address, the MTA looks for
a valid route for that recipient in the Routing Table (that is, the Gateway
Address Routing Table, or GWART). If a route is found to another site
through one of the site connectors (Site Connector, Dynamic RAS Connector,
or X400 Connector), the MTA will successfully hand off that message to the
MTA in the other site. However, if the receiving MTA cannot find another
valid SMTP address space in its GWART to forward that message to, then it
will generate this error condition.
