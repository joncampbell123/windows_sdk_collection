The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After you open a message with an attachment using the Microsoft Exchange 16-
bit Windows client under Windows 3.1 or Windows for Workgroups 3.x, the
following error will occur when you try to open the attachment:
<P>
<PRE>   \\Servername\sharename\filename.ext does not exist

</PRE>The same attachment can be opened by other users at different computers.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This error will occur if the attachment in the message is linked to a file
that is on a share local to the user who sent the message. The redirector
in Windows 3.1 and WFWG 3.x cannot use UNC pathnames to local shares.
<P>
For example, User1 is at a machine called USER1. A message is sent to User1
or placed in a public folder that is linked to the file Test.txt, which is
located on \\USER1\Share. When User1 tries to open the attachment, the
above error will occur. However another user at a computer named USER2 will
be able to open the attachment.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This problem only occurs when sending linked attachments. Embedded
attachments do not point back to the shares from which they came. In the
above example, User1 would be able open the embedded attachment even though
the file originated on the USER1 share.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Windows 95 and Windows NT workstations do not have the same redirector
limitation that Win 3.1 and WFWG 3.x have. So if a linked attachment is
needed by all members of the organization, using Windows 95 or Windows NT
would be the preferred method.
