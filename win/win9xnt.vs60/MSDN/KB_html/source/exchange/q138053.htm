<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you send mail to the Internet from a Microsoft Exchange Windows or 
Outlook client, an file attachment called WINMAIL.DAT may be added to the 
message. This attachment contains Microsoft Exchange rich-text information
for the message being sent. The WINMAIL.DAT file may not be useful to 
non-Microsoft Exchange recipients. The information in the WINMAIL.DAT file 
may appear on the receiving end as binary information at the end of the 
mail message.
<P>
This article describes how to prevent sending the WINMAIL.DAT attachment to
Internet users when you are using the Microsoft Exchange Internet Mail
Connector (IMC).
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
You can control whether or not to send rich-text format in any one of the
following ways:

<OL><P><LI>Creating Custom Recipients
   When the administrator creates a custom recipient using the Microsoft
   Exchange Administrator program, clear the "Always Send To This Recipient
   In Microsoft Exchange Rich-Text Format" check box.

<P><LI>Modifying Existing Microsoft Exchange and Custom Recipients
   The administrator can modify an existing user account (Microsoft
   Exchange user or custom recipient) to not send rich-text format
   information, by clearing the MAPI Recipient check box in the Advanced
   property page of the recipient's properties. You can view the
   recipient's properties by selecting the recipient name and then choosing
   Properties from the File menu.

<P><LI>Addresses in the Personal Address Book
   The user can modify the Internet addresses in a their personal address
   book not to send rich-text information by clearing the "Always Send To
   This Recipient In Microsoft Exchange Rich-Text Format" check box in the
   SMTP - Address property page of the Internet address in the PAB. To
   obtain the properties of an entry in a PAB, select the entry and choose
   Properties from the File menu.

<P><LI>Configuring the Internet Mail Connector (IMC)
   The administrator can configure the IMC to send or not to send rich-text
   information by following the steps below:
<P>
   a. Bring up the properties of the Internet Mail Connector.
<P>
   b. Select the General property page.
<P>
<P><PRE>      The Send Microsoft Exchange Rich Text list box controls the sending
      of rich-text data. There are three values to choose from:
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       - If the value is set to User, the recipient properties are used to
<PRE></PRE>         determine whether or not to send rich-text information.

       - If the value is set to Always, rich-text information is always
         sent, regardless of the recipient properties.

       - If the value is set to Never, rich-text information is never sent.

   You can also configure whether or not to send rich-text information on
   a per-domain basis. To define e-mail domains and the message settings
   for that domain, click the E-Mail Domain button.

</PRE><P><LI>One-Off Addressing
   You can send e-mail to an Internet user from an Exchange or Outlook 
   client, using One-Off addressing. One-Off addressing allows sending a 
   message to addresses that are not in the Personal Address Book, the 
   Global Address List, or in any recipient containers.
<P>
   Depending on the type of the One-Off address used, rich-text information
   is or is not sent with the message:
<P>
   a. Rich-Text Information Sent:
<P>
<P><PRE>      If the One-Off address has the following format, rich-text
      information is sent with the message:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>         [SMTP:&lt;SMTP Address&gt;]

      where SMTP Address is any valid SMTP address, for example:

         user@domain.com

      To verify that rich-text information is sent:

         1) Select the Check Names command from the Tools menu after typing
            the address in the above format.

            This should display the SMTP address without the "SMTP:." The
            name should be underlined.

         2) Bring up the Properties of the address by double clicking it.

            If the option "Always send to this recipient in Microsoft
            Exchange rich-text format" is checked indicating that rich-text
            information (the WINMAIL.DAT file) is sent along with the
            message.

   b. Rich-Text Information Not Sent:

      If you use a One-Off address and you do not want to send rich-text
      information to the recipient, the address should have the following
      format:

         &lt;SMTP Address&gt;

      where SMTP Address is any valid SMTP Address, for example:

         user@domain.com

   NOTE: Unlike the address in step 5.a. above, the SMTP Address is not
   proceeded by "SMTP:" and the address is not enclosed in square
   brackets.

   If you click the Check Names command and then get the properties of the
   address, you can see that the rich-text option is not selected.

   However, no matter what option is selected for the address of the
   recipient, the IMC settings determine whether or not rich-text
   information is transmitted. If the IMC is set to never send rich-text
   data, then even if the properties of the recipient address have the
   rich-text option selected, no rich-text is transmitted.

   If the IMC has separate settings for individual domains, then the
   settings for those domains takes precedence for all messages addressed
   to users in those domains.
