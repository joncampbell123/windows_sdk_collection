The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server, version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Windows NT Server computers that run User Manager for Domains and
also have the Microsoft Exchange Server 4.0 Administrator program
installed, may hang during shutdown.
<P>
During shutdown, you will notice a dialog box stating that User Manager
does not respond to the End Task request.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The User Manager extension for Microsoft Exchange Server fails to
deinitialize and terminate properly.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully
regression-tested and should be applied only to systems experiencing this
specific problem. Unless you are severely impacted by this specific
problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that
contains this fix. Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more
information.
We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program is installed on a Windows
NT computer, it installs an extension into User Manager for Domains. This
extension allows you to administer Windows NT Domain accounts and Microsoft
Exchange mailboxes from the same program.
