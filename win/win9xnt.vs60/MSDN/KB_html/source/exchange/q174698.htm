The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Microsoft Exchange Server version 4.0
 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The LinkAge Notes Directory Exchange Agent (DXA) will not process any
requests. It appears to initialize properly and does not do anything.
Requests from LinkAge Administrator's Process Manager to stop the process
do not take effect.
The LinkAge Notes DXA is stuck in the current activity "Processing Inbound
MIF Message," regardless of size of the update.
After you terminate the process through Windows NT 4.0 Task Manager
(Lsdxants.exe), within the next minute the log reveals the following (logs
are located in LINKAGE\LOGS directory):
<P>
<PRE>   1997/09/22 17:57:34- LDE(01a8) 4 10153:Subtask DXANOTES(lsdxants.exe)
   has ended with return code 1
   &gt;&gt; subtask(441)
   1997/09/22 17:57:34- LDE(01a8) 2 10157:Subtask DXANOTES generated the
   following messages:
   &gt;&gt; subtask(1031)
   1997/09/22 17:57:34- LDE(01a8) 2 10158: DXANOTES&gt; The ID file being used
   is: C:\notes_server\data\user.id
   &gt;&gt; subtask(1049)
   1997/09/22 17:57:34- LDE(01a8) 2 10158: DXANOTES&gt; Enter password (press
   the Esc key to abort):
   &gt;&gt; subtask(1049)

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The incorrect Lotus Notes ID file is being used in reference to the LinkAge
Notes Directory Exchange Agent (DXA). The LinkAge Notes DXA, similar to the
LinkAge Notes Connector, requires a Notes ID file with no password.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Check the [DXANOTES] section in the Linkage.ini file, located in the
   \LINKAGE directory. The parameter NOTESINI points to the location of the
   Notes.ini file that the LinkAge Notes DXA will use.

<P><LI>Start a Notes client pointing to the Notes.ini file (notes.exe
   =c:\notes\notes.ini).

<P><LI>Select the File menu, and then click Tools, and select User ID to verify
   which ID file is being used by the LinkAge Notes DXA.

<P><LI>Change the User ID to the proper Notes ID (should not have a password)
   by going to the File menu, clicking Tools, and selecting Switch ID.

<P><LI>If you receive one of the following pop-up messages:
<P>
<P><PRE>      The ID file is locked by another process. Try again later.
</PRE><P>
   -or-
<P>
<P><PRE>      Unable to open desktop file. Notes may have terminated abnormally in
      an earlier session. Please log off or shut down the operating system
      before running Notes again.
</PRE><P>
   you should stop the LinkAge controller service from Control Panel and
   ensure that no Lsdxants.exe, Lsntsmex.exe, Lsmexnts.exe, Notes.exe, or
   Nlnotes.exe processes are resident in memory. If so, terminate them
   using task manager and attempt another dirsync cycle.

<P><LI>If this fails, restart the computer.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
By default, LinkAge Message Exchange (LME) and the LinkAge Directory
Exchange (LDE) components connect to the same Notes server. Therefore, the
Notes.ini parameter in the LME-NOTES and DXANOTES section points to the
same Notes.ini file on the LinkAge computer. If the LDE component is
connecting to a different Notes server than the LME component, the
Notes.ini parameter in the DXANOTES section of the Linkage.ini file must
reflect this difference; otherwise, dirsync will not work. Check this
parameter first, and confirm that it is correct.
