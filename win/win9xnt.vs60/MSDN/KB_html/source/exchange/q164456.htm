The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Microsoft Exchange Server version 4.0
 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Users who are migrated to Exchange from Microsoft Mail postoffices may not
receive messages in their Exchange Inbox. This occurs when Microsoft Mail
users are addressing from any address list that is not updated by directory
synchronization (dirsync). This also occurs if Exchange users are
addressing the migrated user from a personal address book that has not been
updated from the Exchange global address list since the Microsoft Mail user
was migrated.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If Microsoft Mail users have been participating in dirsync and then are
migrated into Exchange, the users will receive two Microsoft Mail-type
addresses on their e-mail address tab. One Microsoft Mail address is their
new Exchange Network/Postoffice/Alias address, and the other is their
former Network/Postoffice/Alias address. The former address is to allow
other Microsoft Mail users to continue sending to the migrated users using
their old Network/Postoffice/Alias name. If the Exchange Microsoft Mail
Connector contains a definition for the migrated Network/Postoffice name,
the connector will reroute the message to the former postoffice. The
Microsoft Mail Connector will not forward the message into Exchange to
determine whether the address is in Exchange. If the Microsoft Mail
Connector no longer has the former postoffice's Network/Postoffice
definitions, then the Microsoft Mail Connector will forward the messages
into Exchange. Microsoft Mail users can continue to address from any
address list without being updated.
<P>
This problem is similar to moving one user to another postoffice. If the
global address lists and personal address books from the sending
postoffices still have that user listed as existing on the old postoffice,
the messages will be routed to that postoffice and then NDRed (non-delivery
reported).
<P>
Microsoft recommends that migrations of entire postoffices be performed
rather than migrations of individual users.
<P>
This behavior is by product design.
