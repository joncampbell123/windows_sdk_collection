<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The message transfer agent (MTA) may take a long time to start if there is
a large number of DB*.DAT files in the MTADATA directory when the service
is restarted. This is normal and expected behavior but is often
misinterpreted as a problem. Administrators often mistakenly believe that
the MTA is not responding and they complicate the issue by stopping the MTA
service.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When the MTA starts, up it has to rebuild the queues in memory. If there
are a lot of DAT files, this can take quite some time.
<P>
One quick check you can perform is to set the MTA's logging on Field
Engineering to Maximum and then monitor the 2166 and 2167 events for the
number of objects in each of the queues. There is no hard and fast rule,
but if you have 100,000 DAT files at startup, it is reasonable to expect
the queues to grow to at least that total size before assuming the MTA is
not responding.
