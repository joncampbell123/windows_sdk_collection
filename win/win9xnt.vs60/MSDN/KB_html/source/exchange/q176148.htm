<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When a message is sent to an invalid originator/recipient (O/R) address, a
non-delivery report (NDR) is generated, as expected. However, the NDR is
never delivered to the originator of the message.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When a message is sent to an invalid, manually entered X.400 O/R address
(referred to as an one-off routing address), the store uses Address.dll to
normalize the O/R address. The normalizing process consists of ordering the
attributes in the O/R address which is in the form of a string. This
ordering is important so that the address can be resolved to a DN (just
like for a X400 proxy). The message is submitted to the MTA. During message
submission to the MTA, the store checks the syntax but not the
"routability" of the message.
<P>
As expected this message will cause the remote MTA to generate an NDR. As
this NDR reaches the sender's store the same code path is taken for
entryid generation for the actual recipient name. The store now proceeds
to parse the NDR and encounters the attributes that refer to the actual
recipient of the original message. It fails to parse these and proceeds to
drop the NDR.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0.
This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on obtaining the
Service Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge
