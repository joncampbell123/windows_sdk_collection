The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
The following procedures allow you to update a Microsoft Exchange Server
5.0 client installation point with Microsoft Exchange Server Service Pack 1
binary files.
<P>
This allows new users to run the client Setup once and have all the fixes
in Service Pack 1 on their workstation. This also allows an existing
Microsoft Exchange Server 5.0 RTM user to run client Setup just once
(instead of twice) to update the workstation with all of the Service Pack 1
files.
<P>
These procedures are very detailed and require a lot of editing by the
system administrator. It is easy to make an editing mistake, so take your
time and double-check your changes. These procedures will work for all
client platforms and languages. Thorough testing is recommended before
making this installation point available to your users.
<P>
To update a Microsoft Exchange Server 5.0 Client installation point with
Microsoft Exchange Client Service Pack 1 binary files:

<OL><P><LI>Create a Microsoft Exchange Server 5.0 Client Administration share on
   your network by using the "setup /a" command. This provides all the
   binary files in expanded form and eliminates the CAB files. Name the
   directory Sp1.mod.

<P><LI>Run Setup Editor (if you have done so in the past) and do your normal
   modifications.

<P><LI>In a separate directory on your network, copy the contents of the
   Microsoft Exchange 5.0 SP1 client directory that matches the client you
   set up in Step 1. Name the directory Sp1.org.

<P><LI>Copy the Extract.exe and Sp1extrt.bat files from the Support directory
   of the Service Pack 1 compact disk to the Sp1.org directory. If you have
   downloaded Service Pack 1 from the Internet, and thus do not have the
   compact disk, these files can be found in Sp1_50wh.exe.

<P><LI>From the Sp1.org directory, run Sp1extrt.bat. This will create an
   \Sp1.org\Rawsp1 directory and will place all the extracted Service
   Pack 1 binary files there.

<P><LI>Using your favorite text editor (do not use Edit.com), open
   Sp1.mod\Exchng.inf and \Sp1.org\Rawsp1\Exchng.inf.

<P><LI>For each line listed under the [Client Files] section in
   Sp1.org\Rawsp1\Exchng.inf, make the corresponding date, size, and
   version changes in \Sp1.mod\Exchng.inf. If the file does not exist in
   Sp1.mod\Exchng.inf, skip it. Do not do a complete line copy; this will
   break Setup.
<P>
   VERY IMPORTANT! Only change the date, the size (if it changes), and the
   version. Be careful not to delete commas or additional fields.

<P><LI>After your modifications are complete, save it to its original location
   and close the text editor.

<P><LI>Replace the .dll files in \Sp1.mod\System with the corresponding .dll
   files in Sp1.org\Rawsp1.
<P>
</OL>You are now ready to test your client installation.
<P>
NOTE: Extract.exe is a Win16 utility.
