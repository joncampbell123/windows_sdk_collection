The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5
<LI>Microsoft Proxy Server, version 2.0
</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article explains how to configure Microsoft Exchange Server to operate
with Proxy Server 2.0 to handle incoming Internet client requests (this is
known as "reverse-hosting"). SMTP servers and POP clients on the Internet
must be configured to contact the Proxy Server computer through the
appropriate port in order to communicate with the Exchange Server computer.
<P>
In addition, versions of the Wspcfg.ini file need to be placed in the
directory where the server application's .exe files are installed. Because
Exchange Server has more than one .exe file, more than one Wspcfg.ini file
is needed in specific directories.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 

<OL><P><LI>Add the following section to the first Wspcfg.ini file. This section is
   required for the Exchange SMTP service:
<P>
<P><PRE>      [Msexcimc]
      ServerBindTcpPorts=25
      Persistent=1
      KillOldSession=1
</PRE>
<P><LI>Place this file in the directory where the Msexcimc.exe file is located.
   The default directory path is \exchsrvr\connect\msexcimc\bin.
</OL>3. Confirm that the SMTP port is bound to the Proxy Server computer's port
<PRE>   25.
</PRE></OL>4. The second Wspcfg.ini file contains entries needed for the Exchange
<PRE>   Store (Store.exe), as follows:

      [Store]
      ServerBindTcpPorts=110,119,143
      Persistent=1
      KillOldSession=1
   Additional ports can be listed in this because Store.exe sets POP mail
   on port 110, NNTP on port 119, and IMAP4 on port 143.

</PRE><P><LI>Place this second Wspcfg.ini file in the directory where Store.exe is
   located. The default directory path is \exchsrvr\bin.

<P><LI>Verify that your DNS MX records point to the Proxy Server computer and
   not to the Exchange Server computer. Because the MX record is different
   from the regular GetHostByName call, you must configure network TCP/IP
   properties, using Control Panel, to use DNS for the Exchange Server
   computer. The WinSock Proxy client application automatically redirects
   the DNS MX request.

<P><LI>Stop and restart the Exchange services, or restart the Exchange Server
   computer, for the new settings to take effect. You should be able to
   contact the Exchange Server computer by connecting to the Proxy Server
   computer's external IP address using SMTP, NNTP, or POP protocols.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: If you have an internal DNS server on your network, you can use DHCP
to configure the internal server. This will allow you to use both internal
and external DNS servers to resolve names on your internal network and on
the Internet.
<P>

Server, refer to the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article: <B><A href="../proxysvr/q176771.htm">Q176771</A></B>,
