The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it
if a problem occurs. For information on how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" online Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry
Key" online Help topic in Regedt32.exe.
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you access a Public Folder and the folder has an initial view that is
categorized, the operation may fail with the following error message seen
by the client:
<P>
<PRE>   Client Operation Failed

</PRE>If you press the F2 key while this error message is displayed, you will see
the following error codes:
<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft Exchange Server Information Store - 1201 - [80004005 -
   FFFFFBFE]

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When a categorized view is placed on a folder, each user that accesses it
creates two columns in the JET database (public or private information
store) for storing the collapsed state of the row. There is hard-coded
limit for the size of a JET record and the Information Store is surpassing
that limit, causing the error.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, do one of the following four workarounds:

<UL><LI>After you close the error messages, change the view to the Personal,
   Normal view.
<P>

<LI>Change the initial view on the folder to be normal or non-categorized.

<LI>Replicate the folder to more servers so fewer users will access the view
   on each replica.

<LI>Reset the cached views as shown below.
<P>
</UL>WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall Windows. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be
solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and
Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" online Help
topics in Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before
you edit it.

<OL><P><LI>Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe or Regedit.exe as appropriate for
   your version of Windows NT).

<P><LI>Go to the following key in the registry:
<P>
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeIS
   \ParametersPublic\

<P><LI>On the Edit menu, click Add Value and use the following entry:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Value Name: Reset Views
      Data Type: REG_DWORD
      Value: 1 (hex)
</PRE>
<P><LI>Exit Registry Editor.
<P>
</OL>5.Stop and restart the Information Store service.
<P>
6.Using the Exchange Server Administrator program, set the IS Maintenance
<PRE>   schedule (IS maintenance tab of the Server object) to run in the next
   15-minute interval.

</PRE></OL>Once the IS Maintenance interval initiates and performs the Reset Views
operation, the value of Reset Views in the registry will be reset to 0. At
this point the cached views in the Public Information Store will be cleared
and users will not experience the "Client Operation Failed" error. Over
time, if there is a high amount of usage on a folder replica and it is
using a categorized view this problem may reoccur and the steps in this
section may need to be repeated.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base, as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The error code returned, FFFFFBFE, maps to 4294966270 in decimal and this
maps to Error -1026 (0xfffffbfe) = JET_errRecordTooBig.
A categorized view is defined as a view that has a column specified in the
"Group By" field.
