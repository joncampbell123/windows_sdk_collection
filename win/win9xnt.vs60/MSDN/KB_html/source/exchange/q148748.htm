<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0 and 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0 and 5.0

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Windows 3.x and Windows NT, when the Microsoft Exchange or Outlook client 
is installed, the Internet Explorer is assigned as the WEB Browser by default.
<P>
In Windows 95, when the Microsoft Exchange or Outlook client is installed, it 
will use the most-recently installed Win32 Web Browser.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To change the Web Browser that launches when embedded URLs are activated,
follow these steps:
<P>
In Windows 95:
<P>
NOTE: For this to work, you must already have a Windows 95-compatible
Browser installed such as Internet Explorer or Netscape Gold.

<OL><P><LI>Close any Web Browsers that may be running.

<P><LI>Open Start/Settings/Control Panel/View/Options/File Types.

<P><LI>Select URL:HyperText Transfer Protocol, and click the Edit button.

<P><LI>Under Actions, select open, and click the Edit button.

<P><LI>In the "Application used to perform action:" box, click the Browse
   button, and locate the Browser that you want to launch.

<P><LI>When you next launch an embedded URL from inside Microsoft Exchange, you
   will be prompted to select this viewer as your default viewer; click
   Yes. This now will become the default Web Browser for all URL-linked
   applications including FTP, Mailto, News, and so on.
<P>
</OL>CAUTION: By saying No to making this your default browser you may
experience problems with some URLs.
<P>
In Windows 3.x:
<P>
NOTE: For this to work, you must already have a Windows 3.x-compatible
Browser installed such as Internet Explorer or Netscape.
<P>
For information on how to do this, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base and the README.WRI file that is located on the
Microsoft Exchange Client Software CD-ROM:

</PRE></OL>In Windows NT:
<P>
NOTE: For this to work, you must already have a Windows NT-compatible
Browser installed such as Internet Explorer or Netscape.
<P>
CAUTION: This involves Editing the client systems Registry, proceed only
after you are certain that you understand the steps to be completed.

After you have installed the Microsoft Exchange NT Client, you will need to
edit the Registry if you are not going to use Internet Explorer, which is
thedefault.
