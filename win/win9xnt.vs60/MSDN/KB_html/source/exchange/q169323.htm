The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When a Microsoft Exchange client tries to send a message with an
attachment, it may fail with the following error:
<P>
<PRE>   The item could not be sent. Client operation failed.
   You do not have sufficient permission to this object.

</PRE>This problem may happen even if the message is a loop-back message to
yourself, where only the information store is involved in the process.
<P>
Another symptom is that the message will be sent out with an error, and the
recipient receives the message, but without the attachment.
<P>
The same error occurs even on other workstations, indicating that a
specific problem client does not cause the problem.
<P>
It is likely that not all mailboxes are affected.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may be caused by the information store corruption. If you type
the following at an MS-DOS command prompt, it will report the state as
consistent.
<P>
<PRE>   edbutil /mh

</PRE>The Isinteg utility, however, may not report any particular warnings.
<P>
The possible cause of the information store corruption is the virus
protection software that may be checking the Exchange database files.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
There are three options to resolve this problem:

<UL><LI>Restore the last known-good backup of the information store that did not
   exhibit this problem.

<LI>Move all mailboxes to another Exchange Server in the site, recreate the
   information store, and move the mailboxes back.

<LI>Move each mailbox messages to personal folders (PST files), recreate the
   information store, and move mail messages back from the PST to each
   mailbox.
