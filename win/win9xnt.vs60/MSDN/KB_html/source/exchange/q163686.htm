The information in this article applies to: 
<P>
- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0
- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0
 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Exchange services require a Windows NT domain account to
start. This account is called the Microsoft Exchange Service Account. This 
article explains what to do if the Service Account is deleted by mistake.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Service Account is given permissions on the Microsoft Exchange Directory
during the setup process. The Service Account, by default, has permissions 
over all objects in the Directory. Windows NT accounts in the Directory are 
referred to by their SID values and not their names.
<P>
If the Service Account is deleted from the Windows NT Accounts database, 
none of the Microsoft Exchange services will be able to start. Even if this 
Service Account is recreated with the identical name and password, the SID 
value associated with this account will not be the same as that of the 
previous account. Thus, when a Microsoft Exchange service tries to start, 
using this new account, because the SID value of this new account is 
different from that saved in the Directory, the service will not have access 
to the Directory objects and will not be able to start.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
The only recommended solution to this problem is to restore the Windows NT
Security Database (SAM) from a recent backup. This will restore the deleted
Service Account with its original SID value and all the Microsoft Exchange 
services will be able to start.
<P>
If a backup of the SAM is not available, the only other alternative is to 
reinstall Microsoft Exchange Server on all servers affected by the loss of 
the Service Account.
<P>
It will be possible to save information from the Microsoft Exchange
Information Store (PRIV.EDB and PUB.EDB) but the Directory will need to be 
recreated, resulting in the loss of all Directory specific information 
(custom recipients, distribution lists, mailbox details, connectors, and so
forth).
