The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
You can recover deleted items from a public folder in much the same way
that you recover deleted items from your private mailbox. Even though item
recovery may be enabled and working successfully for your mailbox, it may
not be enabled for any public folders you may have rights to.
<P>
When you delete an item in a public folder, the item itself is not "hidden"
and moved to the Deleted items folder as you may expect from the behavior
exhibited by the private mailbox. The item itself is deleted "in place."
It is merely hidden and remains in the public folder for the allotted
interval of time set by the administrator for deleted items.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To successfully recover deleted items from a public folder, the following
must done:

<OL><P><LI>The Exchange Server administrator must enable recovery for the public
   information store. This must be enabled separately from the item
   recovery settings on the private information store. To enable recovery
   for the public information store:
<P>
   a. In the Exchange Server Administrator program, select the public
<P><PRE>      information store to highlight it.
</PRE><P>
   b. On the File menu, click Properties, and change the Item Recovery
<P><PRE>      settings to something other than zero.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Recovery must be enabled on the server that hosts the replica you are
   connected to. Recovery may be enabled on one replica server, but not
   necessarily the one to which you are connected.

<P><LI>To recover the deleted item you must have full read/write/delete
   permissions on the public folder. To do this, set permissions on the
   folder to Editor.
<P>
</OL>Now you can successfully recover items:

<OL><P><LI>Select the public folder from which the item was deleted.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu in the Outlook client, click Recover Deleted Items.
</OL>
