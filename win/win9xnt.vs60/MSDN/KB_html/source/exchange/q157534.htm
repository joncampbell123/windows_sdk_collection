<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0 and 5.0
</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you run Microsoft Exchange on 16-bit Windows platforms (Windows 3.x
Windows for Workgroups 3.1x) you may receive unexplained "Out of Memory"
and "Insufficient Memory" error messages. In some circumstances, a utility
called "Memory Valet" can prevent these errors.
<P>
This utility is available from Microsoft and should only be used after
normal troubleshooting steps have failed. See the following Microsoft
Knowledge Base articles for initial client troubleshooting:

   TITLE     : Troubleshooting Insufficient Memory Errors

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The utility Memory Valet 2.0 is included in Application Note WG1137. This
utility is available from Microsoft Product Support and can be mailed to
customers who continue to have problems with out of memory errors after
following the troubleshooting steps listed in the articles above.
<P>
This application note is not available through electronic services.
<P>
Memory Valet can help in situations in which there is not enough memory
below 640K in the Windows system virtual machine to create a task database
(TDB). In such a situation, the following problems can occur:

<UL><LI>When you try to run an application, you receive the message "Out
   of memory. Close one or more applications and try again."

<LI>An application calls WinExec to launch a component of itself and
   then fails.

<LI>An OLE or dynamic data exchange (DDE) session fails to start the
   server application.

<LI>When you try to run an application, you receive the message "Too
   many files open, please close one or more files," and increasing
   file handles does not correct the problem. (This is a rare
   occurrence and should only affect applications that require more
   than 20 open file handles.)
<P>
</UL>Memory Valet contains two components: the executable file
(Memvalet.exe) and the Control Panel utility (Memval.cpl). Memval.cpl
lets you configure Memory Valet and then displays the current state of
the low-memory area. By using Memval.cpl, you can determine how much
low-memory space is available, the size of the largest free block, and
how many TDBs can fit in low memory given its current state.
