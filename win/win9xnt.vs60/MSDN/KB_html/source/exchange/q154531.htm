The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0 and 4.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In Chapter 6 of the Microsoft Exchange "Administrator's Guide" there are
documented procedures to move the Key Management Server to another server
in the same site. The directions in this section are misleading and could
lead to difficulties in moving the Key Management server. In particular,
the "Administrator's Guide" makes no mention of needing the ORGINAL Key
Management server disk that was created on installation for this process to
succeed.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Here are the revised instructions for moving an existing Key Management
server to another server in the same site:
<P>
It is recommended that you DO NOT move the Key Management server from one
Microsoft Exchange Server computer to another because of the critical
information kept in the Key Management database. There is, however, a
mechanism for moving the Key Management server if the need arises.

<OL><P><LI>Back up the advanced security data on the Microsoft Exchange Server
   computer that hosts the Key Management server. See "Backing Up and
   Restoring Advanced Security Data" in the Microsoft "Administrator's
   Guide," Chapter 6.

<P><LI>Use the Services option in Control Panel to stop the Microsoft Key
   Management Service.

<P><LI>Run the Key Management server Setup program and select the REMOVE ALL
   option. This will rename your Security directory to Security.bak and
<P><PRE>    remove the Key Management server components.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Go to the Microsoft Exchange Server that will now host the Key
   Management server.

<P><LI>Run the Key Management server Setup program, which is on the Microsoft
   Exchange Server compact disc in the EXCHKey Management directory.

<P><LI>Use the Services option in Control Panel to stop the Microsoft Key
   Management Service.

<P><LI>Restore the advanced security data on the server where you ran the Key
   Management server. See "Backing Up and Restoring Advanced Security Data"
   in the Microsoft "Administrator's Guide," Chapter 6.

<P><LI>Place the ORIGINAL Key Management server disk (from the original install
   of the Key Management server) into drive A and start the Key
   Management server service.

<P><LI>After allowing for replication to occur within your organization
   (this could take several hours depending on your topology), run the Key
   Management server setup program on each of the other sites in your
   organization.
<P>
</OL>The original Key Management disk is needed because it contains the 64-bit
encryption key for the database. Because the data that is being moved was
created with this key, it needs to be present to issue and revoke
certificates on the new location. If this disk is not used, new tokens
will need to be issued for all users in the organization.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This process is by design; future versions of the Microsoft Exchange
Administrator's Guide will be updated to reflect the above instructions.
It is highly recommended that the disk that is created during the Key
Management server Setup be backed up and kept in a secure place in the
event that the original is lost or damaged.
