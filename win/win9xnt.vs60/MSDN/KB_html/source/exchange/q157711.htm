The Information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Exchange Server 4.0 Service Pack 3 (SP3) may not correctly
detect whether or not the computer it is being applied to has already had
Microsoft Exchange Server 4.0 Service Pack 2 (SP2) applied to it.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If an Exchange Server that was running SP2 is removed by selecting "Remove
All" from within the Exchange Server Setup program, not all registry keys
associated with this installation are removed. Specifically, the key
that stores the currently installed server and SP version information
remains.
<P>
If a fresh copy of Microsoft Exchange Server is installed onto this
computer running Windows NT Server, the SP3 Update.exe will not detect that
this server has not had SP2 correctly applied to it. As a result,
Update.exe proceeds without warning.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Ensure that you do apply SP2 to a computer running Microsoft Exchange
Server prior to applying SP3 if a previous SP2 installation was removed
from the computer.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 4.0 of Microsoft
Exchange Server. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
