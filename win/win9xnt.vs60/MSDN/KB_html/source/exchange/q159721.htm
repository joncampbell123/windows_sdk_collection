The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0 and 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The English version of Microsoft Exchange Server can support non-English 
Microsoft Exchange Clients.
<P>
To see details on mailboxes, custom recipients, or distribution lists from
a non-English client, the corresponding details templates in the same
language as the client need to be installed on the computer running
Exchange Server. This article describes how to add the localized templates
to Microsoft Exchange Server.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0</h3>
 
<P>
The location of the Template.csv file is on the Microsoft Exchange Server,
version 4.0 compact disk. This location will vary depending on the platform 
and language needed. The directory structure of the compact disk is as 
follows:
<P>
<PRE>   \SETUP
      \ALPHA
         \TPL
            \FRN
            \GER
            \JPN
            \USA
      \I386
         \TPL
            \FRN
            \GER
            \JPN
            \USA
      \MIPS
         \TPL
            \FRN
            \GER
            \JPN
            \USA
      \PPC
         \TPL
            \FRN
            \GER
            \JPN
            \USA

</PRE>Select the platform type; Alpha, I386, or MIPS. Under this directory, change 
to the TPL directory. Under the TPL directory, you will have the choice of 
FRN, GER, JPN, and USA. Within these subdirectories you will find a file 
called Template.csv in each directory.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0</h3>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 the location of the Template.csv files 
changed. These files are now located on the Client compact disk that comes with 
the Microsoft Exchange Server. The exact location of the Template.csv file will 
vary depending on the language of the clients but should be locate in a location 
similar to this:
<P>
<PRE>   \ENG
      \SUPPORT
         \TPL
   \FRN
      \SUPPORT
         \TPL

</PRE>The Template.csv file is located in the TPL subdirectory. If the language needed 
is not on the Client compact that came with the Microsoft Exchange Server, it will
be located on the Client compact disk that has the appropriate language of the
client.
<P>
Steps to Import the Template.csv
 
<P>
To import the localized templates, from the Microsoft Exchange Administrator 
program select the Directory Import command from the Tools menu. This should 
bring up the Directory Import dialog. Select the Template.csv file described above
as the Import File and click OK.
<P>
This should import all the required templates. After the import has completed, 
from the Administrator program the localized templates should be visible under 
Addressing, Details Templates and Addressing, One-Off Address Templates.
<P>
The localized clients should now be able to bring up details on mailboxes,
custom recipients, or distribution lists.
<P>
Users of non-English clients should now be able to bring up details on
mailboxes, custom recipients, or distribution lists.
