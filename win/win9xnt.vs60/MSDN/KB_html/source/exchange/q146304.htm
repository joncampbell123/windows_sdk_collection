The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Import text files require a specific format. The first line should
contain the header, followed by lines of data to import. The header defines
the contents of each field on the data line. The import file can contain an
unlimited number of data lines. This article describes the required header
fields of an import file.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The first field in the header line contains the properties from the schema.
The schema is a collection of properties for objects in the directory. When
you create a recipient with directory import, the following fields are
required:
<P>
<PRE>Column Heading  Description                    Valid Values
</PRE>--------------  -----------------------------  ----------------------
<P>
<PRE>Obj-Class       The type or class of object    Mailbox = mailbox
                that is being created,         Distribution List = dl
                deleted or modified. This      Custom Recipient =
                must be the first field.        remote

Mode            An optional field for          Create
                specifying if the object is    Delete
                to be created, deleted or      Modify
                modified. If this field is     Update
                used, it must be the second
                field. If this field is not
                used, then the default is
                Update. This means that the
                object will be created if it
                does not exist and modified
                if it does exist.

</PRE>Directory Name  The unique directory name of
<PRE>                the object to be created,
                deleted, or modified.

</PRE>NOTE: The Home-Server attribute is required for mailbox objects and the
e-mail address attribute is required for remote objects.
<P>
All additional fields in the header are properties of the modified object.
By default, all fields are separated by commas, and each line ends with a
carriage return and a line feed. If a field contains a comma, the data must
be in double quotation marks (").
<P>
Some fields are multi-valued. For example, the distribution list object has
a member property which can have multiple members. In an import file, these
multiple members are included in the same field, separated by percent (%)
signs.
<P>
The first data line creates a distribution list with distribution lists as
members. You can also populate a distribution list with members that are
not created in the directory. If the members are created at a later time,
they are automatically added to the appropriate distribution list.
<P>
Import files are in .CSV or comma-separated format. This format is read by
database programs, such as Microsoft Access, or spreadsheet programs, such
as Microsoft Excel. You can use sorting features to minimize the effort of
creating and editing import files. For more information, see the Microsoft
Exchange Server Programmer's Guide.
