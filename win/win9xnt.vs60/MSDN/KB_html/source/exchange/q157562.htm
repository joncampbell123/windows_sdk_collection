<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article outlines how to combine two Personal Information Stores (PST).
These steps may be needed for disaster recovery by merging a backup copy of
a PST file or for convenience when moving to a new computer.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
A PST is a file that contains messages, files, and other items stored in 
folders. When you create a PST, you can store it on your computer's hard disk 
drive or on a file server that you have access to. You can create any number
of PSTs and can save, copy, and move them around just like any other file.
<P>
The following example shows how to merge a PST file called Mailbox.pst
with a version from a backup also named Mailbox.pst. The scenario for
this type of restore could be that a new computer was brought online for
a user and they started using Microsoft Exchange with a default PST before 
obtaining their original PST. In this example, the PSTs need to be combined
with special attention given to prevent overwriting the PSTs that have the 
same filename.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Merge Files:</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Make backup copies of both PST files.
</OL>2. Rename the restored version of Mailbox.pst to Mailbox1.pst.
3. Copy Mailbox1.pst to the directory that contains the working version
<PRE>   of Mailbox.pst.
</PRE></OL>4. Add Mailbox1.pst to your active profile using steps 5 through 8.
5. From the Tools menu in the Viewer, click Options and then the Services tab.
6. In the The Following Information Services Are Set Up In This
<PRE>   Profile dialog box, click Personal Information Store, and then click Add.
   In the The Following Information Services Are Set Up In This Profile
   box, click Personal Information Store, and then click Add.
</PRE>7. In the Available Information Services box, click Mailbox1.pst and
<PRE>   then click the OK.
</PRE>8. Keep clicking the OK button until all open dialog boxes are closed.
<P>
You should  now see two Personal Folders icons on the left pane of the 
Microsoft Exchange client. The remaining steps outline how to move information
from the old PST (Mailbox1.pst) to the current PST (Mailbox.pst). When finished,
you will have your old mail merged with the current working file.
<P>
<P><h2>Merging the Duplicate Inbox, Sent Mail, and Deleted Items Folders</h2>
 
<P>
The Inbox, Sent Mail, and Deleted Items folders cannot be moved from one
PST to another. Instead, the items inside of each folder must be moved to
the destination PST. Folders that exist in both PSTs can be moved to
the other PST but the folders will be renamed. The following steps outline
how to move the contents of these folders without creating new folders with
different names. These steps are required when merging the Inbox, Sent Mail,
and Deleted Items folders.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps:</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Expand the subfolders in both sets of Personal Folders if they are
   not currently visible on the left view.
</OL>2. Open the Inbox of Mailbox1.pst so the messages are visible on the
<PRE>   right. Mailbox1.pst should be the second set of personal folders
   listed in the view pane since it was added last.
</PRE></OL>3. Click on a single message in the Inbox of Mailbox1.pst.
4. Select all messages by pressing CTRL-A or choose Select All from the
<PRE>   Edit menu. All messages should be highlighted.
</PRE>5. Click on the list of messages and drag and drop the contents of Inbox
<PRE>   on top of the destination Inbox (Mailbox.pst).
</PRE>6. Verify that the messages were copied into the current PST by opening
<PRE>   the Inbox on Mailbox.pst.
</PRE>7. Repeat these steps for Sent Mail and Deleted Items and for any folder
<PRE>   that exists in both PSTs.

</PRE><h2>Merging Unique Folders</h2>
 
<P>
If a folder does not exist in both PST files, you can simply drag and drop
a folder to move its contents. These steps may be useful when restoring
from a backup if the new PST hasn't had the same folder names created yet.
If the folder exists with the same name, see the steps above.

<OL><P><LI>Expand the subfolders in both sets of Personal Folders if they are
   not currently visible on the left view.
</OL>2. Choose a folder in Mailbox1.pst that you want moved to Mailbox.pst by
<PRE>   single-clicking on the folder.
</PRE></OL>3. Drag the folder to the destination PST file and drop it on top of
<PRE>   Personal Folders. Your set of folders may be named something else.
   The top level of the PST file is the destination for the drag and
   drop.
</PRE>4. Repeat steps for each unique folder.
<P>
Once you have completed these steps and have verified that the current PST
is up to date with all of your messages, you can remove the second PST from
your profile. The following steps outline this procedure. Note that the PST
file is not deleted from the disk during this procedure. The reference for
the file is only removed from the profile.

<OL><P><LI>From the Tools menu in the Viewer, click Options, and then click
   the Services tab.
</OL>2. In The Following Information Services Are Set Up In This Profile
<PRE>   box, click the second Personal Information Store, and then click
   the Delete button. If you need to confirm that this is the
   appropriate PST file, click Properties before Delete. In our example
   Mailbox1.pst should be the second PST.
</PRE></OL>3. Click the OK button until all open dialog boxes are closed. The PST
<PRE>   is now removed from the active profile.

</PRE>Note:  For more information on moving and copying items and folders to the
new PST, see the Moving or Copying a Private Folder and Moving or Copying 
Items to Other Folders topics in the Microsoft Exchange Help file.
