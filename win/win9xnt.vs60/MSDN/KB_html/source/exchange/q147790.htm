The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOM</h2>
 
<P>
When you set up Microsoft Exchange as either a requestor or a Directory
Synchronization (Dir-Sync) server, you have the option to select a trust
level that ranges from 0 to 100. This is used to filter out recipients that
have a higher trust level. If the trust level for any particular mailbox or
the Dir-Sync object is changed after the first Dir-Sync cycle, these
changes
will be ignored.
<P>
For example, suppose you set up Microsoft Exchange as a Dir-Sync server
with a remote Dir-Sync requestor to it with a trust level of 90, and all of
your current mailboxes have a trust level of 20 (the default). Because the
mailboxes trust level is lower than that of the requestor's object, the
addresses will be exchanged. However, if later on the trust level of any of
the existing mailboxes is modified to 95 (making it higher than that of the
remote requestor), a delete/modify transaction will not be sent to
Microsoft Mail.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This functionality is designed into Microsoft Exchange, but is contrary to
Microsoft Mail for PC Networks behavior of adding or removing a particular
user from being included in Dir-Sync where a transaction is immediately
sent to reflect this change.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, request a full export from Microsoft Exchange
to send out a full replacement for the Exchange side address list.
