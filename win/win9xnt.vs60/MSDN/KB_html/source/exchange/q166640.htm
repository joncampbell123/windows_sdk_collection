The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you attempt to delete or move Read Receipts to the Deleted Items,
Outbox, or Sent Items folders using a Microsoft Exchange Client connected
to Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0, the following error message may
appear:
<P>
<PRE>   The item could not be deleted. Client operation failed.

</PRE>The Read Receipts that cause this problem were returned from messages sent
to PROFS users, using the LINKAGE PROFS connector.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
There are two workarounds for this problem:

<OL><P><LI>If the Read Receipts are first moved to a personal folder (PST) file,
   they can be deleted.

<P><LI>If you log in Off-line and delete the Read Receipts, and then
   synchronize the Off-line personal folder (OST), they will be deleted.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Exchange Server configurations that are affected by this problem
include:

<UL><LI>If you upgrade Microsoft Exchange Server from version 4.0 to 5.0, any
   Read Receipts generated before the upgrade that still exist after the
   upgrade will produce this problem.

<LI>If the PROFS connector is installed on a Microsoft Exchange Server
   version 4.0, Read Receipts generated from messages sent over the PROFS
   connector originating from a user on a Microsoft Exchange Server version
   5.0 will produce this problem.
<P>
</UL>Microsoft Exchange Server configurations that are not affected by this
problem include:

<UL><LI>If the LINKAGE connector is installed on Microsoft Exchange Server
   version 4.0, Read Receipts generated from messages sent from a Microsoft
   Exchange Server version 4.0 user across the LINKAGE connector to a PROFs
   user can be deleted.

<LI>If the LINKAGE connector is installed on Microsoft Exchange Server
   version 5.0, Read Receipts generated from messages sent from a Microsoft
   Exchange Server version 5.0 user across the LINKAGE connector to a PROFs
   user can be deleted.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>

version 5.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service
