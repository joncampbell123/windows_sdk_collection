<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you make changes to a distribution list (DL), an error may occur if a
new Windows NT account has been assigned to the mailbox which is the owner
of that DL. You may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Changes to the distribution list membership could not be saved.
   You do not have the sufficient permissions to perform this
   operation on this object.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The error occurs when you change who has the role of user on the
Permissions tab of a mailbox. This does not happen when the owner of the DL
is changed by selecting a different mailbox.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around the problem, open the Distribution List General property
page for the mailbox you want to configure, make a change to the DL (for
example, type something in the Notes box), and then close the dialog box.
This will cause the Owner's Mailbox for the newly assigned user to be re-
checked and will allow the newly assigned user permission to update the DL.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
