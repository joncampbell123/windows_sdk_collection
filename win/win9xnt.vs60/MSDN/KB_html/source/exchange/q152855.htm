<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Anonymous Posting service will allow you to have users post anonymous
submissions to a Microsoft Exchange Public Folder (PF). This article
describes the steps necessary to set up the Anonymous Posting service.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following steps are required to set up the Anonymous Posting service:

<OL><P><LI>Create a Windows NT service account. Make sure that you grant this
   account the Logon as a Service privilege. In addition, make sure that
   this account is a member of the ADMIN group. If this account does not
   have administrative privileges, you will receive the following error:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Could not start the Anonymous Posting Service on \\&lt;Computer Name&gt;.
      Error 1069: The Service did not start due to a Logon Failure.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Create a mailbox named Anonymous. Set the Primary Windows NT Account for
   the mailbox to the user account created in step 1. At this point, make
   sure to note the following settings of the Mailbox:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Organization Name
      Home site
      Directory Name (Advanced Tab for the Mailbox)
</PRE>
<P><LI>Create the anonymous PF:
<P>
<P><PRE>    A. Create the PF from a Microsoft Exchange client.
    B. Open the folder properties and select Permissions.
    C. Add the Anonymous mailbox to the permissions list with the Editor
       Role.
    D. Select to the Administration tab and select the folder assistant.
    E. Add a rule, select FROM, choose the anonymous mailbox, and click OK.
    F. Choose FORWARD TO, select the anonymous mailbox, and choose OK.
    G. In the folder assistant dialog box, click Edit Rule, and then click
       Delete.
    H. Click the advanced button, check the box labeled Only Items That Do
       not Match These Conditions, and Click OK.
    I. Close all remaining open dialog boxes.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Copy the Anonymous Posting service files from the Microsoft Exchange
   Server CD to a directory on your hard drive where you want to run the
   service from. These files are located in the following location:
<P>
<P><PRE>      \Setup\&lt;platform&gt;\sampapps\server\anon.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Install the files necessary for the Anonymous Posting service. Do this
   by running the Instanon.exe program that you copied in step 4. You will
   need to enter the information that you wrote down when you created the
   Anonymous mailbox. Choose OK to install the service.

<P><LI>Make sure that the Anonymous Posting account has the following rights
   in the Microsoft Exchange permissions context:
<P>
   - In the site object, the Anonymous Posting account needs at least the
<P><PRE>     Administrator role.
</PRE>   - In the Organization object the Anonymous Posting account also needs
<P><PRE>     at least the Administrator role.
</PRE>
<P><LI>To test the Anonymous folder, start a Microsoft Exchange client, go to
   the Anonymous public folder, and compose a new post in this forum. Type
   in a message and post the message.

<P><LI>If the Anonymous Posting service is not running, you will be able to
   post a message with no errors, but the message will not appear in the
   PF until the service is restarted.
<P>
</OL>For additional information about the Anonymous Posting service, please
refer to the Anon.wri file in the Setup\&lt;platform&gt;\sampapps\server\anon
directory on the Microsoft Exchange Server CD. For additional information
on sending mail from one user to another and displaying an anonymous sender
