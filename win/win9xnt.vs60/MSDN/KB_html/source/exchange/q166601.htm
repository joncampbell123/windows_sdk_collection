The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0 and 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The Move Mailbox command in the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program is
used to move a mailbox from one server in a Microsoft Exchange Server site
to another server in the same site. After using this command, the user may
log on to the mailbox on the new server and find one or more folders and
their contents missing.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Each Microsoft Exchange mailbox contains the following default system
folders: Inbox, Outbox, Sent Items, and Deleted Items. The problem
mentioned in the Symptoms section will occur if one of these default system
folders has been renamed and a new folder created with that default name.
After moving the mailbox, the renamed folder and its contents will not
appear in the mailbox.
<P>
For example, the problem will occur if the server-based system folder
"Inbox" is renamed "My Inbox" and a new folder called "Inbox" is created.
"My Inbox" will remain a system folder and all new mail will be delivered
to it.
<P>
After using the Move Mailbox command, the default system folder will be
renamed "Inbox" and will contain the mail from the non-system "Inbox"
folder. The "My Inbox" folder and its contents will not be in the mailbox.
<P>
This only occurs when the server-based folder is renamed and another folder
exists with the default name of the server-based folder. For example, if
"Inbox" is renamed "My Inbox" and there is no other folder named "Inbox,"
the contents of "My Inbox" will exist on the new server in the "Inbox"
folder after the Move Mailbox Command has been executed.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0.
This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange Server 5.0 U.S.
Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):
<P>
<PRE>   S E R V P A C K

</PRE>Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. We are researching the problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To avoid this problem, rename the non-system folder and then rename the
system folder to its original name before using the Move Mailbox Command.
<P>
If you have already used the Move Mailbox Command, the folder and its
contents will need to be recovered from the last full backup. For
additional information about recovering a single mailbox, please see the
following article(s) in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : INF: XADM: Recovering a Single Mailbox from the Online
               Backup

</PRE>After the single folder has been restored to a PST, it can be manually
moved back up to the server.
