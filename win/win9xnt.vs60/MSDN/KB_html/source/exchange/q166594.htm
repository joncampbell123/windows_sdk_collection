The information in this article applies to:

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Exchange Message Transfer Agent (MTA) has a backlog of
messages (up to the default threshold) waiting to be delivered. The MTA
makes an association with another LAN-MTA (RPC connection), but does not
deliver mail over this connection.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The MTAs on both sides of the connection detect that the opposite MTA has
the Turn to send messages. Because of this confusion, neither side sends
messages.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0.
A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-
tested and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific
problem. Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem,
Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains
this fix. Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service
Pack for Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on
obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The initiating MTA has passed the Turn to the receiving MTA, but the
receiving MTA does not get it because the association is lost (for whatever
reason). When the initiating MTA recovers the association and asks for the
Turn back, the receiving MTA ignores this request because it does not
believe it has the Turn. Therefore, no one has the Turn and no messages
will be sent.
<P>
After the message threshold has been reached (default value is 50), the
MTAs will make a new association and begin delivering messages.
