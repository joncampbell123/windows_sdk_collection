The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client version   4.0
<LI>Microsoft Exchange Windows 95 client version  4.0
<LI>Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client version   4.0
</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you print a form in the Microsoft Exchange client, you only print a
"textized" copy of the form; the printout does not have the graphical look
of the form. This is by product design. However, a Microsoft Exchange Form
can be extended very easily in Visual Basic 4.0 16-bit to include an option
button or another control to allow you to print the graphical form.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To extend a Microsoft Exchange Form so that you can print a graphical view
of the form:

<OL><P><LI>Create a form in Electronic Form Designer (EFD) and install the form,
   then open the VBP file in Visual Basic 4.0 16-bit. (For more information
   on extending a form see Chapter 9 of the "Application Designer's
   Guide.")

<P><LI>Add a button control to your form and add the following code to
   this button control:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Me.PrintForm
</PRE><P>
   This allows the user to click this button to print the graphical form.

<P><LI>Now you need to re-compile the code in Visual Basic 4.0 16-bit, and then
   install the form using the Forms Manager in the Microsoft Exchange
   client.
<P>
</OL>When you run the form in the Microsoft Exchange client, you will be able to
click this button to print a graphical view of this form.
<P>
NOTE: When you print the form by clicking Print on button on the toolbar of
the message, or by clicking Print on the File menu, you will still get a
textized version of the form. Only the button you just created allows you
to print the graphical form.
