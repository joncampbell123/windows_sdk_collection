The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0 and 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When installing the Windows 3.x version of the Microsoft Exchange client,
you may receive the following error:
<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft Exchange setup was interrupted before your new
   software was fully installed.

   You can run Microsoft Exchange Setup in its entirety at a
   later time to complete the installation.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This error appears when you have another older version of Mapi.dll already
installed on your computer that has a newer version stamp -- a version
number newer then the one being installed by Microsoft Exchange.
<P>
For example, Novell GroupWise installs a pre-Exchange version of Mapi.dll
that has a version stamp of 4.1. Before Exchange setup tries to copy
Mapi.dll, it checks the version of the file. If the version of the
previously installed file is newer than the one that setup is trying to
install (4.0), the setup skips the file without copying it. This in turn
causes the error.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve the problem:

<UL><LI>Delete the current Mapi.dll file from the Windows\System directory, and
   then re-run Microsoft Exchange setup.  
<P>
   -or-

<LI>To correct this problem on multiple workstations, modify the Exchang.inf
   file as outlined below.
<P>
</UL><h3>Steps to Modify Exchang.inf File</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Make a backup copy of your Exchang.inf file before proceeding.

<P><LI>Use Notepad to open the Exchang.inf file.

<P><LI>Find the following line in the [MAPI] section:
<P>
   "mapi.dll"=5,mapi.dll,,,,1996-03-11,,1033,,,,,,,,
<P><PRE>      890464,SYSTEM,,,4.0.837.7,
</PRE>
<P><LI>The number preceding the last comma is the version number of the
   Mapi.dll file that is being installed. Change this number to be greater
   than the version number of the Mapi.dll file you already have installed.
   For example, if the currently installed file is version 4.1, change the
   line as follows:
<P>
   "mapi.dll"=5,mapi.dll,,,,1996-03-11,,1033,,,,,,,,
<P><PRE>      890464,SYSTEM,,,4.1.0.1,
</PRE>
<P><LI>Save Exchang.inf as a text file.

<P><LI>Re-run setup.
<P>
</OL>This will result in the 4.0.837.7 version of Mapi.dll being written to the
Windows\System directory.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
