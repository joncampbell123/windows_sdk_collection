The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server versions 4.0 and 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a
Registry Key" Help topic in Regedt32.exe.
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After you move a mailbox from one server to another, Calendar and Task
reminders no longer work.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Using the Move Mailbox feature of Microsoft Exchange Server corrupts
certain properties on search folders. This does not cause any corruption in
messages or in the database but does change certain properties on search
folders.
<P>
A search folder is a View/Sort/Filter of any kind. It does not contain
messages but, instead, contains pointers to messages.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
NOTE: The fix for this problem is only implemented in the Exchange
Administrator program for version 5.0. The 5.0 Exchange Administrator
program can be used to fix this problem on an Exchange 4.0 server.
<P>
After applying the hotfix for this problem, perform the following steps to
clean reminders:
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor
can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

<OL><P><LI>Add the following registry key:
<P>
<P><PRE>      HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Exchange\MSExchangeAdminCommon
      \CleanReminders
      Type: DWORD
      Value = 1
</PRE>
<P><LI>Open the Exchange Administrator program from the server that the hotfix
   was applied to.
</OL>3. Select the desired mailboxes from the Recipients container.
<PRE>   NOTE: The users should not be logged on to the server when you perform
   these steps.
</PRE></OL>4. From the Tools menu, select Clean Mailbox.
5. Click OK on the Clean Mailbox dialog box, and then click on the warning
<PRE>   dialog box.
   Wait until it finishes.
</PRE>6. Open the Outlook client and log on to the mailbox that encountered the
<PRE>   reminders problem.

   Result: The reminders folder will be rebuilt, and reminders should be
   visible.

</PRE>Note: If the registry entry is present and set to 1, the Clean Mailbox
feature will ONLY clean the Reminders folder for the selected users. No
messages will be deleted.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0.
<P>
<P>
This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on obtaining the
Service Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge
