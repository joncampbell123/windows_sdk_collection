The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server versions 4.0, 5.0, and 5.5
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
You may need to set up a Microsoft Exchange Server computer to recover
information from the Exchange directory service contained in the Dir.edb
file.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Dir.edb file is Windows NT machine name specific and thus it can
only be restored to a server with the same computer name.
<P>
NOTE: The following steps will allow you to construct a server offline. The
resulting server will not be usable in your production Exchange
environment.
<P>
Steps to build a Dir.edb recovery server:

<OL><P><LI>In the production domain where the Exchange service account resides,
   install a computer as a backup domain controller (BDC) with the same
   version of Microsoft Windows NT Server and service pack level as the
   production Exchange Server computer.

<P><LI>Make sure that the recovery server computer has enough free disk space
   and any other devices that are necessary, such as a tape drive or CD-ROM
   drive. Take this computer offline by isolating it from the production
   network on a hub.

<P><LI>Promote this server to a primary domain controller (PDC) and reboot the
   computer.

<P><LI>In Server Manager for Domains, add a BDC with the same Windows NT
   computer name as the Exchange Server computer, and rename the recovery
   server to the original Exchange Server computer name. (Verify that you
   are not on the production network first.)
<P>

<PRE></PRE>      TITLE     : Renaming a Windows NT PDC or BDC

</PRE><P><LI>Reboot the server. Now the recovery server is running the same version
   of Windows NT Server as the production Exchange Server computer.

<P><LI>Install Microsoft Exchange Server as a new site, but use the same
   organization and site name as the production Exchange environment. Make
   sure to select the same service account as the production domain to use
   for the Exchange services.

<P><LI>Update to the same service pack level as the production Exchange Server
   computer.

<P><LI>Restore from backup the previous Microsoft Exchange directory store
   and/or the Microsoft Exchange information store.
