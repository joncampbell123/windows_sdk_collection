The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you configure a Microsoft Exchange Server to join an existing
Microsoft
Exchange Site that has any or all of the following connectors installed:
<P>
Linkage 3.2 PROFS
SNADS
NOTES
<P>
you may receive the following error messages:
<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft Exchange Server Setup
   An error occurred while processing an e-mail address. To view details of
   the error, see the application event log in the Windows NT Event Viewer
   on the Microsoft Exchange Server computer.
   Microsoft Exchange Server Setup
   ID no. c1030b37

   Microsoft Exchange Server Setup
   Email addresses for address type 'SNADS' were bot generated because an
   error occurred. To view details of the error, see the application event
   log in the Windows NT Event Viewer on the Microsoft Exchange Server
   computer.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When encountering like addresses, the Microsoft Exchange System Attendant
will try to create a unique proxy address. It will only try 20 times to
generate this unique proxy address. When it encounters more than 20 like
addresses, it fails to create a unique proxy address.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server,
versions 4.0 and 5.0.
<P>
A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested
and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem.
Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix.
Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.

<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To install this fix:

<OL><P><LI> If it exists in the exchsrvr\address\profs directory, rename
</OL>IBMPXGEN.DLL
<PRE>    to IBMPXGEN.OLD.
</PRE></OL>2.  If it exists in the exchsrvr\address\snads directory, rename
IBMPXGEN.DLL
<PRE>    to IBMPXGEN.OLD.
</PRE>3.  If it exists in the exchsrvr\address\notes directory, rename
NTSPXGEN.DLL
<PRE>    to NTSPXGEN.OLD.
</PRE>4.  Copy the new IBMPXGEN.DLL to the \exchsrvr\address\profs directory and
the
<PRE>    \exchsrvr\address\snads directory.
</PRE>5.  Copy the new NTSPXGEN.DLL to the \exchsrvr\address\notes directory.
6.  Start the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program in RAW mode,
<P>
<PRE>       Admin.exe /raw

</PRE><P><LI> Expand the appropriate Site that this Exchange Server belongs to.
</OL>8.  In the Configuration Container, expand the Addressing container.
9.  Expand the E-mail Address Generators container.
10. Select the appropriate email address generator object. This could be
the
<PRE>    Linkage PROFS Address Generator, the Linkage SNADS Address Generator,
</PRE></OL>or
<PRE>    the Linkage NOTES Address Generator.
</PRE>11. From the File menu, click Raw Properties.
12. Once the RAW properties dialog opens, select the File-Version attribute
<PRE>    from the Object attributes list box.
</PRE>13. Click the Editor command button.
14. If this is a Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0, select the File
<PRE>    Version editor type. Enter 5.5.1960.8 (periods denote what should be
</PRE>entered
<PRE>    in each box presented).
</PRE>15. If this is a Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0, change the HEX
number
<PRE>    displayed to 0800A80705000500.
</PRE>16. Click OK in whichever editor box you are using.
17. Click the SET command button.
18. Click OK on the RAW Properties dialog box.
<P>
Making this change on one Server in each Site in sufficient. Newer proxy
generator DLL’s are automatically replicated around to Servers with older
versions. This is done by checking the Directory entry for each email
address
generator. After making the change to the first Server you will need to
allow
time for the directory entry to replicate to all the Servers in the Site.
<P>
By design this change should NOT require the Directory or System Attendant
services to be re-started. However, if the proxy DLL was loaded in memory
at the
time this change occured, it is possible that a restart of these services
will
be necessary.
