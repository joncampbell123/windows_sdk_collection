</PRE>1.4 New Functionality in This Release
<P>
This release of Microsoft Exchange Server includes new client support and a
number of new features. These are described below.
<P>
1.5 Macintosh Client
<P>
Microsoft Exchange Client for the Apple Macintosh adds to the client
platforms available in Microsoft Exchange Server 4.0.  The Microsoft
Exchange Client for the Apple Macintosh supports advanced features such as
grouping and filtering in views, discussion databases, auto-signature,
rules, sending/sharing of documents, digital signatures, offline folders,
and access to the Internet through the Internet Mail Connector
<P>
1.6 PowerPC Client
<P>
Microsoft Exchange Client for Windows NT is also available for the PowerPC
platform.
<P>
1.7 PowerPC Server
<P>
Microsoft Exchange Server also adds the server software for the PowerPC
platform. With this addition, Microsoft Exchange Server completes its
support for high-end hardware platforms, offering the same advanced
functionality such as security integrated into the network operating
system, use of server operating system monitoring, and backup tools on
Intel and RISC platforms.
<P>
1.8 Internet Mail Connector and Macintosh File Attachments
<P>
With the release of Microsoft Exchange Server, all file attachments from an
Apple Macintosh will be mapped to MIME-standard bodyparts so that MIME
complaint clients and gateways can decode these attachments. Additionally,
the Internet Mail Connector maps any incoming bodyparts to windows or
Macintosh file types.
<P>
1.9 Internet Mail Connector Supports Dial-up Connections
<P>
This release enables support of dial-up connections by the Internet Mail
Connector to send/receive messages to Internet service providers over a
telephone connection.
<P>
1.9.1  Administrator Permissions Required to Run the Internet Mail
<PRE>       Connector

</PRE>To administer the Internet Mail Connector, the account under which you are
running the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program must have
administrative rights on the computer where the Internet Mail Connector
service is running. This account must be listed as a member of the
Administrators group in the User Manager for that computer. If the account
does not have administrative rights, an error message will be displayed
when you attempt to open the Internet Mail Connector properties, and some
fields will be disabled.
<P>
1.9.2  Internet Mail Connector Word Wrap and Text Quoting Registry
<PRE>       Parameters

</PRE>Two new registry values have been added under the Internet Mail Connector's
Parameters key to provide control over the Internet Mail Connector 's word-
wrap and text quoting behavior. The first, UseRTFText, is a DWORD value
that specifies if reply and forward text will be quoted in outgoing non-
TNEF. If it is enabled (non-zero), Internet style quoting is applied to
reply and forward text by inserting a "&gt;" character before each line. If
UseRTFText is disabled (set to zero or not present), no Internet style
quoting is applied. UseRTFText is enabled by default.
<P>
The second new registry value is EnableMIMEWrap. This is a DWORD value that
controls word-wrap in outgoing non-TNEF MIME messages. If it is enabled,
lines in MIME messages are wrapped at a fixed column. If EnableMIMEWrap is
disabled (and UseRTFText is also disabled), lines are wrapped using quoted
printable encoding. MIME enabled readers will unwrap the lines, restoring
the original text flow, but users with non-MIME readers will see a "="
character appended to each wrapped line of text. EnableMIMEWrap is enabled
by default.
<P>
Note that UseRTFText also affects word-wrap. If enabled, text lines in all
non-TNEF messages are wrapped at a fixed column, regardless of the setting
of EnableMIMEWrap. The word-wrap setting for non-MIME messages on the
Internet Mail Connector properties in Microsoft Exchange Server
Administrator program is ignored.
<P>
1.9.3  Using Internet-style Quoting with List Servers
<P>
When the UseRTFText registry parameter is enabled, Internet style quoting
will be applied to forward and reply text in messages. This quoting will
also be applied to text that is cut and pasted from a message into a
compose note. When sending a message with a command to a list server, it is
important to make sure the text is not quoted; otherwise, the list server
will not be able to interpret the command. You can type the command
manually. Alternatively, you can use the Paste Special command to paste the
plain text. Do not paste the formatted text.
<P>
1.9.4  Site Address Required to Start the Internet Mail Connector
<P>
The Internet Mail Connector determines the domain to use in the originator
address for reports from the site address for its address type. If you set
the address type on the Internet Mail property page of the Internet Mail
Connector properties to a type for which there is no site address, the
Internet Mail Connector will not start.
<P>
If you want to set an address type without specifying the site address, you
can modify the registry by adding the value SiteDomain to
SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeIMC\Parameters. SiteDomain is a
REG_SZ value that should be set to the domain you would like to be used in
the originator address for reports generated by the Internet Mail
Connector.
<P>
1.9.5  Sending Imported Messages Using the Internet Mail Connector
<P>
Messages that have been imported into Microsoft Exchange with the migration
tools cannot be embedded in messages and sent through the Internet Mail
Connector. The Internet Mail Connector will not be able to process the
embedded message and will generate a non-delivery report (NDR). The problem
will also occur if you try to embed an unsent message into another message
and send it out the Internet Mail Connector.
<P>
To work around this problem, cut and paste the contents of the migrated
message or forward it instead of embedding it in another message.
<P>
1.9.6 The Microsoft Exchange Server Routing Table
<P>
The Internet Mail Connector reads the Microsoft Exchange Server routing
table every 15 minutes to determine its routing responsibilities. The 15-
minute interval is configurable through the Windows NT Registry. It is
recommended that you use this default setting (0xF), but if you need to
modify it, use the following registry key:
<P>
<PRE>   SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeIMC
         \Parameters\RouteCalculationInterval

</PRE>Note Setting this registry value to 0x0 means the Internet Mail Connector
would check the routing table only at startup.
<P>
The Internet Mail Connector checks the Last Modified field for the routing
table to determine whether changes have been made. If the Last Modified
time on the routing table is newer than the timestamp on the Route.txt
file, the Internet Mail Connector will update its routing information and
create the Route.txt file in the Exchsrvr\Imcdata\Log directory.
<P>
Using the Route.txt File
<P>
The Route.txt file contains the current routes that the Internet Mail
Connector will use to determine delivery destinations for connected sites.
This file is not used by the Internet Mail Connector for routing; it's a
text representation of the routes that the Internet Mail Connector is
responsible for.
<P>
If changes are made to the routing table, at the next checking interval,
the Internet Mail Connector will copy the existing Route.txt file to
Route.old and update the Route.txt file with the latest changes. The
Internet Mail Connector always reads the routing table at startup.
<P>
Troubleshooting a Routing Problem
<P>
If the Internet Mail Connector does not route properly, check the following
configuration items:
<P>
Check the entries in the Control Panel, Network, TCP/IP, and DNS
configuration. The host name and domain name need to be reachable by other
computers (that is, registered within the DNS or specified in the local
HOSTS file).
<P>
Check the Internet Mail Connector Connected Sites property page to ensure
that all entries are correct.
<P>
Check the routing table using the Site Addressing object, Routing property
page in the Microsoft Exchange Server Administration program.
<P>
Additionally check the following files:
<P>
Route.txt: The current routes the Internet Mail Connector services.
Route.old: The previous routing information the Internet Mail Connector
<PRE>           used before it created the new Route.txt file.

</PRE>Equal Cost Routes and Non-Delivered Mail
<P>
If your configuration consists of multiple routes with the same cost for a
destination, the Internet Mail Connector will balance loads between the
different routes. If a route has problems, any queued mail for that
destination will not be rerouted through a different route. If the problems
continue longer than the maximum allowed delivery time-outs, a non-delivery
report will be generated in these cases.
<P>
Least Cost Routes
<P>
If your configuration contains multiple routes to the same destination with
different costs, the Internet Mail Connector will use only the least cost
route defined. If that link is unavailable due to a communication problem,
the Internet Mail Connector will not use any of the higher cost routes.
Proper configuration of your DNS with MX records can override this behavior
and allow all incoming mail to use a secondary route.
<P>
Routing Table Can't Be Read
<P>
If the Internet Mail Connector has started and the routing table cannot be
read at the specified checking interval, the Internet Mail Connector will
continue to use its existing routing information. No event is logged in
this case.
<P>
Correction to the Administrator's Guide
<P>
In the "Using Routing Addresses for Address Space Entries" section in
Chapter 11, The Routing Address tab no longer needs to be used when
connecting two replicated Microsoft Exchange sites. It can be used to send
mail to different organizations that are not replicated.
<P>
1.9.7  Maximum Number of Inbound and Outbound Connections
<P>
Setting the maximum number of inbound and outbound connections to 0 on the
Connections property page does not stop the Internet Mail Connector from
accepting inbound or attempting outbound connections. To stop both inbound
and outbound connections, set the Transfer Mode to None. To stop inbound
connections, choose Outbound only. To stop outbound connections, choose
Inbound Only.
<P>
1.9.8  Removing an Installed Internet Mail Connector
<P>
Before removing the Internet Mail Connector, be sure there are no messages
left in the queues awaiting delivery. Follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Connections property page, set the transfer mode to None
   (Flush Queues).
</OL>2. Set the retry interval for the connector message queues to a short
<PRE>   interval, such as .25 (15 minutes).
</PRE></OL>3. Set the message time-outs for normal, urgent, and non-urgent mail to
<PRE>   one hour.
</PRE>4. Restart the Internet Mail Connector.
<P>
The Internet Mail Connector will not accept new messages and will continue
to process the messages already in its queues. Non-Delivery Reports (NDRs)
will be generated for any messages that cannot be delivered in one hour
(host unreachable, for example). Check the status of the queues on the
Queues property page. When the queues are empty, shut down the Internet
Mail Connector and begin removing the installation.
<P>
1.9.9  Loopback Detection
<P>
The Internet Mail Connector will allow configurations where SMTP
connections are made to itself. There are cases where this behavior is
desired, such as when one Microsoft Exchange user addresses another using
an SMTP proxy. However, this can also allow loopbacks and inefficient
configurations. You can configure the Internet Mail Connector so that it
won't initiate SMTP connections if the destination host's IP address
matches its own. Instead, it will create a non-delivery report (NDR) for
the message. To enable the Internet Mail Connector's connection loopback
detection, create the following DWORD registry value and set it equal to 1:
<P>
<PRE>   SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeIMC
         \Parameters\DisableLoopbackConnection

</PRE>1.9.10  Delivery Restrictions for Custom Recipients
<P>
Delivery of inbound messages to custom recipients cannot be controlled
using the Delivery Restrictions property page.
<P>
1.9.11  Internet Mail Connector Performance Monitor Counters
<P>
The Microsoft Exchange Server Performance Monitor Counters for the Internet
Mail Connector described in Chapter 17 of the Administrator's Guide have
changed.
<P>

Outbound messages awaiting delivery     Messages queued for delivery in
                                        the Internet Mail Connector's
                                        scheduler, which roughly
                                        corresponds to the message files
                                        in the IMCDATA\OUT directory.
                                        Since some messages require
                                        delivery to multiple hosts,
                                        there will be more entries in
                                        the queue than there are files
                                        in the directory.

</PRE>1.9.13  Using a Wildcard MX DNS Record
<P>
If you are using a wildcard MX DNS record, the Internet Mail Connector will
append the default domain from your TCP/IP configuration to each host name
before trying to resolve it in DNS. To prevent this, create a REG_DWORD
registry value named DisableResolverSearchList under the
SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeIMC\Parameters key and set its
value to 1. This will stop the Internet Mail Connector from appending a
domain to host names before trying to resolve them.
<P>
1.9.14 Using the Internet Mail Connector as a Site Connector
<P>
In Chapter 8 (Planning Your Connectors) of the Microsoft Exchange Server
Concepts and Planning Guide, the "Connecting Microsoft Exchange Server
Sites over the Internet" section has changed. The following information
supplements the section and describes steps that can be eliminated.
<P>
Step 1: Multiple Internet Mail Connectors in one site is no longer
required.
<P>
Step 8: The address space routing address is no longer required. Sites that
can be connected (reached) only through site B (that is, site A has no
direct connection to them) do not need to be added to the Connected Sites
property page on the Internet Mail Connector on site A. The Internet Mail
Connector reads the routing information from the Microsoft Exchange Server
routing table and determines that these sites are routable through site B.
<P>
Step 9: You no longer have to add routing addresses for address spaces that
are serviced on other sites that an Internet Mail Connector will connect
to. When sites are replicated, the Internet Mail Connector will access this
information directly.
<P>
In addition to the steps in the Concepts and Planning Guide, use the
following steps to connect Site A and Site B:

<OL><P><LI>Use the Connected Sites property page on site A to add a new
<P><PRE>    connected site for site B.
</OL></PRE>2. Using the Routing Address tab from the Connected Sites property page,
<PRE>   add the routing address for the Internet Mail Connector computer on
   site B.
</PRE></OL>3. Add site A to the Connected Sites property page for the Internet Mail
<PRE>   Connector on site B and use the routing address for site A.

</PRE>Step 10: It is no longer necessary to define custom recipients in the site
where the Internet Mail Connector servicing the external Internet mail
resides.
<P>
1.9.15  Connecting Sites with the Internet Mail Connector
<P>
For best performance when connecting sites, configure the Internet Mail
Connector to use MIME encoding. When sending TNEF, the Internet Mail
Connector handles attachments differently when performing MIME encoding
than it does with uuencode. Attachments are transmitted in the TNEF data,
instead of being broken out separately, as they are in uuencoded messages.
Due to the internal design of the Internet Mail Connector, this results in
much better performance in processing TNEF messages. Therefore, to maximize
site replication performance, it is recommended that you use MIME encoding
with TNEF when connecting sites using the Internet Mail Connector.
<P>
1.9.16  Do Not Use an Ending Period to Specify an FQDN
<P>
When specifying message delivery by domain, a fully qualified domain name
(FQDN) ending with a period (.) is not supported. A non-delivery report
(NDR) specifying "host unreachable" will be generated.
<P>
1.9.17  Specifying the Maximum Message Size
<P>
The description of the No limit option on the Internet Mail Connector
General property page in the "Specifying the Maximum Message Size" in
Chapter 11 of the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator's Guide should
read as follows: Send an inbound or outbound message of any size.
<P>
1.9.18  Forwarding Outbound Mail to a Host Using Dial-up
<P>
The Internet Mail Connector has a default setting that creates up to 10
outbound connections to any particular host and sends up to 8 messages in
any single connection. For performance reasons, you should consider
changing the settings to 1 for outbound connections and to 100 for maximum
messages.
<P>
To change these settings:

<OL><P><LI>In the Administrator window, choose Connections.
</OL>2. Double-click the Internet Mail Connector.
3. Select the Connections tab.
4. Under Transfer Mode, choose Advanced.
5. Change the defaults to the following:
<P>
<PRE>   Max no. of Connections to a single host:  1
   Max no. of Messages sent in a connection: 100

</PRE></OL>Note Check with your Internet service provider to make sure the receiving
host can accept 100 messages in a single connection.
<P>
1.10 Double-byte Character Set (DBCS) Support
<P>
With the release of Microsoft Exchange Server, all versions accept and can
administer all other versions. This includes full support of Far East and
Eastern European character sets.
<P>
