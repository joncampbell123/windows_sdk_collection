The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
You might receive the following error message when you run the Microsoft
Exchange Server Setup program:
<P>
<PRE>   While attempting to start the MS Exchange System Attendant service, the
   following error occurred:

   The service did not start due to a logon failure
   MS Win NT 0xc002042d

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
There are two reasons why this error might occur:

<UL><LI>When the Microsoft Exchange Service Account was created, the checkbox
   labeled User Must Change Password at Next Logon was marked. If you
   haven't logged into Windows NT using this account and reset the
   password, when the Microsoft Exchange Setup program attempts to start
   the Microsoft Exchange System Attendant service, the service will be
   asked to change the account password. The service will not know how to
   change the password and it will fail to start.

<LI>An incorrect password for the Microsoft Exchange Service Account was
   specified.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
At this point, the Microsoft Exchange Setup program will display a dialogue
prompting you to enter the correct account name and password. If you
entered an incorrect password, you can simply enter the correct one in the
dialogue box. If the checkbox was marked, you will need to use the
Microsoft Windows NT User Manager for Domains to clear the checkbox. Then
you can go back and enter the account information in the dialogue box. In
either case, once the correction has been made, the Microsoft Exchange
Setup program will be able continue.
