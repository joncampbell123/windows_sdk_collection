<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0 and 5.00
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
A white paper on ShivaRemote is located on Microsoft TechNet and can also
be found on the following World Wide Web location:
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/exchangesupport/">http://www.microsoft.com/ExchangeSupport/</A></B>

</PRE>The ShivaRemote 3.59 software (which ships with Microsoft Exchange) can be
used with the Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client to allow users to
remotely access a computer running Microsoft Exchange Server (via dial-in
to a Windows NT RAS server or Shiva LanRover). This article discusses the
necessary steps to install and configure the ShivaRemote software that
ships with Microsoft Exchange to work under Windows 3.x. (Additional
informationn on Shiva can be found in the Reference section below).
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To install ShivaRemote on Windows 3.x:

<OL><P><LI>Select the ShivaRemote component during Microsoft Exchange client Setup;
   this will install the Shiva Setup program.

<P><LI>Run the Shiva Setup program from the icon located in the Microsoft
   Exchange program group.

<P><LI>Install and configure ShivaRemote Dial-In Driver and protocols (Shiva's
   software configuration notes, CONFIG.HLP, have additional information).
<P>
</OL>Shiva is not installed by default; however, when a typical installation is
performed, an icon for setting up ShivaRemote is created in the Exchange
program group. This Setup program for the Windows 3.x version of
ShivaRemote modifies the Autoexec.bat, Win.ini, and System.ini files.
<P>
Note: The ShivaRemote setup icon that is added to the Microsoft Exchange
Windows 3.x client program group only adds the DIAL.386 driver to the
System.ini; some manual  steps are necessary.
<P>
ShivaRemote Setup copies all of its files to the directory ShivaRemote
is being installed into, except for VNB.386 and CTL3D.DLL. These two
files are copied to the \&lt;Windir&gt;\System directory.
<P>
<P><h3>Configuration of ShivaRemote</h3>
 
<P>
To configure ShivaRemote for use with the Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x
client:

<OL><P><LI>Test the modem connection from Terminal.exe to ensure the modem
   itself is able to dial out and to verify the proper comm port.
<P>
   For more information about using terminal to test your modem, see the
   following article from the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../win3x/q105940.htm">Q105940</A></B>
<PRE></PRE>      TITLE     : Troubleshooting Serial Port Problems in Windows [win3x]


   a.  Set up your Autoexec.bat and Config.sys as follows:

      NOTE: the Novell client software must be licensed from Novell.

      Config.sys
      ----------
      device=c:\dos\setver.exe
      device=c:\dos\himem.sys
      device=c:\dos\emm386.exe noems
      shell=c:\dos\command.com /p
      dos=high,umb
      lastdrive=z

      autoexec.bat
      ------------
      lsl
      c:\exchange_dir\dialodi.exe
      ipxodi
      vlm (or netx)

      The net.cfg (nwclient directory)
      --------------------------------
       preferred server=servername
       Link Driver DIALODI

   b. Ensure you receive no error messages when booting with the newly
      configured Autoexec.bat and Config.sys.

</PRE><P><LI>Install the Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client software. (Run Setup
   from the Microsoft Exchange 3.x client compact disc or from a
   sharepoint).
<P>
   Select Custom install and verify that Shiva is selected. (Setup will
   create a "ShivaRemote setup" icon in the Microsoft Exchange Program
   group).

<P><LI>If possible, verify a valid exchange mailbox/account exists while
   connected to the LAN.  (start the Exchange client, create a profile and
   make sure you can log on to your mailbox and send a piece of mail to
   yourself).

<P><LI>Run "ShivaRemote setup" from the Microsoft Exchange Program group.

<P><LI>Click OK to install ShivaRemote.

<P><LI>Select the port and your specific modem manufacturer/model.

<P><LI>Specify a Description, Dial-in-Name (NT account that has been granted
   dial-in access on the server), Password (Password for the NT Account
   you are dialing in on), and Phone number.

<P><LI>Dial the computer running RAS. (Microsoft Exchange is supported dialing
   into either a computer running Windows NT Server with RAS or a Shiva
   LanRover).
<P>
   (For additional server configuration information, see the Reference
<P><PRE>    section below.)
</PRE>
<P><LI>Once connected, minimize ShivaRemote Connect.

<P><LI>Start the Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client. Enter the User Name
   (Exchange Mailbox Name), the Password (Windows NT Domain Password), and
   the Domain (Windows NT Domain Name that your Account is in) and verify
   you can be properly logged in.
<P>
</OL>If the above step allows you to properly send/receive mail, ShivaRemote and
Microsoft Exchange are configured correctly.
<P>
The Exchange Client remote capabilities can now be configured (remote mail
or offline folders).
<P>
To set up the Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client to automatically dial:

<OL><P><LI>In Control Panel/Mail-Fax, select the properties for Exchange Server
   in the profile and on the "Dial-Up Networking" tab.

<P><LI>Select the Shiva connection name that was tested in step 1 under "dial
   using the following connection."

<P><LI>Type the user name, password, and domain name in the dialog box.
<P>
</OL>The Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client can be started offline and when
either remote mail/connect or "sync this folder" is selected, ShivaRemote
will dial and transmit necessary information (depending on which option you
select).
<P>
<P><h3>Possible Error Messages :</h3>
 

<UL><LI>Warning: Your IPX network number changed during connection. IPX services
   may not function properly.
<P>
</UL>If you receive this error in the Exchange DOS client, simply press the
Enter key and continue.
<P>
If you are using the Exchange client for Windows 3.x or Windows for
Workgroups 3.x, the IPX network number assigned to your computer may have
changed while you were connected to the remote access server. This can
happen if you dial-in to two different remote networks in one session
without restarting your computer between connections.
<P>
If you are using the Novell NetWare VLMs Version 1.2 or later and
ShivaRemote 3.5, you can ignore this error message, and your IPX-dependent
software will function without errors. (Later versions of the VLMs have
been designed to handle this problem correctly.) This warning message can
be turned off by editing the SREMOTE.INI file and changing the following
line:
<P>
<PRE>   [Options]
   NotifyIPXAddress=No

</PRE></OL>If you are not using the NetWare VLMs, or if you are using VLMs prior to
Version 1.2, close the Dial-In connection and restart your computer, then
dial-in to the remote network again.

<UL><LI>The MS Exchange directory service could not be opened. A network error
   has occurred. Quit and restart MS Exchange. Microsoft Exchange for MS-
   DOS ID no: 5866-80040115.
<P>
</UL>To resolve this issue, test RPCs over the connection by running
"rpings.exe" (located on the Exchange server CD in the Support directory)
on the Exchange Server and rpingdos.exe on the DOS client machine. If you
are loading dialodi.exe, VLM or NETX must also be loaded, even though you
are not connecting to the LAN.
<P>

web page at www.shiva.com under "support"/modem scripts.
<P>
