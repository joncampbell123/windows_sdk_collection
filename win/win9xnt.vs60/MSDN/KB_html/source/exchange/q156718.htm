The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0 and 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0 and 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Exchange Windows 95 client, versions 4.0 and 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Exchange Macintosh client, versions 4.0 and 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When a message with an attachment is received by the Microsoft Exchange
client and the attachments have generic icons, trying to open them results
in problems.
<P>
With the Windows and Macintosh clients, an error message may appear:
<P>
<PRE>   No associated application.

</PRE>With the Macintosh client only, a compose note opens.
<P>
However, if you drag the same attachment to the Inbox as a FreeDoc, the
attachment picks up the correctly associated icon (that is, Word) and opens
fine. If you drag the FreeDoc to a message window, it loses the correct
icon again and can no longer be opened.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
This typically occurs with long filename attachments. You should be able to
work around the problem by sending the attachment with the correct
extension.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This functionality is by design.
<P>
MORE INFORMATION
 
<P>
FreeDocs determine the filetype by:

<UL><LI>Checking to see if the file is an IStorage (more commonly known as 'OLE
   DocFile'). If it is an IStorage, the CLSID embedded in it is pulled out.
   Using the CLSID, the Microsoft Exchange client looks in the registry to
   see whether it can determine an icon for this file. In more cases than
   not, there is some clue in the registry about where an icon can be
   pulled out.

<LI>If the file is not an IStorage, the Microsoft Exchange client makes a
   call, passing the file name, to get the file information and to request
   an icon for it. Typically, this function just works off the extension.
<P>
</UL>The file attachment code uses only the second of these methods.
