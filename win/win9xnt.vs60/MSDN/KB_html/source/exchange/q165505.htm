<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server versions 4.0 and 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In some cases it may be necessary to access the Microsoft Exchange Server
Internet Mail Service (IMS; in version 4.0, it is called the Internet Mail
Connector [IMC]) and/or the Microsoft Exchange Connector for Lotus cc:Mail
queues that are located within the Message Store. This article shows you
how to access the queues and how to delete mail from them using the
Microsoft Exchange MDB Viewer Utility.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To view and/or delete messages in the MTS-IN and MTS-OUT queues:

<OL><P><LI>Log on as the service account to the server running the IMC or the CCMC.

<P><LI>Run ProfInst to create a profile with a unique name (for example,IMC or
   ccmc.) ProfInst can be obtained from the BackOffice Software Development
   Kit (SDK) version 2.0 or greater in the BIN\I386 directory. The
   following are the parameters for running this utility. NOTE: enter
   GATEWAY for the /Type= parameter.
<P>
<P><PRE>      MAPI Profile Installation sample.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      USAGE: PROFINST [Flags]
</PRE><P>
<PRE>        Required Flags
        /SERVICE=    Service name (MSExchangeIMC or MSExchangeCCMC)
        /NAME=    Profile name
        /TYPE=    Profile type (GATEWAY or AGENT)

        Optional Flags
        /DELETE   Delete profile
        /HELP or /?  Display help

   You now have a MAPI profile that can be used by any MAPI client. The MDB
   Viewer utility is a MAPI client that will give you full access to the
   MTS-IN and MTS-OUT directories. The executable file is called
   Mdbvu32.exe, and is located on both the Standard and Enterprise edition
   of Microsoft Exchange Server in the \Support\Utils\I386 directory. The
   utility can be run directly from the CD-ROM. These remaining steps
   outline the process of using MDB Viewer to access the MTS-IN and MTS-OUT
   queues and to delete a message.

</PRE><P><LI>Start MDB View and select MAPI_Explicit_PROFILE and click OK. Note: If
   the option to choose a profile is not present when starting MDB View,
   shut down and restart Windows NT Server. Then start MDB View again and
   the profile option should be available.

<P><LI>Select the profile name you created in Step 2. On the MDB menu, click
   Open Message Store. From the Store Display Name pane, select the
<P><PRE>    Internet Mail Connector (Server) or the Connector for cc:Mail (Server)
    display name and click Open.
</PRE>
<P><LI>On the MDB menu, click Open Root Folder. You will now see the MTS-IN and
   MTS-OUT folders on the Child Folders Window. Select the MTS-OUT or MTS-
   IN Child Folder pane and in the Messages in Folder pane you will see any
   messages that exist in that queue.

<P><LI>To delete a message, select the message you want to delete from the
   Message In Folder pane. In the Operations Available box, select the
   lpFLD-&gt;DeleteMessages(). Click the Call Function button and confirm the
   deletion by clicking OK. The message should now be deleted.
