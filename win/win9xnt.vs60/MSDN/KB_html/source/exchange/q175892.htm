<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you are running Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5 with the Outlook
Web Access (OWA) component, various permissions need to be set for OWA to
work properly. This article defines those Exchange and Windows NT
permissions.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Outlook Web Access uses the Microsoft Internet Information Server with
Active Server Pages to grant users access to their mailbox and calendar
through a Web browser. There are three areas of permissions to be set up to
make this work correctly:
<P>
- Everyone in the Windows NT domain. Everyone must be granted "Access this
<PRE>   computer from the network" and "Log on locally" permissions through User
   Manager for Domains. Everyone also requires Search permission at the
   Exchange Site Container.

   NOTE: EXCHANGE SEARCH PERMISSIONS FOR EVERYONE AND THE ANONYMOUS ACCOUNT
   ONLY NEED TO BE SET IF SEARCH PERMISSIONS ARE USED IN YOUR ORGANIZATION
   AT OR BELOW THE SITE CONTAINER LEVEL. IF SEARCH PERMISSIONS ARE NOT
   BEING USED, DO NOT SET THIS PROPERTY, BECAUSE IT MAY HAVE ADVERSE SIDE
   EFFECTS ON DIRECTORY ACCESS.

   Please refer to the Microsoft Knowledge Base or your Microsoft Exchange
   Server Administrator's Guide for additional information regarding the
   Exchange Search permission.

</PRE>- Directory Anonymous Account. The Anonymous account is specified at the
<PRE>   Directory Site Configuration object on the General page. This account
   must have Search permissions at the Exchange Configuration container.

</PRE>- The account used by the Internet Information Service (IIS). This account
<PRE>   must have "Log on locally" and "Access this computer from the network"
   rights specified.

   IIS must be configured to allow Anonymous logon, and Basic (Clear Text)
   should be set as the authentication method.

</PRE>- Verify that the permissions on the Exchsrvr/Webdata directory and all of
<PRE>   it's sub-directories are set to READ and that the permissions on the 
   Exchsrvr/Webtemp directory and all of it's sub-directories are set to
   CHANGE.
