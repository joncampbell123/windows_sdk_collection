<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program and attempt to
get properties on a newly created public folder, you may receive the
following error:
<P>
<PRE>   The object cannot be found in the directory. This may be because
   replication has not completed.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Client operations on the public folder, such as moving messages to the
public folder, will be successful. However, this error indicates that the
public folder does not have a directory object. This can happen when a
special container created to house public folders is later deleted. In this
case, the information store object for the public folder is created, but
the directory object is not.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
In the Exchange Administrator program, you must re-create the Recipients
container that was defined as the Public Folder container. If you do not
know the name of this container, you can determine it by following these
steps:

<OL><P><LI>Start the Exchange Administrator program in Raw mode (Admin /R).

<P><LI>Highlight the Configuration container, and in the right pane select
   the Information Store Site Configuration container.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Raw Properties.

<P><LI>In the List Attributes of Type box, select All.

<P><LI>In the Object Attributes list, select Folder Container.

<P><LI>The Attribute Value listed is the name you require for the Public
   Folder container.

<P><LI>Now recreate the Recipients container by opening the File menu,
   selecting New Other, and then selecting Recipients Container.
<P>
</OL>This should automatically populate the Public Folder container entry in the
Information Store Site Configuration properties. This will allow you to get
properties of the public folder.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
