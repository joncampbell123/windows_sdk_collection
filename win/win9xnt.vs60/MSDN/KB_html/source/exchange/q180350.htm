The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you start Performance Monitor and connect to a remote Microsoft
Exchange Server computer, the number of handles open on the server
increases. When you quit Performance Monitor, the number of handles open on
the server decreases, but it may still be higher than before you connected
to the server. If you repeatedly start and quit Performance Monitor
remotely, the increase in the number of open handles may be significant.
<P>
This problem also occurs with other programs that are used to remotely
monitor the performance of a Microsoft Exchange Server computer. The
problem does not occur when you use Performance Monitor locally.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When a program connects to the registry on a remote server to obtain
information about the server's performance, multiple handles are opened by
one or more Microsoft Exchange Server dynamic-link libraries (DLLs). When
the connection ends, the DLLs do not properly close the handles.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To prevent this problem from occurring, use Performance Monitor locally
instead of remotely.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5.
A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested
and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem.
Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix.
Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When a program connects to a remote registry to obtain performance
information, it uses a different method than it uses to connect to the
local registry. The problem described in this article only occurs when the
remote method is used.
