<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
There may be a few cases where you would like to send the information in a
Microsoft Exchange form to another user without having the graphics of the 
form displayed when reading the form. For these cases you can create a 
textized Microsoft Exchange form that will only send the text of the form, 
this may be useful if you were sending the form to a user on a Macintosh 
that cannot read the graphical form.
<P>

So, how can I create a custom form with EFD and tell the form that the
message to be transferred should be in a plain text format? This can be
done by sending the form as an IPM.Note message class. Following these steps
will achieve that functionality:

<OL><P><LI>While creating the form in the Microsoft Exchange Electronic Forms Designer
   (EFD), open the View menu and select Window Properties.
</OL>2. Click the Menus tab.
3. Click File in the Menu drop down.
4. Click Send in the Commands window.
5. A button for Submit Option will now be available. Click this button to
<PRE>   get a dialog box for Submit options.
</PRE></OL>6. Select Other in the Submit By dialog and choose IPM.Note.
7. Check the checkbox Show Fields as Text in the Message.
<P>
The following is an example of a textized donation form sent as IPM.Note message
class:
<P>
<PRE>   To:   John Doe
   Cc:
   Subject:    Donation sent as text

   Charity: Main Street Theatre
   Amount: $100.00
   [ ] Matching Contribution
   [X] Annual Payroll Deduction
   Special Considerations:
   This is the text entered into the Special Consideration text box.
