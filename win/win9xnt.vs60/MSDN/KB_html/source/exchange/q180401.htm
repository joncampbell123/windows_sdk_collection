<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how to set up intersite directory replication when
the site addressing of a site is changed from the default.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Intersite directory replication takes place by means of the Microsoft
Exchange Directory Service on the bridgehead server in each site sending
messages to the directory service on the bridgehead server in the other
site. The messages are actually delivered to the other site by the message
transfer agent (MTA). The address to which the directory service sends
these messages is determined by looking at the Connected Sites page in the
properties of the connector between the two sites.
<P>
Hence if the site address of a site is changed, the information provided on
the Connected Sites pages of all connectors that connect to that site must
also be changed.
<P>
For example, consider two Microsoft Exchange sites, Site1 and Site2,
connected via a X.400 Connector. The X.400 Site Address of Site1 is changed
on the Site Addressing page of the Site Addressing object.
<P>
In order for directory replication between Site1 and Site2 to complete, in
Site2 the X.400 address on the Connected Sites page of the Connector to
Site1 must be changed to be exactly the same as the X.400 address in the
Site Addressing page of the Site Addressing object of Site1. If these
addresses do not match, directory service messages sent from Site2 to Site1
will be returned as non-deliverable.
<P>
The above information is true no matter what the connector is between the
two sites. However, if directory replication is being done between sites,
using the Internet Mail Connector (Internet Mail Service in versions 5.0
and 5.5), the SMTP address specified on the Connected Sites page of the
Internet Mail Connector in Site2 should be exactly the same as the SMTP
address in the Site Addressing page of the Site Addressing object of Site1.
