<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After using MTAcheck to validate Exchsrvr\Mtadata, the Microsoft Exchange
Server MTA service may not start, reporting an error on an invalid object.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
MTAcheck incorrectly "awakens" invalid objects, due to a missing case
statement.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0.
This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange 4.0 U.S.
Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In addition to resolving the invalid objects, this bug fix also added two
command-line parameters to MTAcheck: /RD and /RP. These parameters are
useful if you have inadvertently flooded the MTA with directory replication
and public folder replication messages, preventing e-mail messages from
being processed. Given time, the MTA will eventually work through all the
messages.
<P>
This circumstance may occur if you configure your replication connectors to
replicate very frequently, or to resynchronize with all other servers
several times during a short period of time. This circumstance may also
occur if several servers are down and unable to accept messages.
<P>
To permanently rectify this situation, reconfigure your replication
connectors, and ensure that all servers are up. /RD removes any messages in
Exchsrvr\Mtadata that are directory replication messages. /RP removes any
messages in Exchsrvr\Mtadata that are public folder replication messages.
Using these command-line parameters will affect the directories and public
folders across your Microsoft Exchange Server organization.
<P>
If the directory replication messages are removed, the directory thinks
that updates have been sent when they actually were not. The next time
servers ask for updates, each directory will realize that the previous
updates did not get assimilated, and will send the earlier updates again.
This may result in a flood of replication messages to the MTA again. To
avoid this, reconfigure your replication connectors so that replication
messages are staggered throughout the day or night.
<P>
If public folder replication messages are removed, the other public folders
will request backfill to bring all replicas to a consistent state. If there
is a large amount of public folder replication messages to many replicas,
this may again result in many messages going through the MTA. To avoid
this, reconfigure you public folder replication schedule to selected times,
to evenly distribute the load on the MTA.
