The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 and 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Attachments on incoming messages from a Hewlett-Packard (HP) OpenMail X.400
connector may include a Winmail.dat attachment if the Microsoft Exchange
Server Message Transfer Agent (MTA) is build 995.17 or higher. HP OpenMail
can use Microsoft Mail clients with an HP MAPI driver.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The remote system may be sending the Winmail.dat as an FTBP of type
mapiAttachment. This is the same value being used for attached files.
Normally, the Winmail.dat file is tagged as type TNEF. When the MTA sees
the mapiAttachment tag, it assumes it is just another bodypart, and handles
it accordingly. If the bodypart was tagged as type TNEF, the MTA would
parse it out and use the details inside.
<P>
MapiAttachment uses the OID 0x2a864886f714030a02
<P>
TNEF uses the OID 0x2a864886f714030a01
<P>
The OID can be seen in the ASN.1 parsed data in the attribute
P2_RegisteredIdentifier. Microsoft provides an ASN.1 parser in the
BackOffice Resource Kit called Aspirin.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Configure the HP OpenMail MAPI driver to not generate a Winmail.dat file on
outgoing messages. This is done in the Msmail.ini file, in the following
section:
<P>
<PRE>   [OpenDesk Transport]
   EncodeAttachInfo=1

</PRE>If EncodeAttachInfo is "0", the Winmail.dat file will not be generated. If
it is a "1", the Winmail.dat file will be generated.
<P>
If the workaround is impractical to implement, see the status section for a
possible resolution.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server,
version 4.0.
A supported fix is now available but has not been fully regression-tested
and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem.
The fix for these symptoms will also resolve any attachment issues you may
be experiencing with incoming MAPI0 Winmail.dat files. Unless you are
severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you
wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft
Technical Support for more information.
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service
Pack for Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on
obtaining the service pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base (without the spaces):
