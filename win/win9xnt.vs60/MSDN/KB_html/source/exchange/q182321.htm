<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The Windows NT Event Viewer may display the following:
<P>
<PRE>   Event ID: 1025
   Source: MSExchangeIS Private | Public
   Type: Warning
   Category:
   Description: An error occurred.
   Function name of description of problem: ecGetRestriction

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs because search folders are created and added multiple
times to the backlinks list of the folder(s) being searched. When the
search folder is deleted, the additional entries of this search folder are
not removed from the backlinks list.
<P>
When items change in this folder, the folder tries to notify the members of
the backlinks list so the search folders can be updated.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
versions 5.0 and 5.5. A supported fix is now available, but has not been
fully regression-tested and should be applied only to systems experiencing
this specific problem.  Unless you are severely impacted by this specific
problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that
contains this fix. Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more
information.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
There are two types of folders--search folders and normal folders. Search
folders are the folders created by clients when they perform a search of a
folder and its subfolders. The search folder contains information such as
the folders being searched, the messages that meet the conditions, and so
on.
<P>
On the normal folders, there is a property called ptagSearchBackLinks that
contains the name of all search folders that are referencing this normal
folder. When items change in the folder (messages are added, modified, or
deleted), the folder must notify the search folder through the
ptagSearchBAckLinks lists.
<P>
The problem is that when these search folders are created (the client does
a Tools/Find), the search folder is added to the ptagSearchBAckLinks more
than once. However, when the search folders are deleted (the client closes
the Tools/Find dialog), the folders are not removed from the
ptagSearBackLinks the same number of times that they were added. Now when
the items in the normal folders change, they attempt to notify a search
folder that does not exist, and the 1025 Event ID is generated.
