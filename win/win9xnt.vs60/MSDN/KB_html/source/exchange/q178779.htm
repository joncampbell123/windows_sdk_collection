The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you upgrade from the beta version of Exchange Server 5.5 to the
released version, you may receive and unexpected setup error -1011. This
translates into a JET_errOutOfMemory error.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when Performance Optimizer is run against a beta
install of Exchange Server 5.5. With Jet97 and Dynamic Buffer Allocation,
Performance Optimizer allocates a large number of buffers. During the
upgrade process when XJet is initialized, XJet reads the registry setting
set by Performance Optimizer for Jet97 and attempts to immediately allocate
the large number of buffers. Due to the lack of memory, XJet can not
allocate this many buffers at once, and the upgrade process fails with
a -1011 (JET_errOutOfMemory).
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor
can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.
<P>
To work around this problem, change the value to 20000 for the following
registry key:
<P>
HKLM\CCS\Services\MSExchangeIS\ParametersSystem\Buffers
<P>
It is important to re-run Performance Optimizer after the upgrade to reset
this value for Jet97.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
