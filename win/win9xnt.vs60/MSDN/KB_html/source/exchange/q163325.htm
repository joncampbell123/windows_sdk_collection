The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0 and 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it
if a problem occurs. For information on how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" online Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry
Key" online Help topic in Regedt32.exe.
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Evo.log file is a non-localized, textual copy of the MSExchangeMTA
events that are logged to the Windows NT Application Event Log. The
categories and levels of events written are controlled as for the standard
binary Application Event logs.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Setting the Text Event Log registry value to 1 will generate Ev*.log files
in the Exchsrvr\Mtadata directory. The current log is always named Evo.log.
Prior logs are named Ev&lt;number&gt;.log with the number increasing with the age
of the log. When a log reaches 5 MB in size it is renamed and a new log is
begun. If, after the MTA is stopped, it is then restarted the current
Evo.log file will be overwritten with a new zero-byte file. Any logged data
will be lost unless the file was saved or renamed.
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall Windows. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be
solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and
Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" online Help
topics in Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before
you edit it.
<P>
To edit the registry so that Text Event Logging is turned on:

<OL><P><LI>Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe or Regedit.exe, as appropriate for
   your version of Windows NT).

<P><LI>Go to the following key in the registry:
<P>
   HKEY_LOCAL_ SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeMTA
   \Parameters\

<P><LI>On the Edit menu, click Add Value and use the following entry:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Value Name: Text Event Log
      Data Type: REG_DWORD
<PRE></PRE>      Value:      1

</PRE><P><LI>Exit Registry Editor.
<P>
</OL>Evo.log files are often easier to read, search, and clip from when
troubleshooting Exchange Server message transfer agent (MTA) issues than
the corresponding Application Event Log. Evo.log files do use more
technical vocabulary, though, than the Application Event Log.
