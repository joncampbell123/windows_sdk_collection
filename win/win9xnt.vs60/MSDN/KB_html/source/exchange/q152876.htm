The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After you delete one of the Microsoft Exchange Connectors (X.400, Site, or
Dynamic RAS), the Microsoft Exchange Message Transfer Agent (MTA) might
hang.
<P>
This is usually followed by an event in the Windows NT Application Log:
<P>
<PRE>  MSExchangeMTAEvent ID 9405

  An unexpected error has occurred which may cause the MTA to terminate.
  Error: Exception c0000005 occurred at Address 206bc86. [BASE OPERATOR 22]
  (16)

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Exchange Server version 4.0 might develop a problem when
connectors are deleted. When a connector is deleted, the information should
be passed along to a storage area pending deletion by a Microsoft Exchange
background cleanup routine. However, this does not happen. The deleted
object is left as an Entry Control Block (ECB) that can be interpreted by
the system as an active object. This in turn can result in the above error.
<P>
This problem is most often experienced after deleting multiple connectors
at a time, however, it can be seen after deleting only one connector.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange version
4.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange Server
U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on
