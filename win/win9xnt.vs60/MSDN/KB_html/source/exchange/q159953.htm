The information in this article applies to: 

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0 and 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
SYMPTOMS 
======== 
<P>
The following warning from the Microsoft Exchange Client might appear after 
a Microsoft Exchange Administrator performs a move mailbox operation:
<P>
<PRE>   The folder could not be opened. You do not have sufficient permission to
   perform this operation on this object. See the folder contact or your
   system administrator.

</PRE>CAUSE
===== 
<P>
Your mailbox was moved to another Microsoft Exchange Server in the Microsoft
Exchange Site while you were logged on in your Microsoft Exchange Client. 
<P>
WORKAROUND 
========== 
<P>
Microsoft Exchange administrators should verify that all clients are logged 
off of their Microsoft Exchange Server prior to the move mailbox operation. 
If a user is logged on to the mailbox during the move operation and 
encounters the above warning, they should exit and loggoff and their client 
will function normally the next time it is started. 
<P>
MORE INFORMATION 
 
<P>
Microsoft recommendeds that mail be sent prior to the move mailbox operation 
so that users will have fair warning of the impending move.
