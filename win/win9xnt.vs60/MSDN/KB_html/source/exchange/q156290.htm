<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you install a Microsoft Exchange Electronic Forms Designer (EFD)
project file (*.efp file), the computer may stop responding, or a general
protection fault (GPF) may occur. The only way to get back into Exchange
Forms Designer at this point is to end task from Task Manager and restart.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs during the project installation and compile
processand
is due to an out of memory error. The out of memory error is caused in
turn
by the number of controls placed on and Exchange Form during design time.
The number of controls is not limited during design time but the number
that can be present while installing or compiling an Exchange Forms
Project
file is limited to a number between 80 to 120. This number varies due to
the different memory requirements of each control.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Before installing, limit the number of controls present in an Exchange
Forms project file to approximately 80 controls.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange
versions
4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
