The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0
 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After you migrate an X.400 Microsoft Mail Personal Address Book (PAB) entry
that contains a dollar sign ($)in the DDA value field and then try to send
a message to this address in the Microsoft Exchange client, the message may
not be delivered. Something similar to the following is returned to the
originator:
<P>
<PRE>   From: System Administrator
   Sent: Tuesday, November 5, 1996 12:16 PM
   Subject: Undeliverable: test using migrated PAB address

   Your message did not reach some or all of the intended recipients.

         Subject:test using migrated PAB address
         Sent:11/5/96 12:16:08 PM

   The following recipient(s) could not be reached:

         'X.400' on 11/5/96 12:16:12 PM
               The message was undelivered because the specified recipient
   postal address was incorrect
               MSEXCH:MSExchangeIS:SITE:SERVER

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
A dollar sign, which was used in Microsoft Mail to signify that the
preceding character should not be treated as a delimiter, is not a valid
character to be used in a DDA value, according to the CCITT (ITU) X.400
specifications (see More Information for more details). The preliminary
check of the address by the Microsoft Exchange Information Store correctly
uncovers the invalid character and returns the message to the originator as
undeliverable.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem:

<UL><LI>Remove the dollar sign from all DDA values in the PAB before performing
   the migration.
<P>
</UL>-or-

<UL><LI>Edit the PAB in the Microsoft Exchange client after the migration
   process is complete and remove the dollar sign.
<P>
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
During the migration process, when the dollar sign is encountered it is
replaced with a forward slash mark or solidus (/).  For example, an address
that had the following format in Microsoft Mail
<P>
<PRE>  /c=us/admd=attmail/dda.type=id/dda.value=fax(b)7135466286($/User One)

</PRE>is migrated as follows into the Microsoft Exchange client PAB:
<P>
<PRE>  /c=us/admd=attmail/dda.type=id/dda.value=fax(b)7135466286(//Pete Petree)

</PRE>NOTE: The Microsoft Exchange Information Store treats a single forward
slash mark in a DDA value as delimiter; therefore, a double forward slash
needs to be used to send the message. Please see the following for more
information:

ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../exchange/q159291.htm">Q159291</A></B>
<PRE>TITLE     : XADM: Single Forward Slash Treated as Delimiter in DDA Value

</PRE>The CCITT (ITU) 1988 Blue Book X.208, Table 5 defines the Printable
Character set as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   Capital letters A, .. Z
   Small letters a, .. z
   Digits 0, .. 9
   Space
   Apostrophe '
   Left paren(
   Right paren )
   Plus sign+
   Comma ,
   Hyphen -
   Full stop .
   Solidus /
   Colon :
   Equal sign =
   Question mark ?

</PRE>A DDA value field can only contain a printable string.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>

4.0.
