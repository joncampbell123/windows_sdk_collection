<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
With the Microsoft Exchange Active Server Components (also known as the Web
Connector), you can use a web browser to access your private mailbox, as
well public folder discussions and directory information. Developers can
also easily build interactive web-based applications using the rich data
storage and directory and messaging capabilities of Microsoft Exchange
Server. These applications enable developers to make ordinary web pages
more rich, interactive, and compelling by adding Microsoft Exchange
services such as a threaded discussion. (See the Microsoft Web site at
<B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/exchange/http.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/exchange/http.htm</A></B> for more background
information).
<P>
This article outlines known limitations of the Microsoft Exchange Active
Server Components.

<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Known limitations of the Microsoft Exchange Active Server Components are:

<UL><LI>Attachments can only be sent provided the following requirements are met:
<P>
<P><PRE>      1. Microsoft Exchange Server must be at Service Pack 1 or higher.
      2. The Microsoft Internet Explorer must be version 3.02 or higher.
      3. The File Upload add-on for Microsoft Internet Explorer must be
<PRE></PRE>         applied to the browser.
      4. The MAC version of Microsoft Internet Explorer must be 3.01a or
         higher.
      5. The version of Netscape Navigator must be 3.02 or greater.

      Note: The File Upload add-on only needs to be applied to the Windows
            versions of Microsoft Internet Explorer.

</PRE><LI>Scheduling information cannot currently be viewed. This is a planned
   feature for a future version.

<LI>When logging on to the browser, you get no notification if the Out-Of-
   Office assistant is turned on.

<LI>Display names are not accepted in the logon.asp Log On page. You must
   enter the mailbox name [alias] as it appears from the Microsoft Exchange
   Server Administrator program.

<LI>Unread message count is not displayed.

<LI>Windows NT Domain passwords cannot be changed.

<LI>You cannot open other individuals' mailboxes.

<LI>There is currently no forms support. However, Outlook server-based

   These are Outlook forms and will appear as messages in the Active Server
   Components.

<LI>Folders cannot be renamed when using the Web client. For additional
