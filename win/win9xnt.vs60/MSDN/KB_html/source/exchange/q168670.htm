<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you are running the Microsoft Exchange Connector for Lotus cc:Mail,
you may find that messages are stuck in MTS-OUT queue of the connector
store. As a result, messages destined to cc:Mail do not go through, but
messages flow fine from cc:Mail to Exchange Server. In the application log,
you receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Event ID: 59 Source: MSExchangeCCMC Category: General
   Lotus cc:Mail IMPORT from file *.ccm returned result code 1. Program
   did not complete successfully.

</PRE>This is a generic error message from the cc:Mail import program. You
may notice there are files in the Exchsrvr\Ccmcdata\Submit directory.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Exchange service account does not have sufficient permission to access
the cc:Mail Post Office database. If the cc:Mail Post Office database is
located on a Novell NetWare server and Microsoft Gateway Services for
NetWare (GSNW) is not enabled, you must created service account on the
NetWare server with the identical account information and password. The
service account should also has supervisor equivalent right on the
database.
<P>
To verify whether the issue is due to permission, you can move the cc:Mail
Post Office database to the Windows NT computer where Exchange Server is
running.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this problem:

<UL><LI>Grant appropriate trustee right for Exchange Service Account from
   NetWare.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Inbound mail (from cc:MAIL to Exchange) works fine because Exchange Server
only reads files and writes to Windows NT. But for outbound mail (when
Exchange Server writes to cc:Mail on netWare), the service account does not
have sufficient rights.
<P>
cc:Mail is manufactured by Lotus, a vendor independent of Microsoft; we
make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
performance or reliability.
