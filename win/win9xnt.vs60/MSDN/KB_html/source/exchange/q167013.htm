The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0 and 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Exchange Windows 95 client, versions 4.0 and 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0 and 5.0
</UL>

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
An SMTP address cannot be modified. This problem occurs because the
Microsoft Exchange Client was originally using a personal address book
(PAB) and connecting to a Microsoft Mail for PC Networks 3.x postoffice
when the SMTP address was created. Now, the Microsoft Exchange Client is
connecting to a Microsoft Exchange Server computer, but is using the same
PAB.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs because there are two SMTP address templates in
Microsoft Exchange Client. One is used when creating SMTP addresses with
the Microsoft Mail Provider (that is, using Microsoft Exchange Client with
the Microsoft Mail service). The second template is used when creating SMTP
addresses with the Microsoft Exchange Provider (that is, using Microsoft
Exchange Client with the Microsoft Exchange service). The SMTP addresses
created with the Microsoft Mail Provider become read-only when the
Microsoft Mail Provider is no longer in use.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, re-create the address in the new Microsoft
Exchange SMTP template form. You can do this by performing the following
steps:

<OL><P><LI>Open the old SMTP address.
</OL>2. Copy the entire SMTP address.
3. Open a new SMTP address.
4. Paste the SMTP address, copied in step 2 above.
5. Delete the old SMTP address.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If you export and import the PAB, the same template information will be
imported along with the SMTP address. There is no way to change the
template information from a Microsoft Mail template to a Microsoft Exchange
template other than to manually recreate the SMTP address entries when
using the Microsoft
Exchange Service Provider.
