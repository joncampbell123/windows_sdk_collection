<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
You may experience the following behavior when using the Outlook Web Access
(OWA) client with Internet Explorer to open a Freedoc file that has an .Rtf
extension and is located in a Microsoft Exchange Server folder:

<OL><P><LI>You are prompted to open the file or save it to disk. If you choose to
   open it, you are prompted with the Open With dialog box in order to
   associate the specified file extension with an application:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Click the program you want to use to open the file 'frmRoot.XXX'.
      If the program you want is not in the list, click Other.
</PRE><P>
   ...where XXX is a randomly generated file extension.

<P><LI>You choose an application, such as Winword. NOTE: Do not choose the
   "Always use this program to open this file" option. If you do, the
   random file extension will be permanently associated with the
   application you selected. If you choose Winword, Microsoft Word starts
   and you receive the following error message:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Word cannot open the document.
      Try one or more of the following:
      - On the FIle menu, click Open to open the document.
      - Make sure the document has a .Doc extension.
      (D:\WIN95\TEMPORARY.DOC)
</PRE>
<P><LI>You click OK, and the following error message appears:
<P>
<P><PRE>      The document name or path is not valid.
      Try one or more of the following:
      - Check the path to make sure it was typed correctly.
      - On the File menu, click Open. Search for the file using the dialog
      box.
      (FILES\CACHE\FRMROOT.XXX)
</PRE><P>
   ...where XXX is a randomly generated file extension. If you click OK, a
   blank document opens in Microsoft Word.
<P>
</OL><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, open the file in Microsoft WordPad or another
text editor. Alternatively, you can choose to save the file locally and
manually add the .Rtf extension to the file from Windows Explorer. Then
open the file from Microsoft Word using the File/Open menu.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
