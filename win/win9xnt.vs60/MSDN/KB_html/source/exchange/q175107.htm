The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0 and 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0 and 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Exchange Windows 95 client, versions 4.0 and 5.0

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a
Registry  Key" Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you try to download the Offline Address Book, the following error
message may occur:
<P>
<PRE>   The directory for the local Microsoft Exchange offline address book
   files does not exist.

</PRE>If you click OK, the following message occurs:
<P>
<PRE>   Unable to download the offline Address Book. The Microsoft Exchange
   Address Book could not be accessed.

</PRE>NOTE: Only Exchange clients installed from a network share point exhibit
these symptoms.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Default.prf file on the network share point has the
OfflineAddressBookPath value set incorrectly, which causes the error
message for the profiles created from it.
<P>
The location specified in the Exchange user's profile for the Offline
Address Book files is invalid. The location of the Offline Address Book is
not configurable through the Exchange client. By default the Offline
Address Book is kept in the Windows directory.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
The following method can be used to modify the Default.prf. If the
Default.prf file is present, edit the file using a text editor such as
Notepad, and complete these steps:

<OL><P><LI>In the [Service2] section, add this entry:
<P>
   OfflineAddressBookPath= &lt;path to the offline Address Book&gt;
<P>
   If this entry already exists, modify the path to what you want.

<P><LI>Save the file, and exit out of the text editor.
<P>
</OL>New profiles created using this Default.prf will now point to the correct
location for the Offline Address Book files.
<P>
To modify an existing profile, perform the following steps:
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor
can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.
<P>
Assuming that the Offline Address Book location needs to be modified for a
profile with the name "Default Exchange Profile," use the procedure that is
appropriate for your operating system to change it.
<P>
For Windows NT:

<OL><P><LI>Run Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

<P><LI>Go to the following key:
<P>
   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\Currentversion
   \Windows Messaging Subsystem\Profiles\Default Exchange Profile

<P><LI>Open the following key:
<P>
   13dbb0c8aa05101a9bb000aa002fc45a

<P><LI>Now look for the value: 001e660e
   This should be type REG_SZ and should contain the path to OAB files.
   Modify the string associated with this value to be the new directory for
   the OAB files. If this value does not exist, then add a new value with
   the following information:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Value Name: 001e660e
      Data Type: REG_SZ
      String: &lt;Location of the OAB Files&gt;
</PRE><P>
</OL>For Windows 95:

<OL><P><LI>Run Registry Editor (Regedit.exe).

<P><LI>Go to the following key:
<P>
   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows Messaging
   Subsystem\Profiles\Default Exchange Profile

<P><LI>Open the following key:
<P>
   13dbb0c8aa05101a9bb000aa002fc45a

<P><LI>Now look for the value: 001e660e
   This should be type REG_SZ and should contain the path to OAB files.
   Modify the string associated with this value to be the new directory for
   the OAB files. If this value does not exist, then add a new value with
   the following information:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Value Name: 001e660e
      Data Type: REG_SZ
      String: &lt;Location of the OAB Files&gt;
</PRE><P>
</OL>For Windows 3.x:

<OL><P><LI>Open the Profiles.ini file and find the filename for the profile
   "Default Exchange Profile." The file name could be 5d630a00 or
   something similar.

<P><LI>Exit the editor and open the 5d630a00.ini file.

<P><LI>Locate the section with the heading [13dbb0c8aa05101a9bb000aa002fc45a].
   Look for an entry with the name, 001e660e. The value of this entry is
   the path to the OAB files. Modify the value to the location you prefer.
<P>
  If this entry does not exist, locate the section with the heading
  13dbb0c8aa05101a9bb000aa002fc45a] and add the following line to it:
<P>
<P><PRE>     001e660e=&lt;path to OAB files&gt;
</PRE>
<P><LI>Open the client again and download the Offline Address Book.
