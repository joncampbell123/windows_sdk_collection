The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use Microsoft Exchange Server, you may get messages in your inbox
stating:
<P>
<PRE>   This message was sent using a character set not supported on the
   Internet Mail Connector. The message text has been placed into the
   attachment: ATT00001.txt. To view, double-click on the attachment. If
   the text isn't displayed correctly, save the attachment to disk, and
   then use a viewer that can display the original character set.

</PRE><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
The workaround is to set the sending system to use a supported character
set, for example, ISO-8859 or US-ASCII (or something found on the Internet
Mail tab for the IMC).
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To see which character set was used in sending the message, view the
properties of the message and look on the Headers tab. Scroll down to the
bottom and find the line that looks like:
<P>
<PRE>   Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

</PRE>If the character set used to send the message to Microsoft Exchange Server
is anything other than US-ASCII, you may see this behavior. In compliance
with RFC-1521 the character set that is supported is US-ASCII.
<P>
A character set of X-roman8 or X-anything is not supported by the IMC.
<P>
Excerpt from RFC-1521:
<P>
<PRE>   No other character set name may be used in Internet mail without the
   publication of a formal specification and its registration with IANA,
   or by private agreement, in which case the character set name must
   begin with "X-".

   Implementors are discouraged from defining new character sets for
   mail use unless absolutely necessary.
