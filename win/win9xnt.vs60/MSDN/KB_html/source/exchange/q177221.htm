The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server versions 4.0, 5.0, and 5.5
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you attempt to apply a service pack to a computer running Microsoft
Exchange Server, you may receive an error message during setup that says
some files are in use, even when no other applications are running. The
error message will be similar to the following:
<P>
<PRE>   Could not open the file named 'C:\EXCHSRVR\BIN\ADDRESS.DLL'. It is in
   use by another application.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
It is possible that the system attendant is running again. Part of the
update and setup process is to first stop all known Exchange related
services, including the system attendant. However, if there is at least one
server monitor running against the server, the system attendant will be
restarted. This occurs even if:

<UL><LI>The system attendant is not set to be monitored.
<LI>The server monitor is configured to take no action.
<LI>You use ADMIN /T NR to suspend notifications and repairs.
<P>
</UL><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, stop all server monitors running against the
Exchange Server computer that is being upgraded.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
versions 4.0, 5.0, and 5.5. We are researching this problem and will post
new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
