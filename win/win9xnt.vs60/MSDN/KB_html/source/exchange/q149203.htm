<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you send mail over the Internet from a Microsoft Exchange Windows
client or an Outlook client, a file attachment called Winmail.dat may be 
added to the message. This attachment contains the Microsoft Exchange 
rich-text information of the message being sent. The Winmail.dat file 
may not be useful to non-Microsoft Exchange recipients. The information 
in the Winmail.dat file may appear on the receiving end as binary 
information at the end of the mail message.
<P>
This article describes how to prevent sending the Winmail.dat attachment to
Internet users when you are using the Microsoft Exchange Internet Mail
Connector (IMC).
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
You can control whether or not to send rich-text format in any one of the
following ways:

<OL><P><LI>Custom Recipients
   The administrator can modify an existing Microsoft Exchange custom
   recipient to prevent rich text information from being sent to that
   custom recipient by clearing the Allow Rich Text in Messages check box
   on the Advanced property page of the recipient's properties. You can
   view the custom recipient's properties by selecting the recipient name
   and then choosing Properties from the File menu.

<P><LI>Addresses in the Personal Address Book
   The user can modify the Internet addresses in their Personal Address
   Book (PAB) to not be sent rich-text information by clearing the Always
   Send to This Recipient in Microsoft Exchange Rich-Text Format check box
   on the SMTP General property page of the Internet address in the PAB. To
   obtain the properties of an entry in a PAB, select the entry and choose
   Properties from the File menu.

<P><LI>Configuring the Internet Mail Connector (IMC)
   The administrator can configure the IMC to send or not to send rich-text
   information by following the steps below:
<P>
<P><PRE>      a. Bring up the properties of the Internet Mail Connector.
      b. Select the Internet Mail property page.
      c. Click on the button labeled Interoperability. This should bring up
<PRE></PRE>         the Interoperability dialog.
      d. The Send Microsoft Exchange Rich-Text Formatting list box controls
         the sending of rich-text data. There are three values to choose
         from:
            - If the value is set to User, the recipient's properties are
              used to determine whether or not to send rich-text
              information.
            - If the value is set to Always, rich-text information is
              always sent, regardless of the recipient's properties.
            - If the value is set to Never, rich-text information is never
              sent.
   You can also configure whether or not to send rich-text information on a
   per-domain basis. To define e-mail domains and the message settings for
   that domain, click the E-Mail Domain button on the Internet Mail page of
   the IMC Properties. This will bring up the Add E-Mail Domain dialog.
   Click on the Add button to specify an e-mail domain. Click on the
   Interoperability button. Select a setting from the Send Microsoft
   Exchange rich text formatting list box.

</PRE><P><LI>One-Off Addressing
   You can send e-mail to an Internet user from a Microsoft Exchange or
   Outlook client using One-Off addressing. One-Off addressing allows 
   sending a message to addresses that are not in the PAB, the Global
   Address List (GAL), or in any recipient containers. Depending on the
   type of the One-Off address used, rich-text information is or is not
   sent with the message:
<P><PRE>      a. Rich-Text Information Sent:
<PRE></PRE>        If the One-Off address has the following format, rich-text
        information is sent with the message:

            [SMTP:&lt;SMTP Address&gt;]

         where SMTP Address is any valid SMTP address, for example:

            user@domain.com

         To verify that rich-text information is sent:

         1. Select the Check Names command from the Tools menu after typing
            the address in the above format. This should display the SMTP
            address without the SMTP:. The name should be underlined.
         2. Bring up the Properties of the address by double clicking it.
            The option Always Send to This Recipient in Microsoft Exchange
            Rich-Text Format should be checked indicating that rich-text
            information (the Winmail.dat file) will be sent along with the
            message.

      NOTE: Even if you address a message to [SMTP:&lt;SMTP Address&gt;], you can
            run the Check Names command, then get the properties of the
            resolved recipient and unselect the Always Send to This
            Recipient in Microsoft Exchange Rich-Text Format checkbox. This
            will prevent rich-text information from being sent along with
            the message.
      b. Rich-Text Information Not Sent:
         If you use a One-Off address and you do not want to send rich-text
         information to the recipient, the address should have the
         following format:

            &lt;SMTP Address&gt;

         where SMTP Address is any valid SMTP Address, for example:

            user@domain.com

      NOTE: Unlike the address in step 4.a. above, the SMTP Address is not
            proceeded by SMTP: and the address is not enclosed in square
            brackets. If you click the Check Names command and then get the
            properties of the address, you can see that the rich-text
            option is not selected.

   However, no matter what option is selected for the address of the
   recipient, the IMC settings determine whether or not rich-text
   information is transmitted. If the IMC is set to never send rich-text
   data, then even if the properties of the recipient address have the
   rich-text option selected, no rich-text is transmitted.

   If the IMC has separate settings for individual domains, then the
   settings for those domains takes precedence for all messages addressed
   to users in those domains.
