<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
MAPI allows programmers to collect information about the properties of
messages and their attachments. When an application makes a MAPI call to
retrieve properties on an attachment, and PR_ATTACH_DATA_BIN is one of the
requested properties, the call may fail with MAPI_E_NOT_ENOUGH_MEMORY. This
only occurs the attachment is 31,010 to 32,768 bytes in size (the lower
limit varies depending on what other properties are included in the
request).
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When a client does a GetProps() call, it passes a list of properties to
collect information on. The store collects the requested properties and
saves the information in a pre-allocated buffer to be returned to the
client. The size of this buffer is 32,768. As properties are collected and
saved in this buffer, the remaining free space in the buffer is updated.
When the PR_ATTACH_DATA_BIN property is processed, an attempt is made to
put the data in the buffer. Because there is insufficient space in the
buffer for the attachment data, the function collecting the data returns an
error. This error is not being processed correctly by the Information
Store.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem:

<UL><LI>Increase the size of the attachment so it does not fall within the range
   of 31,010 to 32,768 bytes.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0.
A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested
and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem.
Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix.
Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
