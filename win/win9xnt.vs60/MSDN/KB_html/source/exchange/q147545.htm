The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you send a message from a Microsoft  Exchange site over the X.400
Connector, the delivery receipts are incomplete. It contains the following:
<P>
<PRE>   Your message
   To:              Unknown
   Subject:         Unknown
   Sent:            Unknown

   was delivered to the following recipient(s):

   /o=MICROSOFT/ou=EXCHNGSITE/cn=Recipients/cn=Admin on 1/18/96 3:59:54 PM

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs if any of the following conditions are met:

<UL><LI>The X.400 Connector is set to operate in 1984 conformance mode.

<LI>The client has a local store as the default delivery location.

<LI>Clear the "Save a copy of the item in the 'Sent Items' folder" check box
   and send a message.
<P>
</UL>The X.400 specification generates reports (delivery and read) based on the
information in the messabe envelope. The envelope does not contain the TO,
SUBJECT and SENT information in the delivery report. Therefore, this
information is not returned by the X.400 system receiving the message.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To overcome this limitation of the X.400 specification, Microsoft Exchange
uses the Content Corelator attribute. When a message is sent over the
Microsoft Exchange X.400 connector, an attribute called the Content
Corelator is filled in the envelope of a message. When the X.400 system at
the other end of the X.400 Connector generates a report (delivery or read),
based on the 1988 X.400 specification, the Content Corelator attribute is
returned to the originating system.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Exchange Information Store uses the Content Corelator to scan
for a copy of the message in the Sent Items folder. If a copy is found, the
Information Store extracts the TO, SUBJECT and SENT information and is
added to the Delivery Report. If a copy is not found, "Unknown" is entered
for the TO, SUBJECT and SENT fields.
<P>
The Information Store only searches the Sent Items folder in the Server-
based Information Store. Local Stores are not searched. Therefore, if the
user has the local store set as the default delivery location, "Unknown" is
entered for the TO, SUBJECT and SENT field in the delivery receipts from
the X.400 Connector.
<P>
The 1988 X.400 specification guarantees that the Content Corelator
attribute in the envelope is returned to the sender. However, the 1984
X.400 specification does not guarantee this. Therefore, some 1984 compliant
X.400 MTAs may not return the Content Corelator attribute in delivery
reports. As a result, the Information Store on the sending side enters
"Unknown" for the TO, SUBJECT and SENT fields.
