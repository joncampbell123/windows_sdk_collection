The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Internet mail messages sent as high priority (urgent) from a Microsoft Mail
postoffice (with an SMTP access component), over the MS Mail Interchange to
a Microsoft Exchange Server computer, and then over the Internet Mail
Service, may change priority. The priority may also change if the message
travels across an X.400 connector to the Internet Mail Service.
<P>
You can see the change in priority by looking at the Internet Mail Service
queue after the mail is delivered to the Microsoft Exchange Server
computer. If the destination host is not available, the message is queued
and the expiration time is set to 48 hours, which is the default for normal
priority messages. View the message in the Imcdata\Out directory, and it
will have X-Priority set to 1 (normal). The MS Mail sender may not receive
notification messages that the message is queued for delivery, but not yet
delivered.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Internet Mail Service uses the PR_PRIORITY property from the envelope
(P1) instead of the PR_IMPORTANCE property. The Internet Mail Service bases
the calculation of expiry times on the value in PR_IMPORTANCE of the
message.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service
Pack for Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on
obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The message flow is as given below:
<P>
The MSMI creates an X.400 P1 and a message in the form of MDB Extended
Format (MDBEF), and then submits it to the MTA via X.400 API (XAPI). In
this P1 there is no PR_IMPORTANCE since it is a P2 property. PR_PRIORITY is
set in the P1 and also in the MDBEF. The information store picks this up
from the delivery queue and creates a hybrid P1, which has all the X.400 P1
properties, plus some P2 properties. Some of the selected P2 properties are
promoted into this new P1 envelope, but PR_IMPORTANCE is not one of them.
Therefore, this envelope contains the PR_IMPORTANCE, but with a default
value of Normal. This new envelope is put in the MTS-OUT queue for the
Internet Mail Service. The Internet Mail Service picks up this envelope
from the MTS-OUT and reads the properties from the envelope. The Internet
Mail Service is reading the PR_IMPORTANCE to decide the priority of the
message. Because the information store created this envelope and never
promoted the real PR_IMPORTANCE, a message with priority Normal occurs. The
PR_PRIORITY in this envelope is set to Urgent, because it was correctly
passed through from the MSMI and the information store.
<P>
For this issue, the Internet Mail Service has been changed to use the
PR_PRIORITY from the P1 instead of PR_IMPORTANCE. PR_IMPORTANCE indicates a
value to users, while PR_PRIORITY indicates the order or speed at which the
messages are sent by the messaging system software. Higher priority usually
indicates a higher cost. Higher importance usually is associated with a
different display by the user interface.
