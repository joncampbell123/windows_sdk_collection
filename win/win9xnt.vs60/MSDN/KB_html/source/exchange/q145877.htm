The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, version 4.0
 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use a network administrative setup, (setup /a), to install the
Microsoft Exchange client for Windows 3.x source files on a network drive
from a Microsoft Windows for Workgroups 3.11 workstation, you might receive
the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Setup.ini Forced to Quit product.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
You will receive one of the error messages if either of the following is
true:

<UL><LI>The Microsoft Exchange client Setup program is unable to change the
   attributes of the file to READ-ONLY. This might be because you don't
   have the appropriate write privileges to do this.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>The Microsoft Exchange client Setup program is able to change the
   attributes of the file to READ-ONLY, but the network returns the message
   that the change was not successful.
<P>
</UL><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
If you receive this error message, do the following to correct the problem:

<UL><LI>Delete the original Setup.ini from your drive.
<P>
   If you receive the error message above, restart the workstation and
   rerun the Microsoft Exchange client Setup program. If it continues to
   fail, it may be because the original Setup.ini file is still present as
   a Read-Only file. To resolve this problem, delete the original Setup.ini
   file from your hard disk.

<LI>Modify the Net.cfg or Shell.cfg files, Novell workstations only:
<P>
   1.  Locate the Shell.cfg or Net.cfg on the workstation from which you
<P><PRE>       are running the administrative setup of Office 4.0. If this file
       does not exist, create it using a text editor and place it in the
       same directory as Netx.com.
</PRE>   2. Open the Shell.cfg or Net.cfg file in a text editor. In the
<P><PRE>      DOSREQUESTER section, change the line that reads:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>         READ ONLY COMPATIBILITY=ON

         to

         READ ONLY COMPATIBILITY=OFF

      If this line does not exist, create it. The entry must be indented
      (default 3 spaces) or it will be seen as an invalid section heading
      and not be used.

      For example:

         NETWARE DOSREQUESTER
            READ ONLY COMPATIBILITY=OFF

      Read Only Compatibility = Off | On  (default Off)

      This is not a new parameter, but the default has been changed with
      release 1.20 of the DOS Requester. In the last major release of the
      Requester this parameter defaulted to On. However, this default
      setting caused problems with a number of applications, so the
      parameter is now set to Off by default.

   3. If the workstation is using the NetWare VLM shell version 1.1,
      (Netware 3.11), continue with the steps in the following section "VLM
      version 1.1". If you are not running VLM version 1.1, continue with
      steps 4-6 below.

   NOTE: In many cases, the procedure described in the section "VLM Version
         1.1" will not be required. This process is time consuming.
         Continue with steps 4 through 6 below and perform the VLM
         procedure only if the problem persists.

   4. Log off of the network, restart the workstation, and connect to the
      server again.
   5. Log on to the network, start Windows, and run setup /a from the
      client source disk to establish the client setup share point to
      install the application.
   6. When the application is installed, change the option in the Shell.cfg
      or Net.cfg file back to =ON in case there are applications on the
      system that require this setting.

</PRE><LI>VLM Version 1.1
<P>
   If you are using VLM version 1.1, you can obtain this updated version of
   the VLM shell. Novell has made these files available on CompuServe in
   the NOVFILES forum and on FTP.NOVELL.COM. VLMUP2.EXE (a self-extracting
   file) contains all the updated VMS (Pre-release v1.20), the updated ODI
   drivers(LSL.COM and IPXODI.COM), the updated Mills, and other associated
   files.
<P>
   To find the version of VLM that you are using, type the following at the
   MS-DOS prompt:
<P>
<P><PRE>      VLM /d
</PRE><P>
   If this command presents too much information at one time, type the
   following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      VLM /d | more
</PRE><P>
   If you are running VLM version 1.1, use the following steps to resolve
   this problem (Note that these steps should be taken after you complete
   the first two steps in the Modify NET.CFG or SHELL.CFG Files section
   above):
<P>
   1. Remove the VLM shell and use the NETX shell to complete the
<P><PRE>      administrative setup. If you cannot use NETX, you can install the VLM
      shell version 1.0. However, because reinstalling VLM version 1.0 is
      very time consuming, using NETX is the preferred method.
</PRE>   2. Log off of the network, restart the workstation and connect to the
<P><PRE>      server again.
</PRE>   3. Log on to the network, start Windows, and run setup /a from the
<P><PRE>      client source disk to establish the client setup share point to
      install the application.
    4. When the application is installed, change the option in the
       Shell.cfg or Net.cfg file back to =ON in case there are applications
       on the system that require this setting.
</PRE><P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
READ ONLY COMPATIBILITY is an option used by the Novell workstation
redirector, Netx.com. This option determines whether or not an attempt to
open a read-only file for write access fails. Prior to Novell network
version 2.1x, a program could open a read-only file for write access
without generating an error message. With network version 2.1 and later
versions, write access is not granted when opening a read-only file. With
the READ ONLY COMPATIBILITY option in the Shell.cfg or Net.cfg file set to
ON, the workstation redirect allows write access to a read-only file
without generating an error message.
