The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Outlook Windows 3.x client, version 8.03
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If Microsoft Exchange has been installed in a custom program group, (such
as "My Exchange Client”), instead of the default group called Microsoft
Exchange and you upgrade to Microsoft Outlook version 8.03 and choose the
same program group where Microsoft Exchange is installed, an empty program
group called Microsoft Exchange is created. Also, the old Microsoft
Exchange icons are not removed from the original program group.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Outlook for
Windows 3.x, version 8.03. We are researching this problem and will post
new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In some cases, this behavior may be desirable. Because the old Exchange
icons are not removed when the new Outlook icons are added to the old
program group, users can run either the old Exchange client or new Outlook
client, or both.
<P>
If Microsoft Outlook client is installed in the same directory as the
Exchange client, it is assumed that Microsoft Exchange will no longer be
used. Therefore, the following icons can be manually deleted from the
program group:
<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft Exchange
   MS Exchange Services
   Inbox Repair Tool
   Microsoft Exchange Setup
   ShivaRemote Setup
   Microsoft Schedule+

</PRE>The empty Microsoft Exchange program group that was created by the
Microsoft Outlook installation will also need to be deleted.
