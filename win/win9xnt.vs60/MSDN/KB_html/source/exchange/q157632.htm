The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you attempt to start the Microsoft Exchange client, the client may
temporarily stop responding or you may be prompted multiple times for
domain credentials. These credentials are for the domain where the
Microsoft Exchange site that owns the Organization Forms folder is located
(for example, let's call it Site B). The domain credentials dialog box
also appears when you attempt to open a read receipt, delivery receipt, or
non- delivery report (NDR). (For a more complete description of the
symptoms, see the More Information section below.)
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design. When the client logs on to Site A, there is an
attempt to locate a forms library and to bind to it if it exists within
the Microsoft Exchange Organization. If the only instance of the Forms
Library exists in Site B and affinity is set, the Microsoft Exchange
client attempts to connect to a server (containing the Forms Library) in
Site B.
<P>
NOTE: If no Organization Forms folder instances are available in
the Site,
but there is at least one Site available with instances, the
affinity to the Sites is used to rank the order in which connections
to the Sites will be attempted. The affinity is set on the site Public
Folder Affinity page. Clients must have RPC connectivity to the servers
in the affinity sites. Otherwise, the clients will not be able to
access the Public Folders in the other sites, even though the affinity
has been correctly set, thus causing possible client slowdown.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Do one of the following:

<UL><LI>Remove the affinity to the site that owns the Organization Forms
   folder (Site B).
<P>
</UL>-or-

<UL><LI>Create a local site instance of the Organization Forms folder by
   replicating the folder from Site B to Site A.
<P>
</UL>If an Organizations Forms folder is created within the organization,
it is recommended this folder is replicated to Sites that may not have
a physical connection (ie dial up connection) or are connected via
slow link to the Organization Forms folders Home Site.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
You will be prompted for domain credentials when all of the following
conditions are met:

<UL><LI>An Organization Forms Folder has been created.
<LI>A Public Folder Affinity has been established between the sites.
<LI>No local instance of the Organization Forms folder exists.
<P>
</UL>The symptoms of this problem may include:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange clients in Site A are slow when attempting to open a
   read receipt, delivery receipt, or non-delivery report but Microsoft
   Exchange clients in Site B open them at normal speed.

<LI>When affinity is set to Site B, but the Microsoft Exchange client in
   Site A  has no physical LAN connection to servers in Site B,
   Microsoft Exchange clients in Site A and Site B are slow when
   attempting to open a read receipt, delivery receipt, or non-delivery
   report.

<LI>When the server containing the only instance of the Organization Forms
   folder is not available. Microsoft Exchange clients in Site A are
   prompted for Domain credentials but Microsoft Exchange clients in Site
   B are not prompted.

<LI>When a trust does not exist between Site A Windows NT Domain and Site
   B Windows NT Domain, the following symptom occurs. When a Site A client
   attempts to access the Organization Forms folder on a server in Site B,
   it is prompted for domain credentials for a valid Windows NT account in
   Site B.
