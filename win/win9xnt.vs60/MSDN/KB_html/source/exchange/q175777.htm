<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Multiple attachments in Outlook Web Access are received as a single blank
or empty attachment or not received at all.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The sender is attempting to send multiple attachments and delimiting the
attachments with a semi-colon. For example, after clicking the Attachment
tab to choose the attachments to send, the user types in multiple filenames
such as "file1;file2". This causes the OWA client to search for a file
named "file1;file2" for the attachment. Because OWA cannot find that
filename, it sends a single blank or empty attachment.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Use the browse feature to select multiple attachments. These items must be
selected individually and added as attachments.
<P>
Note: Netscape Navigator 4.02 and previous versions only support single
attachments. If multiple attachments are selected and sent, the attachments
are received as an icon, but with nothing in them.
