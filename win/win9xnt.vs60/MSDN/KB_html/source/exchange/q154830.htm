The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Windows 95 client, versions 4.0 and 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0 and 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0 and 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The global Send options for the client are set under Options on the Tools
menu, in the main window. The Send options for an individual message are
set in the compose window, under Properties on the File menu.
<P>
Clicking Options on the Tools menu of the compose window does not affect
the message you are composing, although you might expect it to. It is
simply another access point to the global settings. Changes made to the
global settings of the Send options from within the compose window do not
take effect for the message currently being composed, only for subsequent
messages.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you click Properties on the File menu of the compose window, you can
set several Send options for that specific message. The rest of this
article describes these options.

<UL><LI>Importance: Select the priority that you want to assign to the message.
   Marking an item with high or low importance affects the appearance of
   the Importance column in the folder contents list. Importance can be
   assigned as follows:
<P>
<P><PRE>      High: Displays an exclamation point (!). Depending upon how your mail
      server is configured, messages marked with High importance may be
      delivered faster than those marked with Normal or Low importance.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      Normal: Displays no symbol.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      Low: Displays a down arrow.
</PRE><P>
   Of all the options set by the sender, the recipient can only change the
   importance that was assigned to the item.

<LI>Sensitivity: Select the sensitivity that you want to assign to this
   message. The sensitivity level that you assign appears in the
   Sensitivity column, if that column is displayed. You cannot modify the
   sensitivity setting for private, personal, or confidential items once
   they are sent. Private sensitivity also protects the contents of your
   item from being changed when it is replied to or forwarded. Sensitivity
   can be assigned as follows:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Normal: No sensitivity. The Sensitivity column of the item header is
      blank.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      Personal: Displays the word "Personal" in the Sensitivity column.
      Typically, a personal item contains non-business related information.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      Private: Displays the word "Private" in the Sensitivity column and
      prohibits any recipient from modifying your original item when it is
      replied to or forwarded.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      Confidential: Displays the word "Confidential" in the Sensitivity
      column. A confidential item should be treated according to the
      policies on confidentiality of your organization.
</PRE>
<LI>Read Receipt: Sends a receipt to the sender after the recipient opens
   the message. If you are posting an item in a public folder, this option
   is unavailable.

<LI>Delivery Receipt: Sends a receipt to the sender after the message is
   delivered to the recipient. If you are posting an item in a public
   folder, this option is unavailable.

<LI>Save Copy In "Sent Items" Folder: Saves a copy of the active message in
   your Sent Items folder. If you are posting an item in a public folder,
   this option is unavailable.

<LI>Send Options: Specifies advanced options for sending the active
   message. The Internet tab is used to specify the format for attachments.
   The format options are: Don't know, MIME, UUEncode, and BINHEX. The
   Microsoft Exchange Server tab is used to specify when to send messages
   and when to expire messages. Delayed messages are sent to the Outbox
   folder, which holds them for the specified time. After the specified
   time, the message will be immediately sent to the server as long as the
   client is still logged into Exchange. Only unread items are affected by
   the expiration time you specify.
