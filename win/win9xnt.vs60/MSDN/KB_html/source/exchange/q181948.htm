The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Japanese Server, versions 4.0, 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If there exist two or more possible routes between two Microsoft Exchange
Server computers, and one of those servers goes down, messages will attempt
to reroute between all the possible connections until their hop count is
exceeded.
<P>
It is possible that before the hop count is exceeded, the server with the
rerouting message may run out of disk space. This is caused by the
successive rerouting process, which causes the header of the routed
messages to grow in size.
<P>
When the disk space becomes low, the Exchange Administrator may see the
following errors generated in the Windows NT Application log:
<P>
<PRE>   Event ID: 9411
   Source:   MSExchangeMTA
   Type:     Error
   Category: Field Engineering
   Description:
   The MTA is terminating because the disk where MTADATA is located has
   less than 10 MB of space, or an error occurred while trying to check for
   free space on the disk. If disk space is low, free up some disk space
   and restart the MTA. NT Error code returned: 0(non-zero indicates an
   error while checking for free space)[BASE IL TIMER 3](16)

   Event ID: 9406
   Source: MSExchangeMTA
   Category: Resource
   There is not enough Performance Monitor memory to display the MTA
   Connections information. Stop attached Performance Monitors and
   re-start the MTA. [BASE TIMER 3] (14)

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
versions 4.0 and 5.0. This problem has been corrected in Microsoft Exchange
Server version 5.5.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If two Exchange Server computers are connected with two or more connections
and one of those servers goes down, messages (addressed to the server that
is down) on the server that is up will cycle through all possible routes
between them.
<P>
A problem exists in Exchange versions 4.0 and 5.0 when, as the message
passes through each turn at a connector, the P1 header grows in size to
reflect the turn. This header, over time, can become quite large at the hop
count for each connector is 512. So if there are two connectors between the
two servers, the P1 header information will grow in size about 1,024 times.
<P>
This additional information is not needed for reroutes on a single server,
So, in Exchange Server version 5.5, the additional header information is
not added, and the message size remains the same.
<P>
Note that reroutes that span separate Exchange Server computers cause the
P1 header to grow, because this is required when hopping between separate
message transfer agents (MTAs).
