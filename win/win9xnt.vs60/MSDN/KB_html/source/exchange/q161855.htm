The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article discusses a way to restore a backup of the public information
store (Pub.edb) from an earlier Exchange service pack than the one that is
currently running on the Exchange Server computer.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When an Exchange service pack is installed, the private and public
information stores are updated to the current service pack. If you attempt
to use a public or private store from an earlier service pack, the
information store service will fail to start, and the error received will
reflect that the store is the wrong version.
<P>
In case the only good backup is one from an earlier service pack,
you can take steps to get the older information back without having to
reinstall all of Exchange and each of the service packs. If only the public
information store needs to be restored, perform the following procedure:

<OL><P><LI>Determine which version of Exchange was running when the backup of the
   public information store was done.

<P><LI>In Control Panel, open Services, and stop the information store service.

<P><LI>Rename Mdbrest.dll to Mdbrest.xxx. It is located in the EXCHSRVR\BIN
   directory.

<P><LI>Copy the Mdbrest.dll from the SETUP\&lt;platform&gt;\BIN directory of the
   service pack that is the same as the version as the backed-up public
   information store.

<P><LI>Restore the public information store.

<P><LI>Rename Priv.edb to Priv.xxx in the EXCHSRVR\MDBDATA directory.

<P><LI>Run ISINTEG -PATCH. You will get a warning stating that the private
   information store was not found. That is expected because it was just
   renamed.

<P><LI>Start the information store service again.

<P><LI>Log on to the Exchange client as a mailbox that has rights to all the
   public folders. There will be no messages available from the private
   information store at this time, but all the messages and folders in the
   public information store will be available.

<P><LI>Move all the public folders into a personal folder file (*.pst file)
   from the client.

<P><LI>Shut down the client software, and then stop the information store
   service again.

<P><LI>Rename Pub.edb to Pub.xxx, and rename Priv.xxx back to Priv.edb (from
   step 6). These files are in the EXCHSRVR\MDBDATA directory.

<P><LI>Rename or delete Mdbrest.dll in the EXCHSRVR\BIN directory, and then
   rename Mdbrest.xxx to Mdbrest.dll (from step 3).

<P><LI>Run ISINTEG -PATCH. You will get a warning stating that the public
   information store was not found. That is expected because it was just
   renamed.

<P><LI>Start the information store service again.

<P><LI>Log on to the same Exchange client as in step 9, and move all the
   public folders from the personal folder file up to All Public Folders.
<P>
</OL>This procedure brings public folders from an earlier service pack and
updates them to the latest service pack without your having to reinstall
Exchange and all the service packs.
