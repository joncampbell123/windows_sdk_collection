The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When using the Microsoft Exchange Administrator's program to view the
properties of the Microsoft Mail Connector object in the Connections
container, the following error is displayed:
<P>
<PRE>   Extension 'MS' could not be loaded. An error occurred during file
   replication. Unable to find the extension .dll file with the correct
   version number. To view details of the error, see the application event
   log in the Windows NT event viewer on the Microsoft Exchange server
   computer.
   Microsoft Exchange Administrator
   ID No: c1030ad1

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The dialog presents three command buttons; Abort, Retry, and Ignore. If you
choose Ignore, the Microsoft Mail Connector dialog is displayed with non-
standard types of dialog tabs. In other words, there may be a Queues tab,
an Export Container tab, an Import Container tab, and so forth.
<P>
If you click Queues tab, an EDK gateway mailbox is created in the
Information Store for the Microsoft Mail Connector. This mailbox causes
mail to and from Microsoft Mail recipients to be placed in this mailbox
rather than in the MTA queue. The mail trapped in this mailbox is
unrecoverable.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may occur for either of the following reasons:
<P>
<P><h3>Case 1</h3>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Exchange Administrator program cannot load an Admin extension
required when displaying the Microsoft Mail Connector dialog box. This
problem causes the dialog box to be displayed.
<P>
<P><h3>Case 2</h3>
 
<P>
When you click the Ignore button on the dialog box mentioned above, it
displays an incorrect default property page. This default property page
includes the Queues tab and clicking it causes the creation of the mailbox.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
The two resolutions match the two listed in the previous section.
<P>
<P><h3>Case 1</h3>
 
<P>
Fix the cause of the extension dll not being loaded properly. This will
prevent the error dialog from being displayed and in turn will not lead to
the creation of the Microsoft Mail Connector mailbox in the store. Some
common reasons for the extension not being loaded properly include:

<UL><LI>The Add-ins directory on the Microsoft Exchange Server is not shared.

<LI>The Add-ins share does not grant the appropriate rights.

<LI>The dll for the extension trying to be loaded is the incorrect version.

<LI>The Microsoft Exchange Server platform differs from the platform where
   the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program is being run from and the
   appropriate platform's dll is not available in the Directory service.
<P>
   NOTE: If none of the above reasons apply, a network trace from the
   computer running the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program to the
   Microsoft Exchange Server may be needed in order to obtain enough
   information to resolve the problem.
<P>
</UL><h3>Case 2</h3>
 
<P>
Apply the "Case 2" fix described in the "Status" section of this article.
The Admin.exe program was corrected to display only two command buttons,
Retry and Cancel. Retry will attempt to reload the files with .dll
extension. Cancel will quit the process and return to the Microsoft
Exchange Administrator program.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
versions 5.0 and 5.5. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. 
Service Pack for Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0. For information 
on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word in the 
Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

</PRE>We are currently researching this problem in Microsoft Exchange Server,
version 5.5 and will post more information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
