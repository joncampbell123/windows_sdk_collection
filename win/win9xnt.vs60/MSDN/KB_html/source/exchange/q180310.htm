The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Outlook for Windows 3.1x, Exchange Server Edition, version 8.0
<LI>Microsoft Outlook Windows 95 client, versions 8.00, 8.01, 8.02, 8.03
<LI>Microsoft Outlook Windows NT client, versions 8.00, 8.01, 8.02, 8.03
</UL>

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the Outlook client to view a nested replica of a public
folder, you may not be able to view the information even though you have
proper permissions to the folder. The following error may occur:
<P>
<PRE>  Unable to expand the folder. The Set of folders could not be opened.
  The contents of this public folder are currently unavailable. Either
  the Microsoft Exchange Server computer servicing this public folder
  is down or the public folder has not been replicated to this site.
  See your Administrator.

</PRE><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To be able to view and use the public folders properly, you may use either
of the following methods:
<P>
<PRE>   Install and use the Exchange client to view and post messages to the
   nested public folder(s). The Exchange Server client allows access to the
   nested replica of the public folder(s), assuming permissions are
   correct.

   -or-

   From the Exchange Administrator program, replicate the entire public
   folder hierarchy that contains the nested public folder(s) from the
   original Exchange site to your other Exchange site(s). This will allow
   Outlook clients in this Exchange site to access the nested public
   folder(s) replicas.

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
