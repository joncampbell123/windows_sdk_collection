<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Granting Author rights to a folder within a Mailbox requires that the
Mailbox have at least Reviewer rights. Without Reviewer rights, the user
will receive one of the following messages when attempting to view the
folder:
<P>
<PRE>   The set of folders could not be opened. You do not have sufficient
   permission to perform this operation on this object. See the folder
   contact or the system Administrator.

</PRE>-or-
<P>
<PRE>   The set of folders could not be opened. The client operation failed.

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
For example, if User1 wants to grant User2 rights to a folder named
Projects, User1 must grant User2 at least Reviewer privilege to his
Mailbox. By granting User2 Reviewer privilege to the Mailbox, User2 will be
able to see all Top-Level folders. Also by granting Reviewer privilege to
User2 on the Mailbox, User2 will be able to see any Sub-Folders contained
in Projects.
<P>
This behavior is by design. Microsoft Exchange clients may consider it a
security risk if the Microsoft Exchange user is only wanting to provide
access to a particular folder and not to their Mailbox. If this is the
case, Microsoft Exchange users should consider using public folders as a
workaround for providing access to specific folders.
