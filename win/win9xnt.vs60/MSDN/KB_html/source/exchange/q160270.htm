<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The BackOffice Resource Kit Part One (BORK 1), which includes the Microsoft
Exchange Server 4.0 Resource Kit and the Systems Management Server Resource
Kit, is now available. This article describes the new Microsoft Exchange
tools available in BORK 1 and the bug fixes made to the tools previously
released on the Microsoft Exchange Server Resource Kit compact
disc.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
BORK 1 supersedes the Microsoft Exchange Server Resource Kit compact disc.
BORK 1 contains all the original tools released on the Resource Kit compact
disc as well as the following six new Microsoft Exchange tools.

<UL><LI>AT&amp;T Mail Migration Wizard
   Migrates AT&amp;T Mail Access PLUS and AT&amp;T PMX mail messages into personal
   folders or a mailbox.

<LI>AutoFill
   Assists in resolving display names as you type in the Microsoft Exchange
   client.

<LI>Profile Generator
   Simplifies the process of creating Microsoft Exchange client profiles
   for roving users. When you create profiles for each type of operating
   system, users can use any computer with any operating system and still
   have access to their mailbox.

<LI>Schedule+ Address Book Assistant
   Copies address book entries and enters them into a Microsoft Schedule+
   contact list.

<LI>Self-Certification Form
   For Temporary Export of encryption software; this tool is to be used
   when taking products that contain encryption, such as Microsoft Exchange
   Server, out of the country.

<LI>Simple Mail Handler
   Archives and filters incoming messages in the Microsoft Exchange client.
   This tool is client-based, so connection to a Microsoft Exchange Server
   is not necessary.
<P>
