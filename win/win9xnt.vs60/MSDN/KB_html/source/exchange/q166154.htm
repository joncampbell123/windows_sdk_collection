The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0 and 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After you add a new recipients container to the list of Exported Containers
for either a Dirsync Requester object or Remote Dirsync Requester object,
some names in the new recipients container may not be sent in the next
directory synchronization (dirsync) cycle as expected.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Exchange Directory Synchronization service (DXA) did not
always handle this properly.
<P>
Every object within a Microsoft Exchange Directory has a USN-Changed value.
This value is updated every time that the object is modified. The USN-
Changed value is what the DXA uses to determine if an object that it is
synchronizing with Microsoft Mail for PC Networks has changed since the
last dirsync cycle.
<P>
When a new recipients container is added to the list of Exported
Containers, the DXA should look for all objects with a USN-Changed value
greater than zero within that new recipients container and send those
objects out as dirsync transactions. Due to a logic error in the DXA, the
DXA was treating the new recipients container as if it had always been in
the list of export containers.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>DXA Is Acting as Dirsync Server</h3>
 
<P>
If the DXA is acting as the dirsync server, each remote dirsync requester
must request a full import from the DXA. This can be accomplished by
performing either of the following two procedures.
<P>
Procedure 1 - Use the Admin.exe Utility:

<OL><P><LI>Start the Microsoft Mail for PC Networks Admin.exe utility
   against the Requester postoffice that is now expecting the new
   recipients container.

<P><LI>Select Config, Dirsync, Requester, Import, and YES.
<P>
</OL>Repeat these two steps for each requester postoffice expecting the new
containers Recipients to be sent.
<P>
<P>
Procedure 2 - Use the Exchange Administrator Program:

<OL><P><LI>Start the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program.

<P><LI>Highlight the Remote Requester object, open the File menu, and click
   Properties.

<P><LI>On the General tab, select the Export on Next Cycle checkbox.
<P>
</OL>Repeat these three steps for each Remote Requester object expecting the new
containers recipients to be sent.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>DXA Is Acting as a Dirsync Requester</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program.

<P><LI>Highlight the Remote Requester object, open the File menu, and click
   Properties.

<P><LI>On the General tab, select the Export on Next Cycle checkbox.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server,
version 4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service
Pack for Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on
obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft
