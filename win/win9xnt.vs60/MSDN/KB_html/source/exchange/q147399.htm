The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0
 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Encryption is a feature of advanced security which provides confidentiality
by allowing users to conceal data. The data is encrypted when it is written
to disk and when it is sent over a network connection.
<P>
Microsoft Exchange Server can use one of three encryption algorithms to
encrypt the contents of a message: CAST-64, DES, and CAST-40. The US/Canada
version of the Microsoft Exchange Client supports all three algorithms. All
other international (localized) versions of the Microsoft Exchange Client
support only the CAST-40 algorithm.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
All clients with the exception of those distributed in U.S. and Canada
support 40-bit encryption only. Below are examples of how the encryption
scheme is determined.
<P>
US/Canada client sends encrypted mail to international client:
<P>
<PRE>   The encryption is downgraded to 40bit for the entire message. Even if
   there are US/Canada recipients, they will get 40-bit also.

</PRE>International client sends encrypted mail to US/Canada client:
<P>
<PRE>   The encryption used will be 40-bit since the international client is not
   capable of higher key length.

</PRE>US/Canada client sends encrypted mail to US/Canada client only:
<P>
<PRE>   The message is sent with the preferred encryption algorithm which is
   either CAST64 (default) or DES depending on the setting of the algorithm
   in the site when the user was security enabled. If there are
   a mixture of CAST64 &amp; DES users then we encrypt with CAST64.
