<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Exchange clients allow you to enter an alias on the To: line
instead of the complete address of a user. The Microsoft Exchange client
will attempt to resolve the alias to the full address. If there are
multiple matching entries, it will display them and allow you to select the
correct address. This feature is call Ambiguous Name Resolution (ANR).
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
There are two ways to enter alias names on the To: line. The correct one to
choose depends on how broadly you want the Microsoft Exchange client to
search the address book.

<OL><P><LI>With just the ALIAS (TO: ALIAS) - If you choose this option, the client
   will search the entire selected address book for any Surnames,
   DisplayNames, Aliases, Offices, or EmailAddresses that match the alias
   entered. This will include partial matches. If multiple addresses are
   located, the Microsoft Exchange client will display the CHECK NAMES
   window and allow the user to select the correct address.
<P>
   Example: If 'ADAMS' is entered on the To: line, the Microsoft Exchange
   client will search the locations listed above and list all items that
   match ADAMS along with partial matches like ADAMSON.

<P><LI>With an equal sign (=) preceding the ALIAS (TO: =ALIAS) - If you choose
   this option, the Microsoft Exchange client will search the entire
   selected address book for any Surnames, DisplayNames, Aliases, Offices,
   or EmailAddresses that match the alias entered. This will not include
   partial matches. If multiple addresses are located, the Microsoft
   Exchange client will display the CHECK NAMES window and allow the user
   to select the correct address.
<P>
   Example: If '=ADAMS' is entered on the To: line, the Microsoft Exchange
   client will search the locations listed above and list all items that
   match ADAMS but NOT partial names like ADAMSON.
