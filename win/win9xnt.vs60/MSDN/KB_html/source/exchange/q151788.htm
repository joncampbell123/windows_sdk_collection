<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0 and 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Exchange Server administrators may find that newly created
objects (for example, recipients) on one server have not replicated to
other servers (within a site or between sites), even though a reasonable
period of time has passed for replication to have occurred.
<P>
The total recipients count (in the lower left corner of the Microsoft
Exchange Server Administrator program window) may remain consistently less
than that of other servers in the site. Also, users may find that an
address is not available in the Global Address List.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The "Reps-From" update sequence number (USN) count on the server not taking
replicas from the replicating server has been incorrectly advanced to a
value higher than the current USN issued by the target server's directory
service.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 

<OL><P><LI>The first step in troubleshooting these symptoms is to positively
   diagnose whether the server's tardy replication is caused by either the
   problem described in this article or the one in the article <B><A href="../exchange/q152942.htm">Q152942</A></B>,
   "XADM: Slow Intra-site Directory Replication Between Servers." These
   conditions are rare.

<P><LI>If you are sure that a server maintains a higher "Reps-
   From" USN than the highest USN assigned by the that server, do one of
   the following:
<P>
   a. If the high "Reps-From" count is between two replication bridgehead
<P><PRE>      servers in a multi-site Microsoft Exchange Server organization:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>         Redefine one of the other servers in the site lacking replicas as
         the replication bridgehead for the site.

       If the server is a single-server site:

         Delete the replication connector and the other site object(s)
         associated with this replication connector (in both sites). Allow
         the delete to complete, and then reconfigure the directory
         replication connector.

   b. If the high "Reps-From" count is between two servers within a site,
      Re-install the server harboring the high "Reps-From" count into the
      site, following the steps documented in Microsoft Knowledge Base
      article <B><A href="../exchange/q162353.htm">Q162353</A></B>, "XADM: Restoring an Exchange Directory."

</PRE></OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
versions 4.0 and 5.0.
A supported fix to this problem in Microsoft Exchange version 4.0 is in
development, but has not been fully regression-tested and should be applied
only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you are severely
impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait for
the next Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft Technical
Support for more information on the availability of this fix.
<P>
This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange 5.0 Server U.S.
Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):
