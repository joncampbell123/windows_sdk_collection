<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0 and 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you try to change the password on a Microsoft Exchange client that is
running in Microsoft Windows 3.x or Microsoft Windows for Workgroups
version 3.11 and you are using Novell VLM client software, the following
error message may appear:
<P>
<PRE>   The NT Domain password could not be changed. A required action was not
   successful due to an unspecified error.

</PRE>This may also occur with other clients running on other operation systems
and networking software using TCP/IP or IPX as their protocol.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this problem, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>For NetWare clients, install the Gateway Services for NetWare on the
   primary domain controller (PDC), which has the Microsoft Exchange user
   accounts.

<P><LI>Ensure that the client is running the latest version of the networking
   files from the software provider.

<P><LI>Ensure that the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) service is configured to
   start automatically. This can be changed in Control Panel Services.
<P>
</OL>WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall Windows NT. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved.
Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
NOTE: Normally, registry entries are not case sensitive. However, in the 
case of both of these entries, they are case sensitive. When adding these 
new keys, be sure to match the case exactly as it is shown in Step 5.

<OL><P><LI>Ensure that the registry on the PDC has the following entries. If these
   entries are missing, add them according to the instructions in Step 5.
   Look for the entries at the following registry key:
<P>
<P><PRE>      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\LSA
</PRE><P>
   If the PDC has NWLink installed, the entry should be:
<P>
<P><PRE>      NetWareClientSupport:REG_DWORD:0x1
</PRE><P>
   If the PDC has TCP/IP installed, the entry should be:
<P>
<P><PRE>      TcpipClientSupport:REG_DWORD:0x1
</PRE><P>
</OL>WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall Windows NT. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved.
Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

<OL><P><LI>Add the registry values to the PDC because it is here that the Windows
   NT password is changed. To add the values:
<P>
   a. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).
<P>
   b. Under the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following subkey:
<P>
<P><PRE>      SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\LSA
</PRE><P>
   c. On the Edit menu, click Add Value.
<P>
   d. If NWLink is installed on the PDC, type "NetWareClientSupport"
<P><PRE>     (without the quotation marks) under Field Type.
</PRE><P>
   e. In the Data Type field, choose REG_DWORD, and click OK.
<P>
   f. In the DWORD editor, in the Data field, type "1".
<P>
   g. Click OK. The new value should appear as an entry.
<P>
   h. Repeat steps a through f for TcpipClientSupport if TCPIP is installed
<P><PRE>      on the PDC.
</PRE><P>
   i. Restart the PDC for the changes to take effect.
