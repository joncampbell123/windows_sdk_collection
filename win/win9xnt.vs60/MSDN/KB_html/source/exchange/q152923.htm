The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Macintosh client, versions 4.0 and 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The following error messages appear when the Windows NT domain password for
a Microsoft Exchange Macintosh client expires:
<P>
<PRE>   Your Microsoft Exchange Server is unavailable.

   You can retry connecting to the server using the network, or work
   offline and connect using dial-up networking.

   You must change your password before logging on for the first time.

</PRE>You can then log on to Microsoft Exchange in the offline mode. Errors may
occur, stating that the folders stored on the server cannot be opened. Once
logged on offline, the user attempts to change the password from within
Microsoft Exchange by selecting the Password Change option on the Tools
menu (to do this, click Options, click Exchange Server, and then click
Password Change). The correct information is given and the AppleTalk zone
window is displayed. The final error message states:
<P>
<PRE>   The NT domain password could not be changed. A required action was not
   successful due to an unspecified error.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Changing an expired domain password from within Exchange is not supported
in the Microsoft Exchange Macintosh client. Windows NT Server does
not support interactive domain logons for Macintosh clients. Interactive
logons are required for the Macintosh client to get information such as how
many days are left until the password's expiration.
<P>
Changing the Windows NT domain password before it expires is supported from
within Exchange.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
There are four possible workarounds:

<UL><LI>Set the Maximum Password Age under Account Policies in User Manager to
   "Password Never Expires." This affects all security accounts manager
   (SAM) accounts.

<LI>Individually set "Password Never Expires" for each Macintosh user
   account under User Properties in User Manager.

<LI>The administrator can manually reset the password each time it expires.

<LI>An expired password can be changed over Appletalk; this  is supported.
   Windows NT 3.51 with Service Pack 5, or a later version of Windows NT,
   is required on the primary domain controller (PDC).
<P>
</UL>WARNING: Using Registry Editor can cause serious, system-wide errors that
may require you to reinstall Windows NT. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved.
Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
<PRE>   Also, a second requirement for this workaround is that the
   AppletalkClientSupport registry setting under
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\system\currentcontrolset\control\lsa needs to be
   set on the PDC as follows:

      AppletalkClientSupport REG_DWORD 1

</PRE>The steps for changing an expired password over Appletalk are as follows:

<OL><P><LI>Install Windows NT Services for Macintosh on a computer running Windows
   NT (see Windows NT version requirements above).

<P><LI>The Macintosh user connects to the Windows NT server using the
   AppleShare option from the Chooser.

<P><LI>The Macintosh user selects the "Microsoft Authentication" logon method.

<P><LI>The Macintosh user selects Microsoft UAM Volume.

<P><LI>The Macintosh user drags the AppleShare Folder from within the UAM
   Volume to his or her system folder. (See Readme.uam in this folder for
   important installation information--especially localization
   requirements.)

<P><LI>The Macintosh user drags Microsoft UAM Volume to the Trash to log off
   the Windows NT server.

<P><LI>The Macintosh user reconnects to the Windows NT Server from the
   Macintosh client and specifies the Microsoft Authentication logon
   method.

<P><LI>The UAM will handle the appropriate password expiration scenarios and
   allow the user to change his or her password at logon.

<P><LI>Once the password has been changed, the user can just click Cancel
   rather than mounting a volume and dragging it to the Trash.
<P>
</OL>Additionally, note that the default behavior when an account is created is
to require the user to change the password at next logon. This works the
same way as an expired password. In this case the administrator must clear
the "User Must Change Password at Next Logon" option under User Properties
in User Manager for Domains.
