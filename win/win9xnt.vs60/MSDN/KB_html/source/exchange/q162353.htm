The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If you need to restore an Exchange Server computer and you are unable to
recover the Directory, you can still recover the information in the Private
and Public Stores. Typical methods to recover the Directory include running
EDBUTIL /D /R or first recovering the Windows NT security accounts manager
(SAM) database.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To recover the information in the Private and Public Stores:

<OL><P><LI>If possible, from the Exchange Administrator Program, on the Tools menu,
   click Directory Export and export all Recipient containers on this
   server. If this server cannot be brought up long enough to get to this
   point, you can perform the Directory Export from another server, in the
   same or other site, that contains the Directory information for the
   users from this server.

<P><LI>In Control Panel Services, stop the Microsoft Exchange System Attendant.
   When prompted, click OK to stop all of the other Microsoft Exchange
   Server services.

<P><LI>Copy the Pub.edb, Priv.edb, all Edb*.log files, all Res*.log files and
   the Edb.chk file to another directory or another server as a backup.

<P><LI>Run Setup.exe from the Exchange Server CD, and click Remove All when
   prompted. Verify and remove all Exchange directories (across all drives
   if Optimization was run).

<P><LI>Run Setup.exe again, and reinstall the server with the same Organization
   Name and Site Name as before. Be careful to make sure each name is typed
   exactly as it was before, because both the Organization Name and Site
   Name are case-sensitive.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: Remember to reapply any Service Packs applied in the previous
install.

<OL><P><LI>In Control Panel Services, stop the Microsoft Exchange System Attendant.
   When prompted, click OK to stop all of the other Microsoft Exchange
   Server services.

<P><LI>Move all the files out of the Exchsrvr\Mdbdata directory (across all
   drives if Optimization was run). Copy to this directory the all files
   that were copied to another directory or server in step 1 (Pub.edb,
   Priv.edb, all Edb*.log files, all Res*.log files and  the Edb.chk file).

<P><LI>Start the Microsoft Exchange System Attendant and Microsoft Exchange
   Directory services in Control Panel Services.

<P><LI>From a command prompt, change directories to Exchsrvr\Bin, and carry out
   the following command:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Isinteg -patch
</PRE>
<P><LI>Start the remaining Microsoft Exchange Server services
   in Control Panel Services.

<P><LI>Run the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator Program against the
   server you are recovering.

<P><LI>If there were any other Recipients container aside from the default
   Recipients container, re-create them all. It is important that these
   containers have the same name and are nested (Recipient containers
   within Recipient containers) under the same containers as they were
   before the restore.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: The users in nested containers will not be recovered if step 1 was
not performed. For additional information, please see the following article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : XADM: DS/IS Fails to Re-create Mailboxes in Subcontainers

</PRE></OL>If step 1 was successful, perform only step 13 below. If step 1 was not
successful, (no CSV file could be created), skip step 13 below and perform
steps 14 through 16 below.

<OL><P><LI>Using the CSV file created in Step 1, on the Tools menu, click
   Directory Import and import the Directory entries into the Directory.

<P><LI>Highlight the Server Object (Organization, Site, Configuration,
   Servers, &lt;servername&gt;), choose File Properties (Alt+Enter), and click
   the Advanced tab.

<P><LI>Under DS/IS Consistency adjustment, click All Inconsistencies and click
   Adjust.
<P>
</OL>At this point, all Users should show up in their respective containers
except those users who are in nested containers.

<OL><P><LI>Go to the properties of each individual mailbox on the server. At the
   bottom of the property sheet, click Primary Windows NT Account, and then
   click Select an existing Windows NT account, and then select the
   corresponding Windows NT account from the Add User or Group list.
<P>
</OL>After these procedures are done, the users should be able to log into
the server without having lost their mail messages and the public
folders should have been restored as well.
