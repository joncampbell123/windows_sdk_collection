The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you compose a message, enable a delivery receipt (DR), and send it to
another Exchange user through an X.400 Connector, the received DR does not
show the correct information. Instead of the DR showing the original
message's Subject, Delivery Time, and Recipient, every field becomes
"UNKNOWN".
<P>
This problem is mailbox dependent. It cannot be reproduced for every
mailbox. Results differ even on the same Exchange Server computer.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When the original message is not part of a report, the information store
searches the original sender's "sent items" folder using the MTS-ID for the
message. The search will terminate if no value is found for the MTS-ID, and
the pr_original_* properties will not be set.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>

version 4.0.
