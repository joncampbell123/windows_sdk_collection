<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If you have a lot of forms installed to your forms cache (they don't need to
be running, just installed) and you try to delete a form that you do not
have permissions to, you may receive the following error:
<P>
<PRE>   There was a problem deleting the form. You need more memory or system
   resources. Close some windows and try again.

</PRE>instead of an error stating that you do not have privileges to perform the
operation.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 4.0 of Microsoft
Exchange. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
