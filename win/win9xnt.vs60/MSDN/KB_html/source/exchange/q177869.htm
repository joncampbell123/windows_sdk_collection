The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server versions 5.0 and 5.5
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Messages that are received into Microsoft Exchange via the Microsoft Mail
Connector and have X.400 addresses in the From field may contain non-
printable characters and may not be deliverable by other mail systems.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Mail Connector converts incoming messages that contain Escape
Sequences ('//', '$/', and so on) in the DDA.VALUE to non-printable
characters and does not convert them to the proper characters ('/') before
passing the messages into Microsoft Exchange.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0.
<P>
This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on obtaining the
Service Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge 
Base (without the spaces):
<P>
<PRE>   S E R V P A C K

</PRE>Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5.
<P>
A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested
and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem.
Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix.
Contact Microsoft Product Support Services for more information.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
X.400 addresses that have a DDA.VALUE of a Microsoft Mail address
(net/po/alias) (or any other field that contains a '/' character) will need
to Escape the '/' character with either '$' or '/' if the delimiter between
fields is a '/' character.
<P>
These Escaped characters (and the following '/') are converted to a non-
printable character so that they are not mistaken for a delimiter during
the separation process of the address. After this is done, the non-
printable character is replaced with a single '/' because the delimiter has
been changed to a ';'.
<P>
An example of this is:
<PRE>   /c=us/a=mci/p=microsoft/o=pss/dda.type=ms/dda.value=microsoft$/pss$/mail
   box

</PRE>to
<P>
<PRE>   /c=us/a=mci/p=microsoft/o=pss/dda.type=ms/dda.value=microsoft[171]pss[17
   1]mailbox

</PRE>to
<P>
<PRE>   c=us;a=mci;p=microsoft;o=pss;dda:ms=microsoft/pss/mailbox
