<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0 and 5.5

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Attachments received via an X.400 connector that originate from an Isocor
MTA arrive without any indication of the original attachment name.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Isocor X.400 systems attach additional information when transferring
attachments to track attachment names (attachment manifests). Prior to
Exchange Server 5.0, this additional information arrived as a text
attachment detailing attachment names. However, Exchange Server 5.0 and 5.5
incorrectly interprets this information to try to re-build the attachment
with a name. As a result, the attachment name is no longer available.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Exchange Server versions
5.0 and 5.5.
A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested
and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem.
Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix.
Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
