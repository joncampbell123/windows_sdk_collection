The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, and 5.5
</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Exchange, a password-protected PST cannot be recovered if the 
password for that PST is lost or forgotten. Nor does Microsoft offer any 
information regarding services or processes that provide breaking or 
bypassing password protected PST's. 
<P>
Additionally, Microsoft cannot recover the contents of an OST.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Support for security and password protection is limited to answering user
questions about security features. Microsoft's support service operations
cannot assist users in opening password-protected files. There are inherent
legal risks associated with doing this, and we do not have the resources
available to thoroughly investigate such requests to ensure that there are
no misrepresentations or disputes concerning the ownership of files and
authorization to break into them. Microsoft will, however, cooperate with
law enforcement representatives as required by law, meaning pursuant to a
court order, subpoena, search warrant or other form of legal compulsion, to
the extent we are able to do so. We will also not provide users with
information about third-party companies that may provide password-breaking
services, nor refer them to any such company.
