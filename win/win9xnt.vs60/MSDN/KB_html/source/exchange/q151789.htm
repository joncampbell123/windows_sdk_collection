<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you perform an online backup of either the information or directory
store, you may see the following entry recorded in the application log:
<P>
<PRE>   Event ID: 23
   Source: EDB
   Type: Error
   Category: Database Page Cache
   Description:  MSExchangeIS ((455)) Direct read found corrupted page
   error -1018 ((1:251563) (0-2295758), 251563 379225672 381322824),
   Please restore the database from a previous backup.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When you perform a transaction with the Jet database, the information store
or the directory store writes the transaction to a transaction log file
(Edb*.log in Mdbdata or Dsadata). The transaction is then committed to the
Jet database from this transaction log. During this process, the Jet engine
calculates the page's checksum value to be written, records it in the page
header, and then requests that the file system writes the 4-KB page of data
to the database on disk. In brief, the file system will take this call and
use Windows NT system services to forward this request to the corresponding
hardware device driver to actually perform the write. The hardware device
driver returns this information to the file system, which then returns it
to the Jet engine. If the call is successful, Jet continues.
<P>
If you have faulty hardware or hardware that caches requests before it
performs the operation, the hardware may return success to calls made to it
before it actually performs the physical operation. This is done to improve
performance (especially in SCSI controllers and hard drives). When the
actual physical operation takes place, however, an error occurs and the
data is not written successfully as expected.
<P>
When the Microsoft Exchange Server information store or directory store is
backed up online, before the 4-KB page is written to tape, a checksum
comparison is done. The backup routine makes a request to read a 4-KB page
of data from disk. When the request is received, Jet again calculates the
checksum value. This checksum from the read operation is then compared with
the checksum recorded during the write operation. If there is a mismatch,
Jet interprets it as a corrupted page.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve the problem, use one of the following methods.
<P>
<P><h3>Restore from a Backup</h3>
 
<P>
When you encounter the error, the recommended and most reliable way to
recover the database is to restore from the last known good backup.
However, if the hardware problem still exists, you will continue to have
corruption. The Windows NT system log should be reviewed for errors
reported by the storage device drivers. These errors should be dealt with
and resolved before the database is restored to this server. Another
common cause is the use of write-back caching on hard drives. Write-back
caching should be turned off on hard disk drives when used with Microsoft
Exchange Server (or any transaction log-based relational database system).
<P>
IMPORTANT: Only restore the database to the same hardware after the
problems have been resolved.
<P>
<P><h3>Use Edbutil.exe</h3>
 
<P>
As an alternate way to repair the bad page of data, use Edbutil.exe.
<P>
IMPORTANT: Make a full offline file backup of the database and log files
before running this process. This includes file-level backups of the
Exchsrvr\Dsadata and Exchsrvr\Mdbdata folders. This will ensure that
there is a way to go back should Edbutil fail.
<P>
Edbutil.exe is a low-level Jet database utility that defragments and checks
the consistency of the database. There is also a repair option (Edbutil /d
/r &lt;dbname&gt;) that attempts to repair bad pages and remove them if the
repair is unsuccessful. If a page is removed using the repair option, data
loss will occur. A page in a database can contain messages, folders,
tables, master indexes, and so forth. There is no way to tell what Edbutil
has removed because Jet sees it as raw data. After repair has finished on
the Jet database, run Isinteg.exe in fix mode on the same database that
Edbutil was run on. Isinteg will clean up any inconsistencies between the
pointers from the information store to the actual data in the Jet database.
If Isinteg is not run immediately following repair (Edbutil /d /r),
corruption may occur in user mailboxes. Users will have messages that
cannot be opened, incorrect read/unread counts, and so forth.
<P>
Refer to the "Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator's Guide" for more
details on the use of Edbutil.exe and Isinteg.exe.
