IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it
if a problem occurs. For information on how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" online Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry
Key" online Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Exchange Server download logging feature writes events to the
Windows NT Event Log when users download attachments, messages, and folders
from public or private folders. You can use this information for billing or
tracking download costs.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
A download event is logged when the user moves or copies an item from the
private or public information store to a different store, such as a
Personal Folder file. The item can be a message, attachment, or folder,
depending on the configuration selected as described in the following
section.
<P>
For example, if Log Downloads is set to 1 in the ParametersPublic registry
key, every time a user moves or copies a message with an attachment to the
user's Personal Folder file, an event is logged.
<P>
The following information is logged:
<P>
  User name
  Mailbox name
  Size of item downloaded
  Document type
  Document identifier
<P>
The following example is an event generated by the download feature.
<P>
<PRE>   Shannon Boyd (SHABOY) downloaded 1456 bytes from attachment 6A

</PRE>You establish download logging by editing the registry of a Microsoft
Exchange Server with RegEdit, a Windows NT administrative tool. The values
you add apply to all public and private folders on the server.
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall Windows. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be
solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and
Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" online Help
topics in Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before
you edit it.
