The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server versions 4.0, 5.0, and 5.5
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
An object persists in the directory of a remote site even though the
object has been deleted from its original site.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Typically, the site that still contains the object failed to receive a
replica of that object prior to the object's tombstone expiring. Once an
object's tombstone expires, it is no longer considered an "object", and is
not replicated. See MORE INFORMATION, below.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
There are two approaches to resolution: re-creating the orphaned object in
its "original context" or re-orienting replication bridgehead servers. Both
should result in the cleanup of the orphaned object. Depending on the
situation, one approach may be less involved or less impacting than the
other.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1. Re-create the Orphaned Object in Its "Original Context"</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create the object so that it has its original distinguished name (DN);
   for instance, an orphaned mailbox should be re-created in the original
   site and so on, such that its "Obj-Dist-Name" attribute matches that of
   the orphaned object as viewed in Raw Properties in the Administrator
   program.

<P><LI>Modify some attribute of this re-created object until the "Object
   Version" attribute value exceeds the "Object Version" value on the
   orphaned object as viewed in in Raw Properties in the Administrator
   program.

<P><LI>Allow the re-created object to replicate to the site(s) maintaining an
   orphaned replica.

<P><LI>Verify that the new replica has replicated to the orphan's site by
   viewing the orphan's "Object Version" attribute; it should increase to
   the value incremented in step 2 above.

<P><LI>Delete the re-created object in its origin site. This deletion should
   now replicate to all sites.
<P>
  Or...
<P>
</OL><h3>Method 2. Re-orient Replication Bridgehead Servers</h3>
 
<P>
This method involves re-orienting replication bridgehead servers between
the site maintaining the orphan and the site that "feeds" that context to
the orphan site. This assumes that at least two servers in each site exist,
and that the servers that are not currently replication BHs can assume this
role, at least temporarily. This will likely result in a full refresh of
all objects from all contexts previously provided by the "feeder" site;thus
including the refresh of the orphan object context.
<P>
NOTE: A third option would be to break the replication connector between
the orphan site and its "feeder" site. This should only be a last resort,
because it has a much higher impact on other servers in the site and any
downstream sites, and certainly should avoided in larger organizations when
the orphan site is also a "feeder" site to additional downstream sites.
<P>
MORE INFORMATION
 
<P>
Object Deletion, Tombstone Lifetime, Tombstone Expiry, and Garbage
Collection Interval
<P>
When a directory object (also known as a specific Naming Context or NC) is
deleted (be it a mailbox, Customer Recipient (CR), Distribution List,
Connector, and so on, hidden or not), a tombstone property (date and
timestamp that the delete of the object was performed) is added to the
object’s properties, an "IsDeleted" attribute is added and set to TRUE, and
the object is "hidden" from view.
<P>
These attribute changes should result in the replication of this "new"
version of the object to ALL other directories. Within each directory, a
garbage collection thread routinely executes (based on value specified for
&lt;site&gt;\Configuration\DS Site Configuration\Garbage Collection Interval) and
removes objects whose "IsDeleted" attribute is TRUE, and whose tombstone
property is older than:
<P>
<PRE>   the current date\time minus the value specified for
   &lt;site&gt;\Configuration\DS Site Configuration\Tombstone Lifetime

</PRE></OL>The defaults for Tombstone Lifetime and Garbage Collection Interval are 30
days and 12 hours, respectively. So, by default, any object whose tombstone
(date the object was deleted in the Administrator program) is older than 30
days (from "now") will be garbage collected (which actually means having
most properties stripped off, leaving only a small stub in the directory).
<P>
Orphaned Objects
<P>
If conditions (configuration, hardware or network problems, and so on)
prevent one or more other sites (or local site directories) from receiving
an update of a naming context (NC) during the tombstone period, these other
sites (and servers) never find out that the objects have been flagged for
deletion. Once the tombstone expires in the originating site, the object is
removed from that site's directory, and there is no longer an object to
replicate. Since the tombstone never replicated to some other servers, and
since the only writable copy of the object has now been deleted, these
objects are orphaned in site(s) that never received a replica of the object
with the "IsDeleted" flag and tombstone "timestamp".
<P>
WARNING: Tombstone lifetime and Garbage Collection Interval are site-wide
attributes. Reducing the Tombstone lifetime within a site to a value of
only a few days can increase the possible occurrence of orphaned objects -
particularly in large organizations, where it can be more difficult to
assess the state of replication organization wide. There is little to gain
from reducing this value, and it is not recommended. The minimum value is
two days.
<P>
WARNING: Use of "MTACHECK /RD" to remove directory replication messages
from a backlogged MTA queue may contribute to orphaned objects. This
procedure should NOT be used as a routine method of reducing MTA backlogs.
The real solution is to find the cause of the backlog, and resolve that
problem. If it is determined that directory replication scheduling has been
set to "ALWAYS", and that this has resulted in MTA queue backlogs, then
"MTACHECK /RD" might be appropriate AFTER scheduling has been correctly
set.
<P>
Determining the Original Context of Orphaned Objects
<P>
View the objects raw properties. The following attributes can be revealing:
<P>
<PRE>   Obj-Dist-Name: This is the full DN of the object, and specifies the
   precise location (origin context) of the object in the directory
   information tree (DIT). This should be all that's needed to identify an
   orphaned object's origin.

   DSA-Signature: This corresponds to a particular directory's Invocation-
   ID, and identifies the directory responsible for having this copy of the
   object written to the current directory. Note that the server
   originating the orphan may no longer exist in the organization.

   Hide from AB: This can be tricky, because hidden objects will not be
   viewable by default. This can exacerbate "mysteriously recurring address
   book views". A Microsoft Knowledge Base article should be available on
   this topic soon.

   Object-Version: This is an object-specific, monotonically increasing
   value for an object - organization wide. If an object has fully
   replicated throughout the organization, all directories will have the
   same value in this attribute. If an object is orphaned in numerous
   places, then determine which of orphans maintains the "highest" Object-
   Version value. If re- creating the original object (option #1 above)
   modify the re-created object until its Object-Version exceeds the
   highest value found among the orphans. This will ensure that the orphan
   will later be successfully deleted throughout the organization.

   When-Created - date\timestamp the object was created.

   When-Changed - date\timestamp of the most recent replica update.
