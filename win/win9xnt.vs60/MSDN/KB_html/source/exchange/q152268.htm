The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you send mail to a Microsoft Mail user by means of the MS Mail
Connector Interchange (MSMI), the MSMI will not set the Custom Recipient’s
SNADS address as the Reply To address. Instead, the MSMI uses a Microsoft-
type address.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Messages sent through the MSMI are always sent with a Microsoft-type Reply
To address, unless the sender does not have a Microsoft-type address, in
which case an X.400-type address will be set as the Reply To address.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Apply the fix referenced below.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange version
4.0.
A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested
and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem.
Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix.
Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
A hotfix is now available from Microsoft that allows the MSMI to be set to
send the SNADS address as the Reply To address. With the hotfix installed,
the following registry value will be read:
<P>
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
<PRE>  SYSTEM
    CurrentControlSet
      Services
        MSExchangeMSMI
          Parameters

</PRE>Value Name: Send SNADS as Reply-To
Data Type: REG_DWORD
<P>
If this registry value is not present or is set to 0, the MSMI will always
send the Microsoft-type address as the Reply To if the sender has a
Microsoft-type defined.
<P>
If this registry value is present and set to 1, the MSMI will attempt to
send the message with a Reply To of SNADS if the sender has a SNADS address
defined, if not, it will revert back to the old behavior and send the
message with the Reply To set as Microsoft-type.
<P>
NOTE: Each Microsoft Mail postoffice receiving these messages will need to
have the SNADS access component installed in order to reply to these
messages.
