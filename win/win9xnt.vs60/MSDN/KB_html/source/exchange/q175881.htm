The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
It is possible to configure a Microsoft Exchange View Only Administrator
(VOA) at the Microsoft Exchange Site level for accounts that you want to 
be able to view the configuration of a Microsoft Exchange Server, but not 
be able to modify it. This article discusses the complications in 
configuring VOAs that arise due to fact that the Microsoft Mail Connector 
does not store most of its configuration in the Microsoft Exchange 
Directory, like other Microsoft Exchange Server objects.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If the VOA is also a Windows NT Domain Administrator, they will also be 
able to modify the Microsoft Mail Connector properties. This is because the 
Microsoft Mail Connector does not read the permissions set in the Microsoft 
Exchange Directory like other Microsoft Exchange Server objects. The Microsoft
Mail Connector stores most of its configuration information in the Windows NT
Registry and in the Microsoft Mail Connector Postoffice.
<P>
Upon opening the Microsoft Mail Connector properties, the Windows NT Service 
Control Manager (SCM) permissions are checked. If there is administrator 
access to the SCM, the Microsoft Mail Connector properties page is opened with 
full read-write access. If there is read-only access to the SCM, the Microsoft
Mail Connector is opened in read-only mode and changes to the configuration are 
not possible.
<P>
Because read-only or read-write access to the Microsoft Mail Connector properties 
page is determined by the Windows NT level of access to the SCM, the following 
four cases exist. Relevant workarounds are detailed as appropriate and can be 
implemented to bring the Microsoft Mail Connector access in line with that of the 
Microsoft Exchange Server Site permissions.
<P>
- CASE 1: Windows NT Administrator and Microsoft Exchange View Only Administrator
<P>
<PRE>  Assign read-only access to the Microsoft Exchange Connector Postoffice share 
  (\\exchsrvr\maildat$) for all VOAs. This simulates another account already 
  administering the Microsoft Mail Connector because the Flag.glb file cannot be
  locked for write access. The Microsoft Mail Connector's properties page will
  be opened in read-only mode. When this happens, the following dialog will be 
  displayed:

     An instance of the Administrator program is already running
     against the MS Mail Connector. You can view the configuration
     information, but you cannot edit it.

  Alternatively, the VOA can have it's Windows NT Administrator access restricted 
  to Windows NT User access.

</PRE>- CASE 2: Windows NT Administrator and Microsoft Exchange Administrator
<P>
<PRE>  The behaviour here is as expected and no alterations are needed.

</PRE>- CASE 3: Windows NT User and Microsoft Exchange View Only Administrator
<P>
<PRE>  The behaviour here is as expected and no alterations are required.

</PRE>- CASE 4: Windows NT User and Microsoft Exchange Administrator
<P>
<PRE>  In this case, the Microsoft Exchange Administrator will not be able to administer 
  the Microsoft Mail Connector properties because they will not have the appropriate 
  SCM access. Full Windows NT Administrator permissions will be needed if this 
  account is to be able to administer the Microsoft Mail Connector properties.
