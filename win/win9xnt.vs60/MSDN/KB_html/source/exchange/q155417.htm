<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes what the Microsoft Exchange Server Load Simulation
Tool, LoadSim.exe, was designed to do and what it's software and hardware
requirements are. For more information, please see the documentation on the
Microsoft Exchange Server CD, Support\LoadSim\LoadSim.doc, and the MS
Exchange Performance: Concurrent Users Per Server whitepaper available on
the Microsoft TechNet CD.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
As a performance tool, LoadSim is primarily used to help answer the
question: How many users per server does a Microsoft Exchange Server
Support? This tool can be used to generate a graph of perceived client
response time as a function of the number of active users.
<P>
LoadSim was designed to provide a realistic load on a Microsoft Exchange
Server by simulating the behavior of multiple Microsoft Exchange clients.
LoadSim takes advantage of the multithreading, multiprocessing, and shared
memory features in Windows NT to create and manage up to several hundred
simulated users on a single client computer. However, if you want to run a
large test (several hundred users or more), you'll need multiple LoadSim
client computers.
<P>
Tests
<P>
You can use LoadSim to specify and run three kinds of tests:
<P>
<PRE>   1. User Initialization, creates folders and messages in user mailboxes.
   2. Public Folder Initialization, sets up the Public Folder hierarchy.
   3. Load Simulation, simulates multiple users performing a wide variety
      of client actions including, reading mail, sending mail, Schedule+
      actions, and use of Public Folders. This test can be set to simulate
      low, medium, and heavy client usage.

</PRE>The first two tests are really just setup steps for the Load Simulation
test.
<P>
You can specify many different test configuration options in LoadSim to
simulate the type of activity you expect to see in production and you can
save each configuration to a separate .SIM file. This allows you to run a
particular configuration multiple times and to use LoadSim in automated
mode from the command-line.
<P>
Software Requirements
<P>
LoadSim should be run on Windows NT 3.51 or later. For demonstration
purposes, you can run LoadSim on Windows 95. However, if you are going to
run large tests, gather performance timing results, or perform directory
import, you need to use Windows NT. In addition, you must have a Microsoft
Exchange client installed on the computer running LoadSim.
<P>
Hardware Requirements
<P>
If you use LoadSim for performance analysis, you need to make sure that
your client hardware won't adversely affect performance results. The
response times reported by LoadSim for user actions should be based
primarily on server load, not client hardware bottlenecks. To gather
accurate performance timing data, your client computer should have at least
32 Mb of physical RAM. The number of simulated clients that can be
reasonably supported on one physical computer will vary with the nature of
users chosen. If, for example, you use the Medium default user setting, a
32 Mb client computer should support 100 simulated users with little or no
degradation in client response time.
<P>
There are several limiting factors that affect the capability of a
particular computer to support a particular type and number of LoadSim
users, the effects of these factors vary depending on your topology, your
hardware, and your user definitions; Some important considerations are:

<OL><P><LI>Network bandwidth. One of the differences between 100 real users and 100
   LoadSim users is that you can run all 100 LoadSim users on one computer.
   You should make sure the network hardware on your client computer(s) can
   handle the number of users per computer that you want to simulate.

<P><LI>Memory and pagefile size. Each LoadSim process, and, to a lesser degree,
   each thread in each LoadSim process uses some amount of system memory on
   its client computer, both in physical RAM and virtual memory. You can
   use the Windows NT Performance Monitor to make sure that your LoadSim
   users aren't using too much system memory or causing excessive pagefile
   activity on your client computer(s).

<P><LI>Disk I/O capacity. Some LoadSim user actions require disk access on the
   client computer. You should verify that your LoadSim users aren't
   exceeding the capacity of the I/O subsystem on each client computer.
