SYMPTOMS
 
<P>
After installing one of the custom applications located in the
Exchsrvr\Samples directory on the Microsoft Exchange Server, a client will
receive the following error when attempting to use one of these forms:
<P>
<PRE>   Unable to open &lt;form name&gt; Form&lt;s&gt; because some files are missing on
   your machine. The Microsoft Forms Designer tool must be installed.

</PRE>This error occurs even though a dialog was displayed telling the client
that the form has been installed on the computer.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When a form is installed on a client computer, only the main executable is
installed. Any supporting Dll’s will need to be installed to the client
computer by running the Microsoft Exchange Electronic Forms Designer (EFD)
Setup program.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
There are two methods of installing the supporting Dll’s without having to
keep the Microsoft Exchange EFD installed on the computer.
<P>
The first is to run the Microsoft Exchange EFD Setup program on the client
computer and then re-run setup and choosing to Remove All. This will
uninstall the Microsoft Exchange EFD, however, the supporting Dll's will
remain as they are considered shared components and are not removed.
<P>
The second method is to manually copy over the needed files from a computer
that has the Microsoft Exchange EFD installed. The necessary files are:
<P>
Dao2516.dll
Msajt200.dll
Vaen21.olb
Msjeterr.dll
Vbajet.dll
Msjetint.dll
Vbdb16.dll
<P>
Copy these 7 files into the &lt;winroot&gt;\system directory on Windows 95 or
Windows 3.x and to the &lt;winroot&gt;\system32 on Windows NT.
<P>
NOTE: Installing the 16-bit version of Microsoft Visual Basic 4.0 will also
place these files on the client computer.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 4.0 of Microsoft
Exchange. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
