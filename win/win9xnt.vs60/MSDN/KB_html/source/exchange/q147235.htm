<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Examining the distinguished name (DN) for a custom recipient created after
a directory synchronization (dirsync) cycle reveals that the DN includes a
common name (CN) composed of the original alias name plus hash code. The
following is an example:
<P>
<PRE>   /O=Enterprise/OU=Site/CN=JohnD324B43

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When an address is being imported into Microsoft Exchange via dirsync, the
directory exchange agent (DXA) creates the new custom recipient in the
directory. When doing so a relative distinguished name (RDN) is assigned to
it. Later, when an address on MS Mail changes, the DXA needs to be able to
find the original recipient that was created previously to be able to do
the modification or delete.
<P>
Since RDNs need to be unique within the container, and it is limited to 64
bytes, there has to be some way of guaranteeing this link. Thus, the hash
code which is a hashing of the address and the DN of the connection object
should never change.
<P>
This RDN could represent problems in certain situations. For example, if an
import file is used to modify the custom recipients created by dirsync,
then the RDN composed of the alias name and the hash code has to be
included in the import file for it to work. If not, a new set of addresses
will be created.
