The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server versions 4.0 and 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
You have a large number of Microsoft Exchange Server users who also have
Notes accounts. You perform directory synchronization (dirsync) and you
want the users to show up in Exchange Server with only one entry in the
Global Address List and you want to have all mail forwarded to the Exchange
Account.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The only way to perform this task is manually.

<OL><P><LI>From Notes you need to modify each user's Person Page. Change the
   Available For Dirsync field to NO and fill in the forward field with the
   Notes proxy address of the Exchange account. This Notes proxy address
   can be obtained from the e-mail message's Addresses tab for the relevant
   mailbox in the Exchange Server Administrator program. When the message
   arrives in Exchange Server, the From field will be, for example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      John Doe@Notes.
</PRE>
<P><LI>To prevent replies to these messages from leaving the Exchange system
   and being returned to Notes, you must create a secondary Notes proxy in
   Exchange Server that matches this address: John Doe @Notes. When
   Exchange Server receives the reply, it will resolve the destination
   locally.
<P>
