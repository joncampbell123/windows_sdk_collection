The information in this article applies to:

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
By default, the Microsoft Exchange Service Account can log in to any
mailbox. However, when a Service Account is used to log in to a mailbox,
this event should be logged in the Windows NT Application Event Log as
Event ID 1016 with the following text:
<P>
<PRE>   NT User ExchService logged on to ExUser1 mailbox, and is not the Primary
   Windows NT Account on this mailbox.

</PRE>where ExchService is the Service Account and ExUser1 is the mailbox that
the Service Account logs in to.
<P>
This information is logged whether or not you have logging turned on for
the Microsoft Exchange Private Information Store (IS). This information is
not always logged properly as in the following example:

<OL><P><LI>Turn off logging on the Private IS.
</OL>2. Log in as the Service Account (ExchService) and open the ExUser1
<PRE>   mailbox.

</PRE></OL>You initially get the following event logged in the Windows NT Event
Viewer:
<P>
<PRE>   EVENT ID: 1016
   NT User ExchService logged on to ExUser1 mailbox, and is not the Primary
   Windows NT Account on this mailbox.

</PRE><P><LI>In the Microsoft Exchange client, open the Tools menu, click Services,
</OL>click Exchange Server, click Properties, click Advanced Page, and add
ExUser2 mailbox to the list to open.
<P>
The Windows NT Event log will have the same entry:
<P>
<PRE>   EVENT ID: 1016
   NT User ExchService logged on to ExUser1 mailbox, and is not the Primary
   Windows NT Account on this mailbox.

</PRE></OL>The log message should say:
<P>
<PRE>   NT User ExchService logged on to ExUser2 mailbox, and is not the Primary
   Windows NT Account on this mailbox.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This is logged properly if logging is set to at least Minimum on the
Private IS, but will not be logged properly if logging is set to None.
<P>
