The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
You may find that a large number of messages with Read receipts and
Delivery receipts destined to go out the Microsoft Exchange Server version
4.0 Internet Mail Connector (IMC), or Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0
Internet Mail Service (IMS), slow down or halt the Microsoft Exchange
Server Message Transfer Agent (MTA).
<P>
If you stop and restart the MTA and IMC (or IMS), a few messages will be
delivered. From that point onward, delivery may be very slow or halted
outright. Symptoms can also include messages placed in the BAD queue.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This is caused by a corrupted application protocol data unit (APDU)
received from the MTA.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange versions
4.0 and 5.0.
<P>
For Microsoft Exchange Server version 4.0, this has been fixed in MTA build
996.25. Please contact Microsoft Technical Support for information on the 
availability of this fix.
<P>
This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange Server 5.0 U.S.
Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):
<P>
<PRE>   S E R V P A C K

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To install the fix for Microsoft Exchange Server version 4.0:

<OL><P><LI>Get the appropriate file from Microsoft Technical Support and unzip 
   it. There is no password on these files.
</OL>2. Install the new MTA by running the following command on the Microsoft
<PRE>   Exchange Server computer:

      hotfix /i

</PRE></OL>The retail symbols (BDB files, but renamed to DBG) are included. You will
need to install these manually into your Symbols directory.
<P>
Please note that this is also a problem on other platforms and localized
versions. If you need an Alpha version of the MTA (or a different localized
version), please contact Microsoft Technical Support.
<P>
How to find the MTA build number from the Event Logs:
<P>
The MTA automatically logs its build number in the NT Application Event Log
when the service is started. This information is written to Event ID 9298
and looks similar to the following:
<P>
