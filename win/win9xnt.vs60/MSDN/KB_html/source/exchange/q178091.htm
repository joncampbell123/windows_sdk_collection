The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
E-mail sent through the Internet Mail Service by a user with no valid
credentials on the Exchange Server computer causes the Internet Mail
Service to crash.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5.
A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested
and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem.
Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix.
Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If the “Clients can only submit if homed on this server” option is selected
on the Connections page of the Internet Mail Service properties,
authentication of inbound connections is required. However, you can bypass
this by using a per-host setting that allows a host to bypass the
authentication. This may be set in the “Accept Connections” dialog on the
Connections page.
<P>
Mail sent from the exempt host that fails the "homed on this server" check
will result in an Non-delivery report (NDR) to the administrator, which
will cause a crash because there is no authentication information.
<P>
The following event will be logged on the Exchange Server computer:
<P>
<PRE>   Event 4037
   MSExchangeIMC
   Error
   An exception has occurred which was handled internally by the Internet
   Mail Service. This may have resulted in a message not being delivered.
