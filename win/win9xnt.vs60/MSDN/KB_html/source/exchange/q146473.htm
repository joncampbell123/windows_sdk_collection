The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When the Microsoft Exchange Internet Mail Connector (IMC) receives a
message that contains a character set that is not installed, the content of
the message body is placed into an attachment containing the message. The
file will contain an attachment display name of "Charset = XXX" (for
example, Charset = iso-2022-JP).
<P>
This behavior does not give the recipient a clear indication of the reason
for the location of the message contents, or instructions to access the
attachment. The message is placed into the attachment (for example,
ATT00000.txt).
<P>
The contents of the attachment can be accessed by using a viewer that can
display the original character set.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Service Pack 1 for Microsoft Exchange contains a change in the way the IMC
handles body parts with unknown character sets. The body of an inbound non-
TNEF content conversion failure will be placed in one attachment and will
include the following text to provide further information:
<P>
<PRE>   This message was sent using a character set not supported on the
   Internet Mail Connector. The message text has been placed into an
   attachment. To view, double-click on the attachment. If the text isn't
   displayed correctly, save the attachment to disk, and then use a viewer
   that can display the original character set.

</PRE>The MS-DOS format 8.3 file name will be ATT00000.txt, where the number will
increment depending on the number of messages delivered. The displayname
"charset =" is designed to help determine the character sets indicated by
the message body.
<P>
The body of an inbound TNEF content conversion failure will include at
least two attachments. One attachment will include the first body part and
have a standard text name and an attachment display name of "char = XXX" to
indicate a character set was used that was not recognized (for example,
ATT00000.txt; charset = ISO-2022-JP). The second attachment will contain
the second body part and message content (for example, message.txt). The
two attachments will be separated by the following message for
clarification:
<P>
<PRE>   The Internet Mail Connector received a message that could not be
   processed. View the original content by opening the attached message.
