The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 (RC2)
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The backup program in Microsoft Exchange version 4.0 does not have the
capability of backing up and restoring individual mailboxes. This article
describes how you can work around this limitation and recover deleted items
from backup.
<P>
Microsoft Exchange Administrators sometimes need to be able to recover an
individual item from backup. For example, there may be a need to restore a
deleted users mail, or to recover a deleted mail message or a deleted
folder. In each of these cases, the only option is to recover the deleted
item from a backup.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
It is possible to recover an individual item (mailbox, folder, or message)
from a backed up Microsoft Exchange Information Store by following the
steps below. Please read all eight steps once before you start implementing
them:

<OL><P><LI>Install a Microsoft Exchange Server on another computer. The same 
   computer name is not required but you must give it the same organization
   and site name as the tape being restored. In addition, do not replicate
   this new server to the site. You must select the Create a New Site
   option.

<P><LI>Using Windows NT Backup, restore the information store and type the
   alternate server name for the destination server in the "Restore
   Information" dialog box.

<P><LI>Start the services on the alternate server. You can do this
   automatically by selecting Start Service After Restore in step 2.

<P><LI>In the Administrator program, locate the DS/IS Consistency Adjustment
   in the Advanced property page of the Server object. Choose All
   Inconsistencies, and choose Adjust.

<P><LI>Give yourself permission for the mailbox you want to restore from or for
   any mailbox if you are restoring a public folder.

<P><LI>Log on to the server with a Microsoft Exchange Client, and move the
   items to be restored into a .PST file.

<P><LI>Log on to an online server with a profile that also points to the .PST
   file used in the previous step.

<P><LI>Move the messages from the .PST file onto the online server.
<P></OL>
