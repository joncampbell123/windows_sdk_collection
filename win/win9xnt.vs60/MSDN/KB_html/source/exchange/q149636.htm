The Information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Exchange Windows 95 client, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When Microsoft Exchange Windows clients are used to add a public folder to
the public folder Favorites list, any subfolders of that public folder will
not be available through the Favorites list.
<P>
This is by design and has been implemented this way to reduce network
traffic.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
For example, consider the following public folder tree.
<P>
Public Folder A
<PRE>   Public Folder B
      Public Folder C

</PRE>If Public Folder A is added to the Favorites, upon selecting this folder
through the Favorites, its subfolders (Public Folder B and Public Folder C)
will not be seen.
<P>
The public folder tree could be physically on many different Microsoft
Exchange Servers, even though each user will only see one public folder
tree. If the Microsoft Exchange client displayed the folder hierarchy below
each public folder favorite and was notified of each addition to the public
folder (in order to display the folder name in boldface), each individual
user could have network connections to many different servers and receive
notifications of new items from all of them. As the number of users
increased, the network traffic generated by the public folder notifications
would increase. For organizations with tens of thousands of Microsoft
Exchange users, this network traffic could be significant.
