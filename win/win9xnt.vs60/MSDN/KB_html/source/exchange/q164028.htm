<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article will explain how to setup the Microsoft Exchange Server X.400
Connector to communicate with a Microsoft Mail 3.x X.400 Gateway server.
<P>
This article assumes that the both the Microsoft Mail X.400 Gateway and the
TP4 stack for that Gateway are fully operational. For assistance with that,
please consult the Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400 Administrator's Guide.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The first thing that needs to be done is to install the TP4 protocol for
Windows NT Server. The software for this protocol is located on both the
Windows NT Server compact disk and the Microsoft Exchange Server compact
disk. This article will be based upon using the one on the Microsoft
Exchange Server compact disk.
<P>
To install the protocol, open the Control Panel, double-click the Network
icon, and add a protocol. Select the Other option (Have Disk under NT 4.0)
and give the path to the TP4 installation directory. This should be similar
to:
<P>
<PRE>   X:\TP4SETUP\&lt;cputype&gt;

</PRE>Once the protocol is installed, it will display the TP4 configuration
dialog box. By default the Local Address and NSAP are identical to the name
of the Windows NT Server. This will need to be changed in order to connect
to the Microsoft Mail Gateway because this gateway, like many other older
messaging systems, requires HEX NSAPS as defined in ISO 8348.
<P>
The first piece of information needed is the MAC address for the Windows NT
Server's network card. The easiest way to find this out is to run IPCONFIG
/ALL at a command prompt. This will show the Physical Address of the card
such as:
<P>
<PRE>   Physical Address: 00-C0-4F-C3-2B-46

</PRE>The formula for creating a HEX NSAP is as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   Octet 0-1 is the Authority and Format Identifier. 49 is for locally
   assigned values

   Octet 2-5 is the Subnet ID

   Octet 6-17 is the MAC address

   Octet 18-19 is the NSAP selector, generally 01.

</PRE>Based on the above formula, the NSAP for the above Physical address would
be - 49000000C04FC32B4601
<P>
<PRE>   49 is local authority ID
   0000 is subnet ID (under most instances this will be 0000)
   00C04FC32B46 is the MAC address
   01 is the NSAP selector

</PRE>In the TP4 configuration dialog, the Local Address and NSAP would be
entered as the same value and would like this:
<P>
<PRE>   Local Address
   $49000000C04FC32B4601

   NSAP
   $49000000C04FC32B4601

</PRE>It is very important to add the '$' in front of the HEX ID because this
tells the protocol to pass the HEX value and not the ASCII value of the
address.
<P>
This is also the address that will need to be entered under the Remote MTA
setup for the Microsoft Mail Gateway for X.400.
<P>
The next step is to setup the X.400 Connector in the Microsoft Exchange
Administrator program. Most of the information for doing this is available
in Chapter 8 'Using the X400 to Connect Sites or Foreign Systems' of the
Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator's Guide.
<P>
The areas that need special attention are the Stack and Advanced tabs of
the X.400 connector.
<P>
On the Stack Tab, the NSAP of the Microsoft Mail X.400 Gateway server will
need to be entered. This can be obtained from the Microsoft Mail X.400
Admin program. Also, any TSAP, SSAP, or other information may be entered
here if it is required by the Microsoft Mail X.400 Gateway installation.
<P>
On the Advanced Tab, the following options need to be set
<P>
<PRE>   MTA conformance needs to be set to 1984
   Clear all boxes under X400 Link Options.

</PRE>All other selections may be left at defaults.
