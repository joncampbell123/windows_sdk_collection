<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you set up the Internet Mail Service on one computer running Microsoft
Exchange Server as Inbound only and another Exchange Server computer as
Outbound only, you may experience a problem with non-delivery reports
(NDRs) being dropped and not sent to the correct recipient. The
administrator for the Internet Mail Service on the inbound-only server
might receive a report from the outbound-only Exchange server stating:
<P>
<PRE>   Reason: Proxy address not found.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The information store is treating the NDR report destination or name as
X.400 instead of as an SMTP one-off and the X.400 address of the receiver
of this report is not listed in the directory. Normally an NDR report gets
sent to the originator of the original message. In this case the
originator's address was converted to X.400 and caused the IMS to fail to
send the NDR. The NDR is then dropped and a problem report is sent to the
IMS administrator on the Inbound Only Exchange server.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0.
This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on obtaining the
Service Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
(without the spaces):
S E R V P A C K
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
