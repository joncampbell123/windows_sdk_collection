The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client version 5.0
- Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client version 5.0
- Microsoft Exchange Windows 95 client version 5.0
 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After a mailbox is moved between two servers in the same Exchange site, and
the client profile is updated properly by the original Exchange Server
computer, Exchange Client cannot connect to the new server using the Domain
Name Service (DNS) fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the new Exchange
Server computer when the original server is offline.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
After a mailbox is moved successfully between two Exchange Server computers
in the same site, the Exchange Client connects to the original server and,
at that time, the client profile is updated properly. After the client
profile is updated, any subsequent logon to the mailbox does not require
the original server.
<P>
During the profile update, several registry keys are updated. One of these
registry keys holds the FQDN for the new server. However, this key does not
get updated during the client profile update. As a result, a user cannot
access the mailbox if DNS is the only name resolution mechanism and if the
original server is offline.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
You can work around this problem by manually updating the profile by
performing checkname:
<PRE>   1. Click the Mail and Fax icon in Control Panel.
   2. Select Microsoft Exchange Server.
   3. Click the Check Names button.

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Exchange version 5.0.
<P>
This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on obtaining the
Service Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge 
Base (without the spaces):
<P>
<PRE>   S E R V P A C K

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The key below holds the profile information for an Exchange Client:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_USERS\&lt;SID&gt;\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows
   Messaging Subsystem\Profiles\&lt;Profile
   Name&gt;\13dbb0c8aa05101a9bb000aa002fc45a

</PRE>The following values are used to store the server name:
<P>
001e6602 stores the NetBIOS computer name where the mailbox is located and
is updated correctly when the mailbox is moved.
<P>
001e6608 stores the TCP/IP address, the NetBIOS computer name, or the DNS
FQDN used to create the initial profile. It is not updated when the mailbox
is moved or profile checkname is performed.
<P>
101e6613 stores network names according to MSRPC binding names (obtained
from network address attributes on server objects in DSA). It is not
updated when the mailbox is moved but is updated when profile checkname is
performed manually.
<P>
The value 101e6613 is the one that needs to be updated to make sure that
the FQDN for the new server gets updated in the profile.
