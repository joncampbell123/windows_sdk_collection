<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you add a new mailbox to a computer running Microsoft Exchange Server
and the name includes an extended character such as an "a" or an "o" with
an umlaut, the character is converted to ae or oe (respectively) in the
X.400 and SMTP proxy addresses. This also happens with the generation of
the common name. This is correct for German names but it is incorrect for
Scandinavian names. To make sense to Scandinavian users, these characters
should instead be converted to a and o.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0.
A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-
tested and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific
problem. Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem,
Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains
this fix. Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
After the fix is applied, in generating proxy addresses, the mapping of the
extended characters will be based on the Microsoft Exchange Server locale,
not where the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program is running.
However, when generating the common name, the mapping will be based on the
locale where the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program is
running.
<P>
The fix eliminates the unwanted character mapping. The following languages
(locales) trigger the conversion of extended characters in a way that makes
sense to Scandinavian users:
