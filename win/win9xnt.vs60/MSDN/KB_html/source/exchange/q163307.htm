<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Exchange Message Transfer Agent (MTA) logs information
related to its various queues by object ids, beginning with 01 and followed
by 6 more hexidecimal digits.
<P>
To identify the queue that an object id corresponds to, you can check a
recent Mtacheck.log for secured queues (queues written to disk).
<P>
For queues that are created in computer memory (unsecured) each time the
MTA is started a careful inspection of detailed logs can often be used to
identify the queue's name and purpose.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Knowing the purpose and name of a queue associated with one or more errors
may help narrow the problem during troubleshooting.
<P>
The following procedure may help if you get an error on one or more objects
where the error refers to a queue that doesn't show up when you check the
latest Mtacheck.log or you get several errors each on a different message
object but always on the same queue object.
<P>
Often a description of the queue or its purpose can be determined with the
following procedure.
<P>
Preliminary Requirement:
<P>
The Application log must still contain the MTA startup sequence with
logging for Field Engineering at Maximum or higher. If the log does not
contain the information, you will need to verify the logging level and
restart the MTA.
<P>
Methodology:

<OL><P><LI> Note the full object id for the queue, for example: 01000034.
</OL>2.  Highlight the oldest event in the application log.
3.  Perform a Find from the View menu with the following criteria:
<P>
<PRE>       Event ID: 2164
       Description: 01000034   (use whatever the id you noted in step 1)
       Search Direction: Up

</PRE><P><LI>Look for the first 285 Field Engineering event written after the 2164
   you found above.
<P>
   Be careful of the sequence. Often, several 2164's and 285's are
   written back to back. For each pair, the 2164 is written first and
   then the 285.

<P><LI>Look in the Description of the 285 event for the queue's name and
   purpose.
<P>
   In some cases it may appear that 3 queues are created for the same
   purpose. If you look closely you will see that there are different
   queues to the same location for priority 0, 1, and 2 messages.
<P>
   For example:
<P>
<P><PRE>    A priority 1 held-for-delivery/transfer queue for
    /O=MICROSOFT/OU=BOND007/CN=CONFIGURATION/CN=SERVERS/CN=DRNO/
    CN=MICROSOFT PRIVATE MDB was created and given the 52 identifier.
    [MTA MAIN BASE 1 213] (8)
</PRE><P>
   While 285 events are the most common, they are not always present.
   If you don't find a 285, look for any 3535 or 3536 events in place of
   the 285s.
