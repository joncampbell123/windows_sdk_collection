<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you review Windows NT Event Viewer files on a different computer than
the file was originally created on, you might see the following as part of
the description:
<P>
<PRE>   The description for Event ID ( XXX ) in Source ( YYY ) could not be
   found. It contains the following insertion string(s): ZZZ

</PRE>where XXX is the actual number for the event id, YYY is the service source
name that logged the error, and YYY can be any string of data.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The above text appears when the Event Viewer cannot find the source file
for the actual description of a message (usually a DLL). It can also occur
when the message was generated by an installed service which is part of
another component.
<P>
This problem is very common when viewing event log entries for instances of
the Microsoft Exchange PCMTA. For example, if there is a particular
Microsoft Exchange Server that has the MSMail Connector installed and has
an instance of PCMTA called "MTA to Vancouver PO", and you try to view
event log entries for this PCMTA on a different computer that does not have
an instance with this same name, you will see the above description.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
On a computer that has the MSMail Connector installed, create a temporary
instance of "MTA to Vancouver PO". There is no need to configure or start
the service.
<P>
-or-
<P>
Close and reopen the event viewer on the remote computer to refresh the
screen.
