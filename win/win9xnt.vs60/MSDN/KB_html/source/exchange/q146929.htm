<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0 and 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
A foreign message transfer agent (MTA), for example, the Olivetti MTA, may
be unable to correlate a read receipt (also known as a read notification
[RN]) back to the original message. For example, this may occur with a
message sent from Microsoft Exchange Server to a foreign MTA by means of a
1984 X.400 Connector.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The read receipt sent by Microsoft Exchange Server does not include the
ORName within the reported IPMessageId if this ORName is part of the
original message.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
If the foreign MTA allows it, configure the MTA to not include the ORName
in the IPMessageId.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0.
A supported fix to this problem is in development, but has not been fully
regression-tested and should be applied only to systems experiencing this
specific problem. Unless you are severely impacted by this specific
problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that
contains this fix. Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information
on the availability of this fix.
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0.
This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange 5.0 Server U.S.
Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
According to the CITT's 1984 X series of recommendations (also known as the
Red Book), this behavior does not conform to the 1984 X.420
recommendations. Recommendation X.420, p. 192,states that the IPMessageId
is made up of the following two components:
<P>
<PRE>   ORNameOPTIONAL
   PrintableString

</PRE>Even though the ORName is an optional part in the IPMessageId, it must be
included in the read reciept's reported IPMessageId. The reported
IPMessageId must contain the IPMessageId as it was originally sent.
Recommendation X.420, 4.2.2.3, Table6.X.420, page 203, concerning
components of the interpersonal messaging (IPM) status report user agent
protocol data unit (SR-UAPDU), states:
<P>
<PRE>   This is the same identifier conveyed in the IM-UAPDU [IP-message user
   agent protocol data unit] to which the report refers. Exchange does not
   include the ORName into the reported IPMessageId but only sends back the
   PrintableString.

</PRE>For more information about SR-UAPDUs and read receipts, see the following
sections of the Red Book:
<P>
<PRE>   SR-UAPDU: Rec X.420, 3.3, page 190
   Receipt Notification: Rec X.420, 4.2.2.3, page 202

</PRE>The Olivetti MTA is manufactured by Olivetti, a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this
product's performance or reliability.
