<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Exchange client for Windows 95 might load slowly, or appear
to hang, if DNS is enabled for TCP/IP and no DNS server is available. This
might happen if a physical adapter is installed that does not use DNS and
there is a Dial-Up Adapter that uses DNS.
<P>
In Windows 95, the DNS setting is valid for all adapters that are present.
You cannot turn off DNS for one adapter and leave it on for another. It
might be necessary to manually disable DNS when switching between network
adapters in order for the Microsoft Exchange client for Windows 95 to load
without a delay.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Domain Name System (DNS) is used to identify computers on the Internet.
Windows 95 supports more than one network adapter for TCP/IP. The Dial-Up
Adapter allows Windows 95 to use a modem as a network adapter that can be
used to connect to the Internet with TCP/IP.
<P>
Usually, when connecting to the Internet with a Dial-Up Adapter, a DNS
server will be used as configured by choosing TCP/IP and the Dial-Up
Adapter in the Network applet of the Control Panel. However, enabling this
setting for the Dial-Up Adapter also enables it for all other adapters
configured to use TCP/IP.
<P>
If one adapter cannot access DNS, it will be necessary to disable DNS when
using that adapter. For example, if you use WINS for name resolution when
at work, but DNS when you connect to the Internet through Dial-Up
networking, you will need to disable DNS when at work. Re-enable DNS when
you connect to the Internet through Dial-Up networking.
<P>
The slowness may also be seen when a normally available DNS server is not
available. If you are not able to disable DNS, wait a few minutes for the
Microsoft Exchange client for Windows 95 to load after DNS fails.
