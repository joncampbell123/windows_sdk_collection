<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the Microsoft Exchange client for Windows 3.x, Windows 95, or
Windows NT, you can define rules to process received messages. You can
define these rules by using the Inbox Assistant.
<P>
When you run the Microsoft Exchange client in the Offline mode, rules that
move or copy messages into a local folder or a public folder cannot be
executed.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Inbox Assistant rules are normally executed on the Microsoft Exchange
Server.
<P>
However, rules that move or copy messages to local folders or public
folders cannot be executed on the server. The server creates a Deferred
Action Message when it encounters such a rule. This message is sent to the
client the next time it connects to the server. Upon receiving this message
the client executes the action specified in the message.
<P>
Deferred Action Messages cannot be processed when the client operates in
the Offline mode. These rule-actions will be processed the next time the
client connects in the Online mode.
<P>
To work around this problem, do not use a local *.PST file. Instead create
an offline store with replicas of all the server based folders. Create
Inbox Assistant rules to move/copy messages into the server based folders.
Since these rules operate on server based private folders, they will be
executed even when the client is not logged in. Log into the client in
Offline mode.
<P>
Select the Synchronize command from the Tools menu to synchronize the
online and offline folders. This will update all the local folders with the
messages in the server based folders.
