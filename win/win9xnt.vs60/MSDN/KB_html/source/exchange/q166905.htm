The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server versions 4.0 and 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article tells you how to change a user's target address or to view the
user's current target address or e-mail proxies.
<P>
Each user in the address book is either treated as a Local (mailbox) user
or a Custom Recipient located at another mail system. All users have e-
mail proxies for all the other connected systems.
<P>
When a user is defined as a Custom Recipient, the user's primary e-mail
address or Target Address determines the routing path and on which system
the user is located. There are also e-mail proxies of all the other
systems. This allows e-mail from SNADS to be easily routed through the
Exchange Server backbone to either cc:Mail or SMTP, or vice-versa.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To change a user's target address or to view the user's current target
address or e-mail proxies:

<OL><P><LI>In the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program, expand the left
   panel tree until you see the Recipients Container.

<P><LI>Select the Recipients Container by highlighting it. You should see a
   list of all users in the right pane of the Administrator.

<P><LI>To view a user, double-click that user.

<P><LI>At the bottom of the General property page there is a field called E-
   mail. If you click E-mail, the options to "Modify existing e-mail
   address" and "Create new e-mail address" appear.
<P>
   If the user is an SNADS user the address will be "SNADS:DGN(DEN)". If
   the user is a cc:Mail user it will be "CCMAIL:Username at Postoffice"

<P><LI>Change this to the new address.
<P>
</OL>If you would like to view a user's other proxies, select the e-mail
Addresses property page. This will show all the user's e-mail proxies.
<P>
To change the proxy, double click on the address you want to change, or if
you would like to create multiple proxies for one address type click on the
side button New. When you add more than one proxy of a single type one will
be the primary, and all others will be secondary proxies. Primary Proxies
are shown in bold type, Secondary proxies are shown in normal font. If more
than one proxy exists the Primary will always be used on outbound mail,
Secondary will be used only for inbound address mapping.
