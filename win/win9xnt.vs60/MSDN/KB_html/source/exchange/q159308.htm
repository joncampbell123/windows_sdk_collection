The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Directory synchronized names either never seem to get to Microsoft
Exchange Server, or names disappear after you perform a modify. This is
most commonly seen when a new user is added to the directory
synchronization (dir-sync) stream and then there is a modify transaction
containing template information.
<P>
If directory synchronized Custom Recipients were once in the Microsoft
Exchange Directory and have disappeared or some names are received by
Microsoft Exchange and seem to be discarded, you may be experiencing this
problem.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
In the Microsoft Mail dir-sync process, it is possible to send a (M)odify
transaction followed only by the new template information as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   A Leopard, Lady                  SNADS:NET/PO/LEOPARD
   M Leopard, Lady                  SNADS:NET/PO/LEOPARD
   Leopard, Lady                  SNADS:NET/PO/LEOPARD&lt;----Notice this is
   duplicate of line 1
    - Internal Mail Code:/1 and is not necessary on MSMail DirSync.
    - Department:/2
    - Division:/Testing
   A Lion, Leo                      SNADS:NET/PO/LIONLEO
   M Lion, Leo                      SNADS:NET/PO/LIONLEO
    - Internal Mail Code:/1
    - Department:/2
   - Division:/Testing

</PRE>Notice Leo Lion's (M)odify is not followed by a second line repeating his
friendly name/address information as Lady Leopard's (M)odify does. His
(M)odify transaction goes directly into the Template information changes.
<P>
Both of these (M)odify transactions are valid according to the Microsoft
Mail Dir-Sync Protocol but the (M)odify transaction is not being handled
properly by Exchange if it does not contain the friendly name/address
information repeated on the second line of the (M)odify transaction. Note:
this replication is not necessary, according to the Microsoft Mail Dir-
Sync Protocol, if the friendly name or address has not changed.
<P>
All Microsoft Mail postoffices and computers running Microsoft Exchange
Server will duplicate the friendly name/address information line as Lady
Leopard's (M)odify illustrates above. This problem is only seen when
manual Import.txt files are created and added to the dir-sync stream
manually or by an automated process written by you.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem:
<P>
Ensure that all (M)odify transactions destined for Exchange has the
friendly name/address information line repeated on line two of the
(M)odify transaction.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0.
This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange 4.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):
