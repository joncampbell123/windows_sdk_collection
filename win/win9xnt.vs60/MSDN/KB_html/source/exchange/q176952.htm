<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Automatically generated messages from an Australian X.400 ADMD are not delivered 
correctly to Microsoft Exchange Server. The messages are received by the Microsoft
Exchange Message Transfer Agent (MTA) but are not received by the end user. The 
following Event IDs will be logged in the Windows NT Server Event Viewer 
Application log:
<P>
<PRE>   Event ID:    296

   Source:      MSExchangeMTA
   Type:        Information
   Category:    X.400 Service

   PRIVATE MDB.  Entity is a Message  Object is a Normal Priority Message. 
   Object: 06000058. Message ID: C=au;A=otc;P=;L=97082616584041+20201E53
   Content length: 500, External Trace information (first 100 bytes) =

   6C30340000318080113937303832363138303033392B3130,  PDU dump reference 3839 
   [MTA SUBMIT 16 74] (14) 

   Event ID:    290
   Source:      MSExchangeMTA
   Type:        Warning
   Category:    X.400 Service
   Description: A non-delivery report (reason code transfer-failure and 
   diagnostic code invalid-arguments) is being generated for message 
   C=au;A=otc;P=;L=97082616584041+20201E53. It was originally destined for 
   DN:/o=ORG/ou=ORGUNIT/cn=RECIPIENTS/cn=WDCOOB§C=AU;A=TELEMEMO;P=PRMD;O=ORG;
   S=Surname;G=GivenName;I=Init; (recipient number 1), and was to be redirected
   to . [MTA DISP:RESULT 21 136] (12)

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
These messages are rejected by the Exchange Server because the transmitting 
system is including a null PRMD entry in the MTSID field of the message. If a 
PRMD field is present, this field should between 1 and 16 characters, not 
null. Since the PRMD specified by Telstra does not confirm to this, the message 
results in an NDR.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The X.400 ADMD in this case is TELEMEMO (or OTC) in Australia. Messages sent to:
<P>
<PRE>   C=AU;A=OTC;P=ENHANCED;O=Operations;S=AutoReply 

</PRE>should result in a message being returned to the original sender from the Auto 
Reply account. Similar automatically generated messages should result when 
sending a Telex message through this ADMD's system. Neither of these messages 
are delivered to an Exchange user.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
While Microsoft believes this to be a conformance issue with the X.400 Service 
providor, a workaround has been made available for Exchange Server, verions 
5.0 and 5.5
<P>
A supported fix is now available but has not been fully regression-tested
and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem.
Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix.
Contact Microsoft Product Support Services for more information.
