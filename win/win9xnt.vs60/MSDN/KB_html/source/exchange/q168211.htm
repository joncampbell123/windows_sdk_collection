The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it
if a problem occurs. For information on how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" online Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry
Key" online Help topic in Regedt32.exe.
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article discusses the registry entries for modifying the polling
frequencies of the Microsoft Exchange Connector for Lotus cc:Mail.
<P>
CAUTION: The default settings have been set to give the cc:Mail Connector
optimal performance. Please do not change these settings unless absolutely
necessary. Modifying these settings could adversely affect the performance
of the connector.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Several registry values control when and how the cc:Mail connector service
activates and the amount of processing it performs.
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall Windows. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be
solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and
Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" online Help
topics in Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before
you edit it.
<P>
Registry entries that control the connector are found in the following
registry location:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeCCMC\
   Parameters

</PRE>The entry for the polling interval at which the Export.exe program runs is:
<P>
<PRE>   Second to wait before EXPORT

</PRE>and the default is 15 seconds.
<P>
The entry for the polling interval at which the Import.exe program runs is:
<P>
<PRE>   Second to wait before IMPORT

</PRE>and the default is 15 seconds.
<P>
The entry for the number of messages to request from cc:mail Export for
each activation is:
<P>
<PRE>   Maximum number of messages to EXPORT

</PRE>and the default is 16.
<P>
The entry for the number of messages to Import to cc:mail on each Import
activation is:
<P>
<PRE>   Maximum number of messages to IMPORT

</PRE>and the default is 5.
<P>
By default, the Connector service checks the Import directory and the
cc:mail post office every 15 seconds, in accordance with the settings in
the first two registry entries above (Second to wait before EXPORT and
Second to wait before IMPORT). If there are messages awaiting delivery,
the connector service requests 16 or 5 messages to be delivered, in
accordance with the second set of registry entries (Maximum number of
messages to EXPORT and Maximum number of messages to IMPORT).
<P>
If the maximum number of messages processed during the Import or Export
session is equal to the registry value, the server immediately processes
another session. By immediately processing again when the maximum number
of messages are present, the connector can continually move messages
when there is a backlog. If the number of messages is less than the
default value, no additional processing occurs until the time interval
expires.
