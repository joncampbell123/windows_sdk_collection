<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article tells you how to allow the Microsoft Exchange Client to 
connect to Microsoft Exchange Server over an existing connection to the
Internet and through a firewall. In order to do this, make the ports
assigned to these connections static. This requires you to add entries to
the registry.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The computer must be restarted for these changes to take effect.
<P>
To make the ports static:
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall Windows NT. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved.
Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

<OL><P><LI>Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

<P><LI>Under the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following subkey:

<P><PRE>      System\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeDS\Parameters

<P><PRE>      TCP/IP port REG_DWORD
      DATA: &lt;port number to assign&gt;
</PRE><P>
   NOTE:  DO NOT assign ports immediately above the 1023 range. For more

<P>
</OL>After this, you will need to configure the packet filter (or firewall) to
allow TCP connections to be made to these ports as well as to port 135.
<P>
<P><h3>Further Explanation</h3>
 
<P>
A packet filter (or firewall) will deny connection attempts made to any
port for which you have not explicitly allowed connections. Microsoft
Exchange Server does use a well-known static port (port 135) to listen for
client connects to the RPC Endpoint Mapper Service. However, after the
client connects to this socket, Microsoft Exchange Server then re-assigns
the client two random ports to use when communicating with the Directory
and the Information Store. This makes it impossible to allow these through
the firewall without forcing them to be statically assigned.
