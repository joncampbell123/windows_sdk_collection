<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In the Microsoft Exchange and Microsoft Outlook clients, it is not possible
to open a read-only Personal Folder (.PST) or Personal Address Book (PAB)
file.
<P>
You may receive the following error message if you attempt to open a read-
only .PST file:
<P>
<PRE>   Unable to display the folder. File access is denied. You do not have the
   permission required to access the file C:\Outlook\outlook.pst

</PRE>You may receive the following error message if you attempt to access a read-
only Personal Address Book (PAB) file:
<P>
<PRE>   Your personal address book could not be opened. The file is either not
   accessible or is not a personal address book. Choose Retry to use your
   personal address book, or choose Cancel to not use your personal address
   book with this application.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design. Because of the way that the Microsoft Exchange
and Microsoft Outlook clients access these files, .PST and PAB files must
be opened for read/write access in order to function properly.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
If possible, remove the read-only attribute of the file prior to opening
it. If the file is located on a shared network drive or on a CD-ROM drive,
copy the file to your local hard drive and verify that the read-only
attribute is not set.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior usually occurs when a user attempts to access a .PST or PAB
file located on a shared read-only drive or a file located on a CD-ROM
drive.
