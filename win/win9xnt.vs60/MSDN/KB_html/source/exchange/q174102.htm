The information in this article applies to:
<P>
-  Microsoft Exchange Server versions 4.0 and 5.0
<P>
 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
You find that messages are not flowing from OV/VM to Exchange through the
LinkAge Exchange-OV/VM (or LinkAge PROFS) Connector and you get the
following error messages in the Application Event log:
<P>
<PRE>   The description for Event ID ( 1 ) in Source ( LSIControl ) could not be
   found. It contains the following insertion string(s): ENS, 1997/09/05
   03:15:37- LME-PROFS-DIAMEX(01e8) 1 40720:Error {CT:160()} finding
   correlation table record.

<P>
<PRE>   The description for Event ID ( 1 ) in Source ( LSIControl ) could not be
   found. It contains the following insertion string(s): ENS, 1997/09/05
   03:15:37- LME-PROFS-DIAMEX(01e8) 1 04065:Critical error: Queue item
   handle passed to QMMarkQItemBad is invalid.

</PRE>You will also find that the OV/VM to Exchange Transform process is not
running, and you see the following messages in the Linkage Browse log:
<P>
<PRE>   LME-PROFS-DIAMEX 40720: Error {CT:160()} finding correlation table
   record
   LME-PROFS-DIAMEX 56074: {I/O error has occurred}: Could not find CT
   record
   for '1997090310234541 server.org '
   LME-PROFS-DIAMEX 04065: Critical error: Queue item handle passed to
   QMMarkQItemBad is invalid
   LME-PROFS-DIAMEX 00514: A RESTART request has been received
   LME-PROFS-DIAMEX 00505: LME-PROFS-DIAMEX is ending, last return code was
   {A
   shutdown request was made}

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
A possible cause may be a corrupted correlation table.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Stop the Linkage Controller service. This will stop the OV/VM Connector
   and the SNADS Connector (if present).
</OL>2. Move the Ct2.idx, Ct2.dat, and Ctlock.dat files from the
<PRE>   c:\linkage\tables directory into a backup directory.
</PRE></OL>3. Delete the Ct2.idx, Ct2.dat, and Ctlock.dat files (the Ctlock.dat file
<PRE>   may not be present) from the c:\linkage\tables directory.
</PRE>4. Restart the LinkAge Controller and Connector services. The correlation
<PRE>   tables will be rebuilt.

</PRE>NOTE: There are no tools available that will repair a damaged correlation
table; currently rebuilding the table is the only known fix for this issue.
Damaged correlation tables (the files that make up the correlation tables)
should be sent to Microsoft Support for cause analysis through the normal
channels.
