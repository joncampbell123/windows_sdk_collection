The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Exchange Server version 4.0 Service Pack 3 (SP3) may not
correctly detect whether or not the server it is being applied to has
already had Service Pack 2 (SP2) applied to it. The SP3 Update.exe proceeds
with the installation, without issuing a warning message that SP2 has not
been correctly applied.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
If SP2 is removed from a Microsoft Exchange Server computer by clicking
Remove All from within the Microsoft Exchange Server Setup program, not all
registry keys associated with this installation are removed. Specifically,
the key that stores the currently installed server and SP version
information remains. If a fresh copy of Microsoft Exchange Server is then
installed on this Windows NT Server, the SP3 Update.exe will not detect
that this server has not had SP2 correctly applied to it, and the SP3
Update.exe proceeds without warning.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
If the server you are upgrading had an SP2 installation removed, make sure
you re-apply SP2 before applying SP3.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
