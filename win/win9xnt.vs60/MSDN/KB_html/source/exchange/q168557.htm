The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server versions 4.0 and 5.0
</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
There is a difference between non-delivery-reports (NDRs) on messages to
Internet users with an incorrect domain name and NDRs on messages to
Internet users with a correct domain name, but incorrect user name.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The NDR on a message with an incorrect domain name looks like the
following:
<P>
<PRE>   Your message did not reach some or all of the intended recipients.

   Subject:hello there
      Sent: 3/27/97 11:18 AM

   The following recipient(s) could not be reached:

      'TEST@JUNK.TEST.CA' on 3/27/97 11:18 AM
            The recipient name is not recognized
            MSEXCH:IMC:LINKAGE:Toronto:WWW 3902 Host Unknown

</PRE>This is a common error; it is most likely due to a sender's addressing
error. You receive this message back from the System Administrator when you
have sent e-mail to a domain name (for example, JUNK.TEST.CA) that does not
exist on the Internet. The Internet has "Global" Domain Name Servers that
resolve Domain Names to systems. If this domain name is not found, it
cannot be routed any further.
<P>
An NDR on a message with the correct domain name but the incorrect user
name looks like the following:
<P>
<PRE>   Your message did not reach some or all of the intended recipients.

      To: 'hello@cibc.ca'
      Subject: test
      Sent: 3/27/97 11:21:30 AM

   The following recipient(s) could not be reached:

      hello@cibc.ca on 3/27/97 11:21:30 AM
            Recipient Not Found
            MSEXCH:IMC:CIBC:SCCB:NT70177PDC

</PRE>This error is a "Recipient Not Found" error. The mail got to the other
system, but the username (Hello, in this example) did not exist. This error
is again most likely due to a sender's addressing error. Check the address
again, and resend.
