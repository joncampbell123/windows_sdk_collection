</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Outlook 8.03 clients for Windows 3.1x and Macintosh operating
systems improve messaging and group scheduling interoperability with
Microsoft Outlook 97 (for Windows 95) without requiring new hardware for
users of Windows 3.1x or the Macintosh. These new Microsoft Outlook clients
are appropriate for customers with Microsoft Exchange Server who need
"stepping stone" clients as they migrate to Windows 95 operating systems.
<P>
Customers committed to staying on the Macintosh or Windows 3.1x platforms
for the long term may want to consider using Microsoft Outlook Express for
messaging and the Microsoft Outlook Web Access (OWA) client for scheduling.
Microsoft will continue to support the Macintosh and Windows 3.1x versions
of the Microsoft Exchange and Microsoft Schedule+ 7.x clients.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Outlook clients for Windows 3.1x and Macintosh include all
the features of the existing Microsoft Exchange and Schedule+ clients, plus
new features to smooth interoperability with existing versions of Microsoft
Outlook 97. Due to operating system and hardware limitations of typical
computers based on Windows 3.1x and Macintosh, these clients continue to
provide only a subset of the features found in the 32-bit version of
Microsoft Outlook. Please note that these two clients do not support
connectivity to Microsoft Mail for PC Networks or cc:Mail.
<P>
<P><h2>FEATURES</h2>
 
<P>
The following new features are included in the Microsoft Outlook 8.03 for
Windows 3.1x and Macintosh clients:
<P>
<P><h3>E-mail Interoperability Improvements</h3>
 
Users can now send and receive flagged messages, recall messages, and
respond to (but not send) voting messages. Microsoft has also improved
attachment handling and translation for Macintosh users. These clients are
intended for Microsoft Exchange Server integration only and do not include
Internet mail (POP, IMAP4) support required to directly connect to an
Internet service provider. Users of Windows 3.x and Macintosh who require
POP3 support are encouraged to evaluate the Microsoft Outlook Express
client, scheduled to be available later this year.
<P>
<P><h3>Calendar and Group Scheduling</h3>
 
By default, the Windows 3.x and Macintosh versions of Microsoft Outlook can
only view Microsoft Schedule+ 7.x data of other users. However, a client
extension is available for the Outlook Windows 3.x client that provides the
ability to view the details of an Outlook Windows 95 user's Calendar
folder. This add-on, called the Schedule+ Exchange Transport DLL, is
located on the Microsoft Exchange 5.5 Client Pack CD in the following
directory:
<P>
<PRE>   \Support\MSOUTL\Win16

</PRE>NOTE: This add-on is not available for the Macintosh client. Therefore,
Macintosh clients cannot view the Calendar data of other Outlook users.
They can view Free/Busy information.
<P>
The clients continue to have exactly the same Calendar, Contacts, and Task
features that are available in Schedule+ version 7.0, and the clients will
continue to display Calendar, Contacts, and Task information in a separate
window, accessible through the Calendar icon on the Outlook Bar.
<P>
<P><h3>Opening Microsoft Exchange Server HTML Forms</h3>
 
Outlook electronic forms created using the built-in Outlook forms design
tool can only be used on Windows 95 desktops where Outlook is installed.
However, Microsoft Exchange Server provides an alternative way to create
forms for use in collaborative applications - using Active Server Pages and
the Microsoft Exchange Collaboration Data Objects (CDO) interface to script
forms that are displayed as HTML in a Web browser. All three versions of
Outlook in Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 (Outlook 97 8.03, Outlook for
Windows 3.1x, and Outlook for Macintosh) have been extended to support
Microsoft Exchange Server HTML forms. These features provide Exchange sites
with more options for developing and deploying electronic forms.
<P>
All three versions of Outlook in Microsoft Exchange 5.5 contain a new menu
item on the Compose menu, Open Web Form, that lets users invoke a Microsoft
Exchange Server HTML form. When a user selects this menu item, the Web
browser registered on the user's computer is automatically opened and
directed to an internal Web site containing a directory of HTML forms. The
URL that locates the directory of HTML forms can be set as an option and
can be set in registry keys by the system administrator.
<P>
Currently, when an Outlook form is sent to the Windows 3.x or Macintosh
client, it is essentially unusable - opening the item in the Windows 3.x or
Macintosh Inbox does not display the actual form, as the form designer
intended. However, with Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5, the Windows 3.x and
Macintosh clients will automatically start an associated HTML form through
the browser when a user opens an Outlook form from the Inbox, provided
Outlook Web Access is installed and enabled on the server. This HTML form
is created as an additional design step and is not automatically generated
during the design of the Outlook form. The Microsoft Exchange Server
administrator associates the HTML form with the appropriate Outlook form
message class.
<P>
<P><h3>Improved User Interface</h3>
 
Outlook for Windows 3.1x and the Macintosh includes a partially
customizable Outlook Bar and a Folder Banner consistent with Outlook 97.
Menu and toolbar commands are now arranged to more closely match Outlook
97.
<P>
<P><h2>Architecture and System Requirements</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Server Requirements</h3>
 
Standard e-mail and group scheduling require Microsoft Exchange Server 4.0
or later. To implement custom forms using HTML and Microsoft Exchange
Server CDO requires Microsoft Exchange Server 5.0 SP1 or later, and
Microsoft Internet Information Server 3.0 with Active Server Pages
installed.
<P>
<P><h3>Client Requirements</h3>
 
Windows 3.1x:
<PRE>  - 8 MB of RAM minimum (12 MB or more recommended)
  - 12 MB of hard-disk space (22 MB or more recommended)

</PRE>Macintosh:
<PRE>  - PowerPC processor
  - System 7.6.1 or later (Macintosh OS 8.0 is not supported)
  - 8 MB of RAM minimum to install Outlook (16 MB or more recommended to
    run Outlook and Outlook Calendar)
