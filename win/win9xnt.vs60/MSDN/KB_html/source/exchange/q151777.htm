The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
You can move existing Microsoft Exchange installations into new Windows NT
domains if the Microsoft Exchange Service Account is created in advance and
permissions are granted at the Organization, Site, Configuration, and
Schema containers.
<P>
Microsoft does not recommend that you change the domain that the Microsoft
Exchange Server is located in because it requires changing the Microsoft
Exchange Service Account. However, the procedure below can be used in a
situation where there is a single Microsoft Exchange Site and a single
Microsoft Exchange Server. In situations where there is more than one
Microsoft Exchange Server or Site, you will have to perform a complete
reinstallation of Microsoft Exchange.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Use the following steps to move an existing Microsoft Exchange
Server to a new domain:

<OL><P><LI>Make a full backup of the DSADATA subdirectory.

<P><LI>Create a trust with the new domain.

<P><LI>Create a Microsoft Exchange Service Account in the new domain with
    the same user name and password as in the previous domain. Grant
    this account Logon as a Service, Backup and Restore, and Act as 
    Part of the Operating System rights.

<P><LI>Start the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program in raw mode,
    Admin /r, and add the new Microsoft Exchange Service Account to the
    Organization, Site, and Configuration containers. Grant this
    account the Service Account Admin role.
<P>
 5  Add the new account to the Schema object by completing the following
    steps:
<P>
      a. View the Raw directory.
<P>
      b. Highlight the schema and choose Raw Properties from the File Menu.
<P>
      c. Edit the Windows NT security Descriptor Object Attribute and click
<PRE>         OK.

      d. Add the new account, click OK, and click Set.

</PRE><P><LI>Run the Services tool from the Control Panel and shut down the
    Microsoft Exchange System Attendant. Then assign ownership of each
    Microsoft Exchange Service to the new Microsoft Exchange Service
    Account.

<P><LI>Run the Network tool from the Control Panel and join the new
    domain.

<P><LI>Restart the computer.
<P>
 9 . Break the trust with the old domain.

<P><LI>Start the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program in raw mode again
    and remove the old account from the Organization, Site,
    Configuration, and Schema containers. Change the ownership of any
    local Microsoft Exchange mailboxes to the new domain user accounts.
