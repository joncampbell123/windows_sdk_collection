The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you try to open a Custom Recipient that has been loaded into
Microsoft Exchange by directory synchronization (dirsync) from
either Microsoft Mail 3.x or Microsoft Mail for Appletalk
Networks and it has non teletex characters ($, ~, ^, $, or #) in
the Common Name portion of the Distinguished Name, the following
error might be displayed:
<P>
<PRE>   The object cannot be found in the directory. This may be
   because replication has not completed.
   Microsoft Exchange Directory
   ID No. c1010aae

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Some dirsynced addresses contain non teletex characters in a
field that the Microsoft Exchange Directory Synchronization Agent
(DXA) uses for the alias field. This field is also used for the
Common Name portion of the Distinguished Name in the Microsoft
Exchange Directory. The Microsoft Exchange Administrator program
uses character mapping (ANSI) to handle the characters, but the
DXA converts these characters differently. The end result is that
the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program cannot open these
entries.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
The DXA has been changed to use the same method of character
conversion as the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange
Server U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack,
