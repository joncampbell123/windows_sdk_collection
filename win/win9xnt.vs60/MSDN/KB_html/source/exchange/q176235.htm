The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0
</UL> 
 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When Microsoft Exchange Server receives X.400-messages from another X.400
system that uses the ISO 8859-5 (Latin-5) character set for the message
bodypart, Microsoft Exchange cannot render the Cyrillic
characters correctly.
<P>
The characters in question are part of ISO 8859-5 (Latin-5) character set.
Instead, Microsoft Exchange replaces the Cyrillic characters with
placeholders. The replacement depends on the body-part chosen through the
Microsoft Exchange Administrator program. Because the ISO 8859-5 (Latin-5)
character set is not available, the chosen character set is different from
the original Latin-5 character set. Additionally, the lack of ISO 8859-5
(Latin-5) within Microsoft Exchange means that it was not possible to send
messages with Cyrillic characters to foreign X.400 systems that have been
set up to use ISO 8859-5 (Latin-5).
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The use of ISO 8859-5 (Latin-5) as X.400 bodypart for the X.400 message
text is not implemented in Microsoft Exchange.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft recognizes the increasing need to support the Latin-5 character
set properly.
This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on obtaining the
Service Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base (without the spaces):

<PRE>   S E R V P A C K

</PRE><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Aside of the hotfix described in this article, no workaround is available
for Cyrillic characters if the communication takes place between Microsoft
Exchange and foreign X.400 systems. If the communication takes place
between different Microsoft Exchange Servers, the option Allow MS Exchange
Contents can be used to prevent the conversion of messages from the
internal content (MDBEF) to the X.400-format.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Currently, in the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program on the X.400
Connector's Advanced property page, the drop down list X.400 Bodypart
Used for Message Text does not expose the added character set. Therefore,
the new functionality can only be activated using the Raw Properties of
the affected X.400-connector. To be able to access the Raw properties
of an Microsoft Exchange object you need to start the Microsoft Exchange
Administrator program in Raw mode. This is accomplished by typing:
<P>
<PRE>   &lt;drive:&gt;\&lt;path to the admin module&gt;\admin -r

</PRE>-or-
<P>
<PRE>   &lt;drive:&gt;\&lt;path to the admin module&gt;\admin /r

</PRE>on the command line.
<P>
Once the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program is started in Raw mode,
you can access the Raw properties of each object by highlighting the object
and clicking Raw Properties on the File menu. The name of the Raw attribute
which needs to be changed in this case is Translation-Table-Used and the
appropriate value is 8.
<P>
Because the fix does not affect Subject-Lines and Display-Names, it is
likely that in these lines Cyrillic characters will still be displayed as
"???".
