<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Exchange Server stores its data in Jet databases. To commit this
data to the database, Microsoft Exchange writes each transaction to a
transaction log. In the background, these transaction logs are committed to
the database. Microsoft Exchange Server has a circular logging option that,
when enabled, limits the amount of disk space used by these transaction
logs. This article describes the ways in which circular logging affects the
use of transaction logs in Microsoft Exchange.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Transaction Logs and How Microsoft Exchange Uses Them</h3>
 
<P>
Transaction logs are files that Microsoft Exchange uses to commit data (e-
mail messages, user additions, creation of folders, and so forth) to the
corresponding database file on disk. For example in the \Exchsrvr\Mdbdata
directory you may see files such as Edb.log, Edb00001.log, Priv.edb, and
Pub.edb. The Edb*.log files are the transaction logs and the *.edb files
are the information store database files. (Priv.edb is the private
information store and Pub.edb is the public information store.) The most
current transactions are stored in Edb.log; when Edb.log reaches 5 MB in
size, a file called Edbtmp.log is created to accept incoming transactions
and Edb.log in renamed to Edb00001.log. After Edb.log is renamed,
Edbtmp.log is then renamed Edb.log. This process is repeated each time
Edb.log reaches 5 MB in size. Thus, the log files build up as more and more
transactions are created.
<P>
Microsoft Exchange Server uses these write-ahead transaction logs to ensure
up-to-the-second recoverability of the database. Each (operation)
transaction is written to a transaction file and to the database cache, and
eventually to the database. After data is written to the database, a
checkpoint (Edb.chk) is advanced. This checkpoint marks the position in the
log files at which the database is in a consistent state. Thus, within the
set of transaction logs there is a portion that can be considered active
and a portion that can be considered inactive. If an event such as a power
outage causes the system to fail, Microsoft Exchange goes into automatic
recovery when the system is restarted. This entails rolling forward through
the transactions in the existing log files to the checkpoint.
<P>
As described earlier, during recovery, the inactive portion of each log is
not used; however, the logs can prove to be valuable when media failures
occur. If the transaction logs are hosted on a different medium than the
database and the medium containing the database fails, it is possible to
generate a complete recovery by restoring the last full backup on the new
medium and then roll forward through all the log files. Essentially, the
checkpoint gets moved back from its location relative to the database on
the disk that failed. Media failure is not a common scenario, but this is
the only way (other than a fault tolerant solution, such as mirroring) that
Microsoft Exchange can recover from media failures.
<P>
<P>
When circular logging is disabled, the system will continue to create log
files until a backup is completed. Backing up Microsoft Exchange Server is
the preferred way of saving the log files and removing these logs from the
disk to free up space.
<P>
For additional information on freeing up disk space, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : Reclaiming Disk Space for the Information Store

</PRE><h3>Effect of Having Circular Logging Turned On (Setup Default)</h3>
 
<P>
When circular logging is on, Microsoft Exchange writes transaction logs as
usual; however, after the checkpoint (Edb.chk) file has been advanced, the
inactive portion of the transaction log is discarded and overwritten.
Typically, this represents the majority of the potential log data, because
by definition, the total size of the active transactions will be less than
the total amount of RAM on a given computer. Thus, when circular logging is
on, the system still has complete recoverability with respect to hard and
soft failures. The element that is sacrificed is the extra protection
against media failure. Also, because the transaction logs are used for
incremental and differential backups, these backup methods are no longer
valid. If you try to do an incremental or a differential backup on a server
that has circular logging enabled, Microsoft Windows NT Backup will
generate an error informing the user that it cannot be done.
<P>
When circular logging enabled you can see more than one transaction log in
the log directory. For example, if a user sends a message with a 25 MB
attachment it is likely, because the maximum log file size is 5 MB, to see
four logs created to process this transaction in addition to Edb.log. That
is, you will see Edb00001.log, Edb00002.log, Edb00003.log, and
Edb00004.log. After the transaction is processed completely, these log
files will remain until a full backup is performed on the database, at
which time they will be removed. If the number of log files generated with
circular logging enabled is equal to or greater than four (not including
Edb.log) the logs will stay until a full backup is performed.
<P>
When circular logging is enabled, high volume conditions also cause the
number of log files to increase. Because the inactive portion of a
transaction log is only discarded and reused after the Edb.chk has moved
past it, many transactions may build up in the logs before they can be
processed. If the total number of unprocessed transactions exceeds 5 MB and
more continue to build up, another log file (for example, Edb00001.log)
will be created to hold these transactions. If the high volume conditions
continue, the log files will continue to grow in number until the
transactions can be processed completely. After the transaction processing
catches up and the Edb.chk is advanced past the transactions in these log
files, they will become inactive and again will not be removed until a full
backup is performed. Other possible causes of log files growing with
circular logging enabled are faulty SCSI controllers or hard drives that
cause the transactions not to be completed in a timely manner and the
Edb.log files being held open exclusively by another process other then Jet
(for example, backup programs, copying operations, and so forth).
