<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Field Help... dialog box in Microsoft Exchange Electronic Forms
Designer (EFD) does not list the fields that have been added to the canvas
in alphabetical order. Instead, the fields are listed in the order in which
they were added to the canvas. This behavior is not as expected and may
make it difficult to find the desired field in the list.
<P>
The field on the canvas that has the focus when the Field Help... dialog is
triggered is the default field that shows up in the Field listbox.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Field Help... dialog is accessed by double-clicking on one of the
objects that has been added to the canvas and then clicking on the Field
Help... button. This feature is used only at design time and will not
affect the end users of the forms.
<P>
This issue should not drastically affect the designer of the form unless he
has added many objects to the canvas. In this case, it may be most
efficient to double-click on each object separately and go into that
object's Field Help, by default, and add the help information.
