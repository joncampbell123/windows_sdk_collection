<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you perform an inbound or outbound push from the Network News Transfer
Protocol (NNTP) server to another server, some articles may crash the
store during the inbound newsfeed. You may receive the following event log
error:
<P>
<PRE>   An unexpected response (500) was received from news server
   ninou.dns.microsoft.com.

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service
Pack for Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on
obtaining the service pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base (without the spaces):
<P>
<PRE>   S E R V P A C K

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The ending sequence parsing code in NNTP will get confused if the following
occurs:

<UL><LI>A post (or Ihave newsfeed) comes into a newsgroup that the poster does
   not have access to.
<LI>The post is greater than 1K in size.
<LI>The character at offset 1k in the posted article is 0xA.
<LI>The last 3 characters (before the real ending sequence) of the article
   are ". 0xD 0xA" ("." 0x0d 0x0a).
<LI>The article is rejected.
<P>
</UL>Microsoft Exchange Server prematurely decides to terminate the post and
therefore corrupts the data stream between the client and server. This can
also happen with messages larger than the maximum message size. NNTP is
treating the last 5 bytes of an article as commands, and as a result sends
back the following error message to the client:
<P>
<PRE>   500 command not recognized
