<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When running the Microsoft Exchange Server Setup program to join an
existing Microsoft Exchange Site, the Setup process may fail. This article
explains some troubleshooting steps when the two servers are communicating
using the TCP/IP network protocol.
<P>
The following is a common error message during the replication phase of the
Setup process:
<P>
<PRE>   A connection could not be made to the remote directory service, possibly
   due to a network failure. Be sure both directory services are running
   and that your network is available and running and then try again.

   Microsoft Exchange Setup Error: c1030b11

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
During the replication phase of the Setup program, the protocols listed in
the Server Binding Order are used to locate the existing Microsoft Exchange
Server and complete replication.
<P>
By default, TCP/IP is the first protocol in the Server Binding Order.
<P>
TCP/IP resolves names in the following order:
<P>
<PRE>   1. Using the local HOSTS file
   2. Using a DNS Server
   3. Looking at the NetBIOS Cache
   4. Using a WINS Server
   5. Broadcasting
   6. Looking at the local LMHOSTS file

</PRE>The following instructions assume that you are running the Microsoft
Exchange Setup program on Server A, trying to contact the computer running
Microsoft Exchange Server, Server B.
<P>
To determine whether you are experiencing problems resolving the name of
the computer running Microsoft Exchange Server:

<OL><P><LI>From Server A, ping Server B (use the server name and not an IP
   address).
<P>
   If the ping succeeds, note the IP address returned back and compare it
   to the actual IP address of Server B. This is important because you may
   have incorrect entries in the HOSTS/LMHOSTS file or a DNS may have
   incorrect information.
<P>
   If the Ping fails, you need to make sure that one of the above name
   resolution methods is capable of resolving the server name. The easiest
   way to get the installation complete would be to add entries for the
   other server in the local HOSTS file, on Server A and Server B.

<P><LI>If the ping succeeds, then from Server B, ping Server A. If the ping
   succeeds, compare the IP address returned by the Ping program with the
   actual IP address of Server A. If this is not the same, it can cause the
   Microsoft Exchange Server Setup program to fail during the replication
   phase with the above error message.
<P>
</OL>If the name resolution seems to be working fine, but you are still
experiencing problems joining a site:

<OL><P><LI>Verify that you are logged on to Windows NT on Server A as a Domain
   Administrator.

<P><LI>Verify that the account logged on to Server A has the Permissions Admin
   privilege on the Organization, Site, and Configuration containers on the
   existing Exchange site. To do this, run Microsoft Exchange Administrator
   program against Server B and check the properties of the Organization,
   Site, and Configuration containers.

<P><LI>Use the Rpingc32.exe and Rpings.exe programs to verify remote call
   procedure (RPC) connectivity between Server A and Server B.

<P><LI>If RPING fails, use the Windows NT utility, Tracert.exe, to determine
   all the routers between Server A and Server B. Some routers may be
   configured to block access to certain ports. This will prevent access to
   the Microsoft Exchange directory on Server B.
<P>
   If you have routers configured to block access to ports above a certain
   number, you need to configure the Directory and Information Store on
   Server B to use predefined Ports and then configure the routers to allow
   access to these ports.

<P><LI>Determine the network topology between the two servers in question. The
   communication between two FDDI rings through an Ethernet segment may
   fail when you use TCP/IP and any FDDI network interface card (NIC).
   This can be resolved by setting the MTU size on the Windows NT Server's
   to the Ethernet segment's MTU size.
<P>
   This situation can be detected by looking at a network trace of the
   communication between the two servers. If any server is sending out
   packets larger than the Ethernet segment's MTU size, communication
   between the two servers will fail.
