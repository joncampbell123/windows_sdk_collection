The Information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Exchange Server, a public folder can be configured to have
replicas on multiple public folder servers. The process of keeping public
folders up to date is called public folder replication. In Microsoft
Exchange, a replication schedule must be set up to determine how often
changes are replicated to other Servers and Sites.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Replication Schedule property page determines when changes to the
public folder are distributed to other Servers. To set up a schedule,
select Detail view, and choose Use Information Store Schedule, Never,
Always, or Selected Times options. These options are described below:

<UL><LI>Detail View: Select 1 hour to view the schedule grid in one-hour
<PRE>                increments.

</PRE><LI>Use Information: Uses the schedule set in the Public Information Store
<PRE>                    Replication Store Schedule property page as the
                    schedule for replicating this public folder.

</PRE><LI>Never: Disables public folder replication for this folder.

<LI>Always: Runs replication every 15 minutes.

<LI>Selected times: Assigns specific replication times in the schedule grid.
<P>
</UL>NOTE: There is no option to "Replicate Now" for public folders. Replication
only occurs during scheduled instances as described above.
