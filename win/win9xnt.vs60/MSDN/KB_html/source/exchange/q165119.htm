<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article will explain the basics of configuring a Microsoft Exchange
Site Connector.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Administrative Account: This account is the user who was logged in during
the installation of Microsoft Exchange Server. This user will receive
Permissions Admin for the Organization, Site, and Configuration objects.
These are the three parent objects and the permission will be propagated to
all child objects.
<P>
Service Account: This should be a Domain User account made prior to
installation of the Microsoft Exchange Server. This account will receive a
Custom role on the Organization object and Service Account Admin on the
Site and Configuration Objects. This account will be granted rights to Log
On as a Service and Restore Files and Directories. This account can be
changed on a single Server Site, but requires modifying the Microsoft
Exchange Schema and NT Registry permissions.
<P>
Environment: The Windows NT pagefile on Intel based servers should have an
Initial setting equal to physical memory plus 111 megabytes and a Maximum
equal to 211 megabytes plus physical memory. RISC based servers should have
an Initial pagefile equal to 61 megabytes greater than physical memory and
a Maximum pagefile equal to 111 megabytes plus physical memory.
<P>
Memory: Run the Microsoft Exchange Optimizer and configure the Microsoft
Exchange Server as is appropriate for the server. Limit the amount of
memory that Microsoft Exchange Server may use. This reserves memory for the
operating system and has been shown to eliminate erratic behavior in the
MTA. The following are guidelines for Microsoft Exchange memory use.
Determine total physical memory installed on the server. Multiply this
number by .75. Select the Memory Usage check box and enter the result of the
previous calculation. The rule of thumb is use 75 percent of total physical
memory for Microsoft Exchange. This reserves 25 percent of real memory for
Windows NT.
<P>
Connector configuration methodology is dependent on the NT Domain model(s)
involved and the type of server on which Microsoft Exchange is installed.
Confirm the type of server on which Microsoft Exchange is installed, it is
important to know if the server is Domain Controller or a Member Server.
Microsoft Exchange Server requires that at least one server be a domain
controller for domain validation.
<P>
If the servers are in the same domain, It is preferable to use the same
service account. However, this is not a requirement. Selecting different
service accounts will require use of the override properties on any Site
connector between Sites with different service accounts.
<P>
As a minimum, assign Admin Permissions for the Site and Configuration
Objects to the User or Group that will be configuring a Site connector. If
the Sites use different service accounts, enter the service account for the
other Site on the Override tab of the Site connector.
