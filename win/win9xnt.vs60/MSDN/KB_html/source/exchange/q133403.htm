The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
When you use the Microsoft Exchange Server message transfer agent (MTA),
the following nondelivery report message (NDR) is delivered to the sender
when no address space exists for at least the address type or the address
routing information on at least one of the Microsoft Exchange connectors:
<P>
<PRE>   Your message did not reach some or all of the intended recipients.

      Subject:  &lt;Message Subject&gt;
      Sent:     &lt;Date&gt; &lt;Time&gt;

   The following recipient(s) could not be reached:

      '&lt;Recipient's Address&gt;' on 5/26/95 11:45:38AM
      The recipient name is not recognized


</PRE>This message does not necessarily indicate that the recipient is invalid,
but rather that the MTA does not recognize the address type as a
deliverable type. Make sure the recipient address type is valid. You should
verify that the address spaces for the required connector contain at least
the type of address (X.400, SMTP, SNADS, MS, and so forth). This is done
through the Address Space property tab of the connector responsible for
routing the mail to the recipient.
<P>
The current gateway address routing table, the GWART0.MTA file located in
the Exchsrvr\MTAData directory, can also be viewed with a text editor to
ensure that the type of address being used is known by the MTA service. If
not, the message will be rejected.
<P>
WARNING: Although you can view GWART0.MTA with a text editor, it should 
never be modified with one. Doing so may result in the MTA and/or 
Connectors not working properly. To update GWART0.MTA, open the Site 
Addressing Object located under the Site Configuration object, click on 
the Routing tab, then press the Recalculate Routing button. 
<P>
For more information on message routing and address spaces, consult the
Microsoft Exchange Server "Administrator's Guide."
