<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Macintosh client, versions 4.0 and 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Apple's Open Transport 1.1.2 contains a version of MacPPP for the
Macintosh. MacPPP can be used to dial into a Windows NT Server computer
running Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) and gain connectivity to a Microsoft
Exchange Server computer.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Currently, there is no remote solution included with the Exchange Macintosh
client. Although the client does support Offline Folders and offline mode,
it does not contain any type of dial-up networking components. The
Macintosh operating system also has no built-in dial-up networking
solution.
<P>
MacPPP allows you to create a dial-up networking connection for the
Macintosh using TCP/IP that is compatible with Windows NT RAS Server. A
Macintosh with Open Transport 1.1.2 and MacPPP installed can call a Windows
NT RAS Server, get validated and use the Exchange Macintosh client across
the dial-up connection.
<P>
Below are some general tips to help you use this software successfully.
Complete instructions for obtaining, installing and using MacPPP and the
Exchange Macintosh client are also included.
<P>
<P><h3>Tips</h3>
 

<UL><LI>The client can ONLY be run in continuous (online) mode or use the
   Synchronization feature ONLY after a dial-up connection has been made.
   The dial-up connection must be made prior to starting the Exchange
   Macintosh client, and the client will NOT auto-dial the connection.

<LI>There are individual files available for download if the single net
   install file is too large, four files named OT_1.1.2-1OFx.SEA.HQX (x=1
   of 4, 800 KB each). Both the complete Open Transport installation and
   the Open Transport Extras are required.

<LI>The steps for configuring Open transport assume that the Macintosh has
   both a LAN network adapter and a modem for dial-up networking. If you
   don't want to configure a LAN adapter, then proceed with steps 1 through
   6 only and use your dial-up networking TCP/IP settings for the default
   configuration.

<LI>Although there are many other options in the Config PPP Control Panel,
   the steps for Configuring MacPPP should be the minimum configuration for
   connection to a Windows NT RAS Server.

<LI>Be sure that you switch the dial-up networking configuration you want
   BEFORE trying to dial your PPP server. Making this switch does not
   prompt to restart the Macintosh, although you may have to sometimes to
   help clear problems.

<LI>During connections you may get an error message similar to the
   following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Message from server: E=268
</PRE><P>
   When you are connecting to a Windows NT RAS server and you get these
   error messages, refer to the Windows NT RAS Help file for an explanation
   of the number.

<LI>Use a utility like MacPING (available on the World Wide Web) to ping the
   Exchange Server name. It is important that you get a reply from the
   server's IP address. If you cannot ping the server name, try pinging the
   IP address of the server. If you can ping the address but not the name,
   create a local HOSTS file that contains the IP addresses of the Exchange
   Server computer and the primary domain controller (PDC)(if they are
   different computers).
<P>
   For additional information, please see the following article in the
   Microsoft Knowledge Base:

<PRE></PRE>      TITLE     : XCLN: Configuring Mac Client for TCP/IP

</PRE><LI>You can also test profile and connection without having to start the
   client. Open the Exchange Settings application and click the Check Names
   button on the Exchange Server service properties, General tab. You
   should be prompted for your domain credentials enter them and see if the
   Exchange Server and user name get underlined. If this works, the client
   should start without problems.
<P>
</UL><h3>Installing Open Transport 1.1.2</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Obtain Open Transport 1.1.2 from:
<P>
<P><PRE>      FTP.APPLE.COM/APPLE.SUPPORT.AREA/
      APPLE.SOFTWARE.UPDATES/US/MACINTOSH/ NETWORKING-COMMUNICATIONS/
      OPEN_TRANSPORT
</PRE><P>
</OL>or do a Web site search from WWW.APPLE.COM.

<OL><P><LI>Download the files OT_1.1.2-NET_INSTALL.SEA.HQX (9 MB) as well as
   OT_1.1.2-EXTRAS.SEA.HQX (6 MB). See the second item in the list of tips
   above.

<P><LI>Using a BinHex converter (available on the WWW), extract the contents of
   the downloaded files onto the desktop. This should create two folders,
   Net Install and Open Transport Extras.

<P><LI>Review the included README document.

<P><LI>Open the Net Install folder. It should contain four Install sub-folders,
   several ReadMe files and an Installer. Start the Installer to install
   Open Transport 1.1.2 on the Macintosh. Restart the Macintosh.

<P><LI>Open the Open Transport Extra's folder and the MacPPP sub-folder. Copy
   the PPP System Extension and Config PPP Control Panel to the System
   Folder. They will automatically be placed in the correct sub-folders.
   Restart the Macintosh.
<P>
</OL><h3>Configuring Open Transport 1.1.2</h3>
 
<P>
See the third item in the list of tips above.

<OL><P><LI>On the Apple menu, select Control Panels and TCP/IP.

<P><LI>Choose your network adapter in the Connect Via box (that is, Ethernet
   Built-In, Ethernet Slot 1 or MacPPP). This is the adapter that you're
   creating a configuration for TCP/IP to use.

<P><LI>Enter the TCP/IP settings according to the network you're using.
   If more options are needed, select the Edit menu and User Mode and
   set the User Mode to Advanced, click OK.  This provides this TCP/IP
   configuration with more options. The ability for the Exchange client
   to resolve the name of the Exchange Server computer depends on these
   settings being correct.

<P><LI>Click the Options button, ensure Active is selected and the Load
   Only When Needed check box is cleared. Also, click Select Hosts
   File if necessary. Please see Microsoft Knowledge Base article <B><A href="../exchange/q149596.htm">Q149596</A></B>
   (referenced above) for a sample hosts file.

<P><LI>Close the TCP/IP Control Panel. You will be prompted to Save Changes to
   the Current Configuration; click Save. This will save this configuration
   as the Default TCP/IP configuration.
<P>
   This should allow use of TCP/IP over the specified adapter with
   the settings provided.
<P>
</OL>NOTE : Only proceed with the following if you want two TCP/IP
configurations (one for a LAN and another for dial-up networking).

<OL><P><LI>On the Apple menu, select Control Panels and TCP/IP.

<P><LI>On the File menu , select Configurations. Select the Default
   configuration and select Duplicate. Call the new configuration something
   unique to dial-up networking (that is, MacPPP). Select the new
   configuration and click Make Active, now click Close.

<P><LI>In the Connect Via box, select MacPPP. Type the TCP/IP settings
   according to the network you will be dialing. If more options are
   needed, select the Edit menu and User Mode and set the User Mode to
   Advanced, and then click OK. This provides this TCP/IP configuration
   with more options. The ability for the Exchange client to resolve the
   name of the Exchange Server computer depends on these settings being
   correct.

<P><LI>Close the TCP/IP Control Panel. You will be prompted to Save
   Changes to the Current Configuration; click Save. This will save
   this configuration as the TCP/IP configuration you specified above.

<P><LI>To change between LAN and dial-up networking, use the TCP/IP
   Control Panel and the Configurations menu. The configuration that is
   set to Active will be used for ALL TCP/IP applications.
<P>
</OL><h3>Configuring MacPPP</h3>
 
<P>
See the fourth item in the list of tips above.

<OL><P><LI>On the Apple menu, select Control Panels and Config PPP.

<P><LI>Click the New button to specify a new server. Type the name for
   this server. Click OK.

<P><LI>Click Config to set up this new server. Change the Port Speed to
   match your modem, select Tone or Pulse, and type the phone number of
   the server you are calling.

<P><LI>Click Authentication, type your Windows NT domain user name and Windows
   NT domain password. Click OK.

<P><LI>Click the Open button to establish a dial-up networking connection
   with the selected server. See the fifth and seventh items in the list
   of tips above.
<P>
</OL><h3>Using Exchange Macintosh Client and MacPPP</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create a new profile for your Exchange server mailbox. In the
   Exchange Server properties, select TCP/IP for the connection on the
   General tab.

<P><LI>Connect to the Exchange Server computer's network either via MacPPP
   dial-up or LAN connection (LAN is recommended if configuring Offline
   Folders).

<P><LI>Start the Exchange Macintosh client using this new profile to test the
   connection to the Exchange Server computer. You should be prompted for
   your Windows NT domain account information. Once the client is open,
   verify that mail is moving correctly by sending yourself a test message.
   See the eighth item in the list of tips above

<P><LI>If you want Offline Folders, on the Tools menu, select Services.
<P>
   Select the Exchange Server service and click Properties. Click
   the Advanced tab. Click the Offline Folders button and create a new
   Offline Folders file. Click OK and return to the Inbox.

<P><LI>While still in online mode, on the Tools menu, select Synchronize
   All Folders. The Offline Folders file is now ready.
<P>
</OL>To get a copy of the GAL to use while working offline, on the Tools menu,
click Synchronize and click Download Address Book. This will give you a
copy of the GAL to be used while working offline.
<P>
The client can now be started using this profile in offline mode. You can
read and compose mail, and view and post to public folders in the Favorites
folder. Any changes made offline will be delayed until the next
synchronization with the Exchange Server computer.
<P>
<P><h3>Suggestions</h3>
 

<UL><LI>Always use the simplest settings first, for the server as well as
   the client. Use clear text authentication and don't use callbacks on
   the RAS server.

<LI>Create different Exchange profiles for working directly connected
   via the LAN and using MacPPP.

<LI>Test the connection by pinging sever names and getting replies from
   their IP addresses. The Exchange client will need to communicate with
   the PDC as well as the Exchange Server computer (if they are different
   computers).

<LI>Ensure the Exchange account can be accessed from a LAN workstation.

<LI>Try using static IP addresses for dial-up clients instead of DHCP
   and create a local HOSTS file instead of using DNS for testing.

<LI>Try reducing the baud rate of the calling modem.
