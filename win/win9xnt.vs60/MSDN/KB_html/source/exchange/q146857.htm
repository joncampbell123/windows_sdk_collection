The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Windows 95 client, versions 4.0 and 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0 and 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0 and 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Exchange MS-DOS client, versions 4.0 and 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Shared folders are moved by copying and deleting the original folder.
Therefore, the original permissions of the shared folders are lost. In
addition, if a user with administrator privileges moves a folder that is
not owned by the user, the user becomes the owner of the folder.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft Exchange
version 4.0 clients. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The ability to move folders is a new functionality in Exchange. Therefore,
it is important to remember the following:

<UL><LI>Folder permissions are reset to the default Read and Write access
   when a folder is moved.

<LI>The ownership of a folder changes to the user who moved it.

<LI>Folders can only be moved or renamed by the Administrator or a user
   with administrator privileges.
