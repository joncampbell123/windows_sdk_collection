The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes the "Not Read" notification message generated
by a Microsoft Exchange Server.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
A Microsoft Exchange client user can request notification when a message is
read. The Exchange Server then sends the message originator a notification
message when the recipient reads the message.
<P>
The notification message has a subject line with the following format:
<P>
<PRE>   Read: &lt;Original Message Subject&gt;

</PRE>The message body of the notification message has the following format:
<P>
<PRE>   Your message

         To:       Test User
         Subject:  &lt;Original Message Subject&gt;
         Sent:     8/22/95 1:27:33 PM

   was read on 8/22/95 1:30:16 PM

</PRE>Occasionally, when an Exchange user sends a message with Read-Receipt
notification turned on, the notification message returned has a subject
line with following format:
<P>
<PRE>   Not Read: &lt;Original Message Subject&gt;

</PRE>The body of the message contains the following information:
<P>
<PRE>   Your message

      To:       Test User
      Subject:  Test of Read Notification
      Sent:     8/22/95 1:14:24PM

   has not yet been read. It has either been deleted or moved to a place
   where it can no longer be tracked. As a result, no further
   notifications will be sent.

</PRE>NOTE: The notification message will not be sent if the message is deleted
on the server until the deleted folder is emptied. The feature to empty the
deleted folder is set by default. To change the feature, select Options
from the Tools menu. Then, under the General tab, select the Empty the
<PRE>'Deleted Items' Folder Upon Exiting check box.

</PRE>The above notification message can be generated if the message has been
deleted before it was read or if the recipient has defined a rule in the
Inbox Assistant that moves the message into a folder located in a .PST file
on a local machine, before the message was read.
<P>
The Microsoft Exchange Information Store service is responsible for
tracking messages to generate the notification messages. The folders
in a user's local .PST file cannot be tracked by the information store
and hence the "Not Read" notification is generated.
