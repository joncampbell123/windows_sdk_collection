The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0
</UL>

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Exchange Message Transfer Agent (MTA) may attempt, over an
X.400 connector, to deliver a message that was sent to a Microsoft Exchange
mailbox that was recently removed from the system. The message will
eventually result in a non-delivery report (NDR) and the sender will
receive a message similar to the following:
<P>
<PRE>   Your message did not reach some or all of the intended recipients.

      Subject: This is a test
      Sent: 1/24/97 11:17:44 AM

   The following recipient(s) could not be reached:

      /c=US/a=ATTMAIL/p=Org/DDA:MSXCHNGE=
      //o=Org//ou=Site//cn=RECIPIENTS//cn=Mailbox

   on 1/24/97 11:16:59 AM

   The recipient was detected looping within the message transfer service.

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange version
4.0.
This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange 4.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):
<P>
<PRE>   S E R V P A C K

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This problem only happens under certain circumstances where a message has
been sent from a user in a site where the intended recipient was not
originally located. This could occur if someone attempts to reply to a
message sent by someone who was recently removed from the mail system.
Senders who reside in the same site where the intended recipient was
originally located will receive an NDR immediately with a message similar
to the following:
<P>
<PRE>   Your message did not reach some or all of the intended recipients.

   Subject: This is a test
   Sent: 1/24/97 11:17:44 AM

   The following recipient(s) could not be reached:

      'User Name' on 1/24/97 11:14:44 AM

   The recipient name is not recognized.

</PRE>To explain this behavior more clearly, assume there is an Exchange
organization called "Org" that consists of three sites, Site A, Site B, and
Site C. Both Site A and Site C are connected via site connectors to Site B
which is the hub for the organization. Site B connects the organization to
the rest of the world via an X400 connector. There used to be a mailbox in
Site C for OldUserOnC. When a user in Site A attempts to reply to a message
that had been sent by OldUserOnC prior to that user being removed from the
system, the message is sent to the hub server in Site B. When the message
reached the hub server, there are two parts to the recipient's address.
These two parts are the DN (Distinguished Name) and OR
(Originator/Recipient) addresses.
<P>
The hub first tries to resolve the full DN which may have been similar to:
<P>
/O=Org/Ou=Site C/CN=Recipients/CN=OldUserOnC
<P>
The DN no longer exists in the DS since the user's mailbox had been
deleted. Thus, it then tries to resolve the OR address via a proxy lookup.
It does not find a new DN based on the OR address proxy lookup. It then
nulls out the original DN and then attempts to route the message out over
the X400 connector where it does not match anything, and ultimately NDRs.
