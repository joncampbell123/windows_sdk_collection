<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Windows 95 client, versions 4.0 and 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0 and 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0 and 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Exchange Macintosh client, versions 4.0 and 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The .pst and .pab files are not interchangeable between the Microsoft
Exchange Macintosh and Microsoft Exchange Windows clients.
<P>
This also applies the Schedule+ file types .sch and .sc2, as well as
Offline Folder .ost files and Advanced Security .epf files.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>For .PST Files</h3>
 
<P>
If you need to access Microsoft Exchange messages from both Macintosh and
Windows, save everything in your mailbox to the Microsoft Exchange server.
<P>
For example:

<OL><P><LI>Log on to a Microsoft Exchange account from a Windows client.

<P><LI>Create a folder on the computer running Microsoft Exchange Server.

<P><LI>Copy all locally saved message (the Windows .pst) to the folder on the
   server.

<P><LI>Log on to the same Microsoft Exchange account from a Macintosh computer.

<P><LI>Copy all locally saved messages from the server to a personal folder
   (the Macintosh .pst)
<P>
</OL><h3>For .PAB Files</h3>
 
<P>
If you want to add users from a Macintosh PAB to a Windows PAB, perform 
the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Log into the Macintosh Exchange Client, compose a message, and place
   users from the PAB on the TO: line.

<P><LI>Save the message by selecting Save from the File menu.

<P><LI>The composed message will remain in your Inbox.

<P><LI>Log into a Windows Exchange Client and open the saved message.

<P><LI>Right click on a  user on the To: line and select Add to Personal
   Address Book.
<P>
<P>
</OL><h3>For .SCH Files</h3>
 
<P>
If you need to access Microsoft Schedule+ information from both Macintosh
and Windows, keep all Schedule+ information in your server (shared)
schedule to the Microsoft Exchange server.  Do not use a local Schedule+
.sch file.
<P>
For example:

<OL><P><LI>Log on to a Microsoft Exchange account from a Windows client.

<P><LI>Start Schedule+ and click "I do not want a schedule file on this
   machine."

<P><LI>If the profile already existed and Schedule+ is already configured with
   a local file:
<P>
   a. On the Tools menu, click Options.
<P>
   b. On the Synchronize tab, clear the "Work Primarily From Local File"
   check box. Click OK.

<P><LI>Log on to the same Microsoft Exchange account from a Macintosh computer.

<P><LI>Start Schedule+ and either select to not have a schedule file on this
   computer
<P>
   -OR-
<P>
<P><PRE>    Disable the local schedule file as done in step 3.
</PRE><P>
</OL><h3>For .OST Files</h3>
 
<P>
Offline Folder files are simply a mirror image of what is in your server
mailbox. Re-createOffline folder files on the platform for which they are
intended to be used.
<P>
<P><h3>For .EPF Files</h3>
 
<P>
Issue Advanced Security files and save them locally for each platform for
which they are intended to be used.
