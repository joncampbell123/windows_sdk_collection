<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
WHOIS is a service provided by the InterNIC that provides information on
second-level domains including contact e-mail addresses, postal addresses
and telephone numbers of those who have registered with the InterNIC. WHOIS
can also help determine whether a domain name is already in use which can
be helpful for new site administrators.
<P>
WHOIS can be accessed through WHOIS clients, interactive telnet sessions, e-
mail, and the World Wide Web. The InterNIC database provides information
about COM, .EDU, .NET, .ORG, and .GOV domains.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This WHOIS service involves an online database that contains information
about networks, networking organizations, domains, sites, and the contacts
associated with them. This database is known as the InterNIC database.
<P>
The names of the administrative and technical contacts for registered
domains are entered into the database when domain or IP number applications
are processed by the InterNIC.
<P>
The information contained in the InterNIC database can be especially
valuable if there is a problem with internetworking between two domains.
For example, WHOIS can help determine who to contact if there is a problem
with Internet mail that cannot be resolved through e-mail. WHOIS can show
the Exchange Server administrator the name and phone number of the
administrator at a destination host.
<P>
ACCESSING WHOIS:
<P>
WHOIS Client:
<P>
The WHOIS client program accesses the InterNIC database directly and is
usually included with UNIX systems. There are also clients available for
other platforms including Windows and Windows NT.
<P>
If you have shell account access to the Internet that includes the WHOIS
client, type the following:
<P>
<PRE>   whois domain.com

</PRE>Where "domain.com" is the name of the Internet domain of the host that you
are interested in. Note that the InterNIC registers secondary domain names
only. For best results DO NOT include Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) on
the query. FQDNs include the higher level domains associated with an
Internet site. Only secondary domain names will return contact information.
<P>
Example:
<P>
<PRE>Wrong:   www.microsoft.com
</PRE>Correct: microsoft.com
<P>
Direct Telnet Session:
<P>
All systems that have access to the Internet should have the ability to use
a standard telnet client to connect to the InterNIC to run the WHOIS client
from their system. Networks that restrict access to the Internet through
use of a firewall will not be able to use this method if tcp port 23
(standard telnet port) access is blocked.
<P>
Exchange Server administrators may run the Windows NT Telnet client from
the computer that is running the IMC. Any telnet client from any host
connected to the Internet should work.
<P>
In telnet, connect to "internic.net". Once connected you may run WHOIS
commands as listed in the client instructions above.
<P>
World Wide Web:
<P>
The Web Interface to WHOIS is a searchable database through a web page. To
access with any World Wide Web (WWW) client, connect to:
<P>
<PRE>   <B>http://rs.internic.net/cgi-bin/whois</B>

</PRE>Electronic Mail:
<P>
If you are unable to access the methods above but have access to Internet
mail, you can send your query to:
<P>
<PRE>   mailserv@internic.net

</PRE>Enter your command in the subject line or as the first line of the body of
the message. All other text is ignored. You must prefix your command with
the word "WHOIS" just like the client examples above. Requests through
electronic mail are processed automatically once per day.
<P>
OTHER TOP LEVEL DOMAINS:
<P>
The InterNIC provides registration information for COM, .EDU, .NET, .ORG,
and .GOV domains only. However, the WHOIS client works with other top level
domains. Top level domains that do not provide compatibility with WHOIS may
provide other tools to research domains.
<P>
