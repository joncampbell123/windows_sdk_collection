<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In order to connect a host to the Internet, you must register a domain name
with the InterNIC. The InterNIC is responsible for registering top second
level domains EDU, ORG, GOV, COM, and NET. This article outlines procedures
and considerations for the registration process.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
InterNIC Registrations Services is provided by Network Solutions Inc. After
choosing potential domain names, you can use the WHOIS program to verify
that the domain is available. To use WHOIS, connect to
<B><A href="http://www.internic.net/">http://www.internic.net/</A></B> through a World Wide Web browser. For additional
information about methods of verifying domain names, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../exchange/q151710.htm">Q151710</A></B>
   TITLE     : Using WHOIS To Research Internet Domains

</PRE>After a domain name is selected, it should be entered into at least two
domain name servers. The first two servers are known as the primary DNS and
secondary DNS servers and are the authoritative servers for resolving hosts
for the domain. Other hosts that wish to connect with the domain will query
these servers to resolve a host name to an IP address. Any additional
servers that contain domain information will act as backups. While the
InterNIC requires existing domain servers to list the new domain before it
becomes propagated to the Internet, it is possible to reserve a domain name
first.
<P>
After the DNS entries are performed, an application is submitted to the
InterNIC along with payment for the registration. Currently, new
registrations are $100 for two years and renewals are $50 per year. Check
with the InterNIC for current pricing.
<P>
The easiest way to submit a registration application is through the World
Wide Web using the InterNIC home page listed above. The following
information is requested on the application:
<P>
<PRE>   1. Requested domain name.
   2. Contact Names. These include administrative, technical, zone, and
      billing contacts.
   3. Organization Details including name, address, and phone number.
   4. Primary and secondary DNS server names and host addresses.

</PRE>After you submit the application, the registration system will assign a
tracking and invoice number. The status of the registration can be tracked
via e-mail or the World Wide Web. Once the registration is complete, the
domain name will be propagated to top level name servers and Internet hosts
will be able to connect to machines on the new domain.
