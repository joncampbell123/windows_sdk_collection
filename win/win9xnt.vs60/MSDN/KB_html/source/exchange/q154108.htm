The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Dead Letter functionality is not included with Exchange server 4.0. This
existed on the release candidate builds but it was removed from the final
product. A server that has been upgraded through the release builds can
exhibit some problems when sending mail to invalid addresses. For example,
when sending a message to an invalid MS Mail address chosen from the
personal address book, the message may be sent to the Administrator's
Mailbox defined in the MS Mail Connector Properties. The sender does not
receive a Non-Delivery Report indicating address unknown. The recipient
does not receive the message.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This occurs if the Exchange Server has been upgraded from Release Candidate
1 to Release Candidate 2 to Exchange 4.0. In Release Candidate 1, an Object
Attribute called DOMAIN-DEF-ALT-RECIP was used to define a Dead Letter
recipient. This attribute was deleted  from Release Candidate 2;
however, the upgrading process may not have deleted this attribute.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 

<OL><P><LI>Launch the Exchange Administrator in raw mode by adding a forward slash
   and an r (/r) to the end of the command line.

<P><LI>Highlight the Configuration Object and select MTA Site Configuration.

<P><LI>On the File menu, select Raw Properties.

<P><LI>Locate the attribute DOMAIN-DEF-ALT-RECIP and delete the entry in the
   Edit Value field.

<P><LI>Press the Set button and click OK to exit the Raw Properties.

<P><LI>Using the Services tool in Control Panel, stop and restart the Microsoft
   Exchange Message Transfer Agent service.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Dead Letter recipient functionality provided a recipient for messages
that could not be delivered to the intended recipient. This functionality
was deleted in the Release Candidate 2.
