<P><h3>Windows CE - The Newest Member of the Windows Family</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft Windows CE is an open, scaleable Windows operating system
platform for a broad range of communications, entertainment and mobile-
computing devices. The standards-based Windows CE platform will make
possible new categories of non-PC business and consumer devices that can
communicate with each other, share information with Windows-based PCs, and
connect to the Internet. The first products based on Windows CE, a new
category of mobile companion devices for Windows-based PCs called handheld
PCs, or H/PCs, are anticipated to begin shipping before the end of the
year from leading personal computer and consumer electronics OEMs.
<P>
Formerly known by the code name "Pegasus," Windows CE is an entirely new
compact and portable operating system built from the ground up to be
appropriate for a broad range of business and consumer devices. Categories
of devices that Windows CE would be suitable for include small form-factor
mobile-computing devices such as the new handheld PCs, "wallet" PCs,
wireless-communication devices such as digital information pagers and
cellular smart phones, next-generation entertainment and multimedia
consoles including DVD players, and purpose-built Internet access devices
such as Internet TVs, digital set-top boxes and Internet "Web phones."
<P>
Windows CE extends Microsoft's vision of "Information at Your Fingertips"
beyond the PC to a variety of computer-based devices for customers whether
they are at home, in the office, at school or on the road. Windows CE
makes possible new categories of products that can 'talk' to each other,
share and exchange information with Windows-based PCs, and provide access
to the Internet for e-mail connections or to browse the World Wide Web.
<P>
Windows CE is the cornerstone of a complete, standards-based operating
environment designed to significantly lower the barriers for OEMs, hard-
ware manufacturers and software developers to create Windows-based
communications, entertainment and mobile-computing devices. The complete
Windows CE environment includes the following:

<UL><LI>The Windows CE operating system.
<P>
   The Windows CE operating system is a 32-bit, multitasking, multi-
   threaded operating system that has an open architecture design,
   providing support for a variety of devices. Windows CE is compact,
   providing high performance in limited memory configurations and is
   scaleable, supporting a range of embedded, mobile or multimedia product
   lines. Windows CE also has the advantage of being portable, providing
   choice in microprocessors and has integrated power management, enabling
   long battery life on mobile devices. Standard communications support is
   built into Windows CE, enabling access to the Internet to send and
   receive e-mail or browse the World Wide Web. In addition, a graphical
   user interface, incorporating many elements of the familiar Windows
   user interface, will be available on certain devices, facilitating ease
   of use for end users.

<LI>Built-in hardware, multimedia and communications support.
<P>
   Support for hardware, multimedia and communications standards means
   that a broad range of Windows CE-based mobile companion, information
   access, and entertainment devices can be created that communicate with
   each other, integrate with Windows-based personal computers, and access
   the Internet.

<LI>Companion applications.
<P>
   The Windows CE operating system supports Windows CE-based companion
   applications that share or synchronize information with their
   counterparts for Windows.

<LI>Microsoft Internet Explorer.
<P>
   Windows CE includes a version of Microsoft Internet Explorer, offering
   built-in Web access for new and existing categories of communications,
   entertainment and mobile-computing devices.

<LI>Familiar Windows development environment.
<P>
   The Windows CE development environment supports a comprehensive,
   expandable subset of Win32 APIs and uses familiar off-the-shelf tools,
   building on the experience of thousands of developers and ensuring that
   a strong aftermarket for applications for Windows CE will emerge.

<LI>Synergy with Windows-based PCs.
<P>
   Windows CE will be able to seamlessly synchronize, communicate and
   exchange information with Windows-based PCs.
<P>
</UL><h3>The Handheld PC - The First Windows CE-based Device</h3>
 
<P>
Over 40 leading hardware and software companies have committed to
developing products for a new category of mobile companion devices for
Microsoft Windows-based PCs called handheld PCs, or H/PCs, based on
Microsoft's new Windows CE platform.
<P>
The following computer and consumer electronics companies have announced
their commitment to develop and manufacture H/PCs: Casio Computer Co.,
Hewlett-Packard Co., LG Electronics, NEC Corp., and Philips Electronics.
Microsoft has completed the software and has begun the release process to
enable the manufacturers to bring their products to market. The various
32-bit RISC microprocessors for the first H/PCs will be supplied by
Hitachi Ltd., NEC Electronics and Philips Semiconductor.
<P>
H/PCs have been designed to provide the millions of mobile professionals
using personal computers running the Windows operating system an
affordable, easy-to-use mobile PC companion to carry their most important
information when they are away from their personal computer. Handheld PCs
running Microsoft Windows CE provide an easy-to-learn user interface
incorporating many elements of the familiar Windows user interface, come
equipped with companion applications that work with the personal
information management and productivity applications customers know and
use every day, and provide seamless information synchronization with
Windows-based PCs.
<P>
The first H/PC devices are anticipated to be commercially available before
the end of the year, with street prices for base configurations expected
to start around $500.
