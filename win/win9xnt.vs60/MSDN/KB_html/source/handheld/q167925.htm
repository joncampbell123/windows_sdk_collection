<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use Handheld PC (H/PC) Explorer to move a file from one folder to
another on your H/PC, you may receive the following message:
<P>
<PRE>   This folder already contains a file called '&lt;filename&gt;'. Would you 
   Like to replace the existing file...?

</PRE>If you click Yes to overwrite the existing file, you may receive the 
following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Cannot move &lt;filename&gt;: Access is denied. Make sure the disk is not 
   full or write protected and that the file is not currently in use.

</PRE>If you click OK, the file that you attempted to overwrite is deleted.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs when all of the following conditions exist:

<UL><LI>A file with the same name as the file that you are attempting to 
   move already exists in the destination folder.

<LI>The file you are attempting to move is open on your H/PC.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, make sure the file is closed before you 
attempt to move it.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
