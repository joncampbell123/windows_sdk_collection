<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article is a checklist for troubleshooting distribution media format
(DMF) setup issues. Some of the issues mentioned here are covered elsewhere
in greater depth. Each section lists where you can find more information
about a particular subject. The following topics are covered:

<UL><LI>Damaged Disks
<LI>Maintenance Mode Setup
<LI>NT Version 3.1 Compatibility
<LI>Disk 2 Read Error--Setup Requests Disk 2 Again
<LI>Unable to decompress/read from .CAB file
<LI>Floptical Drives Can't Read DMF Disks
<LI>Older Gateway Handbooks Can't Read DMF Disks
<LI>Error Using DMF Disks on Power Mac Running SoftWindows
<LI>Error Using DMF Disks Under OS/2
<LI>Can't Back up DMF Disks to Floppy Disks
<LI>Virus Symptoms
<P>
</UL><h2>DAMAGED DISKS</h2>
 

<OL><P><LI>When you start your computer, bypass the configuration files by pressing
   F5 when you get the "Starting MS-DOS" prompt.

<P><LI>To make a directory called "disks," type the following at the MS-DOS
   prompt
<P>
<P><PRE>      md \disks
</PRE><P>
   and change to that directory by typing "cd \disks" (without the
   quotation marks).

<P><LI>   Copy the Extract.exe program from Microsoft Office disk 1. Note that
   Extract.exe is on disk 2 for Microsoft Office 97.

<P><LI>Put the disk causing the problem in the drive and type the following
<P>
<P><PRE>      extract /e &lt;drive&gt;:\msoff&lt;x&gt;.cab
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;drive&gt; is the floppy disk drive containing the Office disk and
   &lt;x&gt; is the number of the disk.
<P>
   NOTE: The Extract program may ask for additional disks. This behavior is
   normal.
<P>
</OL>If the files are not successfully extracted, the problem is probably not
configuration related and may be related to a damaged disk or a hardware
problem.
<P>
To obtain replacement Office disks, call the Microsoft Order Desk at
(800) 360-7561 and request a replacement for the damaged Microsoft Office
disk. If you are outside the United States, contact the Microsoft
subsidiary for your area. To locate your subsidiary, see the Microsoft
World Wide Offices Web site at:
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/worldwide/default.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/worldwide/default.htm</A></B>

</PRE></OL><h2>MAINTENANCE MODE SETUP</h2>
 
<P>
When you run Setup using the icon in Program Manager (Maintenance Mode
Setup), you may receive errors such as "Could not read file" when you
insert disks. This happens when Word was installed on the hard disk drive
with standard disks and you use DMF disks when prompted by Maintenance Mode
Setup. The Setup program on the hard drive cannot read the distribution
media format (DMF) disks.
<P>
For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../setup/q121802.htm">Q121802</A></B>
   TITLE     : "Could Not Read From File..." Running Maintenance Mode Setup

</PRE><h2>NT VERSION 3.1 COMPATIBILITY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Windows NT version 3.1 is not able to read DMF disks. A service
pack is available to correct this problem.
<P>
<P><h3>Workarounds</h3>
 
<P>
To correct this problem, do any of the following:
<P>
Method 1: Update your operating system by updating Floppy.sys or installing
<PRE>          Microsoft Windows NT Service Pack 3.

</PRE>Method 2: Contact Microsoft Product Support Services to obtain the latest
<PRE>          system files.

</PRE>Method 3: Contact Microsoft Sales Information Center at (800) 426-9400 for
<PRE>          standard (non-DMF) disks.

</PRE><h2>DISK 2 READ ERROR - SETUP REQUESTS DISK 2 AGAIN</h2>
 
<P>
Symptoms of this problem include:

<UL><LI>When you type DIR to display a directory of a DMF disk or a standard
   floppy disk at an MS-DOS prompt, garbage characters appear on the
   screen.

<LI>When you insert a different disk in the floppy disk drive, for example
   when you are running Setup, the new disk is not successfully read. This
   can cause Setup to request Disk 2 again, after you have already inserted
   Disk 2.
<P>
</UL><h3>Cause</h3>
 
<P>
This can happen in any of the following scenarios:
<P>
<PRE>   Case 1: The floppy disk drive is not reading the disks properly.

   If change-line support is not working properly, accessing a distribution
   media format (DMF) floppy disk fails.

   Change-line support informs MS-DOS when a disk and/or the format of a
   disk has changed. If MS-DOS determines the format of the first disk but
   does not realize that the formatting of the second disk is different,
   the second disk cannot be read.

   Case 2: Disk caching software isn't releasing the contents of the
           previous disk.

   Case 3: A virus has infected the hard drive or disks.

</PRE><h3>Workarounds</h3>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, use the method below for case that applies to
you:
<P>
<P><h3>Case 1 (Disk drive reads incorrectly)</h3>
 
<P>
Method 1: Add the MS-DOS DRIVPARM command to your Config.sys file.
<P>
<PRE>          Place the DRIVPARM command in the Config.sys with appropriate
          syntax for your floppy disk drive.

          For a 1.44-MB A drive      For a 1.44-MB B drive
          --------------------------------------------------

          DRIVPARM=/d:0 /f:7         DRIVPARM=/d:1 /f:7

   TITLE     : WinWord Setup Fails on Disk 2; Cannot Do DIR on 2nd Disk

</PRE>Method 2: Remove Disk 2 from your floppy disk drive and press ENTER. Then
<PRE>          reinsert Disk 2, and press ENTER again.

</PRE>Method 3: If Setup continues to request Disk 2, even though Disk 2 is in
<PRE>          the floppy disk drive, do the following:

          a. Press ALT+TAB to switch to File Manager (or to Program
             Manager, and then run File Manager).

          b. Select the drive icon that contains Disk 2, and press F5 to
             force a refresh.

          c. Press ALT+TAB again to switch back to Setup and continue.

   TITLE     : Setup Program Keeps Requesting Disk 2

</PRE><h3>Case 2 (Disk Caching software)</h3>
 
<P>
Disable the disk caching software. Commonly-used disk caching software
includes the following products:

<UL><LI>Super PC-Kwik
<LI>Lucid Lightning
<LI>Helix Netroom
<LI>The Cloaked DiskCache
<P>
</UL>For additional information, query on the specific product name in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base.
<P>
<P><h3>Case 3 (Virus)</h3>
 
<P>
While this is an unlikely possibility, Microsoft has received reports that
certain viruses will cause the Setup program not to recognize disk 2.
<P>
Scan the hard drive, using MS-DOS software or a third-party virus detector.
If a virus is found, remove the virus before reinstalling the software.
<P>
Microsoft has rigorous quality control measures to insure that viruses are
not on disks that we ship. The Setup disks for the programs listed
above are distributed virus-free.
<P>
For additional information, please see the following articles in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../setup/q105212.htm">Q105212</A></B>
   TITLE     : Office: Setup Problems May Indicate that System Has Virus

   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../zmiscellaneous/q80520.htm">Q80520</A></B>
   TITLE     : How Microsoft Ensures Virus-Free Software

</PRE>UNABLE TO DECOMPRESS/READ FROM .CAB FILE
 
<P>
You may receive an error that setup is unable to decompress or read from a
cabinet file (such as Word2.cab or Msoff2.cab) when running setup in
maintenance mode from your hard drive. If you receive this error running
setup in maintenance mode, exit setup and run setup from the installation
disk #1 instead.
<P>
Another possible cause of this error during an installation could be the
use of third-party disk caching software.
<P>
To work around this problem, disable the disk caching software and proceed
with setup. Commonly-used disk caching software includes the following
products:

<UL><LI>Super PC-Kwik
<LI>Lucid Lightning
<LI>Helix Netroom
<LI>The Cloaked DiskCache
<P>
</UL><h2>FLOPTICAL DRIVES CAN'T READ DMF DISKS</h2>
 
<P>
Floptical (and other SCSI floppy drives) cannot read DMF disks because the
drive hardware has fixed assumptions about standard floppy formats.
<P>
<P><h3>Workaround</h3>
 
<P>
Contact Microsoft Sales Information Center at (800) 426-9400 to obtain
standard (non-DMF) disks.
<P>
<P><h2>OLDER GATEWAY HANDBOOKS CAN'T READ DMF DISKS</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Workaround</h3>
 
<P>
Older Gateway Handbook machines have Flash BIOS which needs to be updated.
<P>
Method 1: Contact Gateway for a BIOS update.
<P>
Method 2: Contact Microsoft Sales Information Center at (800) 426-9400 and
<PRE>          order standard (non-DMF) disks.

</PRE><h2>ERROR USING DMF DISKS ON POWER MAC RUNNING SOFTWINDOWS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run the Setup program for one of the applications listed above on
an Apple Power Macintosh computer running SoftWindows, your computer may
not read the Setup disks. The Setup program may fail to recognize disk 2
and will continue to prompt you for disk 2 after you've inserted it in the
disk drive.
<P>
For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../setup/q122279.htm">Q122279</A></B>
   TITLE     : Error Installing Application on Power Mac Running
               SoftWindows

</PRE><h2>Error Using DMF Disks Under OS/2</h2>
 
<P>
Setup of any of the products listed above was not tested on OS/2 or OS/2
Warp Version 3. For additional information, please see the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../setup/q122280.htm">Q122280</A></B>
   TITLE     : Error Running Setup from DMF Disks Under OS/2

</PRE><h2>CAN'T BACKUP DMF DISKS TO FLOPPIES</h2>
 
<P>
DMF is a new disk format which allows more information to fit on each disk.
Because of this format, disks cannot be backed up. In the past, making
backup disks was a necessary part of installation. Now, better hardware and
software means backup disks are seldom, if ever, needed.
<P>
If you do want backup disks, you may order them by calling Microsoft Sales
Information Center at (800) 426-9400. There is a small handling charge of
$5.00, which is less than the price of new, blank disks.
<P>
<P><h2>VIRUS SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Any of the symptoms listed above may also be symptoms of a virus. If you
suspect that a virus is present on your computer, scan the hard drive and
disks with a virus detector. If a virus is found, remove the virus before
running Setup again.
<P>
Microsoft has rigorous quality control measures to insure that viruses are
not on disks that we ship. The Setup disks for the applications listed
above are distributed virus-free in sealed clear plastic envelopes that
display a message about the Microsoft software license agreement. If disks
are purchased in any other type of package, they should not be used.
<P>
The following viruses are known to cause problems when Setup is run from
DMF disks:
<P>
<PRE>   antiEXE  NOINT  Junkie  A-Dign  B1  V-Sign RIPPER
