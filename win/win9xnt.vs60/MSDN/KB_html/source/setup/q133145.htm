<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run an administrative installation (setup /a) on a workstation
connected to a LANtastic network server, for one of the applications listed
above, you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Setup was unable to determine a valid default destination folder. You
   will need to specify a destination folder.

</PRE>When you click OK, a dialog box appears for you to choose a valid
destination folder. However, the network server drive is not available to
choose a folder from. The box that displays the current drive shows the
LANtastic network server drive, however if you click this drive, you
receive an "error accessing drive" error message. Additionally, if you
click the Network button on this dialog box, the following error message
appears:
<P>
<PRE>   No Network available

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs because LANtastic currently has no client software for
Microsoft Windows 95. Because of this, a connected LANtastic server appears
as a "Remote Disk" in Windows 95, and not a network connected drive.
Because there is no actual network installed in Windows 95 to handle this,
UNC connections are not activated.
<P>
When you connect to a LANtastic network server drive in Windows 95, Windows
sees this drive as a remote drive, instead of a network drive. For example,
in Windows Explorer, a LANtastic drive is displayed with the normal local
hard disk icon. If you view the properties for a LANtastic network server
drive object, the Type value is Remote.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Perform an administrative installation (setup/a) of Microsoft Office
   to a folder on a local workstation.

<P><LI>Copy the files from the local workstation to the network server.

<P><LI>At the workstation, run Setup from the network server.
<P>
</OL>NOTES: When you use this procedure, the shared application files will be
copied to your local workstation. Additionally, when you run setup from the
network server after using this procedure, you receive a Connection error.
However, you can ignore this error message; it will not affect the behavior
of Setup or Microsoft Office.
