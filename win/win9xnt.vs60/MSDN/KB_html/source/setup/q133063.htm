<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run the Setup program for one of the applications listed above,
the ~Mssetup.t\~Msstfqf.t folder may be left on your hard disk after Setup
is complete.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior only occurs if you run Setup by double-clicking the Setup
shortcut in the Microsoft Office folder or by using the Add/Remove Office
Programs command on the Office Shortcut Bar menu. This behavior may also
occur when you run Setup from the Add/Remove Programs icon in the Windows
Control Panel.
<P>
This behavior occurs because when you run Setup using one of these methods,
Setup must restart your computer in order to delete some files that are
created and used temporarily during Setup. However, Setup cannot remove
folders from your hard disk while your computer is restarting, therefore
the ~Mssetup.t\~Msstfqf.t folder is left on your hard disk.
<P>
This behavior occurs when Setup prompts you to restart your computer after
Setup, and only occurs when you run Setup in maintenance mode. This
behavior occurs when you run Setup using one of the methods described above
even if you use the Remove All feature.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this behavior, you can use Windows Explorer or My Computer
to delete these temporary folders if they still appear on your hard disk
after Setup is complete.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
