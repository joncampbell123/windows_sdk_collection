The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for Windows 95, version 7.0
<LI>Microsoft Office for Windows, versions 4.0, 4.2, 4.2c, 4.3, 4.3c
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 6.0, 6.0a
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, version 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run a workstation installation of one of the above applications on
a computer running Microsoft Windows from a server, the Open Database
Connectivity (ODBC) files are installed to your personal Windows directory,
even if the Server option was selected as the location for shared
applications during the administrative installation.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is caused by the way the ODBC files are installed. The ODBC
driver files are always installed to your user directory when you run a
workstation installation and are running Microsoft Windows from a server.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To prevent the ODBC files from being installed in your personal Windows
directory, you can edit the SETUP.STF file. Note that if you make these
changes to the SETUP.STF file, ODBC functionality is NOT installed and is
not available on the workstation.
<P>
NOTE: Each application that uses ODBC installs the ODBC files if they are
not already on your computer. Therefore, to prevent installation of these
files, you must edit the SETUP.STF file for each application you install
that uses ODBC. For example, if you modify the SETUP.STF file for Microsoft
Word for Windows and then perform a workstation installation of Microsoft
Excel for Windows, the ODBC files are installed.
<P>
WARNING: This modification is not supported by Microsoft Product Support
Services (PSS). Although PSS will support some modifications to a BACKUP
copy of the SETUP.STF file and will help customers modify specific lines of
an STF, we will not rewrite the entire file in order to achieve a desired
configuration. As a general rule, support is limited to options that can
normally be changed by a user during a standard installation of the
application.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Edit SETUP.STF</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Make a backup copy of your SETUP.STF file.

<P><LI>Open SETUP.STF in Microsoft Excel (or another suitable text editor).
<P>
   NOTE: If you open SETUP.STF in Microsoft Excel 5.0, complete the
   following additional steps before continuing:
<P>
<P><PRE>      a. In the Text Import Wizard dialog box, choose Next until Step 3
<PRE></PRE>         Of 3 appears.

      b. In the Text Import Wizard - Step 3 Of 3 dialog box, under Data
         Preview, click the second column to select it. Under Column Data
         Format, select the Text option, and choose Finish.

</PRE><P><LI>Make the changes outlined below (that is, find each object ID listed in
   the Object ID column and change the corresponding "Install During Batch
   Mode" entry in the .STF file to match the value in the appropriate table
   below). If the entry in the table is "(blank)," clear whatever text is
   in the cell and leave it blank.
<P>
</OL>NOTES:

<UL><LI>If the Object ID and Title values in your .STF file do not correspond as
   in the appropriate table below, use the Title column as your reference
   for changing the "Install During Batch Mode" value.

<LI>The modifications to the Microsoft Office SETUP.STF file include changes
   to work around a problem running a quiet-mode installation in which
   Setup can install only Microsoft Excel 5.0 and its components. For more
   information about this problem, query on the following words in the
   Microsoft Knowledge Base:
