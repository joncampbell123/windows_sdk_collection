<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you install one of the applications listed at the beginning of this
article, the virtual device driver file, VSHARE.386, is installed if it is
not already installed. This device replaces the functionality of the MS-DOS
device driver SHARE.EXE. If you then run the Setup program in maintenance
mode, and you choose the Reinstall button, the VSHARE.386 file is not
installed on your computer. Additionally, when you restart Windows, you
receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Cannot find a device file that may be needed to run Windows
   Make sure that the PATH line in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file points to the
   directory that contains the file and that it exists on your hard disk.
   If the file does not exist, try running Setup to install it or remove
   any references to it from your SYSTEM.INI file.
   VSHARE.386
   Press any key to continue

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
If the VSHARE.386 file is not located on your computer, this file is
not installed when you run the Setup program in maintenance mode and
choose to reinstall the files. If the "device=vshare.386" line is not
in the [386enh] section in your SYSTEM.INI file, this line is written
to the SYSTEM.INI file as expected when you reinstall the files.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To reinstall the VSHARE.386 file on your computer, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Decompress or extract the file from your Setup disks and copy the file
   to your WINDOWS\SYSTEM subdirectory.
<P>
   VSHARE.386 is located on the following disks:
