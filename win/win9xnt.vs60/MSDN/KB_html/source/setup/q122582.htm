<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run the Setup program for one of the programs listed at the
beginning of this article, you receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Bad Setup Version field

</PRE>followed by:
<P>
<PRE>   Processing Top Level information failed

   -and-

   Setup was not completed successfully

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
You receive these error messages when you run the Setup program if you
have modified the program's setup table file, Setup.stf, using a text
editor that replaces tabs in the Setup.stf file with spaces.
<P>
For example, if you use the MS-DOS Editor, Edit.com, to modify the
Setup.stf, tabs in the Setup.stf file are replaced with spaces when you
save the file. This modification causes the Setup to fail when the Setup
program tries to read the Setup.stf file.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
WARNING: This modification may not be supported by Microsoft. Microsoft
support engineers will support some modifications to a BACKUP copy of the
Setup.stf file. Note also that while support engineers may help customers
modify specific lines of an STF, we will not rewrite the entire file in
order to achieve a desired configuration. As a general rule, support is
limited to options that can normally be changed by a user during a
standard installation of the application.
<P>
In Microsoft Office for Windows 95, version 7.0 and Microsoft Office 97
for Windows programs, use Notepad to modify the Setup.stf file.
<P>
To avoid receiving this error message in versions prior to Office for
Windows 95, version 7.0, use a spreadsheet program, such as Microsoft
Excel, to modify the Setup.stf file. You should always make a backup of
the Setup.stf file before making any changes.
<P>
If your Setup.stf file has been edited incorrectly, you must rename or
delete the Setup.stf file, and run the program's Setup program again to
create a new copy of the Setup.stf file.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
You can create a script to run Setup automatically and control how Setup
installs an program. The information that controls how the program is
installed is contained in the program's Setup.stf file.
<P>
For more information on editing the Setup.stf file, run the Acreadme.hlp
file located on the setup Disk 1, and choose the "Network Installations"
topic, and then choose the "Creating Custom Installations for Workstation
Users" topic.
<P>
