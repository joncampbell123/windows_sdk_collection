<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The following information discusses how to perform an administrative
installation (by pressing the COMMAND key while running Setup) of any one
of the applications listed above.
<P>
This information is contained in the following sections:

<UL><LI>Setting Up the Application on a Network
<LI>Before you Set Up the Application
<LI>About the Installation Types
<LI>Installing the Application on a Server
<LI>Installing the Application on a Workstation
<P>
</UL><h2>SETTING UP THE APPLICATION ON A NETWORK</h2>
 
<P>
You can install the application in a networked environment using either of
two methods. One method allows network users to install and run the
application on their local workstations--a convenient alternative to
installing from floppy disks. The other method sets up network users' local
workstations so they can run the application from the server--useful if
workstation disk space is a concern. In either case, setting up the
application on a network is a two-step process:
<P>
<PRE>   1. Install the application on the network server
   2. Set up the application on the workstations

</PRE><h2>BEFORE YOU SET UP THE APPLICATION</h2>
 
<P>
Before you setup the application, the following must be true:

<UL><LI>The network must be operational

<LI>All users connected to the network file server or share on which you
   want to install the application are logged off
<P>
   NOTE: Although this step may not be necessary in your case, it is
   strongly recommended that users be logged off of the network before you
   perform an administrative installation. Setup may run successfully while
   users are logged on to the file server; however, if a user accesses a
   file or folder while it is currently being used by Setup, Setup may be
   interrupted.
<P>
   Additionally, if you are installing a newer version of an application
   while users are logged on to the file server and possibly using files
   that you are upgrading, this will also cause Setup to fail.

<LI>You must have read-write access to the network folders in which you want
   to install the application and its shared components
<P>
</UL>For more information, see your network software documentation.

<UL><LI>If you are using a virus detection utility, disable it before you run
   Setup. You should do this on both the file server (before you run an
   administrative installation) and on the workstation (before you perform
   setup on a workstation) If you do not disable the utility, Setup may
   conflict with it and not run.
<P>
</UL>This article assumes that you know how to use network software to
connect to network drives and how to find files stored on network
computers.
<P>
NOTE: Every user that uses the application must have a license for
that application. A license is obtained by buying a retail package or
a Microsoft License Pak. For more information on network use
restrictions, see your application license agreement.
<P>
<P><h2>ABOUT THE INSTALLATION TYPES</h2>
 
<P>
During installation, you are asked to choose an installation type
that is dependent upon the types of workstations supported.

<UL><LI>Macintosh: Installs a copy of the application that is optimized to run
   on Macintosh models with a 68020 or higher microprocessor. If installed
   on a Power Macintosh, the application runs in Macintosh emulation mode,
   and consequently runs slower.

<LI>Power Macintosh: Installs a copy of the application that is optimized to
   run on the Power Macintosh. This option is not available when Setup is
   run on standard Macintosh systems.

<LI>Macintosh and Power Macintosh: Installs a copy of the application that
   is optimized to run on either Macintosh or Power Macintosh. When you
   install the application on a network server, and you have users with
   both Macintosh and Power Macintosh systems, it is recommended that
   you choose the Macintosh and Power Macintosh installation type. This
   allows a single server installation to service users of either system.
   The Macintosh and Power Macintosh installation type requires more disk
   space, and is also intended for use on Macintosh workstations that have
   installed a Power Macintosh compatible upgrade card.
<P>

Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : MXL5: Macintosh/Power Macintosh Type Doesn't Install Both

</PRE><h2>INSTALLING THE APPLICATION ON A SERVER</h2>
 
<P>
Before users can install the application on a workstation from the
network, you must install it on the network server.
<P>
<P><h3>To Install the Application on a Server</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>If you are using a virus-detection utility, remove the utility from the
   Extensions folder in your System Folder. Then restart your Macintosh. If
   you do not disable the virus-detection utility, Setup may conflict with
   it and not run properly.

<P><LI>Insert the application's Install Disk 1 in the floppy disk drive.

<P><LI>Double-click the application's Setup icon while holding down the COMMAND
   key. Continue holding down the COMMAND key until the first Setup dialog
   box appears.

<P><LI>Select the installation mode.
<P>
   - Mode 1 copies the disk images to the network server folder you
<P><PRE>     specify, from which users can run Typical, Complete/Custom, or Minimum
     installations. This option installs the application on the network
     server and allows users to install a copy on their individual
     workstations.
</PRE><P>
   - Mode 2 copies all of the files to the network server folder you
<P><PRE>     specify, and allows users to run only a Workstation installation. When
     a user runs a workstation install, only a few necessary files (system
     files) are copied to the local system, while most of the files are
     used directly from the server location.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>     If you select Mode 2, you must also select the Macintosh, Power
     Macintosh, or Macintosh and Power Macintosh installation type. For
     more information about these installation types, see the "About the
     Installation Types" section above.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Follow the instructions on the screen.
<P>
</OL>If any open applications might cause problems, Setup asks you to
close them. Setup also prompts you to do the following:

<UL><LI>specify your organization name
<LI>write down the product ID number on your registration card
<LI>and specify the name of the folder that will contain the application

</UL><OL><P><LI>Set the access privileges to read-only for the server folders in which
   you installed the application's components. Also, make sure all users
   who will install the application on their workstations from the network
   have read privileges for those folders.
<P>
</OL>You may also want to rearrange the icons in the application folder,
for example, you might want to make the Microsoft Setup icon the easiest
icon to access.
<P>
<P><h2>INSTALLING THE APPLICATION ON A WORKSTATION</h2>
 
<P>
After the network administrator installs the application on the
network server, it can then be installed on workstations. This method
of installation from a network server saves time and is more
convenient than installing the application from disks.
<P>
NOTE: Whether you can install the application on your machine or just
run it from a network server depends on the way the network
administrator installed the application on the network server. Even
if the server installation is designed to allow users to run the
application from the server, do not try to run the application from
the server without first performing a workstation installation.
Certain files must first be installed in each workstation's System
Folder.
<P>
<P><h3>To Install the Application on a Workstation</h3>
 
<P>
This procedure assumes the network administrator has completed the
procedure "To Install the Application on a Server" in the "Installing
The Application On A Server" section above.

<OL><P><LI>If you are using a virus-detection utility, remove the utility from the
   Extensions folder in your System Folder, and restart your Macintosh. If
   you do not disable the virus-detection utility, Setup may conflict with
   it and not run properly.

<P><LI>From the workstation on which you want to install the application, log
   on to the network and connect to the drive and folder that contains the
   application's Setup file. Your network administrator will tell you the
   location and name of the drive and folder.

<P><LI>Double-click the application's Setup icon.

<P><LI>Follow the instructions on the screen. Setup does the following:
<P>
   - Asks you to close any open applications.
<P>
   - Asks you to type your name and may prompt you for the name of your
<P><PRE>     organization (optional). After you choose the OK button, you have one
     chance to confirm that the information is correct.
</PRE><P>
   - Asks you to supply the location where you want to install the
<P><PRE>     application, and then checks your system and the available hard disk
     space.
</PRE><P>
   - Asks you to choose the Macintosh, Power Macintosh, or Macintosh and
<P><PRE>     Power Macintosh installation type. For more information, see the
     "About the Installation Types" section above.
</PRE><P>
   - Asks you to choose the type of installation you want to perform:
<P><PRE>     Typical, Complete/Custom, or Minimum. If you choose the
     Complete/Custom button, a dialog box appears allowing you to specify
     the components you want to install. Click the check box next to an
     item to select components you want installed; clear the check box for
     items that you don't want installed.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Depending on the options you select, you may need to respond to
   additional dialog boxes.

<P><LI>When Setup is complete, choose the OK button to exit Setup or to restart
   your Macintosh, if necessary.
<P>
</OL><h3>To Install the Application on a Workstation to Run From a Network Server</h3>
 
<P>
This procedure assumes the network administrator has completed the
procedure, "To Install the Application on a Server" in the
"Installing The Application On A Server" section above.

<OL><P><LI>If you are using a virus-detection utility, remove the utility from the
   Extensions folder in your System Folder. Then restart your Macintosh. If
   you do not disable the virus-detection utility, Setup may conflict with
   it and not run properly.

<P><LI>From the workstation on which you want to install the application, log
   on to the network and connect to the drive and folder that contains
   the application's Setup file. Your network administrator will tell you
   the location and name of the drive and folder.

<P><LI>Double-click the application's Setup icon.

<P><LI>Follow the instructions on the screen. Setup does the following:
<P>
   - Asks you to close any open applications.
<P>
   - Asks you to type your name. After you choose the OK button, you have
<P><PRE>     one chance to confirm that the information is correct.
</PRE><P>
   - Asks you to supply the location where you want to install the
<P><PRE>     application, and then checks your system and the available hard disk
     space.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Depending on the options you select, you may need to respond to
   additional dialog boxes.

<P><LI>When Setup is complete, choose the OK button to exit Setup or to restart
   your Macintosh, if necessary.
