<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run the Setup program for one of the programs listed
at the beginning of this article, you may receive the following error
message multiple times at the end of Setup
<P>
<PRE>   Unable to show Program Manager group : '&lt;group name&gt;'

</PRE>and the program icons are added to the active group in Program Manager.
<P>
You receive this error message one time for each item that the Setup
program attempts to add to the group. Additionally, the program icons
are added to the active group in Program Manager.
<P>
Note that this behavior does not affect the functionality of the
program. The Setup program is completed successfully.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs when you do either of the following:

<UL><LI>You enter an invalid program manager group name in the dialog box that
   prompts you to select a group to contain the program icons. For example,
   if you enter the group name "\", the Setup program continues and the
   program files are copied to your computer. However, when the Setup
   program switches to Program Manager to create the group, you receive the
   error message.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>If the maximum number of program groups is reached and no new groups can
   be created. In Microsoft Windows 3.1 you will receive this error message
   if you have 40 program groups.
<P>
</UL>Note that this problem also occurs when you run Setup in maintenance mode
if you remove the Microsoft Office Group and then add groups until you
reach the maximum number. When Setup tries to re-add the icons, you receive
the same error message.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
If the above error message was caused by an invalid character in the group
name, use Method 1. If the error message was caused because there are
too many program groups, use Method 2.
<P>
Method 1: To avoid receiving this error message, enter a valid Program
<PRE>          Manager group name, or select an existing group when the Setup
          program prompts you to select a group to contain your program
          icons.

          Note that valid names must include an alphabetic or numeric
          character. For example, the name "\" is not valid, but "\test" is
          a valid name.

          If the Setup program adds your program icons to the incorrect
          group, create a new group in Program Manager and drag the program
          icons to this new group.

</PRE>Method 2: To properly complete the installation, use the following steps:
<P>
<PRE>          1. Press ALT+TAB to return to Program Manager.

          2. Identify at least one group that you can move the icons from.

          3. Move the icons from the identified group to another program
             group.

          4. Delete the now empty program group.

          5. Press ALT+TAB until you see the Office Setup screen.

          6. Click the Continue button.
