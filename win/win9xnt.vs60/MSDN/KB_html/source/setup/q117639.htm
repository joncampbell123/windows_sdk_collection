<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you run the Setup program for one of the programs listed at the
beginning of this article and choose the Complete/Custom installation
option, if the Space Available On C: value is less than the Space Required
On C: value, one of the following situations occurs when you continue with
the Setup program:

<UL><LI>The installation is completed successfully.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>You receive the error message "Not Enough Space on Drive C:." This
   message appears in a dialog box that displays the Space Required On
   Drive C: value again, and this value is less than the value that was
   previously displayed.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs because the disk space value that is displayed in the
Custom/Complete Setup dialog box does not account for any files that are
already installed on your computer.
<P>
Because of this, in some cases, it is possible to successfully install the
program, even if the Setup dialog box indicates that the program
files require more disk space than you have available on your computer.
<P>
If you receive the dialog box with the message telling you that you do not
have enough disk space, a second value for the Disk Space Required On Drive
C: is displayed. This second value is generally smaller than the initial
value in the Setup dialog box because it is calculated after taking into
consideration any files that are already installed. The calculation for
this value also takes considerably more time than the calculation for the
initial value.
