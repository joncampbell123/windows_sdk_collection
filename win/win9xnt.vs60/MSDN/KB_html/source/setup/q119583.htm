The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows, version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Works for Windows, version 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Setup program may produce the following error message when
updating the system files (at the end of the setup process):
<P>
<PRE>   Invalid Obj Id 78

</PRE>This error can be caused if Setup cannot write to the WIN.INI file.
Object ID 78 in the SETUP.STF file is trying to add the [MS User Info]
section to the WIN.INI file. Make sure this file is not corrupt, in use by
another applications, or too large.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To troubleshoot this problem, try one of the following methods:

<OL><P><LI>Check to see if the WIN.INI file is corrupt. Open the WIN.INI file in a
   text editor such as Notepad, and check for extended characters, or
   missing information or sections. (If the WIN.INI file is too large, you
   will receive an error message that Notepad cannot open the file. See
   method 3.)
<P>
   If the WIN.INI file is corrupt, try renaming the existing WIN.INI file
   and expanding WIN.SR_ from your Windows disk to WIN.INI (in the Windows
   directory). For more information about this procedure, query on the
   following words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<P><PRE>      win.ini and win.sr_ and create
</PRE>
<P><LI>Before running Setup, close all other applications that may conflict
   with writing to the WIN.INI file, and perform a clean boot of the
   system.
<P>
   For more information about this procedure, query on the following words
   in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<P><PRE>      tshoot and gpf and clean and boot and works
</PRE>
<P><LI>The WIN.INI file is limited to 64K. As the size of this file
   increases, unusual behavior may occur in Windows. This includes
   general protection (GP) faults, "Out of Memory" error messages,
   inability of programs to open or write to the file.
<P>
   Use File Manager to verify that the file is not too large, or try
   opening it in Notepad. If the WIN.INI file is too large, you will
   receive an error message that Notepad cannot open the file.
<P>
   The WIN.INI file may become too large if there are a lot of duplicated
   sections and lines in the file. Make a backup of the WIN.INI file and
   open WIN.INI in a text editor such as Notepad to edit and remove any
   duplicated sections or lines.
