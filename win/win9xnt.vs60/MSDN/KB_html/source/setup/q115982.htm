<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you run the Setup program for one of the programs listed above, there
are certain rules that are followed for copying and removing files on your
hard disk drive. If you run the Setup program again, after installing the
program (maintenance mode), you can choose to install additional components
or remove components from your system. The following is a list of the rules
that the Setup program uses.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Setup program uses the following rules when copying and removing files
on your hard disk drive:

<OL><P><LI>Setup should not remove anything that it cannot replace.
<P>
   a. Setup can remove older versions of components that you ship if and
<P><PRE>      only if setup has the information needed to remove the component.
</PRE><P>
   b. Programs may REQUIRE that a shared component be upgraded because of
<P><PRE>      version incompatibilities.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Shared components can be removed if the Setup program knows how to
   remove and reinstall them.

<P><LI>There are four states that a component can be in: Not Installed, To Be
   Installed, Installed, and To Be Removed. There are two possible actions:
   Install and Remove.

<P><LI>Without system support, the Setup program cannot be sure that the
   configuration hasn't changed. You may have deleted or changed a file by
   hand, or another program may have replaced shared/common files.
   Keeping a database of what is installed is not secure.
