<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you run a workstation installation of any of the Microsoft
applications listed above and you choose to install the shared applications
to the network server (or this option was selected during the
administrative installation [SETUP /A]), the [MSAPPS] section of the
WIN.INI file contains path information that is not used for the shared
applications.
<P>
The actual locations for the applications referenced in the [MSAPPS]
section will be found in the [Embedding] section. This section is
synchronized with the REG.DAT file to provide OLE functionality for
these shared applications.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When you run a workstation installation and the shared applications
are installed to the server, the path information contained in the
[MSAPPS] section of the WIN.INI file points to an MSAPPS location
under your Windows directory, which may be on your local hard disk
drive or on a server. For example, if you have Windows installed on
your C: drive and you run a workstation installation of Microsoft
Excel, choosing to install the shared applications to the server (or
this option was chosen during the administrative setup), your WIN.INI
file contains the following information:
<P>
<PRE>   [MSAPPS]
   MSAPPS=C:\WIN31\MSAPPS
   GRPHFLT=C:\WIN31\MSAPPS\GRPHFLT
   PROOF=C:\WIN31\MSAPPS\PROOF
   MSINFO=C:\WIN31\MSAPPS\MSINFO
   MSQUERY=C:\WIN31\MSAPPS\MSQUERY

</PRE>This behavior is by design. The information in the [MSAPPS] section
is not the location of the shared applications, but rather where the
shared applications would be located if they could not be shared. In most
cases, the shared applications can be installed to the server, and they are
run from the server (as expected) even though the path information in the
[MSAPPS] section in the WIN.INI file points to the local hard disk drive.
<P>
For more information about where the MSAPPS files are installed when you
run a workstation installation, query on the following in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   workstation and setup and msapps and locally

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The location of the individual shared applications is determined by the
path information in the individual sections in the WIN.INI file. For
example, when you run a workstation installation of Microsoft Excel from
the server F:\EXCEL, the following entries are added to your WIN.INI file:
<P>
<PRE>   [MS Graphic Import Filters]
   Computer Graphics Metafile(.CGM)=F:\EXCEL\MSAPPS\GRPHFLT\CGMIMP.FLT,CGM
   Encapsulated Postscript(.EPS)= F:\EXCEL\MSAPPS\GRPHFLT\EPSIMP.FLT,EPS
   HP Graphic Language(.HGL)= F:\EXCEL\MSAPPS\GRPHFLT\HPGLIMP.FLT,HGL

   [Microsoft System Info]
   MSINFO= F:\EXCEL\MSAPPS\MSINFO\MSINFO.EXE

   When you import a picture, the graphic filter is located using the
   path information in the [MS Graphic Import Filters] section of your
   WIN.INI file, not the [MSAPPS] section.
