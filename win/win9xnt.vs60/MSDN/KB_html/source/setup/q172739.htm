<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you restart Microsoft Windows 95 after you perform a Run From
Network Server installation of one of the products listed at the beginning
of this article, you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Error 0001: One or more drive connections are incorrect.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may occur if you perform a Run From Network Server
installation on a diskless or a Remote Program Load (RPL) computer.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this behavior, install the program on a computer on which
Microsoft Windows is running from the local hard disk.
<P>
If you have installed Office 97 on a diskless or RPL computer and you are
receiving the error message that is described in this article, ask the
system administrator to restore the system registry in the folder for the
computer on the server. The system administrator can do this by following
these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Rename System.dat and User.dat

<P><LI>Copy System.da0 to System.dat and copy User.da0 to User.dat
<P>
</OL>If any of the Office programs are started, the registry entries for the
program are re-created and the error message may reoccur. To avoid this
problem, ask the system administrator to uninstall (completely remove)
Office 97 from the folder on the computer. The system administrator can do
this by following these steps.
<P>
NOTE: The option to remove Office 97 by using the Add/Remove Programs tool
in Control Panel is not available.

<OL><P><LI>Remove the following items from the Windows\Start
   Menu\Programs\Startup folder:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Microsoft Fast Find
      Office Startup
      Microsoft Office Shortcut Bar
</PRE>
<P><LI>Remove the following shortcuts from the Windows\Start Menu\Programs
   folder:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Microsoft Access
      Microsoft Binder
      Microsoft Excel
      Microsoft Outlook
      Microsoft PowerPoint
      Microsoft Word
</PRE>
<P><LI>Remove the following shortcuts from the Windows\Start Menu folder:
<P>
<P><PRE>      New Office Document
      Open Office Document
</PRE>
<P><LI>Remove the Microsoft Office folder.
<P>
   The location may vary depending on the configuration of the server.

<P><LI>Restart the workstation.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The products listed at the beginning of this article work with a server-
based installation in which the System.dat remains in one location. On a
diskless or RPL computer running Windows 95, the System.dat is partially
stored on the floppy boot disk or in the RPL image and is partially stored
in the computer folder on the server.
