<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run the Setup program for your program in maintenance mode and you
select a component to add, the Space Required On &lt;drive&gt; value displayed in
the Setup dialog box (where &lt;drive&gt; is the drive to which the component
will be installed) is incorrect for the item that you are adding.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when you use the Add/Remove button in maintenance mode
Setup and you select a component in the Setup dialog box because the Setup
program does not actually check to see which files have already been
installed on your computer. Instead, Setup checks the Setup.stf file to see
which files have been selected for installation, and then compares this
list of files against the file sizes stored in the Setup ".inf" file
(Off95std.inf for Office version 7.0). Because of this behavior, the value
displayed in the Space Required field includes the disk space required for
all the components you have already installed, instead of displaying only
the disk space required for the components you are installing.
<P>
For example, if you run the Microsoft Office version 7.0 Setup program in
maintenance mode after you perform a Typical installation, and you select
the Word Art component (Office Tools option), the Space Required value in
the Office Tools dialog box is the sum of the disk space required for the
Word Art component (773K) and the disk space required for the other Office
Tools components that are selected, even though these components are
already installed on your computer.
<P>
Additionally, in this case, when you click OK in the Office Tools dialog
box, the Space Required value in the Maintenance dialog box is the sum of
the disk space required for the Word Art component and the disk space
required for the other Office components that are selected, even though
these components are already installed on your computer.
<P>
Note that this behavior does not cause a problem when you actually run
Setup. Setup only requires the amount of available disk space for the
components that you select, even though the dialog box requests more disk
space.
