<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you choose not to restart Windows after you install one of the
applications listed above, you receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Setup is not yet complete. You need to exit Windows and run the
   following application from DOS and then restart Windows:

      C:\WINDOWS\_MSRSTRT.EXE

   After restarting Windows, Setup will be complete.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
During the setup program, _MSRSTRT.EXE runs a file called _MSSETUP.BAT,
deletes the _MSSETUP.BAT file, deletes itself, and then restarts Windows.
If you choose not to restart Windows, this procedure is left undone.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
When you receive this error message, you should exit Microsoft Windows at
the next available opportunity and run the _MSRSTRT.EXE application which
is located in your Windows directory.
<P>
Note that the file _MSRSTRT.EXE is created by the Setup program and is not
on any of the original disks.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The _MSRSTRT.EXE application is designed to replace/remove components of
the application you are installing that may be in use by the operating
system. Components that are in use by Microsoft Windows cannot be replaced
or removed during the current Microsoft Windows session: therefore, it is
necessary to exit Microsoft Windows to accomplish this task. When you run
the _MSRSTRT.EXE application from MS-DOS, the proper components are
replaced/removed and the setup process is completed.
<P>
Restart can be caused by:
<P>
- Replacing files marked "system" in the INF when that file is in use by
<PRE>  another application/Windows.

</PRE>- Installing TTF files when TTF Control Panel flag is disabled.
<P>
- Installing VSHARE.386
<P>
- CustomAction performing restart for some reason.
<P>
_MSSETUP.BAT is created during the setup procedure. The batch file deletes
the temporary directory, ~msstfqf.f, that Setup used to install the
application. It also loads the Share program, or VSHARE.386 if it is not
loaded already.
<P>
_MSSETUP.BAT is a text file and can be opened in any text editor.
<P>
There is no pratical ways to disable the restart operation, but with
another application you can force an abort of this process by handling the
WM_QUERYENDSESSION message and dismissing the Setup dialogs to follow.
<P>
For more information about the Share program, query on the following words
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
