<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run Setup with a slash (/) and a question mark (?), for
example
<P>
<PRE>   setup /?

</PRE>you receive a Setup - Usage dialog box with the following information
instead of a dialog box with information about all the possible Setup
switches you can use:
<P>
<PRE>   Usage: Setup or Setup /A
   Setup /A runs the Setup program in Administrator mode.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Typically, when you run a command with a slash and a question mark, you
receive information on the screen about how to use the command you entered
with the different switches available for that command. However, when you
perform this action with the Setup program for any of the applications
listed above, you receive information about using the /A switch to run the
Setup program in Administrator mode, even though there are additional
switches that you can use with the Setup program.
<P>
Note that when you run Setup with an invalid switch or /? in an earlier
version of the applications listed above, you only receive the Setup -
Usage dialog box describing the /A switch.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this behavior and display a dialog box that describes the
different switches available to use with the SETUP.EXE file, run Setup with
the slash character and no character following. For example, type:
<P>
<PRE>   setup /

</PRE>When you click OK, you receive a Setup Error 530 dialog box with the
following information:
<P>
<PRE>   This is an invalid command line option:
   /

</PRE>When you click OK, you receive a dialog box with information about the
switches that you can use with the Setup program. To see the description
that is displayed, see the "More Information" section below.
<P>
Note that this same behavior occurs when you run Setup with any invalid
switch such as /x or /xxx.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you run Setup with an invalid switch, a Setup--Usage dialog box
appears with the following information:
<P>
<PRE>   Usage:

   setup [/A] [/G filename] [/Q[0|1|T]] [/R] [/U[A]] [/Y]

   /A           Administrator mode
   /G filename  Generate logfile of installation activity
   /Q[0|1|T]    Quiet install mode (0 shows exit, 1 hides exit, T hides
                all display)
   /R           Reinstall the applications
   /U[A]        Uninstall the application but leave shared components
                (/UA to remove all)
   /Y           Install without copying files
