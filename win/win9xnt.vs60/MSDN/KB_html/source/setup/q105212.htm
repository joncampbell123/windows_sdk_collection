<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If your computer is infected with the "Stoned" virus, one or more of
the following situations may occur when you run the setup program for
one of the applications listed above:

<UL><LI>When you install one of the applications listed above, the setup fails:
   the individual application disk has no SETUP.EXE file.
<P>
   -and/or-

<LI>The application Setup disk contains approximately half the number of
   required files.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>When you attempt to install Office with the integrated setup, the
   following error message appears :
<P>
<P><PRE>      Cannot access SETUP.LST
</PRE><P>
   -or-

<LI>The last file in a directory of the Setup disk has an illegal filename,
   usually beginning with a Greek symbol followed by MSDOS5.00 (or
   something similar). An example is EMSDOS5.0, where the E is a sigma
   character (like the sum button in Microsoft Excel).
<P>
   -or-

<LI>The Microsoft Money 2.0 Setup program may hang at 80% completion and
   display the message:  "Please insert the Microsoft Money Setup Disk."
<P>
   -or-

<LI>The Microsoft Works for Windows version 2.0 Setup program may hang and
   display the message "Cannot Find WIZZY1.LS$" after you insert Disk 4 and
   Disk 4 becomes corrupted.
<P>
</UL>When you run the Microsoft Office Setup from disks, Setup may return one of
the following error messages:

<UL><LI>Insufficient memory to run application. 900K required.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Setup needs 900K of free space.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>There is insufficient memory or disk space to run setup. Setup
   requires at least 900K of free disk space. Try shutting down other
   applications, restarting Windows, or freeing some disk space.
<P>
</UL>The following viruses are known to corrupt not only the computer’s files
but also the application’s setup disks and may cause the errors above.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The problems described above occur if the "Stoned" virus (or one of the
others mentioned above) is present on your computer or has infected your
Microsoft Setup disks.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around these problems use one of the following methods:
<P>
Method 1: Run a vaccination utility for the virus. (To obtain this utility,
<PRE>          contact your local software vendor.) Use an anti-virus program
          with the latest virus signatures to detect and remove the virus.
          Some anti-virus programs include V-Shield and Viruscan by Norton
          Associates (formerly McAfee), Central Point Anti-Virus, Norton 
          AntiVirus, and F-Prot by Command Software. After removing the virus
          from your computer, run setup from uninfected disks.

          When your computer is clean, reinstall the Microsoft application.

</PRE>Method 2: restart your computer using a write-protected emergency boot disk
<PRE>          that was created on an uninfected computer. Use the FDISK and
          FDISK /MBR commands, reformat the hard drive, and reinstall the
          operating system and programs.

</PRE>To obtain replacement disks for Microsoft Office, call Microsoft Order Desk
at (800) 360-7561. International customers should see Microsoft's World
Wide Offices Web site at:
<P>

</PRE>CAUTION: Be sure to check your system for viruses before you reinstall this
or any other software.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has rigorous quality control measures to insure that viruses are
not on disks that we ship. The Setup disks for the applications listed
above are distributed virus-free in sealed clear plastic envelopes that
display a message about the Microsoft software license agreement. If disks
are purchased in any other type of package, they should not be used.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
A computer virus is an executable file designed to replicate itself and
avoid detection. A virus may try to avoid detection by disguising itself as
a legitimate program. Viruses are often rewritten and adjusted so that they
will not be detected. Anti-virus programs must be updated continuously to
look for new and modified viruses. Viruses are the number-one method of
computer vandalism. There are over 5000 known viruses, and new virus
strains continue to show up regularly. The rate of virus infection is also
increasing.
<P>
Shareware versions of some of the anti-virus programs may be downloaded
from various online services.
<P>
The products discussed here are manufactured by vendors independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these
products' performance or reliability.

<P><h3>Microsoft Golf</h3>
