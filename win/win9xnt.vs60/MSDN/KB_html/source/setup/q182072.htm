<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you run the installer program for any of the stand-alone Microsoft
Office 98 Macintosh Edition programs, click Remove to remove the program,
and then attempt to start any of the remaining stand-alone Office 98
programs, you receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   &lt;Office 98 program name&gt; cannot load the Microsoft Office 98 shared
   libraries. There may not be enough free memory to load the libraries
   or files may have been moved from their originally installed locations.

   Try the following:

    - In the Memory Control Panel, make sure Virtual Memory is turned on.
      If you turn it on, restart your computer.

    - Move &lt;Office 98 program name&gt; back to the Microsoft Office 98 folder
      (or the folder where it was originally installed).

    - Reinstall &lt;Office 98 program name&gt; using the installer program
      provided with the software to make sure that all files needed to run
      &lt;Office 98 program name&gt; are installed correctly.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs because the installation program for the stand-alone
program that you have removed also removes files that the other stand-alone
program requires.
<P>
When you run the Installer program for any of the programs listed at the
beginning of this article, and then click Remove, the following message
appears:
<P>
<PRE>   Remove all previously installed components.

   Files that may be used by other applications will not be removed.

</PRE>However, if you click Remove, any Office 98 programs that remain on your
computer do not work.
<P>
The information in the Installer dialog box is incorrect. When you click
Remove in the installer program for any stand-alone Office 98 program,
certain files that are required by the remaining stand-alone Office 98
programs are removed.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, reinstall the affected programs. Because some
of the program files already exist on your computer, run the Installer
program for each affected program instead of performing a drag-and-drop
installation.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you click Remove in the Installer program for one of the stand-alone
Office 98 programs, the icons for other Office 98 programs in the Microsoft
Office 98 folder are not deleted. This gives the impression that the
programs still function. However, several crucial files in the Microsoft
Office 98:Office folder are deleted (by design). The absence of these files
prevents any remaining Office programs from starting.
