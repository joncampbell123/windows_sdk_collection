<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you encounter a problem during the Setup program for your application,
the problem may be characterized by any one of the following symptoms.
<P>
<P><h3>Floppy Disk Drive Problem Symptom</h3>
 
<P>
Setup requests Disk 2 after Disk 2 is inserted
<P>
<PRE>   -or-

</PRE>You receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   "Error reading drive &lt;x&gt;:" error message

   -or-

</PRE>When you restart Microsoft Windows 95 in safe mode and run the Office Setup
program, a blue screen appears with the following message
<P>
<PRE>   Error reading disk in drive a:
   Please insert disk &lt;Diamond Symbol&gt;&lt;Smiley Face symbol&gt; &lt;Serial Number&gt;
   in drive a:

</PRE><h3>Damaged Setup Disks Symptom</h3>
 
<P>
You receive a "Not enough memory" or "Insufficient memory" error message.
<P>
<P><h3>Virus Symptom</h3>
 
<P>
You receive the "Cannot find &lt;file&gt;" error message (where &lt;file&gt; is the
name of a file that should be located on the Setup disk).
<P>
<P><h3>Trouble Reading DMF Disk Symptom</h3>
 
<P>
You receive the following error message
<P>
<PRE>   Could not read from file

</PRE>To troubleshoot the type of error message you are receiving, see the
appropriate section below.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS/TROUBLESHOOTING TECHNIQUES</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Floppy Disk Drive Problem</h3>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1</h3>
 
<P>
If Setup is having trouble reading Disk 2 (Setup keeps requesting Disk 2),
you may need to add the MS-DOS DRIVPARM command to your CONFIG.SYS file. To
do this, place the DRIVPARM command in the CONFIG.SYS with the following
syntax:
<P>
<PRE>   For a 1.44-MB A: drive      For a 1.44-MB B: drive
   --------------------------------------------------

   DRIVPARM=/d:0 /f:7          DRIVPARM=/d:1 /f:7

</PRE>For additional information, please see the following article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>    ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../setup/q119837.htm">Q119837</A></B>
    TITLE     : Setup Program Keeps Requesting Disk 2

</PRE><h3>Method 2</h3>
 
<P>
If you are having problems with a floppy disk drive (such as receiving the
error message "Error reading drive &lt;x&gt;:"), insert another (non-Microsoft
Setup) disk in the floppy disk drive. If you receive an error message
attempting to read this disk, there may be a hardware problem with your
floppy disk drive.
<P>
If you do not receive an error message reading the test floppy disk, there
may be a problem with the Setup disk. For more information, see the
"Damaged Setup Disks" section in this article.

   TITLE     : Troubleshooting Floppy Disk Drive Problems in
               Windows 95

</PRE>If neither of these methods corrects the problem, there may be a hardware
problem with your floppy disk drive: use diagnostic software with your
floppy disk drive and have a qualified hardware technician examine it.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 3</h3>
 
<P>
If you restart Microsoft Windows 95 in safe mode, run the Office Setup
program, and a blue screen appears with the following message
<P>
<PRE>   Error reading disk in drive a:
   Please insert disk &lt;Diamond Symbol&gt;&lt;Smiley Face symbol&gt;
   &lt;Serial Number&gt; in drive a:

</PRE>You may have a damaged Setup disk. To determine whether your disk
is damaged, see the Damaged Setup Disks section in this article.
<P>
<P><h3>DAMAGED SETUP DISKS</h3>
 
<P>
To determine if you have a damaged setup disk, use the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Use a disk utility (such as ScanDisk) to test the disk for damage.
<P>
   NOTE: Do not use a non-Windows 95 aware disk utility on DMF disks.
   Non-Windows 95 aware disk utilities can damage DMF disks. The
   Windows 95 ScanDisk tool recognizes and does not damage DMF disks.
<P>
   Before you run a disk utility, please see the following article in
   the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../win95x/q120442.htm">Q120442</A></B>
<PRE></PRE>      TITLE     : Using Hard Disk Utilities with Windows 95

</PRE><P><LI>Type the following command at an MS-DOS command prompt
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy &lt;drive&gt;\*.* nul
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;drive&gt; is the floppy disk drive you are having problems with.
   For example, if you are having problems with drive A, insert a disk
   you are having problems with in drive A and type the following command:
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy a:\*.* nul
</PRE><P>
   This command copies the files on the disk to a null device. If there
   is a problem copying the files, error messages appear on the screen, and
   there may be a problem with the information on your disk.
<P>
</OL>If the filename on your disk contains extended characters or unreadable
characters, you should check the disk and your computer for a virus (see
the "Virus" section below). The name of the file that is located on Disk 2
and following (Disk 1 contains additional files) should be similar to the
following:
<P>
<PRE>   msoff2.cab

</PRE></OL>If you have determined from either of the above steps that you have a
damaged Setup disk, you will need to order a new set of disks. To obtain
replacement disks, call the Microsoft Order Desk at (800) 360-7561 and
request a replacement set of disks. If you are outside the United States,
contact the Microsoft subsidiary for your area. To locate your subsidiary,
see the Microsoft World Wide Offices Web site at:
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/worldwide/default.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/worldwide/default.htm</A></B>

</PRE><h3>VIRUS</h3>
 
<P>
If you suspect that a virus is present on your computer, scan the hard disk
and floppy disks with a virus detector. If a virus is found on your
computer, remove the virus before you run Setup again. If a virus is found
on your Setup disk, you will need to obtain a new set of disks.
<P>
Microsoft has rigorous quality control measures to insure that viruses are
not on disks that we ship. The Setup disks for the applications listed
above are distributed virus-free in sealed clear plastic envelopes that
display a message about the Microsoft software license agreement. If disks
are purchased in any other type of package, they should not be used.
<P>
The following viruses are known to cause problems when Setup is run from
DMF disks:
<P>
<PRE>   antiEXE
   NOINT
   Junkie
   A-Dign
   B1
   V-Sign
   RIPPER

   TITLE     : Office: Setup Problems May Indicate that System Has Virus

</PRE>If you have determined that you have a Setup disk that has been damaged by
a virus, you can order a new set of disks. To obtain replacement disks,
call the Microsoft Order Desk at (800) 360-7561 and request a replacement
set of disks. If you are outside the United States, contact the Microsoft
subsidiary for your area. To locate your subsidiary, call the Microsoft
International Sales Information Center at (425) 936-8661.
<P>
<P><h3>TROUBLE READING DMF DISK</h3>
 
<P>
If you are having problems only with DMF disks (Setup Disk 1 works fine,
but you have trouble with Setup Disk 2) and you have followed the
appropriate steps in the "Floppy Disk Drive Problem," "Damaged Setup
Disks," and the "Virus" sections above, you may be having trouble reading
DMF disks on your computer. For additional information, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
