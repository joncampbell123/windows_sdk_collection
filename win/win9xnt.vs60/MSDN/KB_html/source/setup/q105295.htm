<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run the Setup program for one of the applications listed above to
install a component of the application that you have not installed
previously, or that you have removed, the following error message appears:
<P>
<PRE>   Could Not Open the File Named ...\SETUP.EXE

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The SETUP.EXE file is not in the path specified in the error message.
<P>
This error message occurs when you have previously installed the
application from a network server using a specific drive letter. The Setup
program writes the location of the drive from which the application was
installed in the SETUP.STF file. For example, if you run the Setup program
from a server installed on drive Z, the Setup program looks to drive Z for
the SETUP.EXE file.
<P>
If you disconnect the server share from the letter Z and reconnect using
the letter W, for example, the Setup program cannot find the SETUP.EXE file
and returns the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Could Not Open the File Named Z:\server\Setup.exe

</PRE>This also occurs if you install the application from a CD-ROM drive and
then remove the CD before you run the Maintenance mode setup.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
If the server drive has been changed (as in the example above), you can
reconnect the server share to the original drive and the Setup program will
run correctly.
<P>
If this is not possible, delete the SETUP.STF file and rerun the Setup
program from the new network drive. The SETUP.STF file is located in the
SETUP subdirectory of the directory in which you installed the application.
When you delete the SETUP.STF file, the Setup program does not run in
maintenance mode, and you must install the application as if it is the
first time you've run the Setup program.
<P>
If your network supports the universal naming convention (UNC), run the
Setup program using UNC names to avoid this problem. When you use UNC
names, the Setup program adds UNC paths in the SETUP.STF file, eliminating
the problem caused by using the specific drive letter, if the drive letter
is not available at later time.
