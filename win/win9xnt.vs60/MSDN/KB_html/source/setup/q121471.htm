<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you install Microsoft Office to a compressed drive, the following
error may occur even if the setup program reports that there is enough
space on the hard drive at the beginning of the installation:
<P>
<PRE>      "Insufficient Hard Drive Space"

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
There are two possible causes for this error message when you are
installing to a compressed drive even though there appears to be ample
disk space:

<UL><LI>Many executable and supporting files are already compressed.
   Compression programs report space available based on a projected
   estimate of the level of compression that can be applied by the
   utility. When these files are saved to the hard drive, they use up
   more space than the compression program anticipates, and the
   installation runs out of hard disk space.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>There is less than 7 megabytes (MB) of uncompressed space on the host
   drive. To increase the amount of space on the  host drive, reduce the
   size of the Windows swap file or consult your drive compression utility
   documentation to reallocate more space to the host drive.
<P>
</UL><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Setting the swap file to NONE in the Windows Control Panel, Enhanced
icon should free hard drive space on the host drive. (This is the fastest
and most direct route to freeing hard drive space on the host drive.)
Temporary Swap Files can be established on the Compressed Volume File which
makes up the logical drive. Be aware that if you have a Temporary Swap
File, setting it to NONE, may not free any disk space on the host drive.
<P>
You should set the Swap File to a smaller number before you try to
reallocate disk space using the compression utility. Many compression
utilities do not support growing the Compressed Volume File, so once you
have reduced the size of the Compressed Volume File, the change might be
permanent.
<P>
To gain more accurate estimates of the free disk space remaining with the
compression, set the estimated compression ratio equal to the Actual
Compression ratio.
