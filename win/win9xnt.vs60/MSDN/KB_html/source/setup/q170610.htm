The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, you should first make a backup copy of the
registry files (System.dat and User.dat). Both are hidden files in the
Windows folder.
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After you install Microsoft Office and work in a program or after you
restart Microsoft Windows, the computer responds slowly or may appear to
stop responding (hang). The pointer may change to an hourglass and hard
disk activity may increase. However, if you wait for a while, the computer
responds at its normal speed.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may occur after you install the Microsoft Office Find Fast
Indexer or if the amount of free disk space is low.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1: Change SlowDown of the Microsoft Office Find Fast Indexer</h3>
 
<P>
To improve the performance of the computer when you use the Find Fast
indexer utility, add the SlowDown value setting in the Microsoft Windows
95 or Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 registry. The SlowDown value tells Find
Fast to delay indexing for a specified amount of time between index
updates. Delaying indexing minimizes system activity and therefore
increases performance.
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall Windows 95. Microsoft cannot guarantee
that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be
solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the Changing Keys
And Values online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Note that
you should make a backup copy of the registry files (System.dat and
user.dat) before you edit the registry.
<P>
To add the SlowDown setting, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Close any programs that are running.

<P><LI>On the Start menu, click Run. Type "regedit" (without the quotation
   marks) and click OK.

<P><LI>In the Registry Editor, expand the following key:
<P>
<P><PRE>      HKey_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Shared Tools\Find Fast\97
</PRE>
<P><LI>On the Edit menu, point to New and click DWORD Value. With New Value
   #1 selected, type "SlowDown" (without the quotation marks), and then
   press ENTER.

<P><LI>With the value SlowDown selected, click Modify on the Edit menu.
   Under Base (In the Edit DWORD Value dialog box), click Decimal. Type a
   value greater than 1,000 (valid values are between 0 and 10,000).
<P>
   NOTE: These values are measured in milliseconds. The implicit default
   value is one second or 1,000 milliseconds.

<P><LI>Click OK and quit the Registry Editor.

<P><LI>Restart Microsoft Windows.
<P>
</OL><h3>Method 2: Check Your Disk Space</h3>
 
<P>
Check to make sure that you have enough disk space available. If you are
running low on disk space, delete any files and folders that you are not
using and empty the Recycle Bin to create more available disk space.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design of the Find Fast Indexer in Microsoft Office 97.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Find Fast Indexer is a utility that builds indexes to speed finding
documents from the Open dialog box in Microsoft Office programs and from
Microsoft Outlook. When you install Microsoft Office, a shortcut to Find
Fast is placed in the Startup program group.
<P>
By default, Find Fast creates a single index on each hard disk on the
computer. You can also create many indexes on a local hard disk and on
drives that are shared or on a network. You can open the Find Fast Control
Panel icon to create additional indexes (for example, on a network drive),
to delete indexes, and to set other options. Although you can configure
Find Fast in the Control Panel, Find Fast indexes documents automatically
through the Open and Advanced dialog boxes in Microsoft Office programs.
<P>
