<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you received a Microsoft application as a competitive upgrade, the
application's Setup program may not recognize files on your hard disk as
being valid for upgrading.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs when the competitive program is located on a disk
drive with NTFS 3.51 compression. This problem occurs because the Setup
program does not recognize the competitive program file on your hard disk
if the drive is compressed using this compression scheme.
<P>
Note that this problem does not occur under Windows 95 on a hard disk that
was compressed using Microsoft DriveSpace. This problem also does not occur
if Setup detects a registry entry for the competitive program.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To continue installing the Microsoft program when the Setup program does
not recognize that you have a valid program for upgrading on your computer,
insert Disk 1 of the Setup disks for the competitive program in your floppy
disk drive. The Microsoft application's Setup program will detect the
competitive program on the floppy disk, and will allow you to continue
running Setup.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If you own certain word processors, spreadsheets, presentation graphics
packages, or database programs, you may qualify for purchasing a Microsoft
application as a competitive upgrade. When you install the competitive
upgrade program, the compliance checker program searches your computer for
a qualifying program, or asks you to insert a disk that contains a
competitive program file.
