<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run the Setup program, the Online Registration button may not
appear in the Setup maintenance mode dialog box or in the "Setup was
completed successfully" dialog box.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs when you run setup again in maintenance mode after
successfully completing Setup and registering the application. The first
time you run Setup, you receive a dialog box with the following information
after Setup is complete
<P>
<PRE>   &lt;Microsoft Application&gt; Setup was completed successfully.

   If you have a modem, you can now click the "Online Registration" button
   to register your new software with Microsoft via modem.

</PRE>where &lt;Microsoft Application&gt; is the application that you are installing,
such as Microsoft Office for Windows 95. If you click Online Registration,
the Registration Wizard dialog box appears and allows you to register your
application. If you do not register your application the first time you run
Setup, the Online Registration button appears in the Setup maintenance mode
dialog box (along with the maintenance mode installation options) when you
run Setup again. Note that when you run Setup in maintenance mode, the
Online Registration button does not appear in the "Setup was completed
successfully" dialog box.
<P>
However, if you have successfully registered your application, this Online
Registration button does not appear in any of the dialog boxes when you run
Setup. The registration button may also not appear if the file (Regwiz.exe)
supplied by Windows 95 is missing from the Windows\System folder.
