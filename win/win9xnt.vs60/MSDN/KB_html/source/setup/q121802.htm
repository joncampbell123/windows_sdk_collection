<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run the Setup program in maintenance mode for one of the
applications listed above, the Setup program fails to remove or add the
requested item, and you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Could not read from the file named a:\word2.cab

   Word2.cab cannot be decompressed and may be corrupted

</PRE>Note that the error message that you receive may contain a different
filename such as:
<P>
<PRE>   Could not read from the file named b:\msoff13.cab

   -or-

   Could not read from the file named c:\msoffice\clipart\off42art.thm

</PRE>Alternate error messages include:
<P>
<PRE>   Unable to read from disk - retry

   The compressed file b:\msoff13.cab cannot be decompressed and may be
   corrupted.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs when you run Setup from the hard disk drive, either by
choosing Office Setup And Uninstall from the Microsoft Office Manager (MOM)
toolbar or by double-clicking the Setup icon in Program Manager, or by
double-clicking the SETUP.EXE file in the applications Setup directory.
<P>
This problem occurs because the Setup program cannot read the distribution
media format (DMF) disks when you run Setup in maintenance mode from the
hard drive. The problem is that Setup either loads the DMF enabling code,
or doesn't load this code based on whether the source drive, or the drive
from which you run Setup is removable media or not. When you run Setup in
maintenance mode from your hard drive, the DMF enabling code never gets
loaded, and Setup cannot read the DMF disk.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, run Setup from Disk 1 of your Setup disks. As
long as the setup table file (SETUP.STF) is registered correctly in the [MS
Setup (ACME) Table Files] section of your WIN.INI file, the maintenance
mode of Setup runs fine and the DMF enabling code is loaded properly.
<P>
