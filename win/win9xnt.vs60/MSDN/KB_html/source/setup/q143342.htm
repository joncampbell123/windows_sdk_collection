The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for Windows 95, version 7.0
<LI>Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows 95, version 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run the Setup program for Microsoft Office for Windows 95, if you
choose the Run From Network Server option, some Word templates and
PowerPoint add-in files are copied to your local workstation.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs when you run the Microsoft Office Setup program from a
network server (after the administrative installation was performed) and
click the Run From Network Server option. This behavior is incorrect. The
Setup program should use existing templates and add-in files on the server
rather than copy the files locally.
<P>
The following table lists the files that should be accessed from the
server, but are copied locally instead.
<P>
<PRE>Folder                        File name
</PRE> 
<P>
Msoffice\Powerpnt
<P>
<PRE>                              Geniwiz.ppa
                              Pptools1.ppa
                              Ppttools.ppa

</PRE>Msoffice\Winword
<P>
<PRE>                              Email.dot
                              Email1.dot
                              Email2.dot
                              Email3.dot

</PRE><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
You can work around this problem if you run the Setup program on the
workstation, remove all the components, and then use the Network
Installation Wizard (NIW) that is included in the "Microsoft Office for
Windows 95 Resource Kit" to modify the Setup.stf file on the server. After
you modify the Setup.stf file, you must reinstall Office to each
workstation. To do this, use the following steps:
<P>
WARNING: This modification may not be supported by Microsoft Product
Support Services (PSS). PSS will support some modifications to a BACKUP
copy of the Setup.stf file. Note also that while PSS may help customers
modify specific lines of an STF, we will not rewrite the entire file in
order to achieve a desired configuration. As a general rule, support is
limited to options that can normally be changed by a user during a standard
installation of the application.

<OL><P><LI>Run the Setup program on each workstation that has Microsoft Office
   installed and click Remove All.

<P><LI>Delete the files in the following local folders on the workstation:
<P>
   Msoffice\Powerpnt
<P>
<P><PRE>      Geniwiz.ppa
      Pptools1.ppa
</PRE><P>
   Msoffice\Winword
<P>
<P><PRE>      Email.dot
      Email1.dot
      Email2.dot
      Email3.dot
</PRE><P>
   Note that the Msoffice folder may have a different name if you did not
   originally accept the default name during Setup.

<P><LI>Copy the Setup.stf file that is on the server and name it Setup.bak.

<P><LI>Start the Network Installation Wizard, and when prompted, select the
   Setup.stf file that is on the server.

<P><LI>When the option appears, click Run From Server, and click Set Office
   Options.

<P><LI>Click Minimize Footprint Of PowerPoint Wizards, click Edit Selection,
   click Yes, and then click OK.

<P><LI>Click Minimize Footprint Of WordMail Templates, click Edit Selection,
   click Yes, and then click OK.

<P><LI>Click OK, click Next, and then click Finish.
<P>
</OL>By default, the NIW creates a modified version of the Setup.stf file called
Newsetup.stf. In order for the Office Setup program to use this modified
version of the .stf file, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Copy the Setup.exe file on the server and give the copy the same name
   (except for the .exe extension) as the modified .stf file.
<P>
   For example, if your modified .stf file is called Newsetup.stf, then
   name the copy of the Setup.exe file to Newsetup.exe.

<P><LI>Connect to the server from the workstation and run the renamed version
   of the Setup file.
<P>
   For example, if you want the Setup program to use the modified .stf
   file, Newsetup.stf, then run the file on the server called Newsetup.exe.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: If you click Cancel in the Network Installation Wizard before you
finish modifying the .stf file, and you already have a modified version of
the .stf file in the folder (directory) on the server, the Network
Installation Wizard deletes the modified .stf file, Newsetup.stf. Also, be
sure to make a backup copy of the original .stf file before you start the
Network Installation Wizard.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you perform a Run From Network Server installation, the main Office
program files are left on the server and run remotely while some files
are copied to the local workstation by design. The templates and files
listed previously in this article should not be copied locally.
<P>
The Network Installation Wizard allows you to modify the Microsoft Office
for Windows 95 Setup information files to create a customized network
installation of Microsoft Office.
<P>
Microsoft Office for Windows 95 has an option called WordMail that allows
Microsoft Exchange version 4.0, 32-bit Windows clients to use Microsoft
Word as the default e-mail editor. If WordMail is installed, Word becomes
the e-mail editor by default.
<P>
When you use Word as your e-mail editor, you can use a Word template as the
basis for a message. To use a Word template, click WordMail Options on the
Compose menu in Microsoft Exchange, click Add, select the template, and
click Add again. To use the templates on the server, add them in the
WordMail Options dialog box. When you add a template, a shortcut that is
linked to the template is created in the Msoffice\Winword\Wordmail folder.
