The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Setup for the Macintosh, version 1.0
<LI>Microsoft Office for the Macintosh, version 4.2.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you install Microsoft Office version 4.2.1, over an existing
installation of Microsoft Office version 4.2, and you attempt to use Setup
to modify your installation, you may receive unexpected results.
<P>
This situation also occurs with Mode 1 and Mode 2 administrative
installations.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
For best results, remove version 4.2 before you attempt to install version
4.2.1. You should also remove earlier Mode 1 and Mode 2 installations
before you attempt an administrative installation of version 4.2.1. (Not
only will this method of installation provide you with more available disk
space, but the Setup program will not be installed over an existing
administrative installation.)
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you install an application using Microsoft Office Setup, the Setup
program keeps track of everything it installs on the disk, and writes file
locations for shared application components (OLE servers, and so on) to the
registry. Both the applications and the Microsoft Office Manager (MOM) use
this registry information to determine what is available. If you install
Microsoft Office version 4.2.1 over Microsoft Office version 4.2, the
registry information may not correspond with what is actually installed
on your hard disk drive. Any files that are common to version 4.2.1 AND
version 4.2 installations will be double-counted in the registry. When you
try to remove these components using Setup, they are not removed.
<P>
Although Setup overwrites the old version 4.2 table file with the version
4.2.1 table file, the registry entry still points to that file location as
containing the Office 4.2 setup table file (STF). If you run MOM and choose
Setup And Uninstall, you see two Office choices listed: Office 4.2.1 and
Office 4.2 for the Power Macintosh. Choosing either one starts Office 4.2.1
Setup in maintenance mode. In this scenario, it is possible to accidentally
remove Office 4.2.1 applications when you intend to remove Office 4.2
applications.
<P>
If you did a more complete installation of Microsoft Office version 4.2
than you did of Microsoft Office version 4.2.1, the applications installed
with version 4.2.1 may behave unpredictably.
