<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After installing Internet Explorer 3.0 from distributable files created by
the Internet Explorer Administration Kit (IEAK) in the ISP Wizard mode,
dialup scripting on Windows 95 may not be installed or may not function
properly.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
During the setup and installation of Internet Explorer 3.0, if the
Smmscrpt.dll file is present in your Windows\System directory, Setup
assumes that dialup scripting is currently installed and fully functioning.
If the scripting engine is properly installed, the script is associated,
and works normally. However, if dialup scripting has been removed through
the Add/Remove Programs Control Panel, and this file is present (or if the
scripting engine is not functioning properly), the script may not be run
when the dialup connection is used.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, remove the Smmscrpt.dll file from the
Windows\System directory before running the IEAK Wizard.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This problem has only been reported to be a problem on computers that are
used for testing purposes. A common method used when testing Internet
distributable files is to remove the installed Internet programs and
related components (such as dialup scripting) by means of the Add/Remove
Programs Control Panel. When dialup scripting is removed in this way, it
leaves the Smmscrpt.dll file in the Windows\System directory, but removes
other supporting files. Subsequent installations of an Internet Explorer
distribution file skip installing the dialup scripting components, due the
presence of the Smmscrpt.dll file in the Windows\System directory.
<P>
Removing this file causes dialup scripting to be installed when using
Internet Explorer distributable files created using the IEAK in the ISP
mode.
