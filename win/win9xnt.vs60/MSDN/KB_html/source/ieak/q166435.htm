The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Internet Explorer Administration Kit version 3.2a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you attempt to use the /T switch when you install a program using a 
self-extracting executable file that was created using Internet Express, 
the installation program's temporary folder may not be created in the 
location in which you intended. The temporary folder may be created in 
one of the following locations instead:

<UL><LI>If a temporary folder already exists in Windows 95 or Windows NT, the 
   installation program's temporary folder may be created in the existing
   Windows temporary folder.

<LI>If a temporary folder does not already exist in Windows 95 or Windows 
   NT, the installation program's temporary folder may be created in the 
   folder from which the installation program was run.
<P>
</UL>This problem is known to occur with the Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0 
versions of Microsoft Internet Explorer, Microsoft Internet Mail and News,
Microsoft NetMeeting, Microsoft Comic Chat, Microsoft Chat, and Microsoft 
Personal Web Server. However, the problem also occurs with any other 
program that is installed using a self-extracting executable file created 
using Internet Express.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when you do not specify the full path to the 
installation program's temporary folder.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To prevent this problem from occurring, specify the full path to the 
installation program's temporary folder when you use the /T switch to 
install a program. For example, if you want the installation program to 
use the Temp folder on drive D as its temporary folder, use the following
syntax
<P>
<PRE>   &lt;program&gt; /t:d:\temp

</PRE>where &lt;program&gt; is the self-extracting executable file associated with 
the installation program.
