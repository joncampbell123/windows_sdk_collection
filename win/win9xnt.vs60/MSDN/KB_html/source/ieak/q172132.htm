The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Internet Explorer Administration Kit, version 3.2a
</UL> 
IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Because there are options that Internet Explorer Administration Kit (IEAK)
does not support or does not expose, you may need to use a Registry file to
configure Internet Explorer.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor
can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.
<P>
You can add a Registry file a custom command-line option that is
executed at the end of setup. This allows custom settings to be made to
Internet Explorer that the IEAK does not expose or support.
<P>
To add a Registry file to a customized build of Internet Explorer, you must
do the following two things:

<OL><P><LI>You must add the Registry file to the IEAK custom file. This allows the
   Registry file to be added to the custom directory prior to running the
   IEAK wizard. In the IEAK wizard, specify this directory when you are
   prompted to enter the location of the custom files.

<P><LI>You must add the Registry file as a custom command-line option to be
   executed at the end of setup. To do this, type the name of the Registry
   file in the place provided in the IEAK wizard. In order for the Registry
   file to be executed properly it must have a .reg extension, and the .reg
   extension must be associated with Regedit.exe.
<P>
<P>
</OL>When the Registry file is executed at the end of setup, the system will
prompt that a change has been made to the Registry. At this point, click
OK, and the system should prompt to be rebooted.
<P>
Sample Registry File That Turns Off the Cache in Internet Explorer:
<P>
<PRE>   REGEDIT4

   [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Main]
   "Enable_Disk_Cache"="no"
</PRE></OL> 
<PRE>Version           : WINDOWS:3.2a
Platform          : WINDOWS
Issue type        : kbhowto</PRE>
