The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual InterDev, version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Data appears to be deleted, overwritten, or out of sync when the Data Form
Wizard is used to create form-like pages using Active Server Pages (ASP).
This occurs when Internet Explorer (IE) has two different browser windows.
You can create an additional browser window by clicking New Window on the
File menu.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
For pages created using the Data Form Wizard, one recordset variable is
used in each session of Internet Explorer, not each Window (see the MORE
INFORMATION section).
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
The easiest solution is to not create another Window using the New Window
command, but rather another instance of Internet Explorer by double-
clicking its icon to launch another copy.
<P>
A new Window could be rendered inoperable programmatically by implementing
a mechanism of semaphores, which allows only one window to be modifying the
recordset during a session.
<P>
Another option is to redesign the output code in such a way that it uses
multiple recordset variables for each session, which is an expensive
solution in terms of performance (memory and computational hit on the
server).
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed
at the beginning of this article. We are researching this bug and will post
new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
<P>

<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Users connect to the Web site, go to the page created with the Data Form
   Wizard, and select list view. (This view shows a brief summary of
   approximately 10 records at a time.)

<P><LI>The user decides to open up a new browser window so they can get two
   things done at once. In Internet Explorer, they go to the File menu, and
   click New Window.

<P><LI>In the original window, they see a record they want to edit--let's say
   BOB--and they click on the BOB record to edit it in detail form.

<P><LI>In the new window, they decide they want to edit the record JANE, and
   they click on the JANE record to edit it in detail form.

<P><LI>In the original window, they change the name from BOB to ROBERT and
   click Update to update the data in the database.
<P>
</OL>If the users go back to the list view (see step 1), they see that BOB's
record name didn't change, but JANE's record name changed to ROBERT,
corrupting the data in the database.
