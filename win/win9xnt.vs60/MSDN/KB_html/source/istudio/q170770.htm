The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual InterDev, version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Certain ActiveX Controls do not function properly when used in Visual
InterDev. This is not the fault of Visual InterDev itself, but instead is a
problem with the controls.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The problems occur when an ActiveX Control lacks a crucial interface, or
fails to implement an interface properly. Although this behavior has been
seen in some third-party vendor controls, it is more likely to occur in
"high school project" controls that the user unwittingly picks up while
navigating the Web. A list of "known problem" controls appears in the MORE
INFORMATION section below (it includes controls that have since been
"fixed," since old copies of the controls may still exist).
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
The only workaround is to avoid using defective controls. Major third-party
vendors have been informed about buggy controls, and have been pretty good
at getting new versions out. Contact the vendor to obtain updated versions
of the controls.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>

<P>
</UL><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 
<P>
Steps vary from control to control.  Here is a summary of the problems and
how or when they are encountered:
<P>
BEHAVIOR: GPF in Forms3 when inserting control
REASON: Forms3 crashes when IControls::Add() is called, due to lack of
interface support by the control.
HANDLING: Obviously bad, but can only be fixed in either the controls
themselves or Forms3.
AFFECTED CONTROLS: SchGridCtrl Object, daVinci Diagram Surface Control,
daVinci Polyline Comb Control
Additional notes: SchGridCtl has massive internal exception problems,
ASSERTing a lot in Msscul00.dll before the GPF.
<P>
BEHAVIOR: GPF in Richtx32.ocx when closing object editor
REASON: Control is trying to access a NULL pointer during persistence.
HANDLING: None possible--needs to fixed in the control.
AFFECTED CONTROLS: RichEdit Control, version 4.0, RichEdit Control, version
5.0.
Additional notes: Version 4.0 control also lacks type info support, and
ASSERTS in support.cpp.
<P>
BEHAVIOR: Editor cannot be dismissed after launching browser from it in
design-time
REASON: The control is refusing to transition to an inactive state.
HANDLING: None possible--needs to be fixed in the control.
AFFECTED CONTROLS: RealAudio(tm) ActiveX Control (32-bit) Object
Additional notes: Killing MSDEV is the only way to get out of this!
<P>
BEHAVIOR: Couldn't insert for unknown reasons internal to the control
REASON: IControls::Add() returned FAILED(hr), with the HR code indicating
that the proper interfaces were not supported by the control
HANDLING: Graceful. We currently pop-up a message box telling the user that
the control couldn't be added.
AFFECTED CONTROLS: DaVinci Polyline Control
<P>
BEHAVIOR: Can insert, but cannot persist (just get)
REASON: Control does not support an IPersist format usable by HTMOP.
HANDLING: Graceful. We currently pop-up a message box telling the user that
the control will not persist.
AFFECTED CONTROLS: Apex Data Bound Control, DBGrid Control.
<P>
BEHAVIOR: Cannot insert control for known reason internal to the control
REASON: GetTypeInfoOfGuid fails on these controls.
HANDLING: Pretty good. The ASSERT in Support.cpp is superfluous and should
be removed, as the error handling is already smart enough to deal with this
correctly.
AFFECTED CONTROLS: Data Connection Control, Microsoft Shell Item Control,
Common Dialog Control, version 5.0, ImageList Control, version 5.0,
ListView Control, version 5.0, ProgressBar Control, version 5.0, Slider
Control, version 5.0, StatusBar Control, version 5.0, TabStrip Control,
version 5.0, Toolbar Control, version 5.0, TreeView Control, version 5.0.
<P>
BEHAVIOR: ASSERT in ide\pkgs\htm\support.cpp, but OK if ignored.
REASON: GetTypeInfoOfGuid fails on these controls.
HANDLING: None--needs to be fixed in the control.
AFFECTED CONTROLS: DBCombo Control, version 4.0, DBList Control, version
4.0, MAPI Messages Control, version 1.0, MAPI Session Control, version 4.0
Masked Edit Control, version 4.0, MCI Control, version 4.0, MSComm Control,
version 4.0, Picture Clip Control, version 4.0.
<P>
BEHAVIOR: ASSERT in ide\shell\proppage.cpp, but OK if ignored.
REASON: The number of counted array elements returned by the control is
zero, but the element pointer returned is not NULL.
HANDLING: None--needs to be fixed in the control.
AFFECTED CONTROLS: Lead Std Control, Macromedia Active Shockwave
<P>
BEHAVIOR: ASSERT in CClientDC constructor
REASON: The control is passing a CWnd with a NULL hwnd to the CClientDC
constructor
HANDLING: None--needs to be fixed in the control.
AFFECTED CONTROLS: OGLDemo Control
Additional notes: This control seems to be a "work in progress": its
property page has a "TODO" comment on it.
<P>
BEHAVIOR: ASSERTS in MSSCUL00.DLL, ASSERT in parse.cxx line 2890
REASON: The controls have internal problems regarding exception handling.
The parser ASSERT comes from a failure to save the stream, although text
does appear in the document. Whether it's correct or not is unclear.
HANDLING: None--needs to be fixed in control.
AFFECTED CONTROLS: WebLabelCtl Object, WTextCtl Object
<P>
BEHAVIOR: ASSERTS in Fm20.dll, memory leaks, no design-time rendering
REASON: The control has internal problem regarding instantiation and
rendering.
HANDLING: None--needs to be fixed in the control.
AFFECTED CONTROLS: Sysmon Graph Control
<P>
BEHAVIOR: User breakpoint hit in Ntdll.dll while debugging
REASON: Unknown; occurs only while using IDE debugger on an NT machine
HANDLING: N/A.
AFFECTED CONTROLS: Label Control
Additional notes: Works fine in debug version outside of the debugger &amp; in
retail. In debugger, just hit F5 and keep going.
<P>
BEHAVIOR: ASSERT in Cmdtarg.cpp, line 52 (destructor for CCmdTarget), but
OK if ignored
REASON: Ref count is off by one
HANDLING: None--this is a flaky problem that shouldn't be handled.
AFFECTED CONTROLS: Common Dialogs Control, Crystal Report Control, Grid
Control, PICS Date Edit Control
Additional notes: Only seen if a previously added control caused problems--
hard to reproduce.
<P>
BEHAVIOR: "Enter" doesn't do default behavior
REASON: Internal to control
HANDLING: None.
AFFECTED CONTROLS: ImageList Control
Additional notes: Using the "space" bar works fine.
<P>
BEHAVIOR: Controls show up poorly sized or zero-sized, but can be resized
REASON: "By design" in the controls, apparently
HANDLING: None. Would need to be handled in Forms3 ("if size.cy == 0 ...",
for example), as controls could always be added from the Forms3 toolbox, or
(better yet) in the controls themselves.
AFFECTED CONTROLS: ActiveX Plugin Object, MarqueeCtl Object, PopupMenu
Object, RealAudio(tm) ActiveX Control (32-bit) Object.
<P>
BEHAVIOR: Property page is blank or incomplete
REASON: "By design" in the controls, apparently
HANDLING: None.
AFFECTED CONTROLS: Active Earth Time, Farallon Look@Me Control.
<P>
BEHAVIOR: Bad tab order, properties button doesn't work.
REASON: Internal to controls.
HANDLING: None.
AFFECTED CONTROLS: ActiveMovie Control Object
<P>
BEHAVIOR: Layout tab gives error first time.
REASON: Internal to control, apparently.
HANDLING: None.
AFFECTED CONTROLS: DynamiCube.
<P>
BEHAVIOR: Eats CPU, constantly repaints, can't resize.
REASON: Internal to control, apparently--design-time code should be
rewritten.
HANDLING: None.
AFFECTED CONTROLS: ViewTracker Object.
<P>
BEHAVIOR: Repaints only on a resize.
REASON: Internal to control.
HANDLING: None.
AFFECTED CONTROLS: Virtual World.
<P>
BEHAVIOR: ASSERT in CBindHost code when drag-copying control
REASON: The control is trying to create a moniker with a NULL URL
HANDLING: None--needs to be fixed in control.
AFFECTED CONTROLS: RealAudio(tm) ActiveX Control (32-bit) Object
