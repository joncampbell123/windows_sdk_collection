The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual InterDev, version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
With Visual InterDev, you can have your entire Web development team working
on Web files that are tested on the staging server. After you are confident
the versions of the files are ready to move to the production server, you
can copy the Web site from the staging server to the production server.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
For small sites, you can copy the updated files to the production server
using the Web Copy command.
<P>
Use the following steps to copy the development Web site to the production
Web site:

<OL><P><LI>Make sure that the team has added any new files to the Web project and
   saved the files to the staging Web server. If your team is using Visual
   Source Safe, make sure all of the files are checked in and release all
   working copies to the Web staging server.

<P><LI>Make sure that the database access settings for the production server
   are the same access settings on the staging server.
<P>
   NOTE: To make database access easier, use File DSNs rather than System
   DSNs to connect to the database. You should do this because the System
   DSN uses only the DSN name in the script generated by Visual InterDev in
   the Global.asa file. The rest of the information is retrieved from the
   registry based on the name. In contrast, if you select a file DSN, all
   the connection information in the .dsn file is copied into the script
   that Visual InterDev generates in the Global.asa file. Because the
   connection information has been copied into the script, you no longer
   need the original .dsn file in order to connect to the database server,
   and the connection information travels with the Web site wherever it
   goes. (See HELP Keyword: "file DSNs described," Topic: "Using ODBC
   System DSN &amp; File DSN).

<P><LI>In File View, select the directory for the project files you want to
   copy. You can do this at any directory level you need.

<P><LI>From the Project menu, select Copy Web, and copy the Web site to the
   production server.

<P><LI>If you want to copy only the files that are new or updated, select the
   Copy Changed Files Only option.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: The security settings for the copied files are inherited from the
root project on the production server. If you want the security settings to
be unique, the Web administrator needs to change the security settings for
the files on the production server.
<P>
For large sites, or commercial sites where you want more control over
updating and propagating files, review the information about Microsoft
Commercial Internet System at
