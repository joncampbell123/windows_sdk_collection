</UL><h2>Removing Beta versions of Visual InterDev or Internet Studio components</h2>
 
<P>
If you have installed any pre-release versions of Microsoft Visual InterDev
(formerly known as Internet Studio) or any of the components that are
included with Visual InterDev such as the FrontPage Server Extensions or
Active Server Pages, you must remove them. This will help to ensure that
the released versions of these components will be correctly installed.
<P>
NOTE: For the most recent updates to these instructions, please visit the
Visual InterDev Web site at <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/vinterdev">http://www.microsoft.com/vinterdev.</A></B>
<P>
To remove all Beta versions of Visual InterDev or Internet Studio:

<OL><P><LI>Double-click the Add/Remove Programs icon in Control Panel, and then
   remove the Beta client software, labeled "Microsoft Internet Studio" or
   "Microsoft Visual InterDev".

<P><LI>Restart your computer.

<P><LI>Remove all the Beta components in the same way. This includes Microsoft
   Active Server Pages, Microsoft FrontPage 97 Server Extensions, and a
   beta-only component, the Microsoft Internet Studio Server.

<P><LI>After the last item has been removed, or when asked, restart your
   computer.

<P><LI>Find your Beta software directory, either:
<P>
<P><PRE>      X:\Program Files\DevStudio\Istudio
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      -or-
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      X:\Program Files\DevStudio\VInterDev
</PRE><P>
<P>
   where X is the hard drive where you have Windows installed.

<P><LI>Now that you have uninstalled the Beta software, back up any data files
   in these directories and then delete the Beta software directories. You
   can remove these Beta directories only if you have already uninstalled
   the Internet Studio or Visual InterDev Beta using the Add/Remove
   Programs icon in Control Panel.

<P><LI>Remove several Beta registry keys from your system that were added by
   the Beta.
<P>
   NOTE: If you prefer an automated method of updating the registry, you
   can download a program from <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/vinterdev">http://www.microsoft.com/vinterdev</A></B> that will
   safely remove these keys for you.
<P>
   Be very careful when deleting registry entries: deleting the wrong
   entries can prevent Windows from restarting. If necessary, you can
   restore the registry by following the instructions in the "Restoring the
   Registry" section of the Registry Editor Help system. Before rebooting,
   be sure to read these instructions in case the system is not restored
   correctly and does not respond.
<P>
   To remove the registry keys from the Beta:
<P>
   A. Click the Start button and choose Run.
<P>
   B. Type regedit.
<P>
   C. Navigate in the left pane to each of the following locations, select
<P><PRE>      the specified folder in the left pane, and then press Delete. If you
      can't find a folder, skip it. For example, to delete the first key,
      navigate to:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>         HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Devstudio\5.0\Html

      Then, click the HTML folder, and press Delete. Note Do not delete any
      of the preceding folders, such as "5.0" or "Devstudio."

      Delete the following registry folders:

       - HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Devstudio\5.0\Html
       - HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\DevStudio\5.0\IstudioProject
       - HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\FrontPage (Internet Studio
         Edition)
       - HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\FrontPage (Visual InterDev
         Edition)
       - HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\FrontPage (Visual Studio
         Edition)
       - HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\DevStudio\5.0\Products
         \Microsoft Visual InterDev
       - HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\DevStudio\5.0\Products\
         Microsoft Internet Studio

</PRE><P><LI>Close the registry editor.

<P><LI>Continue by installing the released version of Visual InterDev.
<P>
</OL>If you still have problems with the server pieces on Windows NT and you
have had a Beta version on your computer
<P>
Many install issues can be traced to files with improper version stamps,
which can be a by-product of Beta versions. Improper version stamps can
prevent a file from getting uninstalled and overwritten when reinstalling,
leaving your computer in a less-than-optimal or even a non-working state.
In almost every case, uninstalling the Microsoft Internet Information
Server and then Internet Explorer will reduce your computer to a generic
state from which to rebuild. Previous Beta testers should consider the
steps below only if the above steps do not work and you are familiar with
the Windows NT operating system.

<UL><LI>Use the Add/Remove Programs icon in the Control Panel:
<P>
   1. Uninstall Microsoft Internet Information Server.
<P>
   2. Uninstall Microsoft Internet Explorer.
<P>
   3. Uninstall Microsoft FrontPage.
<P>
   4. Uninstall any Visual Studio (DevStudio) client programs (including
<P><PRE>      Visual InterDev)
</PRE>
<LI>Delete the Bin directories manually:
<P>
</UL>NOTE: You should attempt to delete files and directories manually only
after you try to uninstall using the Add/Remove programs icon in the
Control Panel.
<P>
The Bin directories are usually installed in the \Program Files directory
as Microsoft FrontPage\Bin, Microsoft FrontPage\Servsupp, and DevStudio.
Back up any personal data files in these directories.

<UL><LI>After deleting the Bin directories:
<P>
   1. Reinstall Microsoft Internet Information Server.
<P>
   2. Reinstall Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.01 or later.
<P>
   3. Reinstall all the Visual InterDev server pieces again.
<P>
   4. Reinstall the client pieces if the client will be run on the same
<P><PRE>      computer as the server components.
</PRE><P>
</UL>Installing Windows NT Workstation Peer Web Services After Installing Visual
InterDev
<P>
This installation order will install incorrect ODBC files. To correct this
problem, rerun the Active Server Pages item in the Visual InterDev Master
Setup dialog box.
<P>
<P><h2>Installing the Oracle ODBC driver</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Visual InterDev includes a new, recommended Oracle(R) ODBC driver
written by Microsoft that you can install for use with Microsoft Visual
InterDev. The Oracle ODBC driver is not included with the typical install.
<P>
To install the Oracle ODBC driver:

<OL><P><LI>In the Master Setup dialog box, choose Custom.

<P><LI>Choose ODBC.

<P><LI>Select the Oracle driver.
<P>
</OL>-or-

<OL><P><LI>Insert the Microsoft Visual InterDev CD-ROM in your CD-ROM drive, and go
   to the \Server\Oracle directory.

<P><LI>Launch the Setup program in this directory.
<P>
</OL>Note that this driver should be installed on any Web server computers from
which you want to access Oracle databases. Note also that the Oracle driver
requires SQL*NET 2.3 or later to run properly. You can obtain this software
from Oracle Corporation.
<P>
<P><h2>Installing the SQL Server Service Pack 2</h2>
 
<P>
If you plan to use Visual InterDev with SQL Server 6.5, you will need to
first install Service Pack 2 in order to fix some problems that prevent the
Visual InterDev database tools from running properly. Service Pack 2 is
included on the Visual InterDev CD ROM.
<P>
To install the SQL Server Service Pack 2:

<OL><P><LI>Insert the Microsoft Visual InterDev CD-ROM into the CD-ROM drive on the
   computer that is running SQL Server 6.5, and go to the \Server\SQLSrvSp
   directory.

<P><LI>Launch Setup.exe.
<P>
</OL><h2>RISC versions of Visual InterDev Server components are available</h2>
 
<P>
Dec Alpha and Power PC versions of the FrontPage Extensions are available
on: <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/frontpage">http://www.Microsoft.com/FrontPage.</A></B>
<P>
Dec Alpha and Power PC versions of the Active Server Pages component are
available on: <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/iis">http://www.Microsoft.com/IIS.</A></B>
<P>
<P><h2>Upgrading from FrontPage Personal Web Servers</h2>
 
<P>
If you installed Microsoft FrontPage on Windows 95, you might have
installed the Front Page Personal Web Server instead of the Microsoft
Personal Web Server. In order to use Active Server Pages with Visual
InterDev, you need to install the Microsoft Personal Web Server that ships
with Visual InterDev.
<P>
If you attempt to install the Microsoft Personal Web Server that comes with
Visual InterDev on a computer that already has the Front Page Personal Web
Server, you can get the following error when you click Personal Web Server
on the Visual InterDev Master Setup dialog box:
<P>
"An older version of Microsoft Personal Web Server was found on your
machine. You must uninstall the existing version before setup can
continue."
<P>
If you have this configuration on your computer, see
<B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/frontpage/upgrade/engupgrade.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/frontpage/upgrade/engupgrade.htm</A></B> for step-by-step
instructions on how to migrate your content to the new Microsoft Personal
Web Server for Windows 95, or for information on how to make both Web
servers co-exist on the same system.
<P>
<P><h2>Special Notes and Known Problems</h2>
 

<UL><LI>Trouble setting permissions back to root Web permissions using dialog
   box
<LI>Trouble using design-time controls or accessing events in Global.asa
   when using unique permissions on Web
<LI>Missing DLL in Design-Time Control SDK

<LI>Problems fixing links with DBCS files
<LI>FrontPage Server and international content
<LI>Personal Web Server international installation issues
<P>
</UL><h2>Trouble setting permissions back to root Web permissions using dialog box</h2>
 
<P>
If you use the Web Permission item on the Project menu to display the Web
Permission dialog box to grant unique permissions for your Web (as opposed
to using the same permissions as the root Web), you won't be able to use
the dialog box to change the unique permissions back to match the root Web.
If you select the option "Use Same Permissions as Root Web" in the Web
Permission dialog box and click OK, nothing will happen.
<P>
To grant the same permissions as the root Web to your project, use the Copy
Web command on the Project menu to copy the content of your Web to a new
project on the same server. This copies your content but sets your
permissions to be the same as the root Web.
<P>
Trouble using design-time controls or accessing events in Global.asa when
<P><h2>using unique permissions on Web</h2>
 
<P>
If you use the Web Permission command on the Project menu to display the
Web Permission dialog box, and then select the Use Unique Permissions for
this Web option to secure your Web site, the events in your Global.asa file
will not execute when users browse your Web. This causes any design-time
controls used on your site to stop working properly, because they depend on
state that gets set in these events.
<P>
This problem occurs because this setting of the Web Permission dialog box
removes read permissions for the anonymous user from the Global.asa file,
and Active Server Pages requires read permissions for the anonymous user in
the Global.asa file in order to process this page.
<P>
To give read permissions for the Global.asa file to the anonymous user,
follow these steps on Windows NT:

<OL><P><LI>Find the Global.asa file for your project under the WWWRoot directory on
   your Windows NT Web server.

<P><LI>Right-click this file, and choose Properties.

<P><LI>On the Security tab, click Permissions.

<P><LI>In the File Permissions dialog box, click Add, and then type the name of
   your anonymous user in the Add Names box. Make sure the Type of Access
   box has Read selected and click OK.
<P>
</OL>For example, if the anonymous user is named "IUSR_MYMACHINE" and your
server is named "MyMachine" you would type "MyMachine\IUSR_MYMACHINE" in
the box.
<P>
NOTE: To determine the name of the anonymous user of your Windows NT Web
server, run the Internet Service Manager (from the Microsoft Internet
Server group on the Windows NT Start Menu), and then double-click the WWW
service for your computer. The name of the anonymous user is listed in the
Anonymous Logon section of the dialog box that appears.
<P>
<P><h2>Missing DLL in Design-Time Control SDK</h2>
 
<P>
If you install the Design-Time Control SDK from the
\Client\VIntDev\Misc\SDK directory on the Visual InterDev CD ROM, and then
try to insert any of the sample controls that get installed into a Web
page, Visual InterDev might stop. The install program for this SDK does not
properly put one of the required DLLs into the Windows path.
<P>
To correct the problem, copy the file Vbiserv.dll from Samples\Vb\Common
(where you installed the SDK) into your Windows\System directory, or put
the SDK Samples\Vb\Common\ directory on your Windows path.
<P>
<P><h2>Problems setting ActiveMovie control properties</h2>
 
<P>
If you use the ActiveMovie control in HTML pages or ActiveX Layout pages,
you might experience problems setting properties in the Properties window.
This is a known problem with the ActiveMovie control.
<P>
<P><h2>Running out of virtual memory on the Web server</h2>
 
<P>
After creating many new Webs on your Web server, you might get a warning
that your server is running low on virtual memory. This is not a problem in
normal usage, and will only affect servers where many new Webs are being
created without ever stopping and starting the Web server. You can work
around this problem by increasing the amount of virtual memory you have
available on your Web server computer, and also by periodically stopping
and starting the server if you are creating many new Webs.
<P>
<P><h2>Problems dragging and dropping in Windows 95</h2>
 
<P>
If you installed a previous version of the Microsoft Personal Web Server,
included in the public Beta of FrontPage 97 and previously available for
download from www.microsoft.com, you might experience problems dragging and
dropping. That version of the Personal Web Server was designed to run only
on a newer version of Windows 95 shipped by computer manufacturers.
<P>
Although the version of the Microsoft Personal Web Server on the Visual
InterDev CD-ROM no longer has this problem, installing it will not fix the
problem if you installed the previous version. A fix for this problem is
available on the Visual InterDev CD-ROM. You should install this fix if
you've previously installed versions of Microsoft Personal Web Server from
sources other than the Visual InterDev CD-ROM.
<P>
To install the fix:

<OL><P><LI>Insert the Microsoft Visual InterDev CD-ROM in your CD-ROM drive, and go
   to the \Server\PWS\PWSPatch directory.

<P><LI>Read the Readme.txt file in that directory.

<P><LI>Run Pwsfix1.exe.
<P>
</OL><h2>Large Web pages on Microsoft Windows 95b</h2>
 
<P>
If you are running the 'b' version of Microsoft Windows 95 (also known as
OS R2), there is a known problem with the version of the Personal Web
Server that is included with that platform. If you create a Visual InterDev
project on your Windows 95b Web server and add any pages that are bigger
than 4K you will get an error: " HTTP Error 500, cannot connect to server."
You can correct this problem by installing the version of Personal Web
Server that is included with Microsoft Visual InterDev. To install:

<OL><P><LI>Remove the existing version of the Personal Web Server by double-
   clicking the Network icon in Control Panel, choosing Personal Web
   Server, and clicking Remove.

<P><LI>Install the version of Personal Web Server from the Visual InterDev
   Master Setup dialog box.
<P>
</OL>Detecting required fields in Microsoft Access databases with the Data Form
Wizard
 
<P>
There is a known problem with the Microsoft Access ODBC driver that
prevents the Data Form Wizard from correctly determining which fields need
to be included in the data form in order to properly update records. This
means that the fields displayed in the Data Form Wizard as required might
not be, and that some fields that are not marked as required might actually
be required. To work around this problem, use Microsoft Access to check
which fields in your database are actually required before launching the
wizard, and ensure that you've included them in your data form.
<P>
<P><h2>Problems accessing a page that uses Microsoft Access query and linked table</h2>
 
<P>
You might experience Web server problems if you are trying to run a
Microsoft Access Query that uses a linked table on a Web page. Microsoft
Access queries with linked tables on Web pages are not supported with the
version of the Microsoft Access ODBC driver that is included with Visual
InterDev. This problem occurs only on a Web page since it allows multiple
users to access the database and causes threading issues with the Microsoft
Access ODBC driver. This problem will not occur with applications that do
not use multiple threads against the Microsoft Access ODBC driver.
<P>
<P><h2>Printing a link view</h2>
 
<P>
You can print a link view on any printer that supports raster graphics.
<P>
By default, your link view is printed at the current zoom level. If you
want to enlarge or reduce your link view, select a different zoom setting.
<P>
The icons and links that appear in your link view will print exactly as
shown on the screen with one exception: objects that are selected in your
link view do not appear in their selected state in your printout. If you
want to include icon labels in your printout, make sure they are visible in
your link view. Labels appear at zoom levels higher than 40%.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>Data Range Footer navigation buttons realigned after automatic link fixup</h2>
 
<P>
If you have automatic link fixup in your project turned on (the default is
off) and link fixup corrects links in a file that contains a Data Range
Footer Design-Time control, the file is modified so that the navigation
buttons in the footer are aligned vertically instead of horizontally. To
fix this problem, open the file with the problem, right-click the Data
Range Footer, choose Edit Design-Time Control, and then immediately close
the Object editor that is opened. This causes the Data Range Footer control
to automatically replace its output with the correct output.
<P>
For information about automatic link fixup, see the next item.
<P>
<P><h2>Turning on automatic link fixup in Visual InterDev projects</h2>
 
<P>
When you move or rename a file in a Visual InterDev project, Visual
InterDev can automatically fix any links that referred to this file so that
they point to the new file name or location. This useful feature can save
you a lot of time fixing broken links. However, this feature is turned off
by default since it has two side-effects that some users dislike. If link
fixup is turned on, the process of fixing up links also reformats the white
space in pages that are affected, according to an algorithm that tries to
make the pages look reasonable. However, this changes the original
formatting in the page. In addition, this process might automatically add
tags that the link fixup engine believes are missing, even though the tags
aren't missing, just embedded in script. In pages that contain server-side
script, this can sometimes result in errors when the page is viewed in a
browser.
<P>
If you want to turn on link fixup so that Visual InterDev automatically
fixes links to files when they are moved, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the File menu, click Open, and then open your project.

<P><LI>In FileView, right-click the project node and click Properties.

<P><LI>On the General Tab, set Link Repair to On.
<P>
</OL>This feature is stored on a per-project basis, so you will need to turn it
on in all the projects whose links you want to be automatically fixed.
<P>
<P><h2>Using aggregate functions with queries in the Data Form Wizard</h2>
 
<P>
If the Data Form Wizard cannot determine the result columns in your query,
check that you're not using aggregate functions (for example, Count or Sum)
in the SQL statement you supplied to the wizard. To use aggregate functions
with the Data Form Wizard, you must use a SQL alias in order for the data
form to generate proper references for the query.
<P>
For example, the following Group By query:
<P>
<PRE>   Select city, Count(population) From state Group By city

</PRE></OL>would need to be changed to:
<P>
<PRE>   Select city, Count(population) as Persons From state Group By city

</PRE><h2>Problems filtering with the Data Form Wizard against fixed-length fields</h2>
 
<P>
If you use the filter mode of the pages created by the Data Form Wizard,
you need to specify a wildcard character ("%") after data you want to
filter on if that data is contained in a fixed-length character field in
the database. This is because Active Data Objects (ADO) pads the field with
spaces up to the field width. For example, if you want to search for all
entries called "Cars" in a fixed-length field of eight characters, the
filtering tries to compare "Cars" with "Cars " which doesn't match. In this
example, the workaround would be to specify "like 'Cars%'" as the search
criteria.
<P>
<P><h2>Problems saving Oracle stored procedures</h2>
 
<P>
This problem happens only if you try to save twice after creating an Oracle
stored procedure without closing the editing window after the first save.
When you create an Oracle stored procedure, Visual InterDev adds the
following line as part of the default text of your stored procedure:
<P>
<PRE>   Create /*OR REPLACE*/....

</PRE>The "OR REPLACE" part of the line is commented out to prevent users from
accidentally overwriting stored procedures with the same name that already
exist on the system. However, after you save the procedure once, you need
to remove the comment characters in this line if you want to save again
before closing. Otherwise, you will get an error that says "Can't save
because this object already exists" when you try to save for the second
time. If you close and reopen the stored procedure, the comment characters
surrounding "OR REPLACE" are automatically removed.
<P>
<P><h2>Special information on active server pages on double byte character systems</h2>
 
<P>
There are some known problems with double-byte character sets (used in Far
East systems) and the version of Active Server Pages shipping in Version
1.0 of Visual InterDev. A new version of Active Server Pages that has these
problems fixed will be posted on the Web very soon after Visual InterDev is
available in stores. To get the new version when it is available, visit the
Visual InterDev Web site at <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/vinterdev">http://www.microsoft.com/vinterdev.</A></B> Information
on how to download the fixed version will be posted there.
<P>
The following is a list of known DBCS issues:

<UL><LI>DBCS Project names return "HTTP/ 1.0 404 object not found" when used
   with the Personal Web Server on Windows 95
<P>
</UL>If you name a Web created with Visual InterDev using DBCS characters, and
you are creating this Web on the Personal Web Server for Windows 95, you
will get the error "HTTP/ 1.0 404 object not found" when trying to access
any pages in the Web. If you name your Web using SBCS (single byte
character system) characters, you will be able to access pages, even if the
pages themselves use DBCS names. In addition, if you create the Web on a
server on Windows NT, you will also be able to access the pages. This
problem occurs only on the Personal Web Server on Windows 95.

<UL><LI>DBCS named query string elements or form elements always return an empty
   value from Request.QueryString() method
<P>
</UL>If you pass variables from page to page using an HTTP query string or HTML
form element, and either type of variable is named using DBCS characters,
when you try to access them using the Request.QueryString() method in
server script, you might get an empty string instead of the actual value of
the variable. The workaround is to name your HTTP query string variables or
form elements using SBCS characters.

<UL><LI>Extra characters might be returned when using Request.QueryString() and
   Request.Cookies() methods with DBCS data
<P>
</UL>If you pass variables from page to page using an HTTP query string or HTML
form elements, and either type of variable is passing data that contains
DBCS characters, extra characters might be appended to the end of the data
when it is retrieved using the Request.QueryString() method in server
script. This can occur even if the name of the element is SBCS. It is the
DBCS data, not the name, that causes the problem in this case. The
workaround is to pass only SBCS data from page to page using cookies, form
elements, or query strings.

<UL><LI>Using PATH_INFO and PATH_TRANSLATED values with Request.ServerVariable()
   method might return extra characters
<P>
</UL>If you use the Server.ServerVariable() method and pass it values of
PATH_INFO or PATH_TRANSLATED, the value returned might have extra
characters on the end of the path if any part of the path has DBCS
characters in it. The workaround is to use only SBCS names for Web names,
path names, and file names.

<UL><LI>Server.MapPath() method might return extra characters when used with
   DBCS path
<P>
</UL>If you call the Server.MapPath() method any DBCS characters in the path,
extra characters might get appended onto the end of the value returned by
the method. The workaround is to use only SBCS names for Web names, path
names, and file names.
<P>
<P><h2>Problems fixing links with DBCS files</h2>
 
<P>
If you name a file using double-byte characters and then move or rename it,
files with HTML links to this file will not be automatically fixed to point
to the new location. To work around this problem, name your files using
SBCS (single byte character set) characters instead.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>FrontPage Server and international content</h2>
 
<P>
For the FrontPage97 Server Extensions to work properly with international
Web content, the Web server on which the extensions are installed must have
code pages installed for each language used by the content stored on that
server. For example, if you store Japanese documents on a US English Web
server and wish to view and author those Japanese documents using
FrontPage97, then the Web server computer must have the Japanese code pages
installed.
<P>
Several language packs are available on the Visual InterDev CD ROM so that
you can add the appropriate code pages to your server. Look in the
\Server\LangPack directory on the Visual InterDev CD ROM to find the
language packs and a Readme file that describes how to use them.
<P>
<P><h2>Personal Web Server international installation issues</h2>
 
<P>
The Visual InterDev master setup prevents users from installing a language
version of the Personal Web server that does not match the language of the
operating system. If you are running a non-English Windows 95 and would
like to install Personal Web Server, please download your language version
from the Microsoft Web site.
<P>
This check was implemented because of a problem with the Win95 file
Rpcrt4.dll that Personal Web Server installs. There are three versions of
Rpcrt4.dll with different base addresses shipping across the different
language versions of Windows 95. Overwriting an existing Rpcrt4.dll with an
incorrect base address version of this file will cause your Windows 95
installation to become unstable.
<P>
If there is no Personal Web Server version for your language available,
please check with your local Microsoft Technical Support for the proper
Personal Web Server installation process for your language.
