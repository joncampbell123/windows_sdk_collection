<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes the functionality and use of navigation bars in
Navigation view in Microsoft FrontPage 98.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The navigation bar is a graphical or textual page element that incorporates
navigation hyperlinks to pages that are part of a FrontPage Web. Navigation bars
are created automatically when you create a FrontPage Web by using a wizard or
by creating a navigational structure in Navigation view in FrontPage Explorer.
<P>
The navigation bar works in conjunction with Navigation view in FrontPage
Explorer. This allows FrontPage to automatically regenerate navigation bars
every time you change the structure of your Web.
<P>
Navigation view allows you to create a hierarchical structure proceeding from
the home page to any or all pages in your FrontPage Web. Navigation view also
allows you to see and alter this structure of links from any page in your Web.
<P>
While the navigation bar properties may look the same on each page throughout
the Web, the actual navigation bar generated by FrontPage will be unique to the
individual page on which it appears.
<P>
The exact links generated by the navigation bar are determined by the relative
position of the current page in relation to the remainder of the navigational
structure. These relative links are referred to by the terms Parent Level, Same
Level, Back and Next, Child Level, Top Level, Home Page, and Parent Page.
<P>
<P><h3>Parent Level</h3>
 
<P>
This option will create links to all pages connected by a horizontal line at the
level of the Navigation view immediately above the current page. Links will not
be created for pages not connected by a horizontal line at the level immediately
above the current page.
<P>
<P><h3>Same Level</h3>
 
<P>
This option will create links to all pages connected by a horizontal line to the
current page. Pages not connected to the current page by a horizontal line will
not be included.
<P>
<P><h3>Back and Next</h3>
 
<P>
This option will create either one or two links to the files connected by a
horizontal line to the left of the current page (back) and/or to the right of
the current page (next). Pages all the way on the left end of a level in the
structure will be connected by a Next link, while pages all the way on the right
of the structure will be connected by a Back link. Links will not be created for
pages if no other files are immediately adjacent and connected by a horizontal
line.
<P>
<P><h3>Child Level</h3>
 
<P>
This option will create links to all pages connected by a horizontal line at the
level of the navigational structure immediately below the current page. Links
will not be created on pages that are not connected by a horizontal line at the
level below the current page.
<P>
<P><h3>Top Level</h3>
 
<P>
The home page or any page that is present in the navigational structure, which
is not connected by a line from another page, is considered a top-level page. A
top-level page always includes the home page. However, it will also include any
pages present in Navigation view that are not connected to other pages by means
of a horizontal or vertical line.
<P>
<P><h3>Home Page</h3>
 
<P>
This option is not relative to the location of the current page in the
navigational structure. It will always generate a link to the home page of your
FrontPage Web.
<P>
<P><h3>Parent page</h3>
 
<P>
This option will create a link to the individual file directly above the current
page and connected by a vertical line in Navigation view.
<P>

FrontPage Help, type the following text

topic.

For information about inserting a navigation bar on a page that has no peer
pages, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : FP98: Navigation Bars Do Not Appear on the Home Page

</PRE>If a navigation bar is inserted on a page that does not use themes it will
appear as text. When you apply a theme, the graphical appearance of the
navigation bar will be defined by the theme. All built-in themes behave this
way. If you do not see a navigational structure in Navigation view when you
create your navigation bar, then your navigation bar will appear as text even if
you then apply a theme. For additional information about themes, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../frontpg/q174857.htm">Q174857</A></B>
   TITLE     : FP98: What Are Themes?

</PRE>Inserting the navigation bar within a shared border region allows you to add,
modify, or delete navigation bars across your web site easily. For additional
information, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../frontpg/q173435.htm">Q173435</A></B>
   TITLE     : FP98: What are Shared Borders and How to Enable, Disable Them

</PRE>When you insert a navigation bar in the main body of a FrontPage Web outside of
the shared border region of your page, you can successfully create a navigation
bar that does not share the same properties as the navigation bar used in the
rest of the FrontPage Web. While this works well for FrontPage-based extended
Web servers, the navigation bar outside of the shared border region will not
appear correctly when you publish to a server where the FrontPage 1.1 or 97
Server Extensions are installed. For additional information, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
