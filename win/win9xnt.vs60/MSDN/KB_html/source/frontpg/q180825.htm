<PRE>                                 SUMMARY
                                 =======

</PRE>You can add Microsoft Visual Basic Scripting Edition (VBScript) or JavaScript
code to a Web page by using the Script Wizard.  This article presents an
overview of how to use the Script Wizard with Microsoft FrontPage.
<P>
<PRE>                             MORE INFORMATION
                             ================

</PRE>The Script Wizard lets you select objects and associated events, and pick an
action that will occur when an event takes place.  After you make your
selections, the Script Wizard creates the VBScript or JavaScript for you.
<P>
NOTE: Before you can use the Script Wizard in FrontPage 97, you must install
Microsoft Internet Explorer version 3.01 or later. You do not need to install
Internet Explorer to use the Script Wizard in FrontPage 98.
<P>
<P><h2>Running the Script Wizard</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>FrontPage 98</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>In FrontPage Editor, open the Web page that contains the object you
   want to script.
<P>
   NOTE: The pointer can be positioned anywhere on the page because the Script
   Wizard automatically inserts the script at the proper place.

<P><LI>On the Insert menu, point to Advanced, and click Script.

<P><LI>In the Script dialog box, click Script Wizard.
<P>
</OL>If you have an ActiveX Control on your page, you can right-click the control and
then click Script Wizard on the menu that appears.
<P>
<P><h3>FrontPage 97</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>In FrontPage Editor, open the Web page that contains the object you
   want to script.
<P>
   NOTE: The pointer can be positioned anywhere on the page because the Script
   Wizard automatically inserts the script at the proper place.

<P><LI>On the Insert menu, click Script.

<P><LI>In the Script dialog box, click Script Wizard.
<P>
</OL>If you have an ActiveX Control on your page, you can right-click the control and
then click Script Wizard on the menu that appears.
<P>
<P><h2>Components of the Script Wizard</h2>
 
<P>
The Script Wizard is divided into three panes:

<UL><LI>Event pane
<LI>Action pane
<LI>Script pane
<P>
</UL><h3>The Event Pane</h3>
 
<P>
The Event pane provides a hierarchical view of all of the objects and events on
your page. It includes ActiveX Controls and HyperText Markup Language (HTML)
forms.
<P>
<P><h3>The Action Pane</h3>
 
<P>
The Action pane provides a hierarchical view of the actions and properties you
can use in the event handler, as well as the global variables and procedures
defined for the page.  When you double-click an action, the Script Wizard adds
that action to the list in the Script pane.  When you double-click a property, a
dialog box asking you to select a value for the property will appear.  The type
of dialog box that you will see, and the values that you can select will vary,
depending on the type of property you double-clicked.  After you have specified
a value for a property, the Script Wizard will add that property to the list in
the Script pane.
<P>
<P><h3>The Script Pane</h3>
 
<P>
The Script pane has two views: List view and Code view. You can switch between
views by clicking the appropriate option at the bottom of the Script Wizard
window.
<P>
You can use List view to assign simple actions to events or to set property
values by using a point-and-click approach. If you want to use the power and
full support of the scripting language, you can use Code view to write VBScript
or JavaScript code.
<P>
Using the Script Wizard in List View:
<P>
If you script multiple actions for any given event, the actions will be executed
in the order they appear in the list in the Script pane. You can use the Move Up
and Move Down buttons to reorder the actions in the list.
<P>
To reorder the actions in the list, you can either insert or delete an action:

<UL><LI>Click Insert Action. This will add the action that is selected in
   the Action pane to the list in the Script pane.
<P>
</UL>-or-

<UL><LI>Click Delete Action. This will remove the action that is selected
   in the Script pane.
<P>
   NOTE: If you specified a property, you can edit it by selecting the
   property in the Script pane and then clicking Modify Value.
<P>
</UL>Using the Script Wizard in Code View:
<P>
The Script pane displays the actual script in the default scripting language--
VBScript or JavaScript--that you specified for the page. Click anywhere in the
Script pane to edit your script.
<P>
<P><h2>Common Use for the Script Wizard</h2>
 
<P>
Following are some common uses for the Script Wizard.
<P>
<P><h3>Scripting to Link to Another Page</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>In the Event pane of the Script Wizard, expand the object you want
   to script by clicking the plus sign (+) next to the object you want to
   script. When the hierarchy expands you will see all of the events for
   that specific object.

<P><LI>Click the event you want to use as the source of your link. For example,
   select Click or onClick (depending on the type of object you selected).

<P><LI>In the Action pane, double-click the Go To Page action. Do either of
   the following:
<P>
   - If you are working in List view, the Go To Page dialog box will appear.
<P><PRE>     Type the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the destination page, and
     then click OK.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>     -or-
</PRE><P>
   - If you are working in Code view, click in the Script pane and type
<P><PRE>     the URL of the destination page for the window.location.href = ""
     property.
</PRE><P>
</OL><h3>Scripting to Hide or Show a Control</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>In the Event pane of the Script Wizard, expand the object you want
