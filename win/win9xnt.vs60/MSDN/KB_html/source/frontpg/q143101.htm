<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If the FrontPage Server Extensions are not available on the target Web server,
you can still use FrontPage to develop your Web pages. For example, you can
develop the Web by using the Microsoft Personal Web Server on your computer and
then transfering your Web content to the target Web server. Keep in mind that
when you do this, you may lose some features or experience some
incompatibilities between your working server and the target server. This
article discusses features to avoid if you are publishing your content to a
server on which you have not installed the FrontPage Server Extensions and how
to handle these incompatibilities.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If your Web server and operating system are compatible with the FrontPage Server
Extensions, ask your service provider to install them. If the FrontPage Server
Extensions do not currently support your Web server and operating system, you
can submit a suggestion asking Microsoft to provide extensions for your server.
Microsoft welcomes suggestions or comments about changes in functionality and
product design. You are invited to submit suggestions by filling out the form at
the following Microsoft Web site:
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/regwiz/regwiz.asp">http://www.microsoft.com/regwiz/regwiz.asp</A></B>

</PRE>NOTE: To determine whether your server and operating system are compatible with
the FrontPage Server Extensions, please see the following Microsoft World Wide
Web site:
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/frontpage/softlib/current.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/frontpage/softlib/current.htm</A></B>

</PRE><h3>Avoiding FrontPage Browse-Time Components</h3>
 
<P>
Most FrontPage components affect the Web only at authoring time. For example, an
Include Page component or Table of Contents affects the page it is on only when
that page or some other page is created or modified. These FrontPage components
are inactive at browse-time. However, some FrontPage components, especially
those that are used with forms, rely on the FrontPage Server Extensions at
browse-time. If you are transferring your files to a Web server on which the
FrontPage Server Extensions are not installed, you should avoid using the
following FrontPage components:
<P>
<PRE>   Confirmation Field
   Discussion Form Handler
   Registration Form Handler
   Save Results Form Handler
   Scheduled Image
   Scheduled Include Page component
   Search Form

</PRE>If you use any of these FrontPage components, customers who browse your Web site
will receive an "HTTP 404" error when they use the corresponding form.
<P>
<P><h3>Avoiding FrontPage Image Maps in FrontPage 1.0</h3>
 
<P>
Image maps created with FrontPage 1.0 rely on the FrontPage Server
Extensions at browse-time. To avoid problems at browse-time, you should use the
image map utility that is supported by your Web server.
<P>
FrontPage 1.1 is capable of generating both client-side image maps and
native image maps for several server types. For more information about this
feature, click Web Settings on the Tools menu in FrontPage Explorer, and then
click the Advanced tab. When a browser is capable of using a client-side image
map, it will use this instead of a server-side image map.
<P>
<P><h3>Avoiding Server Incompatibilities</h3>
 
<P>
If possible, develop your content on the same type of Web server that you are
using as your target Web server. If this is not possible, avoid
incompatibilities between your working server and your target server. Some
potential trouble areas include the following:
<P>
Access Control:
<P>
Access control will not carry over between Web servers of different
types. You will have to re-enter any access control information for the
new server.
<P>
File Name Extensions:
<P>
Different Web servers may have different rules for mapping file
name extensions to Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) types.
For example, a Windows-based server may recognize only .htm as HyperText
Markup Language (HTML), while a UNIX-based server may recognize only .html.
<P>
NOTE: You can reconfigure your working server to match the target server.
The FrontPage wizards and templates generate pages that have the .htm
extension. If possible, you should make sure that your target server
recognizes the .htm extension for HTML files.
<P>
Default Pages:
<P>
Different Web servers have different conventions for naming the default
page. For example, the CERN server recognizes Welcome.html (among
others) by default, while NCSA 1.4 recognizes Index.html. Note that you
can reconfigure your working server to match the target server. FrontPage
will create the home page document with whatever name the working
server provides. For more information about configuring the default home page
for the FrontPage Personal Web Server, please see the following article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : FP: How to Use a Document Other Than Index.htm as
               Default Page

</PRE><h3>Transferring the Content</h3>
 
<P>
Once your content has been developed and tested on your working server,
you can copy or transfer the files via File Transfer Protocol (FTP) to the
target server. The following files and folders should not be transferred:
<P>
All folders beginning with _vti_:
<P>
These folders contain information for use only when the FrontPage
Server Extensions are present.
<P>
Access Control Files:
<P>
These files vary depending on the type of Web server. In general, you
should remove all files that begin with a period if you are transferring
files to a UNIX server, and you should remove all files that begin with
the hash (#) if you are moving files to a Windows-based server.
<P>
NOTE: If you are using FrontPage 1.1, you can obtain the Microsoft Web
Publishing Wizard to automate the FTP process. It will warn you if your Web
contains files that will not work on a server that does not have the FrontPage
Server extensions. And, it will copy only the files that do work to the
destination server. You can download the Web Publishing Wizard from the
following Microsoft World Wide Web site:

have the FrontPage Server Extensions installed, please see the following
