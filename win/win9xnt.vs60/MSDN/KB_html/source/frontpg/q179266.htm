The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FrontPage 98 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft FrontPage 97 for Windows with Bonus Pack
<LI>Microsoft FrontPage for Windows, version 1.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you open or create a new FrontPage Web in FrontPage Explorer,
the following message appears
<P>
<PRE>   No server on port &lt;port number&gt; at &lt;server name&gt;.

</PRE>where &lt;port number&gt; is the number of the port you are connected to 
(the default port is 80) and &lt;server name&gt; is the name of the server.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
You may receive this error message if any of the following cases:
<P>
<PRE>Case 1:   The Microsoft Personal Web Server is not running. Or, it is
          running on the port that is specified by the error message.

Case 2:   The specified server does not exist, is not running, or does
          not have a Web server running on the port that issued the error
          message.

Case 3:   The FrontPage Server Extensions are not installed on the FrontPage
          Personal Web Server.

Case 4:   You are using a laptop computer and the Windows 95 power conversion
          option is turned on. When the Power Manager is turned on, it
          broadcasts a "shut down" message to all hardware devices. When the
          Network Device Interface Specification (NDIS) device receives the
          broadcast, it shuts down the network card, essentially indicating
          that the card has been removed. TCP/IP is also notified and the TCP/IP
          stack is removed. Once the power conservation mode is done, the
          Personal Web Server, generates a bind to port error message even
          though it is running normally.

</PRE><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Case 1</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>On the Windows Start menu, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

<P><LI>Double-click the Personal Web Server icon.

<P><LI>Click the Startup tab.

<P><LI>Click Start.

<P><LI>Click to select the "Show the Web server icon on the task bar" check box.

<P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
   NOTE: To confirm that the Personal Web Server is running, check to see if the
   Personal Web Server icon appears in the System tray (located at the opposite
   end of the Windows Task bar from the Start menu. 
<P>
</OL><h3>Case 2</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Verify that you typed the correct Web server name.

<P><LI>Verify that you are connected to the Internet if you are attempting
   to connect to a remote server. Check any of the following that apply:
<P>
<P><PRE>    a. If you are connected to the Internet, make sure that the Web
       server is up and the HTTP service is running.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       For information about how to test the connection between your computer
       and the Web server, follow the steps in the "More Information" section
       of this article.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    b. If you are connected to a proxy server, make sure that it is
       configured correctly for FrontPage Explorer. To do this, click Options
       on the Tools menu. In the Options dialog box, click Proxies. If you do
       not know what proxy settings you need to use, contact your Network
       Administrator.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    c. If you are connected to a proxy server and you are accessing a
       server behind a firewall, make sure that you have specified that
       this server is on the Intranet. To do this, follow these steps:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>        1) On the Tools menu, click Options.

        2) In the Options dialog box, click Proxies. 

        3) In the "List of Hosts without Proxy," type the name of the server. If
           the server is located on a port other than port 80, type a colon and
           the port number after the servername, so that it looks similar to
           this:

              servername:8080

</PRE></OL><h3>Case 3</h3>
 
<P>
FrontPage Personal Web server will not start automatically if the FrontPage 
Server Extensions are not installed. To install the FrontPage Server Extensions, 
follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Windows Start menu, point to Find, and then click Files Or Folders.

<P><LI>In the Named box, type "Fpsrvwin.exe" (without the quotation marks). In the
   Look In list, select the hard disk on which you installed FrontPage. Click
   Find Now.

<P><LI>In the list of files found, double-click Fpsrvwin.exe.

<P><LI>In the FrontPage Server Administrator, click Install.

<P><LI>In the Server Type list, click FrontPage Personal Web Server. Click OK.

<P><LI>In the Server Configuration dialog box, click Browse. 

<P><LI>Select the \FrontPage Webs\Server\Conf\httpd.cnf file and click Open.

<P><LI>Type a Username and Password and then click OK.
<P>
</OL><h3>Case 4</h3>
 
<P>
To work around this behavior if you are using FrontPage on a laptop computer, 
use any of the following methods:

<UL><LI>Connect the laptop computer to AC power. 
<P>
</UL>-or-

<UL><LI>Do not allow the laptop to remain idle for a long period of time.
<P>
</UL>-or-

<UL><LI>Disable the Windows 95 power conservation option by following these steps:
<P>
   1. Right-click the My Computer icon, and click Properties on the menu that
<P><PRE>      appears.
</PRE><P>
   2. Click the Device Manager tab.
<P>
   3. Expand the System Devices option by clicking the plus sign next to it.
<P>
   4. Double-click Advanced Power Management Support.
<P>
<P><PRE>      If you do not see an Advanced Power Management item, your
      computer does not support this feature.
</PRE><P>
   5. Click Settings.
<P>
   6. Click to clear the Enable Power Management check box.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
There are some diagnostic tools to determine whether your computer can
communicate via TCP/IP to the server that you are attempting to access.
<P>
PING is an example of a low level utility that will let you know if your
computer and the server can communicate with each other and how long it takes 
information to travel from one computer to the next. To use PING, follow these 
steps:

<OL><P><LI>Connect to the Internet.

<P><LI>On the Windows Start menu, point to Programs, and then click MS-DOS Prompt.

<P><LI>At the command prompt, type the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ping www.microsoft.com
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: You must be connected to the Internet in order to ping
   Microsoft.com. This will not work if you are behind a firewall.

<P><LI>If you receive either of the following messages, you will need to check
   your TCP/IP stack or contact your Internet Service Provider for
   assistance. 
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Destination host unreachable.
</PRE><P>
   -or-
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Request timed out.
