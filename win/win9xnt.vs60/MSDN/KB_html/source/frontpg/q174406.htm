The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FrontPage 98 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft FrontPage 98 supports sending form results in e-mail. To
accomplish this, you must configure your form to send results to e-mail and
the FrontPage Server Extensions to deliver the e-mail to an e-mail
transport. This article describes how to set up FrontPage 98 forms for
e-mail.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Defining Your Form</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>In FrontPage Editor, right-click the form (inside the dash border)
   and then click Form Properties on the menu that appears.

<P><LI>In the E-mail Address box, type your e-mail address.

<P><LI>Click OK.

<P><LI>Save the form by clicking Save on the File menu.
<P>
</OL><h3>Setting up Your E-mail Transport</h3>
 
<P>
To send form results to an e-mail host, the FrontPage Server Extensions
require a Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) server. The FrontPage 98
Server Extensions do not support any other form of e-mail server software.
<P>
To send e-mail from the Web server, configure the FrontPage Server Extensions
in the Frontpg.ini file on the server to deliver the mail to an e-mail
transport. To do this, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Windows Start menu, point to Programs, point to Accessories, and
   then click Notepad.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Open.

<P><LI>Select the Frontpg.ini file and then click Open.
<P>
   This file is typically located in the \Windows or \Winnt folder.

<P><LI>Locate the [FrontPage 3.0] section and then enter the parameter you want
   to configure your e-mail transport, using the following syntax:
<P>
   NOTE: For a list of the supported parameters, please see the "Parameters"
   section of this article.
<P>
<P><PRE>      Parameter=value
</PRE><P>
   The correct syntax for UNIX is:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Parameter:value
</PRE><P>
   This should be set in the configuration file Wexxxx.cnf where x stands for
   the TCP/IP port on which the Web server is running.
<P>
<P><PRE>      /usr/local/frontpage
</PRE>
<P><LI>Save and close the file.
<P>
</OL><h3>Parameters</h3>
 
<P>
FrontPage 98 supports five parameters (configurations) for e-mail transport:

<UL><LI>SMTPHost
<P>
   This parameter should be set to the name or IP address of a host running
   an SMTP server or daemon, such as SendMail on UNIX. When a user submits
   a form whose results are to be sent via e-mail, the FrontPage Server
   Extensions connect to the SMTP server to deliver the mail. By default,
   FrontPage assumes the server is listening to port 25 (the standard for
   SMTP) but you can override this by appending the port number to the name.
   The name and port number are separated by a colon, like this:
<P>
<P><PRE>      name:xx
</PRE><P>
   where xx represents the port number.
<P>
   The following are examples of a parameter=value setting:
<P>
<P><PRE>      SMTPHost=mail.example.microsoft.com
      SMTPHost=127.0.0.1
</PRE><P>
   The following is an example of a parameter:value setting:
<P>
<P><PRE>      SMTPHost:test:1000
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - SendMailCommand
</PRE><P>
   This parameter should be set to the name of a program on the server
   computer to which e-mail should be piped. Typically, this will be
   SendMail on UNIX, but it could be any program. When the FrontPage Server
   Extensions receive a form processed as an e-mail message, the Server
   Extensions invoke the command, replacing all occurrences of "%r" with
   the recipient of the mail. The per cent sign character followed by any
   other character is replaced by the recipient's e-mail address. The mail
   message is passed to the command as standard input. If both
   SendMailCommand and SMTPHost are set, SendMailCommand takes
   priority.
<P>
   Following is an example of the SendMailCommand parameter:
<P>
<P><PRE>      SendmailCommand:/usr/lib/sendmail %r
</PRE>
<LI>MailSender
<P>
   This parameter should be set to the sender's user name. Specifically, it
   is used as the argument for the "SEND FROM:" command in SMTP. The default
   for SMTP is "user@host" (without the quotation marks), where "user" is the
   current user account and "host" is the current host name.

<LI>MailCharSet
<P>
   This parameter can be used to override the character set attribute of
   the content-type header.

<LI>MailEncoding
<P>
   This parameter can be used to override the content transfer encoding
   attribute of the content-type header.
<P>
</UL><h3>Possible Error Messages</h3>
 
<P>
If the SMTP host is present when the form is created, but the SMTP host
is later removed (and the form has not changed since then), you will
receive the following error on a default page returned by the form when the
form is submitted:
<P>
<PRE>   FrontPage Error.

   User: Please report details to this site's webmaster.
   Webmaster: Please see the server's application event log for more
   details.

</PRE></OL>If SMTPHost is not present when the form is created, you will receive the
following error message from FrontPage:
<P>
<PRE>   The FrontPage Server Extensions have not been configured to send e-mail.
   Please direct your system administrator or Internet Service Provider to
   follow the instructions at "Setting Up Your E-Mail Transport" in the
   \SERK\enu\Admin.htm file on the FrontPage CD-ROM.

   Would you like to remove the e-mail recipient?  (Yes or No)

</PRE>NOTE: This error message is received if e-mail is not configured when the
form is created.
<P>
If you choose not to remove the e-mail recipient and the extensions are not
configured correctly, then when the form is filled out and submitted, the
form will be refreshed, but without a background image (if there was one)
and the Address line in your browser will change from this:
<P>
<PRE>   <B>http://WebServerURL/YourSubWeb/formtoemail2.htm</B>

</PRE>to this:
<P>
<PRE>   <B>http://WebServerURL/YourSubWeb</B> /_vti_bin/shtml.exe/formtoemail2.htm.

</PRE>This error will occur anytime that you have a configuration issue with any of
the dynamic run-time components in FrontPage.
<P>
If the form is configured to save results to a file, or to send e-mail
simultaneously, and the FrontPage Server Extensions are not configured to
handle e-mail, a 0-byte file will be created. It will not contain any data,
you will not see an error message, and the mail will not be sent.
