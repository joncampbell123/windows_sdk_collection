<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FrontPage 97 for Windows with Bonus Pack
<LI>Microsoft FrontPage for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.0a, 1.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you start either FrontPage Explorer or FrontPage Editor, you may
see any of the following errors messages:
<P>
<PRE>   There is no open Web to receive this page. Please open a Web, and
   then save this page again

   -or-

   FrontPage Explorer caused an access violation.

   -or-

   Cannot get the To Do List from the Server.

   -or-

   Server error: _vti_bin/_vti_adm does not refer to a page in this
   Web Ole32.dll caused an invalid page fault.

   -or-

   Unable to connect to the FrontPage Explorer.

   -or-

   Unable to connect to the FrontPage Editor.

   -or-

   FPEDITOR caused an invalid page fault in module Ole32.dll.

   -or-

   FPEDITOR caused an invalid page fault in module Mfc40.dll.

</PRE>These problems are likely to occur when you start FrontPage Editor from
FrontPage Explorer, or when you save a file from FrontPage Editor back to a
Web, or when you use the FrontPage Editor toolbar button to return to
the FrontPage Explorer.
<P>
Note that other error conditions may produce similar error messages.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
There are two common causes for these errors when working with
FrontPage.
<P>
First check your computer name in either the Identification tab of the
Network Properties or in the Networks Control Panel. Also check the host
name for your computer on the DNS tab of the TCP/IP properties sheet. If
either of these names contains non-alphanumeric characters (except for
periods in a DNS host name or dashes in a computer name), FrontPage may be
unable to resolve the name to a valid program on your computer. This
happens with FrontPage running under Windows NT and Windows 95, and Windows
3.x (for FrontPage 1.0).
<P>
If the computer name does not contain an illegal character, but you
are still receiving these errors, your Windows 95 system may need to be
updated with the OLE Update for Windows 95.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Computer names with non-alphanumeric characters are illegal computer
names in Transmission  Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). Since
FrontPage uses TCP/IP for authoring operations, illegal TCP/IP names
generate errors.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1: Illegal Character in Computer Name</h3>
 
<P>
Take the illegal character out of the computer name. For example, if
your computer's name is
<P>
<PRE>   My@Work or my@work.mycompany.com

</PRE>then rename it to
<P>
<PRE>   My-Work or my-work.mycompany.com


</PRE>NOTE: If other computers on your network are using shares you have
created or have links pointing to your Web pages, those computers may
need to re-establish those connections or links.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Method 2: No Illegal Characters in Computer Name, Windows 95 Systems</h3>
 
<P>
Install the OLE32 update from
<P>
<PRE>  <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows95/info/oleupd.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/windows95/info/oleupd.htm</A></B>

</PRE>NOTE: Because the Microsoft Web site is constantly updated, the site
address may change without notice. If this occurs, link to the
Microsoft home page at the following address:
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com">http://www.microsoft.com</A></B>

   TITLE     : "@" Character in Computer Name Causes OLE Error
               Messages

</PRE>If you attempt to name computer running Windows NT 4.0 with a restricted
character, you receive an error message that indicates that your computer
name will not be accessible via internet protocols and will create a
substition of a "-" character for every unacceptable character. In
additon, Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 does not allow you to enter a restricted
character into the DNS Host Name. Windows NT 3.51 does not permit you to
enter a restricted character in a DNS name.
<P>
Windows NT WINS Services automatically substitutes "-" characters
for illegal characters in the computer name in the WINS database. This
may not actually prevent these error messages from appearing because
FrontPage uses the DNS name if it is present.
<P>
FrontPage uses the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) protocol to
communicate between FrontPage Editor or FrontPage Explorer components of
the program and the Web server session. HTTP is a component of the TCP/IP
protocol, and non-alphanumeric characters other than a hyphen or a period
are illegal in TCP/IP names. The "." character is reserved for separating
host names from domain names.
