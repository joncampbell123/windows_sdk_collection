<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Server Side Includes (SSI) can pose a security threat to any web server. 
If executable SSI are enabled on a server that contains a FrontPage 
feedback form, the security threat will be increased. This security threat 
occurs under specific conditions as described in the "More Information" 
section of this article.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The FrontPage Server Extensions enable you to write HyperText Markup Language 
(HTML) from a Web browser into a form and have it accurately evaluated by the 
Web server.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft strongly recommends that you disable executable SSI on any 
server on which you have installed the FrontPage Server Extensions.
<P>
If your server must retain support for executable SSI, install the 
updated version of the FrontPage Server Extensions. You can download the 
updated FrontPage Server Extensions from the following Microsoft web 
site:
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/frontpage/wpp/exts.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/frontpage/wpp/exts.htm</A></B> 

</PRE>The updated FrontPage Server Extensions will not allow HTML tags in any 
feedback form. Instead, the FrontPage Server Extensions will convert the HTML 
tags into the corresponding character entities that represent the code. For 
example, the less than sign (&lt;) will be converted to &amp;lt; and the greater than 
sign (&gt;) will be converted to &amp;gt;. This allows you to enter the HTML code into 
the feedback form. When you browse the form, the code will appear exactly as you 
typed it when you filled out the feedback form.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft FrontPage
Server Extensions version 2.0.2.1112. This problem was corrected in
Microsoft FrontPage Server Extensions version 2.0.3.209.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Any web site that uses the FrontPage Server Extensions and where the
results from a WebBot Discussion component, WebBot Confirmation component, or 
WebBot Save Results component are saved to a public HTML page, such as a guest 
book, can be compromised by server-side executable commands entered into a 
feedback form.
<P>
On Web servers that support SSI, the include capabilities are disabled
by default. They can be activated by the administrator of the Web
server. If they are enabled, the server only parses files with a mime
type of either text/x-server-parsed-html or text/x-server-parsed-html3.
Neither of these mime types exists in most standard mime types.
Therefore, by default, no files are parsed for server-side includes even
if SSI is enabled. If the administrator of the Web server enables SSI,
SSI can still be configured to turn off #exec includes by modifying the
configuration files for the Web server.
<P>
If the Feedback Form is altered to create a file with the proper SSI
extension, and if the server is configured to allow executable server-
side includes then the new content can execute arbitrary programs on the
server.
<P>
The revised version of the FrontPage Server Extensions will still
convert valid URLs into hyperlinks.
