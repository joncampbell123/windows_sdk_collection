</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how to transfer a FrontPage Web from a local
Web server or disk to an Internet or intranet server.
<P>
You can also use this information to transfer any Web from one Web
server to another.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
There are many ways to get your Web content to the Internet, from
using simple File Transfer Protocol (FTP) to using the FrontPage
Server Extensions to posting directly to a Web server by using the HyperText
Transport Protocol (HTTP).
<P>
All methods for getting FrontPage Web content to the Internet start
with the Publish FrontPage Web command (File menu) in FrontPage Explorer. If you
installed the FrontPage Server Extensions on the destination Web server,
FrontPage can communicate directly with the extensions on that server. If the
FrontPage Server Extensions are not installed on the destination server, or
if you are not sure if they are installed, you can install the Microsoft Web
Publishing Wizard from the FrontPage compact disc and then publish your files
to the destination server.
<P>
<P><h3>Publishing Your FrontPage Web to an Internet Web Server</h3>
 
<P>
FrontPage 98:

<OL><P><LI>In FrontPage Explorer, open the Web you want to publish.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Publish FrontPage Web.

<P><LI>In the Publish dialog box, click to clear the Changed Pages Only check box
   and then click More Webs.

<P><LI>Type the path of the destination Web server.
<P>
</OL>FrontPage 97:

<OL><P><LI>In FrontPage Explorer, open the Web you want to publish.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Publish FrontPage Web.

<P><LI>In the Destination Web Server box, type the Internet address of the Web
   server. The address of the server appears immediately after the protocol
   (http:) and the double slashes (//).

<P><LI>In the "Name of destination of FrontPage Web" box, type the name
   of the destination Web. (This should be the name of the folder that will
   contain your Web content.)
<P>
   NOTE: If you want to publish the Web directly to the document root of the
   Web server (usually only if you have a domain of your own), do not enter
   the name of the destination Web. If you are unsure what to enter as the
   destination Web, consult your Internet Service Provider (ISP) or intranet
   webmaster.

<P><LI>Click to select the Copy Changed Pages Only check box. All your pages will
   be published to the destination server. Click to select the "Add to existing
   Web" check box if your ISP has already established your site.

<P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
</OL><h2>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>FrontPage 98</h3>
 
<P>
FrontPage will first attempt to communicate with the FrontPage Server
Extensions on the destination Web server. If the server extensions are
properly installed on the destination server, this is all you need to
do. If the FrontPage Server Extensions are not found on the
destination Web server, FrontPage will start the Web Publishing
Wizard to connect with the Web server.
<P>
The wizard will ask for the FTP server name and directory path. The FTP server
name is the domain name of the web server to which you are publishing (for
example, ftp.server.com). The directory path is the folder on the server where
your Web content is stored (for example, /www). The wizard will also request a
user name and password for access to the FTP server.
<P>
NOTE: To determine what the FTP server name and directory path is for your
destination server, or for more information about the user name and password for
the FTP server, consult your Internet Service Provider.
<P>
For more information about the Publish FrontPage Web command, click the Index
tab in FrontPage Help, type the following text
<P>
<PRE>   publishing, FrontPage Webs

</PRE></OL>and then double-click the selected text to go to the "To publish the current
FrontPage Web" topic.
<P>
<P><h3>FrontPage 97</h3>
 
<P>
FrontPage will first attempt to communicate with the FrontPage Server
Extensions on the destination Web server. If the server extensions are
properly installed on the destination server, this is all you need to
do. If the FrontPage Server Extensions are not found on the
destination Web server, and if you installed the Microsoft Web
Publishing Wizard, FrontPage will automatically start the wizard
and use it to connect with the Web server.
<P>
The first time you start the Microsoft Web Publishing Wizard you may be
prompted for the protocol, the name of the Web server on which you want to post
your content, and other connection information. To obtain the correct values,
contact your Internet Service Provider or intranet webmaster.
<P>
The Web Publishing Wizard will also ask you what files you want to post. To
properly post your Web, FrontPage will pass the Web Publishing Wizard a list
of files. The files are stored in an "upload" folder in a temporary folder
where FrontPage is installed. Do not edit this if you want to properly post
your Web. Once configured successfully, all subsequent posts to the
specified Web server will occur automatically.
<P>
