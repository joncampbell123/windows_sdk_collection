The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FrontPage 97 for Windows with Bonus Pack
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The "More Information" section of this article includes a
comprehensive list of the new and improved features and functionality
that you will find in FrontPage 97 with Bonus Pack. With the
enhancements to the core FrontPage product and the addition of the
Bonus Pack, FrontPage is the Web suite that gives you all the tools
you need for creating and managing professional quality Web sites.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Ability to Display, Verify and Correct Office 97 Hyperlinks</h3>
 
<P>
Through the FrontPage 97 server extensions, FrontPage 97 Explorer can
manage hyperlinks into and out of Office 97 documents.
<P>
<P><h3>Support for JavaScript/VBScript</h3>
 
<P>
You can directly enter script in FrontPage Editor. The script will run
when the file is posted on a Web server and browsed with a browser
that supports the scripting language.
<P>
<P><h3>Support for ActiveX Controls</h3>
 
<P>
FrontPage Editor can insert, format, and affect the properties of any
ActiveX Control. Through the new scripting interface you can even
insert VBScript or JavaScript routines that work with the control.
<P>
<P><h3>Support for Java Applets</h3>
 
<P>
FrontPage Editor can insert, format, and affect the properties of any
Java Applet. Through the new scripting interface you can even insert
VBScript or JavaScript routines that work with the applet.
<P>
<P><h3>Support for Netscape Plug-ins</h3>
 
<P>
Netscape plug-ins can be inserted into the FrontPage Editor and you
can define their size and layout.
<P>
<P><h3>Cross-web Spelling Checker</h3>
 
<P>
FrontPage uses the same Spelling checker engine as Office (instead of
a duplicate copy of it as in FrontPage 1.1). FrontPage 97 also uses
the same custom dictionary as Office 97 (or the first dictionary if
there are multiple dictionaries).
<P>
<P><h3>Text/Spreadsheet Converters</h3>
 
<P>
FrontPage 97 uses the same converters as Microsoft Office 97.
FrontPage 97 can convert any of the following file formats to HTML:
<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft Excel Worksheet (.xls, .xlw)
   WordPerfect 6.x (.wps, .doc)
   Lotus 1-2-3 (.wk1, .wk3, .wk4)
   Word 6.0/7.0 for Windows &amp; Macintosh (.doc)
   Word 97 (.doc)
   Word (Asian versions) 6.0/95 (.doc)
   Word 4.0-5.1 for Macintosh (.mcw)
   Word 2.x for Windows (.doc)
   Works 3.0 for Windows (.wos)
   Works 4.0 for Windows (.wps)
   WordPerfect 5.x (.doc)
   Recover Text from Any File (*)

</PRE><h3>Thesaurus</h3>
 
<P>
FrontPage installs the same thesaurus as Office 97. If you have
already installed Office 97, FrontPage will use the installed copy.
<P>
<P><h3>Ability to Edit Raw HTML Source Code</h3>
 
<P>
The View HTML command in FrontPage Editor allows you to directly edit
the source HTML.
<P>
<P><h3>Preview in Browser</h3>
 
<P>
You can directly preview your page in any installed browser at any of
four screen resolutions.
<P>
<P><h3>Cross-web Find and Replace</h3>
 
<P>
In FrontPage Explorer, the Find and Replace commands will check all
content in the web.
<P>
<P><h3>Support for the Creation of Sub Folders within the Web Content Area</h3>
 
<P>
The folder view in FrontPage Explorer works the way the Windows 95 or
NT 4.0 Explorer does. It allows you to organize your files. It also
allows you to create subfolders within subfolders.
<P>
<P><h3>Drag-and-drop Functionality</h3>
 
<P>
The FrontPage Explorer and Editor support drag-and-drop functionality.
You can drag files into FrontPage Explorer for auto-import. You can
drag files from one location in the web to a sub-folder to quickly
rearrange the files in the web and the FrontPage Explorer will
automatically correct all the hyperlinks into and out of the document.
You can also drag images, text documents, Microsoft Excel Ranges, and
Hyperlinks into FrontPage Editor to insert new elements. You can also
drag existing elements from one part of a page to another or from page
to page within FrontPage Editor.
<P>
<P><h3>Import Web Wizard</h3>
 
<P>
Assists in converting entire folders to FrontPage format within a web
server.
<P>
<P><h3>Easy Hyperlinks to Current Page Through Use of Browsers</h3>
 
<P>
New World Wide Web hyperlinks will default to the URL currently
displayed in your default Internet browser.
<P>
<P><h3>Typed URLs Automatically Become Hyperlinks</h3>
 
<P>
If you type a full URL, FrontPage will automatically make it a
hyperlink.
<P>
<P><h3>Color-coded HTML source code</h3>
 
<P>
When you view the HTML source code in FrontPage Editor, you have the
option to view the HTML tags, names, values, and content in different
colors.
<P>
<P><h3>Improved and Expanded Toolbars in FrontPage Editor</h3>
 
<P>
FrontPage adds the Advanced toolbar and arranges all toolbars in an
easier and more intuitive way.
<P>
<P><h3>Database Connection Wizard</h3>
 
<P>
This new wizard will create Internet Database Connector (IDC) files
for you. All you need to enter is the ODBC data source, the table
structure of the data source, and the SQL statement.
<P>
<P><h3>Ability to Resize Images in FrontPage Editor</h3>
 
<P>
You can drag the edge of an image to stretch, compress, expand, or
shrink it while preserving its aspect ratio. In addition, you can
specify a set pixel width or percentage of screen width for both
height and width on an image.
<P>
<P><h3>Web Administrators Can Mark a Folder as Executable</h3>
 
<P>
Administrators can mark a folder as executable (as long as the
webmaster hasn't explicitly denied this right).
<P>
<P><h3>Marquee Tag</h3>
 
<P>
Support for the Marquee tag is available in the FrontPage Editor.
<P>
<P><h3>"Getting Started with Microsoft FrontPage" Dialog Box</h3>
 
<P>
This dialog box gives you a choice of actions to take when you first
start Explorer or whenever a web is closed.
<P>
<P><h3>Watermark</h3>
 
<P>
Allows you to specify a non-scrolling background image on a page.
<P>
FrontPage Explorer Screen Improvements
<P><h3>(Screen Tips, Highlighted Links)</h3>
 
<P>
Visual hints everywhere regarding the item your mouse is pointing at.
<P>
<P><h3>Background Sounds</h3>
 
<P>
Built-in support for the BGSOUND tag. Note that Netscape Navigator 3.0
and earlier do not support the BGSOUND tag.
<P>
<P><h3>Extensible HTML and Custom WebBot Components</h3>
 
<P>
Using the FrontPage 97 Software Development Kit (SDK) on the FrontPage
97 with Bonus Pack CD, and a development environment (like Visual C++
or Visual Basic), you can create your own custom WebBot components and
specify how they appear in the FrontPage Editor.
<P>
Insert Video (AVI)
 
<P>
Built-in support for the DYNSRC attribute of the IMG tag. Allows you
to insert a video into an HTML page. Note that Netscape Navigator 3.0
and earlier do not support the DYNSRC attribute of the IMG tag.
<P>
<P><h3>Fully Customizable Menus</h3>
 
<P>
The FrontPage 97 Software Development Kit (SDK) on the FrontPage 97
with Bonus Pack CD includes instructions for inserting custom menu
items.
<P>
<P><h3>Page Margins</h3>
 
<P>
The FrontPage Editor supports the topmargin and leftmargin attributes
of the BODY tag.
<P>
<P><h3>Horizontal Rule Colors</h3>
 
<P>
You can specify the color of the horizontal rules you insert with
FrontPage Editor.
<P>
<P><h3>Form Field Validation</h3>
 
<P>
FrontPage can perform simple validation on the data entered in
FrontPage form fields. The validation is written in JavaScript or
VBScript (your choice) and can check for things like the presence or
absence of data, the length of data, and the type of data.
<P>
<P><h3>Bullet and Numbering Styles</h3>
 
<P>
FrontPage Editor supports ten different styles of bullets or
numbering.
<P>
<P><h3>Dataless Bookmarks</h3>
 
You can insert a bookmark without needing any text as a basis. The result
of this is a blue flag with an underline in the FrontPage Editor where the
bookmark is inserted.
<P>
<P><h3>Improved Internet Information Server (IIS) support</h3>
 
<P>
Support for NT Challenge/Response Authentication:
<P>
The FrontPage Client and Server Extensions for IIS can validate
FrontPage authors and Administrators using the NT Challenge/Response
(NTLM) authentication scheme. This means that when you run FrontPage
on an NT domain, access to the IIS (as well as to the Microsoft
Personal Web Server and NT 4.0 Peer Web Services) will be granted
based on the user's NT Logon account. In this configuration it is no
longer necessary to re-enter a separate username and password to
access the IIS server; logging on to the network is sufficient to
identify yourself to the server.
<P>
Automatic Correction of NTFS Permissions Problems:
<P>
On Internet Information Servers hosted on NTFS partitions, FrontPage
Setup will automatically correct permissions problems on all files
necessary for the smooth operation of the FrontPage Server extensions.
The Check Installation feature of the FrontPage Server Administrator
was enhanced to correct permissions problems automatically.
<P>
Default permissions on files and directories were enhanced to ensure
that executable directories are inaccessible to non-privileged user
accounts.
<P>
Other Enhanced IIS Features:
<P>
Other Enhanced IIS Features include

<UL><LI>New user interface for adding users and groups.

<LI>Support for Secure Sockets layer (SSL)

<LI>Extensions install as ISAPI DLLs on IIS 2.0, leading to significant
   performance enhancement.

<LI>FrontPage Administrators no longer need to be NT Administrators.
<P>
</UL><h3>More Server Extensions for UNIX</h3>
 
<P>
Server Extensions for UNIX are supported for the following operating
systems:
<P>
<PRE>   BSD/OS 2.1
   Digital UNIX 3.2c, 4.0 (Alpha)
   IRIX 5.3, 6.2
   Linux 3.0.3 (from Red Hat software)
   Solaris 2.4, 2.5
   SunOS 4.1.3, 4.1.4
   HP-UX 9.03, 10.01

</PRE>FrontPage Server Extensions also include extensions for the following
Servers:
<P>
<PRE>   Apache 1.0.5, 1.1.1
   CERN 3.0 NCSA 1.5a, 1.5.2 (we do not support 1.5.1)
   Netscape Commerce Server 1.12
   Netscape Communications Server 1.12
   Netscape Enterprise 2.0
   Netscape FastTrack 2.0

</PRE><h3>Ability to Create Disk-based Webs</h3>
 
<P>
You can use FrontPage to manage files directly on your hard disk
without the need for a Web server or server extensions. The browse-
time WebBot components will not function, but all of the save-time
WebBot components will work fine.
<P>
For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : FP97: Some WebBot Components Don't Work on Disk-Based
               Web

</PRE><h3>Script Wizard (Similar to HTML Control Pad)</h3>
 
<P>
The Script Wizard can help you understand the methods and events
associated with the browser and any ActiveX or scriptable Java applets
on your page. You can choose between writing VBScript or JavaScript
with the Script Wizard. NOTE: The Script Wizard is installed by Microsoft
Internet Explorer. It will not be available if Internet Explorer is not
installed on your computer.
<P>
<P><h3>Hit Counter WebBot Component</h3>
 
<P>
The Hit Counter WebBot component is included with the FrontPage
Software Development Kit (SDK) as an example of how you can create
your own custom WebBot components. It is a fully functional WebBot component
that can be installed even by non-programmers. Read the files in the
/frontpg/fpsdk20/WebBot/fpcount directory of the FrontPage 97 with Bonus Pack
CD for details. Microsoft Technical Support does not support this software. If
you have trouble installing or configuring the Hit Counter WebBot, you should
refer to the FrontPage Software Development Kit or contact a Microsoft Solution
Provider. To locate a Microsoft Solution Provider in your area in the U.S. and
Canada, call the Microsoft Sales Information Center at (800) 426-9400.
If you are outside the United States, contact your local subsidiary. To
locate your subsidiary, see the Microsoft World Wide Offices Web site

</PRE><h3>Microsoft Image Composer</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft Image Composer is the easy way to arrange, customize, and
create your on-screen images. Use it to make your Web sites come alive
with professional-looking images. Microsoft Image Composer features
the use of innovative technology that frees you from the traditional
way of arranging images and allows you to:

<UL><LI>Produce professional-looking results easily
<LI>Customize your images the way you want
<LI>Quickly make your images ready for the Web
<P>
</UL>For more information, see the Microsoft Image Composer Web site at:

</PRE><h3>Microsoft Personal Web Server</h3>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Personal Web Server includes a Hypertext Transport
Protocol (HTTP) and a File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server. Microsoft
Personal Web Server is fully integrated into the Windows 95 taskbar
and Control Panel, allowing users to start and stop HTTP and FTP
services, administer the server, or change general options. Microsoft
Personal Web Server includes an HTML-based administration utility that
also supports full remote administration. It supports both user-level
and local security. Users can set up the Microsoft Personal Web Server
to support Windows NT Challenge/Response (NTLM) encrypted-password
transmission. The Microsoft Personal Web Server's support for NTLM
allows remote FrontPage authors and administrators to be validated by
their network logon username and password within the context of a
Windows NT network, bypassing the need to re-enter this information
when authoring. The Microsoft Personal Web Server disables security
when authoring locally so you will not be prompted for your name and
password as long as you are running FrontPage from the same computer
where the Microsoft Personal Web Server is installed. Microsoft
Personal Web Server fully supports existing standards such as CGI and
includes the open Internet Server API (ISAPI) extension to the Win32
API that is up to five times faster than CGI-based applications.
<P>
Microsoft Personal Web Server also supports simple database access
through the Internet Database Connector (IDC).

Web site at:
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/iesupport/content/mspws/">http://www.microsoft.com/IESupport/content/mspws/.</A></B>

</PRE><h3>Support for Microsoft Visual Source Safe</h3>
 
<P>
Using Microsoft Visual SourceSafe 5.0 you can put your FrontPage web
under source control. FrontPage Explorer becomes the front end for
managing check- in and check-out of files amongst a set of authorized
users you define. SourceSafe provides a feature-rich back end for
performing version control functions.
<P>
<P><h3>Table Creation Similar to Microsoft Word</h3>
 
<P>
You can click on the Insert Table toolbar button and drag the mouse
over a sample grid to specify the rows and columns needed in a new 
table.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0</h3>
 
<P>
Included on the FrontPage 97 with Bonus Pack CD.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Web Publishing Wizard</h3>
 
<P>
The FrontPage 97 with Bonus Pack CD includes Microsoft Web Publishing
Wizard version 1.1. This utility allows for publishing any content to
any server running:
<P>
<PRE>   The FrontPage Server Extensions
   A Windows File Share mapped into an HTTP server
   An FTP share mapped into an HTTP server

</PRE>It can also post directly to many standard HTTP Servers without the
FrontPage Extensions.
<P>
For more information, see the Microsoft Windows Web site at:
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/software/webpost/">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/software/webpost/</A></B> .

</PRE><h3>Support for Secure Sockets Layer</h3>
 
<P>
FrontPage can author and administer webs directly on the secure port,
allowing for complete encryption of all data and safety from intruders
or hackers.
<P>
<P><h3>Spanning WebBot Components</h3>
 
<P>
In FrontPage 1.1, you must use the FrontPage Explorer in conjunction
with the FrontPage Editor to edit any page that contained dynamic
content. This is due to a file architecture requiring two files for
every page with dynamic WebBot components.
<P>
FrontPage 97 introduces a simpler architecture, which includes all the
arguments for the dynamic WebBot components in the same file as the
one the browser uses.
<P>
Versions available in French, German, Italian, Spanish, Japanese
 
<P>
FrontPage offers a single worldwide compact disc for the best
worldwide web authoring product.
<P>
<P><h3>Other New Features in FrontPage 97</h3>
 
<P>
FrontPage 97 also includes the following features:

<UL><LI>Support for PowerPoint Animations

<LI>Support for Table and Cell background colors, background images,
   and border colors

<LI>Support for True Type Fonts

<LI>Enhanced documentation (200+ page user guide and improved Help)
