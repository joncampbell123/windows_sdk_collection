This article describes the switches you can use with the Microsoft FrontPage 
Setup program.

<P><h3>FrontPage 98 Setup Switches</h3>
 
<P>
FrontPage 98 has three setup switches: /f, /r, and /s.
<P>
<PRE>Setup /f   The /f switch allows you to select one of several languages
           in the multi-language version of FrontPage.  This switch can
           only be used when the Setup program is run from the root folder
           of the compact disc. The setup /f command uses the following
           syntax

              &lt;x&gt;:\setup /f

           where &lt;x&gt; is the drive that contains the Setup program. After
           you run this command, the Setup program will prompt you to
           select which language version of FrontPage to install.

           As an alternative to using the /f switch, you can specify the
           language on the command line, like this

              &lt;x&gt;:\setup &lt;language&gt;

           where &lt;x&gt; is the drive that contains the Setup program and
           &lt;language&gt; corresponds to one of the following language
           abbreviations:

              DEU (German)
              ENU (English)
              ESP (Spanish)
              FRA (French)
              ITA (Italian)

setup /r   The /r switch records all choices you made while running the
           Setup program. It also stores these results in the Setup.iss
           file. This file is saved in the folder in which you installed
           Windows. The setup /r command uses the following syntax

              &lt;x&gt;:\Frontpg\&lt;language&gt;\setup.exe /r

           where &lt;x&gt; is the drive that contains the setup program and
           &lt;language&gt; corresponds to one of the following language
           abbreviations:

              DEU (German)
              ENU (English)
              ESP (Spanish)
              FRA (French)
              ITA (Italian)

           The Setup.iss file will be executed if you run the Setup program
           with the /s switch. In this case, the Setup program will use this
           file as a template as it performs a silent installation.

setup /s   The /s switch installs FrontPage "silently," meaning that little
           or no user intervention is required when the Setup program is run.
           During the installation process, the Setup program reads the
           information in the Setup.iss template that was created when you
           previously ran Setup with the /r switch. The steps recorded in the
           Setup.iss file are carried out silently, making it easier for network
           administrators to install the same components of FrontPage on
           multiple computers. The Setup.iss file must reside in the folder
           that contains the FrontPage Setup program.

           NOTE: Because you cannot copy the Setup.iss file to the FrontPage
           compact disc, you will have to copy the &lt;lang&gt; folder and all of its
           contents to a file or network location.

           The setup /s command uses the following syntax:

              &lt;x&gt;:\Frontpg\&lt;language&gt;\setup.exe /s

           where &lt;x&gt; is the drive that contains the setup program and
           &lt;language&gt; corresponds to one of the following language
           abbreviations:

              DEU (German)
              ENU (English)
              ESP (Spanish)
              FRA (French)
              ITA (Italian)
