The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FrontPage 97 for Windows with Bonus Pack
</UL> 
<P>
IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you start FrontPage Editor from within FrontPage Explorer, you
receive the following error:
<P>
<PRE>   Unable to connect to the FrontPage Editor.

</PRE>When you attempt to save a file to FrontPage Explorer from FrontPage
Editor, you receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Could not make connection to the FrontPage Explorer. Please try to
   start the FrontPage Explorer from the Start menu or the icon in the
   program group.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This error may result from any of the following conditions:

<UL><LI>Illegal TCP/IP name
<LI>Resource limitations
<LI>Errors in the video subsystem
<LI>Registry errors
<LI>Missing registry keys
<LI>Missing FrontPage registry key
<LI>Mismatched OLE components on Windows NT
<LI>Problems with Windows installation
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Start with the first method and proceed to the next method until the
problem is corrected.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1: Illegal TCP/IP Name</h3>
 
<P>
Check the name of the computer and correct it. For more information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../frontpg/q156909.htm">Q156909</A></B>
   TITLE     : FP: OLE Errors When Working With FrontPage

</PRE><h3>Method 2: Resource Limitations</h3>
 
<P>
Make sure you have sufficient free resources. FrontPage 97 requires a
minimum of 16 megabytes (MB) of memory if you are running the Personal Web
Server. If you are running other programs or services, they will be using
resources that otherwise would be available to FrontPage. To free up
resources, try either of the following:

<UL><LI>Restart your computer.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Shut down all programs except for Windows Explorer and Systray.
<P>
</UL><h3>Method 3: Errors in Video Subsystem or Registry Errors</h3>
 
<P>
Start FrontPage Editor as a stand-alone program by double-clicking the
Fpeditor.exe file in the \Program Files\Microsoft FrontPage\bin folder.
Because FrontPage registers itself when you start it, it may be able
to fix any registry errors related to it. If you still receive errors after
starting FrontPage Editor, follow these steps.
<P>
NOTES:

<UL><LI>Do not replace any .dll files if FrontPage Editor starts.

<LI>Do not rename the Ntdll.dll file in step 1 if you are running Windows
   NT.

</UL><OL><P><LI>Rename the following files, located in the Windows\System folder. These
   files are hidden files.
<P>
<P><PRE>      Ntdll.dll
      Avifil32.dll
      Advapi32.dll
</PRE>
<P><LI>From the Windows 95 compact disc, copy the three files listed in
   step 1 to the Windows\System folder on your hard disk.
<P>
   Try to run FrontPage Editor. If you still receive errors after
   performing steps 1 and 2, follow these steps:
<P>
   a. Rename the following files, located in the Windows\System folder.
<P><PRE>      These files are hidden files.
</PRE><P>
<PRE>         Dciman.dll
         Dciman32.dll

   b. From the Windows 95 compact disc, copy the two files mentioned in
      step a to the Windows\System folder on your hard disk.

</PRE><P><LI>Try to run FrontPage Editor again.
<P>
</OL><h3>Method 4: Undo Registry Cleaning Utilities</h3>
 
<P>
If you used a utility to clean the Registry (remove obsolete registry
keys), restart the registry cleaning program and restore the Registry to
its previous state. If the program does not provide a feature to restore
previous Registry entries, go to Method 5.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 5: Absence of Required Registry Keys</h3>
 
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor
can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>

Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete

in Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.
If you are running Windows NT, you should also update your Emergency Repair
Disk (ERD).
<P>
Microsoft has received reports that some computers appear to be "losing"
the Registry settings that FrontPage needs to run properly. Microsoft has
not determined why some computers are losing these Registry settings while
other computers are not.

   3. Double-click the Fix97.reg file.

   4. When you receive a message indicating that the information was
      successfully registered, click OK.

   If you still receive the errors described in the "Symptoms" section of
   this article, skip to Method 6.

</PRE></OL>If You Are Using Windows NT 4.0:

   6. Open the HKEY_Current_User key and select the top folder in the
      left pane.

may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor
can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

<P>
On some computers, FrontPage 97 Setup does not create the following
registry key:
<P>
<PRE>   [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\FrontPage\Editor]
   "Auxiliary DLL Registered For"="2.0.2.1112"

</PRE>The existence of this key affects how long it takes FrontPage to start. On
computers where this Registry key is missing, FrontPage Explorer and
FrontPage Editor time-out prematurely.
<P>
It you determine that this key is missing from the Registry, use the
following steps to install it.
<P>
Windows 95:
<P>
<PRE>   After you back up your Registry, follow these steps:

   1. Download the Fp169079.exe file from the Microsoft Software Library.

      The Fp169079.exe file is available to download from the Microsoft
      Software Library (MSL):

         Aux97.reg

   3. Double-click the Aux97.reg file.

   4. When you receive a message indicating that the information was
      successfully registered, click OK.

</PRE>Windows NT 4.0:
<P>
<PRE>   Back up the following Registry keys:

         HKEY_CLasses_Root
         HKEY_Current_User

   To back up these Registry keys, do the following:

   1. On the Start menu, click Run.

   2. In the Open box, type "regedt32 /v" (without the quotation marks).

   3. Open the HKEY_Classes_Root key and select the first folder in the
      left pane.

   4. On the Registry menu, click Save Key.

   5. Type a file name and select a location where you want to save this
      file.

   3. Double-click the Aux97.reg file.

   4. When you receive a message indicating that the information was
      successfully registered, click OK.

</PRE>If you still receive the errors described in the "Symptoms" section, go to
Method 7.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 7: Mismatched OLE Components on Windows NT</h3>
 
<P>
FrontPage 97 calls OLE32.dll and OLEAUT32.dll files when making the
connection between FrontPage Explorer and FrontPage Editor. These files may
make further calls to other elements of the OLE subsystem. In the event
your installation of OLE has been improperly upgraded or has become
mismatched, a full installation of the most recent Service Pack for Windows
NT may solve the problem. If you have followed all of the previous steps
without success, try installing the latest Windows NT Service Pack from the
following Web site:
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/ntserver/info/">http://www.microsoft.com/ntserver/info/</A></B>

</PRE>NOTE: Follow the Service Pack Setup directions explicitly. Also, be sure to
quit any programs which may use OLE before you install the service pack.
<P>
If you still receive the errors described in the "Symptoms" section, you
will need to reinstall Windows NT to a new folder.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 8: Reinstall Windows</h3>
