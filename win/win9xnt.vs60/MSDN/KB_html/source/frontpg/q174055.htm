The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FrontPage 98 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how to create a Channel Definition Format (CDF) file
and some of the tags used in the CDF file.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
As a content provider, you can create one CDF file for each type of Channel
you want for your Web site. A CDF file allows users to subscribe to your
FrontPage Web as a Channel or a desktop component.
<P>
When users subscribe to your FrontPage Web as a Channel, they can browse your
Web offline, display updates to your Web on their screen saver, and download
or receive e-mail notifications when pages in your FrontPage Web are
modified. This feature is available only in Web browsers that support Channel
Definitions, such as Microsoft Internet Explorer, version 4.0.
<P>
<P><h3>Creating a Channel Definition Format File</h3>

   - End date.
   - How often you want the user's computer to check for updates
   - The time schedule you want to delay connections to your site.
<P>
   Click Next.

<P><LI>On the Log Target panel, in the Log Target URL box, enter the Uniform
   Resource Locator (URL) of the Common Gateway Interface (CGI) script you
   will use to process the information, click Browse to locate the CGI
   script, or leave the Log Target URL box blank. Click Next.

<P><LI>On the Finish panel, in the File Name box, enter the name of the CDF file
   you want or click Browse to select a specific file. Click Save.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: You can see your CDF file by clicking All Files on the Views bar in
FrontPage Explorer.
<P>
<P><h3>Channel Tags</h3>
 
<P>
A CDF file is a text file that contains a list of HTML tags, which reference
specific Web pages on a particular Web site. (These tags, along with the
entire CDF file description, have been submitted to the Word Wide Web
Consortium and are awaiting acceptance.) Some of the new HTML tags in the CDF
file that are created by the wizard are discussed below.
<P>
All CDF files must begin with the following tag:
<P>
<PRE>   &lt;?XML Version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1" ?&gt;

</PRE></OL>This identifies the file as an Extensible Markup Language (XML) file so that
it can be processed appropriately by the browser.
<P>
The &lt;Channel&gt; and &lt;/Channel&gt; tags start and finish the CDF file. You can use
multiple &lt;Channel&gt; tags to create sub-channels. The hyperlink reference
(HREF) attribute for this tag points to the top-level Web page in the
Channel.
<P>
The &lt;Title&gt; tag allows you to specify a title for the Channel. You will be
able to see this in the Channels list on the Favorites menu.
<P>
The &lt;Abstract&gt; tag allows you to specify a text string that displays a
ToolTip when the mouse passes over an item. You can specify an abstract for
the primary Channel and each item within the Channel.
<P>
The &lt;LogTarget&gt; tag allows you to specify a custom CGI script that records
information about browsing habits of users logged on to the Channel.
<P>
The &lt;Schedule&gt; tag allows you to schedule the time intervals for updating
subscriptions and delaying connections.
<P>
The &lt;Log&gt; tag specifies which graphics are used in the Channel Bar on the
Windows active desktop and in the Channels list on the Favorites menu.
<P>
The &lt;Item&gt; tag denotes each individual page of content on the Web-site that
you
want to be displayed in the Channel.
<P>
The &lt;Scope&gt; tag defines whether the pages in the Channel are to be downloaded
to the subscriber's computer or the subscriber must connect to your Web to
view changes.
<P>
The Channel Definition Wizard outputs a valid CDF file. The Channel
Definition Wizard does not create some of the advanced features that can be
used in CDF files. These features are:
<P>
<PRE>  - Time zones in download schedules.
  - Multiple items for a given HREF.
  - Control of Web crawling levels.
  - Separate control of the Netcaster-compatibility anchor tag.
  - Sub-channels.
  - PurgeTime or Type On Tracking elements.
  - Per-item control over the Track attribute.
  - Per-item control over the Logo element.

</PRE>NOTE: Microsoft FrontPage does not provide an interface that allows you to
edit the CDF file and add these tags. However, if you edit the CDF file in
Notepad, FrontPage will preserve your changes the next time you run the
Channel Definition Wizard.
