<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
FrontPage can convert pasted text, inserted file segments in HTML pages,
or entire files from several formats to HTML. This article presents an
overview of how FrontPage handles document conversion to HTML and
answers the following questions:
<P>
<PRE>   When will FrontPage attempt to convert a file to HTML?
   Why does the conversion process show two stages?
   How does FrontPage decide which converter to run?
   What Formats can FrontPage convert to HTML?
   How are converters installed and where are they located?

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When Will FrontPage Attempt to Convert a File to HTML?
 
<P>
FrontPage will attempt to convert a File to HTML when you do any of the
following:

<UL><LI>Paste text from a non-HTML document

<LI>Click File on the Insert menu in FrontPage Editor and select a non-
   HTML document

<LI>Use a drag and drop operation. Using the right mouse button, drag a
   non-HTML document to FrontPage Explorer. When you release the mouse
   button, click "Copy Here as Web Format" on the shortcut menu.
<P>
</UL><h3>Why Does the Conversion Process Show Two Stages?</h3>
 
<P>
FrontPage first converts documents from their native format to Rich
Text Format (RTF), and then it converts the RTF files to Hypertext
Markup Language (HTML). If the incoming file is already in HTML format
or in simple text, no converter is run. If the incoming file is RTF
only, the RTF to HTML converter is run.
<P>
<P><h3>How Does FrontPage Decide Which Converter to Run?</h3>
 
<P>
When FrontPage imports a file, the algorithm for determining which
converter will be run is as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   First the conversion routine looks at the extension of the file.
   For each converter registry entry that matches the extension of the
   file, that converter's entry point for the IsFormatCorrect routine
   is run. This routine reads the first few bytes of the incoming file
   and decides if it understands the format. The first converter that
   understands the format is then run to convert the file to RTF
   format.

   If FrontPage is unable to locate a converter that understands the
   file based on its extension, this procedure is repeated for each
   converter registry entry regardless of the file's extension.

   If FrontPage still can't find a converter to open the file, it will
   display the "Open File As" dialog box with buttons you can click to
   open the file as RTF, HTML, or text.

</PRE>What Formats Can FrontPage Convert to HTML?
 
<P>
FrontPage installs RTF converters for the following formats:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel Worksheet (.xls, .xlw)
<LI>Word (Asian versions) 6.0/95 (.doc)
<LI>Word 2.x for Windows (.doc)
<LI>Word 4.0/5.1 for Macintosh (.mcw)
<LI>Word 6.0/95 for Windows&amp;Macintosh (.doc)
<LI>Word 97 (.doc)
<LI>WordPerfect 6.x (.wps, .doc)
<LI>Works 3.0 for Windows (.wos)
<LI>Works 4.0 for Windows (.wps)
<P>
</UL>These converters convert from the formats above to RTF format. FrontPage
will also install the converter to convert a file from RTF to HTML
format:

<UL><LI>HTML Document (.html, .htm, .htx, .asp)
<P>
</UL><h3>How Are Converters Installed and Where Are They Located?</h3>
 
<P>
FrontPage and Office 95 and Office 97 and other Microsoft programs
use the same location for shared converters (and the same registry keys
to point at these converters), installing or uninstalling any of these
programs may change the versions of the converters that you are running.
<P>
NOTE: The FrontPage 1.1 "RTF to HTML" converter (Rtf2html.dll) is not
included with FrontPage 97 or 98 for Windows.
<P>
FrontPage Setup does not treat converters as shared components. For
information about problems that may occur as a result of this behavior,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
