The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FrontPage 98 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft FrontPage 97 for Windows with Bonus Pack
<LI>Microsoft FrontPage for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1
<LI>Microsoft FrontPage for the Power Macintosh, version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Cancellation of the Publish FrontPage Web command in FrontPage 98, FrontPage 97,
FrontPage 1.0 for the Macintosh, (or the Copy Web command in FrontPage for
Windows, versions 1.0 and 1.1) may result in a partial transfer of the FrontPage
web to the destination server.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Hypertext Transport Protocol maintains no information about the state
of the connection between the server and the client. The Publish
FrontPage Web operation first creates the directories on the
destination Web, then copies files into them. There is no way for
FrontPage to efficiently delete files which were transferred during
the earlier moments of the Publish Web operation.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Resuming the Publish FrontPage Web command (or Copy Web in earlier
versions) to the same destination and allowing it to complete should
correctly place any files which were missed during the initial
transfer. If your intention is to delete the files on the destination
server, then you may use FrontPage 97 Explorer's folder view (or
Summary View in earlier versions) on the destination server to delete
individual unwanted files. If you are unsure which files were
transferred, then completing an uninterrupted publishing operation
will allow you to open the destination Web as a separate entity and
delete it.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design. FrontPage will never leave a partially
updated file - any given file is either completely updated or not
updated at all.
