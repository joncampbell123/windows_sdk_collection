<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) Active Server Pages (ASP)
pose unique challenges to authors using FrontPage 97. This article
discusses some important considerations about using FrontPage 97 to
manage or edit Active Server Pages.
<P>
NOTE: Earlier versions of the FrontPage Server Extensions do not
support IIS ASP syntax. To use Active Server Pages, install the
FrontPage 97 Server Extensions for the Microsoft Internet Information
Server.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
FrontPage 97 allows you to create and manage Active Server Pages. In
general, when you create Active Server Pages in FrontPage Editor, be
aware of the following considerations:

<OL><P><LI>FrontPage 97 cannot manage links which originate in a Meta tag. It is
   customary to create links to Active Server Pages by using the
   http-equiv "REFRESH" attribute of the Meta tag. However, links that
   originate in a Meta tag do not appear as links in the FrontPage
   Explorer and they are not updated when you rename or move the files
   that link to or from these links.

<P><LI>Save the file using the .asp file name extension. IIS 3.0 requires
   the .asp file name extension in order to process Active Server
   Pages.

<P><LI>Save the file in an executable directory. Files that are stored in
   a non-executable directory do not execute. For example, when you
   view the page in a web browser, the page is not interpreted and
   rendered correctly by the web browser and the code is displayed
   instead of its result.
<P>
   NOTE: You cannot browse an executable directory. If you mark a
   directory that contains HTML pages as executable, users will not
   see your content.

<P><LI>FrontPage Editor treats ASP syntax as a text-level object and
   requires that it be embedded within one of the following HTML
   elements:
<P>
<P><PRE>      paragraph (&lt;p&gt;)
      table row (&lt;tr&gt;) and table cell (&lt;td&gt;)
      list (&lt;li&gt;)
</PRE><P>
   On the other hand, if the ASP is the value of a tag attribute,
   then the ASP does not need to be embedded within an HTML element.
   (See item 6 below.)
<P>
   If the ASP code is not embedded inside an HTML tag or as a tag
   attribute, the FrontPage Editor automatically inserts the opening
   and closing tags around the ASP code. In this case, FrontPage also
   automatically removes these tags when you save the page or when you
   click the HTML command on the View menu. Although this process does
   not adversely affect most HTML, FrontPage 97 may rearrange the syntax
   of your ASP code in such a way that it ceases to function properly.
   In this case, you may need to embed the affected code inside an
   HTML element, such as a paragraph, table, or list element using the
   View Or Edit HTML dialog box. (To access this dialog box, click
   HTML on the View menu.)

<P><LI>Active server pages can contain scripted links, as in this example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      &lt;a href="/&lt;%objnextlink.getnexturl("/www/nextlink.txt")%&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
</PRE><P>
   FrontPage Explorer reports these links as broken; however, the
   links function if you post your content on a properly configured
   IIS 3.0 server.

<P><LI>FrontPage Editor maintains an internal list of HTML tags which
   allow extended attributes. If you attempt to insert ASP code inside
   a tag that does not allow extended attributes, the ASP code is
   discarded by the FrontPage Editor. For additional information,
   please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../frontpg/q161420.htm">Q161420</A></B>
<PRE></PRE>      TITLE     : FrontPage Editor Deletes Unknown Attributes in HTML

</PRE><P><LI>Server-side includes do not expand in the FrontPage Editor. They
   are parsed into an HTML markup section. They still function if
   posted on a properly configured IIS 3.0 server. The following is an
   example of a server side include:
<P>
<P><PRE>      &lt;!--#include virtual="/test.inc"--&gt;
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: An HTML markup section is created from the View Or Edit HTML
   dialog box.

<P><LI>Multiple line link structures may be stripped out. Active Server
   Pages can process multi-line scripts to evaluate the correct URL to
   render in a web browser. FrontPage 97 does not parse an HREF attribute
   on an Anchor tag if the HREF contains either a carriage return or a
   line feed character. To preserve this code, type the code in the
   View Or Edit HTML dialog box.

<P><LI>Any method or function which needs to be at the very top of the
   file must be invoked in VBScript bacause FrontPage will move all other
   file data after the &lt;!DOCTYPE&gt; tag. If routines using these methods
   are called within VBscript syntax (&lt;% %&gt;) then they will not be
   moved below the DOCTYPE line by FrontPage.
<P>
</OL><h2>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To create Active Server Pages in FrontPage 97 Editor, use the following
steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Insert menu, click Script.

<P><LI>Under Language, select VBScript, and then click to select Run
   Script On Server.

<P><LI>In the Script box, type the ASP code.

<P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
   FrontPage will automatically surround your code with the "&lt;%"
   and "%&gt;" characters to enable execution on an IIS 3.0 server.
<P>
   NOTE: You can also type the server code in the View Or Edit HTML
   dialog box, but you must manually add the &lt;% and %&gt; characters to
   enable execution on an IIS 3.0 server.
<P>
   FrontPage inserts the Visual Basic Script icon in your document to
   indicate that a Visual Basic script has been added to your page.
   You can view or edit the script by double-clicking the icon.
<P>
   You may also add scripts to the attributes of HTML tags if the tags
   support extended attributes. Any tag which supports extended
   attributes will include an Extended button in its Properties dialog
   box. In this case, a Visual Basic Script icon is not displayed in
   the FrontPage Editor.
