The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FrontPage 98 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how to design your own themes and how to modify and
customize the appearance and properties of the professionally designed themes
that ship with Microsoft FrontPage 98.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Installing Theme Designer</h3>
 
<P>
To install Theme Designer, quit all programs and then do the following:

<OL><P><LI>On the Windows Start menu, click Run.

<P><LI>In the Run dialog box, click Browse.

<P><LI>Select the drive that contains the FrontPage 98 compact disc.

<P><LI>Open the \SDK\Themes\Designer folder and double-click Tdsetup.exe.

<P><LI>Follow the instructions on your screen.
<P>
</OL><h3>Starting Theme Designer</h3>
 
<P>
After the Setup program has completed, start FrontPage Explorer and start
Theme Designer by clicking Show Theme Designer on the Tools menu.
<P>
<P><h3>Theme Verification Assistant</h3>
 
<P>
When you install Theme Designer, another utility called Theme Verification
Assistant, is also installed. To run this program, open Windows Explorer and
double-click the Thmveras.exe file in the \Program Files\Microsoft
FrontPage\Bin folder. You can use this program to verify that the custom
themes you created meet the basic requirements to work well with FrontPage.
Because it analyzes one or more theme folders and creates a report that can
be saved or printed, it is very useful if you create your themes without
using Theme Designer.
<P>
<P><h3>Design Elements in Theme Designer</h3>
 
<P>
Theme view in FrontPage Explorer only shows partial theme elements. Theme
Designer, on the other hand, shows you all of the design elements of a theme,
including the following:

<UL><LI>Theme name
<LI>Banner
<LI>Top-level navigation buttons
<LI>Horizontal navigation buttons
<LI>Vertical navigation buttons
<LI>Body text
<LI>Regular hyperlink text
<LI>Active hyperlink text
<LI>Followed hyperlink text
<LI>Horizontal rule
<LI>Table border colors
<LI>Headings
<LI>Navigation buttons (Home, Up, Previous, and Next)
<LI>Horizontal alignment of elements
<LI>Vertical alignment of elements
<P>
</UL>When you rest the pointer over a theme element, the pointer changes into a
hand and the element's name appears in the status bar. If you want to change
the properties of an element or see a dynamic preview, you can open the
element's Properties dialog box by double-clicking the element or right-
clicking the element and then selecting the appropriate command on the menu
that appears.
<P>
<P><h3>Design Elements in FrontPage 98 Themes</h3>
 
<P>
FrontPage 98 themes define elements and settings for the following
categories:
<P>
<PRE>   Colors                 Graphics
   ------                 --------

   Text                   Bullets
   Headings               Banners
   Beckgrounds            Navigation Icons
   Table Borders          Navigation Bar Buttons
   Links                  Horizontal Lines

</PRE></OL><h3>Selecting a Font for Your Theme</h3>
 
<P>
Unlike a word processor, you cannot specify fonts in point sizes in the
HyperText Markup Language (HTML). The Web browser that is used to view the
page, not the author of the page, controls this. There are only seven
settings available. The following table lists the seven settings and their
respective values.
<P>
<PRE>   Point Size       HTML
   ----------       ----

   8                Heading 6
   10               Heading 5
   12               Heading 4
   14               Heading 3
   18               Heading 2
   24               Heading 1
   36               Text

</PRE>When you select a font for a theme, you should select a universal font--one
that is likely to be installed on the computer from which your page will be
viewed. Selecting a font that is not likely to be installed on the browsing
computer will be a poor choice. To specify one or more alternative fonts,
separate each font with a comma, like this:
<P>
<PRE>   Verdana, Arial, Helvetica

</PRE>In this example, Verdana is the primary font used by the theme. If Verdana is
not installed on the browsing computer, Arial will be used. Because Verdana
and Arial are both Windows-based fonts, you can specify a third font, such as
Helvetica. Helvetica is available on Macintosh computers.
<P>
The following fonts ship with FrontPage. You should select one of these fonts
when you design your theme.
<P>
<PRE>   Arial
   Arial Black
   Arial Narrow
   Arial Rounded MT Bold
   Book Antiqua
   Bookman Old Style
   Brush Script MT Italic
   Century Gothic
   Century Schoolbook
   Comic Sans MS
   Courier New
   Garamond
   Georgia
   Haettenschweiler
   Impact
   Times New Roman
   Trebuchet MS
   Verdana

</PRE><h3>Choosing Colors for Your Theme</h3>
 
<P>
All colors that you want to use for your theme should be in the 216 color
safe palette for Microsoft Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator Web
browsers. These colors result from all RGB (Red/Green/Blue) combinations of
0, 51, 102, 153, 204, and 255.
<P>
<P><h3>Saving a New or Modified Theme</h3>
 
<P>
When you have finished creating a new theme or editing an existing one, click
Save As on the File menu to save the theme as a new theme, or click Save to
overwrite the original theme with your changes. Note that you cannot
overwrite the original FrontPage 98 themes that are shipped on the FrontPage
98 compact disc. These themes are read-only.
