The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FrontPage 98 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft FrontPage 97 for Windows with Bonus Pack
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
<P>
</UL><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft FrontPage, you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   In FrontPage 98:

      Server Error This server has encountered an internal error which
      prevents it from fulfilling your request. The most likely cause is a
      misconfiguration. Please ask the administrator to look for messages
      in the server's error log.

   In FrontPage 97:

      An HTTP server error has occurred. An error has occurred in the HTTP
      server which made it impossible for the FrontPage Server Extensions
      to process this request (HTTP Error 500).

</PRE>when you do either of the following:
<P>
<PRE>   Case 1: You browse a page that contains an image map or a WebBot.

   -or-

   Case 2: You create a new Web.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may occur for either of the following reasons:

<UL><LI>If you are using Microsoft Personal Web Server, FrontPage is
   not able to execute Shtml.dll (Case 1).
<P>
   -or-

<LI>If you are using FrontPage Personal Web Server, FrontPage is
   not able to execute Shtml.exe (Case 1).
<P>
   -or-

<LI>FrontPage cannot access the server through the extensions (Case 2).
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, use the appropriate method for your
situation.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1: Check Error Logs and Memory (Case 1)</h3>
 
<P>
Check the error logs for any out of memory errors and then verify the
amount of physical and virtual memory installed on your computer.
<P>
If you are using the FrontPage Personal Web Server, the error logs will be
located in the \Server\Logs folder (FrontPage 1.1) or the \Httpd\Logs
folder (FrontPage 1.0).
<P>
If you are using Microsoft Personal Web Server, the error logs will be
located in the \Windows folder.
<P>
You should have 16 megabytes (MB) of RAM in order to run the FrontPage
Personal Web Server or Microsoft Personal Web Server. You should also set
a permanent swap file that is at least 20 MB in size.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 2: Check Configuration Settings (Case 1)</h3>
 
<P>
If you have changed the default content folder for the FrontPage Personal
Web Server, check the following:

<UL><LI>The definition of the DocumentRoot in the Srm.cnf file.

<LI>The following settings in the Srm.cnf:
<P>
   FrontPage 1.0:
<P><PRE>      WinScriptAlias  _vti_bin/ c:\content\_vti_bin
</PRE><P>
   FrontPage 1.1:
<P><PRE>      WinScriptAlias  _vti_bin/ c:\FrontPage/Webs\content\_vti_bin
</PRE><P>
</UL>If you have changed the default content folder for the Microsoft Personal
Web Server, check the following:

<UL><LI>The Document Root is defined in the Directories tab of the Internet
   Services Administrator. To access the Internet Services Administrator,
   follow these steps:
<P>
   1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Control
<P><PRE>      Panel.
</PRE><P>
   2. Double-click the Personal Web Server icon.
<P>
   3. Click the Administration tab.
<P>
   4. Click Administration.
<P>
</UL><h3>Method 3: Check the Shtml.exe or Shtml.dll File and File Size (Case 1)</h3>
 
<P>
If you have not changed the default content folder, check the following:

<UL><LI>If you are using FrontPage Personal Web Server, verify that the
   \_vti_bin\shtml.exe file exists and that its file size is greater than
   0. This file is located in the DocumentRoot folder.

<LI>If you are using Microsoft Personal Web Server, verify that the
   \_vti_bin\shtml.dll file exists and that its file size is greater than
   0. This file is located in the DocumentRoot folder.
<P>
</UL>NOTE: You can use these same methods to troubleshoot this type of error on
other Web servers. Check your Web server's documentation for the proper
location of server-generated error logs and the proper method for changing
DocumentRoot and marking directories as executable.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 4: Check Whether the Server is Running (Case 2)</h3>
 
<P>
Verify that the server is running. If it is not running, start it. Confirm
it is started by browsing to the URL for the HTTP server.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 5: Verify the Server Extensions Are Installed (Case 2)</h3>
 
<P>
Verify that the server extensions have been installed on the server. To do
this, start the FrontPage Server Administrator and click Check. Confirm
that the server information is correct.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 6: Install the FrontPage Server Extensions (Case 2)</h3>
 
<P>
Install the FrontPage Server Extensions. You can download the FrontPage 98
Server Extensions from the following Microsoft World Wide Web site:
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/frontpage/softlib/current.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/frontpage/softlib/current.htm.</A></B>

</PRE>NOTE: Because the Microsoft Web site is constantly updated, the site
address may change without notice. If this occurs, link to the Microsoft
home page at the following address:
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com">http://www.microsoft.com</A></B>

</PRE>The FrontPage 1.1 Server Extensions are stored in a self-extracting, self-
executing file in the Microsoft Software Library called:
<P>
<PRE> ~ <A href="http://support.microsoft.com/download/support/mslfiles/fp11ext.exe">Fp11ext.exe</A> <I>(size: 511200 bytes)</I>
