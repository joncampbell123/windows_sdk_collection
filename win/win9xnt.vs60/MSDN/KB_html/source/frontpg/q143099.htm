The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FrontPage for Windows, version 1.0
<LI>Microsoft FrontPage Personal Web Server, version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you start the FrontPage Personal Web Server or when you try to open a
web page in the FrontPage Explorer, you receive the following error message
<P>
<PRE>   HTTPD: Cannot determine local host name.

</PRE>followed by:
<P>
<PRE>   Use ServerName to set it manually.

</PRE>The installation routine in FrontPage 1.1 automates the process outlined
below. If you are using FrontPage 1.0 you will need to follow the steps
below to correct the problem.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Personal Web Server cannot identify the host name of your computer
or the host name is not fully qualified. A fully qualified domain name
consists of the host name (name of your computer) and a domain name
(such as microsoft.com) separated by a period. This error message occurs
when either of the following conditions exist:

<UL><LI>Your TCP/IP configuration does not have DNS enabled.

<LI>Your TCP/IP configuration includes a host name, but no domain name,
   or your configuration has a domain name, but no host name.
<P>
</UL>For more information on how to change the ServerName of the FrontPage
Personal Web Server please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../frontpg/q164294.htm">Q164294</A></B>
   TITLE     : FP: How to Change FrontPage Personal Web Server ServerName

</PRE><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, use the appropriate method for your situation:
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1: If DNS is not enabled for your TCP/IP installation</h3>
 
<P>
Run the configuration utility for your TCP/IP stack and enable
DNS. You will need to enter a host name and a domain name for
your computer. If you are on a TCP/IP network or use a service
provider for Internet access, your network administrator or
service provider can give you a host name and domain name as well
as the address of a DNS server. If you are not on a network, you
can use any name for your host and create a domain name for your
computer, such as Mypc.com. These fabricated names will not be
valid if your computer is connected to the Internet, but they
will allow the Personal Web Server to run locally.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 2: If your computer does not have a host name</h3>
 
<P>
If your computer does not have a host name or if DNS is not
enabled, work around the problem by using the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Using a text editor, such as Notepad, open the Httpd.cnf file.
   This file in FrontPage 1.0 is located in the c:\vermeer\httpd\conf
   subdirectory.
<P>
   In FrontPage 1.1, this file is located in the c:\FrontPage Webs\
</OL>Server\Conf\HTTPD.CNF

<OL><P><LI>Locate the section which describes the ServerName directive.
   It looks like this:
<P>
<P><PRE>      # ServerName allows you to set a host name which is sent back to
      # clients for your server. If it's different than the one the program
      # would get (i.e. use "www" instead of the host's real name). Make
      # sure your DNS is set up to alias the name to your system!
      #
      # Format: ServerName &lt;domain_name&gt;
      #
      # no default
</PRE>
<P><LI>Add the following line:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ServerName &lt;domain_name&gt;
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;domain_name&gt; is the name of your domain.
<P>
   NOTE: If your computer does not have DNS enabled and your TCP/IP
   stack supports it, you can use "localhost" (without the quotation
   marks) as your computer name. You will also be able to specify
   "localhost" if your computer has a host name that is not fully
   qualified. To determine if your TCP/IP stack supports this
   configuration, run the FrontPage TCP/IP test.

<P><LI>Save and close the file.

<P><LI>Start the Personal Web Server. It will run minimized and be in
   an idle state.
<P></OL>
