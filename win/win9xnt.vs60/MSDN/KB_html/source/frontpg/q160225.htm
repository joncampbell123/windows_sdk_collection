The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FrontPage 97 for Windows with Bonus Pack
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
FrontPage 97 and the Microsoft Personal Web Server may cause memory to
become fragmented when you do the actions listed in the following table.
<P>
<PRE>When you do this                     This Amount of Memory Is Fragmented
</PRE> 
<P>
<PRE>In FrontPage Explorer click Refresh   30K per transaction
</PRE>on the View menu
<P>
<PRE>In FrontPage Editor click Save on     5K-8K per transaction
</PRE>the File menu (and you then save
the file to a Microsoft Personal Web
Server Web)
<P>
NOTE: The information in this table was gathered from tests that used
repetitive operations with identical data. Actual usage will probably
cause less memory leakage, because the changing data will rescue some of
the stranded data from the fragmented memory heap. Note also that these
operations do not fragment memory in Windows NT, nor do they fragment
memory with the FrontPage Personal Web Server or O'Reilly &amp; Associate's
WebSite, or Netscape Corporation's FastTrack 2.0 on Windows 95.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To avoid performance degradation with the FrontPage Server Extensions on
the Microsoft Personal Web Server, restart it occasionally whenever your
system seems to be slow or low on memory.
<P>
The Microsoft Personal Web Server is designed as a Personal Web Server
only, and is not intended for high traffic Web sites. If you have a high
traffic Web site, you should upgrade to Windows NT Server and the
Microsoft Internet Information Server.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed
at the beginning of this article.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
A heavily used Microsoft Personal Web Server on Windows 95 may
eventually develop performance problems. A computer with limited hard
disk drive space will be more susceptible to these problems, because it
will run out of swap space sooner. If you are using disk-based Webs and
your system becomes slow or memory becomes low, restart FrontPage
Explorer (FrontPage Explorer using a disk-based Web is subject to the
same fragmentation as the Microsoft Personal Web Server).
<P>
NOTE: When the memory heap gets highly fragmented, the server process
tends to slow down (due to increased paging activity, and heap
operations take longer because the heap data structures are larger).
<P>
The third party products discussed here are manufactured by vendors
independent of Microsoft; we make no warrantee, implied or otherwise,
regarding these products' performance or reliability.
