The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FrontPage 98 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run the FrontPage 98 Setup program with the /s switch to perform a
scripted setup, you do not receive a message indicating that setup has
completed. The only indication you have that setup has completed is that the
hard drive activity has stopped.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs if you originally installed FrontPage by running the
Setup program with the /r switch and cleared the "Start FrontPage Explorer
Now" check box in the Setup Complete dialog box. When you run the Setup
program with the /r switch, the Setup program records a script that contains
a set of instructions. These instructions will be used by the Setup program
when you run the Setup program with the /s command. Because you cleared the
"Start FrontPage Explorer Now" check box in the Setup Complete dialog box,
FrontPage Explorer will not open at the end of installation and you will
receive no confirmation that setup has been completed.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this behavior and open FrontPage Explorer when the Setup
program has finished, click to select the "Start FrontPage Explorer Now"
check box in the Setup Complete dialog box when you run the Setup program
with the /r switch. This information will be recorded in the Setup.iss file,
which is created during installation, and it will affect all subsequent
installations of FrontPage.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
FrontPage allows you to run a scripted installation to eliminate interaction
with the workstation during setup. This allows you to quickly and easily
install FrontPage on multiple computers.
<P>
To perform a custom installation of FrontPage, you can use any of the
following three switches when you run the Setup program:
<P>
<PRE>   Switch      Description
   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

   /r          Records actions during installation.

   /s          Runs the script that is recorded when you use the /r switch.

   /f          Allows you to select one of several languages in the multi-
               language versions of FrontPage.
