<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In order to restrict end user access to specific IP addresses in FrontPage,
the Author and Administrator IP restrictions must be at least as rigorous
as the End User restrictions.
<P>
In FrontPage Explorer, if you click the End User tab in the Web Permissions
dialog box (on the Tools menu, click Permissions) and apply an IP address
restriction, FrontPage may still allow browsing to the Web from a
restricted IP address.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The security model of FrontPage assumes each successive group (End Users,
Authors, and Administrators) is comprised of a subset of members from the
group below it. In other words, all Authors must be End Users, and all
Administrators must be Authors. This allows Administrators to automatically
have authoring and browsing rights, and allows Authors to also browse the
Web. Because authoring and administration of a FrontPage Web must be done
through a browsing session, any IP restriction applied to End Users must
also apply to the Administrators and Authors groups to prevent browsing.
FrontPage doesn't challenge the user for a name and password to grant
access to a higher level of permission until an authoring operation is
attempted; therefore, all accounts initially are connected to the Web
server with End User security.
<P>
FrontPage offers the capability to define a separate IP restriction to each
group, but each successive level must have an equal or tighter restriction.
Because Administrators also have the right to author and browse, and since
authors also have the right to browse, it may be helpful to think of the IP
restrictions settings as being cumulative. For example, in a Web with the
following IP restriction
<P>
<PRE>   Administrators: *.*.*.*
   Authors:        244.24.*.*
   End Users:      244.24.57.*

</PRE>End Users will be able to browse from any computer on the network. Another
way to interpret the above table is as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   244.24.57.*  is granted the right to browse
   244.24.*.*   is granted the right to browse and the right to Author
   *.*.*.*      is granted the right to browse, the right to author, and
                the right to administer

</PRE>If the FrontPage Web has the following restrictions,
<P>
<PRE>   Administrators: 244.24.57.*
   Authors:        244.24.*.*
   End Users:      244.24.*.*

</PRE>then only End users with IP addresses beginning with 244.24 can browse the
Web, Authors can only come from 244.24.*.*, and Administrators can only
come from 244.24.57.*. Another way to interpret the IP restrictions above
is as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   244.24.*.*   is granted the right to browse
   244.24.*.*   is granted the right to browse and the right to author
   244.24.57.*  is granted the right to browse, the right to author, and
                the right to administer

</PRE>Note: The Microsoft Internet Information Server does not grant the right to
assign IP restrictions on a per directory basis. The IP restrictions dialog
box on a FrontPage Web being hosted on an IIS server will be disabled.
