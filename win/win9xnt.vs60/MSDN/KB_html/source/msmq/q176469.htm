<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how to handle programming to allow for location
independence of a queue. That is, how to allow you to change a queue's host
computer.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
MSMQ 1.0 doesn't provide "queue move" functionality. So, an application
that wants to move a queue must implement its own move routine. Note that a
queue cannot be moved to another computer and retain its identification
GUID(PROPID_Q_INSTANCE), because the globally unique identifier (GUID) can
neither be specified at create time, nor altered afterward through the MSMQ
API or MSMQ Explorer. This poses a problem when attempting to send messages
to the new queue, because a message is ultimately addressed with the
destination queue's GUID.
<P>
For location independence, the application needs to use a property or
combination of properties that can be duplicated to uniquely identify the
queue. An example of these is the label(PROPID_Q_LABEL), or combination of
Type GUID and label(PROPID_Q_LABEL). An application would then use Lookup
API to obtain the queue's GUID.
<P>
For example, to implement a single mobile queue, you would generate a GUID
to identify the queue and assign it as the Type GUID property. To move a
queue, the Type GUID would be assigned to the new queue after the old queue
was removed. For multiple mobile queues, you could generate and assign a
single GUID to the Type GUID property to represent a "mobile type" on all
mobile queues. The application could then use unique labels to identify
specific queues within the set of mobile queues.
<P>
Note that using lookup APIs generates network traffic to the Site
Controller. The application should implement caching if it is to be used
offline (and to minimize lookup traffic). A forwarding and/or notification
mechanism is necessary if the queue will be moved while the application is
running offline, or if replication and caching update delays result in
misdirected traffic (that is, messages sent to a cached queue GUID need to
be returned or forwarded to the appropriate queue GUID).
