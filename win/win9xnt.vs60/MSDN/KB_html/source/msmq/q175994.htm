</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The word "message" in "Microsoft Message Queue Server" (MSMQ) suggests that
the product is oriented toward e-mail "messages." Also, the product
description and overview at <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/msmq/">http://www.microsoft.com/msmq/</A></B> use the word
"messages" frequently, and offer analogies to e-mail systems to explain how
the product works. This has led to the frequently asked question, "Is MSMQ
an e-mail product that competes with Microsoft Exchange Server?"
<P>
The answer is No.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
MSMQ is a development tool that includes a store and forward protocol model
to be used for developing messaging applications. Exchange Server is a
messaging application that enables message interaction between people. MSMQ
is not an e-mail server positioned to compete with any of the existing
Microsoft e-mail solutions. These e-mail solutions can be used for
complimentary solutions targeted at different communication needs. For
example, Exchange Server moves electronic letters between Exchange Server
users, using a postoffice and mail folders. MSMQ moves data messages
between applications, using a system of store-and-forward queues. MSMQ
compliments Exchange Server, Microsoft Messaging, and MAPI clients by
interoperating with them, allowing the different clients to communicate.
<P>
The remainder of this article compares key similarities and differences
between MSMQ and e-mail in general.
<P>
<P><h3>Key Similarities with E-mail</h3>
 

<UL><LI>Asynchronous: Clients of both technologies need not be present (or
   running) for a message to be sent to them. Messages are stored until the
   recipient is available, then forwarded to them.

<LI>Addressing: Both types of messages indicate the address of sender and
   receiver.
<P>
</UL><h3>Key Differences with E-mail</h3>
 

<UL><LI>Application-to-application: The MSMQ client is an MSMQ application,
   whereas an e-mail client is generally a person.

<LI>The message body is data: The MSMQ message body is data, typically
   understood only by the applications that process the message. An e-mail
   message body is generally an electronic letter, understood by any person
   who reads it.

<LI>Connectionless: The MSMQ application does not need to be online to send
   messages. E-mail clients typically need a connection to their server or
   postoffice to send e-mail.

<LI>Simple, small and fast: MSMQ is optimized to provide the throughput
   required by enterprise applications.

<LI>Stronger guarantees than e-mail: MSMQ provides prioritized, guaranteed
   delivery and acknowledgments.

<LI>More delivery options: MSMQ provides options for express, disk based,
   and transactional delivery.
<P>
</UL><h3>Complimentary Functionality</h3>
 
<P>
MSMQ compliments and extends e-mail functionality by allowing the different
clients to communicate. For example, the MSMQ Exchange Connector connects
an MSMQ enterprise to a computer running Exchange Server, allowing users of
Exchange Server to send e-mail messages to an MSMQ application, and vice
versa. The MSMQ MAPI Transport provides the same functionality for MAPI
clients. The MSMQ Mail SDK provides C and ActiveX APIs for creating and
parsing messages in a subset of the MIME format. For more information about
the MSMQ Exchange Connector, MSMQ MAPI Transport and MSMQ Mail SDK, consult
the online MSMQ Administrator's Guide and MSMQ SDK Help.
