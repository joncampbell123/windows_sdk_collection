The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Message Queue Server version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Although Microsoft Message Queue Server (MSMQ) applications can open and
send to any queues in the MSMQ enterprise for which they have permissions,
they cannot open and receive messages from queues which are not on their
connected network.
<P>
For example, consider an enterprise with two connected networks using
different protocols, CN1 and CN2 with an MSMQ routing server connecting the
two. Clients on CN1 can send and receive messages to other clients on the
same CN. However, these same clients can only send messages to CN2. They
cannot open queues on CN2 for receive access.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design. Opening a remote queue for receive access and
reading messages from that queue are operations that require a direct
session between the two computers. By definition, computers on different
connected networks use different protocols and therefore, cannot establish
a direct session with each other making this operation impossible.
<P>
In the "Microsoft Exchange Administrator's Guide," the definition of a
connected network is
<P>
<PRE>   A collection of computers where any two computers can
   communicate directly.

</PRE>Important design note: Because MSMQ keys on the CN definition to
distinguish between computers that cannot communicate directly, as opposed
to computers that are temporarily offline, you must ensure that the CN
definitions properly reflect the computers' abilities to connect to each
other. Computers should not be placed in different CNs when they share the
same protocol and are on the same subnet. Doing this will lead to results
that may vary, based on the network and MSMQ routing server configuration.
