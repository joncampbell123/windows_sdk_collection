<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Message Queue Server (MSMQ) Explorer shows encrypted messages as
clear text in the destination queue.  This behavior is by design. You can
determine from the Explorer or from inside an application if a specific
message was encrypted when it was sent.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
MSMQ provides a secured channel for sending private, encrypted messages
throughout your MSMQ enterprise. MSMQ ensures that the body of private
messages are kept encrypted from the moment they leave the source Queue
Manager to the moment they reach their target Queue Manager.
<P>
Messages are encrypted at the source computer and decrypted at the
destination computer. With encryption and decryption provided by MSMQ Queue
Managers, applications do not have to encrypt messages when they are sent
or decrypt messages when they are received. They appear in the destination
queue as clear text for the receiving application to read.
<P>
The privacy level of a queue (PROPID_Q_PRIV_LEVEL) determines how the queue
handles encrypted messages. If a queue's privacy level is Optional
(MQ_PRIV_LEVEL_OPTIONAL), a user can verify whether a message sent to the
queue was encrypted or decrypted by checking the messages properties in
MSMQ Explorer. Take a look at the Sender tab in message properties in the
Explorer to find if it was encrypted or not.
<P>
You can pass PROPID_M_PRIV_LEVEL to MQReceiveMessage and look at the
returned value to find out if a message was sent encrypted.
<P>

private message using C API and ActiveX, take a look at "Private Messages"
topic in SDK Online help.
