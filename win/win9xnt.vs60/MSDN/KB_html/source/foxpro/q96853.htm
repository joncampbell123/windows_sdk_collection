<P>
<P><h3>NOW WHAT?</h3>
 
<P>
Congratulations! You've just been introduced to one of the most
powerful relational database management systems available. You've
learned to:

<UL><LI>Create tables and fill them with data.

<LI>View data in a Browse window.

<LI>Extract specific data using RQBE.

<LI>Create professional reports with the Report Writer.

<LI>Design custom screens with the Screen Builder.

<LI>Design menus with the Menu Builder.

<LI>Create an application.
<P>
</UL>You can now use the FoxPro power tools to quickly and efficiently
manage your data. But this is just the beginning. FoxPro is a dynamic
and multifaceted database management system. You can continue your
studies and develop your own custom applications that use all of
FoxPro's functionality.
<P>
There are many places to learn more about FoxPro. The first place to
look is in the remaining FoxPro manuals:

<UL><LI>The "FoxPro User's Guide" teaches you more about FoxPro's
   interface, including FoxPro's menus, Report Writer, Label Designer,
   Screen Builder, Menu Builder, RQBE, and Project Manager.

<LI>The "FoxPro Language Reference" contains FoxPro commands,
   functions, and system memory variables, listed alphabetically for
   easy access. It includes examples to demonstrate how to use the
   language.

<LI>The "FoxPro Developer's Guide" covers topics of particular interest
   to those who develop applications. Topics include tips for using
   projects, screens, menus, SQL SELECT, arrays, low-level file I/O,
   text merge, FoxDoc, and more.
<P>
</UL>The following additional sources are available:

<UL><LI>Classes on FoxPro in your area offered by trainers and local
   universities.

<LI>The "Microsoft FoxPro Resource Directory". This book can assist
   you in finding consultants and third-party FoxPro applications.

<LI>The Microsoft FoxPro Developer Conference. Contact Microsoft for
   more information.

<LI>Third-party FoxPro books.

<LI>FoxPro user groups.

<LI>Database oriented magazines.
<P>
</UL>As you can see, many options are available for learning more about
FoxPro. You can choose the option that meets your needs.
<P>
Good luck!
