The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In the Save As Class dialog box, you can't use the mouse to save a class to
an existing class library file (.vcx); all the .vcx file names are greyed
and clicking a file does not select it. It was expected that a mouse click
would select an existing class library to store the class.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
In the Save dialog box on the Macintosh platform, the file names are
dimmed, and it is not possible to select them with the mouse. This is a
Macintosh standard interface dialog box. The dialog box displayed when the
PUTFILE() function is called behaves in the same manner.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
When the Save As dialog box is displayed, you can type the name of the .vcx
in the Save Class As text box. This will allow you to store the class in
the existing .vcx file.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create a new form.
<P>
</OL>2  Place some controls on the form, and select them.

<OL><P><LI>Click Save As Class on the File menu. In the Save Class dialog box,
   type a Name, and click the More button to select a file name.

<P><LI>Change the folder to Samples\Mainsamp\Libs.

<P><LI>Click a .vcx name. All the class libraries are greyed.

<P><LI>Type Login.vcx in the Save Class As text box. Click Save. When you are
   returned to the Visual FoxPro Save Class dialog box, the file name is
   displayed in the File text box.
<P></OL>
