The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Setting the TabIndex property of a form within a formset changes the
activation order of the forms. However, the first form added to the formset
will always be activated first although its TabIndex property is set to a
value other than one.
<P>
The TabIndex property of a form within a formset can be used to determine
the activation order of forms within a formset. By default, the first form
added in a formset is activated first, the second form added is activated
second, and so on. By changing around the TabIndex properties for all the
forms within a formset, the activation order is changed and the form which
has a TabIndex property of 1, is expected to be activated first.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
By incorporating a few changes in the formset, it is possible to have the
correct form be activated as the first form within a formset. Using the
formset configuration as described below in the "More Information" section,
the following changes correct the behavior.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Follow to Correct Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create a new property for the formset called FirstTime.

<P><LI>In the Init method of the formset, add the following line of code:
<P>
   FirstTime=.T.

<P><LI>In the Activate method of Form1 of the formset (Form1 is the first form
   added to the formset), add the following lines of code:
<P>
   IF thisformset.firsttime=.T.
<P><PRE>      NODEFAULT
      ThisFormSet.FirstTime=.F.
      ThisFormSet.Form4.Command1.SetFocus
</PRE>   ENDIF
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft is researching this behavior and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following formset configuration illustrates resetting the TabIndex
property does not result in the desired form being activated first.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>On the File menu, click New. Then click Form and New File.

<P><LI>On the Form menu, click Create Form Set.

<P><LI>On the Form menu, click Add New Form three times. Form4 is the last form
   added to the formset.

<P><LI>Change the TabIndex property of each form as follows:
<P>
   Form1 (TabIndex Property set to 2)
   Form2 (TabIndex Property set to 4)
   Form3 (TabIndex Property remains at 3)
   Form4 (TabIndex Property set to 1)

<P><LI>Add a command button to each form.

<P><LI>In the click method of Form1, add the following line of code:
<P>
   ThisFormset.Release

<P><LI>Run the formset, and note that Form4 is not the first form activated as
   expected. However, the forms do cycle in their TabIndex order from that
   point on.
