The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b
<LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, version 2.5b
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Because the Pict To Bmp application that comes with FoxPro for Macintosh is
a "scriptable" application, you can instruct it to programmatically convert
a file of type "PICT" to a file of type "BMP" using AppleScript.
<P>
See below for instructions and a sample script.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following script can be called from within FoxPro for Macintosh or any
other application that can communicate with the AppleScript extension. The
script can be keyed into the AppleScript Script Editor supplied with the
AppleScript extension.
<P>
This script requires that Scripting Additions be installed in the
Extensions subfolder of the System Folder. The "choose file" Scripting
additions is utilized. These additions are supplied with the AppleScript
extension and placed in the Extensions folder by the Installer program.
<P>
Please note that due to the limitations of the character set used to
display and print this Microsoft Knowledge Base article, the line-
continuation character created by pressing OPTION+RETURN on the Macintosh
has been replaced by a semicolon (the FoxPro line-continuation character).
When you are typing the script in the AppleScript Script Editor, replace
any line that ends with a semicolon with the appropriate line-continuation
character.
<P>
To create the script:

<OL><P><LI>Start the AppleScript Script Editor.

<P><LI>In the Script Editor edit region where the cursor is initially blinking,
   type the following code:
<P>
<P><PRE>      -- Pict2Bmp, a routine for converting PICTs to BMPs
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      -- Get a file of type "PICT" to convert
      set theFile to choose file of type {"PICT"} ;
<PRE></PRE>         with prompt "Choose PICT to convert:"
      -- Call the conversion handler
      Convert(theFile)

      -- Conversion handler
      on Convert(fToConvert)
        -- Tell Pict To Bmp to convert the file
        -- and terminate.
        tell application "Pict To Bmp"
          open fToConvert
          quit
        end tell
      end Convert

</PRE><P><LI>Save the script. If the script will not save in its compiled format,
   make sure the script was typed exactly as it appears above, with the
   exception of the line-continuation characters. The Script Editor should
   help you focus in on the source of the error by highlighting the
   offending command.

<P><LI>To run the script from the FoxPro for Macintosh Command window, issue
   the following command
<P>
<P><PRE>      RUNSCRIPT &lt;pict2bmp&gt;
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;pict2bmp&gt; is the name of the file to which the script was saved.
<P>
</OL>The first time the script is run, a dialog box may appear requesting the
location of the "Pict to Bmp" application. It is located in the
FoxPro:Goodies:Misc folder. In Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, the application
is located in the VFP:Tools:Tools:PictToBmp folder. To avoid this message,
specify the full path to the application in the Convert handler of the
script. For example, use the following command:
<P>
<PRE>   tell application "HD:FoxPro:Goodies:Misc"

</PRE></OL>If the user chooses to cancel the script at any time during the execution
of the script, the following FoxPro error message will be displayed:
<P>
<PRE>   Script error: User canceled.

</PRE>To avoid the display of this message in the context of a FoxPro program or
application, use an ON ERROR handling routine to trap for error number
1917.
<P>
For more information about creating scripts with AppleScript, see the
"AppleScript Language Guide" or contact the Apple Programmer's and
Developer's Association (APDA).
