<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you define a list or combo box from an array, you should first declare
the array as a property of the form. This causes the array to be visible to
the form object, so the list or combo box can access it. You can then
populate the array within one of the methods of the form. This article
describes two techniques that can be used to populate the array and view
its elements in a list box or a combo box.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In the Form Designer, you can declare an array as a property of a form by
choosing Form New Property from the System Menu. For more information about
declaring and referencing the array declared as a member of a form, please
see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : How to Declare Arrays on Forms

</PRE>When a list box or combo box is initialized, it lists its elements from the
source specified with the RowSource and RowSourceType properties. The
number of elements displayed in the list is evaluated at definition time.
If the RowSourceType is 5-Array, and if the array is not dimensioned at the
time the list is defined, only one element will show. The number of
elements displayed in the list is not automatically evaluated when a change
is made to the array. Therefore, if the array is populated after the
control is initialized, the number of elements in the list has to be
reevaluated.
<P>
Following are two methods you can use to populate an array used as the
rowsource of a list box. They ensure that all of the elements of the array
are visible, even when it is populated after the list box control has been
initialized.
<P>
<P><h3>Method One: Fill the Array in the Load Event Handler</h3>
 
<P>
The Load event of a form is executed before the objects are initialized.
When the list or combo box controls are initialized, the array contains
elements and the NUMBEROFELEMENTS property of the list box is calculated to
accommodate all of the elements of the list. Here's an example:

<OL><P><LI>Declare the array atest(5) from the Form, New Property menu.

<P><LI>In the method for the LOAD event of the form, type:
<P>
   SELECT Cust_ID FROM SYS(2004)+"SAMPLES\DATA\CUSTOMER";
<P><PRE>      INTO ARRAY thisform.atest
</PRE>
<P><LI>Place a Combo box on the form, and modify the following properties:
<P>
   RowSourceType=5-Array
   Rowsource='Thisform.atest'

<P><LI>Save and run the Form. The list displays 90 elements.
<P>
</OL><h3>Method Two: Populate the Array in the Init Event Handler</h3>
 
<P>
It is possible to place the code that initializes the array in the Init
event handler of the control or the Init of the Form. However, in both
cases, the array is filled after the number of elements for the list has
been set. Because it is not dynamically evaluated, it is necessary to
reevaluate the number of elements of the list to size it appropriately.
<P>
Use the REQUERY method to re-query the source of the combo box. It will
adjust the number of elements displayed in the list. You can also manually
set the number of elements of the list by setting the NumberOfElements
property of the list. The following example illustrates this behavior. To
run the example, copy and paste the code in a program file. When the form
is displayed, the list shows only one element. Click the Fill the list
button to view the elements of the array in the list.

   ofrm1.show

the underlying data source is modified.
