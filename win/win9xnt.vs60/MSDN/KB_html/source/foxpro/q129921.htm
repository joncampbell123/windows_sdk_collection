<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article shows by example how to display a numeric value in its English
language equivalent. For example, in a program that prints checks, you can
use this technique to print the value $123.45 on the check as:
<P>
<PRE>   One Hundred Twenty Three Dollars and Forty Five Cents

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following code example takes the total number of digits to the left of
the decimal point of a given number and breaks them into groups of three
that include a ones place, a teens place, and a hundreds place.
<P>
For example, in the number 123,456.00, the 1 and the 4 are in the hundreds
place and the 2 and the 5 are in the teens place of their respective groups
of three. Understanding this principle is the key to understanding the code
in this article.
<P>
To demonstrate the following code example, open or switch to Microsoft
FoxPro and open an empty or new program file (PRG). Enter the following
code:
<P>
* X defines the number to be converted. This may be any value less
* than or equal to 9,999,999,999.00 and greater than or equal to 0.
* This upper limit is imposed by FoxPro as any larger numbers are
* expressed in scientific notation.
X = 1234567812.77
<P>
* Determine the string equivalent of the integer portion of X:
Z = LTRIM(STR(INT(X)))
<P>
* Determine how many places are to the left of the decimal point:
W = LEN(Z)
<P>
* Determine how many groups of 3 appear to the left of the decimal point:
Y = INT((LEN(Z) - 1) / 3)
<P>
* Determine how many places to the left of the left-most group of 3:
REMAIN = LEN(Z) - (Y * 3)
<P>
* Initialize MYTOTAL to null. MYTOTAL is a character variable used
* to hold the text equivalent of X.
MYTOTAL = ""
<P>
* Initialize PLACEHOLDER. PLACEHOLDER is a numeric variable used to
* track the position (to the left of the decimal point) of the
* current number being converted.
PLACEHOLDER = 0
<P>
* Initialize two variables that determine the initial of scale of X:
BILLION = .F.
MILLION = .F.
<P>
* Initialize a flag variable for teens so as not to combine the ones value
* with the returning text string:
TEENS = .F.
NEWVAR = ""
<P>
* Enter a loop that converts each number contained in X (starting with the
* left-most) to its character equivalent. W (originally the number of
* places to the left of the decimal point in X) is decremented by one each
* time a number within X is converted.
DO WHILE W &gt; 0
<PRE>     DO CASE
          * If REMAIN is 1 then the current number under conversion is in
          * the 'ones place' of the current group of three.
          CASE REMAIN = 1
               * A number is going to be converted, so decrease string
               * length by one:
               W = W - 1
               PLACEHOLDER = PLACEHOLDER+1
               * Set CURRENTNUM to the current number to be converted:
               CURRENTNUM = SUBSTR(Z,PLACEHOLDER,1)
               * Call procedure to convert CURRENTNUM to its text
               * equivalent:
               DO TRANS with CURRENTNUM
               * Determine the scale of CURRENTNUM based on current
               * value of W:
               DO CASE
                    CASE W = 9
                         SCALE = "Billion "
