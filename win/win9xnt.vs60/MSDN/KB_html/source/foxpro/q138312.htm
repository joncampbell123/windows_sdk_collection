The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the Image Editor to edit a .cur file located in the
\Vfp\Samples\Graphics\Cursors directory, it opens up the .cur file in "VGA-
Color 16 Color 32x32" mode by default. If the file is saved in the VGA
Color mode, it cannot be used in the DragIcon property of the form builder.
The .cur file has to be saved in "VGA-Mono 2 Color 32x32" mode. The error
"Cursor is corrupt or in wrong format" occurs if the .cur file is in VGA
Color mode.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
The only way to save it back to a Mono 2 Color mode is to copy the file to
the clipboard. Then on the File menu, click New, and paste it back in. Save
the untitled file as the same name of the .cur that was saved in VGA Color
mode. Once Image Editor saves it this way in Mono 2 Color mode, it can be
opened back up by Image Editor in Mono 2 Color mode instead of VGA Color
mode from then on.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.

<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Run the \Vfp\Imagedit\Imagedit.exe file.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Open. Change List Files of Type to *.cur.

<P><LI>Choose a .cur file from the \Vfp\Samples\Graphics\Cusrsors directory.
   Note that it is opened in "VGA-Color 16 Color 32x32" mode. Save the .cur
   file.

<P><LI>Create a new form, and place a text box on the form. Choose the DragIcon
   property from the Properties box, and select the .cur file that was
   saved in Image Editor. Note that the error "Cursor is corrupt or in
   wrong format" doesn't appear if a different .cur files is chosen.

<P><LI>Using the Image Editor, open the .cur file and copy it to the clipboard.
   On the File menu, click New, and then click Cursor in the Resource Type
   Box. Accept the default of "VGA-Mono 2 Color 32x32" in the New Cursor
   Image box, and paste the icon to the untitled file.

<P><LI>Save the untitled file as the name of the .cur file that was opened and
   saved earlier.

<P><LI>Go to the dragIcon property in Visual FoxPro, and choose the .cur file
   that was just saved. Note the error does not occur and that it will work
   when the form is run.

<P><LI>In Image Editor, open the .cur file, and note that it will now open in
   VGA Mono mode.
