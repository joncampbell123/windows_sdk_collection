<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Visual FoxPro 5.0 ships with a Solutions sample application,
VFP\SAMPLES\SOLUTION\SOLUTION.APP, that provides examples for
accomplishing common database and programming tasks. This article offers
some tips on how to find particular examples in the Solutions application
and more information about each example.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Solutions sample has a separate help file,
VFP\SAMPLES\SOLUTION\SOLUTION.HLP, that provides an overview of the
sample and a description of every element in the sample.
<P>
You can choose the Behind the Scenes button on any form to open the
description for that form. If you run a query or report from SOLUTION.APP,
open the description by pressing the F1 key. You can see a list of all
components by clicking on "List of Components" in the non-scrolling region
of the Solutions Sample topic. When you choose the Index button in the Help
file, you can search for samples by keywords. For instance, you could
search for BEGIN TRANSACTION to find the topic for the Nest Transactions
sample.
<P>
You can also filter samples by category in the Solution form by choosing
the "View samples by filtered list" Option button. If you were interested
in examples using arrays, for example, you could choose "Array
Manipulation" in the drop-down list to display the samples that use arrays,
whether or not that is the primary focus of the sample.
<P>
Another way to look at the sample applications is to open SOLUTION.DBF.
For example:
<P>
<PRE>   USE SOLUTION

   BROWSE FOR type != "N"

</PRE>A type of "N" indicates that the record is not a sample, but rather a
category for the treeview in solution.scx. The DESCRIPT field contains a
record for each component in the Solutions sample and a brief description
of the sample.
