The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In earlier releases of FoxPro, the default scale value has been the Foxel.
The definition of a foxel is:
<P>
<PRE>   A foxel is equivalent to the average height and width of a character
   based on the current font of the form in which an object is contained.
   Foxels are useful when developing cross-platform applications for
   character-based and graphical platforms.

</PRE>Beginning with Visual FoxPro, the default value for the Form and Class
designer is the pixel. As documented in the online Help file, the
definition of a pixel is:
<P>
<PRE>  The smallest element that can be displayed on a screen or printer.
  Pixels are screen-dependent.

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The ramifications for this can be significant. When designing a new class
or form, the default measurement unit is now the pixel. Because a pixel is
significantly smaller than a foxel, screens and all objects placed on them
will likely be mis-aligned unless the correct measurement unit is chosen.
<P>
The Scalemode property can be found on the Form Layout properties tab or it
can be accessed by code in a program. Visual FoxPro supports two entries
for this property:
<P>
<PRE>   0 - Foxels
   3 - Pixels

</PRE>In general, you should design forms and classes using the foxel measurement
when your application is intended to be used across platforms or when the
font metrics are likely to change (small to large fonts, for example). To
ensure that you are using the correct measurement, you will need to set it
explicitly. The following code demonstrates how to do it:
<P>
<PRE>    *--------------------------------------------------*
    * Demonstration of pixel versus Foxel scale modes. *
    *--------------------------------------------------*
    PUBLIC MyForm
    MyForm = CREATEOBJECT("MyForm")     &amp;&amp; To instance an new object

    MyForm.Show                         &amp;&amp; To Show

    DEFINE CLASS myform AS form
       scalemode = 0  &amp;&amp; Foxels
       ADD OBJECT cmd1 as commandbutton WITH ;
              top = 10, ;
              left = 10
    ENDDEFINE

    *End code definition

</PRE>With this definition, the button should appear in the lower third of the
form. If you change the scalemode to 3, the button will be moved to the
upper left corner of the screen. Again, if scalemode is not set to 0, this
will have the same effect as explicitly setting the scalemode to 3.
<P>
Alternatively, in a form, you can set this by going to the Form Layout
properties tab and choosing the appropriate value.
