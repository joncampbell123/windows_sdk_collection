The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, version 2.6
<LI>Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS, versions 2.6
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you have two reports in Catalog Manager, one created in dBASE and
another created in FoxPro, that have similar filenames (the first eight
characters are identical), the dBASE-style report overwrites the FoxPro-
style report when it is transported the first time it is printed or
modified.
<P>
After the dBASE-style report is transported, both entries will use the same
.FRX file.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in FoxPro version 2.6 for
Windows and FoxPro version 2.6 for MS-DOS. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 
<P>
This example uses the SAMPLES catalog file provided with dBASE.

<OL><P><LI>If the Catalog Manager is not displayed, choose Catalog Manager
    from the File menu.

<P><LI>Open the SAMPLES catalog file.

<P><LI>Choose the Report tab area. Select INVENTRY. Note that the Data
    Source is CONTENTS.DBF.

<P><LI>Choose New. From the Select A Table Or Query popup, select
    NAMES.DBF. Choose the Report Wizard button.

<P><LI>Select Report Wizard, and then choose Next.

<P><LI>Choose Next when prompted to select a style.

<P><LI>Move the LASTNAME and FIRSTNAME fields from the Available Fields
    list box to the Selected Fields list box. Choose Finish.

<P><LI>When prompted to enter a title for the report, choose Finish.

<P><LI>Save the report as INVENTRY.FRX.

<P><LI>FoxPro returns you to Catalog Manager. Select the original
    INVENTRY report (the report that lists CONTENTS.DBF as its
    source).

<P><LI>Choose Modify. You are prompted with the following message:
<P>
       File INVENTRY.FRX already exists. Overwrite it?
<P>
    Choose Yes.

<P><LI>When the report is finished transporting, close the Report Layout
    window.
<P>
</OL>After returning to Catalog Manager, note that there are still two entries
for INVENTRY, each listing a different data source. However, choosing
modify for either report modifies the INVENTRY.FRX file, which is based on
CONTENTS.DBF.
