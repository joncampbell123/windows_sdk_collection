The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, version 2.6
<LI>Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS, version 2.6
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Memory handles appear to be used but not released from within FoxPro for
Windows and FoxPro for MS-DOS when the following two conditions are met:

<OL><P><LI>A relational updatable query is created from within the Query Wizard and
   is made active.

<P><LI>The Screen Wizard or Report Wizard is entered.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 
<P>
CAUTION: The following procedure can result in an "Insufficient Memory"
error message after the steps have been executed numerous times
(approximately 10). This procedure should not be performed without closing
all other applications running under Windows first. This is a precaution,
as a general protection (GP) fault will also occur eventually. Should a GP
fault occur, quit and restart Windows before starting FoxPro again.

<OL><P><LI>Create a program containing the following line and add the program to
   your catalog:
<P>
<P><PRE>      WAIT WINDOW SYS(1011)
</PRE><P>
   This command will display how many memory handles you have used.

<P><LI>With the Updatable Query Wizard, create an updatable query that relates
   three or four tables. For example, link INVOICES to CUSTOMER and DETAIL
   (these tables are in the sample catalog). Make the new query active by
   choosing the Use push button while the query is selected (highlighted).

<P><LI>Run the program to show how many memory handles you've used.

<P><LI>With that query still active, start the Screen Wizard.

<P><LI>Choose Cancel in the first screen of the wizard.

<P><LI>Check your memory handles again by running the program.
<P>
</OL>Note that the number of memory handles used has increased markedly.
Continued repetition of the above steps will cause more and more memory
handles to be used and will eventually result in an "Insufficient Memory"
error message and then a GP fault.
