The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
<P>
</UL><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Because FoxPro reports are sent as separate print jobs, they are also
printed on separate pages. So, if you have two one-page reports and you
want to have them printed as one duplex report, you would have to combine
the reports into one, or combine the output of the two reports--as the
program code in this article illustrates.
<P>
NOTE: The COPY FILE command used at the end of this program may not work
under Windows NT. This is another issue being researched at this time.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
There are some cases where extra characters may be printed at the top of
the two pages, but adjustments can be made to the code to prevent this.
Specifically, you need to change the adjustment on the lines using the
FSEEK() function so that the file pointer is moved by fewer characters.
<P>
Please note the assumptions that this code makes:

<UL><LI>You have a printer connected to a local printer port (LPT1 for this
   code to work without modification), or you have captured a network
   printer to LPT1.

<LI>You have only two reports to be printed together, and they print
   one page each.
<P>
</UL>One additional note is that this program creates several files as temporary
files in the default directory. Please take note of the names of the files
so as not to overwrite any files you may already have (since SAFETY is
turned OFF). These temporary files are not deleted, but could be with only
a few additional lines of code.
