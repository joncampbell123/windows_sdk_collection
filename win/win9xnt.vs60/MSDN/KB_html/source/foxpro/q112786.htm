</PRE> 
Part 1:  Installing FoxPro for Macintosh
 
<P>
The following programs are known to cause problems during the
installation of FoxPro for Macintosh:
<P>
- Norton Utilities(R) Directory Assistance 2
- OnCue
- SuperBoomerang
<P>
To avoid problems while installing FoxPro for Macintosh, turn off all
extensions (INITs) and virus protection programs before starting. To
turn off extensions, restart the computer while holding down the Shift
key.
<P>
 
Part 2:  Installing FoxPro on to a Network Server
 
<P>
If you choose the second option for installing FoxPro onto a network
server (allowing users to run FoxPro from the server), do not install
FoxPro onto a share that will be locked. FoxPro needs read/write
permission to create the FOXUSER.DBF and FOXUSER.FPT files.
<P>
If, for security or other reasons, the FoxPro share must be locked,
here are two options to provide FoxPro with the read/write permission
it needs:

<OL><P><LI>Provide a copy of the FOXUSER.DBF and FOXUSER.FPT files in a read/write
   location.
<P>
   Each workstation user must set the RESOURCE= entry in their CONFIG.FPM
   file to point to the location of the FOXUSER.DBF file. To start FoxPro,
   they must double-click on the CONFIG.FPM file.

<P><LI>Use the RESOURCE=OFF command before exiting FoxPro, either in the
   command window or in CONFIG.FPM. Alternatively, use SET RESOURCE OFF in
   any running program.
<P>
</OL> 
Part 3:  Installing Apple Shared Library Manager
 
<P>
The Apple Shared Library Manager (ASLM) is an application developed by
Apple to allow applications to share code. ASLM must be installed
before you run FoxPro, or some FoxPro features will not work.
<P>
If you install new system software, you must also re-install ASLM.
<P>
To install the Apple Shared Library Manager:

<OL><P><LI>Close all running applications.

<P><LI>Insert the disk labeled "Apple Shared Library Manager."

<P><LI>Double-click on the Apple Installer icon.

<P><LI>Follow the instructions on the screen.
<P>
</OL>The ASLM installer modifies the System suitcase and adds an extension
called Shared Library Manager to the EXTENSIONS folder. The following
programs require ASLM. If FoxPro tries to run these without ASLM,
unexpected results may occur.

<UL><LI>FoxDoc
<LI>Beautify
<LI>FoxTools
<LI>Spell Checker
<LI>Wizards
<LI>IMPORT.APP
<LI>FoxPro for Macintosh Distribution Kit
<P>
</UL>The following libraries require ASLM and are installed in the EXTENSIONS
folder by the FoxPro installer:

<UL><LI>MACIMP.MLB
<LI>RESERVED.MLB
<LI>FOXDOC.MLB
<LI>FOXTOOLS.MLB
<P>
</UL>ASLM will not load in System 7.0.1 with Tuneup 1.1.1 if AppleTalk(R)
is turned off. To load ASLM in this configuration, either turn
AppleTalk on or install System 7.1.
<P>
 
Part 4:  Installing Fonts
 
<P>
To install the fonts shipped with FoxPro:

<OL><P><LI>Close all running applications.
</OL>2. Insert the disk labeled "Fonts."
3. Drag the fonts you want to the icon for the System Folder.
<P>
If fonts in the System Folder have the same names as the fonts you are
installing, the Macintosh system will not allow you to replace them. To
replace these previously installed fonts, drag the old fonts to the trash
and empty it, then install the new fonts. If you do not want to replace the
fonts, you can rename them before installing the new fonts.
<P>
The minimum fonts required to run FoxPro for Macintosh are:

<UL><LI>Geneva 9
<LI>Courier 10
<LI>Monaco 9
<P>
</UL>FoxFont is required to run .DBF-style Help or to run a FoxPro for MS-DOS(R)
application on the Macintosh without transporting. FoxPro defines the 9-
point FoxFont. All other FoxFont sizes are mapped by the Macintosh system
and may not appear correctly.
<P>
 
Part 5:  Notes About FoxPro for Macintosh
 
This section includes information about:
<P>
FoxPro Filename Restrictions
FoxPro Color Sets
Displaying Scroll Bars
Displaying Wallpaper Graphic Files
Displaying the FoxPro Graphical Help File
Addition to the SET PRINTER Command
Change to the ON KEY LABEL Command
Using Dual Monitors
<P>
 
FoxPro Filename Restrictions
<P>
Do not use backslashes (\) or quotation marks (") as embedded
characters in folder and filenames. Although the Macintosh accepts
backslashes and quotation marks as valid characters, FoxPro uses these
characters to make filenames compatible across platforms.
<P>
 
FoxPro Color Sets
<P>
In FoxPro for Macintosh, commands that save or call color sets (CREATE
COLOR SET and SET COLOR SET) are ignored. Color sets in FoxPro for
Macintosh are determined by the Macintosh system settings. If you
issue the SET COLOR SET TO command, FoxPro restores the default
Macintosh color set.
<P>
To change the color settings of FoxPro for Macintosh at startup,
include the command COLOR OF SCHEME in CONFIG.FPM, as follows:
<P>
<PRE>    COLOR OF SCHEME &lt;expN&gt; = &lt;ColorPairList&gt;

</PRE></OL>Color schemes set in the CONFIG.FPM override the default Macintosh
color set at the startup of FoxPro. For more information about color
schemes, see Chapter 4, "Configuring FoxPro for Macintosh," in the
Installation and Macintosh Features Guide.
<P>
 
Displaying Scroll Bars
<P>
If you want to display scroll bars along an editing region on a FoxPro
screen, the editing region must have a height greater than five lines
of text. Because FoxPro uses the Macintosh system to define scroll
bars, scroll bars cannot be displayed with smaller editing regions.
<P>
 
Displaying Wallpaper Graphic Files
<P>
Graphic files used as wallpaper on a FoxPro screen must have an
extension in their filenames, such as MYPICT.PIC. If the filename
does not have an extension, FoxPro will ask for the location of the
file each time the screen is run.
<P>
 
Displaying the FoxPro Graphical Help File
<P>
The FoxPro graphical Help file may not be able to display on a system
with 8 megabytes (MB) of memory. If you have trouble displaying the
graphical Help file, issue the following in the Command window:
<P>
<PRE>    SET HELP TO foxhelp.dbf

</PRE>This command brings up the .DBF-style Help file.
<P>
 
Addition to the SET PRINTER Command
<P>
The SET PRINTER command includes the following clause:
<P>
[FONT &lt;expC&gt;, [&lt;expN&gt;]]
<P>
Include the FONT clause to specify a default printer font for ?, ??
and @ ... SAY output directed to a printer.
<P>
Specify the font with the character expression &lt;expC&gt;, and the font
size with the numeric expression &lt;expN&gt;.
<P>
 
Change to the ON KEY LABEL Command
<P>
FoxPro for Macintosh does not support the RIGHTMOUSE clause in the ON
KEY LABEL command.
<P>
 
Using Dual Monitors
<P>
If you drag a window from a color monitor to a monochrome monitor, the
screen controls may have display problems.
<P>
 
Part 6:  Cross-Platform Considerations
 
This section includes information about:
<P>
Updating Cross-Platform Files
Sorting International Characters
Transporting Reports to FoxPro for Windows(TM) and MS-DOS
Converting PICT Files to BMP Files
Displaying OLE Graphics in FoxPro for Windows
Opening Excel OLE Objects in FoxPro for Windows
<P>
 
Updating Cross-Platform Files
<P>
To develop applications for other platforms, or to transport
applications, you need to update certain files for each of the
platforms you work on. If you use FoxPro for Windows (version 2.5a and
2.5b) or FoxPro for MS-DOS (version 2.5a and 2.5b), copy the following
files supplied with FoxPro for Macintosh to these platforms. Do not
copy these files to earlier versions of FoxPro, or you may get
unexpected results.

<UL><LI>GENSCRN.PRG
<LI>GENMENU.PRG
<LI>TRANSPRT.PRG
<P>
</UL> 
Sorting International Characters
<P>
If you are creating a cross-platform application in FoxPro for Macintosh
for an international audience, and you are porting the application to
another platform, use the following steps. International character sorting
is only available for versions 2.5a and later.

<OL><P><LI>Copy the FOXPRO.INT file supplied with FoxPro for Macintosh to FoxPro to
   the other platform.

<P><LI>Include the following line in the FoxPro for MS-DOS or FoxPro for
   Windows configuration file:
<P>
<P><PRE>      CODE PAGE = AUTO
</PRE><P>
</OL>This ensures that ASCII characters representing international characters
are recognized by your applications on the MS-DOS and Windows platforms,
and enables the platforms to support the Macintosh code page.
<P>
 
Transporting Reports to FoxPro for Windows and MS-DOS
<P>
Reports developed on the FoxPro for Macintosh platform must be
transported before you can run them in FoxPro for Windows or FoxPro
for MS-DOS. If you use the REPORT FORM TO command to run an
untransported Macintosh report in Windows, FoxPro displays a message
instructing you to transport the report before running it. In FoxPro
for MS-DOS the message reads, "No records found for this platform."
<P>
 
Converting PICT Files to BMP Files
<P>
You can convert Macintosh PICT images to Windows bitmap files with
"PICT to BMP," a simple stand-alone application shipped with FoxPro
for Macintosh. "PICT to BMP" is located in the GOODIES:MISC folder.
For information about using this application, see the topic Converting
PICT Files to BMP Files in online Help.
<P>
 
Displaying OLE Graphics in FoxPro for Windows
<P>
Macintosh general fields with embedded or linked OLE objects appear
blank when opened in FoxPro for Windows. This is because FoxPro for
Windows cannot display the PICT files used by FoxPro for Macintosh.
To display the OLE graphic, double-click on the general field to edit
the OLE object. This updates the OLE graphic with a Windows bitmap.
<P>
 
Opening Excel OLE Objects in FoxPro for Windows
<P>
Embedded or linked Excel objects created in FoxPro for Macintosh do
not work in FoxPro for Windows. If, in FoxPro for Windows, you try to
connect to an Excel object created or modified in FoxPro for
Macintosh, you will get the error message "Cannot activate OLE
server." To connect to Excel objects you must re-create the link.
<P>
 
Part 7:  Working with FoxPro Text Files
 
This section includes information about:
<P>
Removing Line Feeds from Text Files
Redirecting Printing to a PostScript(R) File
Sending a File to a Port
Changing Paper Sizes for the ImageWriter(R)
Using the COPY TO Command
<P>
 
Removing Line Feeds from Text Files
<P>
FoxPro for Macintosh normally saves text files and programs with line
feeds as well as carriage returns. This can cause problems when you
copy files to other Macintosh editing programs.
<P>
To remove line feeds from previously created text files, use
FXSTRIPLF, a program included with the FoxTools library. The FoxTools
file, called FOXTOOLS.MLB is located in the EXTENSIONS folder. For
information about using FoxTools, see the FoxTools Readme file located
in the GOODIES:MISC folder.
<P>
To edit a text file without adding line feeds, clear the check box
labeled "Save Text with Line Feeds" in the Edit Preferences dialog.
<P>
 
Redirecting Printing to a PostScript File
<P>
To redirect a printing job from a printer that supports PostScript to
a PostScript file, issue the following command:
<P>
<PRE>   LIST FILE &lt;filename&gt; TO PRINT PROMPT

</PRE></OL>The Print dialog appears with the option to select a PostScript file
as a destination.
<P>
 
Sending a File to a Port
<P>
If you send a text file or a program to a port (COM1 or COM2), you
must save your file with the end-of-file character, Ctrl-Z. This
ensures that FoxPro can find the end of your document. If you do not
include the end-of-file character, FoxPro will not print the last line
of your document. To save the file with the end-of-file character,
check the box labeled "Save Text With Ctrl-Z" in the Edit Preferences
dialog.
<P>
You can print only character-based documents directly to a port. To
print graphics files, such as a FoxPro report, you must use the
printer driver. To reset the printer to use the printer driver
selected with the Macintosh Chooser, issue the following command:
<P>
<PRE>   SET PRINTER TO

</PRE> 
Changing Paper Sizes for the ImageWriter
<P>
To change paper sizes for an ImageWriter printer, you need to adjust
the FoxPro for Macintosh resource file. Information about paper sizes
is stored in the PREC resource of FoxPro and is accessed through the
Page Setup dialog.
<P>
Custom page sizes are not available with all printer drivers. For
instance, you cannot change the paper size used by a LaserWriter(R).
<P>
To add a custom paper size option to the Page Setup dialog, follow
these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Quit FoxPro for Macintosh.
</OL>2. Open FoxPro for Macintosh in a resource editor.
3. Open the PREC resource.
4. Open the ID number 4.
5. In the field labeled "Number of Btns," change the number from 5 to 6.
6. In the fields labeled "Btn 6 Height" and "Btn 6 Width," enter the height
<PRE>   and width of the new paper size. Each number represents 1/120th of an
   inch. For example, an 8 1/2-by-11-inch paper size has a height of 1320
   and a width of 1020.
</PRE></OL>7. In the field labeled "Btn 6 Name," add a descriptive name to appear next
<PRE>   to the button.
</PRE>8. Save your changes and exit the resource editor.
<P>
To use the custom paper size option:

<OL><P><LI>Select an ImageWriter printer with the Macintosh Chooser.
</OL>2. Start FoxPro.
3. From the File menu, select Page Setup.
4. Choose the custom paper size.
<P>
FoxPro adds a 1/2-inch margin at the top of all documents printed with
an ImageWriter. To remove the margin, check the box labeled "No Gaps
Between Pages" in the Page Setup dialog.
<P>
 
Using the COPY TO Command
<P>
If you use the COPY TO command to transfer the records of a table to a
text file, the records are separated by single line feeds, chr(10).
Records should be separated by a carriage return, chr(13). To replace
the line feeds with carriage returns, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>With the FoxPro editor, open the text file.

<P><LI>From the Edit menu, choose Preferences.

<P><LI>Clear the check box labeled "Save Text With Line Feeds."

<P><LI>Save the text file.
<P>
</OL> 
Part 8:  FoxPro and Other Applications
 
This section includes information about:
<P>
Importing 4th Dimension(R), FileMaker(R) Pro and Microsoft Works Files
Changing Color Settings
Using the QuickTime(TM) Extension
Using the XCMD Header File
FoxPro and Gregg's Buttons
FoxPro and QuickKeys
FoxPro and the Radius(TM) Pivot Monitor
FoxPro and Network Systems
FoxPro and Accelerator Cards
<P>
 
Importing 4th Dimension, FileMaker Pro and Microsoft Works Files
<P>
You can import files created by the following programs to FoxPro for
Macintosh using an application called IMPORT.APP. IMPORT.APP is
located in the GOODIES:MISC folder.

<UL><LI>4th Dimension version 3.0
<LI>FileMaker Pro version 2.1
<LI>Microsoft Works
<P>
</UL> 
Changing Color Settings
<P>
FoxPro for Macintosh supports both black-and-white and color settings.
However, FoxPro for Macintosh does not recognize changes to color
settings made by third-party utilities while FoxPro is running. To
make FoxPro recognize changes in color settings made by third-party
utilities, you must exit and re-start FoxPro. This ensures that any
objects you create in FoxPro are saved in the correct color setting.
<P>
 
Using the QuickTime Extension
<P>
You can use the QuickTime extension of Macintosh System 7.1 to access
and control time-based data such as video and audio recordings. FoxPro
for Macintosh uses the latest version of the QuickTime extension,
version 1.6.1. Earlier versions may cause unexpected results.
<P>
For information about using QuickTime with FoxPro, see the topic
QuickTime in online Help.
<P>
 
Using the XCMD Header File
<P>
To call FoxPro for Macintosh from an XCMD you need to add a reference
to the FoxPro header file to the XCMD, as follows:
<P>
<PRE>    #INCLUDE xcmd.h

</PRE></OL>The FoxPro XCMD header file, XCMD.H, is located in the GOODIES:MISC
folder.
<P>
 
FoxPro and Gregg's Buttons
<P>
Some font and color changes made with Gregg's Buttons cause display
problems in FoxPro for Macintosh.
<P>
 
FoxPro and QuickKeys
<P>
If you are using QuickKeys, pressing F1 does not bring up FoxPro Help.
To bring up the Help file while using QuickKeys, press Command + ? or
type HELP in the Command window.
<P>
 
FoxPro and the Radius Pivot Monitor
<P>
If you are using a Radius Pivot monitor, you must change the
orientation of the monitor before starting FoxPro. The windows and
status bar of FoxPro are not updated properly if you change monitor
orientation while FoxPro is running.
<P>
 
FoxPro and Network Systems
<P>
Some FoxPro users might experience unexpected results when using
unsupported network software to share files. For example:
<P>
On DEC(R) Pathworks(TM) systems, the file locking mechanism is not
synchronized across multiple platforms. If a Windows workstation is
accessing a shared file on the Pathworks server, Macintosh
workstations might receive a "File in use by another" message. This
message will not appear if only Macintosh workstations (or only
Windows workstations) are accessing the file.
<P>
On Banyan(R) VINES(R) systems, updating a table with SET EXCLUSIVE OFF
has unpredictable results. Use EXCLUSIVE access to ensure that
updates work.
<P>
In addition, Microsoft Windows NT(TM) Advanced Server users might
notice that tables set as EXCLUSIVE in FoxPro for Macintosh can still
be set as SHARED in FoxPro for Windows. This problem is being
addressed with NT Service Pack 2.
<P>
 
FoxPro and Accelerator Cards
<P>
We have identified compatibility issues with the following accelerator
cards:
<P>
Mobius Accelerator on SE/30 machines
Daystar Accelerator Turbo 040 on a IIfx machine
<P>
Contact your card vendor for additional information.
<P>
 
Part 9:  Other Notes
 
This section includes information about:
<P>
Indexing in the Report and Screen Wizards
Analyzing Large Files with FB+Migrate
<P>
 
Indexing in the Report and Screen Wizards
<P>
If you specify a new sort order in either the Report Wizard or the
Screen Wizard, the Wizard creates a new index. This new index is given
a dynamic index tag name, such as _qkzOpdwwe. If you create an index
based on a similar sort order before running a Wizard, the Wizard will
use the previously created index tag name.
<P>
 
Analyzing Large Files with FB+Migrate
<P>
The Migration Application can take a significant amount of time to
analyze large program files. If you are analyzing a large program you
may want to split your program into smaller files.
<P>
 
Part 10:  Other Readme Files
 
This section includes information about:
<P>
The Q&amp;A Readme File
The FoxTools Readme File
<P>
 
The Q&amp;A Readme File
<P>
You can find answers to commonly asked questions about FoxPro for
Macintosh in the Readme file called Q&amp;A ReadMe. The Q&amp;A Readme file
is located in the folder containing FoxPro.
<P>
 
The FoxTools Readme File
<P>
You can find information about FoxTools, a library that makes
Macintosh system functions available for use by FoxPro, in the file
called FoxTools ReadMe. The FoxTools Readme file is located in the
GOODIES:MISC folder.
