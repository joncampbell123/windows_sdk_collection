<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Below is the complete README.TXT file for the Workgroup Extensions for
FoxPro for Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>WorkGroup Extensions for FoxPro Information</h3>
 
<P>
This file describes important details for using the FOXMAPI.FLL
routines to integrate FoxPro for Windows with Microsoft Mail, and
Microsoft Schedule Plus. You should review the included help file for
technical details on specifics of the functions.
<P>
Before you begin using the FOXMAPI.FLL functions, it is a good idea to
closely review the section entitled "FoxPro Environmental
Considerations" which is also located in the help file.
<P>
The included source code illustrates examples of all 12 MAPI functions
included in the FOXMAPI.FLL library. Most of the calls are made
through a generic program file called MAPILIB.PRG. This file is
intended to be generically used with any of your applications
involving use of the FOXMAPI library. You should feel free to
add/delete/modify this file to suit your own needs. A MAPIERR.PRG file
is also included which is used to handle all errors.
<P>
<P><h3>Setup</h3>
 
<P>
To use the FOXMAPI.FLL routines, you will need the following files:
<P>
<PRE>   FOXMAPI.FLL, MAPI.DLL, SPLUS.DLL, EFORM.DLL

</PRE>The FOXMAPI.FLL file can be installed at a place convenient to your
application needs.
<P>
IMPORTANT: You need to copy the three DLLs to your WINDOWS SYSTEM
directory.
<P>
The MAPILIB and MAPIERR FoxPro PRG files can also be used if you
choose to include them in your applications. Make sure that these as
well as the libraries are in a path where FoxPro can locate them.
<P>
<P><h3>Sample Applications</h3>
 
<P>
The sample programs all access library routines contained in the
MAPILIB program file. You can modify them to your choosing. Be aware,
that the various routines in the MAPILIB return different codes (i.e.,
some are logic, others are character). The sample applications also
use a common logon routine. A global variable "mailsession" is checked
to see if it exists and/or it is an active session (i.e., not equal to
zero). You can run multiple mail sessions piggy backing each other if
you choose (see the help file more details). These sample
applications, however, will use an existing session if it is running.
<P>
The descriptions here give a brief description of what each program
does. You should review the sample code more closely to learn specific
details how the calls are made.
<P>
MAILMENU:
<P>
A simple mailmenu can be added to any FoxPro application by running
the MAILMENU.PRG program. The menu has options to send and read mail
messages. In addition, a FoxPro MAPI help file is included so that you
can reference the MAPI calls as you browse through the source code.
The MAILMENU.PRG program is actually generated code from the
MAILMENU.MNX menu file.
<P>
All 12 MAPI calls are included between the two main programs used in
this sample app (READMAIL.PRG and SENDMAIL.PRG). The majority of the
calls are contained in the READMAIL program which goes through and
polls your messages(inbox). You should review this code closely as it
contains several tricks for successfully handing MS Mail messages in
FoxPro.
<P>
BULK MAILING:
<P>
The bulk mailing program shows a common use of FoxPro and MAPI. You
can create a message which goes out to a list of people contained in a
database for example. This application allows the user to construct
two types of mailings.
<P>
The first is a general listing in which everyone receives the same
exact message. A single message is sent with many addresses attached
to it. The second type is also a mass mailing, but allows for message
personalization with each specific message. This mailing takes more
time since a message is sent for each individual in the listing.
Notice in the code how you can set flags to suppress the MAPI SendNote
dialog as is done in the personalized mailing.
<P>
IMPORTANT: The database files contain names and address aliases which
were used for developing this sample program. Running the program
without modifying these names and addresses will cause name resolution
problems. You should use mail aliases contained in your MS Mail system
if you want to successfully run these samples.
<P>
PROJECT FILE UPDATER (Attach):
<P>
The Updater shows a simple multiuser project manager function. It
allows for developers, each working on specific files of a common
project, to update each other's local projects with current files
through a MAPI message. In addition, a button is provided to poll for
new files which may have been sent by someone.
<P>
This sample program illustrates two MAPI uses. The first, how to send
files to others. The second, how to send a MAPI message which does not
get detected by MS Mail.
<P>
The interface provides a popup of all the developers working on the
project. The developer names and files they are working with are
located in two databases. Being a developer, you would select your
name from the popup. When a name is selected, the names of all files
that person is assigned is placed in a list box. Use the &lt;Move&gt; button
to select files to update.
<P>
The &lt;Mail Files&gt; button creates a message with only the updated files.
No text is added to the message. For purposes of identifying these
mail messages, the subject field is stamped with 'Project Files' and
messagetype field is stamped as 'IPC.ProjectUpdater'. The IPC type
will not be detected by the MS Mail client (it will not appear in the
Inbox).
<P>
The &lt;Receive Files&gt; button polls through mail looking for files
stamped with a type "IPC.ProjectUpdater" and subject "Project Files".
A cursor database is created showing a list of these files. Note:
Files are not actually updated (i.e., overwritten) in the sample
program.
<P>
IMPORTANT: The database files contain names and address aliases which
were used for developing this sample program. Running the program
without modifying these names and addresses will cause name resolution
problems. You should use mail aliases contained in your MS Mail system
if you want to successfully run these samples.
<P>
<P><h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
 
<P>
The FoxPro MAPI sample files are distributed solely to provide
examples and guidelines for using the FOXMAPI library calls.
Microsoft is not responsible for the code contained in any of the
sample files and does not provide support for these files. See the
included Help file for further details and assistance regarding
technical/other support.
<P>
<P><h3>Caution</h3>
 
<P>
If you type a MAPI command into the FoxPro Command Window or use the
keyboard to select a button that calls a MAPI command, and that
particular MAPI command brings up a MS Mail dialogue box (i.e.
MPSendNote) you may find that your mouse cursor disappears. This is a
known problem and is being looked into.
