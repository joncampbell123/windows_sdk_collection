The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
A listbox displaying fields from a table is not refreshed correctly when
the following commands are issued:
<P>
<PRE>   SET FILTER TO &lt;myfilter&gt;

</PRE>Then one of the following two commands:
<P>
<PRE>   ThisForm.Refresh
   ThisForm.List&lt;#&gt;.Refresh

</PRE><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Immediately after issuing the SET FILTER command, issue a SETFOCUS command
to the list box and back again to the object on the form where control
should be. As in the "Steps to Reproduce Behavior" below, in the Click
event of the command buttons, the following lines of code would be used:
<P>
<PRE>  ThisForm.List1.SetFocus       &amp;&amp; sets the focus to the list box
  ThisForm.Command&lt;#&gt;.SetFocus  &amp;&amp; sets the focus back to the button

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
