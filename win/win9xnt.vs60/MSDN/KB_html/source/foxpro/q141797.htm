</PRE><h2>INTRODUCTION TO FW1223</h2>
 
<P>
A builder is a tool provided by Visual FoxPro for Windows to assist users
in the design of objects. The tool presents a series of choices that set
properties used in building an object. A builder allows you to quickly
design a form by simplifying the process of setting properties for
controls. A builder is similar in concept to a Wizard. Both are essential
components of Rapid Application Development (RAD), but they differ in their
implementation. The goal of a Wizard is to take you step by step through a
process to accomplish a common task, whereas a builder lets you adjust the
attributes of existing objects at design time.
<P>
Visual FoxPro ships with 10 predefined builders: the Edit Box builder, the
Option Group builder, the List Box builder, the Grid builder, the Form
builder, the Combo Box builder, the Command Group builder, the AutoFormat
builder, the Text Box builder, and the Referential Integrity builder. You
can call a builder interactively from the shortcut menu in the Form
Designer or the Visual Class designer, the Builder button in the Property
sheet, or the Builder Lock button in the Form Control toolbar. You can also
call the builder from the Command window with a DO command. To set
preferences for the Builder Lock button, click the Forms tab in the Options
dialog box.
<P>
In addition to providing these existing builders, Visual FoxPro offers an
open architecture that allows a developer to register and develop new
custom builders.
