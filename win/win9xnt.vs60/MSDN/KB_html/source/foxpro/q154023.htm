The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b
<LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.6, 2.6a
<LI>Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS, versions 2.6, 2.6a
</UL>

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The following error occurs when running a form containing Structured Query
Language (SQL) code:
<P>
<PRE>   "Error Loading File - Loading Form or the Data Environment - Record
   number 44.  Cannot Nest Aggregate Functions".

</PRE>The record number that the error is referring to is always the FORM itself.
In other words, the CLASS field contains 'FORM' and OBJECTNAME = 'FORM1'.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The cause of this problem is related to the way FoxPro internally parses
the SQL code. The code is parsed and assigned an internal number. The
number assigned is entirely dependent on the code itself and the order it
is being generated in. In this case, the number generated is similar to the
token for the SQL aggregate count; thus, FoxPro thinks that it has been
nested.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
The workaround is to change the order of the code. This can be accomplished
in several different ways, depending on the code itself. For example, if
User Defined Functions (UDFs)are being used by the code, they could be
moved to another procedure. If IIF statements are being used, those could
be moved to a .PRG file and then called as UDFs. Both of these will change
the order in which the code is being parsed and will result in a different
generated number. Since there are only a few numbers out of millions that
may conflict, the chances of ever seeing the error again are very slim.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem has been fixed in
Visual FoxPro 5.0 for Windows.
