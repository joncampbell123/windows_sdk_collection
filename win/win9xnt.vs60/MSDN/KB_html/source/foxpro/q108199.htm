The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, version 2.5b
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
After you have used the FB+ Migration Application (FB+MIGRATE.APP) to
convert a FoxBASE+ for the Macintosh screen to FoxPro for Macintosh, you
must make certain changes to ensure that the FoxPro screen will function
correctly. These changes are necessary because of differences in the
capabilities between the two products.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The scope of changes made will vary based on whether you decide to take
advantage of the expanded capabilities of FoxPro for Macintosh. After you
have made all the changes, regenerate the screen code by choosing Generate
from the Program menu.
<P>
<P><h3>Controls</h3>
 
<P>
Following are some generic changes that should be made to push buttons,
radio buttons, lists, and popups:

<UL><LI>Update the VALID clauses. FoxBASE+/Mac does not allow the use of user-
   defined functions (UDFs) in the VALID clause of controls. Only a single
   numeric value is allowed. FoxPro allows the use of UDF code snippets in
   the VALID clauses of controls.

<LI>Add logic to move through records. Push buttons for the next record, the
   prior record, and other choices may need to be added. For more
   information, refer to the sample screens in the FoxPro for Macintosh
   "Developer's Guide" or examine the code created by the Screen Wizard.

<LI>Repair PICTURE clauses on radio button objects and popups objects
   that have an ending single quotation mark but do not have an opening
   single quotation mark.
<P>
</UL><h3>General Changes</h3>
 
<P>
There are also a number of formatting changes that may be necessary:

<UL><LI>Adjust the position of items within the screen. Due to font differences,
   objects may be placed differently in FoxPro.

<LI>Change the fonts and/or colors of objects.
<P>
</UL><h3>Other</h3>
 
<P>
Check any code snippets for incompatibilities. Refer to Chapter 17,
"Compatibility," of the "Developer's Guide" and FB+MIGRATE.APP for
information on code-compatibility issues.
