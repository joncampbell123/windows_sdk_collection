The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 5.0
<LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5, 2.5a, 2.5b
<LI>Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS, versions 2.5, 2.5a, 2.5b
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Mainframe workstation software that maps drives D and E to hold them for
future use when using emulation will cause the following error message to
appear when a disk drive cannot be read:
<P>
<PRE>   Cannot read from drive &lt;drive letter&gt;.

</PRE>Use of the MS-DOS Interlnk program and the INTERSVR command is also a
source of this message. Interlnk's drive mapping redirects the client
system's drives to the next available drive letters of the server. If
INTERLNK.EXE is loaded in the CONFIG.SYS file of the client and the server
PC is then disconnected, FoxPro will be told that sequential drive mapping
exists, when, in fact, there will be no response when FoxPro checks the
drives in sequence that were on the connected PC.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Some FoxPro operations appear to scan all consecutive disk drives.
<P>
The following operations have been reported to cause this error on
computers with a drive that cannot be read:

<UL><LI>Running an executable file (.EXE) created by the FoxPro Distribution
   Kit.

<LI>Opening a project whose home directory points to a drive that cannot be
   read.

<LI>Setting a printer driver in FoxPro for MS-DOS.
<P>
</UL><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Reassign the drive letter of the device that cannot be read so that it is
not in consecutive order with the other drives.
<P>
For example, if drive C is a hard disk drive, and drive D is a CD-ROM drive
that causes the error message when it does not contain a disc, reassign the
CD-ROM drive letter to drive Z.
<P>
You may need to either consult the manual for your CD-ROM drive or use the
MS-DOS SUBST command.
<P>
NOTE: Reassigning the drive letter may require the use of the
LASTDRIVE=&lt;drive letter&gt; command in the CONFIG.SYS file.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following hardware configurations may cause a disk drive to report that
it cannot be read:

<UL><LI>A laptop computer does not have a floppy drive A or B.
<LI>A CD-ROM drive does not contain a disc.
<LI>A removable hard disk drive does not contain a hard disk.
<P></UL>
