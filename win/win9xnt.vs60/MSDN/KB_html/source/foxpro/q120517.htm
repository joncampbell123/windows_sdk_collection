The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5, 2.5a, 2.5b, 2.6, 2.6a
</UL>

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When creating a report in the FoxPro Windows report writer, you may not be
able to close up a report band if there are any phantom spaces left
anywhere within a band region.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
If you place a text literal on any band and then backspace over that text
without first selecting and then deleting it, a phantom space may be left
behind, preventing the band from being closed up any further. Attempting to
close the band up further, only blinks the band you are trying to close.
The band remains fixed in the same location.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Because the space is an invisible character, you will not be able to point
at it to delete it. Instead, you must click the Arrow Tool, drag out the
rubber band to encompass the region where the space is, and then press the
DELETE key. You should then be able to close up the band.
<P>

<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>From the File menu on the FoxPro main menu, choose New. Select Report,
   and choose the New button.

<P><LI>Click the Text Tool, and in the detail band, type in the word TEST plus
   one additional space. Close up the detail band until it is touching the
   bottom of the word TEST. When you reach the bottom of the text object,
   the detail band will blink rapidly. Click the end of the word TEST to
   place the cursor right after the last T. Then backspace over the word
   until it is deleted. Now, click the button at the far left of the detail
   band, and try to close the band. It should blink, indicating that
   it is closed as far as it can be. This is because there is still a
   Chr(32) -- phantom space -- left behind.
