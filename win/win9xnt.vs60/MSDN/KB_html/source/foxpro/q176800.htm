<P>
On a SCO UNIX server using SCO NFS to access files from other SCO UNIX
servers, FoxPro is unable to access files across the servers and produces
the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>     File is in use by another.

</PRE><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Here are two possible workarounds:
<P>

<UL><LI>Make sure that the server accessing the file and the server that has
   the file both have the same Domain name.
<P>
 -or-

<LI>Make sure that the SCO NFS parameter NFSD is set to '-u16'.
<P>
</UL>NOTE: Microsoft does not support, endorse, or recommend SCO NFS. We provide

<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
With FoxPro for UNIX if you try to access a file from a SCO UNIX server
other than the one where FoxPro is installed, you may receive this error:
<P>
<PRE>     File is in use by another.

</PRE>This problem can be resolved by changing settings at the SCO NFS level, as
described in the RESOLUTION section of this article.
