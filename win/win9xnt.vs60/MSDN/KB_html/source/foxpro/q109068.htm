<P>
NOTE: You must use a utility such as PC Exchange or Apple File Exchange in
order to transfer Macintosh files to and from an MS-DOS formatted floppy
disk. PC Exchange is available with System version 7.1.2. Apple File
Exchange was available with versions of the Macintosh system.

<OL><P><LI> Q. Can I run my FoxPro for MS-DOS and FoxPro for Windows
<P><PRE>       applications with FoxPro for Macintosh?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. FoxPro version 2.5 is designed to be a cross-platform product. Aside
       from platform-specific features, the command set in FoxPro for
       Macintosh is identical to the command sets of FoxPro for MS-DOS
       and FoxPro for Windows. All objects (databases, screens,
       reports, labels, menus, projects, queries, and so on) created
       in FoxPro version 2.5 can be transported, edited, and run between
       the Macintosh, MS-DOS, Microsoft Windows, and eventually, UNIX
       platforms. When you open an object created with FoxPro version 2.5
       on one platform with FoxPro version 2.5 on another platform, FoxPro
       invokes a transport program, which asks if you would like to
       convert the object to the current platform.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. Will my FoxBASE+(R) for the Macintosh application run in
<P><PRE>       FoxPro for Macintosh?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. It is unlikely that your FoxBASE+/Mac application will run
       unmodified under FoxPro for Macintosh. The command set of
       FoxPro has evolved significantly since FoxBASE(R) was
       developed. To ease the burden of converting to FoxPro for
       Macintosh, we have provided FB+MIGRATE.APP, a utility that can
       be used to 1) convert your FoxBASE+/Mac screens and reports for
       editing in FoxPro for Macintosh, and 2) analyze your
       FoxBASE+/Mac programs, flag FoxBASE+/Mac commands that are no
       longer supported in FoxPro for Macintosh, and suggest
       alternative commands that produce similar results in FoxPro for
       Macintosh.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. What are the advantages of using FoxPro for Macintosh over
<P><PRE>       FoxBASE+/Mac?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. There are two main advantages to using FoxPro for Macintosh
       over FoxBASE+/Mac. First, FoxPro for Macintosh is a much more
       powerful database development environment than FoxBASE+/Mac.
       The FoxPro Menu Builder, Project Manager, Screen Builder, and
       Report Writer simplify application development and increase
       developer productivity. FoxPro's Relational Query By Example
       (RQBE) tool provides a user interface to simplify data
       retrieval and opens the door to the significant performance
       gains available through Rushmore(TM) technology. Second, FoxPro
       for Macintosh programs and objects are more compatible with
       FoxPro for MS-DOS and FoxPro for Windows than ever before.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. What are the disadvantages of upgrading to FoxPro for
<P><PRE>       Macintosh?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. The two main disadvantages of upgrading to FoxPro for Macintosh
       are higher system requirements and conversion
       adjustments. Since FoxPro for Macintosh is more powerful
       and complex than FoxBASE+/Mac, it requires a more powerful
       machine to run. The following table illustrates the differences
       in system requirements between FoxBASE+/Mac and FoxPro for
       Macintosh.
</PRE><P>
<PRE>System component       FoxBASE+/Mac requires  FoxPro for Mac requires
</PRE></OL> 
<PRE>Microprocessor         68000 or higher        68020 or higher
System software        System 4.2 or later    System 7.0 or later
Memory (RAM)           2 MB                   4 MB (8 MB recommended)
Available disk space   At least 3 MB          At least 10 MB

       The second main disadvantage is that FoxPro for Macintosh is
       not completely backward compatible with FoxBASE+/Mac
       applications. However, the FB+MIGRATE.APP utility does simplify
       conversion. The combination of FoxPro's performance,
       flexibility, and additional development tools should make the
       conversion worthwhile.

</PRE><P><LI> Q. Why doesn't the ? FULLPATH(CURDIR(&lt;volume&gt;)) command
<P><PRE>       behave the same on the Macintosh as it does on the MS-DOS and
       Windows platforms?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. The Macintosh doesn't treat volumes (a volume is the name of a
       hard disk) the same way MS-DOS does. When you use the SET
       DEFAULT command to change directories on a particular volume in
       MS-DOS, this information is saved even when you move to a
       different volume. Any reference to one volume from another
       volume actually refers to the subdirectory last pointed to on
       that volume. On the Macintosh, when you move from volume to
       volume, your location within the hierarchy of a volume other
       than the one pointed to isn't maintained by the system; thus,
       the ? FULLPATH(CURDIR(&lt;volume&gt;)) command returns only the fully
       qualified path of the volume to which you are currently
       pointing.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. How are paths represented on the Macintosh?
<P>
<P><PRE>    A. On the Macintosh, volume and folder names, which make up a
       fully qualified path, are normally delimited by colons (:). In
       FoxPro for Macintosh, you can use the MS-DOS path conventions
       to ensure cross-platform compatibility. For example,
       "shiatsu:foxpro:tutorial" can be represented as
       "shiatsu:\foxpro\tutorial."
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. Macintosh volume names, which are up to 27 characters
<P><PRE>       long, can be somewhat cumbersome. Is there any way I can
       abbreviate them?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. In addition to 27-character volume (hard disk) names, folders
       and files can have names up to 31 characters long. To
       facilitate cross-platform compatibility with the MS-DOS and
       Windows environments, FoxPro for Macintosh includes a SET
       VOLUME command, which allows you to abbreviate the names of
       volumes by using a single letter. Path names that consist of a
       volume name and one or more folders can also be abbreviated
       with a single letter. See the FoxPro "Language Reference" or
       online help system for more information about the SET VOLUME
       command.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. Will applications I built using TrueType(R) fonts look
<P><PRE>       okay on the Macintosh?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. Yes. TrueType, a technology originally developed by Apple(R)
       and licensed to Microsoft to bridge the gap between the
       Macintosh and Windows environments, is incorporated into the
       System 7 architecture. The Setup disks that come with FoxPro
       for Macintosh include several TrueType fonts for the Macintosh
       that are commonly used by developers in the Windows
       environment.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. What happened to the Filer, Calendar, Puzzle, and
<P><PRE>       Calculator items found on the System menu in FoxPro for MS-DOS?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. The System menu in FoxPro for MS-DOS was largely included to
       emulate the Apple menu on the Macintosh. However, in the
       Macintosh and Windows environments, these tools are largely
       redundant, since they are incorporated as desk accessories on
       the Macintosh and as applications (with the exception of the
       Puzzle) in Windows. For cross-platform compatibility, you can
       access the native FoxPro utilities from the Command window.
