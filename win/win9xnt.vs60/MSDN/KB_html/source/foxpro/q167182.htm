The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5, 2.5a, 2.5b, 2.6, 2.6a
   on the following platforms: NT, Win95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Issuing the SET LIBRARY TO HOME()+"FPSQL.FLL" command in FoxPro for Windows
and then checking to see what library is loaded shows that Fpsql.fxp is the
library that is loaded. In other words, the FLL compiles into an FXP file.
<P>
In Windows NT, the message "Cannot find ODBC.DLL" may appear.
<P>
In FoxPro for Windows 2.5x, the message "Library file is invalid" may be
displayed along with the above message.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This is caused by a missing DLL file. Usually the missing DLL file is
Odbc.dll but sometimes the FLL could compile if another required DLL is
missing from the Windows\System folder.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Make sure the Odbc.dll file is located in the Windows\System folder if
using Windows 95 or Windows 3.x. If using Windows NT, the Odbc.dll file
should be in the WinNT\System folder rather than the WinNT\System32 folder.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design. An FLL cannot be loaded if all of the DLLs that
it depends on do not exist.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Fpsql.fll and Odbc.dll files are provided with the FoxPro Connectivity
Kit. The Fpsql.fll is on Disk 1 along with the CKSample.app and some other
files. It is not a compressed file so it can be copied directly from the
disk. The Odbc.dll is on the ODBC Setup disk. It is a compressed file so
setup for ODBC should be run to install it.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Copy the Fpsql.fll file from the FoxPro for Windows Connectivity Kit
   disK #1 if it isn't already in the FoxPro folder.

<P><LI>Verify that the Odbc.dll is not in the Windows\System folder.

<P><LI>In the FoxPro Command window issue the following commands:
<P>
<P><PRE>      SET LIBRARY TO HOME()+"fpsql.fll"
      ? SET("library")
</PRE><P>
   The path of the FoxPro folder followed by Fpsql.fxp should be displayed
   on the FoxPro desktop. The DISPLAY STATUS command also showS if the
   Fpsql.fll file loads as a library or has compiled.
