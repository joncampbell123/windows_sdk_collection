<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The FormCount property of a form set should hold the number of forms in the
form set. However, the FormCount property does not include any toolbars
that are contained in the form set.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Use the Forms array property to identify forms or toolbars in a form set.
It is automatically created when the form set is run.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem has been fixed in
Visual FoxPro 5.0 for Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Steps to Reproduce Problem
 

<OL><P><LI>Create a toolbar class for the form. On the File menu, click New. Select
   the Class option, and click the New File button. In the Class Name box,
   type MyToolbar. In the Based On list, click Toolbar. In the Stored In
   box, type Mytool. Click OK, and the Class Designer form appears.

<P><LI>Click the command button object in the Forms Controls toolbar, and then
   click the empty area of the toolbar located in the upper-left corner of
   the Class Designer. A small command button appears. Type the word Quit
   as the caption, and resize the command button to allow the word Quit to
   appear in full view. Double-click it, and add the following line of code
   to its Click event procedure. Save and close the Class Designer.
<P>
   THISFORMSET.RELEASE

<P><LI>Create a new form. On the File menu, click New. Select the Form option,
   and click the New File button. On the Form menu, click Create Form Set.
   Then on the Form menu, click Add New Form to place a second form in the
   form set.

<P><LI>Add a text box (Text1) to the form set, and type the following in the
   ControlSource property for the Text1 box:
<P>
   ThisFormSet.FormCount
<P>
   FormCount is a property of the form set that tells how many forms are in
   the form set.

<P><LI>Add a command button to the form set and place the following code in the
   command button's Click event procedure:
<P>
   FOR X= 1 TO THISFORMSET.FORMCOUNT
<P><PRE>      WAIT WINDOW MYFORM.FORMS(X).NAME
</PRE>   ENDFOR

<P><LI>Add another command button to the form set and place the following code
   in its click event procedure:
<P>
   WAIT WINDOW MYFORM.FORMS(1).NAME
   WAIT WINDOW MYFORM.FORMS(2).NAME
   WAIT WINDOW MYFORM.FORMS(3).NAME

<P><LI>Click the View Classes tool in the Forms Controls toolbar. Then click
   Add, and select the Mytool.vcx file. The custom tool MyToolbar now
   appears in the Forms Controls toolbar replacing the objects that usually
   appear there. Click MyToolbar, and then click the form. The toolbar with
   the Quit command button appears in the form set.

<P><LI>Save the form as MyForm, and run it. Note the value shown in Text1 is 2.
   There are two forms plus the custom toolbar form, so it should show a
   value of 3. Click the first command button, and notice that the first
   and second wait windows show the names of the forms of the form set
   stored in the Forms array. Click the second command button. Wait windows
   appear with the names of the first and second forms, and the third wait
   window shows the name of the custom toolbar. This name is stored as the
   third element of the Forms array. If the second form had been added
   after the custom toolbar, then clicking the first command button would
   have caused the name of the first form and the name of the toolbar to
   appear. The name of the second form is still in the Forms array, but it
   is located in the third array element instead of the second array
   element. The FormCount property works correctly if no toolbars are added
   to the form set.
