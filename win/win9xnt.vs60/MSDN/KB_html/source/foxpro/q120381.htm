<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you are attempting to run FoxPro from the console, the keyboard may
produce garbage characters. However, running FoxPro using an emulator
package called Unterminal, which emulates the system console in the same
way Sun River does, may work fine.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
If the only difference between the console and Unterminal is that stty -a
shows that cs2scancode was turned on at the console and not the Unterminal,
this behavior may be the result of having set the console keyboard in AT
mode, not XT. If you change the console keyboard to XT mode by using the
kbmode command, the keyboard should operate as expected.
