The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
You are able to use the mouse to select a disabled grid control. The
control appears to have the focus, but no editing can be performed.
<P>
This can occur when:

<UL><LI>A grid column has an Enabled property set to true.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>A control inside the grid column has an Enabled property set to true.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>The When event returns a false.
<P>
</UL>This situation can also arise when you press the UP ARROW or DOWN ARROW key
under either of these ircumstances:

<UL><LI>The column is disabled, and you select a control on the column by using
   the mouse. Then you can use the UP ARROW and DOWN ARROW keys to move the
   focus up and down the disabled column.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>The DynamicCurrentControl property is used to set the current control to
   a disabled control. Then you can use the UP ARROW and DOWN ARROW keys to
   move up or down from the disabled control.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This is normal behavior for the Grid object. This situation occurs because
the Grid object must change the record pointer before it can query columns
or column controls for enabled = true. Once the record pointer is changed,
the grid can't go back because the grid does not save a previous record
pointer.
<P>
It might be argued that the grid should leave the focus on the prior column
before the user switches to the disabled column or control, but this leads
to problems when handling two special cases:

<UL><LI>When the grid is entered for the first time, and there is no prior
   column.

<LI>When DynamicCurrentControl is used and the current control for the
   previous column gets set to a disabled control.
<P>
</UL>In addition, the grid must behave this way to accommodate the following
special case. If all the columns of a grid are disabled and the RecordMark
and DeleteMark properties are set to false, the user needs to have a way to
change the record pointer within the grid.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Include code in the AfterRowColChange event to handle cases in which the
column is being changed to a disabled column or control. Following are two
examples of code to accomplish this.
<P>
<P><h3>Example One</h3>
 
<P>
The following example demonstrates the simplest case. For this example,
assume that column one is always disabled, column two is never disabled,
and horizontal scrolling is disabled.
<P>
<PRE>   LPARAMETERS nColIndex

   * LPARAMETERS statement required and inserted by Visual FoxPro

   * Check to see if you're on column one
   IF nColIndex = 1
       * Change the active cell
       WITH This
           .ActivateCell(.RelativeRow, 2)
       ENDWITH
   ENDIF

</PRE>NOTE: This example makes use of the RelativeRow property. Do not use the
ActiveRow property; it will not work properly. Note that the ActiveCell
method assigns the focus to column two even if column two is disabled or
the current control in column two is disabled.
<P>
<P><h3>Example Two</h3>
 
<P>
The following example is slightly more robust. It can be used on scrollable
grids, where the columns or controls may have a variable enabled setting.
The code first checks to make sure that the current column is valid. If it
is not, it starts moving through the available columns until it finds a
valid column for input focus, and then sets the focus. The code wraps from
the last column to the first, taking into account that several controls may
exist within the column. The code leaves the focus on the current column if
no columns are enabled.
<P>
<PRE>   LPARAMETERS nColIndex

   * LPARAMETERS statement required and inserted by Visual FoxPro

   LOCAL iLoop, iMax, lFocusSet

   WITH This &amp;&amp; Grid

      * Initialize Loop Variables
      iMax = .ColumnCount
      iLoop = nColIndex + 1

      * Check if current column is valid
      WITH .Columns(nColIndex)
         * Column is valid only if the Column's Enabled Property is True
         * and the CurrentControl's Enabled Property is True

         * Note: The EVAL function (cf. EVALUATE() online help) is used as
         * as an alternative to macro substitution for accessing the
         * column's current control

         lFocusSet=.Enabled .AND. EVAL("." + .CurrentControl + ".Enabled")

      ENDWITH

      * Start at next column (to the right) and cycle through all columns
      * until a valid column is reached or loop returns to current column

      * Note: If the current column is valid, lFocusSet = true and this
      * loop is skipped
      DO WHILE iLoop # nColIndex .AND. .NOT. lFocusSet
         * Wrap to first column if necessary
         IF iLoop &gt; iMax
            iLoop = 1
         ELSE

            WITH .Columns(iLoop)
               * If this column is Valid (same criteria as above)
               IF .Enabled .AND. EVAL("." + .CurrentControl + ".Enabled" )
                  * Set focus to column and end loop
                  .SetFocus
                  lFocusSet = .T.
               ENDIF
            ENDWITH
            * Advance to next column
            iLoop = iLoop + 1
         ENDIF
      ENDDO
   ENDWITH

</PRE>NOTE: This example does not take into account columns or controls within
columns that have a When event that returns False.

<P>
This behavior is by design.
