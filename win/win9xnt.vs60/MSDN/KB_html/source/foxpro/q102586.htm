The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0
<LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5 and 2.5a
<LI>Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS, versions 2.0, 2.5, and 2.5a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you are building an application (.APP) from a project that makes
reference to a function or procedure that is contained within another
application, FoxPro is unable to resolve the external reference. The
Build function will display the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Unable to Find Proc./Func. &lt;name&gt;

</PRE><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
At the bottom of the file, create a procedure stub that references the
external function.
<P>
Additional ways to resolve this problem and their advantages and
disadvantages are explained at the end of the "More Information"
section below.
<P>
NOTE: Using the EXTERNAL PROCEDURE &lt;name&gt; compiler directive does not
resolve the problem.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The code example below demonstrates this error. Because the main .APP
file makes reference to a procedure stored in another .APP file, the
Build function is unable to resolve the reference.

<OL><P><LI>Open a new program file. Name it SUBAPP.PRG and include the
   following code:
<P>
<P><PRE>      PROCEDURE MyFunc
      WAIT WINDOW 'Myfunc called.'
</PRE>
<P><LI>Save the program, and include it in a new project named SUBAPP.PJX.
   Save the project, and build an application named SUBAPP.APP.

<P><LI>Create a file named MAINAPP.PRG. Include the following code:
<P>
<P><PRE>      EXTERN PROCEDURE MyFunc
      DO MyFunc IN SubApp.app
</PRE>
<P><LI>Save the program and add it to a new project named MAINAPP.PJX.
   Save the project and build an application named MAINAPP.APP.
<P>
   During the build, as FoxPro is attempting to resolve external
   references, an alert will appear with the following text:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Unable to Find Proc./Func. MYFUNC
      Locate, Ignore, Ignore All, Cancel
</PRE>
<P><LI>In the alert box, choose Locate and choose SUBAPP.APP, which
   contains the procedure MyFunc. FoxPro will add the application as
   an excluded application to the project MainApp and complete the
   build. Run MAINAPP.APP, and the wait window will appear with the
   text "MyFunc called."

<P><LI>Rebuild MAINAPP.PJX. Note that once again the "Unable to Find
   Proc./Func." alert appears. Attempting to locate SUBAPP.APP again
   will add yet another copy of the application as an excluded
   application to the project. You can choose Ignore instead, and
   FoxPro will rebuild MAINAPP.APP without error.
<P>
</OL>You can resolve this problem in one of three ways:

<UL><LI>Choose Ignore when the Locate alert appears every time you rebuild
   your project.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Remove the reference to SUBAPP.APP from the MAINAPP project, pack
   the project, and add a reference to the source program, in this
   case SUBAPP.PRG, which contains the source code for the procedure
   MyFunc.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Add the following code to the end of MAINAPP.PRG:
<P>
<P><PRE>      PROCEDURE MyFunc
</PRE><P>
   This is a procedure stub that helps FoxPro resolve the external
   reference. Since the line of code that actually calls the procedure
   explicitly specifies the file in which the procedure actually
   resides, it is that procedure (in this case, the procedure in
   SUBAPP.APP) which will be called.
<P>
</UL><h3>Notes</h3>
 
<P>
Both the second and the third options will eliminate the problem.
However, while the second option requires the source code to be
available and that it be built into the application, increasing its
size, the third option requires that the entire called application
that includes the single function be sent along with the calling
application. If the source code to the function is not available, and
you would like to avoid the alert box, use the third method.
