<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you are creating screens for multiple platforms and different
screen resolutions, the following guidelines may be helpful.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 

<UL><LI>Design the screen on the MS-DOS platform; you can make it "pretty"
   on the Windows platform. If the screen is going to be used with
   different resolutions, be sure to use the lowest resolution (that
   is, 640 x 480). For example, design the screen in FoxPro for MS-DOS
   if the screen will be used on the MS-DOS and Windows platforms; use
   VGA if the screen will be used with a variety of resolutions on the
   Windows platform.

<LI>Use a monospace font (for example, Courier New) when transporting
   the screen from MS-DOS to Windows. Once the screen has been
   transported, the GETs should remain in the monospace font. The use
   of fonts other than a monospace font should be reserved for the
   SAYs.

<LI>Footers do not exist on the Windows platform. When you transport a
   screen with a footer from MS-DOS, the footer will be removed on the
   Windows side. NOTE: If this screen is then transported back to
   MS-DOS, the footer will not exist on the MS-DOS screen either.

<LI>Moving objects on either platform does not affect their placement
   on the other platform.

<LI>Adding objects or changing an object's properties will cause the
   changes to be reflected in the other platform. Adding objects or
   changing object properties will trigger the transporter when the
   screen is opened on a different platform, and the transporter will
   give you the option of carrying the changes over to this new
   platform.

<LI>When you are working with different resolutions on the Windows
   platform, be careful about using the 1024 large font mode. FoxPro
   bases the row and column coordinates of objects on a screen (and
   therefore much of the placement and sizing) on the current font.
   Choosing large fonts causes Windows to automatically scale the
   selected font size up. However, how Windows does this varies
   according to the particular font selected. For example, FoxFont
   will probably not be scaled because FoxPro provides only two fixed
   sizes. If you have used a variety of fonts in different objects and
   windows, some items may be distorted when the screen is moved
   between different resolutions. To avoid this problem, use only one
   font; if you need to use more fonts, use all TrueType fonts. If you
   use FoxFont, use it exclusively because of its limited point sizes.
