The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5x, 2.6
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Under FoxPro for Windows, an @ ... GET List will not refresh properly after
another window has been called in front of it.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The combination of the following two conditions causes this problem to
occur:

<UL><LI>The @ ... GET LIST items are from table or cursor fields.

<LI>The table or cursor that provides the fields for the @ ... GET LIST
   items is inadvertently closed.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following cases will inadvertently close the original table or cursor:

<UL><LI>The environment of the second screen is saved and is different than the
   current environment.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>When the second window was generated, the Open Files and Close Files
   check boxes in the Generate Screen dialog box were selected.
<P>
   NOTE: You must choose the More button to see these check boxes.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>The second window reissues the SELECT statement, thereby overwriting the
   original cursor.
<P>
</UL><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 
<P>
This is an example of reissuing the SELECT statement in the second window,
thereby overwriting the original cursor.

<OL><P><LI>Create a new screen.

<P><LI>Place the following code in the Setup Code for the screen:
<P>
<P><PRE>      CLOSE ALL
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      CREATE TABLE places (name C(15))
      INSERT INTO places (name) VALUE ("Reading")
      INSERT INTO places (name) VALUE ("London")
      INSERT INTO places (name) VALUE ("Oxford")
      SELECT * FROM places ORDER BY name INTO CURSOR QUERY
</PRE>
<P><LI>Using the List tool, add a list box to the screen, making it at least
   six rows in height.

<P><LI>For List Items, choose From Field and for the field name, type
   "Query.name" (without the quotation marks).

<P><LI>For the variable, type "m.choice" (without the quotation marks).

<P><LI>In the VALID clause, place the following code:
<P>
<P><PRE>      DEFINE WINDOW cover FROM 10,10 TO 20,30 SYSTEM FLOAT
      ACTIVATE WINDOW cover
      @ 3,5 GET m.choice ;
<PRE></PRE>        PICTURE "@*HT Clear" ;
        DEFAULT 1
      READ CYCLE
      RELEASE WINDOW cover
      * (The following SELECT statement closes the original cursor.)
      SELECT * FROM places ORDER BY name INTO CURSOR QUERY
      SHOW GETS

</PRE><P><LI>Generate and run the screen.

<P><LI>Double-click one of the names to activate the window "cover." After
   placing the window over some portion of the list box that is empty,
   choose the Clear push button.

<P><LI>Repeat this step until the problem appears. It may be more likely to
   appear if you select the second or third items in the list box.
<P></OL>
