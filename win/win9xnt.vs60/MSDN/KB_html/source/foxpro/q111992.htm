The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5x, 2.6x
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The Copies box in the Print dialog box allows you to specify the number of
copies of a report or label form to print. With certain printer drivers,
this field is disabled.
<P>
However, if you then start another Windows-based application, such as
Microsoft Excel or Microsoft Word, and activate the Print dialog box for
that application, you will see that the Copies box is enabled.
<P>
The following are some printer drivers that the problem occurs with, but
the list is not exhaustive:
<P>
<PRE>   Epson FX-86e
   Epson LQ-1000
   Epson T-1000
   Epson LQ-2500
   HP DeskJet

</PRE><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
There are two workarounds for this problem:

<UL><LI>If your printer emulates a printer for which the Copies box is enabled,
   use Print Manager to set the default Windows printer driver to that
   printer. Drivers for laser printers appear to work in this situation.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Use a FOR loop to reissue the REPORT FORM or LABEL FORM commands as many
   times as you need copies of the report or label set. For example, if you
   need five copies of the report, STEP3, which was mentioned above, issue
   the following commands:
<P>
<P><PRE>      USE c:\foxprow\tutorial\customer
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      m.printcopy = 5
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      FOR i = 1 TO m.printcopy
<PRE></PRE>         REPORT FORM step3 TO PRINTER
      ENDFOR

   NOTE: You do not need to use the PROMPT clause since you are not using
   the Print dialog box to specify the number of copies.

   NOTE:  If a printer driver that has the Copies box enabled is selected
   and then a printer driver that disables the Copies box is selected,
   reselecting the first printer driver does not re-enable its Copies box.
   You must run the REPORT FORM ... PROMPT command do enable the Copies
   box.

</PRE></UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Use Print Manager to set the default Windows printer driver to one of
   the printer drivers listed above.

<P><LI>Start FoxPro.

<P><LI>In the Command window, issue the following code.
<P>
   NOTE: The following code assumes that you have installed FoxPro on drive
   C and have installed the tutorial files.
<P>
<P><PRE>      USE c:\foxprow\tutorial\customer
      REPORT FORM step3 TO PRINTER PROMPT
</PRE><P>
   The PROMPT clause activates the Print dialog box. Note that the Copies
   box in the lower-right corner of the Print dialog box is disabled.
<P>
   NOTE: This problem also occurs with the LABEL FORM &lt;label_name&gt; TO
   PRINTER PROMPT command.

<P><LI>Choose the Setup button and set the Specific Printer option to a laser
   printer, such as the Hewlett-Packard (HP) LaserJet IIISi.

<P><LI>Choose OK to return to the Print dialog box. The Copies box is still
   disabled. In other words, setting the printer driver to one that would
   normally have the Copies box enabled does not work.
