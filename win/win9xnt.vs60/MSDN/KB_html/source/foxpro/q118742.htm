<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Using FoxPro for Macintosh to import FileMaker Pro data files can cause
several error messages, including "unable to locate data" and "data
dictionary not found."
<P>
This article describes how to troubleshoot these and other problems and
gives several methods of importing FileMaker data into FoxPro for
Macintosh.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Troubleshooting Tips</h3>
 
<P>
All methods of importing FileMaker files, including the use of the APPEND
FROM command, depend on several files being available:

<UL><LI>The file to be appended from (the FileMaker data file)
<LI>MACIMP.APP, located in the FOXPRO:GOODIES:MISC folder
<LI>MACIMP.MLB, located in the System Folder:Extensions folder
<P>
</UL>Make sure these files are located in the specified location. In addition,
make sure that the Apple Shared Library Manager (ASLM) is properly
installed by issuing the following command in the Command window:
<P>
<PRE>   SET LIBRARY TO MACIMP.MLB

</PRE>If the ASLM has not been installed properly, an informative error message
will be displayed. If MACIMP is not in the Extensions folder, the SET
LIBRARY command will return the following error:
<P>
<PRE>   API Library not found

</PRE>If you still cannot import the file, try the following:

<UL><LI>Disable the Macintosh extensions with the exception of the ASLM.

<LI>Try to open FoxPro objects (tables, screens, and so on) in the same
   volume or folder as the FileMaker file to be imported. If FoxPro cannot
   open FoxPro objects in the volume or folder where the FileMaker file is
   located, check for unusual volume or folder names; backslashes and
   hyphens in volume and folder names are unacceptable to FoxPro.
<P>
</UL><h3>Methods of Importing FileMaker Files</h3>
 
<P>
If you have access to FileMaker, the best and easiest solution is to open
the file in FileMaker and export the records in .DBF format. Using this
method solves most data-conversion problems because the .DBF format is
relatively simple compared to FileMaker's native file format. To export the
records, choose Import/Export from FileMaker's File menu. In the Export
Records dialog box, select the .DBF option from the File Type list box.
<P>
If the FileMaker table is a simple one (that is, the basic data types are
used in the structure of the FileMaker table), FoxPro should be able to
APPEND FROM the FileMaker table into an existing FoxPro table structure.
However, if the FileMaker table contains any proprietary field types, such
as calculated or auto-incrementing type fields, FoxPro will NOT be able to
perform the import.
<P>
NOTE: If the FileMaker table has a simple structure, you may want to try
using IMPORT.APP through the Run Application option instead of using APPEND
FROM. IMPORT.APP is the front-end interface to the functionality built into
MACIMP.APP and MACIMP.MLB. Running IMPORT.APP eliminates any possibility of
user error in creating the table structure because IMPORT.APP creates the
FoxPro table automatically.
