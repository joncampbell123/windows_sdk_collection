WINDOWS
kbprg kbfixlist kbbuglist
<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, version 2.5
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The SHOW GETS command does not clear a list box when a SET FILTER
command is used to simulate a parent-child relationship.
<P>
This behavior occurs only when you are moving from a record in the
"parent" database that has a matching "child" record to a parent
record that does not have a matching child record. The list box
displaying the child record should clear, but instead continues to
display the previous values.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in FoxPro 2.5 for
Windows. This problem was corrected in FoxPro 2.5a for Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 
<P>
NOTE: In the following program, a filter is set on the INVOICES
database in order to display the INO field for all INVOICES related to
the current customer.

<OL><P><LI>Create and run a program with the following code:
<P>
<P><PRE>      CREATE TABLE customer (cno C(5), contact C(35))
      CREATE TABLE invoices (ino N(4), cno C(5))
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      INSERT INTO customer (cno, contact) VALUES ;
<PRE></PRE>         ('10000', '1st Computers')
      INSERT INTO customer (cno, contact) VALUES ;
         ('20000', 'A. Arts Computers')
      INSERT INTO customer (cno, contact) VALUES ;
         ('30000', 'Balance Computing Systems')

      INSERT INTO invoices (ino, cno) VALUES ;
         (1111, '10000')
      INSERT INTO invoices (ino, cno) VALUES ;
         (3333, '30000')

      SELECT customer
      GO TOP
      SELECT invoices
      SET FILTER TO invoices.cno = customer.cno
      *   (The filter controls what appears in the list box.)
      SELECT customer

      DEFINE WINDOW test ;
         FROM 0, 0 ;
         TO 10, 60

      DEFINE POPUP lpop ;
         PROMPT FIELD invoices.ino ;
         SCROLL ;
         MARGIN

      ACTIVATE WINDOW test

      @ 1, 1 SAY "Customer# "
      @ 1, 13 GET customer.cno ;
         SIZE 1,5 ;
         DEFAULT " "

      @ 2, 1 SAY "Contact"
      @ 2,13 GET customer.contact ;
         SIZE 1, 35 ;
         DEFAULT " "

      @ 4,30 GET x ;
         PICTURE "@*HN next" ;
         SIZE 2,14,1 ;
         DEFAULT 1 ;
         VALID xval()

      @ 4,7 GET y ;
         PICTURE "@&amp;N" ;
         POPUP lpop ;
         SIZE 4, 15 ;
         DEFAULT " "

      READ CYCLE
      CLEAR ALL

      FUNCTION xval
      SELECT customer
      SKIP
      SELECT invoices
      GO TOP     &amp;&amp; Move record pointer to update filter in INVOICES.
      SHOW GETS  &amp;&amp; This doesn't always properly refresh the list box.

   Note that the first Customer#, "10000," and Contact, "1st
   Computers," are displayed, along with the matching Invoice number,
   "1111," in the list box.

</PRE><P><LI>Choose the Next button. The next Customer#, "20000," and Contact,
   "A. Arts Computers," display, but the invoice number is still
<PRE>   '1111.' The expected behavior is for the list box to clear.

</PRE><P><LI>Choose the Next button again. The last Customer#, "30000," and
   Contact, "Balance Computing Systems," display along with the
   matching invoice number, "3333."
