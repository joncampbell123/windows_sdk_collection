The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In a distributed application, you may need to allow users to modify report
layouts to fit their specific needs. While you can add this functionality,
unless specific steps are taken, it is possible that there will be no
report toolbars available. This article explains how to make the report
toolbars available from within a distributed application.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
There are two methods available to ensure that toolbars are available in
your application. The first requires the Foxuser resource file, and the
second uses menus and system menus.
<P>
<P><h3>Method One</h3>
 
<P>
Toolbar state information is stored in the Foxuser resource file. Whenever
a report is modified or created in the design environment and the report
toolbars are open when that report is saved, the state of the toolbars is
written to the Foxuser file.
<P>
NOTE: The Toolbars submenu is not available until a report in actually
open. If you go to the View menu and try to select Toolbars, it is dimmed
out if nothing is open in modify mode.
<P>
<P>
When you use this method to ensure that report toolbars are available from
within the application, you must meet these conditions:

<UL><LI>You must have modified or created a report in the design environment
   with one or both report toolbars open. You must then save the report.
   This will save the state of the report toolbars.

<LI>The Foxuser resource file must be distributed with your application.

<LI>The resource file must be either built into your application or marked
   as read-only. If it isn't, when the report is modified, the toolbars
   closed, and the report saved, the state of the toolbars will also be
   saved. As a result, because the toolbars are now closed, there is no
   direct way to re-open them from within your application. By marking the
   resource file read-only, if the user should close the toolbars, the
   resource file will not be updated with the new state of "closed."
<P>
</UL><h3>Method Two</h3>
 
<P>
A second and perhaps easier way to achieve the same result involves using
the Visual FoxPro System Menus. The following example shows how to do it:

<OL><P><LI>In the Command window, type:
<P>
   CREATE MENU TESTMENU

<P><LI>For the prompt, type the word "View." The result should be set to
   Submenu.

<P><LI>Click the Options button. The pad name should be _msm_view.

<P><LI>Because the View option takes you to a submenu, you need to click the
   Create button located to the right of the Submenu popup. For the prompt,
   the standard text is "Toolbars."

<P><LI>Set the result to a value of Bar #. The prompt to the right of the words
   Bar # will be _mvi_toolb.

<P><LI>On the View menu, click Menu Options, and name the menu _mview.
<P>
</OL>When you compile the menu, you should have Toolbar functionality in your
application.
