The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, version 2.6a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you make a custom .EXE file or application that uses the FoxPro for
Macintosh Connectivity Kit and run the Setup Wizard to create distribution
floppy disks, a person using the floppy disks to install your application
receives the following error messages and the setup ends:
<P>
<PRE>   System Error!
   Resource not found.

</PRE>Once the OK button is clicked, the first error dialog box is followed by
this message:
<P>
<PRE>   Installation interrupted. Some options may
   be only partially installed.

</PRE>After this message, the setup ends. The last file to be installed is
Fpsql.mlb.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
One of the files included on the floppy disks is the Fpsql.mlb shared
library that the Connectivity Kit uses. The Fpsql.mlb file causes this
problem when it is installed. If this file is not on the distribution
floppy disks, setup proceeds normally.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Copy the Fpsql.mlb file into the application's folder on the target
Macintosh from another separate floppy disk that has an uncompressed copy
of the file on it.
<P>
TIP: Even though the development version of FoxPro for Macintosh looks for
library files (.mlb) in the System:Extensions folder, custom .EXE files and
applications do not seem to be able to find the library files unless they
are in the same folder as the program. The Distribution Kit setup installs
any library files into the System:Extensions folder.
<P>
For more information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : DOCERR: DK Installer Does Not Prompt User To Install ASLM

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Note that the Distribution Kit and Connectivity Kit are only available with
the Professional version of FoxPro version 2.6 for Macintosh.
<P>
For library files (.mlb) to be used by FoxPro or FoxPro applications, the
Apple Shared Library Manager (ASLM) must be installed. A license from Apple
is needed to distribute the ASLM. For information on obtaining this license
from Apple, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../foxpro/q117589.htm">Q117589</A></B>
   TITLE     : ASLM Licensing Information

</PRE><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 
<P>
It is assumed that you have a working knowledge of building applications or
.EXE files in FoxPro and running the Setup Wizard. For more information on
using the Setup Wizard, please see Chapters 1-4 of the Microsoft FoxPro
Distribution Kit for Macintosh "User's Guide" version 2.6.

<OL><P><LI>Create an application or .EXE file in FoxPro. It can be as simple as a
   one line program such as:
<P>
   WAIT WINDOW "Hello World"

<P><LI>Place the application or .EXE file you created in an empty folder, and
   include a copy of the Fpsql.mlb file in this folder. If the Connectivity
   Kit has been installed, the Fpsql.mlb file can be copied from the
   System:Extensions folder.

<P><LI>Run the Setup Wizard to create distribution disks. There is no need
   to include the files for Graphical Help, OLE, or Quicktime. If an
   application (.app) file was built, answer Yes to the question on
   including the support library files.

<P><LI>Copy the disk images to properly labeled disks. Then use them to
   install your .EXE file or application.
<P>
   NOTE: The problem occurs regardless of whether or not FoxPro is already
   installed.

<P><LI>If installing on a Macintosh that already has Fpsql.mlb in the
   System:Extensions folder, remove the Fpsql.mlb file from that location
   prior to installation. Once the installation fails, there will be a
   valid copy of the Fpsql.mlb file in the System:Extensions folder, and
   that copy will be the last file installed. Removing the Fpsql.mlb file
   prior to installation, however, is not necessary to cause the problem.
