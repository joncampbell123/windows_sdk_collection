</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article illustrates some techniques using the Visual FoxPro 3.0
Communications (MSComm) control for receiving and transmitting binary data
over RS-232 cable (without having modems).
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Communications control, MSCOMM32.OCX, provides serial communications
for your application by allowing the transmission and reception of data
through a serial port where only a string of characters to the transmit
buffer is permitted. This feature limits you to transmitting only text-
based files.
<P>
This article demonstrates how to use the MSComm control to transmit and
receive binary data using RS-232 cable. (The techniques in this article
will also work with modems.) The binary data must be converted one byte at
a time to a character and then transmitted. When received, the data must be
converted from a character back into binary data one byte at a time.
<P>
On DBCS-enabled operating systems (running operating system software that
uses one of the double-byte character sets), binary data will be corrupted
if one of the binary values matches a DBCS lead character. The MSComm
control will interpret this byte and the following byte as one double-byte
character and return only one byte for the equivalent ASCII character. To
resolve this problem, you need to convert one byte into ASCII size of three
characters to preserve the lead character.
<P>

The following code illustrates this process:

Property of OleControl1
<P>
RThreshold = 3
<P>
 
<P>
The event-driven technique generates an OnComm event when there are
characters waiting in the input buffer. Also, the CommEvent property will
contain a numeric 2. For the OnComm event to be triggered, you must set the
Rthreshold property to a value other than zero (its default). The most
common setting for the RThreshold property is 1, meaning that the OnComm
event is triggered if a minimum of one character is waiting in the input
buffer. In this article, 3 is being used as a value of RThreshold property
because 3 characters at a time are being sent.
