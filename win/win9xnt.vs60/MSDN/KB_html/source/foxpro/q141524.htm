The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
While you're working with a project that contains a Visual Class Library
and one of the Build Options (Project, Application, or Executable) has been
selected, if the Project Manager encounters a reference to a Visual Class
Library that does not exist in the Project, it will offer the user an
opportunity to locate it. If, during this process, the user locates and
selects the Visual Class Library that already exists in the project, the
Project Manager will permit it to be added a second time.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
If this occurs, one of the two references to the Visual Class Library
should be eliminated by using the Remove option. Care should be taken to
remove the file -- don't delete it from the disk.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create a new project, and add either a new or existing Wizard Form to
   it.

<P><LI>Rebuild the project so that the Wizstyle.vcx Visual Class Library is
   added to the project. If necessary, locate Wizstyle.vcx for the Project
   Manager in the Wizards subdirectory of the FoxPro root directory (for
   example: C:\Vfp\Wizards).

<P><LI>Add either a new or existing form that contains a class from a Visual
   Class Library other than Wizstyle.vcx. Use the View Classes tool of the
   Form Controls toolbar to add the Tsgen.vcx Visual Class Library. From
   Tsgen.vcx, add the DateRange class to the form.

<P><LI>Save and Close the form and return to the Project Manager.

<P><LI>From the Project Manager, select Build, and on the Build Options screen,
   select Project.

<P><LI>When the Locate File dialog box appears with the message, "Unable to
   find Visual Class Library TSGEN," select Locate. Under the same
   directory where Wizstyle.vcx was located, select it by highlighting it
   with the mouse and clicking OK. Note that after the build process has
   completed, Wizstyle.vcx has been added to the Project Manager a second
   time.
