Functional FoxPro, page 14. Saving and Restoring Indexes. By Malcolm C.

International FoxPro, page 29. Handling Text as Data. By Peter Somers.

you how. Parse, Parsing text phrases, eliminating array subscripts, dealing

<P>
FoxPro Tip, page 44. Using ON SHUTDOWN for Automatic Time Out. By Drew
Speedie. The ON SHUTDOWN procedure can provide a global yet graceful way to

determine that termination of a READ / BROWSE resulted from executing a
TIMEOUT clause.
