The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The _CUROBJ system memory variable indicates the number of the currently
active objects in a screen. Because _CUROBJ is active only when a READ is
in effect, this system memory variable does not return any value in a
Visual FoxPro form. However, Visual FoxPro provides ways to control the
current object. This article describes the properties of a form that you
can use to set the tab order of objects on a form, refer to the active
control on a form, and set the focus to a control.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The _CUROBJ system memory variable returns a value when a READ is active,
and it is not used in the Visual FoxPro event model. However, the form
object exposes methods and properties that provide information about the
current control.
<P>
<P><h3>Retrieving or Setting the Access Order of an Object</h3>
 
<P>
By default, controls are accessed in the order they are created on a form.
You can alter this default with the TABINDEX property. The TABINDEX
property specifies the tab order of controls on a form or specifies the
order of forms in a form set. It returns a numeric value. You can read or
write it at both design and run time.
<P>
For example, to ensure that a command button called CMDBUTTON3 in a form
called TEST is the third control accessed on a form, you can type:
<P>
<PRE>   TEST.CmdButton3.Tabindex= 3

</PRE>NOTE: setting the TABINDEX property will not move the focus to a control.
<P>
<P><h3>Referencing the Active Control on a Form</h3>
 
<P>
The ACTIVECONTROL property references the active control on a form. It
returns a reference to the object that currently has the focus on a form.
You can use the ACTIVECONTROL property to refer to and manipulate a control
on a form or form page generically.
<P>
For example, to change the font of the active control to bold, you can type
the following in the Refresh method of the form:
<P>
<PRE>   IF TYPE('THISFORM.ActiveControl')="O"
      THISFORM.ActiveControl.FontBold= .F.
   ELSE
      =MESSAGEBOX('There is no Control active on this form')
   ENDIF

</PRE>The ACTIVECONTROL property is read-only at run time. It cannot be used to
set the focus to a specific control.
<P>
<P><h3>Setting the Focus on a Control in a Form</h3>
 
<P>
Use the SETFOCUS method to move the focus to a specific control in a form.
The SETFOCUS method is a method of a control. It requires that you
reference the object to which you want to move. You can use the SETFOCUS
along with the CONTROLS collection of a form to access controls on a form
generically.
<P>
For example, if you want to move the focus to the previous control on the
form, you can type the following in the Click event handler of the control:
<P>
<PRE>   ncontrol=This.Tabindex
   THISFORM.CONTROLS(ncontrol-1).SETFOCUS

</PRE>This assumes that the CONTROLS array is in the same order as the TABINDEX
and that the form does not contain a page frame. A page frame is a
container for controls, so it uses its own controls array.
