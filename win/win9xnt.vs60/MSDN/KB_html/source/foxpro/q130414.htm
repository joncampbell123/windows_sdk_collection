The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Changing the ColumnCount property of a grid class, subclassed onto a form,
to a value less than the one already set for the grid class when it was
created results in this error:
<P>
<PRE>   Member COLUMN&lt;n&gt; is a class member.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
You cannot delete members from an instantiated object that are members of
the base class.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you insert a Grid class into a form, you cannot change the ColumnCount
property to a value less than the one that was set when the Grid class was
created. If you do so, the "Member COLUMN&lt;n&gt; is a class member" error
message is displayed. In this error, &lt;n&gt; is a number that is one greater
than the ColumnCount value you are trying to set for the Grid class in the
form.
<P>
For example if ColumnCount for the Grid class was set to 3 when it was
created, and you change it to 2, 1, or 0 when placed in a form, then the
value of &lt;n&gt; in the error message will be 3, 2, or 1 respectively.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create a Grid class  with three columns.

<P><LI>Create a form.

<P><LI>Drop an instance of the Grid class onto the form, and populate the
   three-column grid.

<P><LI>Save and run the form. Everything works as expected.

<P><LI>Modify the form.

<P><LI>Change ColumnCount for the grid to 2. The error "Member COLUMN3 is a
   class member" is displayed.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: If the ColumnCount is changed to 1, the error message is "Member
COLUMN2 is a class member."
