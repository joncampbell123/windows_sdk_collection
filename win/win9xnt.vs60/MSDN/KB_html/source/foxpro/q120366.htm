<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Disk Tools floppy disk, included with the Macintosh System 7.1 package,
is a bootable disk.
<P>
You can boot from it directly, or use it to make a new bootable floppy disk
by copying its System Folder to the new floppy disk.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In the process of troubleshooting problems on the Macintosh, you may need
to make changes to the System Folder. As a precautionary measure, you
should have a bootable floppy disk ready beforehand.
<P>
NOTE: If you have any INITs or CDEVs necessary to run your Macintosh, be
sure to copy them to the System Folder on the newly created bootable floppy
disk. You should not make any changes to the Disk Tools floppy disk.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Copy the Disk Tools' System Folder to Another Floppy Disk</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Insert a blank floppy disk in the disk drive. A floppy disk icon
   will appear on the desktop, labeled Untitled (unless the floppy
   disk has been given a different name).

<P><LI>From the Special menu, choose Eject Disk. Note that the Untitled
   floppy disk remains on the desktop and becomes gray.

<P><LI>Slide the write-protect tab open on the Disk Tools disk, then
   insert it into the floppy disk drive. When the Disk Tools icon
   appears on the desktop, double-click it to open its window.

<P><LI>Drag the System Folder from the Disk Tools window to the Untitled
   disk icon.

<P><LI>You may be prompted multiple times to insert the Untitled or Disk
   Tools disks as the files are copied. Insert the appropriate disk as
   instructed until the System Folder has been copied.

<P><LI>Drag the Disk Tools icon to the Trash icon to remove it from the
   desktop.

<P><LI>Drag the Untitled icon to the Trash icon to eject it from the disk
   drive.
<P>
</OL>The Untitled floppy disk is now bootable. To boot from it, turn off
the Macintosh, insert the disk in the drive, then turn the Macintosh on.
