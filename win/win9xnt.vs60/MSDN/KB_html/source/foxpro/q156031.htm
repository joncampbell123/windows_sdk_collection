The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you are using Visual FoxPro 5.0 or Visual FoxPro 5.0 applications on
Windows NT version 3.51, you might see the following message:
<P>
<PRE>   VFP.EXE - Ordinal Not Found
   The ordinal 419 could not be located in the dynamic-link library file,
   Oleaut32.dll.

</PRE>This message can occur if you are doing one of the following:

<UL><LI>Attempting to run Visual FoxPro before restarting the computer as
   directed after installing the full version of Visual FoxPro.

<LI>Attempting to run a Visual FoxPro application created with the Setup
   Wizard before restarting the computer as directed after installing the
   application.

<LI>Attempting to run Visual FoxPro or a Visual FoxPro application after
   installing a Windows NT 3.51 Service Pack.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The message appears if you are using an outdated version of the
Oleaut32.dll file.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
In the situations described by the first two items above, restarting the
computer corrects the problem. The proper version of the Oleaut32.dll file
is present, but is not loaded until NT 3.51 has been restarted.
<P>
In the situation described in the third item above, the NT 3.51 Service
Pack installation program has overwritten the Oleaut32.dll file with an
earlier version. To remedy this problem, you must uninstall and then
reinstall Visual FoxPro or the Visual FoxPro application in order to
restore the proper version of the Oleaut32.dll file.
<P>
Alternately, you can update the version of the Oleaut32.dll file in the
Service Pack to the version included with Visual FoxPro and then reinstall
the Service Pack, as described below.
<P>
<P><h3>Updating the Service Pack Version of the Oleaut32.dll File</h3>
 
<P>
The following procedure was tested with Windows NT 3.51 and Service Pack 4,
and it allows Visual FoxPro to start without error. This information is
supplied as a possible alternative to reinstallation of Visual FoxPro or
the distributed application.
<P>
CAUTION: This procedure is not supported. Use it at your own risk and only
after backing up all relevant files.

<OL><P><LI>In the Windows NT Service Pack directory (the directory that contains
   the Update.exe file), rename the Oleaut32.dll file to Oleaut32.old.

<P><LI>From the Os\system folder on the Visual FoxPro CD, copy the Oleaut32.dll
   file to the Service Pack folder.

<P><LI>Reinstall the Service Pack by running the Update.exe file.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Install Visual FoxPro or a Visual FoxPro application on a computer
   running Windows NT 3.51.

<P><LI>Attempt to start Visual FoxPro or the application. The message
   described in the SYMPTOMS section above occurs.
<P>
</OL>-or-

<OL><P><LI>Install a Windows NT 3.51 Service Pack on a computer with Visual FoxPro
   or a Visual FoxPro application installed.

<P><LI>Attempt to start Visual FoxPro or the application. The message described
   in the SYMPTOMS section occurs.
