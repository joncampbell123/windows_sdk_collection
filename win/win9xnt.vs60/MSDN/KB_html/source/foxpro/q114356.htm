<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
With the introduction of FoxPro version 2.5b for Macintosh, a number of
wizards have been added to FoxPro. Wizards are programs that allow generic
tasks to be completed quickly. The available wizards vary by platform.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following chart details the wizards available on each platform. An
asterisk (*) following the wizard name indicates that the wizard requires
that the FoxPro Connectivity Kit be installed in order be available.

</PRE><h3>Descriptions of the Wizards</h3>
 
<P>
Screen Wizard:
<P>
The Screen Wizard creates a FoxPro screen you can use to view and modify
the information in your tables. The screen includes a series of buttons for
displaying, editing, and printing records. You can choose from three
different styles of screens, and have your choice of buttons with text
labels, such as "Next" or "Top," or buttons with pictures that represent
each button's function.
<P>
Report Wizard:
<P>
The Report Wizard creates a report from a table, using a style, layout, and
sort order that you select.
<P>
Group/Total Wizard:
<P>
The Group/Total Report Wizard creates a report that sorts records into up
to three groupings, and optionally provides subtotals and totals for
numeric fields.
<P>
Multi-Column Report Wizard:
<P>
The Multi-Column Report Wizard uses a table you specify to set up a report
with one, two, or three columns of data per page. You can choose the report
style and layout.
<P>
Label Wizard:
<P>
The Label Wizard sets up information in your tables to be printed out in
label form. You can choose a variety of Avery label types in English or
Metric label sizes.
<P>
Table Wizard:
<P>
The Table Wizard helps you set up a new Microsoft FoxPro table. Just choose
the fields you want for your table from the sample tables provided. These
samples are already set up with typical data types and field lengths: You
can use them as they are, or rename them and change the data types and
field lengths as needed.
<P>
Mail Merge Wizard:
<P>
Using a Microsoft FoxPro table, the Mail Merge Wizard creates a data source
that your word processor can use in a mail merge. After completing the
wizard, follow your word processor's steps for merging this data source
with a main document such as a form letter, label, envelope, or catalog.
<P>
SQL Query Wizard:
<P>
The SQL Query Wizard searches one or more tables for records that match the
criteria you specify. It creates a query file with a .QPR extension, the
same type of query created when you use FoxPro's RQBE. FoxPro .QPR queries
allow you to use aggregate functions (such as AVG, COUNT, MAX, MIN, or SUM)
in your query. The query results are read-only; you can browse them or
incorporate them into a report, but cannot update the records.
<P>
Updatable Query Wizard:
<P>
The Updatable Query Wizard searches one or more tables for records that
match the criteria you specify. It creates an updatable query file with an
.FPQ extension. When you run your query, you create a set of data which you
can edit; changes you make to the records in the query results will be
reflected in the tables the query is based upon.
<P>
Client-Server Query Wizard:
<P>
The Client-Server Query Wizard lets you connect to any ODBC data server and
use a SQL query to retrieve data from it. It creates a query file with a
.CSQ extension. Each time you run the query file, it will initiate a
connection with the server and run the query. FoxPro .CSQ queries allow you
to use aggregate functions (such as AVG, COUNT, MAX, MIN, or SUM) in your
query where the ODBC source allows that capability. The resulting query is
read-only; you can browse it or incorporate it into a report, but you
cannot update the records. (ODBC is only used on the Windows platform. On
the MS-DOS platform, FPSQL.PLB--provided with the FoxPro Connectivity Kit--
is used to connect directly to Microsoft SQL Server or Sybase.)
<P>
NOTE: The Client-Server Query Wizard is available only if you are using the
Professional edition of Microsoft FoxPro version 2.6. Some back-end
database servers do not support all the functionality available through the
wizard, such as outer joins. Be sure to check to see if your ODBC driver
supports the functions you request from the wizard.
