The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0
<LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5, 2.5a, and 2.5b
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you are creating an executable file in FoxPro for Windows, you notice
that the distributed application's appearance is quite different from what
it was during development.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This difference occurs because the default font in the Windows environment
is usually different than the font that FoxPro uses to dimension the main
desktop.
<P>
The default font you have specified in the Screen Layout dialog box in the
Screen Builder must match your current screen font.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To avoid this problem during development, issue MODIFY WINDOW SCREEN FONT
"foxfont" as the first line of executable code in the executable's main
program. Although this is enough to correct the problem on the development
machine, it still is not enough to solve the problem on the systems the
executable will eventually be run on.
<P>
To completely resolve this issue, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Make MODIFY WINDOW SCREEN FONT &lt;font name&gt; the first line of executable
   code in the main program of the application.
<P>
   NOTE: &lt;Font name&gt; should be the name of the default font in FoxPro. To
   determine the default font, hold down the SHIFT key and choose Screen
   Font from the Text menu in FoxPro. By default, the font will be FoxFont,
   but this setting can be changed by the user. Any font can be used as the
   default font, but it is recommended that you use FoxFont because it can
   be distributed freely, unlike other TrueType fonts. If you use another
   font, all machines that run the application will have to have that font
   installed.

<P><LI>Install FOXFONT.FON using the Fonts icon in the Windows Control Panel.
<P>
   NOTE: This step must be performed on any machine that will run the
   executable application.

<P><LI>Include FOXFONT.FON in the set of files to be distributed with the
   executable file.
<P></OL>
