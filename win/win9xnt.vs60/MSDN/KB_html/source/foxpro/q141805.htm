The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0b
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When attempting to run your form, you get the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Error loading file - ControlSource - record number 4. Unknown
   member &lt;member_name&gt;.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
You have an object on the form that has a ControlSource property that
references an object that used to be on the form but was subsequently been
deleted and replaced with a object of the same name as the deleted object.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 

<OL><P><LI>Select the object that has the incorrect reference, and delete it from
   the form.

<P><LI>Save the form.

<P><LI>Paste the object back onto the form.
<P>
</OL>These steps will change the object hierarchy reference, and your form
should run as expected.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem has been fixed in
Visual FoxPro 5.0 for Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Form objects are added to the end of an .scx file. Because of this,
property references are positionally dependent. In the following
example, the text box object (object B) placed on the form references
the Name property of the check box object (object A). When the form is
run, the example works correctly.
<P>
Removing the text box object from the form and replacing it with an
identical object that is still referenced by the text box object moves
the position of the check box object from the beginning of the .scx file
to a position after the text box.
<P>
Because of the way objects and property references are processed, when
the form is run, you will get the noted error message. The new check box
object that is placed on the form is written to the end of the file and is
not available when required by the reference in the text box object.
<P>
Steps to Reproduce Problem
 

<OL><P><LI>In the Command window, type this command:
<P>
   CREATE FORM testform

<P><LI>Place a check box on the form, and then place a text box on the form.

<P><LI>For the text box, set the ControlSource property to:
<P>
   Thisform.Check1.Name

<P><LI>Save and run the form. You will see the name of the check box object
   on the form ("Check box1").

<P><LI>Modify the form, and select and delete the check box object.

<P><LI>Place a new check box on the form, and run the form a second time. You
   will get the error message.
<P></OL>
