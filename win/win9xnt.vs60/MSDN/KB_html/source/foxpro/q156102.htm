The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Cross-Tab Wizard, which is invoked from the first dialog box of the
Query Wizard, is a class provided by Visual FoxPro. It guides you through
building a query and displaying the results of that query in spreadsheet
format. The class requires that you specify fields from a table as the
elements of the resulting spreadsheet. The Cross-Tab Wizard requires field
designations for "row," "column," and "data."
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The requirement for the three field designations comes before the dialog
box that permits specifying counts, sums, averages, minimums, or maximums.
Before you can select any of these arithmetic functions, you must complete
the sources for the "row," "column," and "data" designations. If the result
set shows only one or two fields plus the results of an arithmetic
function, the three-field designation requirement appears to be an
inflexible characteristic of the Cross-Tab Wizard class.
<P>
Visual FoxPro 5.0 for Windows lets you use one value as both the "data"
field and either the "row" or the "column" designations.
<P>
Completing the construction of the query using the Cross-Tab Wizard, then
modifying the resulting query in the Query Designer may satisfy the Wizard
while still giving you a useful display in spreadsheet format. The last
dialog page of the Cross-Tab Wizard provides this step as one of the final
choices.
<P>
An alternative, which is not supported by Microsoft Technical Support, is
to subclass the Cross-Tab Wizard file, Vfpxtab.vcx, so that the derived
class provides the necessary three values when only one value and an
arithmetic function's result are required for the spreadsheet.
<P>
The following example describes a way to count the number of orders that
exceed a certain value and have been booked at a discount. The desired
result is a simple count by discount level:

<OL><P><LI>In Visual FoxPro for Windows, click New on the File menu, then select
   Query and click the Wizard button.

<P><LI>Select the Cross-Tab Wizard from the three options, and click OK.

<P><LI>Browse for the table Samples\Data\Orders.dbf.

<P><LI>Choose the fields Orders_net and Orders_dsc (discount), then click Next.

<P><LI>Drag the Orders_dsc field to the Row text box. Drag the Orders_net
   field to the Column text box. Drag the Orders_net field to the Data
   edit box. Click Next.

<P><LI>In the third step there are two columns of option buttons. The left
   column is for Summary. Click the Count option. The right column is
   for Subtotals. Click "Number of cells containing data." Click Next.

<P><LI>In the last dialog box, click "Save cross-tab query and modify in Query
   Designer." Clear the "Display null values" check box. Click Finish,  and
   give the query a name. ("Orders.qpr" is the default.)

<P><LI>The Cross-Tab Wizard closes, and the Query Designer appears. In the
   lower half of the Query Designer, click the Filter tab.

<P><LI>In the Field drop-down list, click Orders.order_net. In the Criteria
   box, click "&gt;" (right angle bracket), and in the Example box, type 3000.
   Once you have entered this selection criteria, run the query.
<P>
</OL>The result set is displayed with one row spread across multiple columns--
one cell for each order (since each order is for a unique value in the
example table). The last column shows the intended result: the count of
orders booked at a discount.
