<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The following questions and answers pertain to configuration, environment,
and network use issues.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Configuration and Environment</h3>
 

<PRE>1. Q. I am receiving the error message "Too many files open." How
      can I correct this problem?

   A. If you receive this error message, use one or more of the
      following strategies:

      1. Increase the FILES setting in the CONFIG.SYS file.

      2. If you are using a Novell network, increase the FILE
         HANDLES setting in the SHELL.CFG file.

      3. If you are using the MS-DOS Share program, increase the
         number of files and locks. (For example, you could use
         SHARE /F:5120 /L:500.)

2. Q. The Standard Version of Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS runs
      correctly, but when I load the Extended Version, I receive the
      error message "Incompatible memory manager." What is causing
      this problem?

   A. When you configure your memory manager, verify that you allow it
      to create expanded memory. Please refer to the "Optimizing Your
      System" section in the "Developer's Guide" for further
      information on the Extended Version of FoxPro.

3. Q. I am receiving the error message "Run command failed." How
      can I correct this problem?

   A. This error is caused by one of the following conditions:

      a. Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS cannot find the COMMAND.COM
         file. If this is the case, use the SHELL= statement with the
         /P parameter in your CONFIG.SYS file to specify the location
         of the COMMAND.COM file.

         - or -

      b. If the location of COMMAND.COM is already specified,
         FoxPro does not have enough conventional memory to execute
         the command. If this is the case, use FoxSwap to execute the
         command. (For example, use RUN/0 DIR instead of RUN DIR.)
         RUN/0 automatically makes all available conventional memory
         accessible.

4. Q. Why do I have several files with the extension .TMP on my
      disk?

   A. Every time you load Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS, it creates
      temporary (.TMP) files. These files are automatically deleted
      when you exit FoxPro with a normal shutdown. The .TMP files
      still exist if you reboot the machine from within FoxPro, or if
      you don't have delete rights in the directory where the files
      reside. Exit FoxPro and acquire the rights to delete all these
      files.

</PRE><h3>Running on a Network</h3>
 

<PRE>1. Q. When a second user enters Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS on my
      network, the error message "File in use by another" is
      displayed. How can I correct this problem?

   A. If you are on a peer-to-peer network, you must first load the
      MS-DOS Share program and then verify that the FoxPro files are
      marked as read only. The FOXUSER database can be shared only if
      the file is marked "RO" (read only). If you receive this error
      message when you try to open a database file, make sure that
      both users have EXCLUSIVE set to OFF.
