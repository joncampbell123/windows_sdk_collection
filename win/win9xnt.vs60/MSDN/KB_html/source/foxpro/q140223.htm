The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you convert a screen from a earlier version of FoxPro to Visual FoxPro
and that screen has a spinner on it, the screen will finish converting and
then display "Syntax error" if the SET POINT command is set to a comma in
Visual FoxPro.
<P>
When the error is displayed, you might think that the screen did not finish
converting. However, the screen has indeed finished converting; it just
cannot be run, even if you set the SET POINT command back to the default of
a period.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When the SET POINT TO command is set to a comma, it places a comma in the
Increment and Value properties line in the Properties field of the .scx
file. Visual FoxPro requires a period in that field and changes it to a
comma in the spinner when the form is run.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Set the SET POINT TO command to a period before converting the form, and
then set it back to a comma after the conversion takes place.
<P>
To correct a converted form that has the problem, you must open the form as
a table and modify the properties memo field of the spinner. The Increment
and Value properties will have a comma in the numeric number that is
assigned to them. Replace the comma with a period and the form can be
modified or run.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create a screen called Spinner in an earlier version of FoxPro.

<P><LI>Add a spinner to the screen, and then close it.

<P><LI>Open Visual FoxPro and type the following command in the Command window:
<P>
   SET POINT TO ","

<P><LI>Modify the screen created in the earlier version of FoxPro while in
   Visual FoxPro. When asked what format to convert the screen, choose
   Functional. The problem is the same if converting in Functional or
   Visual format. As the screen is finishing the conversion, the error
   "Syntax Error" appears. Trying to run or modify the converted form
   gives the same error.

<P><LI>In the Command window, type:
<P>
   USE spinner.scx

<P><LI>Browse the table, and look in each Class memo field record to locate the
   record that has the word "spinner" in it. After finding that record,
   open the Properties memo field of that record, and locate the properties
   Increment and Value. Note that the number beside these properties may
   have a comma in it. Replace the comma with a period, and close the memo
   field. After closing the table, you should be able to run or modify the
   converted form. The SET POINT TO "," command can then be used to show
   the spinner using commas.
