The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 5.0, 5.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When printing a report from the Report Writer Designer, the report is sent
to the printer as expected. All of the objects in the report, however, are
selected in the Report Writer Designer.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Any actions to refresh the Report Writer Designer such as minimizing the
report, minimizing Visual FoxPro, or bringing up another window in another
application restore the report objects' correct, visual state.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed
at the beginning of this article. We are researching this bug and will post
new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The visual state of the objects "selected" status is now reversed; those
objects that appear to be "selected" are not. If you "deselect" an object,
you are actually "selecting" it in a functional way, although you are not
getting the correct visual cue.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create a quick report using the Employee table in the \Vfp\Samples\Data
   folder.

<P><LI>Click Print on the Report Writer Designer toolbar.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: The report is sent to the printer. All of the objects in the Report
Writer Designer, however, will be "selected."
