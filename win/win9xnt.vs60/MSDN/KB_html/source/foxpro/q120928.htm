<P>
 
<P><h2>Part 1: FoxPro Version 2.6 for UNIX Notes</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Documentation</h3>
 
FoxPro version 2.6 for UNIX documentation includes a UNIX-specific
Installation and Configuration manual along with the books for FoxPro for
MS-DOS. The Help file includes topics describing the new functionality
included in FoxPro for UNIX.
<P>
<P><h3>Correction</h3>
 
The Installation and Configuration manual incorrectly lists the return
value of SYS(2010) as the null string. FoxPro for UNIX returns 255,
which is the same value that FoxPro for Windows returns.
<P>
<P><h3>New Key Sequence</h3>
 
FoxPro includes a refresh key sequence to clear terminals when the
screen becomes garbled (system wide messages, noise on the serial line).
This key sequence is CTRL+].
<P>
<P><h3>terminfo Entries</h3>
 
See the file terminfo.src in your FoxPro installation directory
(usually /usr/lib/foxpro) for information about what terminals are
supported and how to write a new entry if you are having problems with
your terminal.
 
<P>
 
Part 2: Installation Notes
 
<P>
FoxPro is normally installed in the directory /usr/lib/foxpro by the
installation utility custom. Instructions on how to install using
custom can be found in the Installation and Configuration manual. If
you do not want to install FoxPro in the default directory or if you do
not have the custom utility, you can install FoxPro using the shell
script extract located on the first installation disk.
<P>
To use the script extract, follow these steps:
<P>
1  Change your current directory to the directory you wish to install
<PRE>   in (the default is /usr/lib/foxpro). For example, type the
   following at the system prompt and press Enter:

       cd /other/FoxPro

</PRE>2  If your 3.5-inch drive is your A: drive, to copy the extract script
<PRE>   off the installation disk type the following at the system prompt and
   press Enter:

       tar xvf /dev/install ./tmp/extract

   If your 3.5-inch drive is your B: drive, use /dev/install1:

       tar xvf /dev/install1 ./tmp/extract

</PRE>3  Type one of the following to run the extract script:
<P>
<PRE>   For drive A:  ./tmp/extract /dev/install

   -Or-

   For drive B:  ./tmp/extract /dev/install1

</PRE>4  Follow the system prompts.
<P>
Note that some systems may use device names other than /dev/install and
/dev/install1. If you get an extraction error, consult your system
documentation for the name of your floppy device.
<P>
If you have the directory /etc/perms, a permissions file is added to
it. This file contains the new location of the FoxPro files so that the
custom utility will work as expected when removing FoxPro.
 
<P>
 
<P><h2>Part 3: Macro Key Support in FoxPro Version 2.6</h2>
 
<P>
In FoxPro version 2.6, the key combinations ALT+1 to ALT+9 cannot be used
to define macros because these sequences are used by the UNIX operating
system to switch console multiscreens. For a list of key combinations
that are supported see the ON KEY LABEL topic in Help.
 
 
<P><h2>Part 4: Running on Non-SCO Systems</h2>
 
<P>
Some FoxPro for UNIX features are not completely supported on platforms
other than SCO UNIX. These features include direct video memory
writes, the SCO event queue management system, scancode support on
terminals, and compression technology. Below is a description of how
to work around these features. For more information on the command
line switches described see the "Customizing FoxPro" chapter in the
Installation and Configuration manual.
<P>
<P><h3>Direct Video Memory Writes</h3>
 
On some non-SCO systems, accessing the console video memory directly
results in the loss of multiple-screen functionality. To disable direct
video memory writes, include the -o switch on the command line when
starting FoxPro.
<P>
<P><h3>SCO Event Queue Management</h3>
 
Some systems either do not support the SCO event queue system, or do so
incorrectly. If you are having trouble accessing the keyboard, include
the -e switch on the command line when starting FoxPro to disable the
event queue.
<P>
<P><h3>Scan Code Support</h3>
 
Most non-SCO systems do not support scan codes over a serial line and
some have trouble even on the console. To disable scan code support
add the -i switch on the command line when starting FoxPro.
<P>
<P><h3>Compression Utility</h3>
 
Most of the FoxPro installation files are compressed. SCO supports a
version of tar that automatically uncompresses the compressed files.
If you aren't running SCO UNIX 3.2.2, XENIX 2.3.4, or a later version
of these products, you won't have the correct version of tar. When
this happens, the installation scripts attempt to decompress with the
uncompress utility. If both tar and the uncompress utility are not
present, you will not be able to install FoxPro. For more information
about uncompress utilities supported by your system, see your
system documentation.
 
<P>
 
Part 5: scoterm Resources
 
<P>
The resource file that SCO ships for scoterm (/usr/lib/X11/app-
defaults/ScoTerm) may not provide all of the resources necessary to run
FoxPro effectively in a scoterm window. scoterm will not run in scancode
mode unless the *keyboard resource is set to a value (for example, us).
Also, the default colors need to be set up to match the console's colors.
<P>
See the file goodies/scoterm.res for the correct resources.
 
<P>
 
<P><h2>Part 6: New and Enhanced Commands and Functions</h2>
 
<P>
Several commands and functions are new to FoxPro version 2.6, and some have
been enhanced to provide additional compatibility with dBASE(R) IV. For
additional information about these commands and functions, see the
following topics in the Help file: Doc Changes Since Printing, dBASE
Compatibility Issues, International/X-Platform, or the name of the
specific command or function.

</PRE> 
<P>
Question 1
<P>
I receive the error message "File is in use by another" when I try to
open a file. No one else has the file open. How can I solve this?
<P>
Answer 1
<P>
The UNIX kernel grants a limited number of file locks to all
applications. The number of locks available can be selected by running
the configure command in /etc/conf/cf.d.
 
<P>
Question 2
<P>
I receive the error message "NOTICE: File table overflow" or "No file".
How can I correct this?
<P>
Answer 2
<P>
The UNIX kernel grants a limited number of open files to each
application. The number of open files available can be selected by
running the configure command in /etc/conf/cf.d.
 
<P>
Question 3
<P>
The message "Position is off the screen" appears. How can I correct
this problem?
<P>
Answer 3
<P>
Your terminal is trying to access a line that is off the screen.
FoxPro expects there to be at least 25 lines. If possible, your
terminal should be configured to be at least 25 lines.
 
<P>
Question 4
<P>
Certain keystrokes do not work as intended or do not exist on my
keyboard. How can I fix this?
<P>
Answer 4
<P>
Refer to "Special Terminal Considerations for UNIX" in Chapter 2 of the
Installation and Configuration manual or "Keystrokes for Terminals" in
the Help file.
 
<P>
Question 5
<P>
My terminal locks up or freezes when I use a control keystroke
combination.
<P>
Answer 5
<P>
Some terminals have key press sequences that lock the terminal. In
most cases you can choose an alternate key sequence. For more
information about key sequences, refer to "Special Terminal
Considerations for UNIX" in Chapter 2 of the Installation and
Configuration manual or "Keystrokes for Terminals" in the Help file.
 
<P>
Question 6
<P>
One or more characters seem to disappear for no apparent reason. How
can I correct this problem?
<P>
Answer 6
<P>
Your terminal may be experiencing standout glitch. Some terminals need
to use one character position on the screen when changing in and out of
reverse video. You may be able to turn off this attribute byte or
choose another emulation that does not need it. See your system
documentation for more information.
 
<P>
Question 7
<P>
Pressing the left arrow key deletes characters. How can I stop this
from happening?
<P>
Answer 7
<P>
Your terminal may emit the same sequence for the left arrow as it does
for the backspace key. Refer to your system documentation to find out
if your terminal has an emulation that generates different sequences
for the arrow keys. You may also define the "kbs" string in your
terminfo entry to something other than CTRL-H (such as CTRL-B).
<P>
 
<P>
Question 8
<P>
I cannot access a file for which I should have permission. How can I
correct this?
<P>
Answer 8
<P>
To determine the file's permission, type the following at the UNIX
prompt:
<P>
<PRE>       ls -l &lt;filename&gt;

</PRE>If you own the file and it needs to be made writable, type:
<P>
<PRE>       chmod +w &lt;filename&gt;

</PRE>If you do not own the file and need to change permissions, contact the
owner of the file.
 
<P>
Question 9
<P>
I get the message "File too large" or files can not be written beyond a
certain size. How can I correct this?
<P>
Answer 9
<P>
UNIX has a configuration option named ulimit that can be set to limit a
file's size. Each process can set its own ulimit, but it must be less
than or equal to the system's ulimit. The system wide ulimit can be
set by running the configure command in /etc/conf/cf.d.
 
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>Topic 2: Multiuser Issues</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Overview of Questions</h3>
 
1  When a second user loads Microsoft FoxPro for UNIX, the user
<PRE>   receives the error message "File in use by another."  How can I
   correct this problem?
</PRE>2  Where does FoxPro create temporary files?
3  I'd like to refer to a directory with a single drive letter. Is
<PRE>   this possible?
</PRE> 
<P>
Question 1
<P>
When a second user loads Microsoft FoxPro for UNIX, the user receives
the error message "File in use by another." How can I correct this
problem?
<P>
Answer 1
<P>
Several solutions exist. Verify that the user has read permission to
all necessary FoxPro files, including foxuser.dbf, foxuser.fpt, and
config.fpu (where applicable). Also, all users must have execute
permission for foxpro.pr. See your system administrator to change
permissions.
<P>
Check the permissions on the resource file in FoxPro called foxuser.dbf.
This file stores information about windows, color sets, and other FoxPro
objects. The foxuser database can be used by multiple users by removing
write permissions and granting read permissions.
<P>
If you receive the "File in use by another" error message when you try
to open a database file, make sure that all users have the SET EXCLUSIVE
setting OFF.
 
<P>
Question 2
<P>
Where does FoxPro create temporary files?
<P>
Answer 2
<P>
FoxPro creates temporary files in the /tmp directory unless you
specifically designate an different location. For more information, see
Chapter 5, "Optimizing Your UNIX System," in the Installation and
Configuration manual.
 
<P>
Question 3
<P>
I'd like to refer to a directory with a single drive letter. Is this
possible?
<P>
Answer 3
<P>
Yes, you can use the SET VOLUME command to do this. For example, to
associate the /usr/main directory to C, type SET VOLUME C TO /usr/main
at the system prompt, or type VOLUME C = /usr/main in config.fpu.
NOTE: The volume specified in the SET VOLUME command must exist on the
computer system.
 
<P>
<P><h2>Topic 3: Converting from FoxPro for MS-DOS, Windows, or Macintosh</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Overview of questions</h3>
 
1  Are my existing FoxPro version 2.6 for MS-DOS, Windows and Macintosh
<PRE>   screens and reports compatible with FoxPro version 2.6 for UNIX?
</PRE>2  Can I use my existing library files in FoxPro version 2.6 for UNIX?
3  Are my existing programs compiled under FoxPro version 2.6 for MS-DOS
<PRE>   compatible with FoxPro version 2.6 for UNIX?
</PRE>4  Can I distribute my FoxPro version 2.6 for UNIX applications?
 
<P>
Question 1
<P>
Are my existing FoxPro for MS-DOS, Windows and Macintosh 2.6 screens and
reports compatible with FoxPro version 2.6 for UNIX?
<P>
Answer 1
<P>
The structures of the databases created by the power tools from other
platforms are compatible with FoxPro version 2.6 for UNIX. When you first
open screen and report files created on other platforms, FoxPro asks if you
want to transport them to FoxPro version 2.6 for UNIX format. For more
information about specific FoxPro version 2.6 file formats, see the
Update manual.
 
<P>
Question 2
<P>
Can I use my existing library files in FoxPro version 2.6 for UNIX?
<P>
Answer 2
<P>
Library files cannot be used with FoxPro for UNIX. FoxPro for UNIX has
<P><h3>no Library Construction Kit and does not support LOAD or CALL functions.</h3>
 
<P>
Question 3
<P>
Are my existing programs compiled under FoxPro version 2.6 for MS-DOS
compatible with FoxPro version 2.6 for UNIX?
<P>
Answer 3
<P>
Programs compiled under FoxPro version 2.6 for MS-DOS, such as .APP and
.FXP files, are compatible with FoxPro version 2.6 for UNIX. To run
applications or programs from platforms other than MS-DOS, you should
rebuild or recompile them.
 
<P>
Question 4
<P>
Can I distribute my FoxPro version 2.6 for UNIX applications?
<P>
Answer 4
<P>
To distribute your application or executable file, you must purchase
the Microsoft FoxPro Runtime and install it in your FoxPro directory.
Each copy of the application distributed must have its own copy of
the Runtime.
 
<P>
<P><h2>Topic 4: Printing Issues</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Overview of Questions</h3>
 
1  When I try to print boxes, ASCII characters are printed instead of
<PRE>   boxes. How can I correct this problem?
</PRE>2  I'm using the Relational Query By Example (RQBE) window to send data
<PRE>   to a report. The data in the report is incorrect; the report prints
   the same record over and over. How can I correct this problem?
</PRE>3  Why can't I select the Printer Driver check box in the Printer
<PRE>   Setup Dialog box?
</PRE>4  I can't make the printer drivers work in an executable file. How can
<PRE>   I correct this problem?
</PRE>5  How do I start a print job from a page other than page 1?
6  I get the following error "Cannot write to read-only file" when
<PRE>   printing a report. How can I correct this problem?
</PRE>7  I get an extra blank line when printing labels. How can I correct
<PRE>   this problem?
</PRE>8  I have NewPage and ResetPage enabled in my data grouping but my page
<PRE>   numbering is not reset to 1. How can I correct this problem?
</PRE> 
<P>
Question 1
<P>
When I try to print boxes, ASCII characters are printed instead of
boxes. How can I correct this problem?
<P>
Answer 1
<P>
If you are using an HP LaserJet printer, the default character set does
not include line drawing characters. You can change the default
character set by using the controls on the front panel of the printer.
You will want to set your default to the PC-8 character set.
<P>
If you are not using an HP LaserJet printer and are using printer
drivers, in the Printer Setup dialog, specify a printer setup
appropriate for your printer. If you are already using a printer
driver, modify the P_CODES database in order to send the proper code
for your printer, and rebuild the genpd.app file. If you aren't using a
printer driver, send the proper escape codes to the printer before you
print using the ??? command.
 
<P>
Question 2
<P>
I'm using the Relational Query By Example (RQBE) window to send data to
a report. The data in the report is incorrect; the report prints the
same record over and over. How can I correct this problem?
<P>
Answer 2
<P>
When you created the report, you used alias names in your field
definitions. To correct the report, simply remove the alias names. For
example, a field containing CUSTOMER.NAME should be modified to contain
only NAME.
 
<P>
Question 3
<P>
Why can't I select the printer driver check box in the Printer Setup
dialog box?
<P>
Answer 3
<P>
This problem occurs if you are missing the genpd.app file, if the
_GENPD memory variable is set incorrectly, if the resource file is
turned off, or if the foxuser file is missing, damaged, or marked as
read-only.
 
<P>
Question 4
<P>
I can't make the printer drivers work in an executable file. How can I
correct this problem?
<P>
Answer 4
<P>
Open the project to make sure that the genpd.app file is included in
the project as an application. If it isn't included, add genpd.app to
the project as an application.
<P>
To add genpd.app as an application, choose the Add push button. In the
dialog that appears, choose Application from the Type popup, select
genpd.app and then choose the Add push button.
<P>
NOTE: genpd.app is automatically marked as an excluded project
element.
<P>
Rebuild the project and your executable file. Make sure that you
distribute the genpd.app, foxuser.dbf, and foxuser.fpt with your
executable file.
 
<P>
Question 5
<P>
How do I start a print job from a page other than page 1?
<P>
Answer 5
<P>
To start a print job at a location other than page 1, set _PBPAGE to the
number of the page at which printing should start and create a program
that uses the PRINTJOB...ENDPRINTJOB commands.
<P>
Using the _PBPAGE variable to specify the page number where a print job
starts does not work outside of PRINTJOB...ENDPRINTJOB.
<P>
For example, suppose your printer jammed on page 75 of a 100-page report
and all output from page 75 through 100 was lost. The code to re-create
the last 25 pages is as follows:
<P>
<PRE>       _PBPAGE=75
       PRINTJOB
       REPORT FORM test.FRX ENVIRONMENT PDSETUP TO PRINT
       ENDPRINTJOB

</PRE>Or, if you just wanted to only print page 75, then set "_PBPAGE=75" and
"_PEPAGE=75" in the previous example.
 
<P>
Question 6
<P>
I get the following error "Cannot write to read-only file" when printing
a report. How can I correct this problem?
<P>
Answer 6
<P>
Given the following circumstances, the error message "Cannot write to a
read-only file" will occur when you try to print a report from within
an application (.app) or an executable (.exe) program:
<P>
<PRE>   - The resource file is included in the project.

   - The resource is set to the included filename.

   - The REPORT FORM &lt;name&gt; PDSETUP TO PRINT or LABEL FORM &lt;name&gt;
     PDSETUP TO PRINT command is issued.

</PRE>There are two ways to avoid this problem:
<P>
<PRE>   - Remove PDSETUP from the command.

     -Or-

   - Mark the resource file as excluded and ship it along with the .app
     or .exe file.
</PRE> 
<P>
Question 7
<P>
I get an extra blank line when printing labels. How can I correct
this problem?
<P>
Answer 7
<P>
This behavior existed in dBASE III and FoxBASE. It was changed in
FoxPro version 1.02. However, to maintain compatibility with the large
installed base of Xbase applications, a design decision was made to
revert to the original behavior.
<P>
To work around this problem, print the label form to a file, open the
file with low-level file functions, remove the carriage return/linefeed
(CR/LF) characters and send the file to the printer using the UNIX cp
command. For example:
<P>
<PRE>   *--Set the number of lines printed per page and print to a file.
   _PLENGTH=56
   LABEL FORM &lt;form name&gt; ENVIRONMENT PDSETUP TO FILE temp.txt

   *--Open file and replace the CR/LF pair with null characters.
   filehand=FOPEN('temp.txt',2)
   =FGETS(filehand)
   =FSEEK(filehand,-2,1)
   =FWRITE(filehand,chr(0)+chr(0))
   =FCLOSE(filehand)

   *--Copy the file to printer and prevent the appearance of the screen.
   HIDE WINDOW SAVE ALL
   RUN lp -s -dhplaser temp.txt
   SHOW WINDOW ALL

Question 8
<P>
I have NewPage and ResetPage enabled in my data grouping but my page
numbering is not reset to 1. How can I correct this problem?
<P>
Answer 8
<P>
The report has a Bottom Margin setting greater than 0 (zero).
<P>
Set Bottom Margin to 0 and add the necessary lines to the Page Footer
band. For example, if Bottom Margin is set to 2, reset it to 0 and add
two lines to the Page Footer band.

<P>
Question 1
<P>
Every time I try to generate a specific screen, I have to add my
supporting screens to the screen set. How can I avoid this problem?
<P>
Answer 1
<P>
To save these options, you must create a project and include the
screens as a screen set.
 
<P>
Question 2
<P>
When I create a screen set with more than one window, how do I move the
cursor from one window to the next?
<P>
Answer 2
<P>
If all the windows in your screen set are controlled with one READ
command, use the Page Up key, the Page Down key, or modify the value of
the _CUROBJ system memory variable to cycle through the windows of your
screen set. If any one of the windows in your screen set is not
controlled by the READ command, such as a Browse window, then you must
press CTRL+F1 to cycle through the screen set.
 
<P>
Question 3
<P>
How do I coordinate Browse windows with screens?
<P>
Answer 3
<P>
Page D2-96 of the FoxPro Developers Guide give samples for coordinating
Browse windows with screens but omits the SAVE clause in the example.
If the optional BROWSE parameter SAVE is omitted, the Browse window
will close as soon as any other object is clicked.
<P>
The code example should be changed to read as follows:
<P>
<PRE>       IF NOT WVISIBLE("Client List")
          BROWSE NORMAL NOWAIT NODELETE LAST TITLE "Client List" ;
             NOAPPEND NOMENU SAVE FIELDS company ;
             WHEN showgets()
       ENDIF

       IF NOT WVISIBLE("Account Details")
          SELECT details
             BROWSE NORMAL NOWAIT NODELETE LAST TITLE "Client List" ;
                NOAPPEND NOMENU SAVE  ;
                FIELDS ;
                Trans_type:10, ;
                Trans_date:10, ;
                Amt:7,Service
          SELECT clients
       ENDIF
</PRE> 
<P>
Question 4
<P>
How do I page through a format file that contains a READ?
<P>
Answer 4
<P>
Pressing the PAGE UP and PAGE DOWN keys skips one record at a time,
forward or backward, in the database and also refreshes the GETs on
the screen.
<P>
Objects can be placed on different pages or different screens by
placing a READ command in the format file. The READ command should be
placed after the last GET that would appear on each screen. The
following format file example places two objects on the first screen
and two more on the second screen. To display the objects that are on
the next screen, press the Page Up or Page Down key.
<P>
<PRE>       @5,1 GET &lt;var1&gt;
       @6,1 GET &lt;var2&gt;
       READ
       @5,1 GET &lt;var3&gt;
       @6,1 GET &lt;var4&gt;
</PRE> 
<P>
Question 5
<P>
The Cycle option does not work for desktop screens. How can I
correct this?
<P>
<P>
Answer 5
<P>
The Cycle option on the Window menu is designed to switch between
windows defined on the desktop. When a screen set contains several
windows and a desktop screen, Cycle stops on the desktop screen. This
is normal behavior, since the Cycle command is intended to be used with
window screens, not the desktop.
<P>
To work around this behavior, define a window with no borders instead
of using a desktop screen. This will produce a window that looks like
the desktop.
<P>
The Cycle option is used for cycling through window screens in a screen
set or windows defined on the desktop. The shortcut key CTRL+F1 can
also be used to cycle through windows on the desktop.
 
<P>
Question 6
<P>
When I create a screen in FoxPro version 2.6 for UNIX, or transport a
screen from FoxPro version 2.6 for UNIX, I don't see any UNIX objects. Why?
<P>
Answer 6
<P>
FoxPro version 2.6 for UNIX objects are very similar to FoxPro version 2.6
for MS-DOS objects. Therefore, an additional object type is not necessary
and your UNIX objects will show up as MS-DOS objects.
 
<P>
<P><h2>Topic 6: Importing Data</h2>
 
<P>
Question 1
<P>
How do I import a data file into Microsoft FoxPro for UNIX?
<P>
Answer 1
<P>
To import a data file, use either the IMPORT command or the APPEND FROM
command. If you're receiving the error message "String too long to fit,"
make sure that no "field" in the source data file exceeds the field
capacity for a FoxPro table. See the System Capacities topic in Help
for additional information. A wide range of file formats is supported.
See the IMPORT command topic in the Language Reference manual for a
complete list of the supported file formats.

Topic 7: BROWSE Command
 
<P>
<P><h3>Overview of Questions</h3>
 
1  I modified the structure of my database, but when I use the BROWSE
<PRE>   command to view the file, I don't see the changes. How can I correct
   this problem?

<P>
Question 1
<P>
I modified the structure of my database, but when I use the BROWSE
command to view the file, I don't see the changes. How can I correct
this problem?
<P>
Answer 1
<P>
You are most likely using the BROWSE command from the System menu or
the View panel, or you are issuing a BROWSE LAST or BROWSE PREFERENCE
command from the Command window. To see these structural changes, you
must first issue a plain BROWSE command from the Command window to
display the new default representation of the database.
 
<P>
Question 2
<P>
When I press the CTRL+N key combination in my program to append a new
record in the Browse window, I get the musical note instead. How can I
correct this problem?
<P>
Answer 2
<P>
CTRL+N is a shortcut key combination associated with the System menu.
In your program, you must issue the SET SYSMENU ON command and/or use a
BROWSE command instead of the BROWSE NOMENU command.

<P>
<P><h3>Overview of Questions</h3>
 
1  I've created an application that doesn't allow me to edit my
<PRE>   database files. How can I correct this problem?
</PRE>2  My executable file runs correctly under the development version, but
<PRE>   I receive the error message "Feature not available" under the
   stand-alone version. How can I correct this problem?
</PRE> 
<P>
Question 1
<P>
I've created an application that does not allow me to edit my database
files. How can I correct this problem?
<P>
Answer 1
<P>
Including the database in the project automatically makes these files
read only. Mark your database as excluded in the project, then rebuild
your application. You must distribute these files to your end users.
 
<P>
Question 2
<P>
My executable file runs correctly under the development version, but I
receive the error message "Feature not available" under the stand-alone
version. How can I correct this problem?
<P>
Answer 2
<P>
First, check the "Features Not Available" list in the FoxPro for UNIX
Runtime User's Guide. Certain features used for development aren't
available in the applications and executables you create. If you still
encounter problems, it's possible that you're using macro substitution
in your program. The recommended work around is to set up a statement
which causes the compiler to see the possible options for the
macro-substituted commands so that they will be compiled into the .exe
file. For example:
<P>
<PRE>       IF .F.
              MODIFY REPORT dummy
              MODIFY LABEL dummy
       ENDIF

</PRE>This code allows the compiler to see the MODIFY REPORT and MODIFY LABEL
commands, but because it is never executed, the report and label names
can be meaningless (dummy).
