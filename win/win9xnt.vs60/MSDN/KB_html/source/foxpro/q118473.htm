The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro Distribution Kit for Macintosh, versions 2.5x, 2.6a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Installing the Distribution Kit changes files of kind "Microsoft FoxPro
document" to "FoxMac25.esl document."
<P>
NOTE: If an application program (executable) has already been built by the
Distribution Kit, files may instead have the kind "&lt;application_name&gt;
document."
<P>
For example, if an executable called "Test App" has already been built, and
the desktop is then rebuilt, files that should be of the kind "Microsoft
FoxPro document" become "Test App document."
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Macintosh tracks file kinds based on the creator registered in the
desktop file with the latest created date and time. When an application
program is created using the Distribution Kit, a new application program
with the FOXX creator is added to the desktop file with the current date
and time. Therefore, all documents that have the FOXX creator will show up
with the new application's name after the desktop is rebuilt.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Setting the created date for the "Microsoft FoxPro" file (which also has
the creator FOXX) to a date relatively far into the future, such as in the
year 1999, avoids this conflict because it will have a later created date
than all applications built with the Distribution Kit (until that date in
1999).
<P>
CAUTION: This workaround uses Apple's resource editor, ResEdit. Because a
file may be damaged if incorrect changes are made, the use of ResEdit is
recommended for advanced Macintosh users only. As a precautionary step, you
may wish to make a backup copy of the Microsoft FoxPro file before
proceeding.
<P>
NOTE: The instructions below were performed using ResEdit version 2.1.1. If
you use a different version of ResEdit, these instructions may vary
slightly. ResEdit does not come with the Macintosh operating system, but
can be obtained from Macintosh user groups or the Apple Programmers and
Developers Association (ADPA).

<OL><P><LI>Start ResEdit. Press ESC to stop the animated opening screen.

<P><LI>In the opening dialog box, choose Cancel.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Get File/Folder Info.

<P><LI>Select the "Microsoft FoxPro" file, located in the main FoxPro folder.
    Choose Get Info.

<P><LI>Change the date in the Created text box to a later date. For example,
    you may want to change the date to Dec 4, 1999. Because it probably
    doesn't match the new date, be sure to delete the day of the week
    (such as Mon) already in the text box.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Quit.

<P><LI>When prompted by the message "Save 'Info for Microsoft FoxPro' before
    closing?", choose Yes.

<P><LI>While holding down the COMMAND and OPTION keys, choose Restart from
    the  Special menu. Continue holding down the COMMAND and OPTION keys
    while the Macintosh restarts; this rebuilds the desktop.

<P><LI>After the Macintosh restarts, it displays the following dialog box:
<P>
       Are you sure you want to rebuild the
       desktop file on the disk "&lt;disk_name&gt;"?
       Comments in info windows will be lost.

<P><LI>Release the COMMAND and OPTION keys, and then choose OK.
<P>
</OL>Note that the file kind for FoxPro documents has changed back to "Microsoft
FoxPro document."
<P>
<P><h3>Alternative Workaround</h3>
 
<P>
Another workaround is to use the FOXTOOLS.MLB function to reset the creator
type.
<P>
For more information on using the FOXTOOLS.MLB function, please see the
