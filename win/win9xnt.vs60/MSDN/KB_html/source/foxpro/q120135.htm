<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When transporting objects such as screens between platforms such as from
Windows to MS-DOS, the transporter will create additional objects (buttons,
list boxes, and so on) that are platform-specific. The transported object
will have information relevant to both platforms which will result in
larger run-time files unless specific steps are taken to generate code for
the specific platform the object was transported to.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When transporting an object from one platform to another, the transporter
appends additional records to a screen SCX file. These additional records
contain the platform-specific information necessary to run the object on
the new platform. By default, when the transported screen is re-generated
on the new platform, FoxPro creates an SPR with both the new platform and
the old platform code. Consequently, the resulting SPR can be up to twice
as large as it needs to be.
<P>
To remedy this problem, you must select the "xxx Objects only" (where "xxx"
represents MS-DOS, WINDOWS, or MAC) box to generate code for the
appropriate platform.
<P>
For example, in one test, we transported a screen created under FoxPro
version 2.6 for Windows to FoxPro version 2.6 for MS-DOS. The screen was
originally 14K in size. After transporting, the SCX file increased to 24K
in size, due to the additional records added for the MS-DOS platform. When
we regenerated the code without checking the "MS-DOS objects only" box, the
resulting SPR code was 27K in size. But when we regenerated the code after
selecting the "MS-DOS objects only" check box, the SPR code decreased to
16K in size, a net loss of 11K. This was because only code for the MS-DOS
FoxPro environment was generated.
<P>
NOTE: if the screens are not a part of a project, then the "xxx objects
only" box will have to be selected each and every time the screen is
regenerated. Foxpro will use the default generator options. If, however,
the screen is part of a project, it will only be necessary to set this
option once. After that the setting for this option will be respected and
only the platform-specific objects will be generated.
<P>
To permanently decrease the size of the SCX file for a given screen, you
need to run the USE command (for example, USE CUSTOMER.SCX). Then run the
DELETE FOR PLATFORM = &lt;Platform type&gt; cammand and use the PACK comment to
pack the SCX. This is an alternate solution that keeps the SPR code from
growing in size. Valid entries for the &lt;Platform type&gt; are MS-DOS, WINDOWS,
MAC, and UNIX. All other platform values should be left alone.
