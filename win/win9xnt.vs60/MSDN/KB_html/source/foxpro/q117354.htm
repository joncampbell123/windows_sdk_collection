The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b
<LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh Distribution Kit, versions 2.5b, 2.5c
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If your application includes a graphical Help file, you can also distribute
the Microsoft Help engine by adding the "FoxPro Help" and "Microsoft Help"
files to your application folder. These two files are located in the System
Folder:Extensions:Microsoft:Help folder. These files were omitted from the
list of distributable files on page 8 of the "User's Guide" for the FoxPro
for Macintosh Distribution Kit. However, they are listed as distributable
files in the "DK ReadMe" file.
<P>
With Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, you can include graphical help in a
distributed application by selecting this option in the Setup Wizard.
<P>
NOTE: As listed on page 8 of the Distribution Kit "User's Guide," the
FOXHELP.DBF, FOXHELP.FPT, and FOXHELP.HLP files in the FoxPro folder
CANNOT be distributed.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Help files are created using Microsoft Word for Windows or Microsoft Word
for the Macintosh. The rich-text format (RTF) files created by Word must be
compiled with the Windows Help compiler.
<P>
A floppy disk titled "Disk 1 MS-DOS Series" is included with the FoxPro for
Macintosh Distribution Kit. This disk contains the files you need to
compile the RTF files under Windows. It is an MS-DOS-formatted disk, not a
Macintosh-formatted disk. This disk contains the following files:
<P>
<PRE>   HC35.EXE
   HC35.ERR
   SHED.EXE
   SHED.HLP
   MRBC.EXE
