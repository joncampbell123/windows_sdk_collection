</PRE><P><LI> Q. FoxPro 2.0 has 25 work areas. Has this limit been raised in
<P><PRE>       2.5?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. Yes. The MS-DOS-based Extended version and Windows-based
       versions of FoxPro 2.5 have 225 work areas.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. Are more file formats supported for direct import into FoxPro
<P><PRE>       2.5 than in FoxPro 2.0?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. Yes. Support has been added to FoxPro 2.5 for importing
       Microsoft Excel 3.0, Microsoft Excel 4.0, Paradox(R) 3.5, and
       Paradox 4.0 files.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. Are there additional language enhancements to FoxPro 2.5?
<P>
<P><PRE>    A. FoxPro 2.5 contains additional generator directives, new system
       memory variables, and new, enhanced commands and functions. For
       a complete listing of new features in FoxPro 2.5, refer to the
       "Update Guide."
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. I have heard a great deal about cross-platform application
<P><PRE>       development. Is this possible with FoxPro 2.5?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. Yes. FoxPro 2.5 allows you to create and maintain applications
       that run on multiple platforms, such as Windows and MS-DOS, and
       share data with full record locking and other features useful
       for multiuser environments. (An application that can run on
       multiple platforms is a cross-platform application.)
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       You can take several approaches to writing cross-platform
       applications in FoxPro. For example, you can run your MS-DOS-
       based applications directly in Windows with no changes. Another
       approach is to transport your application from one platform to
       another without any additional coding. The transporting
       approach is designed for applications developed with the FoxPro
       Power Tools: Screen Builder, Report Writer, and Label Designer.
       The third approach is to transport your application from one
       environment to another while maintaining separate interfaces
       for your application on each platform.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       For a detailed discussion and examples of these three options,
       refer to the section "Using Files from Other Platforms" in the
       "Update Guide."
