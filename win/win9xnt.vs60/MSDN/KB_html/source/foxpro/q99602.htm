The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS, versions 1.02, 2.0, 2.5, and 2.5a
<LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5 and 2.5a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you are trying to link a stand-alone .EXE file, you receive a
"Link Command Failed" error message.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This error is caused by insufficient conventional memory, which is
probably occurring because other programs and/or drivers are running
simultaneously with FoxPro.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Make More Conventional Memory Available</h3>
 
<P>
To resolve this problem, you need to make more conventional memory
available. The easiest way to do this is by booting "clean" (that is,
booting with a minimal configuration).
<P>
The following batch files make it easy to switch between a clean
environment and your normal environment.
<P>
WARNING: Before you make any modifications to your CONFIG.SYS file,
you should make a bootable system disk (see your MS-DOS documentation)
so that the machine can be booted from a floppy disk if necessary.

<OL><P><LI>At the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following commands:
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy config.sys *.nrm
      copy autoexec.bat *.nrm
</PRE>
<P><LI>Use a text editor to add the following lines to a file named
   CONFIG.CLN:
<P>
<P><PRE>      files=40
      buffers=20
      (Add a disk driver, if needed)
</PRE>
<P><LI>Use a text editor to add the following lines to a file named
   AUTOEXEC.CLN:
<P>
<P><PRE>      path c:\;c:\dos
      prompt $p$g
      (add c:\mouse\mouse if desired)
</PRE>
<P><LI>Use a text editor to add the following lines to a file named
   CLENBOOT.BAT:
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy config.cln *.sys
      copy autoexec.cln *.bat
</PRE>
<P><LI>Use a text editor to add the following lines to a file named
   NORMBOOT.BAT:
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy config.nrm *.sys
      copy autoexec.nrm *.bat
</PRE><P>
</OL>NOTE: If SMARTDrive is running, add the following line to CLENBOOT.BAT
and NORMBOOT.BAT to ensure that the SMARTDrive memory cache is flushed
(written to disk) before the machine is rebooted:
<P>
<PRE>    smartdrv /c

</PRE></OL>Whenever you need a clean boot in order to link a file, type
"CLENBOOT" (without the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS command prompt,
press RETURN, and then reboot the machine. Once the .EXE file has been
linked, type "NORMBOOT" (without the quotation marks), press RETURN,
and reboot the machine again.
<P>
<P><h3>Additional Troubleshooting</h3>
 
<P>
If the steps above do not resolve this problem, try the following:

<OL><P><LI>Verify that FOXSWAP.COM is in the main FoxPro directory. This file
   allows FoxPro to swap memory out to a swap file on disk.

<P><LI>Verify that the configuration file (usually CONFIG.FP or CONFIG.FPW)
   does NOT contain the line DOSMEM=ON. If this line is present, it
   prevents FoxPro from using FOXSWAP.COM.

<P><LI>Verify that the MS-DOS environmental variable TEMP points to a valid
   directory.
<P>
   To test this, type "SET" (without the quotation marks) at an MS-DOS
   prompt, or run the Microsoft Diagnostic utility (MSD.EXE) included with
   Windows. This utility reports an error at start-up if the TEMP variable
   doesn't point to a valid directory.
<P>
   NOTE: Do not run MSD.EXE from Windows - quit Windows first and run it
   directly from MS-DOS.

<P><LI>Verify that the MS-DOS environmental variable COMSPEC points to a valid
   COMMAND.COM file. COMSPEC is sometimes reset by batch files or scripts
   when logging onto a network.
<P>
   Again, use the type "SET" (without the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS
   prompt to view this variable.

<P><LI>Try building the .EXE file directly from the Command window, bypassing
   the Project Manager, by typing the following in the Command window:
<P>
<P><PRE>      BUILD EXE &lt;exe_file&gt; FROM &lt;project_file&gt; EXTENDED
</PRE><P>
   The Project Manager uses up some memory, and sometimes not using it
   frees up enough memory to allow the .EXE file to be built.

<P><LI>Verify that WLINK8.EXE is in the main FoxPro directory.
<P>
   If this WLINK8.EXE isn't present, you will receive a "Bad command or
   file name" error message immediately before receiving the error that the
   link command failed.
<P>
   The easiest way to place WLINK8.EXE in the directory again is to
   reinstall the Distribution Kit.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
