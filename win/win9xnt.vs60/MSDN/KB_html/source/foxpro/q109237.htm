The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5, 2.5a, and 2.5b
<LI>Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS, versions 2.0, 2.5, 2.5a, and 2.5b
<LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, version 2.5b
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you are running a FoxApp-generated application, the following Program
Error message box appears:
<P>
<PRE>   File 'APPERROR.PRG' does not exist.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Given a table and a screen, FoxApp, the Microsoft FoxPro Application
Generator, creates a complete application. The project that FoxApp creates
is fully accessible through the project manager for further customization.
If a mistake is made while the project is being customized, the FoxApp-
generated application may be unable to find its resources.
<P>
In the above case, the application is unable to find the error handler
procedure APPERROR, which is contained in the procedure file APPPROC.PRG.
Only one procedure file can be set at a time, and in this case, a
modification has been made to the application so that the SET PROCEDURE TO
pointer command has been changed without restoring the original.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
When you are modifying a FoxApp-generated application, consider the
suggestions below, which refer to the following hypothetical procedure
file:
<P>
<PRE>   * User-defined procedure file named "USERLIB.PRG"
   PROCEDURE Proc1  &amp;&amp; one of many procedures inside USERLIB
   WAIT WINDOW 'Hello, world'

</PRE><P><LI>Combine the user-generated procedure file into the FoxApp-generated
   procedure file. This file is named APPPROC.PRG. As long as the procedure
   names are unique, it is safe to include the user-defined procedures in
   APPPROC. Since FoxApp generates the same procedure file for every
   application that it creates, you can eliminate redundancy by using a
   common procedure file for all applications.

<P><LI>Maintain the user-generated procedure file and use one of the following
   methods:
<P>
   a. Instead of using SET PROCEDURE TO &lt;user-proc-file&gt;, specify the
<P><PRE>      file in which the procedure exists in the DO call. For example,
</PRE><P>
<PRE>         DO proc1 IN userlib.prg

      calls the procedure Proc1 in the file USERLIB.PRG.

   b. Save and restore the environment before and after every call to a
      procedure within a user-defined procedure file.

         oldProc = SET('PROCEDURE')  &amp;&amp; Save the old procedure
         SET PROCEDURE TO UserLib    &amp;&amp; user-defined procedure file
         DO Proc1      &amp;&amp; call to UDF inside current procedure file
         SET PROCEDURE TO &amp;oldProc   &amp;&amp; restore old procedure file

      Problems will arise if the procedure file contains code that has not
      been fully tested and contains errors. If an error occurs inside a
      procedure, the original problem occurs because the current error
      handler (APPERROR.PRG) cannot be found.

<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Run FoxApp.

<P><LI>Select the CUSTOMER database in the TUTORIAL subdirectory.

<P><LI>Create a new screen named CUSTOMER.

<P><LI>Generate the application.

<P><LI>Open the project associated with the application and add the following
   to the setup code of the CUSTOMER screen within the CUSTOMER screen set:
<P>
<PRE>      SET PROCEDURE TO             &amp;&amp; remove the link to APPPROC
      WAIT WOW 'This is an error'  &amp;&amp; This is an intentional error

</PRE><P><LI>When the screen is run, an error occurs because the application cannot
   find the error routine contained within APPPROC.
