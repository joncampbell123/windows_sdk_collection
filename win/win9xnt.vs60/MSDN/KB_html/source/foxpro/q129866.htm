The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Visual FoxPro for Windows allows long names for tables and fields within a
database. Names of up to 128 characters are allowed.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The long name for the table is not the actual file name as displayed in
file manager but an additional name for the table stored in the database
container. So there are two table names, and you can use either one to open
the table when the database is opened. However, there is only one field
name per field.
<P>
The DISPLAY TABLES command lists the long table names and their actual file
names. Use ADBOBJECT(arrayname,'table') to put the table names into an
array. The array will contain only one name per table. If a table does not
have a long name, the array will contain its filename. Filenames are only
eight characters under Windows and Windows for Workgroups. In operating
systems such as Windows NT, the actual file names can be longer than eight
characters.
<P>
The Visual FoxPro Help File lists the following rules for names:

<OL><P><LI>Names can only contain letters, underscores, and numbers.

<P><LI>Names must begin with a character or an underscore.

<P><LI>Names can have up to 254 characters

<P><LI>Avoid use of reserved words.
<P>
</OL>Long names for fields and tables do not necessarily follow these rules.
Long table names can contain spaces but long field names cannot. The
following creates a table named "Long table name."
<P>
<PRE>   OPEN DATABASE SYS(2004)+"samples\data\testdata.dbc"
   CREATE TABLE longname NAME "Long table name" (longfieldname c(20))

</PRE></OL>NOTE: The USE "long table name" command opens the table, but the name is
displayed with underscores instead of spaces in the View Window and in
SELECT commands, which require underscores instead of spaces.
<P>
Names of tables and fields abide by Rule 2. Rule 3 applies to variable
names but not to long table and field names, which can be no longer than
128 characters. This is documented in the help file under the "long table
names" and "fields, naming" topics.
<P>
When copying a table with a long table name and long field names, the long
table name is dropped and long field names are truncated to 10 characters.
If the first 10 characters of two fields are identical the second field
will be truncated to nine characters and the number 2 will be added at the
end. The long names are dropped or truncated because the COPY TO command
does not place the new table in the database, and long names are only
allowed when a table is part of a database.
<P>
The following copies the table that was created above:
<P>
<PRE>   COPY TO newtable

</PRE>No long table name exists because newtable is not part of the database, and
the longfieldname field is truncated to "longfieldn.
<P>
<P><h2>REFERENCES</h2>
 
<P>
NOTE: For more information about the RENAME TABLE command that allows
changes to be made to the long name of a table, please see the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
