The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Following is the content of the Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Help File located in the main Visual
FoxPro folder.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 

<OL><P><LI>What are the system requirements for Visual FoxPro?
<P>
    A Power Macintosh with a 601 PPC processor or later.
    8 MB RAM, 16 MB RAM recommended.
    80 MB available disk space (for full installation).
    Macintosh System 7.1.2 or later.

<P><LI>Can Visual FoxPro make executables?
<P>
    Visual FoxPro can create compact executables for Power Macintosh and
    Macintosh systems. Compact executables run against a support library
    that is optimized for each platform.

<P><LI>Which ODBC drivers ship with Visual FoxPro?
<P>
    Visual FoxPro ships with the Visigenic SQL Server ODBC driver only.
    Other drivers from third-party developers, such as Intersolv, are also
    available.

<P><LI>What OLE features does Visual FoxPro support?
<P>
    Visual FoxPro supports OLE Automation, including the linking and
    embedding of objects. It does not support In-Place Activation or Visual
    Editing.

<P><LI>How do I perform an Administrative Setup?
<P>
    You need to hold the COMMAND key down while you double-click the Setup
    icon. The initial screen you see has Administrative Setup in the
    title bar. This confirms that you have entered the Administrative Setup
    mode. The Setup program provides the necessary dialogs to guide you
    through an Administrative Setup.

<P><LI>Is there a Standard Edition of Visual FoxPro for Power Macintosh?
<P>
    Visual FoxPro for Power Macintosh is available in the Professional
    Edition only.

<P><LI>Can I share tables and databases with Visual FoxPro for Windows?
<P>
    Yes. Because of the common database and table format, sharing data
    across platforms is no different than multiple users sharing data on
    the same platform.

<P><LI>In Visual FoxPro for Power Macintosh, can I use .OCX controls such as
    the Outline or MAPI controls that came with Visual FoxPro for Windows?
<P>
    No. At the time of this release, OCXs are not supported on the
    Power Macintosh.

<P><LI>I want to use a bitmap that I ported from Windows, but on the
    Macintosh the bitmap does not display correctly. Why?
<P>
    Your bitmap was probably saved as an RLE encoded bitmap (a compressed
    Windows bitmap). You need to use a graphics program to convert the
    bitmap to an RGB encoded bitmap, or Macintosh PICT-type picture.

<P><LI>What is the recommended 68K Macintosh distribution platform?
<P>
    A Macintosh with a 68040 processor.
    8 MB RAM, 16 MB RAM recommended.
    Macintosh System 7.1.1 or later.

<P><LI>Do I need any additional licenses to distribute libraries with my
    applications?
<P>
    No. You don't need to obtain any additional licenses to distribute ASLM
    or CFM libraries. For more information on the Microsoft License
    Agreement, see the License Information text file in the Microsoft
    Visual FoxPro folder and the Distributable Files topic in Visual FoxPro
    Help.

<P><LI>Do I need any additional licenses to distribute Microsoft Graph with
    my applications?
<P>
    No. You don't need to obtain any additional licenses to distribute
    Microsoft Graph with your applications. For more information on the
    Microsoft License Agreement, see the License Information text file in
    the Microsoft Visual FoxPro folder and the Distributable Files topic in
    Visual FoxPro Help.

<P><LI>What compilers can I use to build CFMs for Visual FoxPro?
<P>
    Microsoft includes libraries for use with Microsoft Visual C++ 4.0
    Cross Compiler, Symantec C++, MetroWerks CodeWarrior Gold, and
    Macintosh Programmers Workshop.

<P><LI>What happened to the _BEAUTIFY system memory variable?
<P>
    The Beautify functionality is now integrated into the Documentation
    Wizard, accessed by choosing Wizards from the Tools menu.

<P><LI>Do I have to convert my version 2.x MLBs to CFMs?
<P>
    No. However, you have to recompile your version 2.x MLBs for use with
    Visual FoxPro 3.0 using the libraries provided in the API folder. For
    increased performance on the Power Macintosh, you can recompile MLBs
    into CFMs using the libraries provided.

<P><LI>How do I convert my Visual FoxPro 3.0 for Windows forms and reports?
<P>
    There is no formal transport process necessary. You simply open the
    forms and reports in the designers in Visual FoxPro for Power Macintosh
    and edit them directly. For conditional expression and bulk property
    changes, use the Transformer included in the Tools folder.

<P><LI>How can I control which version of FoxPro launches when I double-click
    a file?
<P>
    You can drag and drop the file directly on the application you would
    like to be launched. You can also keep one version of FoxPro per
    partition. Macintosh System Software maintains a desktop database per
    partition, and launches the most recent application per partition.
