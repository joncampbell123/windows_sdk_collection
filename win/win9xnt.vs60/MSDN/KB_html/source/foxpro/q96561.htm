<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS, versions 2.0 and 2.5
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Upon exiting Extended FoxPro for MS-DOS, the "FoxPro/LAN 2.0 - Normal
shutdown" message is displayed, and the system either hangs or reboots.
This problem may occur on every second exit of FoxPro, or the problem may
appear to be random.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem is caused by a combination of the following:

<UL><LI>There are HIMEM.SYS and DOS=HIGH statements in the CONFIG.SYS
   file, but you are not loading a memory manager such as
   EMM386.EXE.

<LI>You are running Extended FoxPro while Novell network drivers are
   loaded. (The problem occurs whether FoxPro is on the server or
   on the workstation.)

<LI>You are loading any of the following while in Extended FoxPro: a
   printer driver, a library file, or a BIN routine.
<P>
</UL>The workstation will reboot or hang after exiting FoxPro every second time
that all three of the above conditions are met. This problem will never
occur on the first exit.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in FoxPro versions 2.0 and 2.5
for MS-DOS. This problem was corrected in FoxPro version 2.5a for MS-DOS.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Any one of the following workarounds will solve the problem:

<UL><LI>Remove DOS=HIGH from the CONFIG.SYS file.

<LI>Leave DOS=HIGH in the CONFIG.SYS file, but add a memory manager
   such as EMM386.EXE.

<LI>Issue a RUN command, such as RUN&gt;NUL DIR, before exiting
   Extended FoxPro.

<LI>Run Standard FoxPro instead of Extended FoxPro.

<LI>Upgrade to FoxPro version 2.5a for MS-DOS or FoxPro version 2.5
   for Windows.

<LI>Edit GENPD.APP to use DRIVER.PRG instead of DRIVER2.PLB. (This
   will solve the problem only if DRIVER2.PLB is the only library
   file being used. If you are loading another library or a BIN
   routine, one of the remaining workarounds will be required.)
<P>
</UL>To modify GENPD.APP to use DRIVER.PRG instead of DRIVER2.PLB, do the
following:

<OL><P><LI>Open the GENPD.PJX file in the GOODIES\PDRIVERS subdirectory.

<P><LI>Edit GEN_PD.PRG.

<P><LI>From the Edit menu, choose Find, and search for "DRIVER.PRG".

<P><LI>Delete the asterisk from the following line:
<P>
<P><PRE>      * (_PDRIVER = "DRIVER.PRG").
</PRE>
<P><LI>Place an asterisk at the beginning of the next command line:
<P>
<P><PRE>      (_PDRIVER = "DRIVER2.PLB).
</PRE>
<P><LI>Close GEN_PD.PRG, saving the changes, and rebuild the project
   and application. (Note: Be sure to save GENPD.APP in the
   FOXPRO2 directory or in the directory returned by ?_GENPD.)
