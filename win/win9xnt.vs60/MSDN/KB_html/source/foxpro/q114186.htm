The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5, 2.5a, and 2.5b
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In FoxPro for Windows, when you combine the SET PRINTER ON command with the
??? command to output data to a printer, a blank page ejects prior to the
print job being sent.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When the SET PRINT ON command is issued, a print job is started. When the
??? command is issued, the current print job is closed, and a new raw print
job is opened.
<P>
In FoxPro for Windows, when a print job is opened and then closed, a blank
page will be printed even if no output was sent.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
In FoxPro for MS-DOS, create a printer driver using the Generic printer
settings. You can then use this printer driver in FoxPro for Windows.
<P>
To do this:

<OL><P><LI>Load FoxPro for MS-DOS. Set your resource (FOXUSER) file to the one that
   you will use for your FoxPro for Windows applications. If this is the
   resource file in your FoxPro for Windows directory and that directory is
   called FOXPROW and is located on drive C, type the following command:
<P>
<P><PRE>      SET RESOURCE TO c:\foxprow\foxuser
</PRE><P>
   Doing this ensures that the printer driver is stored in the correct
   resource file.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Printer Setup.

<P><LI>Select the Printer Driver Setup check box, and then choose New.

<P><LI>In the Printers list box, scroll down to the Generic Printer driver.

<P><LI>In the Setup Name box, type "Generic" (without the quotation marks),
   and then choose OK.

<P><LI>In the Printer Driver Setups dialog box, choose either Cancel or Set. It
   does not matter for the purpose of creating the printer driver.

<P><LI>In the Printer Setup dialog box, choose OK.

<P><LI>Exit FoxPro for MS-DOS. Load FoxPro for Windows. In the Command window,
   type:
<P>
<P><PRE>     SET PDSETUP TO "Generic"
     SET PRINTER ON
<PRE></PRE>     ??? ''                              &amp;&amp; Opens printer in 'raw' mode
     ? "I set the printer in raw mode"
     ??? CHR(27)+"(s3B"
     ? "I am printing bold"
     ??? CHR (27) + "(s0B"
     ? "Now it's not bold"
     SET PRINTER OFF
     SET PRINTER TO

<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 
<P>
The following code causes a blank page to eject prior to the print job that
is sent. It seems that the page eject occurs at the location of the first
??? command (that is, if you remove the first ??? command, the page eject
occurs after the first line of text is printed).
