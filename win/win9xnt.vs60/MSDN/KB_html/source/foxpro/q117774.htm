<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Macintosh uses three types of fonts: bitmap, TrueType, and PostScript.
TrueType and PostScript fonts are scalable fonts. Bitmap fonts are fixed-
size raster fonts.
<P>
In System 7.1, all fonts are located in the System Folder:Fonts folder.
<P>
<PRE>   Font type       Icon                     File kind/type
   --------------------------------------------------------

   Bitmap          Document with "A"        Font
   TrueType        Document with 3 "A"s     Font
   PostScript      Printer                  PostScript Font

</PRE>NOTE: The bitmap and TrueType font files may actually be located in a "font
suitcase" file. You will need to open the "font suitcase" file to view the
individual font files.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
You can see an example of any font by double-clicking the font file.
<P>
<P><h3>Bitmap Fonts</h3>
 
<P>
Bitmap fonts always have a specific font size included in their names (a
different bitmap font file is needed for each point size.) Their icons are
the document icon (a page with the top left corner turned over) containing
a single letter "A." Their file kind/type is Font. In System 7.0, they are
located in the System file; in System 7.1, they are in the System
Folder:Fonts folder.
<P>
<P><h3>TrueType Fonts</h3>
 
<P>
TrueType fonts also use document icons (a page with the top left corner
turned over). However, the icons contain three letter "A"s of different
sizes, which represents that the font is scalable. Their file kind/type is
Font. In System 7.0, they are located in the System file; in System 7.1,
they are in the System Folder:Fonts folder. TrueType fonts are located in
the same place as bitmap fonts.
<P>
<P><h3>PostScript Fonts</h3>
 
<P>
PostScript fonts use an icon of a printer, which shows a page coming out of
the top. The page will contain the number "1" or "3," which indicates
whether it is a Type 1 or Type 3 PostScript font. Their file kind/type is
PostScript Font. In System 7.0, they are located in the System
Folder:Extensions folder; in System 7.1, they are in the System
Folder:Fonts folder.
