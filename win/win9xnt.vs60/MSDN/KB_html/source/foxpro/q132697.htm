The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
A Visual FoxPro .EXE file appears briefly, and then it exits to the
operating system.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The main program is a screen or menu, and no READ EVENTS command has been
issued. In Visual FoxPro, the Command window provides a place for your
application to wait for the next command. Because the Command window is
unavailable in a run-time application, the .EXE file has no wait state to
anticipate keyboard input, so the application returns to the operating
system.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
A READ EVENTS command or a modal form will provide a wait state for your
application.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Adding a READ EVENTS to a menu</h3>
 
<P>
If the main program in your project is a menu, a READ EVENTS command should
be added to the menu as follows:

<OL><P><LI>In the Menu Builder on the View menu, click General options.

<P><LI>Select the Cleanup check box. In the Cleanup code window, add this code:
<P>
<P><PRE>      READ EVENTS
</PRE>
<P><LI>Add a Quit option to the menu that contains this command:
<P>
<P><PRE>      CLEAR EVENTS
</PRE><P>
</OL>If the main program in your project is a form or formset, there are several
ways to proceed as described in the remainder of this article.
<P>
<P><h3>Creating a Modal Form or Formset</h3>
 
<P>
The easiest way to provide a wait state for a form or formset is to set the
WindowType property to 1 - Modal at design time.
<P>
This may be undesirable if you want to run other forms from within the
current form or formset.
<P>
<P><h3>Creating a Program that Issues a Read Events</h3>
 
<P>
The form or formset can be run from within a program that issues a READ
EVENTS. For example:

<OL><P><LI>Create a program containing this code:
<P>
<P><PRE>      DO FORM &lt;formname&gt;
      READ EVENTS
</PRE>
<P><LI>Save this program, and make it the main program in your project.

<P><LI>Add a command button to the form. Add the following code in its Click
   event:
<P>
<P><PRE>      CLEAR EVENTS
      THISFORM.RELEASE
</PRE><P>
</OL><h3>Adding a READ EVENTS to a form or formset</h3>
 
<P>
If you do not want to create a wrapper program that runs the form and
issues a read events command, you can add the appropriate code to the form
or formset itself. For example:

<OL><P><LI>Add a new property to the form or formset named RdEventsFlag. Set the
   value of this property to false (.F.).

<P><LI>In the Activate method of the form or formset, add this code:
<P>
<P><PRE>      IF !THISFORM.RdEventsFlag
<PRE></PRE>         READ EVENTS
         THISFORM.RdEventsFlag = .T.
      ENDIF

</PRE><P><LI>Add a command button to the form. Add the following code to its click
   event:
<P>
<P><PRE>      CLEAR EVENTS
      THISFORM.RELEASE
</PRE><P>
</OL>Change THISFORM to THISFORMSET everywhere it appears if you are working
with a formset instead of a form.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create a quick form.

<P><LI>Create a new project, and add the form to the Documents tab.

<P><LI>Build an executable from the project.

<P><LI>Exit Visual FoxPro, and run the executable. The menu appears briefly;
   then the executable returns to the operating system shell.
