There are several differences between character mode (MS-DOS and UNIX)
and graphical (Windows and Macintosh) environments. FoxPro takes care
of these differences behind the scenes.
<P>
<P><h3>Fonts</h3>
 
<P>
MS-DOS uses a mono-spaced font based on the OEM (Original Equipment
Manufacturer) character set and Windows uses an ANSI character set with
fonts that are often proportionally spaced. FoxPro for Windows includes a
special font, FoxFont, which mimics the MS-DOS OEM character set. FoxFont
is automatically used when an MS-DOS application is run in FoxPro for
Windows.
<P>
<P><h3>One Line High Controls</h3>
 
<P>
FoxPro for MS-DOS controls do not match the size of FoxPro for Windows
controls. In many cases, MS-DOS controls are one line high. When an MS-DOS
application is run in FoxPro for Windows, a special one line high control
is used to match the one line high control in MS-DOS.
<P>
MS-DOS buttons running in Windows will look different than buttons in an
application that has been Transported into FoxPro for Windows.
<P>
<P><h3>Half Height Title Bars</h3>
 
<P>
All user-defined windows created in FoxPro for Windows are given a title
bar if they include any of the following clauses: TITLE, FLOAT, ZOOM,
MINIMIZE, or CLOSE. The same is not true of FoxPro for MS-DOS user-defined
windows. To reduce the visual differences between applications in the two
environments, a half height title bar is used for user-defined windows
unless the SYSTEM key word is included or the windows are created with the
FONT clause.
<P>
<P><h3>Box Positioning</h3>
 
<P>
Boxes are drawn using the box drawing characters in the FoxFont character
set instead of the Windows box drawing routines.
<P>
<P><h3>Centered Popup Labels</h3>
 
<P>
Popups in FoxPro for MS-DOS are three lines high and in FoxPro for Windows
are approximately one-and-one-half lines high. FoxPro for Windows
automatically centers the popup in the three lines when you run a FoxPro
for MS-DOS application.
