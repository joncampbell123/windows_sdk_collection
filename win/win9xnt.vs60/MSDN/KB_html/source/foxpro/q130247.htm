<P>
<P><h3>Overview of Oracle RDBMS</h3>
 
<P>
Oracle RDBMS is a multiuser relational database management system (DBMS)
that runs on a variety of workstation and minicomputer operating systems.
Structured Query Language (SQL) is used to access data in Oracle RDBMS. IBM
PCs and compatibles running Microsoft Windows communicate with Oracle7
database servers across a network such as Microsoft LAN Manager, Novell
NetWare, Banyan VINES, DECnet, or any TCP/IP network.
<P>
The Oracle7 driver enables applications to access data in an Oracle7
database through the Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) interface. It
communicates with the network through SQL*Net.
<P>
<P><h3>Application/Driver Architecture</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Application
</OL>2. ODBC Driver Manager (ODBC.DLL)
3. Oracle7 Driver (SQORA7.DLL)
4. OCI Layer (ORA7WIN.DLL)
5. SQL*Net Driver
6. Network Software (Microsoft LAN Manager, Novell NetWare, etc.
7. SQL*Net Listener
8. Oracle7 RDBMS
<P>
<P><h3>Driver Conformance Levels</h3>
 
<P>
The Oracle7 driver has the following conformance levels:

<UL><LI>API Conformance Level: Level 1
<LI>SQL Conformance Level: Minimum
<P>
</UL>NOTE: The Oracle7 driver also supports some of the functions in the level 2
API conformance level and almost all of the grammar in the core and
extended SQL conformance levels.
<P>
To determine the minimum conformance levels (if any), you must use drivers
with your application, see your application's documentation.
<P>
<P><h3>Hardware and Software Requirements</h3>
 
<P>
<P><h3>What You Must Have to Be Able to Access Oracle7 Data</h3>

later version of OCI has been installed. ORA7WIN.DLL is shipped with
SQL*Net for Windows.
<P>
<P><h3>Oracle7 RDBMS</h3>
 
<P>
To access data in an Oracle7 database with the Oracle7 driver, you must
have Oracle RDBMS version 7 or later. For information about the hardware
and software required by Oracle7 RDBMS, see the Oracle documentation.
<P>
<P><h3>Network Software</h3>
 
<P>
A network is required to connect the platforms on which Oracle7 RDBMS and
the Oracle7 driver reside. For information about the hardware and software
required by each network, see that network's documentation.
<P>
NOTE: If you are using Microsoft LAN Manager with the named pipes protocol,
it must be version 2.0 or later. If you are using Microsoft LAN Manager
with the TCP/IP protocol, it must be version 2.2 or later.
<P>
<P><h3>SQL*Net</h3>
 
<P>
The Oracle7 driver and Oracle7 RDBMS use SQL*Net as a common network
interface. You should be able to use the Oracle7 driver on any SQL*Net
connection from a computer running Windows to an Oracle7 database server.
For complete information about SQL*Net, see the SQL*Net documentation.
<P>
NOTE: SQL*Net components are available only from Oracle Corporation.
<P>
<P><h3>How to Set Up the Oracle7 ODBC Driver</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>If you have not already done so, install the ORACLE SQL*Net client
   components on your computer. If you want to test your ORACLE
   SQL*Net connection, set up your computer as an Oracle7 client
   workstation, and run SQL*Plus or NetTest. For information on how to
   do this, see the SQL*Net documentation.

<P><LI>Add a data source for each copy of Oracle7 RDBMS in which you want
   to access data.
<P>
</OL><h3>How to Set Up a New Version of the Oracle7 Driver</h3>

</OL>How to Add, Modify, and Delete Oracle7 Data Sources
 
<P>
Before you can access data with the Oracle7 driver, you must add a data
source for each of your copies of Oracle7 RDBMS. The Oracle7 driver uses
the information you enter when you add the data source to access the data.
You can change or delete a data source at any time.
<P>
How to Add an Oracle7 Data Source
 

<OL><P><LI>In the Main group in the Program Manager window, double-click the
   Control Panel icon. In the Control Panel window, double-click the
   ODBC icon.

<P><LI>In the Data Sources dialog box, choose the Add button. The Add Data
   Source dialog box is displayed.

   the SQL*NET Connect String information, which should be made available
   by the Network Administrator. The Description can be set to whatever you
   want. For more information about these options, press the Help button in
   the dialog box.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: To modify or delete the Oracle7 data source, highlight it in the Data
Sources dialog box, and then select the Setup or Delete options
respectively. For more information, select the Help option in the dialog
box.
<P>
<P><h3>How to Connect to an Oracle7 Data Source</h3>
 
<P>
To connect to a data source, the Oracle7 ODBC Driver requires that an
ORACLE SQL*Net driver be installed on your computer and the corresponding
ORACLE SQL*Net listener be running on the Oracle7 database server. ORACLE
SQL*Net for Windows is a Dynamic Linked Library (DLL)-based application.
For more information about ORACLE SQL*Net, see the ORACLE SQL*Net
documentation.
<P>
As part of the connection process, an application can prompt you for
information. If an application prompts you for information about an Oracle
data source, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>In the User Name box, type the name you use on Oracle7 RDBMS.
</OL>2. In the Password box, type the password you use on Oracle7 RDBMS.
3. Choose OK.
<P>
An application must connect to a data source to access data in it.
Different applications connect to data sources at different times. For
example, an application might connect to a data source only at your request
or it might connect automatically when it starts. For information about
when an application connects to a data source, see the documentation for
that application.
<P>
<P><h3>Troubleshooting "Message send failure"</h3>
 
<P>
The "Message send failure" error may occur when you're using Oracle7 with
Microsoft LAN Manager using TCP/IP protocol. On Microsoft LAN Manager using
the TCP/IP protocol, the number of bytes of data that can be sent to or
retrieved from Oracle7 RDBMS at one time is controlled by the MAXSENDSIZE
keyword in the [sockets] section of TCPUTILS.INI. If you receive a "Message
send failure" error, try increasing this value. This error is most likely
to occur when SQL_LONGVARCHAR or SQL_LONGVARBINARY data is being sent. For
more information, see the Oracle documentation.
