The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Anomaly Tracking System, version 1.0  included with:
   - Microsoft Visual Studio 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
You can distribute the Anomaly Tracking System (ATS) to your customers
to allow them to track anomalies in your applications that are written with
any of the Visual Studio development tools. Please read the license
agreement included in the Visual Studio box for licensing information.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To distribute ATS to your customers, you can use the following steps:
<P>
NOTE: If you have not made any customizations other than adding stored
procedures to the ATS database, you can use the setup that was used to
install Visual Studio on your machine.

<OL><P><LI>From the first Visual Studio CD-ROM, copy the ATS folder to a directory
   named ATSSETUP on your hard drive.

<P><LI>If you added stored procedures added-validation rules, copy all of
   the files from the directory that contains your databases to the
   ATSSETUP\ATS\SHARDATA directory. Click YES TO ALL when prompted to
   overwrite the files.

<P><LI>You can now use a compression utility to compress the files in the
   ATSSETUP directory and put them on disk.
<P>
</OL>If you have added tables to the database or created additional program
files, you cannot use the setup program described above. Instead, you will
have to use a setup creation utility to distribute the necessary files.
<P>
The following is a list of the files needed to distribute and the directory
they need to be placed in.
<P>
In the parent directory for the ATS:
<P>
<PRE>   ATS.CNT
   ATS.DAT
   ATS.EXE
   ATS.FPT
   ATS.HLP
   ATS.USR

</PRE></OL>In the WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory:
<P>
<PRE>   OLEAUT32.DLL
   OLEPRO32.DLL
   VFP500.DLL
   VFP5ENU.DLL

</PRE>If you want to provide the ability to create a new database, you need to
distribute all the files in the TEMPLATE directory and install it as a
child directory called TEMPLATE of the ATS parent directory.
<P>
NOTE: If you have made modifications to your database and you want the
ability to create new databases with your added features, you must also add
the functions to the FT database located in the TEMPLATE directory.
<P>

Anomaly Tracking System" using the ATS online Help system.
