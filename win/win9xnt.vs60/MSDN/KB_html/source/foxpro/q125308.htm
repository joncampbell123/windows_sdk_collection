The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.6 and 2.6a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
A report containing a variable name that has more than 10 characters can
cause a general protection (GP) fault when called from an executable
created with the FoxPro for Windows Distribution Kit. The GP fault occurs
even if no fields are present in the REPORT FORM.
<P>
The .EXE works properly when called from the Command window in the
development environment, but will cause a GP fault if run outside the
development environment from a directory where FoxPro is not installed. The
.EXE works correctly when run from the directory in which FoxPro is
installed.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Use report variable names that have 10 or fewer characters.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create a new report, and make a quick report.

<P><LI>Add a report variable that has a name containing 11 or more characters
   and store "" as the value.

<P><LI>Save the report as &lt;formname&gt;.FRX, and close it.

<P><LI>Create a new project, and add the report to project.

<P><LI>Create a program (.PRG file) that contains this line:
<P>
   REPORT FORM &lt;formname&gt; TO PRINTER

<P><LI>Add the .PRG file to the project, and set it as the main program.

<P><LI>Build the .EXE. Then exit from FoxPro, and run the .EXE file. Make sure
   the .EXE file is in a directory other than the FoxPro directory.

<P><LI>The result will be a GP fault.
