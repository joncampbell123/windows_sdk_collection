The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for UNIX, version 2.6
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When trying to run FoxPro for Unix under other than SCO Unix 3.2.2 or
later or SCO Xenix 2.3.4 or later, you may receive the error "Can't execute
binary file" or "Execute format error."
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The executable file, foxpro.pr, is designed specifically for the operating
system versions listed in the "Symptoms" section. Operation under other
operating systems or versions is not supported.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
There may be patches to the specific operating system that will allow
execution of programs written for SCO. For example, there are patches
available on the Internet FTP site TSX-11.MIT.EDU in directory
/pub/linux/BETA/ibcs2 that "patch" Linux to run SCO binaries. Other
derivatives of Unix may have similar patches available, and there are
various methods available (such as Archie) by searching the Internet for
sites offering such patches.
<P>
It is the responsibility of the user to install such patches to their
particular operating system. Whether FoxPro for Unix runs after the
installation of such patches or not, operation of FoxPro under other than
SCO Unix 3.2.2 (or later) or SCO Xenix 2.3.4 (or later) is not supported.
<P>
NOTE: The products mentioned in this article are manufactured by vendors
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise,
regarding these products' performance or reliability.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The executable file, foxpro.pr, contains calls specific to SCO Unix 3.2.2
(or later) or SCO Xenix 2.3.4 (or later).
