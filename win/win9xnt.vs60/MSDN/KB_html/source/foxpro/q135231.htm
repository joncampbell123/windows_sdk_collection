The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, version 2.6a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
While the FoxPro interface offers a number of dialog boxes that present a
list of fields from which sets can be chosen, the Browse menu options do
not permit fields to be specified. However, it is possible to construct a
Browse statement in the Command window containing a list of fields picked
through the interface, without resorting to programming. This article shows
you how.
<P>
NOTE: This method is not available from Catalog Manager.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Browse option is available from the following menu locations:

<UL><LI>On the Database menu, click Browse.

<LI>On the Window menu, click Work Area View and then Browse.
<P>
</UL>Both of these actions use the BROWSE LAST command, which you can see by
examining the Command window. If the resource file is enabled, the BROWSE
LAST command displays the fields and layout of the browse for the currently
selected table as it was last viewed.
<P>
To specify which fields are to be viewed in a browse, you must run the
BROWSE command from the Command window. Unfortunately, interactively
specifying more than a dozen or so fields in the Command window is a
tedious and time-consuming process. Also, under the following
circumstances, the entire command must re-entered to return the desired
results:

<UL><LI>The completed command is not saved in a program file before FoxPro is
   exited.

<LI>Different fields are required to be displayed.

<LI>The resource file is not enabled.
<P>
</UL>The following method is less elegant than most FoxPro solutions in that it
generates a harmless error, but its use during interactive sessions is
adequately warranted.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Interactively Create the Browse Field List</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Ensure that both the Command window and the database are open.

<P><LI>On the Database menu, click Append From.

<P><LI>In the From field, enter a non-existent filename such as ZZZ.

<P><LI>Click the Fields button, and select the desired fields.

<P><LI>Leave the File Type selected at the default: Table (DBF).

<P><LI>Optionally, select any desired Criteria.

<P><LI>Once all clauses have been specified, choose Append.

<P><LI>Press any key after the error "File 'zzz.dbf' does not exist."

<P><LI>In the Command window, select APPEND FROM ZZZ, and type BROWSE, and then
   Return.
<P>
</OL>Once the Browse has executed, the displayed fields can be modified by
scrolling up to the command in the Command window and locating the desired
fields in the Fields list.
