<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The object-oriented Visual FoxPro language extensions provide you with much
more control over the objects in your applications, at runtime as well as
design time. These extensions also make it easier to create and maintain
libraries of reusable code, giving you:
<P>
- The ability to quickly add complex functionality to application
<PRE>  components.

</PRE>- The ability to hide unnecessary complexity.
<P>
- Easier code maintenance through inheritance.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Quickly Add Complex Functionality To Application Components</h3>
 
<P>
You can create visual or non-visual classes with functionality made
accessible through methods and events. To incorporate this functionality,
you need only drag the class to a form. Code associated with events is
automatically run when the user interacts with the object. You can use a
method by writing a single line of code.
<P>
<P><h3>Hide Unnecessary Complexity</h3>
 
<P>
Because a class can encapsulate sophisticated functionality and only expose
the class through methods or events that occur in the user interface
elements, you don't have to worry about the internal operations of the
class. You need only be concerned with how to use the class as an
integrated whole.
<P>
<P><h3>Easier Code Maintenance Through Inheritance</h3>
 
<P>
Changes made to a parent class are inherited by all classes derived from
the class and all objects based on the class, unless the changed property,
method, or event procedure code has been overwritten at the lower level.
You can make a bug fix, a performance enhancement, or add functionality in
one place at the parent class level.
