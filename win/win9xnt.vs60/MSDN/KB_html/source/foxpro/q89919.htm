<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The following questions and answers pertain to printing issues.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 

<PRE>1. Q. When I try to print boxes, ASCII characters are printed
      instead of boxes. How can I correct this problem?

   A. In the Printer Setup dialog box, specify a printer setup
      appropriate for your printer. If you are already using a printer
      driver, modify the P_CODES database in order to send the proper
      code for your printer, and rebuild the GENPD.APP file. If you
      are not using a printer driver, send the proper escape codes to
      the printer before you print using the ??? command.

2. Q. I am using the Relational Query By Example (RQBE) system to
      send data to a report. The data in the report is incorrect; the
      report prints the same record over and over. How can I correct
      this problem?

   A. When you created the report, you used alias names in your field
      definitions. To modify the report, simply remove the alias
      names. For example, a field containing CUSTOMER.NAME should be
      modified to contain only NAME.

3. Q. Why can't I select the printer driver check box in the
      Printer Setup dialog box?

   A. This problem occurs if you are missing the GENPD.APP file, if
      the _GENPD memory variable is set incorrectly, if the resource
      file is turned off, or if the FOXUSER file is missing, damaged,
      or marked as read only.

4. Q. I am using a Novell network. I can print by using the Novell
      CAPTURE command, but the SET PRINTER TO \\SPOOLER command doesn't
      work. How can I correct this problem?

   A. If you are receiving the error message "Print not ready," make
      sure that there are no spaces after the \\SPOOLER section of this
      command. If the printer information does not print until you
      exit FoxPro, you must issue the command SET PRINT TO in order to
      release the print spooler.

5. Q. I cannot make the printer drivers work in an executable
      file. How can I correct this problem?

   A. Open the project to make sure that the GENPD.APP file is
      included in the project as an application. If it is not
      included, add GENPD.APP to the project as an application.

       NOTE: GENPD.APP is automatically marked as an excluded project
       element.

      Rebuild the project and your executable file. Make sure that you
      distribute the GENPD.APP, FOXUSER.DBF, FOXUSER.FPT, and
      FOXSWAP.COM files with your executable file. If you are
      distributing an Extended Version, also include PROAPI16.EXE in
      the project.
