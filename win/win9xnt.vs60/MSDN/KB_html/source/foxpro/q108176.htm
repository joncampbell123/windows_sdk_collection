3      Answers to Commonly Asked Questions
<P>
 
<P><h2>Part 1:  Knowledge Base Articles</h2>
 
<P>
If you installed the Knowledge Base articles, you can
view them by running KBVIEW.APP, a FoxPro for Windows
application installed in your FoxPro for Windows
directory.
 
<P>
 
<P><h2>Part 2:  Changes to Documentation Since Printing</h2>
 
<P>
The documentation refers to FoxPro 2.5. Substitute
FoxPro 2.5b wherever FoxPro 2.5 appears.
<P>
In the documentation, the FoxPro for Windows Distribution
Kit support file is called FOXW2500.ESL. The support file
name should be FOXW250B.ESL.
<P>
 
<P>
Chapter 1, page 5: Installation
<P>
This section incorrectly states that FOXW2500.ESL
(FOXW250B.ESL) and DKREADME.TXT are installed in the
Distribution Kit directory. These files are actually
installed in your FoxPro for Windows directory.
<P>
 
<P>
Chapter 2, page 12: Including FoxPro for MS-DOS
Printer Drivers
<P>
You should also include DRIVER2.FLL as a file if your
application requires FoxPro for MS-DOS printer drivers.
<P>
 
<P>
Chapter 2, page 13: Modifying the Main FoxPro Window
<P>
TITLE, a new FoxPro for Windows configuration file
(CONFIG.FPW) item, was not documented in this section.
<P>
If you select Close from your application's Control Menu
or Exit from the File menu, a message containing the text
in your application's title bar is displayed.
<P>
Include the TITLE configuration item to specify the
message displayed when you select either of these two
options. The title bar text is overridden by the text you
specify with the TITLE configuration item.
<P>
For example, the message "Exit MyApp" is displayed when
the following line is place in CONFIG.FPW:
<P>
TITLE = MyApp
<P>
 
<P>
Chapter 3, page 17: Adding an Icon to your .EXE File
<P>
The warning states that you cannot use the Program Item
Properties dialog in the Windows Program Manager to add
or change the icon for an .EXE file created with the
FoxPro for Windows Distribution Kit. This is not correct.
You can use the Program Item Properties dialog in the
Windows Program Manager to manipulate the icon for a .EXE
created with the Distribution Kit.

<P>
<P><h3>Questions and Answers</h3>
 
<P>
Question 1
<P>
Where does my application's executable (.EXE) file look for
FOXW250B.ESL?
<P>
Answer 1
<P>
The executable file looks for FOXW250B.ESL, the FoxPro for
Windows Support Library, in the following locations in
this order:

<OL><P><LI> In the directory from which the .EXE is run.

<P><LI> In the current working directory.

<P><LI> Along the MS-DOS path.
</OL> 
<P>
Question 2
<P>
If my application uses the RUN command to execute external
MS-DOS programs, where should I put FOXRUN.PIF?
<P>
Answer 2
<P>
Place FOXRUN.PIF in the same directory as the FOXW2500.ESL
file. This is usually the root directory of the directory
structure containing the files you want on your
distribution diskettes.
 
<P>
Question 3
<P>
How do I pass parameters to my application's executable
file (.EXE)?
<P>
Answer 3
<P>
The first line of your application's main program must be
a PARAMETERS statement to accept the parameters you pass.
For example, the following PARAMETERS statement can be
used to accept two parameters:
<P>
PARAMETERS mparam1, mparam2
<P>
You can specify the parameters that are passed to your
application's .EXE file when you use the SetupWizard to
create your setup routine. Specify the parameters in the
screen where the SetupWizard asks you for the name
of your application. If you specify more than one
parameter, separate the parameters with a space. If a
parameter contains an embedded space, place double
quotation marks (" ") around the parameter.
<P>
You can also specify parameters to pass to the
application's .EXE file by selecting the application's
icon and choosing Properties... from the Program Manager
File menu. Enter the parameters to pass to the .EXE file
in the Command Line text box.
 
<P>
Question 4
<P>
My application uses FoxFont. Where do I put the FoxFont
file FOXFONT.FON?
<P>
Answer 4
<P>
Place FOXFONT.FON in the same directory as the
FOXW2500.ESL file. This is usually the root directory of
the directory structure containing the files you want on
your distribution disks.
 
<P>
Question 5
<P>
Our organization includes several FoxPro developers. Does
each developer need an individual copy of the Distribution
Kit?
<P>
Answer 5
<P>
Your organization must own one licensed copy of the
Distribution Kit per developer, for each developer
creating applications for distribution. If five developers
in your organization create applications for distribution,
you must own five licensed copies of the Distribution Kit.
 
<P>
Question 6
<P>
What type of applications (single or multiuser) can be
built with the Distribution Kit?
<P>
Answer 6
<P>
You can build all types of applications (single or
multiuser) with the FoxPro 2.5b for Windows Distribution
Kit. While the FoxPro 2.0 version required separate
license agreements for single user, multiuser, and so
on, the development version of FoxPro 2.5b no longer
makes these distinctions. However, as mentioned in the
previous answer, in order to be legal, you must own one
licensed copy of the FoxPro 2.5b for Windows Distribution
Kit for each developer creating FoxPro 2.5b for Windows
applications for distribution.
 
<P>
Question 7
<P>
I have a question regarding the legal requirements for
reselling applications developed with FoxPro. Let's say
that, as a FoxPro developer, I write a program for
Client A. I compile the program as a compact .EXE file
and give the application to Client A, together with
the FOXW250B.ESL support library file with which to run
the application. Client A owns the application and the
copyright. Client A then sells the application
commercially to many other people.
<P>
A) Does Client A also have to purchase the FoxPro
<PRE>   Distribution Kit, even though Client A will never use
   the Distribution Kit themselves?

</PRE></OL>B) Does Client A have to purchase the FoxPro 2.5b
<PRE>   development version?

</PRE>Answer 7
<P>
A) No, Client A does not need to purchase the Distribution
<PRE>   Kit. Only the developer who uses the Distribution Kit
   to build the original .EXE file must own a licensed
   copy of the Distribution Kit.

</PRE>B) Client A does not have to purchase FoxPro 2.5b, since
<PRE>   the client is not building their own .EXE file;
   Client A is just a reseller. Client A must distribute
   the application in its original form, however, and
   cannot remove the runtime files to include it with
   another application.
</PRE> 
<P>
Question 8
<P>
Should I distribute FOXPRO.INT with my application?
<P>
Answer 8
<P>
We recommend that you include FOXPRO.INT, the FoxPro
international file that provides additional collation
sequence and code page support, with your distributed
application. You must include FOXPRO.INT with your
application if it uses a collation sequence other than
MACHINE or is run on multiple FoxPro platforms.
<P>
Place FOXPRO.INT in the root directory of the directory
structure containing the files you want on your
distribution disks.
