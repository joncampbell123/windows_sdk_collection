The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS, version 2.6
<LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, version 2.6
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The online Help file for FoxPro 2.6 for Windows and FoxPro 2.6 for MS-DOS
contains incorrect information about commands that support the new LIKE and
EXCEPT clauses. The Help file incorrectly indicates that certain commands
can accept the LIKE and EXCEPT clauses. The Help file also fails to
document certain commands that do accept these clauses. This article
explains the differences between the documented and observed behavior for
these commands.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
According to the Help file, the following commands can accept LIKE or
EXCEPT clauses. The Help file is incorrect. These commands do not support
the LIKE and EXCEPT clauses:
<P>
<PRE>   APPEND FROM
   CREATE REPORT - Quick Report
   CREATE SCREEN - Quick Screen
   LIST
   TOTAL

</PRE>According to the Help file, the following commands do not accept LIKE or
EXCEPT clauses. The Help file is incorrect. These commands do support the
LIKE and EXCEPT clauses:
<P>
<PRE>   BLANK
   REPLACE FROM ARRAY
   SET FIELDS

</PRE>For more information about the LIKE and EXCEPT clauses, see the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../foxpro/q114702.htm">Q114702</A></B>
   TITLE     : How to Use the LIKE and EXCEPT Clauses

</PRE><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Use the following code to create a table that can be used to  test the
   behavior of the commands:
<P>
<P><PRE>      CREATE TABLE 'test' (afld  C(5), bfld  C(5))
      INSERT INTO test (afld, bfld) VALUES ('afld', 'bfld')
      COPY TO test2
</PRE>
<P><LI>Execute the following commands. According to the Help file, each of
   these commands should support the LIKE and EXCEPT clauses. Each line of
   code shown below, however, will produce a "Syntax Error" message.
<P>
<P><PRE>     CREATE REPORT test FROM test FIELDS LIKE a*
     CREATE SCREEN test FROM test FIELDS LIKE a*
     APPEND FROM test2 FIELDS LIKE a*
     LIST FIELDS LIKE a*
     TOTAL TO testx ON IIF(afld="A",1,2) FIELDS LIKE a*
</PRE>
<P><LI>Execute the following commands. According to the Help file, none of
   these commands should support the LIKE and EXCEPT clauses. Each line of
   code shown below, however, will accept the LIKE and EXCEPT clauses:
<P>
<P><PRE>     BLANK FIELDS LIKE b*
     PUBL ARRA atest[2,2]
     atest = "TT"
     REPLACE FROM ARRAY atest FIELDS LIKE a*
     SET FIELDS TO ALL LIKE a*
