The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.6, 2.6a
<LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When using the @ SAY command to play an .avi file that is stored in a
general field in FoxPro, the location of where the general field is played
does not obey the coordinates set by the @ SAY command. The position of
where it is played changes each time the @ SAY is used.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Look in the MORE INFORMATION section and use the article listed there to
play an .avi file.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Using the @ SAY command, you can play an .avi file that has been stored in
a general field. Issuing the command below:
<P>
<PRE>   @ 1,1 SAY &lt;general field name&gt; VERB "play"

</PRE>Issuing the command several times shows that the general field is displayed
at a different location on the screen each time the command is issued.
Since the @ SAY coordinates are "1,1", the general field should play in the
upper-left corner of the screen each time. This behavior is evident whether
using FoxPro for Windows 2.x or Visual FoxPro for Windows 3.0 and 5.0 on
any operating system.
<P>
For more information about playing an .avi file, please see the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : How to Play an .AVI File Using FoxPro for Windows

</PRE><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create a table with a general field.

<P><LI>Add a record to the table and open the general field by clicking on
   the word "gen" in a Browse window of the table or by issuing a MODIDY
   GENERAL {general field name} as a command.

<P><LI>Choose the Edit menu pad and select the Insert Object menu bar.

<P><LI>If using FoxPro for Windows 2.x, follow these steps:
<P>
   a. Select either "Movie Clip (AVI) or "Media Clip" from the Insert
<P><PRE>      Object box and click OK.
</PRE><P>
   b. From the File menu, select Open.
<P>
   c. Locate the .avi file that is to be placed in the general field and
<P><PRE>      click Open.
</PRE><P>
   d. The .avi file now appears and after clicking the File menu and
<P><PRE>      selecting Update FoxPro, the .avi file appears in the general field.
</PRE><P>
   e. Close the movie or media player, the general field, and the Browse
<P><PRE>      window.
</PRE><P>
   If using Visual FoxPro, follow these steps:
<P>
   a. Select the "Create from File" radio button and search for the file
<P><PRE>      with the Browse button.
</PRE><P>
   b. Click OK and close the Browse window.

<P><LI>At the Command window, issue the following command:
<P>
<P><PRE>      @ 1,1 SAY &lt;general field name&gt; VERB "play"
</PRE><P>
</OL>Note the position of the screen where the .avi file plays. Run the command
again and observe that the position changes each time that the command is
issued.
