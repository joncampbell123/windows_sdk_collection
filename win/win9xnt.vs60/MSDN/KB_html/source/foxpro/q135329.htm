The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If procedure code is short enough that all code fits in a single page of
the Code Window, pressing the PAGE UP or PAGE DOWN key moves to the
previous or next populated procedure rather than moving to the beginning or
end of the currently edited procedure.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Press CTRL+HOME or CTRL+END to move to the beginning or end of the
currently edited procedure.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem has been fixed in
Visual FoxPro 5.0 for Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create a form.

<P><LI>Type the following two lines in the Code window for the Init procedure
   of the form:
<P>
   This.Height=300
   This.Width=500

<P><LI>Type the following two lines in the Code window for the DblClick
   procedure of the form:
<P>
   WAIT WINDOW STR(This.Height) TIMEOUT 1
   WAIT WINDOW STR(This.Width) TIMEOUT 1

<P><LI>Double-click the upper-left corner of the Code window to close it.

<P><LI>Open the DblClick Procedure by double-clicking anywhere on the form in
   the Form Designer.

<P><LI>Press the PAGE DOWN key.
<P>
</OL><h3>Notes</h3>
 

<UL><LI>The actual behavior is that the next populated procedure (in this case,
   the Init Procedure) is displayed in the Code Window.

<LI>The insertion point should advance to the end of the current procedure
   when you first press PAGE DOWN and to the beginning of the next
   populated procedure when you next press PAGE DOWN.

<LI>If the procedure code fills more than one page in the Code window, the
   first time you press PAGE DOWN will move the pointer to the beginning of
   the next page of the current procedure, as expected.

<LI>Pressing PAGE UP when at the end of a procedure should move the pointer
   to the beginning of the current procedure. Instead, it displays the
   previously populated procedure. If, however, the pointer is on page 2 or
   higher of a procedure that is longer than a page in the Code Window, the
   pointer moves to the previous page of the current procedure.

<LI>Pressing CTRL+END moves the pointer to the end of the current procedure,
   and pressing CTRL+HOME moves the pointer to the beginning of the current
   procedure. These behaviors occur regardless of the length of the
   procedure in the Code Window.
