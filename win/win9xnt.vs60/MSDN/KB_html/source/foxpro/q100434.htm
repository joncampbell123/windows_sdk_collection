The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5 and 2.5a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
SETUP /N fails with the error message "Cannot change attributes of file
DDEML.DLL" during a workstation installation of FoxPro for Windows when
Windows is being shared from the network.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
SETUP /N fails because users trying to perform the workstation installation
do not have full rights to the Windows SYSTEM subdirectory on the network
server. To complete the network installation, users must have full rights
to this directory because SETUP /N performs three basic operations:

<UL><LI>Updates dynamic-link library (DLL) files for the copy of Windows that is
   currently running. These files are located in the Windows SYSTEM
   subdirectory on the network and therefore require users to have FULL
   privileges to the server in order to update them.

<LI>Copies the FOXUSER.DBF and FOXUSER.FPT files to the destination
   directory (specified by the user).

<LI>Creates the FoxPro group window and icons in Program Manager.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To perform a workstation installation of FoxPro for Windows, do one of the
following:

<UL><LI>Connect to the shared FoxPro directory on the network and run SETUP /N.
   (Each user MUST have FULL rights to the shared Windows directory.)
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Connect to the shared FoxPro directory and manually copy the FOXUSER.DBF
   and FOXUSER.FPT files and create the FoxPro group window and icons in
   Program Manager on each workstation.
<P>
   NOTE: The DLLs must still be updated, but this can be done by the system
   admininistrator by either running SETUP /N once, or by manually copying
   the DLL files from the FOXPROW directory to the Windows SYSTEM
   subdirectory.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
