</PRE><P><LI> Q. Are my existing FoxPro 2.0 screens and reports compatible with
<P><PRE>       FoxPro 2.5?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. The structure of the databases created by the Power Tools have
       changed in FoxPro 2.5. When you first open files of these
       types, FoxPro 2.5 converts them to FoxPro 2.5 format (with your
       permission). This conversion is a one-way process--files that
       have been converted to 2.5 formats can no longer be opened in
       2.0.  You may want to make backups before converting.  For more
       information about specific FoxPro 2.5 file formats, see the
       "Tables" chapter in the "Update Guide."
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. Can existing library files created with the FoxPro 2.0 Library
<P><PRE>       Construction Kit be used in FoxPro 2.5?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. Library files created with the FoxPro 2.0 Library Construction
       Kit must be relinked before they can be used in FoxPro 2.5. If
       you purchased a library, contact the vendor that originally
       provided the library for information on an updated version.  If
       you have the original source code for the library, just relink
       the library.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. I have some existing programs compiled under FoxPro 2.0.  Are
<P><PRE>       they compatible with FoxPro 2.5?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. Programs compiled under FoxPro version 2.0, such as .APPs and .FXPs,
       are not compatible with FoxPro version 2.5. To run such programs in
       FoxPro version 2.5, you must rebuild them. For information about
       rebuilding FoxPro version 2.0 applications, see the section "Using
       Files from Other Platforms" in the "Update Guide."
