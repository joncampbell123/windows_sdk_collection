<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0
<LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5, 2.5a, 2.6a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
FoxPro for Windows will only send data with a precision of two decimal
places to Microsoft Graph. In other words, numeric fields that contain
more than two decimal places will be rounded to just two places. The
settings for the SET DECIMALS TO and SET FIXED commands have no
effect on this behavior.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is caused by a limitation in the way that the
GraphWizard sends data to MS Graph.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in
Visual FoxPro for Windows version 3.0b.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The results of a query in the RQBE window can be sent to a graph by
selecting Graph from the Output list box. The GraphWizard then takes
over and provides direction on the creation of the graph/chart.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create a new database that has one character field and two numeric
   fields. The fields can have the default width of ten. However, make
   sure the numeric fields have three decimal places.

<P><LI>Add three records to the database. In the character field, enter
   the letters A, B, and C. Enter any number for the numeric fields,
   as long as it has three decimal places. (NOTE: The third decimal
   place should not be zero.)

<P><LI>In the Command window, issue the following command:
<P>
<P><PRE>      USE &lt;database&gt;
</PRE>
<P><LI>From the Run menu, choose New Query. In the Output list box, select
   Graph.

<P><LI>Choose Do Query. The GraphWizard will take over and provide
   guidance on the creation of the chart. For purposes of reproducing
   this problem, choose Next three times. You should now be at the
   screen that says "Here's your graph!"

<P><LI>Choose the Zoom button to open the graph in a window by itself.
   Double-click the graph to start up MS Graph.
<P>
   When MS Graph is open, there will be two windows. The graph will be
   in a window in front and will say "FoxPro(####)-Chart" in the title
   bar. The window in the background will contain the datasheet and
   will say "FoxPro(####)-Datasheet" in the title bar.

<P><LI>Activate the Datasheet window. Select (highlight) the cells that
   contain numbers either by using the mouse or by using the arrow
   keys while holding down the SHIFT key.

<P><LI>From the Format menu, choose Number. In the Format box at the
   bottom of the dialog box, type "0.000" (without the quotation
   marks). This is a custom number format that will display three
   decimal places. Choose OK.
<P>
</OL>The datasheet for the graph will now display the numbers with three
decimal places. Note that the third decimal place is always zero. The
numbers have been rounded. You can manually enter additional decimal
places in Graph, but they will not automatically transfer over from
FoxPro due to the limitation in the GraphWizard.
