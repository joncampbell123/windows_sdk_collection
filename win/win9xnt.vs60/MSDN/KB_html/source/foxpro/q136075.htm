</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the SET SKIP OF command to disable a menu title or bar created
using the Menu Builder, you may find the commands have no effect on your
menu. This is because of the naming convention Visual FoxPro uses to name
the objects in your menu. This article explains how to disable a menu title
or bar successfully.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you run a user-created menu using the DO MYMENU.MPR syntax (using the
name Mymenu as an example), Visual FoxPro sets your menu to the system
variable _MSYSMENU. Hence, using syntax such as SET SKIP OF MENU MYMENU .T.
fails to disable your menu. Visual FoxPro now sees your menu as the
_MSYSMENU, so you could successfully disable your menu by using this
syntax:
<P>
<PRE>   SET SKIP OF MENU _MSYSMENU.

</PRE>Similarly, you would find it impossible to disable a menu title named QUIT
using syntax such as SET SKIP OF PAD quit OF MYMENU. Visual FoxPro assigns
a variable name to both the menu title and the menu, so without referencing
the correct name, this syntax fails. Your menu is now known to Visual
FoxPro as _MSYSMENU, that part you can fix. But you still don't know the
name of the menu title or bar.
<P>
There are two ways to overcome this problem.

<UL><LI>When you create your menu in the Menu Builder, you can specify a
   meaningful name. To find the appropriate dialog box, modify your menu.
   Click the Options button for the title or bar you want to name. The
   Prompt Options dialog box appears. Select the Pad Name (Bar # if you are
   editing a bar) text box. The Pad Name (Bar Number if you are editing a
   bar) dialog box appears. Enter a name that has meaning to you.

<LI>After you generate your menu, you can open the .mpr file that was
   created and find the variable name Visual FoxPro assigned to each item
   in your menu. These variable names for the pads are a series of random
   numbers and letters preceded by an underscore character. They look
   something like this: _r3210vobi. With these system-generated names, you
   can reference the menu titles (pads) and bars in your commands. Bars are
   sequentially numbered under each pad and may be referred to in the
   following way. set skip of bar 1 of _rlq0jcc27 .t. _rlq0jcc27 is the
   menu generated name for the pad.
