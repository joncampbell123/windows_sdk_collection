The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows version 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In earlier versions of FoxPro, it was difficult to add a custom label size.
Although Visual FoxPro ships with the most common styles of Avery labels,
it may still be necessary to add your own custom label size. This article
shows you how.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
With Visual FoxPro, it's easy to add a new, custom label size to your
application. The following steps, taken from the online Help, outline this
process.
<P>
If you don't see a label size that you need in the Label Designer, you can
add label sizes to the New Label dialog box by adding new sizes to the
resource file that populates the dialog box. The name of the resource file
box is stored in the configuration file. By default, the configuration file
is CONFIG.FPW.
<P>
To add a label size:

<OL><P><LI>From the Program menu, choose Do.

<P><LI>From the Visual FoxPro directory, select ADDLABEL.APP.

<P><LI>In the box, enter the path and name for the resource file.
<P>
   NOTE: If you do not know the resource file's name and location, type ?
   SYS(2005) in the Command window to display the file's name and path in
   the main Visual FoxPro window.

<P><LI>In the Add Label dialog box, select Create New Label Layout.

<P><LI>In the Create New Label Layout dialog box, enter the information
   for the label.

<P><LI>Choose Add This Layout. Visual FoxPro adds the new label to the resource
   file and to the table LABELS.DBF.

<P><LI>If you want to add another label size, choose Create New Label Layout.
   If you want to stop adding labels, choose Cancel.
<P>
</OL>In addition to the foregoing information from the help file, the following
are some items you should be aware of about labels.
<P>
<P><h3>Existing Labels in Resource File</h3>
 
<P>
Visual FoxPro doesn't check to see if label definitions already exist in
the current resource file. Consequently, pressing the 'Add Labels to
Resource File' button repeatedly will add the same 86 present label
definitions to the resource file. When you go to select a label layout, you
will see each definition repeated however many times you pressed the
button. The easiest way to recover from this is to delete your resource
file, but if this is not feasible, you will need to issue a SET RESOURCE
OFF, use the resource file, and then manually delete the unwanted label
entries.
<P>
<P><h3>Adding a Label</h3>
 
<P>
The following information documents some of the points to remember when
creating a new label layout.

<UL><LI>Measurements: Label measurements are in increments of 1/10,000 of an
   inch and can either be shown in standard U.S. or metric format.

<LI>Layout Names: Layout names can contain any valid characters and can be
   up to 24 characters in length. The layout name is the internal reference
   to the label in the resource file and will not appear in your list of
   label layouts. The ID for a label layout in the resource file is
   LABELLYT and the TYPE is DATAW.

<LI>Description: The description of your label is what will appear in the
   list of available labels. You can enter a label description in this
   fashion:
<P>
   4144 1-2/3" 3" 3
<P>
   Or you can follow the label template shown on the label entry screen of
   how the actual label description should be entered. If the template is
   followed, the same entry would appear like this:
<P>
<PRE>   4144     1-2/3"      3"      3

   When entering a label description, use spaces to align the values for
   the label.

</PRE><LI>Measurement Entries: It is not necessary to enter the leading zeroes to
   the measurements. However, you must enter a value for all measurement
   fields.
<P>
</UL>When you finish adding the new label layout, click the Add This Layout
button. Your new entry will be added to both your currently-defined
resource file (FOXUSER.DBF or .FPT by default) and to the default layout
file.
<P>
In the event that your resource file ever becomes corrupt, you can recover
by reruning the ADDLABEL.APP program to add back in the standard and custom
label definitions. After you finish adding labels, choose the Cancel button
from the Add Label dialog box.
<P>
<P><h3>Distributing Labels with Your Application</h3>
 
<P>
Because label layouts are stored in your resource file, you must also
distribute the resource file with your application so your users have
access to the standard and custom label definitions.
