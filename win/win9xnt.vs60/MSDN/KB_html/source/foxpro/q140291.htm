<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
You can create a Chart in Microsoft Graph from the data in the currently
selected work area by calling the Graph Wizard programmatically.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To create a Chart programmatically, use this syntax:
<P>
<PRE>   SELECT &lt;table to be graphed&gt;
   DO (_GENGRAPH) WITH &lt;parm1&gt; [,&lt;parm2] [,&lt;parm3]...[,&lt;parm9&gt;].

</PRE>NOTE: If DO command listed above causes the error "File does not exist," an
alternative command is:
<P>
<PRE>    DO HOME() + 'wizards\wzgraph.app' WITH &lt;parm1&gt; [,&lt;parm2] ... [,&lt;parm9&gt;]

</PRE>IMPORTANT: this code will not work in an executable run outside of Visual
FoxPro. The Graph Wizard will always take its data from the currently
selected table.
<P>
The Graph Wizard application (Wzgraph.app) accepts these parameters:
<P>
<PRE>   parm1 - "AUTOGRAPH" (required)
   parm2 - chart type (numeric)
   parm3 - chart subtype (numeric)
   parm4 - title (character)
   parm5 - series by row / column (logical)
   parm6 - has legend (logical)
   parm7 - use autoformat (logical)
   parm8 - output DBF (character)
   parm9 - don't display graph with MODIFY GENERAL (logical)

</PRE><h3>How the Parameters Interact with Each Other</h3>
 
<P>
Parm1 - "AUTOGRAPH"
<P>
If a character string other than "AUTOGRAPH" is specified, Visual FoxPro
will present either Step 1 (if no table is open) or Step 2 of the
interactive Graph Wizard. If you use "AUTOGRAPH" and no table is open, the
Graph Wizard returns an error, if a table is open, the resulting behavior
depends on the value of parm8.
<P>
Parm8 - output DBF
<P>
<PRE>If Parm8 is omitted or empty (for example, "   "), you will be prompted for
</PRE>an output file name. If you supply the name of an output file, it must be
an existing .dbf file that contains a General field. If the file does not
exist, the Graph Wizard returns this error:
<P>
<PRE>   The table you selected is already in use.

</PRE>WARNING: If the file exists, but does not contain a General field, the file
is deleted and replaced with a new table of that name containing a single
record with a single General field that contains the Graph object. Each
call to (_GENGRAPH) with the same file name in parm8 adds a new record to
the table and places the generated graph in the General field.
<P>
Parm7 - use autoformat
<P>
The value of this parameter influences how the numbers passed to parm2
and parm3 are interpreted.
<P>
Parm2 - chart type and parm3 - chart subtype
<P>
If parm7 is true (.T.), parm2 will be 1-15 corresponding to the options in
the Gallery list that is displayed when you click AutoFormat on the Format
menu in MSGraph. Parm3 will be the number of the selected format displayed
for the specific Gallery selected.
<P>
If parm7 is false (.F.), parm2 will be 1-14 corresponding to the chart
types that are displayed when you click Chart Type on the Format menu in
MSGraph. The first 1-8 are the 2-D charts (counted from left to right and
top to bottom), 9-14 are the 3-D chart types. Parm3 will be one of the
Subtypes that are displayed when you click the Options button in the Chart
Type window. Valid numbers depend on which Chart Type is specified.
<P>
Parm4 - title.
<P>
This is the title that will appear on the chart. If left empty or omitted,
the chart will have no title. This is the same as setting the ChartTitle
property of the chart.
<P>
Parm5 - series by row /column
<P>
This is the equivalent to clicking either Series in Rows or Series in
Columns on the Data menu in MSGraph. True (.T.) indicates Series in Rows,
and false (.F.) indicates Series in Columns. These settings are explained
in the Microsoft Graph Help file.
<P>
Parm6 - has legend
<P>
If this is true (.T.), the chart displays a legend. This is the same as
setting the HasLegend property of the chart.
<P>
Parm9 - don't display graph with MODIFY GENERAL
<P>
If this is false (.F.) the General field is displayed in a window as though
the MODIFY GENERAL command had been issued.
