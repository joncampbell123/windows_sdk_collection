<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, version 2.6
<LI>Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS, version 2.6
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The information below describes the Screen Wizard and lists the steps to
create a screen.
<P>
This information is also found in FoxPro online Help in the "Screen Wizard"
topic.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Screen Wizard creates a FoxPro screen you can use to view and modify
the information in your tables. The screen includes a series of buttons for
displaying, editing, and printing records. You can choose from three
different styles of screens, and have your choice of buttons with text
labels, such as "Next" or "Top," or buttons with pictures that represent
each button's function.
<P>
NOTE: If you want your screens to work in a multiuser environment, you
need to make sure that you set the EXCLUSIVE option to OFF. You can change
this setting from the Catalog Manager by choosing the Settings command from
the Tools menu. If you are not using the Catalog Manager, type SET
EXCLUSIVE OFF in the Command window.
<P>
<P><h3>Screen Wizard Steps</h3>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Step 1 of 5:  Selecting a Table</h3>
 
<P>
NOTE: If you start the wizard from the Catalog Manager, this step is
skipped because you have already selected a table to work with.
<P>
Select a table from the list (which shows all the tables in use before you
started the wizard). If no names are displayed, or you want to use a
different table, choose the Open... button and use the Open dialog to
select a table.
<P>
<P><h3>Step 2 of 5:  Selecting Fields to Include in Your Screen</h3>
 
<P>
To select fields from a table to use in your screen, you can:

<UL><LI>Double-click each field name in the Available Fields box.

<LI>Select each field name and choose the Add button.

<LI>Choose the Add All button to use all the fields.
<P>
</UL>If you add a field you don't need, select it and choose the Remove button.
<P>
<P><h3>Step 3 of 5:  Setting the Sort Order</h3>
 
<P>
NOTE: This step will be skipped if you are basing your screen on a query.
<P>
To set the order in which records will be displayed in the screen, select
up to three fields from the Available Fields list. The selected fields are
combined to create an index tag.
<P>
For example, if you choose State and then City, when you view your records
in the finished screen, they will be sorted by state, and then by city
within each state.
<P>
Choose the Ascending option to view records from the beginning of the
alphabet, the lowest number, or the earliest date; choose the Descending
option to view records from the end of the alphabet, the highest number, or
the latest date.
<P>
<P><h3>Step 4 of 5:  Selecting a Style for the Screen and Its Buttons</h3>
 
<P>
Select a style option for the screen from the list of styles.
<P>
FoxPro for Windows Only: Then, select the type of navigation and editing
buttons (text or pictures) you want to appear along the bottom of the
screen.
<P>
<P><h3>Step 5 of 5:  Naming the Screen and Saving, Running, or Modifying It</h3>
 
<P>
Enter the title you want to appear at the top of your new screen, then
select one of the three options, and choose the Finish button:

<UL><LI>Save Screen For Later Use creates an .SCX file that you can later
   use to generate and then run the screen.

<LI>Save And Run Screen creates and generates the screen, and displays
   it so you can view, modify, or print records.

<LI>Modify Screen With Design Tool displays the Save As dialog so you
   can give the table a name, then displays the screen in the Screen
   Design window, so you can modify it as needed.
<P>
</UL><h3>Wizard-Generated Screens</h3>
 
<P>
The screens created by the wizard include the screen title and the fields
you chose to include.
<P>
<P><h3>Wizard-Generated Screen Buttons</h3>
 
<P>
The buttons at the bottom of the screen work as follows:
<P>
<PRE>Button      Function
------      --------

            query.

            displayed. Choose Save when you are done editing, or

Print       Displays a dialog box so you can print the current record,
            or all the records in the table. The wizard creates a
            report with the same name as the screen. You can preview
            the report, or send it directly to the printer.

Close       Closes the screen.
