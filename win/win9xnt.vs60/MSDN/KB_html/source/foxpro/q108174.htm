<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Below is the complete GETANS.TXT file found in the GOODIES\FNDATION
subdirectory.
<P>
NOTE: This file answers eight questions asked in the GETLESS.TXT file
about the EX1.APP application and how it implements a foundation READ.
Both the EX1.APP and GETLESS.TXT files are located in the GOODIES\FNDATION
subdirectory.

<P><h3>Answers to READ/Window/Menu Quiz</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>You would add one READ level each time you selected an application from
   the menu and, therefore, would get 'Too many READs in effect." in short
   order.

<P><LI>Because the procedure 'menuhit' is contained within EX1.MPR which is not
   part of EX1.PRG.

<P><LI>It's found in function 'stopread' which is evaluated each time an
   application window is DEACTIVATEd.

<P><LI>There are at most three READs active: the foundation READ, one of the
   application READs, and a READ MODAL associated with either 'browser' or
<PRE>   'finder'.

</PRE><P><LI>The procedure named 'efface', which is called in the cleanup code for
   each application screen, ensures that when the last application window
   is closed the control panel is released.

<P><LI>The application READ has been terminated because its DEACTIVATE clause
   has returned .T. but the foundation READ remains active.

<P><LI>The foundation READ is still active.

<P><LI>The first application's DEACTIVATE clause returns .T. and, thereby,
   terminates that application READ. Termination of the application READ
   triggers the foundation READ's VALID clause. This routine, called
<PRE>   'myhandler', notes that WONTOP() is a new application READ then proceeds
   to execute the .SPR associated with that window.
