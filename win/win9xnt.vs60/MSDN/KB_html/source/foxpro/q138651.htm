The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When the Setup Wizard is run for the first time, the "Visual FoxPro Runtime
3.0" check box appears unselected in the Step 2 - Optional Components
screen. Select this check box to compress the Vfp300.esl library file that
is needed to run a Visual FoxPro application .exe file on another computer.
After you select the "Visual FoxPro Runtime 3.0" check box the first time,
it will be selected by default the next time the Setup Wizard is run. The
Vfp300.esl library file is 3,713,213 bytes in size, so you may not want to
compress it every time the Setup Wizard is run.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
After starting the Setup Wizard to build the disks, you can, in Step 2 -
Optional Components, clear the "Visual FoxPro Runtime 3.0" check box. This
will allow the Setup Wizard to build the disks much more quickly due to not
having to compress the Vfp300.esl library file. Also, there will be fewer
disks created due to the absence of the Vfp300.esl library file. If the
user has already installed the disks created with the Vfp300.esl library
file earlier, the file is already on the computer in the \Windows\System
subdirectory. An .exe file built in Visual FoxPro automatically looks in
the \Windows\System subdirectory for the Vfp300.esl library file.
Therefore, when you send a user an update of your application or a second
application, you don't need to include the Vfp300.esl library file again.
All Visual FoxPro .exe files located on a computer can use the same
Vfp300.esl library file as long as it is placed in the Windows\System
subdirectory.
