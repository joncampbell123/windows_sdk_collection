The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, versions 2.5b, 2.5c, and 2.6a
<LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The following information describes differences and similarities in path
constructs between the Macintosh and MS-DOS platforms and explains how to
use path constructs in FoxPro.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The rules for naming drives differ on the Macintosh and MS-DOS platforms.
The drive name on the MS-DOS platform consists of a single character
followed by a colon such as C: or D:. On the Macintosh, a drive name may
look like "Mac HD:" or "Barney:" (without the quotation marks). The
Macintosh drive name can even contain a space between multiple letters
whereas the MS-DOS style is limited to one character. Both, however, end
with a colon.
<P>
NOTE: Volume names, paths, and file names are not case sensitive. The term
"volume" is interchangable with "drive" on the Macintosh platform.
<P>
<P><h3>File Names</h3>
 
<P>
Valid characters in file names are:
<P>
<PRE>   A-Z, underscore, and 0-9 but do not begin a file name with a numeral.

</PRE>Invalid characters according to the Finder are:
<P>
<PRE>   Colon (:) - ASCII value 58
   Some systems substitute a dash -

</PRE>Invalid characters according to FoxPro's Fcreate command are:
<P>
<PRE>   Double Quotation mark (") - ASCII value 34
   Colon (:) - ASCII value 58
   Backslash (\) - ASCII value 92

</PRE>Valid but potentially problematic characters are:
<P>
<PRE>   Single Quotation mark (') - ASCII value 39
   Period (.) other than the one automatically appended - ASCII value 46
   Space ( ) - ASCII value 32

</PRE><h3>Path Strings</h3>
 
<P>
A path is a series of directory names or folders separated by a delimiter
character such as a colon (:), which is the Macintosh notation, or a
backslash (\), which is the the MS-DOS notation. The path may or may not
have a file name at the end or a drive name at the beginning.
<P>
NOTE: Most FoxPro for Macintosh commands accept the path in either MS-DOS
backslash (\) format or Macintosh colon (:) format regardless of
environment settings. However, commands and functions such as FxNewFolder()
from Foxtools, which interact directly with the System, require a path in
Macintosh shorthand notation. Please see SYS(2027) in FoxPro Help for more
information.
<P>
<P><h3>When to Use Quotation Marks</h3>
 
<P>
Surround the path and file name with quotation marks when any element of
the volume, path, or file name contains any spaces or characters other than
those suggested above. Surrounding a path with quotation marks may or may
not be necessary, but if they are extraneous, they will be ignored.
<P>
<P><h3>Path Examples</h3>
 
<P>
For the following examples, assume the following structure:
<P>
<PRE>Barney             &lt;-- A volume with same name as folder
   +-Fred1.dbf
   |
   +-Folder
      +-Fred2.dbf
      |
      +-SubFolder1
      |  +-Fred3.dbf
      |  |
      |  +-Barney  &lt;-- A folder with same name as volume
      |     +-Fred5.dbf
      |
      +-SubFolder2
         +-Fred4.dbf

</PRE>Fully qualified paths to open the file FRED5.DBF:
<P>
<PRE>   USE Barney:Folder:SubFolder1:Barney:Fred5
   USE Barney:\Folder\SubFolder1\Barney\Fred5

   * incorrect
   USE Barney\Folder\SubFolder1\Barney\Fred5

</PRE>From root of the default volume to FRED3.DBF:
<P>
<PRE>   USE \Folder\SubFolder1\Fred3
   USE \:Folder:SubFolder1:Fred3

</PRE>NOTE: The critical difference between a relative path and a fully qualified
path to FRED5.DBF is the colon after but not before the volume name.
<P>
<P><h3>More Information on Relative Path Rules</h3>
 
<P>
Given that the default folder is SubFolder1 specified by this command:
<P>
<PRE>   Default=Barney:Folder:SubFolder1

</PRE>Two valid commands for opening the table in FoxPro are:
<P>
<PRE>   USE Fred3

   This assumes MS-DOS shorthand that does not require a preceding path
   separator for references relative to the current directory.

   USE :Fred3

   This Macintosh shorthand does require a preceding path separator for
   references relative to the current directory.

</PRE>Valid references to the child folder of current folder to FRED5.DBF are:
<P>
<PRE>   USE :Barney:Fred5
   USE Barney\Fred5

</PRE>Valid references to the parent folder and FRED2.DBF are:
<P>
<PRE>   USE ..\Fred2
   USE ::Fred2

</PRE>Valid references to the grandparent folder and FRED1.DBF are:
<P>
<PRE>   USE ..\..\Fred1
   USE :::Fred1

</PRE>Valid references to the sibling folder and FRED4.DBF are:
<P>
<PRE>   USE ..\SubFolder2\Fred4
   USE ::SubFolder2:Fred4
</PRE>
