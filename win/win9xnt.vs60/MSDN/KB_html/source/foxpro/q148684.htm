<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
After a normal installation process, attempts to start the FoxPro for the
Macintosh Help file fail. Often, the rest of the software functions
normally. This article offers some troubleshooting tips to solve this
problem.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
After installing FoxPro for the Macintosh, you find that you can't open the
Help file by any method from within FoxPro. Typing HELP in the Command
window or pressing the F1 key fail to start Help. Often, attempts to start
graphical Help do not produce any errors; the Help file simply refuses to
open.
<P>
Many times this problem may manifest itself on a single computer. Other
computers that have FoxPro installed from the same disk may function
correctly.
<P>
Because this problem frequently does not produce an error message, it can
be particularly difficult to troubleshoot.
<P>
The role of the FoxPro Help engine described in this article in assigned to
a file named Microsoft Visual FoxPro Help, located in the Microsoft folder.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps That May Enable the FoxPro Help File</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Open the Finder in Macintosh, and click the File pad. Choose the Find
   option, and type FoxHelp.hlp to locate the file. Double-click the file
   and see if the Help file opens. If it doesn't, there's a problem with
   the .hlp file. Run the uninstall from the Microsoft FoxPro setup folder,
   and remove the Help files. Then reinstall the help files after
   performing steps 2 and 3. If Help does start, proceed to step 2.

<P><LI>Turn off FoxPro, and rebuild the Macintosh desktop by holding the
   OPTION and APPLE keys down while choosing Restart from the Special menu
   pad. Start FoxPro and try to invoke Help.

<P><LI>Turn off FoxPro, and boot the computer without extensions by holding
   down the SHIFT key while choosing Restart from the Special menu pad.
   Start FoxPro and try to invoke Help.

<P><LI>Quit FoxPro, turn off Apple Talk, and restart FoxPro.

<P><LI>Quit FoxPro, and move the FoxPro Help Engine file to the same folder as
   the FoxHelp.hlp file. The FoxPro Help Engine usually resides in the
   Microsoft folder. Start FoxPro, and use the SET HELP TO command to point
   to the location of the FoxHelp.hlp file.

<P><LI>Quit FoxPro, and restart the computer without extensions. Open the Setup
   folder in the Microsoft FoxPro folder. Double-click the Microsoft
   FoxPro Setup icon, and choose the Add/Remove button. Remove the
   Graphical Help option, and then reinstall it. This will require the
   FoxPro Macintosh installation disks.
<P>
</OL>If all of these steps fail to enable Help, create an alias for the Help
file, and invoke it from the icon, provided that double-clicking the
FoxHelp.hlp in Finder works.
