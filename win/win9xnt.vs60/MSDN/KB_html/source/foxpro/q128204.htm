The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.6, 2.6a
<LI>Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS, versions 2.6, 2.6a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Using the Safety check box in Catalog Manager does not restrict the alert
messages in program files.
<P>
Within Catalog Manager, if you select the Tools menu pad and then the
Settings... option, the Catalog Manager Settings dialog box appears. Within
this dialog box is the check box in question (Safety). If Safety is
checked, this is the same as SET SAFETY ON in the FoxPro Language
Reference.
<P>
By default, it is always checked unless it has been manually unchecked at
some earlier time. When this check box is checked, however, it does not
behave as does the SET SAFETY ON command line, as expected.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Use the SET SAFETY OFF command line when neccessary in program files.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Verify the Safety check box is checked.

<P><LI>From Catalog Manager's main screen, select the Program tab.

<P><LI>Click the New button. From the Create Program dialog box, click
   the New Program button.

<P><LI>In the Save As dialog box, save this new program as MYSAFETY.PRG.

<P><LI>When the MYSAFETY.PRG editing window appears, enter the following
   lines of code:
<P>
   USE customer
   INDEX ON cno TAG cno
   SET ORDER TO TAG cno
   BROWSE

<P><LI>Press CTRL+W to save the program. Click the Run button to execute it.

<P><LI>After running the code for the first time, immediately run it
   again and the following alert message appear:
<P>
   cno already exists, overwrite it?

<P><LI>Click the Modify button.

<P><LI>When the edit window for MYSAFETY.PRG appears, enter the following
   command line as the very first line of the code:
<P>
   SET SAFETY OFF

<P><LI>Run the program again. The alert message no longer appears. This is the
<P><PRE>    behavior that is expected when the Safety check box has been checked.
