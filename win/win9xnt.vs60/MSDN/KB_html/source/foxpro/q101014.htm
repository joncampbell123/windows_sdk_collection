<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Running a Setup program written by the SetupWizard generates two error
messages, although the Setup program reports completion. The error
messages are:
<P>
<PRE>   File copy operation failed - incorrect number of
   bytes written to disk - source file or destination
   disk may be corrupted - use ChkDsk

   -and-

   Error decompressing &lt;filename&gt;

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The file reported in the error message has been compressed incorrectly,
split incorrectly, or the compressing or splitting process was interrupted.
These errors can be caused by a low-memory (below 640K) situation, too
little free disk space, and/or interruption during compression.
<P>
This problem may also be caused by using the default DKSETUP.INI SplitSize
setting.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
In the directory where the disk images were created, there should be a
COMPRESS subdirectory. Delete all the files in this directory, or free up
additional disk space, then run the SetupWizard again.
<P>
If freeing up additional disk space doesn't correct the problem, increase
the SplitSize value in the DKSETUP.INI file from the default of 363520 to
524288.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The COMPRESS subdirectory contains all the files that were compressed,
split, or both during the previous run of the SetupWizard. If a file
that is distributed needs to be compressed or split and it has not
changed from the last time the SetupWizard was run, the file is not
compressed or split; instead the images created from the previous run
of the SetupWizard are used.
