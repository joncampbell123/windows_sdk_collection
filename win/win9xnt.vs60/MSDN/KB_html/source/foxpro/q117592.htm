<P>
<P>
 
Part 1: Installation
 
<P>
<P><h3>Installing the Professional Edition of FoxPro Version 2.6</h3>
 
The Professional Edition of FoxPro version 2.6 includes the following kits:
<P>
Distribution Kit
Connectivity Kit
Library Construction Kit
WorkGroup Extensions (FoxPro for Windows only)
<P>
To install the Professional Edition of FoxPro, first install the main
FoxPro product, then follow the installation instructions included
with each individual kit. The order in which the kits are installed
does not matter.
 
<P>
FoxPro version 2.6 now includes the FoxPro Wizards, located in the
WIZARDS subdirectory. The FoxPro Wizards and CATALOG.APP should not
be distributed with your applications.
 
<P>
 
Part 2: Knowledge Base Articles
 
<P>
If you installed the Knowledge Base articles, you can view them by
running the application KBVIEW.APP.  These articles contain useful
information about a variety of FoxPro topics.
 
<P>
 
Part 3: The Help Compiler and Microsoft Word for Windows
 
<P>
The Help Compiler version 3.10.504 shipped with the Distribution Kit,
does not support Word for Windows version 6.0 RTF files.  You can
obtain a version of the Help Compiler that supports Word for Windows
<P><h3>version 6.0 RTF through the Microsoft Developer's Network.</h3>
 
<P>
 
Part 4: Changes to Distribution Kit User's Guide Since Printing
 
<P>
In the Distribution Kit User's Guide, references to FoxPro version 2.5
should be read as references to FoxPro version 2.6.
 
<P>
In the documentation, the FoxPro for Windows Distribution Kit support
file is called FOXW2500.ESL. The support file name should be
FOXW2600.ESL.
 
<P>
Chapter 1, page 5: Installation
<P>
This section incorrectly states that FOXW2500.ESL (FOXW2600.ESL) and
DKREADME.TXT are installed in the Distribution Kit directory. These
files are actually installed in your FoxPro for Windows directory.
 
<P>
Chapter 2, page 12: Including FoxPro for MS-DOS Printer Drivers
<P>
You should also include DRIVER2.FLL as a file if your application
requires FoxPro for MS-DOS printer drivers.
 
<P>
Chapter 2, page 13: Modifying the Main FoxPro Window TITLE, a new
FoxPro for Windows configuration file (CONFIG.FPW) item, was not
documented in this section.
<P>
If you select Close from your application's Control Menu or Exit from
the File menu, a message containing the text in your application's
title bar is displayed.
<P>
Include the TITLE configuration item to specify the message displayed
when you select either of these two options. The title bar text is
overridden by the text you specify with the TITLE configuration item.
<P>
For example, the message "Exit MyApp" is displayed when the following
line is place in CONFIG.FPW: TITLE = MyApp
 
<P>
Chapter 3, page 17: Adding an Icon to your .EXE File
<P>
The warning states that you cannot use the Program Item Properties
dialog in the Windows Program Manager to add or change the icon for
an .EXE file created with the FoxPro for Windows Distribution Kit.
This is not correct. You can use the Program Item Properties dialog in
the Windows Program Manager to manipulate the icon for a .EXE created
with the Distribution Kit.
 
<P>

<P>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Questions and Answers</h3>
 
<P>
Question 1
<P>
Where does my application's executable (.EXE) file look for FOXW2600.ESL?
<P>
Answer 1
<P>
The executable file looks for FOXW2600.ESL, the FoxPro for Windows
Support Library, in the following locations in this order:

<OL><P><LI> In the directory from which the .EXE is run.

<P><LI> In the current working directory.

<P><LI> Along the MS-DOS path.
</OL> 
<P>
Question 2
<P>
If my application uses the RUN command to execute external MS-DOS
programs, where should I put FOXRUN.PIF?
<P>
Answer 2
<P>
Place FOXRUN.PIF in the same directory as the FOXW2500.ESL file. This
is usually the root directory of the directory structure containing
the files you want on your distribution diskettes.
 
<P>
Question 3
<P>
How do I pass parameters to my application's executable file (.EXE)?
<P>
Answer 3
<P>
The first line of your application's main program must be a
PARAMETERS statement to accept the parameters you pass. For example,
the following PARAMETERS statement can be used to accept two
parameters:
<P>
PARAMETERS mparam1, mparam2
<P>
You can specify the parameters that are passed to your application's
.EXE file when you use the SetupWizard to create your setup routine.
Specify the parameters in the screen where the SetupWizard asks you
for the name
of your application. If you specify more than one parameter, separate
the parameters with a space. If a parameter contains an embedded
space, place double quotation marks (" ") around the parameter.
<P>
You can also specify parameters to pass to the application's .EXE
file by selecting the application's icon and choosing Properties...
from the Program Manager File menu. Enter the parameters to pass to
the .EXE file
in the Command Line text box.
 
<P>
Question 4
<P>
My application uses FoxFont. Where do I put the FoxFont file FOXFONT.FON?
<P>
Answer 4
<P>
Place FOXFONT.FON in the same directory as the FOXW2600.ESL file.
This is usually the root directory of the directory structure
containing the files you want on your distribution disks.
 
<P>
Question 5
<P>
Our organization includes several FoxPro developers. Does each
developer need an individual copy of the Distribution Kit?
<P>
Answer 5
<P>
Your organization must own one licensed copy of the Distribution Kit
per developer, for each developer creating applications for
distribution. If five developers in your organization create
applications for istribution, you must own five licensed copies of the
Distribution Kit.
 
<P>
Question 6
<P>
What type of applications (single or multiuser) can be built with
the Distribution Kit?
<P>
Answer 6
<P>
You can build all types of applications (single and multiuser)
with the FoxPro version 2.6 for Windows Distribution Kit. While the FoxPro
version 2.0 Distribution Kit required separate license agreements for
single user, multiuser, and so on, the development version of FoxPro
version 2.6 no longer makes these distinctions. However, as mentioned in
the previous answer, in order to be legally correct, you must own one
licensed copy of the FoxPro version 2.6 for Windows Distribution Kit for
each developer creating FoxPro version 2.6 applications for distribution.
 
<P>
Question 7
<P>
I have a question regarding the legal requirements for reselling
applications developed with FoxPro. Let's say that, as a FoxPro
developer, I write a program for Client A. I compile the program as a
compact .EXE file and give the application to Client A, together with
the FOXW2600.ESL support library file with which to run the
application. Client A owns the application and the copyright. Client
A then sells the application commercially to many other people.
<P>
A) Does Client A also have to purchase the FoxPro Distribution Kit,
<PRE>   even though Client A will never use the Distribution Kit themselves?

</PRE></OL>B) Does Client A have to purchase the FoxPro version 2.6 development
version?
<P>
Answer 7
<P>
A) No, Client A does not need to purchase the Distribution Kit. Only
<PRE>   the developer who uses the Distribution Kit to build the original
   .EXE file must own a licensed copy of the Distribution Kit.

</PRE>B) Client A does not have to purchase FoxPro version 2.6, because the
<PRE>   client is not building their own .EXE file; Client A is just a reseller.
   Client A must distribute the application in its original form, however,
   and cannot remove the runtime files to include it with another
   application.
</PRE> 
<P>
Question 8
<P>
Should I distribute FOXPRO.INT with my application?
<P>
Answer 8
<P>
We recommend that you include FOXPRO.INT, the FoxPro international
file that provides additional collation sequence and code page
support, with your distributed application. You must include
FOXPRO.INT with your application if it uses a collation sequence
other than MACHINE or is run on multiple FoxPro platforms.
<P>
Place FOXPRO.INT in the root directory of the directory structure
containing the files you want on your distribution disks.
