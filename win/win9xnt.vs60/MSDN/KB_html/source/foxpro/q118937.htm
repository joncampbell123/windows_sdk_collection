The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, versions 2.5b, 2.5c
<LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After FoxPro files have been converted from MS-DOS format to the Macintosh
format, they do not display the correct FoxPro icons or file kind in a
window. Additionally, viewing the files with a resource editor, such as
ResEdit, shows that they have the wrong resource type and creator.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Because MS-DOS files do not have resources, the tool used to transport them
to the Macintosh usually assigns its creator and file type to the files.
Examples are the Apple File Exchange utility and networks that support
connections to MS-DOS-based machines and Macintoshes, such as Microsoft
Windows NT.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To fix the files, do one of the following:

<UL><LI>If only a few files are involved, use one of the techniques described in
   the "More Information" section below to change the creator and file
   types of the files.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>If many files are involved, you may want to use the programmatic
   workaround described in the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
   Base:
<P>
<P><PRE>       ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../foxpro/q114999.htm">Q114999</A></B>
<PRE></PRE>       TITLE     : PRB: Creators and Types Are Reset After Transport
                   to Macintosh

</PRE></UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Change File Creator and Types by Using File, Save As</h3>
 
<P>
NOTE: This technique does not work on file types, such as tables, that
can't be saved using the Save As command on the File menu.

<OL><P><LI>From the File menu, choose Open. Select the appropriate file type in the
   Type list box.

<P><LI>Select the file you want to change, and then choose Open.
<P>
   NOTE: If the file isn't visible, select the All Files check box.

<P><LI>If prompted to transport the file, choose Transport.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Save As. Keep the current filename and choose
   Save.

<P><LI>When prompted to replace the existing file, choose Save.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Close.
<P>
</OL><h3>Steps to Change File Creator and Types Using ResEdit</h3>
 
<P>
CAUTION: This workaround uses Apple's resource editor, ResEdit. Because a
file may be damaged if incorrect changes are made, the use of ResEdit is
recommended for advanced Macintosh users only. As a precautionary step, you
may want to make backup copies of the FoxPro files before proceeding.
<P>
NOTE: The instructions below are for ResEdit version 2.1.1. If you use a
different version of ResEdit, these instructions may vary slightly. ResEdit
does not come with the Macintosh operating system, but can be obtained from
Macintosh user groups or the Apple Programmers and Developers Association
(APDA).

<OL><P><LI>Start ResEdit. Press ESC to stop the animated opening screen.

<P><LI>In the opening dialog box, choose Cancel.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Get File/Folder Info.

<P><LI>Select the file that needs its creator and type changed. Choose
   Get Info.

<P><LI>Change the type to the appropriate type. Change the Creator to
   FOXX.
<P>
   NOTE: For a list of FoxPro types, see the "Creator File Types"
   topic in the FoxPro online Help system.

<P><LI>Close the window for the selected file. When prompted to "save info,"
   choose Yes.

<P><LI>If you need to change other files, repeat steps 3-6 for each file.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Quit.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: If the file kind/type and icon do not change, you will need to
rebuild the desktop. To do this, perform the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>While holding down the COMMAND and OPTION keys, choose Restart from the
   Special menu. Continue holding down the COMMAND and OPTION keys while
   the Macintosh restarts--this rebuilds the desktop.

<P><LI>After the Macintosh restarts, it displays the following dialog box:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Are you sure you want to rebuild the
      desktop file on the disk "&lt;disk_name&gt;"?
      Comments in info windows will be lost.
</PRE><P>
   Release the COMMAND and OPTION keys, and then choose OK.
