The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, version 2.6a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you open a report or screen for editing and that report or screen was
created on a platform other than the current one, the Transport program is
invoked to add platform specific records to .SCX and .FRX files. Once the
platform-specific records have been created and the file modified, there is
no intrinsic method to revert back to the original (untransported) form.
This article shows by example how to do it using code.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
IMPORTANT NOTE: The techniques described below will *PERMANENTLY* remove
all work done under the current platform on the file selected. This measure
should only be carried out if attempting to repair the work would be
costlier in time and effort than starting over again.
<P>
Returning the file to a pre-transported state can be accomplished by
opening the .SCX or .FRX with the USE command and deleting the records for
the specific platform. However, if there are more than a few files to
revert, this method can be time-consuming and cumbersome.
<P>
The following program will quickly modify the selected files, while
allowing control over the name and type of files selected. If the file has
no platform specific records, the system message window will show that the
selected file has completed processing, with no error generated.
<P>
To display an optional safety message prior to packing the database, remove
the asterisks placed in front of the section of code.
