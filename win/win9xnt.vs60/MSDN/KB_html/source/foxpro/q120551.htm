Part 1: Distribution Kit Information
 
This section includes information about:
<P>
-   Installing the Distribution Kit on a Network
-   Distribution Kit Files
-   Using the Distribution Kit with FoxPro
-   Distributed Applications on a Network
<P>
 
Installing the Distribution Kit on a Network
<P>
If you use Network Install #2 to install the Distribution Kit to a
network location that contains FoxPro, you will be prompted to replace
some files. These files are common to FoxPro and the Distribution Kit,
and differ only in their timestamps. Since the files are otherwise
identical, you can choose to replace the files, or continue to use
your existing copies.
<P>
 
Distribution Kit Files
<P>
The Distribution Kit includes the following library files:
<P>
-Macintosh:
<PRE>  FOXMAC26.ESL
  FOXMAC.LIB

</PRE>-Power Macintosh:
<PRE>  FOXPPC26.ESL
  FOXPPC.LIB

</PRE>When you are building an application for distribution, you need these
files to create the executables, but you do not need to distribute
these files with your application.
<P>
 
Using the Distribution Kit with FoxPro
<P>
If any Distribution Kit applications or libraries are accessible on
any mounted drive, double-clicking a FoxPro file opens the
Distribution Kit libraries or applications instead. This is due to the
later timestamp on the Distribution Kit libraries. To use FoxPro and
the Distribution Kit together, you must do one of the following:

<UL><LI>Launch FoxPro using the Microsoft FoxPro icon, then use Open from
   the File menu to open FoxPro files.
<LI>Unmount the drive that contains the Distribution Kit, while working
   with FoxPro.
<LI>Modify the FoxPro timestamp to be later than the Distribution Kit
   file timestamp.
<LI>Modify the timestamp on the Distribution Kit libraries or
   application to be earlier than FoxPro's timestamp.
<P>
</UL> 
Distributed Applications on a Network
<P>
When two machines try to run the same distributed application over a
network, the second machine receives a message, "Application in use."
To prevent this message, you must do one of the following:

<UL><LI>Lock the distributed application.
<LI>Checked the Shared bit on the application.
<LI>Place the application on a read-only share.
<P>
</UL>Any of these choices ensures that your executable or application can
be accessed over a network.
<P>
 
Part 2: Changes to Documentation Since Printing
 
Page 22
Add the following note to "Creating an Application Folder."
<P>
**Note**
The names for your application folder and files must have:

<UL><LI>No more than 27 characters
<LI>No special characters such as commas (,) or ellipsis (...)
<P>
</UL>In addition, application folder names cannot contain spaces.
<P>
 
Page 22
Add the following note to "Creating an Application Folder."
<P>
**Note**
If your application includes a graphical Help file, you can also
distribute the Microsoft Help engine. Add the following files to your
application folder:
<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft Help
   FoxPro Help Engine

</PRE>Note that you can distribute only the Help engine files, not the
FoxPro graphical or .DBF-style Help files themselves.
<P>
