<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, version 2.6
<LI>Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS, version 2.6
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The information below describes the Updatable Query Wizard and how to use
it to create an updatable query.
<P>
This information is also found in FoxPro online Help in the "Updatable
Query Wizard" topic.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Updatable Query Wizard searches one or more tables for records that
match the criteria you specify. It creates an updatable query file with an
.FPQ extension. When you run your query, you create a set of data which you
can edit; changes you make to the records in the query results will be
reflected in the tables the query is based upon.
<P>
<P><h3>UPDATABLE QUERY WIZARD STEPS</h3>
 
<P>
The Updatable Query Wizard has five main steps:

<OL><P><LI>Selecting and relating tables

<P><LI>Selecting fields and adding expressions

<P><LI>Setting the sort order of records (optional)

<P><LI>Limiting or filtering the records retrieved (optional)

<P><LI>Viewing, saving, and browsing the query, or creating an AutoReport
   from it
<P>
</OL>Detailed instructions for each step are provided below.
<P>
<P><h3>Step 1 of 5: Selecting Tables</h3>
 
<P>
First, select the table or tables you want to use from the Available Tables
list.
<P>
NOTE: If you are using the Query Wizard from the Catalog Manager, the
tables on which you want to base your query must reside in the open
catalog. If there are no tables found in the catalog and you click the
Query Wizard button, you will be prompted to name your query and select a
table on which to base the query. Next, RQBE will start from which you can
create a query. If you are not using the Wizard from the Catalog Manager,
you can also choose the Open Table... button to use a table that is not
currently open.
<P>
<P><h3>Step 1a of 5: Relating Tables</h3>
 
<P>
When you have more than one table selected, the wizard displays this screen
so you can relate the tables. Select matching fields from the parent table
and the child table, then choose Add.
<P>
For example, if you are setting a relationship between the Customer table
and the Invoices table, you could set Customer.cno equal to Invoices.cno.
<P>
The Outer Join check box affects which records will be included in the
output of your query. When the box is checked, all the parent table records
are included, even if they do not have a matching record in the child
table. When the box is not checked, your query will only contain records
from the parent table if matches are found in the child table.
<P>
If you want to delete the relationship between two tables, select the
relationship and choose the Remove button.
<P>
When you are done relating tables, choose Next to continue to the next
step.
<P>
<P><h3>Step 2 of 5: Selecting Fields and Adding Expressions</h3>
 
<P>
Select the fields you want to include in the query. The list of available
fields includes fields from all the tables you have selected.
<P>
To select fields, you can:

<UL><LI>Double-click each field name in the Available Fields list.

<LI>Select each field name and choose the Add button.

<LI>Choose the Add All button to use all the table fields.
<P>
</UL>If you add a field you don't need, select it and choose the Remove button.
<P>
Adding Expressions to your Query:
<P>
You can also add expressions to your query. An expression is a combination
of operators, functions, and field names that evaluate to a single value.
<P>
NOTE: You cannot use aggregate functions (such as AVG, COUNT, MAX, MIN, or
SUM) in your query.
<P>
When you choose the Expression... button, the wizard displays the
Expression dialog, where you can create the expression to add to your
query.
<P>
To Create an Expression with the Expression Dialog:

<OL><P><LI>Enter a name for your expression in the Name of calculated field box.

<P><LI>Either type the expression directly into the Expression box, or select
   String, Math, or Date expressions and combine them with the Fields
   available.

<P><LI>When you've finished building the expression, choose OK to confirm it.
<P>
</OL>If you need to modify an expression after you have created it, select it in
the Selected Fields list, and choose the Expression... button again.
<P>
<P><h3>Step 3 of 5: Setting the Sort Order for the Records</h3>
 
<P>
In this screen, you determine how the records retrieved by the query will
be sorted.
<P>
Select up to three fields from the Available Fields list to set the sort
order of the records. Only fields from the parent table are available for
sorting.
<P>
For example, if you choose Customer.Lastname and Customer.Ino, the records
will be sorted by customer name and then by customer invoice number.
<P>
Choose the Ascending option to sort records from the beginning of the
alphabet, the lowest number, or the earliest date; choose the Descending
option to sort records from the end of the alphabet, the highest number, or
the latest date.
<P>
<P><h3>Step 4 of 5: Limiting the Contents of the Query</h3>
 
<P>
In this screen you can add an optional expression to further limit the
records retrieved by the query. The effect is like filtering the results so
that only records meeting certain criteria are included in the query
results. For example, you could limit the search to last names starting
with J by using the expression:
<P>
<PRE>   Customer.lastname BeginsWith J

</PRE></OL>First select a field from the Fields list and an operator from the Operator
list. Then enter a comparison value in the Value field, and choose the Add
button to add the new expression to the expression box.
<P>
Entering Values:
<P>
In the Value field, type the value you want the query to compare the field
against. For example, if you are looking for customer records with a
particular last name, type that name in the Value box, after choosing the
last name field and the equal-sign operator. The resulting query expression
would look like this:
<P>
<PRE>   LAST_NAME = JOHNSON

</PRE>Combining Expressions:
<P>
You can create more complex queries by adding more expressions.
<P>
When you combine expressions, they are combined with an AND operator by
default. For example:
<P>
<PRE>   STATE = WA
   AND ORDER &gt; $100

</PRE>If you want the query to find records that match either expression, but not
both, choose the OR button to add an OR operator between expressions. For
example:
<P>
<PRE>   STATE = WA
   OR
   STATE = CA

</PRE>You can add parentheses around an expression to make sure the expressions
are evaluated as a unit. For example:
<P>
<PRE>   (STATE=WA
   OR
   STATE=CA)
   AND
   ORDER &gt; $100

</PRE>To Create an Expression:

<OL><P><LI>Select a field from the Fields list.

<P><LI>Select an operator from the Operator list.

<P><LI>Enter one or more values for comparison in the Value box.

<P><LI>Choose the Add button to add the resulting expression line to the
   expression box.

<P><LI>To check the results of the filter expression on the query, choose
   the Preview button.
<P>
</OL>To Remove an Expression:

<UL><LI>Select the expression line and choose the Remove button.
<P>
</UL><h3>Step 5 of 5: Previewing, Saving, and Browsing Your Query</h3>
 
<P>
Choose the Preview... button to see the results of your query in a Browse
window. If you are satisfied with the results, choose one of the following
options, and choose the Finish button.

<UL><LI>Save Query For Later Use creates an Updatable query file with an
   .FPQ extension.

<LI>Save And Run Query saves the query and displays the records in a
   Browse window, so you can view and update them.

<LI>Save And Create An AutoReport saves the query and creates and runs
   an automatic report based on the fields in the query.
