The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, version 2.6
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The Group/Total Wizard does not have a screen titled "6 of 7." It goes from
a screen titled "5 of 7" to a screen titled "7 of 7."
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The report does not contain any numeric fields that are not used in a group
header.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Screen 6 of 7 prompts you with the question "Do you want totals, subtotals,
or both?" You can choose the Totals and/or Subtotals check boxes to include
totals and/or subtotals for each numeric field (that isn't in a group
header) within each group defined.
<P>
Although this behavior can also be reproduced in FoxPro for MS-DOS, wizard
screens in FoxPro for MS-DOS don't contain a title bar displaying the
screen number. This makes it less apparent that a screen has been skipped.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>In the Command window, type "CLOSE ALL" (without the quotation marks).

<P><LI>From the Run menu, choose Wizard, and then choose Report.

<P><LI>When prompted, select Group/Total Report Wizard. Choose Next.

<P><LI>When prompted to select a table, choose Open.

<P><LI>Select INVOICES.DBF, located in the &lt;FoxPro_directory&gt;\TUTORIAL
   subdirectory. Choose Open, and then choose Next.

<P><LI>When prompted to select a style, choose Next.

<P><LI>When prompted for the fields to include, select INO (numeric), CNO
   character), and IDATE (date) from the Available Fields list box, and add
   them to the Selected Fields list box. Choose Next.

<P><LI>When prompted to select the fields to sort and group by, select INO and
   from the Available Fields list box and add it to the Group Levels list
   box. Choose Next.
<P>
   Note that the next screen displayed is titled "Group/Total Report Wizard
   - Step 5 of 7."

<P><LI>Choose Next.
<P>
</OL>Note that the next screen displayed is titled, "Group/Total Report Wizard -
Step 7 of 7."
<P>
NOTE: To see the screen titled "Group/Total Report Wizard - Step 6 of 7,"
repeat the steps above, but select CNO, which is a character field, instead
of INO, which is a numeric field, in step 8.
