<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS creates temporary files in the current working
directory unless the CONFIG.FP configuration file contains a TMPFILES
statement to specifically designate an alternate location for the files.
The syntax of the TMPFILES statement is as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   TMPFILES=&lt;drive:&gt;

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
FoxPro creates temporary files in the process of editing, indexing,
and sorting data, and for a critical internal file called the "program
cache." The TMPFILES entry in the CONFIG.FP specifies the drive on
which the EDITWORK, SORTWORK, and PROGWORK files are stored if none of
the other options specify locations for these files. Specifying
locations for these files can be useful to optimize performance in a
FoxPro/LAN environment.
<P>
Editor sessions can momentarily create a complete copy of the file
being edited on the TMPFILES drive (when it creates .BAK files).
Indexing and sorting operations for large databases can create large
files on the TMPFILES drive. Although the program cache is not
especially large, it is a critical file. Running out of disk space
while attempting to extend the program cache is a fatal error.
<P>
RAM disks are generally quite limited in size. It is usually not a
good idea to use one for the TMPFILES drive. Generally, try to ensure
that plenty of space is available on the TMPFILES drive.
<P>
There are two basic situations where it is useful to place the
TMPFILES directory somewhere other than the default location:

<OL><P><LI>If the system has two or more hard disks installed, additional
   indexing and sorting speed is available if the TMPFILES directory
   is set to a drive other than the drive on which most of the data
   resides. This benefit is due to the efficiency gained by having two
   independent, simultaneously active sets of disk access hardware.

<P><LI>If FoxPro is running from a network, additional speed is available
   if TMPFILES is assigned to a local hard drive.
