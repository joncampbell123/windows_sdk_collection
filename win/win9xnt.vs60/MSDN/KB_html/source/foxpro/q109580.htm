<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The following error messages can be produced by improper usage of the
SELECT statement:
<P>
<PRE>     SQL column &lt;field&gt; not found
     &lt;field&gt; is not a memory variable
     Alias &lt;alias&gt; not found

</PRE>The code sample below illustrates some possible causes of these error
messages and explains why they occur.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following code sample executes a variety of SELECT statements. If the
SELECT statement produces a error message, the reasoning behind the error
message is explained.
<P>
<PRE>   CREATE TABLE customer (company C(20),state C(2))
   INSERT INTO customer (company,state) VALUES ;
    ("ABC Company","WA")
   INSERT INTO customer (company,state) VALUES ;
    ("Main Street Store ","NY")

   CLOSE ALL

   USE customer ALIAS test

   SELECT customer.company FROM test WHERE customer.state = "WA"

    * Produces Error: SQL column 'COMPANY' not found
    * customer.company does not exist. The table is aliased as 'test'.
    * This should be: "test.company"
    * customer.state does not exist. The table is aliased as 'test'.
    * "customer.state" should be "test.state"

   SELECT customer.company FROM test WHERE test.state = "WA"

    * Produces Error: SQL column 'COMPANY' not found
    * customer.company does not exist. The table is aliased as 'test'.
    * "customer.company" should be "test.company"

   SELECT test.company FROM test WHERE customer.state = "WA"

    * Produces Error: 'STATE' is not a memory variable
    * customer.state does not exist. The table is aliased as 'test'.
    * "customer.state" should be "test.state"

   SELECT test.company FROM test WHERE test.state = "WA"

    * OK.  This is a valid SELECT statement.

   SELECT customer.company FROM customer WHERE customer.state = "WA"

    * Produces Error: SQL column 'COMPANY' not found
    * Since the customer table is already open, FoxPro will try
    * to use it. It won't go to disk to open the table. But
    * the table is aliased as 'test' so the fields should be
    * aliased as 'test'.
    * customer.company does not exist. The table is aliased as 'test'.
    * "customer.company" should be "test.company"

    * to use it. It won't go to disk to open the table. But

    * aliased as 'test'.

    * "customer.company" should be "test.company"
