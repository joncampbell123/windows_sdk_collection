The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS, versions 2.5 and 2.5a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Information on the Workstation Installation option (INSTALL /N) is not
located in the "Installation and Configuration" manual; instead it is in
the INSTALL.TXT file on the Setup disk (Disk 1). Below are the pertinent
excerpts from the INSTALL.TXT file.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Workstation Installation option (/N) copies FoxPro initialization
files to a local machine so that a shared network version of FoxPro
for MS-DOS can be run. Workstation Installation requires less space on
individual machines and allows greater administrative control of the
use of FoxPro. WORKSTATION INSTALLATION REQUIRES A PREVIOUS
ADMINISTRATIVE INSTALLATION.
<P>
**************************************************************
<PRE>* NOTE: Every Microsoft FoxPro user must have a Microsoft    *
* FoxPro license. A license is obtained by buying a retail   *
</PRE>* package or a Microsoft License Pack. For more information  *
* about network use restrictions, see your Microsoft FoxPro  *
<PRE>* license agreement.                                         *
</PRE>**************************************************************
<P>
<P><h2>WORKSTATION INSTALLATION (/N)</h2>
 

<OL><P><LI>Type X:\&lt;path&gt;\INSTALL /N at the MS-DOS prompt. X represents the
    network drive and &lt;path&gt; represents the directory in which FoxPro
    was installed with the Administrative Installation option.

<P><LI>The installation program suggests a directory in which to install
    FoxPro. To confirm installation of FoxPro in this directory, press
    ENTER. If this is not the desired directory to install FoxPro,
    type N and press ENTER. The installation program will prompt for
    an installation directory.

<P><LI>If the directory in which FoxPro will be installed is not in the
    path, the installation program asks whether or not to change the
    path in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file. Press ENTER to allow the
    modification, or type N and press ENTER if no modification is
    desired.

<P><LI>FOX.EXE is copied to the specified FoxPro directory. The
    installation program can be canceled by pressing ESCAPE at this
    point or press any other key to configure the FoxPro workstation.

<P><LI>An information screen explains FoxPro configuration and allows
    specification of which directory to place the configuration files
    in. The default is the specified FoxPro directory. Press ENTER to
    accept this default or type the preferred directory in the text
    box and press ENTER.

<P><LI>Choose &lt;&lt;Continue with configuration&gt;&gt; to proceed or &lt;Abort
    configuration procedure&gt; to cancel the configuration procedure.

<P><LI>A dialog opens so a directory can be specified to place the
    following files:
<P>
     - CONFIG.FP - FoxPro configuration file.
<P>
     - FOXUSER - A FoxPro database that keeps track of window sizes
       and so on.
<P>
     - Overlay files - Since the FoxPro executable file is too large
       to fit in conventional memory at one time, parts of it are kept
       in overlay files and loaded into memory as needed.
<P>
     - Editor work files - Temporary files created during editing
       sessions.
<P>
     - Sort work files - Temporary files used during database sorting
       and indexing.
<P>
     - Program work file - Temporary program file. Descriptions of
       these options are included in the dialog.
<P>
    By default, FoxPro uses all available expanded memory. In this
    dialog, an option is given to Limit the EMS Available to FoxPro.
    There are three push buttons at the bottom of the dialog: &lt;&lt;OK&gt;&gt; -
    Accept the directories and EMS settings. &lt;filer&gt; - Open the FoxPro
    Filer accessory to view the directories before deciding on
    configuration directory defaults. &lt;Cancel&gt; - Cancel the
    configuration procedure.

<P><LI>Options are given to have FoxPro update the AUTOEXEC.BAT file so
    that FoxPro looks for configuration information in the directories
    that have been previously specified.

<P><LI>The option to have configuration changes written to the CONFIG.FP
    file.

<P><LI>Installation is complete. Press any key to start FoxPro. Remember
    to reboot the machine so that changes made to the AUTOEXEC.BAT can
    take effect.
