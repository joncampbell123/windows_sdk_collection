The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS, versions 2.5x, 2.6x
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
FoxPro for MS-DOS does not provide printer support for the HP Laserjet 4
series of printers. However there is a third-party product that provides
this functionality.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
LJ4PD.EXE, a replacement for the original GENPD.APP distributed with FoxPro
for MS-DOS, is a third-party product written by Brad Schultz. This file
includes support for the Laserjet 4 printer.
<P>
The following information is excerpted from the README file included in
LJ4PD.EXE:
<P>
<PRE>   "This is an update to the GENPD project that ships with FoxPro 2.5.
   The GENPD project that I started with was the 2.5b version, which was
   the latest version released by Microsoft at the time I started this
   project (January 1994). My update will work just fine with Version 2.5
   or 2.5a, though."
