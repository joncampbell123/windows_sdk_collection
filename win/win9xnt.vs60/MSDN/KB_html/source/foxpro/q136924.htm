<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Visual FoxPro uses internal, hidden properties to accomplish some of its
tasks. The DoCreate, ErasePage, ReleaseErase, and ReleaseWindows properties
are not documented in the online Help. They are described in this article.
<P>
NOTE: These properties are undocumented, so they may be changed or omitted
without notice from future releases of Visual FoxPro. Their reliability is
not guaranteed.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Visual FoxPro uses tables to store data that defines different file types.
For example, Form files (.scx) and Visual Class Library files (.vcx) are
tables. Because these files are actually tables, you can use and browse
them in the same way that you browse any .dbf file.
<P>
In a Form or Visual Class Library file, the Properties field stores the
properties of objects in the Form or Visual Class Library. Some of the
properties listed are hidden and used internally only, so a description of
their functionality is not included in the documentation that comes with
Visual FoxPro. These properties are described in the following table:
<P>
<PRE>Property          Description
</PRE> 
<P>
<PRE>DoCreate          Hidden property of a form used for internal purposes
                  only. When DoCreate is encountered, form load
                  performance and memory utilization is optimized. If not
                  encountered, there is slightly more memory usage by the
                  form.

ErasePage         Used to support FoxPro 2.6 READ compatible forms. When
                  set to false (.F.), it specifies that objects remain
                  visible from other active READ levels.

ReleaseErase      Used to support FoxPro 2.6 READ compatible forms. It
                  determines whether a control remains on a form after a
                  READ terminates.

ReleaseWindows    Used to support FoxPro 2.6 READ compatible forms.
                  It specifies whether Release Windows was activated in the
                  FoxPro 2.6 Generate or Project Manager dialogs.
