<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article gives you tips that can be used with the Debug window to help
you debug forms.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>THIS and THISFORM Keywords</h3>
 
<P>
The THIS and THISFORM keywords can only be used in a class definition.
Because an object has been instantiated when a form is running, the THIS
and THISFORM keywords only reference the form object when a method is
executing. You can use the form's name to reference it in the Debug window.
A generic way to refer to the active form is to place the following
expression on the left side of the Debug window:
<P>
<PRE>   _SCREEN.ACTIVEFORM

</PRE>The "(object)" word that is presented on the right side of the Debug window
will signify that an object reference to the form exists.
<P>
<P><h3>How to Verify the Method Currently Executing</h3>
 
<P>
To verify the method currently executing, type PROGRAM() in the Debug
window. For example, if you have defined code for the Load event, the right
side of the Debug window will read FORM1.LOAD when the Load event is
executed.
<P>
<P><h3>How to Verify the Name of the Active Control in a Form</h3>
 
<P>
To verify the name of the active control in a form, type:
<P>
<PRE>     _SCREEN.ACTIVEFORM.ACTIVECONTROL.NAME

</PRE>This expression returns the name of the member object, such as Command1.
<P>
<P><h3>How to Verify the Name of the Container of an Active Control</h3>
 
<P>
To verify the name of the container of an active control, type:
<P>
<PRE>   _SCREEN.ACTIVEFORM.ACTIVECONTROL.PARENT.NAME

</PRE><h3>How to Suspend Execution of the Form</h3>
 
<P>
You can suspend execution of the form by setting a breakpoint in the Debug
window. For example, to verify the order in which methods are executed when
you run a form, you can place PROGRAM() on the left side of the Debug
window. This function is updated each time a method or the code associated
with an event is executed. If you set a breakpoint in the Debug window by
clicking the center bar, the execution of the form will be suspended each
time the value returned by PROGRAM() is modified.
