The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS, version 2.6
<LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, version 2.6
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The SET LIBRARY TO command has been changed in FoxPro version 2.6 to allow
greater compatibility with the dBASE IV version of this command. However,
the version 2.6 Help file incorrectly documents these changes.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The SET LIBRARY TO command has been changed to include the same
functionality as dBASE IV version 2.0. In previous versions of FoxPro, the
SET LIBRARY TO command was used only to load an API library compiled using
the Library Construction Kit (LCK). In version 2.6, the SET LIBRARY TO
command can also be used to specify a procedure file. The SET PROCEDURE
command remains unchanged and can still be used to specify a procedure
file.
<P>
If both a SET LIBRARY TO &lt;procedure file&gt; and a SET PROCEDURE TO &lt;procedure
file&gt; command are issued, both procedure files will be opened and the
procedures within both files will be available for use.
<P>
If no extension is provided for the library filename, for example, "SET
LIBRARY TO test", FoxPro will search for filenames in the following order:
<P>
<PRE>   .PLB or .FLL
   .APP
   .FXP
   .PRG

</PRE><h3>Documentation Errors</h3>
 
<P>
The Help file is incorrect or incomplete in some areas.

<UL><LI>The following note is incomplete:
<P>
   NOTE: The ability to open a procedure file with SET LIBRARY provides
   compatibility with dBASE IV. Using SET LIBRARY to open a procedure
   file will close all open API libraries; using SET LIBRARY to open API
   libraries will close a procedure file opened with SET LIBRARY. Use
   SET PROCEDURE to open a procedure file and prevent API libraries from
   being unloaded.
<P>
   If the SET LIBRARY TO command is used with the ADDITIVE clause, the
   procedure file will be opened, and the API library will remain loaded.

<LI>The following section of the Help file is incorrect:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ADDITIVE
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      To open additional API libraries, include ADDITIVE after the file
      name in successive SET LIBRARY commands. To remove all API libraries
      from memory, issue SET LIBRARY TO without including &lt;file name&gt; or
      ADDITIVE. To remove an individual library from memory, issue RELEASE
      LIBRARY &lt;library name&gt;. The ADDITIVE keyword is ignored when you use
      SET LIBRARY to open a procedure file.
</PRE><P>
   The ADDITIVE keyword is not ignored when SET LIBRARY is used to open a
   procedure file and an API library is loaded. If a procedure file has
   been loaded, the original procedure file will be closed and the new
   procedure file will be opened, regardless of whether ADDITIVE is
   included.
<P>
   To close a procedure file opened with the SET LIBRARY TO command, issue
   the SET LIBRARY TO command without including &lt;filename&gt; or ADDITIVE.
