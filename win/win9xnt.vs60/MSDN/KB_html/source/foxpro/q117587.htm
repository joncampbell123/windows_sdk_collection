The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, versions 2.5b, 2.5c
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Apple Events and dynamic data exchange (DDE) are analogous forms of high-
level interapplication communication (IAC) provided by System 7 on the
Macintosh and by Windows on the IBM-compatible PC, respectively.
<P>
Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh does not provide the same level of access to
IAC that its Windows counterpart achieves through DDE. While FoxPro for
Windows works with a fairly sophisticated set of DDE functions that you can
use to set up FoxPro for Windows as a client or a server application,
FoxPro for Macintosh works only with the required set of functions (RUN,
OPEN, PRINT, QUIT) in addition to DO SCRIPT, allowing you to execute
veritably any command in a script that you can execute interactively in the
FoxPro Command window.
<P>
However, a problem arises when you want to pass the result of one of these
commands from FoxPro for Macintosh to the client application requesting the
data. While the RUNSCRIPT command provides a means for returning a value to
FoxPro after an AppleScript script has finished performing an operation or
a calculation, the means of passing data to an application from FoxPro is
not as straightforward. Since no WITH clause is included with RUNSCRIPT,
you cannot simply pass parameters to a script that could then pass the data
contained in those parameters to another application. This article explains
two methods of passing data to an application that is requesting data from
FoxPro. The first method uses primitive file passing; the second uses the
Clipboard, also known as the "scrap."
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1</h3>
 
<P>
As stated above, the DO SCRIPT command allows you to execute virtually any
command that you can enter in the Command window. This functionality is
fine for performing basic maintenance on a table or for printing a routine
report or a set of labels where no result is needed in order to proceed.
Often, however, a decision is made based upon information derived from a
table. Using DO SCRIPT, you can perform a query to obtain information from
a table. However, you cannot directly return the result of the query to the
application requesting that the query be performed.
<P>
One method of circumventing this limitation is to use FoxPro's ability to
create ASCII files and in some cases files of the type specific to the
application that is requesting the data. The following code presents a
simple example of how you can take advantage of FoxPro's ability to store
and manage tabular data and Microsoft Excel's ability to analyze that data.

<OL><P><LI>In the Script Editor, type the following code. Replace the semicolons
   with the AppleScript command-continuation character (OPTION+ENTER):
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy "STATE" to theField
      copy "MA" to theValue
      copy "MASS" to destFile
      copy "Macintosh HD:Excel:" to destPath
      copy "Macintosh HD:FoxPro:tutorial:customer" to srcFile
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      tell application "Microsoft FoxPro"
<PRE></PRE>         Do Script "SET SAFETY OFF"
         copy "SELECT * FROM '" ;
            &amp; srcFile &amp; ;
            "' WHERE " ;
            &amp; theField &amp; ;
            "= '" &amp; theValue &amp; ;
            "' INTO CURSOR " ;
            &amp; destFile to cmd
         Do Script cmd

         copy "COPY TO '" ;
            &amp; destPath ;
            &amp; destFile ;
            &amp; ".XLS' TYPE XLS" to cmd
         Do Script cmd
         Do Script "SET SAFETY ON"
      end tell

      tell application "Microsoft Excel"
         copy destPath &amp; destFile &amp; ".XLS" to theDoc
         open theDoc
      end tell

</PRE><P><LI>In the FoxPro folder, save the script as an application called FilePass.
   Make sure you select the Never Show Startup Screen check box. Close the
   script.

<P><LI>Open Microsoft Excel version 4.0 for Macintosh and create a new macro
   sheet. In cells A1 through A3 of the macro sheet, type the following
   code:
<P>
<P><PRE>      FilePass
      =EXEC("MACINTOSH HD:FOXPRO:FILEPASS",,TRUE,TRUE)
      =RETURN()
</PRE>
<P><LI>Give the macro a name by clicking cell A1 of the macro sheet and
   choosing Define Name from the Formula menu. In the resulting dialog box,
   type a name such as "FilePass" and select the Command radio button in
   the Macro section of the dialog box. Choose OK to save the name and
   close the Define Name dialog box.

<P><LI>From the Macro menu, choose Run to run the macro. The result is a sheet
   in Microsoft Excel containing the 16 records from CUSTOMER.DBF that have
   addresses located in Massachusetts.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: You can incorporate the AppleScript copy commands that load the
script variables with the appropriate file locations into the cells of a
Microsoft Excel worksheet instead. Since Microsoft Excel supports a much
more sophisticated level of scripting than FoxPro, you can directly copy
the contents of Microsoft Excel worksheet cells into script variables. For
more information about Microsoft Excel's scripting capabilities, see the
Microsoft Excel Software Development Kit (SDK).
<P>
The advantage of the previous approach is that there is practically no
limit to the amount of data that can be passed from FoxPro to the
requesting application. The disadvantage is that FoxPro must write to a
disk file and that file must in turn be read, a much slower means of
communication than using RAM. On the Macintosh, the Clipboard is an area in
RAM that can be used to provide a faster, although limited, means of
passing data and requests between applications.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 2</h3>
 
<P>
Many Macintosh applications, including FoxPro for Macintosh, maintain their
own private scrap. FoxPro for Macintosh makes its private scrap available
to the user through the system memory variable _CLIPTEXT. When you are
switching from one application to another, the suspended application
transfers the contents of its private scrap to the system scrap. When an
application is resumed, it detects whether or not the contents of the
system scrap have changed, and, if necessary, transfers the contents of the
system scrap to its own private scrap. Activating one application, the
destination, implies that another application, the source, is suspended.
<P>
In the context of an AppleScript script and the Apple Events from which it
is derived, you must issue the "activate" command prior to accessing the
Clipboard in order to ensure that the previous application has transferred
the contents of its private scrap to the system scrap.
<P>
The following example shows that the system scrap, and hence the
destination application's scrap, will not be updated unless the destination
application is activated first. This example assumes that both FoxPro for
Macintosh and the Scriptable Text Editor, supplied with the AppleScript
extension, are available and that there is enough RAM available to run
FoxPro for Macintosh, the Scriptable Text Editor, and a small script
simultaneously.

<OL><P><LI>Type the following FoxPro code into a program file. Call it CPTEST.PRG.
<P>
<P><PRE>      _cliptext=' Jumped Over The Lazy Dog'
      RUNSCRIPT copyTest
</PRE>
<P><LI>Create an AppleScript containing the following code. Call it COPYTEST.
<P>
<P><PRE>      tell application "Scriptable Text Editor"
<PRE></PRE>         paste
      end tell

   NOTE: You must save and close the script before it can be used by FoxPro
   for Macintosh.

</PRE><P><LI>Launch the Scriptable Text Editor. In the document window that appears,
   type the following line of text:
<P>
<P><PRE>      The Quick Brown Fox...
</PRE>
<P><LI>Select the text and choose Copy from the Edit menu. Place the insertion
   point after the ellipsis in the document window and return to FoxPro.

<P><LI>Run the FoxPro program. When the program terminates, the focus should be
   returned to the FoxPro Command window. Switch to the Scriptable Text
   Editor to view the contents of the document window. It should contain
   the text "The Quick Brown Fox...".

<P><LI>Now that FoxPro for Macintosh has been suspended, its private scrap has
   been transferred to the system scrap which was, in turn, transferred to
   the private scrap of the Scriptable Text Editor. To demonstrate this,
   choose Paste from the Scriptable Text Editor's Edit menu. "Jumped Over
   The Lazy Dog" now appears in the document window.
<P>
</OL>To correct the sample AppleScript above so that the Scriptable Text Editor
document reflects the contents of the FoxPro for Macintosh scrap, replace
the script in step 2 with the following code:
<P>
<PRE>   tell application "Scriptable Text Editor"
      activate  -- force the generation of a suspend event in FP for Mac
      paste
   end tell

   -- Return focus to FoxPro
   tell application "Microsoft FoxPro"
      activate
   end tell

</PRE></OL>Save and close the script, and then repeat steps 3, 4, and 5.
<P>
NOTE: If a substantial amount of data is passed through the Clipboard, the
Macintosh operating system may place the data in a temporary file. There is
no way to prevent this from happening other than to limit the amount of
data passed to the Clipboard.
