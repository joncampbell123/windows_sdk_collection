</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Visual FoxPro 3.0b is an international release of Visual FoxPro 3.0. Visual
FoxPro 3.0b is Double-Byte Character Set (DBCS) enabled, so it can be
localized into Far Eastern languages. In addition, Visual FoxPro 3.0b ships
with SQL Server 6.0 ODBC drivers, Windows 95 desktop ODBC drivers, and
provides enhanced support for OLE Controls. This article provides some
general information about Visual FoxPro 3.0b.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Q. Why is this version called Visual FoxPro 3.0b? What happened to version
<PRE>   3.0a?

</PRE>A. Version 3.0a is a Double-Byte Character Set (DBCS) enabled release for
<PRE>   the Far East only. Visual FoxPro 3.0b is a worldwide release that
   supports DBCS and is also the version that synchronizes Visual FoxPro
   with the final releases of Win32s and Open Database Connectivity (ODBC).

</PRE>Q. Do I need to update my Visual FoxPro 3.0 to version 3.0b?
<P>
A. The main focus of the update is to enable DBCS support for
<PRE>   the Far Eastern languages and to meet the OLE Controls Container
   specification. Developers who need OLE Control support, improved Win32s
   support, or the other product enhanccements probably do want to update
   to Visual FoxPro 3.0b.

</PRE>Q. I only want the ODBC drivers. What should I do?
<P>
A. The current versions of Office 95, Standalone Microsoft Excel, Microsoft
<PRE>   Project, and Microsoft Visual Basic 4.0 already contain the Windows 95
   desktop ODBC drivers, so you might already have them. The SQL Server 6.0
   ODBC driver and the Windows 95 desktop drivers included with 3.0b are
   also available as an application note on the Web, The Microsoft Network,
   or the Microsoft FTP site.

   For more information about how to obtain these drivers, please see the
   following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../odbc/q139487.htm">Q139487</A></B>
   TITLE     : INF: WX1220: ODBC Drivers Appnote

</PRE>Q. If I do want the actual update, how can I get it?
<P>
A. Call Microsoft directly and get it shipped to you when it is available.
<PRE>   You will only be required to pay Cost of Goods ($19.95 - subject to
   change) and shipping and handling.

</PRE>Q. Why isn't this just a downloadable patch?
<P>
A. Because DBCS was enabled in Visual FoxPro, the entire product is
<PRE>   affected. Therefore, you need to reinstall the product to update it.

</PRE>Q. What version of Windows NT do I need?
<P>
A. Visual FoxPro 3.0b requires Windows NT 3.51. This is stated on the box
<PRE>   as a requirement and is also in the Readme.hlp file.

</PRE>Q. Why have I heard about a 3.0c release?
<P>
A. Microsoft re-manufactured the 3.0b build and Microsoft's manufacturing
<PRE>   group considered using the name Visual FoxPro 3.0c. However, this name
   was not adopted and there is not a version of Visual FoxPro 3.0c.
