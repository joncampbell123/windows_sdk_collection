</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article shows you the steps to create and use an offline view within
Visual FoxPro 5.0.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
With the following steps, you can create a sample offline view using the
data from the Testdata database from the Samples\Data directory.

<OL><P><LI>Create a new directory called Myoffline, and make it the default
    directory.

<P><LI>Open the Testdata database in the C:\VFP\Samples\Data directory.

<P><LI>Create a new .dbc file called Mydbc, and modify this database.

<P><LI>Within Mydbc, create a new Local View from the Customer table and
    include all fields as output. Check Send SQL Updates, and mark the
    Cust_ID field as modifiable in the Update criteria tab.
<P>
    NOTE: An offline view does not have to be from a local view; it can
    also come from a remote view, adding more power to this feature.

<P><LI>Close and save the view, and name it Myview.

<P><LI>From the Command window issue the command:
<P>
       ? CREATEOFFLINE("MYVIEW")
<P>
    If the command executes successfully, it returns a .T., and now if you
    look at the files in the Myoffline directory, you should see three
    extra files with the following names:
<P>
       Myview.dbf
       Myview.tbf
       Myview.tdx
<P>
    The view Myview is now considered offline. You can take the contents of
    the MYOFFLINE folder anywhere and make changes to the data in Myview
    view.

<P><LI>Issue a CLOSE All command from the Command window to close all the
    files.

<P><LI>Next issue the following commands from the Command window:
<P>
       SET MULTILOCKS ON
       OPEN DATABASE MYDBC
       USE MYVIEW
       BROWSE
<P>
    Multilocks must be set on in order to use the view. You can look at the
    records and modify them.

<P><LI>Modify or append a couple of records. Because the view is offline, only
    the records in Myview.dbf are actually changed. Nothing is being
    changed in the Customer table.

<P><LI>Issue a USE command to close Myview.

<P><LI>To update the Customer table, issue the following commands:
<P>
       OPEN DATABASE c:\vfp\samples\data\testdata
       USE Customer
       ? CURSORSETPROP("Buffering",5)
       USE Myview ONLINE EXCLUSIVE IN 0
       SELECT Myview
       ? TABLEUPDATE(.T.)
<P>
    If you BROWSE the Customer table, you should see your changes. You must
    open the view with the ONLINE clause, and it must be exclusive in order
    to update. Also the table and database the view is representing, in
    this case Customer, must be open.

<P><LI>To make Myview a normal view or one that is considered ONLINE, you must
    use the DROPOFFLINE()function, which deletes the three files that you
    created in the Myoffline directory. Any changes made to the view are
    reflected in the Customer table.
