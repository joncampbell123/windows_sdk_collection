The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0 and 3.0b
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Starting Tastrade.app causes the following error message to appear:
<P>
<PRE>   Variable "TITLE" is not found.
   &lt;Cancel&gt; &lt;Suspend&gt; &lt;Ignore&gt; &lt;Help&gt;

</PRE>If you click Ignore, the error message will appear with NOTES replacing
TITLE as the variable not found. This will occur several more times, each
with a different variable such as PHOTO_FILE and PASSWORD.
<P>
NOTE: The error is not displayed immediately upon starting Tastrade.app if
the introductory screen appears. To cause the error message to appear,
click the Continue button on the Introductory form.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
COMPATIBLE has been set to ON or DB4.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
The short-term solution is to issue the following command in the Command
window before running Tastrade.app:
<P>
<PRE>   SET COMPATIBLE OFF

</PRE>The permanent solution is to modify the Environment class in the Tsgen
class library as described below.
<P>
<P><h3>Step-by-Step Workaround</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Open the Tastrade.pjx project file located in the VFP\Samples\Mainsamp
   directory.

<P><LI>Click the Classes tab. Drill down in the Tsgen class library, and select
   the Environment library. Click the Modify button to edit the library.

<P><LI>With the Environment class open in design mode, click New Property on
   the Class menu. In the Name box, enter the following variable name:
<P>
   cOldCompatible

<P><LI>Ensure that the properties sheet of the class is open by choosing
   Properties from the View menu. Click the Methods tab on the properties
   sheet.

<P><LI>Double-click the Init event, and add the following line of code at the
   end of the current code:
<P>
   this.cOldCompatible = SET('COMPATIBLE')
<P>
   Close and save the Init event.

<P><LI>From the Methods tab in the Property sheet, double-click the Reset
   method, and add the code at the end of the current code:
<P>
   lutemp = this.cOldCompatible
   SET COMPATIBLE &amp;lutemp
<P>
   Close and save the method.

<P><LI>Double-click the Set method in the Methods tab of the Property sheet and
   enter the following line of code at the end of the current code:
<P>
   SET COMPATIBLE OFF
<P>
   Close and save the method.

<P><LI>Close and save the Environment class. In the Project Manager, click the
   Build option button, and then click Build Application under options, and
   choose OK. The Save As dialog box appears. Either take the default name
   for the application, or enter a new name to leave the original
   application intact if necessary.
<P>
