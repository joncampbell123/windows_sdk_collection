The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, version 2.6a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Graphical Help does not work after doing a Workstation installation and
running FoxPro for Macintosh version 2.6 off an Administrative installation
on a network file server. Nothing happens when Help is called by pressing
F1, typing HELP in the FoxPro Command window, or choosing Microsoft FoxPro
Help from the Balloon Help menu(or CMD+?).
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
FoxPro can't find the Microsoft Help engine or FoxPro Help Engine that are
both supposed to be installed in the Microsoft folder on the workstation's
hard drive. The Workstation installation will create the Microsoft folder
and put the files necessary for spell checking in it, but it doesn't put
the Help files in it.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
The FoxPro Help Engine and Microsoft Help can be copied from the
Administrative installation on the network file server and placed in the
Microsoft folder to enable Graphical Help. These files will be located in
the __SetupAdmin__ folder that is found where the Administrative
installation is located on the network file server.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in
Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The FoxPro Graphical Help file will be located on the file server by
default.
<P>
You can use the SET command to check to see if HELP is turned on and to
find out which Help file FoxPro is looking for. The syntax for using the
SET command in the FoxPro Command window and the results are shown below:
<P>
<PRE>   Command            Result
   -----------------------------------------------------
   ? SET("Help")      ON
   ? SET("Help",1)    &lt;path to admin install&gt;\FOXHELP.HLP

</PRE>Instead of using Graphical Help, you can use the .DBF style help. Type the
following command in the FoxPro Command window to set help to .DBF style:
<P>
<PRE>   SET HELP TO SYS(2004)+"FoxHelp.dbf"

</PRE>NOTE: Other Microsoft applications, such as Microsoft Word version 6.0 and
Microsoft Excel version 5.0 for the Apple Macintosh will create a Microsoft
folder and may have already placed the Microsoft Help file in the folder.
