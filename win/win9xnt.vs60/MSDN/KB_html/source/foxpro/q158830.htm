The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0b
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If an OptionGroup control has the alphabetic characters "M," "P," "H," and
"K," as hot keys, and the user moves through the OptionGroup using the
direction (or arrow) keys, the Valid event fires.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
For the Option button that has "M" as the hot key, add the following
command to the GotFocus of this Option button:
<P>
<PRE>   ON KEY LABEL RIGHTARROW KEYBOARD '{DNARROW}'

</PRE>For the hot key "H," place the following command in the GotFocus:
<P>
<PRE>   ON KEY LABEL UPARROW KEYBOARD '{LEFTARROW}'

</PRE>For the hot key "K," place the following command in the GotFocus:
<P>
<PRE>   ON KEY LABEL LEFTARROW KEYBOARD '{UPARROW}'

</PRE>For the hot key "P," place the following command in the GotFocus:
<P>
<PRE>   ON KEY LABEL DNARROW KEYBOARD '{RIGHTARROW}'

</PRE>Then add the ON KEY command to the LostFocus of each Option button to
restore all keys to their default behavior.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem has been corrected in
Visual FoxPro 5.0 for Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If the option button has a hot key that begins with an "M," pressing the
right-arrow key fires the Valid event of the option button. If the hot key
is an "H," the up-arrow fires the Valid. If the hotkey is a "K," the left-
arrow fires the Valid, and if it is a "P," the down-arrow fires the Valid.
In addition, when the option button uses these hot keys, the focus does not
leave that particular option button when pressing the arrow key that fires
the Valid.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create a form.

<P><LI>Add an OptionGroup control to the form from the Form Controls toolbar.

<P><LI>Change the ButtonCount property to four in the Property sheet.

<P><LI>Click the OptionGroup control to select it, then right-click it to bring
   up the shortcut menu. Click Edit.

<P><LI>In the OptionGroup, click on the Option1 button. Change the Caption
   property to "\&lt;Microsoft" in the Property sheet.

<P><LI>Open the Valid event from the Methods tab of the Property sheet. Enter
   the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      WAIT WINDOW "Here in valid" TIMEOUT 1
</PRE><P>
</OL>Repeat steps 4 through 6, but enter "\&lt;H", "\&lt;K", and "\&lt;P" in the Caption
property for each of the three remaining option buttons.
<P>
Run the form and attempt to move off of each of the option buttons using
right-arrow for the "M" hot key, the up-arrow for "H," left-arrow for "K,"
and down-arrow for "P."
