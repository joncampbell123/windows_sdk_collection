The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a
<LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use a view to create another view, you may receive this error when
you run the second view:
<P>
<PRE>   Base table fields have been changed and no longer match view fields.

</PRE>After you try to modify the view, this error occurs:
<P>
<PRE>   Invalid File Descriptor.

</PRE>Visual FoxPro (VFP) for Windows closes with an Illegal Operation error in
Windows 95 or you receive a Vfp.exe Application Error in Windows NT 4.0.
<P>
In Visual FoxPro for Macintosh you receive the two error messages but
the application does not close.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
The second view must be deleted from the database and re-created while
adding all of the fields from the first view.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you work with views, if a field is removed in the base table or in a
view that another view is based on, you expect the "Base table fields"
error message to occur. Because the field in the second view is trying to
update a field in the first view or the base table and that field is not
there, this error should occur. Unfortunately, this error also occurs if
one or more fields are left out when you create each view. For example, if
a view is created on a table and the "First Name" field is removed and then
a second view is created based on the first view with the "Last Name" field
removed, the error occurs. The tables and views have to be closed and the
Send SQL check box must be selected in the Update Criteria tab of View
Designer for the error to occur.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Open and modify the Testdata sample database located in the
    \Vfp\Samples\Data folder.

<P><LI>Create a view using the Customer table. In the Database Designer,
    right-click the mouse and select New Local View. Using the Fields tab,
    add fields to the view and leave out the Contact field.

<P><LI>Click the Update Criteria tab, and then select a key field. Next, click
    the Update All command button and select the "Send SQL Updates" check
    box.

<P><LI>Save the view as Cust_view1.

<P><LI>Create a second view based on the view you just created, leaving out
    the Address field.

<P><LI>Follow step 4 and save the view as Cust_view2.

<P><LI>In the FoxPro Command window, type CLOSE TABLES and press ENTER.

<P><LI>Double click the Cust_view2 view in the Database Designer. The
    following error occurs:
<P>
       Base table fields have been changed and no longer match view fields.
<P>
</OL>Trying to modify the view results produces an "Invalid File Descriptor"
error followed by an Illegal Operation error in Windows 95 or you receive
a Vfp.exe Application Error in Windows NT 4.0 that closes down Visual
FoxPro for Windows.
