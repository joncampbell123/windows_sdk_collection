<P><h3>Font Considerations</h3>
 
<P>
When designing applications that will be used in 1024x768 (not small
font) video resolution, keep in mind that FoxFont is only a small
font. This means that as other fonts are expanded to appear larger in
that mode, FoxFont stays the same. This may cause problems in
applications that have multiple windows on the screen at the same
time, or applications that use specific placement of bitmaps. For
this reason, FoxFont should not be used as the base font when defining
these application windows. Instead, use a common font that is
supplied with Windows:

<OL><P><LI>Set the font of the main FoxPro window to a standard Windows font
   such as MS Sans Serif 8.
<P>
   (NOTE: This information in the online Help file incorrectly suggests the
   use of MS Sans Serif 10.)

<P><LI>Define, generate and position your application's windows while
   using this font.

<P><LI>Set the font of the main FoxPro window to your chosen font at the
   start of your application (or in the startup code snippet).
   Remember to set it back to its initial value at the end of your
   application (or in the cleanup code snippet).
<P>
</OL><h3>Available Font</h3>
 
<P>
To find out if the font you want to use is available, use AFONT().
<P>
<P><h3>Mono-Spaced and Proportional Fonts</h3>
 
<P>
The FONTMETRIC() function is useful in determining whether a font is
mono- or proportionally-spaced. If FONT(6) = FONT(7), then the font is
mono-spaced.
<P>
<P><h3>Text Editor</h3>
 
<P>
To select an entire line of text (including the carriage return) when
editing, triple-click on the line.
<P>
To move or copy selected text, use "drag-and-drop". You can drag a
copy of the text by holding down the Ctrl key as you drag the selected
text. When you use drag and drop, FoxPro places the dragged text on
the clipboard. Anything on the clipboard when you use drag and drop
is overwritten.
<P>
To indent and unindent large sections of code or text, use Indent and
Undent on the Text menu.
<P>
<P><h3>Color in Pictures</h3>
 
<P>
If the colors of a picture you are displaying do not look as expected,
try using SET PALETTE OFF to display the picture using the color
palette it was created with instead of FoxPro's default color palette.
Chances are that a different color palette was used when the picture
was originally created. But note that it does affect all pictures
displayed.
<P>
<P><h3>Bitmaps/Wallpaper</h3>
 
<P>
When using a bitmap as wallpaper, try to use bitmaps that look good on
screens of various sizes. If an application must use a wallpaper that
requires objects to be in a specific location (for example, a button
must always be on Bobo's nose), use the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Create one bitmap scaled for 1024x768 large fonts.(BOBO.LRG)

<P><LI>Create another bitmap scaled for all others.(BOBO.SML)

<P><LI>At the beginning of the application, check FONTMETRIC(1) to see if
   small or large fonts are loaded. For example, FONTMETRIC(1,'MS
   SANS SERIF',8) always returns 13 if small fonts are loaded and 16
   for large fonts.

<P><LI>Copy the appropriate bitmap file to the one used for the wallpaper.
   (for example, BOBO.SML =&gt; BOBO.BMP)
<P>
</OL><h3>Customizing the Main FoxPro Window</h3>
 
<P>
You can modify the main FoxPro window using the MODIFY WINDOW SCREEN
command. This command allows you to set various attributes of the
window including font, font size, font style, wallpaper, color, icon
file, title, size, and so on. You can also use the ZOOM WINDOW SCREEN
command to maximize and minimize the main FoxPro window.
<P>
The MODIFY WINDOW SCREEN command restores the main FoxPro window to
the size it was when FoxPro for Windows was launched. This size is
stored in the FOXPRO.INI file and is saved when you exit FoxPro.
<P>
The ZOOM WINDOW SCREEN NORM command restores the FoxPro window to the
size it was before you used a ZOOM WINDOW SCREEN MAX or ZOOM WINDOW
SCREEN MIN command.
<P>
Notice that you can issue multiple MODIFY WINDOW commands to adjust
different characteristics of a window without changing characteristics
that you've already set.
<P>
To change the font of the main FoxPro window, hold down the Shift key
and choose Screen Font... from the Text menu. You can also change the
font with the MODIFY WINDOW SCREEN command.
<P>
With the Screen Builder, you can create a DESKTOP window in the Window
Style dialog. This option allows you to customize the main FoxPro
window.
<P>
<P><h3>Icon Placement</h3>
 
<P>
To place a minimized window icon in a specific location, try this:
<P>
<PRE>   DEFINE WINDOW x FROM 10,10 TO 20,20 MINIMIZE FLOAT CLOSE
   ACTIVATE WINDOW x NOSHOW
   ZOOM WINDOW x MIN
   MOVE WINDOW x TO 1,1
   SHOW WINDOW x

</PRE></OL><h3>Right Mouse Button</h3>
 
<P>
You can set your right mouse button to emulate the Enter key by using
ON KEY LABEL RIGHTMOUSE KEYBOARD CHR(13). Now, you can press the
right mouse button instead of the Enter key to execute commands,
select items, and so on.
<P>
<P><h3>Closing Multiple Windows</h3>
 
<P>
To close several windows at one time, hold down the Shift key and
choose Close All from the File menu. You can temporarily hide all
windows by simultaneously pressing SHIFT+CTRL+ALT.
<P>
<P><h3>Password Protection</h3>
 
<P>
If your application requires a password, try using a font size that is
too small to read or a password font in which all the characters are
the same.
<P>
<P><h3>Frontmost Window</h3>
 
<P>
You can create windows which can exist outside the main FoxPro window
using the IN DESKTOP clause. These windows look like normal FoxPro
windows but behave differently.
<P>
An IN DESKTOP window always remains in front of any other window, even
if you open another window later. WONTOP() will always return the IN
DESKTOP window. This is especially important in event-driven programs.
IN DESKTOP can also be used to simulate a "floating palette" which
always stays on top of the active window. Floating palettes are common
in Microsoft Windows and Macintosh software products.
<P>
The location of IN DESKTOP windows is determined by the Microsoft
Windows coordinate system. Normal user-defined windows use FoxPro's
coordinate system.
