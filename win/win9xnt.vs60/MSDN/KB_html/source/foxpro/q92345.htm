The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0
<LI>Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS, versions 2.0, 2.5, and 2.5a
<LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5 and 2.5a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When a command requires a file lock and the corresponding file is not
already locked, FoxPro attempts to lock the file. Similarly, when a command
requires a record lock and the corresponding record is not already locked,
FoxPro attempts to lock the record. If the lock attempt is successful,
FoxPro executes the command and releases the lock.
<P>
For a list of commands that automatically lock a file or individual
records, see the table below.
<P>
Use manual locking commands in the following situations:

<UL><LI>When you are editing a database with the CHANGE or EDIT command and a
   format file.

<LI>When you are editing a database using a memory variable and a command
   such as SCATTER. Note that the GATHER command locks each record as it
   updates the database; however, not locking the record during the editing
   process can introduce data-integrity problems.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following commands automatically lock a file or individual records,
as indicated:
