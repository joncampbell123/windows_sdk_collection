<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
FoxPro currently supports some aspects of Microsoft Windows for Pen
Computing. Applications created with FoxPro for Windows can be run
with Windows for Pen Computing.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Applications written using Microsoft FoxPro for Windows can access all
buttons, menus, and fields through the pen, and text can be entered in
the fields through the pen. The text recognition feature of Windows
for Pen Computing works normally--text that is input with the pen is
immediately translated into typed text.
<P>
However, there currently is no support for inking (the display of a
pen's activity); moreover, unrecognized text cannot be stored in text
fields, nor can stored ink be recognized later. Although there is no
direct support for it, you can store ink in general fields; for
example, you can store an OLE Paintbrush picture drawn with a pen in a
general field.
<P>
No extra applications are needed to create a FoxPro application to run
with Windows for Pen Computing. However, the Microsoft Windows version
3.1 Software Development Kit (SDK) is recommended if you are going to
develop a Windows for Pen Computing application to run with FoxPro.
