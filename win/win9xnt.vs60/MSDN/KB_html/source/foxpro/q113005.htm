The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, version 2.6
<LI>Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS, version 2.6
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The FoxPro Catalog Manager uses the FoxPro resource file, FOXUSER.DBF, to
store information about the Catalog Manager environment. Since these
preferences are likely to be unique for every user, each user should be
assigned his or her own resource file.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When the Catalog Manager starts up, it attempts to read the current
resource file to determine the following user preferences:

<UL><LI>Catalog Name - The last catalog used during the last Catalog Manager
   session.

<LI>Catalog Manager Settings - The Catalog Manager environment settings such
   as BELL, EXACT, and EXCLUSIVE. You can access these settings by choosing
   Settings from the Tools menu in the Catalog Manager. Note that these
   settings are stored with the resource file and not with a catalog;
   therefore, the settings apply to the Catalog Manager environment in
   general, not a specific catalog.

<LI>Table Name - The last table or query used during the last Catalog
   Manager session.

<LI>Active Tab - The last tab activated during the last Catalog Manager
   session.

<LI>Show Paths - The setting that determines whether paths are displayed in
   the Files list box of the Catalog Manager.
<P>
</UL>This information is stored as individual records in the active resource
file. To demonstrate this behavior, type the following sequence of commands
in the Command window:
<P>
<PRE>   USE SYS(2005) AGAIN      &amp;&amp; open the current FOXUSER file
   BROWSE FOR ID='CATALOG'  &amp;&amp; browse the catalog preferences

</PRE>If a resource file is not in use, these preferences will not be saved, and
the user will be asked to open a catalog each time he or she enters the
Catalog Manager environment. If a resource file is in use but marked as
read-only, the user will receive the following error when attempting to
start and later leave the Catalog Manager:
<P>
<PRE>   Error 111 (Cannot write to a read-only file.) occurred while writing
   the preference to &lt;path&gt;\FOXUSER.DBF.

</PRE>The error occurs because the Catalog Manager is unable to write the
preferences listed above to the resource file.
<P>
FoxPro catalog files (.FPC), like FoxPro project files (.PJX), are single-
user objects; therefore, preferences will be unique for each user, and each
user should be assigned his or her own resource file to increase the user's
productivity if the user often finds himself or herself using the same
catalog during several consecutive FoxPro sessions. To accomplish this, the
CONFIG.FP or CONFIG.FPW configuration file should specify a path to a
unique resource file.
<P>
For more information about the FoxPro configuration file, see the
"Customizing FoxPro" section of the "Installation and Configuration"
manual.
