<P>
Please read this information entirely before installing the
Professional Edition.
When you are ready to run the setup program, CLOSE THIS FILE FIRST.
 
Contents
 
<P>
<PRE>Part     Description

</PRE><P><LI>       System Requirements
<PRE>2.        Before You Install
3.        Network Installations
4.        Installation Types
5.        Installation Instructions
6.        Installing FoxPro Professional Kits

</PRE><P><LI>System Requirements
</OL> 
FoxPro 2.6 will only run on System 7.0 or higher and 68020 or higher
based machines.  System 6 and machines with a 68000 (Macintosh 128,
512, Plus, SE and Classic) are not supported.  For specific
requirements for FoxPro for Macintosh and FoxPro for Power Macintosh,
see Part 4, "Installation Types."

<OL><P><LI> Before You Install
</OL> 
<UL><LI>If you already have the Standard Edition of FoxPro 2.6 installed,
   you must run its Microsoft FoxPro Setup program to remove FoxPro
   before installing the Professional Edition.
</UL>1. Double click the Setup folder on your hard disk and start Microsoft
<PRE>   FoxPro Setup.
</PRE></OL>2. From the Setup dialog choose the Remove All button to delete
<PRE>   FoxPro.
</PRE>3. Exit Setup.
4. Follow the instructions shown in Part 5, "Installation
<PRE>   Instructions" of this Readme.

</PRE><LI>Some system extensions may conflict with the Microsoft FoxPro Setup
   program. To avoid this, turn off virus checkers and/or restart your
   Macintosh while holding down the Shift key while the system starts
   up and until you see the screen that says "Welcome to Macintosh."
   A line saying that extensions are off will appear as the machine
   starts.

<LI>Close the Chooser before running the setup program.

<LI>Make sure that you have Geneva 10  or Chicago 12 fonts on your
   Macintosh. FoxPro requires these fonts.

<LI>If you're using the 68K Macintosh version and you choose the
   Complete installation option, the Setup program will not prompt you
   for disk 7.  Even though Setup does not prompt you for disk 7, the
   FoxPro for Macintosh installation is complete.

<LI>If you have FoxPro 2.5 already installed, Setup will install FoxPro
   2.6 in the same folder unless you specify a new folder name during
   the installation. If you still want to build version 2.5
   executables, we recommend installing FoxPro 2.6 in a separate
   folder. If you want to install FoxPro 2.6 in the same folder as
   FoxPro 2.5, and you aren't going to build 2.5 executables, follow
   the installation defaults. After setup is complete, you can remove
   the 2.5 .ESL file manually to save space on your hard disk.  Setup
   does not remove the 2.5 .ESL file automatically.

<LI>If FoxPro setup reports low memory error messages during
   installation, you should allocate more memory to the setup program.
<P>
</UL>To allocate more memory to setup
1. Double-click on the Setup Folder icon on disk 1.
2. Single click on the Microsoft Setup icon.
3. Press Command+I.
<P>
This will allow you to change the memory requirements for setup.

<OL><P><LI> Network Installations
</OL> 
If you are installing Microsoft FoxPro on a network server, see the
FoxPro Readme - Network file, which is located on Install Disk 1.
<P>

<OL><P><LI> About the Installation Types
</OL> 
During installation, you are asked to choose an installation type that
is dependent upon the type of computer you have.

<UL><LI> Microsoft FoxPro for the Power Macintosh
</UL>Installs a copy of Microsoft FoxPro that is optimized to run on the
Power Macintosh. This option is not available when Setup is run on
standard Macintosh systems.

<UL><LI> Microsoft FoxPro for the Macintosh
</UL>Installs a copy of Microsoft FoxPro that is optimized to run on
Macintosh models with a 68020 or higher microprocessor. If installed
on a Power Macintosh, Microsoft FoxPro runs in Macintosh emulation
mode, and consequently runs slower.

<UL><LI> Microsoft FoxPro for the Macintosh and Power Macintosh
</UL>Installs a copy of Microsoft FoxPro that is optimized to run on either
Macintosh or Power Macintosh. This option requires more disk space,
and is intended for installation on Power Macintosh workstations or
Macintosh workstations that have a Power Macintosh compatible upgrade
card installed. When installing Microsoft FoxPro on a network server,
it is recommended that network administrators who have users with both
Macintosh and Power Macintosh systems choose the Macintosh and Power
Macintosh installation types. This allows a single server installation
to service users of either system.  That is, when a Macintosh user
starts FoxPro, FoxPro for Macintosh starts, and when a Power Macintosh
users starts FoxPro, FoxPro for Power Macintosh starts.
<P>
System Requirements for the Professional Edition of the combined
Macintosh and Power Macintosh installation type are as follows:
<P>
Memory:
- 8 megabytes
<P>
Hard Disk Space:
<UL><LI>Complete installation, 47 megabytes
<LI>Custom installation, required disk space depends on the options you
   choose
<LI>Minimum installation, 16.5 megabytes
<P>
</UL>*Note*
The figures shown above are final installation sizes. During the
installation process, Setup needs approximately 7 megabytes of
additional space on the hard disk in order to proceed properly. This
space is used only during installation, and becomes available again
once installation is complete.
<P>

<OL><P><LI> Installation Instructions
</OL> 
To install FoxPro:

<OL><P><LI>Insert Install Disk 1 into your disk drive.
</OL>2. Double-click the Microsoft FoxPro Setup program.
3. Follow the instructions on the screen.
<P>
If you need to escape from the setup program and cannot access the
Exit Setup button, press Option+Command+Esc.
<P>
Note:  If you want to install FoxPro 2.6 on a network, see the "FoxPro
Readme - Network" document on this disk.
<P>
<P><h3>6: Installing FoxPro Professional Kits</h3>
 
<P>
The FoxPro Professional Kits consist of the following:
<UL><LI>Distribution Kit
<LI>Connectivity Kit
<LI>Library Construction Kit
<P>
</UL>You can specify which of the Professional Kits to install by using the
Custom install option in Setup. First specify if you want to install
for Macintosh only or for both Macintosh and Power Macintosh using the
option buttons on the Setup dialog.
<P>
Setup displays a tree of options for installing each part of FoxPro,
including an option for installing the FoxPro Professional Kits.  You
can expand or collapse the option tree to view the different kits.
You can select or deselect each option using the check boxes in the
tree.
<P>
**Note**
If you are installing for the Macintosh only (not the Power
<PRE>Macintosh),  and you are also   installing the Distribution Kit and
</PRE></OL>you want to distribute applications for the Macintosh (68k) only, be
sure to clear the check box option for the FoxPro Runtime Library for
Power Macintosh. You won't need these files and they will just take up
disk space.
<P>
<P><h3>Notes on the Connectivity Kit</h3>
 
<P>
In addition to the basic system requirements, you need the following
hardware and software to use the Connectivity Kit:

<UL><LI>MacTCP driver
<LI>TCP/IP address
<P>
</UL>You must be able to connect to your data source at the network or
operating system level by using TCP/IP through the MacTCP driver.
Since the Macintosh does not have an equivalent of the Netlib API as
on Windows, the ODBC driver will support only TCP/IP. Therefore you
will need to have MacTCP software in your Control Panel folder and an
IP address to be able to establish connection.
