The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.6, 2.6a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When accessing a Banyan VINES network drive in FoxPro version 2.6 for
Windows with the Open dialog box or with Filer, there are no files or
subdirectories listed. This occurs when running Windows 95 and using the 32-
bit network driver that comes from Banyan VINES.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Changing to the "Banyan DOS/Windows 3.1 Client" 16-bit driver that comes
with Windows 95 allows FoxPro 2.6 to see files or subdirectories on the
Banyan VINES network.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Windows 95 comes with a Banyan VINES network driver (a 16-bit network
driver), listed as "Banyan DOS/Windows 3.1 Client" under the Network icon
in Control Panel. FoxPro for Windows, version 2.5 or 2.6, can see files on
the network if you use this driver.
<P>
If you use the Banyan VINES 32-bit network driver that Banyan supplies to
connect to the network in Windows 95, FoxPro for Windows, version 2.6, sees
the root directory of the network drive but does not see any files in that
directory or any subdirectories under the root directory. When using any
other 16-bit application or Windows Explorer, you can see the files
properly while the 32-bit driver is installed.
<P>
For more information about setting up the 16-bit Banyan VINES driver,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../win95x/q123877.htm">Q123877</A></B>
   TITLE     : How to Set Up Banyan VINES in Windows 95

</PRE>NOTE: Also make sure that the user has the correct rights to the network;
otherwise, they may not be able to see any files.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 
<P>
If the Banyan DOS/Windows 3.1 Client network driver is already installed on
Windows 95, any files and subdirectories located on a network drive should
be available in FoxPro. To reproduce the problem, contact Banyan to get the
32-bit network driver and install it on Windows 95.
<P>
After the installation of the 32-bit driver, go to a mapped network drive
and notice that you can see only the root directory. You cannot see any
files or subdirectories on the root directory.
<P>
If the Banyan VINES 32-bit driver is already installed, notice that no
files or subdirectories are visible on the network drive when viewing in
FoxPro. Refer to the Knowledge Base article above, follow the steps in that
article to install the 16-bit driver that comes with Windows 95, and notice
that the files and subdirectories are visible.
