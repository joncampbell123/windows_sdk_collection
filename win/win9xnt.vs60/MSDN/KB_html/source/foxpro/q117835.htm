The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5, 2.5a, 2.5b, 2.6
<LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, versions 2.5b, 2.5c, 2.6a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you open a project in FoxPro for Windows after the project has been
created or modified by FoxPro for Macintosh, the error message "Invalid
path or filename" is displayed. This error occurs when the project is
located on a network drive and is accessed by both FoxPro for Macintosh and
FoxPro for Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when a screen is included in the project and the screen
is generated while the default folder is a folder on the Macintosh hard
disk. Opening the project (.PJX) file as a database and examining the
contents of the Name field for a record of Type capital "S" shows that the
Macintosh hard disk and folder name precede the .SPR filename. This entry
in the .PJX file is created when the project regenerates the screen file
during rebuilding. The rebuilding process shows the screen being
regenerated on the network drive. However, the name written to the .PJX
file is preceded by the default folder name.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Changing the default folder to the network drive and folder will allow the
project to be opened successfully from both platforms. The Name field in
the .PJX file for the record(s) of Type capital "S" will now show only the
name of the .SPR file (the path isn't included).
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in
FoxPro for Macintosh version 2.6a.
<P>
NOTE: This problem does not occur in FoxPro for MS-DOS.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>In FoxPro for Macintosh, choose View from the Window menu, and then
   click the Folder button.

<P><LI>Select the Working folder and set it to the FoxPro folder on the
   Macintosh hard disk. (This is probably the default setting.)

<P><LI>Create a project by choosing New from the File menu and selecting
   Project.

<P><LI>Place a screen on the network drive. Add the screen to the project by
   clicking Add and selecting the screen.

<P><LI>Build the project. Note that the .SPR is being built on the network
   drive.

<P><LI>Close the project.

<P><LI>In FoxPro for Windows, choose Open from the File menu and select the
   project on the network drive. The message "Invalid path or filename"
   appears. Click on the Window menu, and the project name appears at the
   bottom of the Window menu. If you click the name of the project, an
   empty project screen appears.
