<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Once an array has been created with the COPY TO ARRAY command, the
array length remains constant even when a subsequent COPY TO ARRAY
command is issued. However, the SQL SELECT INTO ARRAY command creates
a new array each time it is issued.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following steps illustrate this behavior using the FoxPro 2.x CUSTOMER
table:

<OL><P><LI>In the Command window, issue the following commands:
<P>
<P><PRE>      SET DEFAULT TO &lt;path to FoxPro TUTORIAL directory&gt;
      USE customer
</PRE>
<P><LI>Open the Debug window, and type "ALEN(arr)" (without the quotation
   marks). Observe the value displayed after issuing each of the
   following commands:
<P>
<P><PRE>      COPY TO ARRAY arr FIELDS state FOR state = "CA"
      * arr has 123 elements, all of which are "CA".
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      COPY TO ARRAY arr FIELDS state FOR state = "AK"
      * arr still has 123 elements, but issuing the command
      * DISPLAYMEMORY LIKE arr will show that only the first
      * element of arr is "AK"; the rest are "CA".
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: If the second COPY TO ARRAY command returns a smaller number
   of elements than those existing in the array, only that number of
   elements will be overwritten; the others will retain their former
   value.
<P>
   If the second COPY TO ARRAY command returns a larger number of
   elements than those existing in the array, the result set will be
   truncated to the number of elements in the array.
<P>
   To obtain correct results, you must use the RELEASE command to
   release the array between consecutive COPY TO ARRAY commands.

<P><LI>Observe the value of ALEN(arr) after issuing the following
   commands:
<P>
<P><PRE>      SELECT cno FROM customer INTO array arr WHERE state = "CA"
      * arr now has 123 elements, all of which are "CA".
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      SELECT cno FROM customer INTO ARRAY arr WHERE cno = "AK"
      * ALEN(arr) =1; the value is "AK".
</PRE><P>
