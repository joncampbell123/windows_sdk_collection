<P>
<P><h3>Invisible Buttons in Screens</h3>
 
<P>
Invisible buttons are a type of push button and can be created using
the push button tool in the Screen Builder toolbox.
<P>
<P><h3>Pictures Buttons in Screens</h3>
 
<P>
You can create picture screen controls such as push buttons, check
boxes and radio buttons using the SHOW GET command. In addition, you
can specify a separate picture file for each of the three states in
which a control can exist (enabled, selected, disable) as shown in
this example:
<P>
<PRE>   SHOW GET mybtn,7  PROMPT ;
      'EXITEN.PCT,EXITSEL.PCT,EXITDIS.PCT

</PRE><h3>Picture Files for Screen Controls</h3>
 
<P>
When using picture files in a set of controls, try to use picture
files that are the same size. You should also use picture files that
have a white (distinguishing) background so that when you disable
them, they will have a well defined outline. Try to use a picture
files that is slightly smaller than the overall control because extra
border space is added automatically.
<P>
<P><h3>Spinner Limits</h3>
 
<P>
When creating spinners, remember that the minimum and maximum settings
do not stop a user from typing in any value they desire. You must
specify range values to limit the values that users can type.
<P>
<P><h3>Override Snap to Grid</h3>
 
<P>
The Snap To Grid option in the Screen Builder allows you to align
objects to a grid defined in the Ruler/Grid dialog. To override the
Snap To Grid setting, hold down the CTRL key when moving an object. If
you are not sure whether objects are aligned, use the line tool to
create a temporary line for alignment purposes. Also, you can use the
Show Position menu option to display the exact coordinates of an
object in the status bar.
<P>
<P><h3>Single Platform Screens</h3>
 
<P>
If you are generating screens for use in FoxPro for Macintosh only,
make sure you have the Macintosh Objects Only option checked in the
Generate Screen dialog. This will reduce the amount of code generated
and the time it takes to generate code.
<P>
<P><h3>Transparent/Opaque Screen Objects</h3>
 
<P>
The Screen Builder allows you to apply a Mode attribute to certain
objects such as text. The Mode attribute can be opaque or transparent.
A text object's fill colors only appear if the object is opaque. Avoid
using a transparent mode on @...SAY commands which are refreshed with
different text. This will cause the old text to be overwritten on top
by the new text.
<P>
Since new objects can overwrite old objects, you may not see the
desired effect when creating transparent objects that toggle between
enabled and disabled states. You can, however, attain some interesting
and desired special effects using a transparent mode. For example, a
disabled control such as a check box dims the text prompt as well as
the box portion of the control. You can make the text prompt appear
enabled even though the check box is actually disabled. You simply
need to ENABLE and then DISABLE the control using the SHOW GET
command.
<P>
<P><h3>Read-Only Edit Regions in Screens</h3>
 
<P>
The @...EDIT command is used to create edit regions for memo fields on
screens. The Screen Builder does not have an option to make these
read-only. You can create a work around solution by defining the WHEN
clause of the edit region as an expression and typing in the following
code:
<P>
<PRE>   .T. NOMODIFY

</PRE><h3>Quick Screen</h3>
 
<P>
If you create a Quick Screen and you specify a column layout but only
get one column, one or more of your fields may be too wide for
multiple columns. Adjust the maximum field width in the Quick Screen
dialog and try again.
<P>
<P><h3>Templates for Screens and Reports</h3>
 
<P>
If you usually use settings in the Screen Builder or Report Writer
that are not the default (ruler settings, show position, and so on.),
consider creating a template with your custom settings and using the
template as the base for new screens or reports.
<P>
<P><h3>Circles in Screens and Reports</h3>
 
<P>
To create a circle (oval) in the Screen Builder or Report Writer, use
the rounded-rectangle tool to create the object, then double-click on
it and select the round button.
<P>
<P><h3>Size Report and Screen Fields</h3>
 
<P>
To easily size fields one character at a time, use FONTMETRIC(7) to
determine the maximum character width for the font you're using, then
set the horizontal grid to the maximum character width. When you size
fields, they will move one "character" at a time.
<P>
<P><h3>Drawing Multiple Objects in Screens and Reports</h3>
 
<P>
In the Screen Builder and Report Writer, after you select a tool from
the toolbox and draw an object, the selection pointer becomes the
active tool. To keep another tool active when drawing multiple objects
of the same type, double-click the tool. It will appear darkened when
it is selected in this manner.
<P>
<P><h3>Placing Objects in Screens and Reports</h3>
 
<P>
In FoxPro for Macintosh, the keyboard is the best device to use to
precisely place objects. When an object is selected, you can use the
arrow keys to move it 1 pixel at a time. Holding down the Shift key
while you use the arrow keys will resize the object.
<P>
<P><h3>Multi-Line Text Objects</h3>
 
<P>
You can create multi-line text objects in the Screen Builder and
Report Writer by pressing Enter to continue typing on the next line.
You are limited to 255 characters per text object.
<P>
<P><h3>Redo Quick Screen/Report/Menu</h3>
 
<P>
To redo a Quick Screen, Report or Menu, delete all of the objects and
choose the Quick Screen/Report/Menu option again.
<P>
<P><h3>Multi-Column Snaking Reports</h3>
 
<P>
Because FoxPro for Macintosh uses the same format for labels as it
does for reports, you can create multi-column snaking reports. In
fact, the .FRX and .LBX files are identical, and the REPORT FORM and
LABEL FORM commands are interchangeable.
<P>
<P><h3>AS Clause in RQBE</h3>
 
<P>
RQBE does not have a built-in way to create an AS clause to rename an
output column. To create an AS clause in RQBE, open the RQBE Select
Fields dialog and type the field name followed by the AS name in the
Functions/Expression box. This is especially handy when using a
function:
<P>
<PRE>   COUNT(people.name) AS 'Employees'

</PRE>NOTE: When FoxPro reopens a .QPR file, it will ignore the AS clause.
It still exists in the file until you save over it. This trick can be
quite useful with on-the-fly queries which don't need to be saved.
