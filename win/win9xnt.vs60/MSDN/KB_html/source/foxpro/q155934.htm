<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article provides general information about the OLE Automation Manager
and its use within Microsoft Visual FoxPro 5.0.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Automation Manager and Remote Automation Connection Manager components
were developed for Visual Basic 4.0. Visual FoxPro adopted these components
in an effort to avoid duplicate efforts as new technologies affecting
remote automation become available. There is nothing specific that these
components support in Visual Basic 4.0 that they do not support in Visual
FoxPro 5.0.
<P>
The Automation Manager component was developed for Visual Basic, but it is
actually written in C and handles all the remote procedure calls (RPCs) and
marshalling for remote automation. The Automation Manager program
(Autmgr32.exe) must be installed and running on the server machine in order
for the client to see the remote server. If an OLE callback is made from an
object reference passed by the client to the remote server, you must also
install the Automation Manager on the client machine.
<P>
NOTE: If the Automation Manager is not running, it is automatically
launched.
<P>
The Remote Automation Connection Manager (RacMan) is written in Visual
Basic 4.0 (Racmgr32.exe), which requires the distribution of the Visual
Basic run-time libraries. In addition, it uses some ActiveX controls.
RacMan's sole purpose is to handle registry settings that control remote
connectivity on the client side and client access on the server side. In
terms of registering servers remotely, RacMan requires that the server be
registered locally. The Setup Wizard uses a tool called Clireg32.dll that
allows you to register a server remotely without first actually having to
install it or register it locally.
