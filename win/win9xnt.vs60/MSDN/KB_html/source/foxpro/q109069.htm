<P><h3>General Interface Differences</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI> Q. What is QuickTime(TM)?
<P>
<P><PRE>    A. QuickTime is a technology developed by Apple Computer that
       allows the display of real-time animated sequences, commonly
       referred to as movies, in a standard format on Macintosh
       computers. QuickTime is similar to Microsoft Video for Windows,
       the technology available on the Windows platform. QuickTime
       movie clips can be stored in a general field of any FoxPro for
       Macintosh table. QuickTime requires the QuickTime system
       software extension available from Apple Computer.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. Is there a Macintosh substitute for dynamic data exchange
<P><PRE>       (DDE)?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. AppleScript(TM), Apple's official language for program-to-
       program communication, is a high-level, object-oriented
       language akin to HyperTalk(R), Apple's scripting language for
       HyperCard(R). AppleScripts work in conjunction with Apple
       events, a discrete set of commands and functions that describe
       how programs can work together on Macintosh computers running
       System 7.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       FoxPro for Macintosh supports the required set of Apple events-
       -open application, open document, print document, and quit
       application. FoxPro for Macintosh also supports the Do Script
       event, which allows other applications that support this event
       to tell FoxPro to perform almost any action. FoxPro for
       Macintosh supports the running of compiled scripts through the
       RUN SCRIPT command. For more information about AppleScript,
       contact the Apple Programmer's and Developer's Association
       (APDA). To learn more about Apple events, see "Inside
       Macintosh". For more information about the RUN SCRIPT command,
       see the FoxPro for Macintosh "Language Reference."
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. Can I replace the text editor provided with FoxPro for
<P><PRE>       Macintosh with my own the way I can in FoxPro for MS-DOS and
       Windows using the TEDIT=&lt;editor&gt; setting in my CONFIG.FP or
       CONFIG.FPW file?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. TEDIT is not supported in FoxPro for Macintosh. However, you
       can use the options found in the Edit Preferences dialog box to
       customize the FoxPro editor.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       If you still want to use a different editor, try using System
       7's task-switching ability. With enough RAM, you can edit your
       programs in the editor of your choice and switch back to FoxPro
       when you want to test your code. To switch between
       applications, either click a window belonging to the
       destination application, or choose the appropriate icon from
       the list of applications in the Application menu in the upper-
       right corner of the system menu bar, next to the Help menu.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. Does FoxPro for Macintosh support Windows .BMP files?
<P>
<P><PRE>    A. FoxPro for Macintosh lets you view .BMP files or convert them
       to PICT files for editing in an appropriate graphics editor.
       PICT is the universal picture file format supported most
       extensively on the Macintosh. You can view both picture formats
       by storing the data in the general field of a FoxPro table, or
       by using the Picture tool in the Report Writer or Screen
       Builder. FoxPro for Macintosh does not support the editing of
       pictures, only their display and storage.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. What's an alias?
<P>
<P><PRE>    A. A Macintosh alias, a feature available with System 7,
       simplifies access to Finder(TM) objects (folders and files). An
       alias is simply a pointer to the actual object, which may be
       buried deeply in the folder hierarchy of your hard disk. It is
       often convenient to place aliases of commonly accessed files on
       the Macintosh desktop. The operating system finds and opens the
       actual object to which the alias points.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       To create a Macintosh alias, select the desired object in the
       Finder. From the File menu, choose Make Alias. A new object is
       created, about 2K in size, which can be moved virtually
       anywhere (including across a network) as a representative of
       the original object.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       FoxPro commands like DO, USE, and SET DEFAULT TO do not
       recognize these aliases. Selecting an alias from within a
       dialog box, however, will open the original file since the
       dialog box contains the necessary code to resolve the alias.
</PRE><P>
</OL><h3>FoxPro Window Differences</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI> Q. Why do the windows in FoxPro for Macintosh have different-
<P><PRE>       style controls compared with the windows in FoxPro for MS-DOS
       and FoxPro for Windows?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. FoxPro for Macintosh has been designed to conform to the
       Apple(R) human interface guidelines for the Apple desktop
       interface. The book titled, "Human Interface Guidelines: The
       Apple Desktop Interface" (published by Addison-Wesley)
       describes these rules. Following its guidelines ensures that
       all applications designed for the Macintosh have the same look
       and feel, so that once you learn one application it is
       relatively easy to pick up another.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. Why can't I minimize FoxPro for Macintosh like I can
<P><PRE>       FoxPro for Windows?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. The Macintosh interface does not provide a control to minimize
       a window. Consequently, the MINIMIZE clause of the DEFINE
       WINDOW command does not operate in FoxPro for Macintosh.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       The Macintosh interface does, however, provide a control in the
       upper-right corner of a window to maximize the window or reduce
       it to its previous dimensions, a control in the lower-right
       corner to size the window, and a control in the upper-left
       corner to close the window.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       To hide a window, select the window by clicking it or choosing
       it from the Window menu. Then choose Hide from the Window menu.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. Why doesn't the FoxPro Desktop window display the sizing
<P><PRE>       control when it is the active window?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. According to the Apple human interface guidelines, you can
       define a window with such attributes. However, a design
       decision was made to provide the user with the maximum amount
       of desktop space. If the grow icon were included, you would
       lose several pixels for the display of your own objects.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. Why aren't my user-defined windows restricted to the
<P><PRE>       FoxPro for Macintosh Desktop window like they are in FoxPro for
       MS-DOS and FoxPro for Windows?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. In FoxPro for MS-DOS and FoxPro for Windows, windows are
       related to and limited by the boundaries of their "parent"
       window. DEFINE WINDOW and other commands create "child" windows
       that are "clipped" at the window boundaries of the main Desktop
       window. On the Macintosh, all windows reside on the Macintosh
       desktop, which means that you can move them beyond the
       boundaries of any other window, including the FoxPro Desktop
       window. A new system setting has been incorporated into FoxPro
       for Macintosh, allowing more flexibility in the placement of
       windows in the Macintosh environment. This property is
       controlled by the MACDESKTOP setting. By default, the
       MACDESKTOP setting is ON, so windows you define can be
       positioned anywhere on the Macintosh desktop. To emulate the
       MS-DOS and Windows platform behavior, issue the following command
       in the Command window:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>          SET MACDESKTOP OFF

        NOTE: The MDI and NO MDI clauses of the DEFINE WINDOW command
        do not operate in FoxPro for Macintosh.

</PRE><P><LI> Q. Can I get the FoxPro for Macintosh status bar to restrict
<P><PRE>       itself to the FoxPro desktop window?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. By default, the status bar in FoxPro for Macintosh appears
       across the bottom of the monitor, as opposed to across the
       bottom of the FoxPro desktop window. To emulate the MS-DOS and
       Windows products, use the SET STATUS ON command. This displays
       the MS-DOS-style status bar within the FoxPro desktop window.
</PRE><P>
</OL><h3>Keyboard Differences</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI> Q. Why do some of the keyboard shortcuts in FoxPro for
<P><PRE>       Macintosh differ from their FoxPro for MS-DOS and FoxPro for
       Windows counterparts?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. Macintosh keyboard shortcuts represent traditional Macintosh
       features combined with the cross-platform functionality of the
       MS-DOS and Windows systems. The COMMAND key, which often has
       the picture of the Apple logo and a clover-leaf on it, is
       usually equivalent to the CTRL key on IBM(R) personal
       computers. The OPTION key is sometimes equivalent to the ALT
       key on IBM personal computers. Although the Apple extended
       keyboard contains a set of twelve function keys across the top,
       some earlier Apple keyboards lack these keys. You can emulate
       the function keys through a combination of the CTRL and numeric
       keys. For example, you can use the key combination CTRL+1 in
       place of pressing the F1 key.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       The Apple user interface guidelines define a set of keyboard
       shortcuts that should work the same way in all applications.
       Perhaps the most confusing and seemingly contradictory example
       of this is COMMAND+O. The equivalent key sequence on the MS-DOS
       and Windows platforms, CTRL+O, executes the program or query in
       the active window. On the Macintosh, FoxPro maintains
       consistency with all other standard Macintosh applications by
       invoking the Open File dialog box unless a program or query is
       in the active window, in which case the query or program is
       executed.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. How can I emulate the MS-DOS and Windows ALT key on the
<P><PRE>       Macintosh?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. To emulate the ALT key, press CTRL+OPTION.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. How can I make FoxPro for Macintosh better emulate the way
<P><PRE>       I'm used to navigating, selecting, and using hot keys on the
       MS-DOS and Windows platforms?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. You can set FoxPro for Macintosh to emulate MS-DOS and Windows
       key combinations by using the SET KEYCOMP command. This command
       affects keyboard and menu navigation. The default KEYCOMP
       setting is MAC. For more information about the SET KEYCOMP
       command, see the "Language Reference."
</PRE><P>
</OL>Online Help Differences
 

<OL><P><LI> Q. How can I get online help about FoxPro for Macintosh?
<P>
<P><PRE>    A. There are many ways to access the Microsoft Help system for
       FoxPro for Macintosh. You can press the F1 key, type HELP in
       the Command window and press the RETURN key, or choose
       Microsoft FoxPro Help from the balloon menu in the upper-right
       corner of the system menu bar.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       In addition to the Microsoft Help system, FoxPro also takes
       advantage of Balloon Help(TM), a System 7 feature that supplies
       information about screen objects. When Balloon Help is active,
       a cartoon-like caption bubble or balloon appears, containing
       information about the object to which you are pointing. To
       activate or deactivate the display of balloons, choose Show
       Balloons or Hide Balloons from the Help menu. Balloon Help is
       an aid for learning about the various interface features in the
       Macintosh environment. You may find it useful as you learn
       about the various user-interface objects in the Macintosh
       graphical environment.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. FoxPro for Macintosh includes a Windows-style help system.
<P><PRE>       Is there any way to access the .DBF-style help system I used in
       FoxPro for MS-DOS?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. By default, FoxPro for Macintosh uses the Windows-style help
       system. To access the .DBF-style help system, issue the
       following command:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>          SET HELP TO FOXHELP.DBF

       Press the F1 key or choose Contents from the Help menu to open
       the .DBF-style help system.

       To return to the Windows-style help system, issue the following
       command:

          SET HELP TO FOXHELP.HLP

       To change the default help system to the .DBF-style help
       system, add the following statement to your CONFIG.FPM file:

          HELP = FOXHELP.DBF
