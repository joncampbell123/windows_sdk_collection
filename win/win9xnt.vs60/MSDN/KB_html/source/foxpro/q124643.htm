<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article gives a method you can use to simulate client-server
applications by using Apple Events and FoxPro for Macintosh. With Visual
FoxPro for Macintosh, you can also use this method to communicate to a
Visual FoxPro Executable (.EXE.)
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
FoxPro's ability to run AppleScripts permits developers to build a
client-server application using FoxPro on both sides. Though FoxPro was not
designed to act as a server, and therefore will not behave as a true client-
server system would, it may be acceptable under certain circumstances such
as with a small network that has few users logged in simultaneously.

<OL><P><LI>Users of the application will have to be able to link to programs
   running on the computer that will run the server portion of the
   application. This can be achieved in one of the following two ways:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Users connecting to the Macintosh with FoxPro have to be listed in
      the "Users &amp; Groups" control panel and have File Sharing and Program
      Linking enabled.
</PRE><P>
   -or-
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Users can connect as "Guest". In this case, the &lt;Guest&gt; account in
      the "Users &amp; Groups" control panel has to have File Sharing and
      Program Linking enabled.
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: File Sharing and Program Linking have to be enabled in the Sharing
   Setup control panel for guests or registered users to be able to
   connect, regardless of the settings in the Users &amp; Groups control panel.
   Also, the FoxPro folder and any other appropriate folders must be marked
   as shared by choosing the Sharing... command from the File menu.

<P><LI>The server portion of the application will be Microsoft FoxPro and must
   run on the server Macintosh. If it is not running, the following message
   is displayed:
<P>
   Microsoft FoxPro isn't running
   or program linking isn't enabled.
<PRE>             &lt;Stop&gt;

</PRE><P><LI>The client portion of the application will run on each workstation.
   It can run from a shared network folder to save disk space. The client
   portion runs scripts, created with Apple Script, that use this syntax:
<P>
   tell application "Microsoft FoxPro" of machine "server" of zone "&lt;zone&gt;"
<P><PRE>      do script "&lt;script commands&gt;"
</PRE>   end tell
<P>
   For example, use the following syntax to open a Browse window with the
   customer table (.DBF file). Then perform a join SQL-Select query from
   customer and invoices on the TEST server from the Zone1 zone:
<P>
   tell application "Microsoft FoxPro" of machine "TEST" of zone "ZONE1"
<P><PRE>      open "customer.dbf"
      do script "select * from customer, invoices where
<PRE></PRE>         customer.cno==invoices.cno into table results.dbf"
   end tell

   To create Apple Scripts, use Script Editor, which is located by
   default in the "HD:Apple Extras:AppleScript" folder.

   NOTE: Apple Script and Script Editor are manufactured by Apple, a vendor
   independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise,
   regarding these products' performance or reliability.

   For more information on using AppleScript and Script Editor, see your
   Macintosh documentation.

</PRE><P><LI>The first time the connection is established, the application user is
   prompted to log in to the server computer by a dialog similar to this:
<P>
   Connect to the file server "&lt;server&gt;" as:
<P>
   ( ) Guest
   (o) Registered User
<P>
   Name:
   Password:
<P>
<PRE>        &lt;Cancel&gt;     &lt;OK&gt;

   The user should make the appropriate selection based on the
   configuration chosen in step 1.
