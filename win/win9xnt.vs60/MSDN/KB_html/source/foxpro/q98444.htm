<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The command SET ESCAPE OFF does not disable the ESC key.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
SET ESCAPE OFF keeps the user from interrupting executing lines of code by
pressing the ESC key; however, SET ESCAPE OFF will not prevent a user from
escaping from an active READ. The reason is that a READ, unlike most
commands, creates a wait state; that is, it begins a period of waiting
(often for input) that continues. Since the READ instruction may not finish
for some time, keyboard input, including the ESC key, is interpreted by the
READ, not by SET ESCAPE OFF, which cannot trap the ESC key in the middle of
an executing instruction; therefore, the READ reacts to the ESC key (and
often this means a screen with active GETs is terminated).
<P>
If the ESC key is pressed while non-wait-state lines of code are executing,
the ESC key will be buffered temporarily until the current instruction
finishes, and then the ESC key will be trapped as expected, permitting
continued program execution.
<P>
The SET ESCAPE command determines whether FoxPro will interrupt executing
code when the ESC key is pressed. If SET ESCAPE is ON and code is being
executed, FoxPro will display the "*** INTERRUPTED ***" error message. If
SET ESCAPE is OFF, the program will not be halted. If a READ is in effect
and the program is sitting idle at that READ when the ESC key is pressed,
the READ will be terminated regardless of the setting of ESCAPE and no
message will appear.
<P>
To disable the ESC key, issue the following command:
<P>
<PRE>   ON KEY LABEL ESC *

</PRE>This command completely disables the ESC key until ON KEY LABEL ESC is
issued. To disable any other key, substitute the appropriate key name
for ESC in the above command.
<P>
NOTE: If you have saved the environment with the screen or are opening a
view, the SET ESCAPE OFF and ON KEY LABEL ESC * commands may not work as
expected if the environment or view had different settings for these
commands. To work around this, you can explicitly enter these commands in
the Command window before saving the environment or view. An alternative
workaround regarding the environment is to not save the environment with
the screen; instead use code to explicitly create the environment.
