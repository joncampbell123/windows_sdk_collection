The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0 and 3.0b
<LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, version 2.6
<LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, version 2.6
<LI>Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Attempting to run an executable created with FoxPro 2.x or Visual FoxPro
3.0, which reads a table or .dbf file with an index, results in this error:
<P>
<PRE>   Error 1915 - Collating Sequence "&lt;name&gt;" is not found.

</PRE>In an .exe file created FoxPro for the Mac 2.x and Visual FoxPro 3.0 for
the Macintosh, the following command can trigger the same error.
<P>
<PRE>   SET COLLATE TO "General"

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The executable is not reading the Foxpro.int file at startup, and the
application is attempting to use a table or .dbf file that has an index
with a collating sequence and code page combination that is not internally
supported.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Place the Foxpro.int file in the same directory as the .esl file;
otherwise, error 1915 is generated each time a FoxPro executable uses a
table or .dbf file that contains an index with a Collating Sequence and
Code Page combination that is not internally supported.
<P>
Perform one of the following options to get the Foxpro.int file into the
directory with the .esl file.
<P>
<P><h3>Option One (recommended)</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Include the Foxpro.int file in the application's distribution directory.

<P><LI>When using FoxPro 2.x, make sure that the Foxpro.int file gets placed in
   the directory where the .esl file is located. When using Visual FoxPro's
   Setup Wizard to generate distribution disks (during "Step 6 - File
   Summary"), change the TARGET DIR property for the Foxpro.int file from
   AppDir to WinSysDir.
<P>
</OL><h3>Option Two</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Include the Foxpro.int file in the application distribution directory.

<P><LI>Create a batch file to copy the Foxpro.int file from the application
   directory to the .esl file's directory, and include the batch file in
   the application distribution directory.

<P><LI>In the Setup Wizard, Step 4 - Setup Options, change the POST-SETUP
   EXECUTABLE entry to the name of the batch file.
<P>
</OL><h3>Option Three</h3>
 
<P>
Manually copy the Foxpro.int file to the directory where the .esl file is.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 
<P>
The following steps create a table or .dbf file that has an index with a
collating sequence and code page combination that is not internally
supported in FoxPro.
<P>
NOTE: The following steps are performed within Microsoft Visual FoxPro for
Windows, version 3.0, Professional Edition and the Foxpro.int file must not
be in the Windows\System directory.

<OL><P><LI>Modify the Visual FoxPro for Windows Config.fpw file to include the
   following line:
<P>
<P><PRE>      CODEPAGE=AUTO
</PRE>
<P><LI>Start Visual FoxPro for Windows. If Visual FoxPro for Windows was
   already running when the change to the Config.fpw file in step 1 was
   made, you will need to restart Visual FoxPro for the change to take
   affect.

<P><LI>To set collate to general, type the following command in the Command
   window:
<P>
<P><PRE>      SET COLLATE TO "GENERAL"
</PRE>
<P><LI>Create a new table or .dbf file, and name it Cp850.dbf.

<P><LI>Add two fields named LASTNAME and FIRSTNAME as Character type. Close the
   Table Designer, and save the changes.

<P><LI>To create an index and close the open table, type the following commands
   in the Command window:
<P>
<P><PRE>      INDEX ON LASTNAME TAG LASTNAME
      USE
</PRE>
<P><LI>To set the code page, type the following command in the Command window:
<P>
<P><PRE>      DO \VFP\TOOLS\CPZERO\CPZERO with "CP850.DBF", 850
</PRE>
<P><LI>Create an Executable to browse the CP850 table.

<P><LI>Run the Executable outside of Visual FoxPro. The following error
   (Error 1915) occurs when the Table is opened:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Collating Sequence "General" is not found.
