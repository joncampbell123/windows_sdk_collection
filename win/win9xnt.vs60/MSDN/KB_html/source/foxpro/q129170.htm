The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, version 2.6a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When installing disks created with the Spanish FoxPro for Windows
Distribution Kit (DK), the following error occurs:
<P>
<PRE>   File Copy operation failed - incorrect number of bytes written to disk -
   source file or destination disk may be corrupted - use ChkDsk. Source:
   'A:\OLECLI.DL_'
   Dest: 'C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\OLECLI.DLL'

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This occurs because the compressed English version of the OLECLI.DL_ file
was shipped with the Spanish DK instead of the Spanish version of the
OLECLI.DL_. As a result, there's a difference in the number of bytes in the
file size, which causes the error.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To solve the problem:

<OL><P><LI>Copy the OLECLI.DL_ from the FoxPro for Windows standard product into
   the C:\FPW26\DKSETUP directory, and replace the one that is already
   there. The file size of OLECLI.DL_ should be 41,195.

<P><LI>Delete the DKCONTRL.DBF and DKCONTRL.CDX files.

<P><LI>Rerun the Setup Wizard (the setup wizard will take the new OLECLI.DL_
   file from the dksetup directory and include it for installation).

<P><LI>Rerun INSTALAR.EXE, which is the Spanish SETUP.EXE.
<P>
</OL>Installation will now work correctly.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Observe that in the SETUP.INF file under the [Sysfiles] section:

<OL><P><LI>OLECLI.DLL,,,, 1992-03-10,, 1034, OLDER, !READONLY,,OLECLI.DLL,,,,
   83968, SYSTEM,,, 1.10.0.0, VITAL
<P>
</OL>Notice that the uncompressed size is 83968, which is the same size of the
OLECLI.DLL that ships with the FoxPro for Windows (Spanish) version. Also
observed the following:
<P>
<PRE>                                       Spanish Version     English Version
</PRE></OL> 
Compressed File Size of OLECLI.DLL
<PRE>on Standard Product Disks:             41,195              41,083

</PRE>Compressed File Size of
<PRE>OLECLI.DLL on DK Disks:                41,083              41,083

</PRE>Expanded File Size of OLECLI.DLL on
<PRE>Standard Product after installation:   83,968              83,456


</PRE>The compressed file size of OLECLI.DLL on the standard product disks should
be the same size as the compressed file size of the OLECLI.DLL on the
distribution disks; however, this is inconsistent between the Spanish
Standard Product and the Spanish DK.
<P>
Steps to Reproduce Behavior
 

<OL><P><LI>Create a set of disk images with the Spanish DK.

<P><LI>Execute INSTALAR.EXE form the disk images.

<P><LI>Answer yes to replace the OLECLI.DLL.
<P>
</OL>The error will now be displayed.
