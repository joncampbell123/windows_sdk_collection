<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run (or attempt to modify after running) a Form that was created
with the Form Builder, the following error message appears:
<P>
<PRE>   This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down.

</PRE>Select Details to reveal the following error:
<P>
<PRE>   VFP caused a stack fault in module VFP.EXE ...

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
One of the labels that was added by the Form Builder was modified so that
both the AutoSize and WordWrap properties are .T. (True).
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>

properties on a label added by the Form Builder, right-click the Visible
property of the label and click "Reset to Default."
<P>
If you already ran the form and received the problem described in the
Symptoms section, type the following commands in the command window to
correct the form so that you can modify it and run it in the future:
<P>
NOTE: Spacing and case are important in the REPLACE command.
<P>
<PRE>   scxfile = GETFILE('SCX', 'Locate your form')
   USE (scxfile)
   REPLACE ALL properties WITH ;
     STRTRAN(properties, "Visible = .T."+CHR(13)+CHR(10)) ;
     FOR "label" $ baseclass
   USE

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>

in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
