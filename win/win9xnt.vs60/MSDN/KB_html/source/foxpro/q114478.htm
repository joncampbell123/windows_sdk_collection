<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The information below describes the Label Wizard and how to use it to
create a label.
<P>
This information is also found in FoxPro online Help in the "Label Wizard"
topic.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Label Wizard sets up information in your tables to be printed out in
label form. You can choose a variety of Avery label types in English or
Metric label sizes.
<P>
<P><h3>LABEL WIZARD STEPS</h3>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Step 1 of 5: Selecting a Table</h3>
 
<P>
NOTE: This step is skipped if you start the wizard from the Catalog
Manager, and a table is already in use.
<P>
First select the table you want to use. The list contains the tables that
were open when you started the wizard. If you want to use a table that is
not currently open, choose the Open... button.
<P>
<P><h3>Step 2 of 5: Selecting a Label Type</h3>
 
<P>
First, select the English or Metric option, then select the label
dimensions and number of columns you want to use. If you need to adjust
your printer settings to accommodate the label size you select, choose the
Print Setup... button.
<P>
<P><h3>Step 3 of 5: Setting up the Label</h3>
 
<P>
Select the fields in the order you want them to appear on the label. Either
double-click the field name, or select the field name and choose the &gt;
button.
<P>
Choose the New Line button to start a new line.
<P>
To place more than one field on the same line: Add the first field, then
choose the Space button, or one of the punctuation buttons, then add the
next field.
<P>
FoxPro for Windows: The picture in the wizard window shows approximately
how your label will look. Check this picture to see if the fields you have
chosen will fit on the label. The text lines will extend beyond the bottom
edge of the label if there are too many lines; red arrows will display to
warn you if the text extends beyond the right margin of the label.
<P>
Step 4 of 5: Setting the Sort Order for Records
 
<P>
NOTE: This step will be skipped if you are basing your label on a query.
<P>
Select up to three fields from the Available Fields list to set the sort
order for your labels.
<P>
For example, if you choose Customer.state and Customer.zip, the labels will
be sorted by state, and then by zip code within each state.
<P>
Choose the Ascending option to sort records from the beginning of the
alphabet, the lowest number, or the earliest date; choose the Descending
option to sort records from the end of the alphabet, the highest number, or
the latest date.
<P>
<P><h3>Step 5 of 5: Previewing, Saving, Modifying, and Printing the Labels</h3>
 
<P>
First, choose the Preview... button to see your labels in a preview window.
If you are satisfied with the results, select one of the following options,
then choose the Finish button.

<UL><LI>Save Label for Later Use creates a Microsoft FoxPro label (.LBX) file
   which you can later use to generate and run your labels.

<LI>Save and Print Label displays the Save As dialog so you can save the
   labels, then displays the Print dialog so you can select print options
   and send the labels to a printer.

<LI>Modify Label with Design Tool saves the label and displays the label
   format in the Report Layout window, so you can modify it as needed.
