<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
A "Too many files open" error occurs.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
On both the server and workstation computers, do the following to address
this situation:

<OL><P><LI>Check the FILES statement in the CONFIG.SYS file to ensure that it does
   not contain any spaces and that there are enough files specified
   (FILES=60 is a good starting point).

<P><LI>In a Novell network environment, check the FILE HANDLES statement in
   either the SHELL.CFG or the NET.CFG, depending on your installation (for
   example, FILE HANDLES=80).
<P>
<P><PRE>      NOTE: The location of the SHELL or NET.CFG file is critical in a
      network environment. The file MUST be in the same directory as the
      IPXODI driver. If it is NOT in the same directory, the FILE HANDLES
      statement will NOT be processed. Novell governs the number of files
      open by the FILE HANDLES statement independently of the MS-DOS FILES
      statement. A FILES setting of 100 is usually more than adequate, but
      in any case, the combination of the FILES statement AND the FILE
      HANDLES statement in the *.CFG file should NOT exceed the MS-DOS
      limit of 255. The combination of the two values is cumulative.
</PRE><P>
<P>
   This error may also occur when running the Microsoft Client software for
   Netware, under Windows 95. This occurs because this client software does
   not support Novell's Network Directory Services. In order to get support
   for these services, download MSNDS.EXE from one of Microsoft's on-line
   resources. For more information about Microsoft Services for Netware
   Directory Services, please see the following article in the Microsoft
   Knowledge base:

<PRE>   TITLE     : Microsoft Service for Netware Directory Services Available

</PRE><P><LI>If the AUTOEXEC.BAT file loads the MS-DOS SHARE utility, modify the F
   and L parameters to specify a greater number of files and locks (for
   example, SHARE /F:5120 /L:500).
<P>
   /F: Allocates file space for the MS-DOS storage area used to record
   file-sharing information. The default value is 2040.
<P>
   /L: Sets the number of files that can be locked at one time. The default
   value is 20.
<P>
   NOTE: By using the MS-DOS INSTALL command, SHARE may be loaded in the
   CONFIG.SYS file instead of AUTOEXEC.BAT. Be sure to check both files to
   determine if SHARE has been loaded.

<P><LI>If the system has less than 4 megabytes of random-access memory (RAM),
   try remarking out the disk cache. To do this for SMARTDRV.EXE, place
   "REM " (without the quotation marks) in front of the line that loads
   SMARTDRV.EXE in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file.
