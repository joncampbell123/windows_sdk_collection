The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you save a report while some of the report's objects are selected,
the following unexpected behavior occurs:

<UL><LI>To clear the selection of the objects that were selected before the
   report was saved, you need to click them directly. After clearing the
   selection, you can't select these objects if click them directly, but
   they are selected if you click any other object in the report.

<LI>If you click Select All on the Edit menu, all the objects will be
   selected except the objects that were selected before the report was
   saved.

<LI>If you click a blank area of the report to clear a selection of Report
   objects that were selected by clicking Select All, then the objects that
   were selected before the report was saved are erroneously selected.
<P>
</UL><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
You can use one of the following methods to correct this problem:

<UL><LI>Double-click the bar of any of the report bands.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Increase or decrease the height of any of the report bands by clicking a
   band's bar and then dragging it up or down.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Close the report, and then reopen it.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem has been fixed in
Visual FoxPro 5.0 for Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Modify any Report.

<P><LI>Select any object in the report, and move it slightly.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Save to save the report.

<P><LI>Select any other object in the report. You will see that the object
   selected in step 2 stays selected along with the new object that you
   just selected.

<P><LI>On the Edit menu, click Select All. Note that all the report objects are
   selected except for the one selected in step 2.

<P><LI>Click a blank area of the report. This should clear all selections, but
   it does not. The objects selected in step 2 are erroneously selected.
