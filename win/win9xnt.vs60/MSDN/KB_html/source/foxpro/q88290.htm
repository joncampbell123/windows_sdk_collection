The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS, version 2.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The "Cannot load PROAPI16.EXE" error message is displayed when you use
the Extended (32-bit) version of FoxPro for MS-DOS.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
There are three main causes of this error:

<OL><P><LI>The PROAPI16.EXE file is not in a directory listed in the AUTOEXEC.BAT
   PATH environment variable.

<P><LI>The CONFIG.FP file contains the DOSMEM=ON statement.

<P><LI>There is not enough free conventional memory available on the system.
<P>
</OL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
The corresponding resolutions for the causes above are as follows:

<OL><P><LI>Make sure that the directory containing the PROAPI16.EXE file is
   listed in the PATH environment variable in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

<P><LI>Modify the CONFIG.FP file to include the DOSMEM=OFF statement, or
   comment out the DOSMEM=ON statement in the CONFIG.FP file.

<P><LI>Modify the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files to free as much
   conventional memory as possible.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
PROAPI16.EXE is a memory manager used only in the Extended version of
FoxPro version 2.0. It loads into the lower 640K of RAM to make conversions
between 16-bit application programming interface (API) libraries, BIN
routines, and the 32-bit Extended version of FoxPro.
<P>
In the Extended version of FoxPro, DOSMEM=ON causes all available
conventional memory to be used as additional extended memory. Since
the 16-bit API uses conventional memory to perform its 32-bit to 16-bit
translation, DOSMEM=ON prevents the API from being loaded.
<P>
If an application for the Extended version of FoxPro uses an API function,
the PROAPI16.EXE file must be distributed with the application. For
example, when printer drivers are included in an application, the GENPD.APP
file must be included in the project and marked as Excluded.
<P>
GENPD.APP contains library files that can be loaded only into conventional
memory. When FoxPro runs in Extended (32-bit) mode, PROAPI16.EXE provides a
way to access these library files. Because the Standard version of FoxPro
runs in 16-bit mode, it does not require any conversions; thus, the
PROAPI16.EXE file is not required.
