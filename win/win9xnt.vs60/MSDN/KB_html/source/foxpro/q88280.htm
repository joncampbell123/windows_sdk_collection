The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS, version 2.0
</UL> 
<P>
In the FoxPro "Commands and Functions" manual, the first two paragraphs
in the documentation for the SET EXACT command contain two errors.
<P>
The sentence that describes when EXACT is OFF reads as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   If two strings match up to the point where one or the other is
   exhausted, then they are considered equal.

</PRE>This sentence is incorrect; it should read as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   If the strings match up to the point where the second string
   becomes exhausted, they are considered equal.

</PRE>The sentence that describes when EXACT is ON reads as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   Strings must match character for character and be of the same
   length to be considered equal.

</PRE>This sentence is incorrect; it should read as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   Strings must match character for character and be of the same
   length, however strings with different numbers of trailing blanks
   will be considered equal.

   For example: "HI = "HI " is .T. and "HI " = "HI" is .T. with EXACT
   SET ON.

</PRE>The SET EXACT values are explained correctly in the second paragraph
of the "String Comparisons" section and in the examples in that
section.
