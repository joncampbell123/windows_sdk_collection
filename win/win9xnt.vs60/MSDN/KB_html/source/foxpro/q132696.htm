The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS, versions 2.5, 2.5a, 2.5b, 2.6, 2.6a
<LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5, 2.5a, 2.5b, 2.6, 2.6a
</UL>

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Running an .EXE file on the development machine works, but when that .EXE
file is moved out of the development directory or onto another machine, the
customer encounters the error "File &lt;filename&gt; does not exist." While
investigating the error, it is found that the file was never brought into
the project by the Project Manager, so file is missing from the .EXE file.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
In any case where macro substitution is used in a command expression that
makes a call to another file, the Project Manager skips over that line
without adding the file to the Project.
<P>
For an example, consider the REPORT FORM command. Developers who offer
destination options (to print, preview, and so on) often store those
options to variables that are then referenced in the REPORT FORM expression
by using macro substitution. Here s an example:
<P>
<PRE>   output="preview"
   REPORT FORM customer &amp;output

</PRE>In spite of the fact that macro substitution is not used to reference the
REPORT FORM file directly, having it any place in the expression causes
the Project Manager to skip the line and not automatically bring the report
file into the project during a project build. Therefore the file is missing
from the .EXE file.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Use either of these resolutions:

<UL><LI>Do not use macro substitution in a command expression that makes
   reference to a file that exists at some place within one of the project
   files.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Add the file to the project manually.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 
<P>
Using the Customer database in the Tutorial subdirectory of the main FoxPro
directory, build a report named Customer. Create a .PRG file named Test
containing the following code:
<P>
<PRE>   output="preview"
   REPORT FORM customer &amp;output

</PRE>Create a new project and add the Test.prg program to it. Build the project.
Note that the Customer report form is not brought into the project. If this
project is later built into an .EXE and all required support files are
distributed (ESL, DBF, and so on), the customer can encounter this error:
<P>
<PRE>   File Customer.frx Does Not Exist
</PRE>
