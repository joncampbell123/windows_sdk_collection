<P>
<P><h3>Invisible Buttons in Screens</h3>
 
<P>
Invisible buttons are a type of push button and can be created using the
push button tool in the Screen Builder toolbox.
<P>
<P><h3>Pictures Buttons in Screens</h3>
 
<P>
You can create picture screen controls such as push buttons, check boxes
and radio buttons using the SHOW GET command. In addition, you can specify
a separate .BMP file for each of the three states in which a control can
exist (enabled, selected, disable) as shown in this example:
<P>
<PRE>   SHOW GET mybtn,7  PROMPT 'EXITEN.BMP,EXITSEL.BMP,EXITDIS.BMP'

</PRE><h3>Automatic Color for Screen Objects</h3>
 
<P>
If you intend to allow users to set their own colors in applications, make
sure that screen objects use the Automatic color setting from the Screen
menu color palettes.
<P>
<P><h3>Bitmaps for Screen Controls</h3>
 
<P>
When using bitmaps in a set of controls, try to use bitmaps that are the
same size. You should also use bitmaps that have a white (distinguishing)
background so that when you disable them, they will have a well defined
outline. Try to use a bitmap that is slightly smaller than the overall
control because extra border space is added automatically.
<P>
Three-Dimensional Screens
 
<P>
You can create dialogs which appear three-dimensional, making objects look
like they are recessed into the screen. To create this effect, change the
color of the screen to light gray. Next, use the line tool to make a box
for the area you want to recede or bring out. Finally, change the pen color
of one set of adjacent lines to white and the other to black. Coloring the
top line white makes the screen section appear to come out at you. Using
white on the bottom gives a recessed appearance. Try to use a small pen
size for the best effect.
<P>
<P><h3>Spinner Limits</h3>
 
<P>
When creating spinners, remember that the minimum and maximum settings do
not stop a user from typing in any value they desire. You must specify
range values to limit the values that users can type.
<P>
<P><h3>Override Snap to Grid</h3>
 
<P>
The Snap To Grid option in the Screen Builder allows you to align objects
to a grid defined in the Ruler/Grid dialog. To override the Snap To Grid
setting, hold down the CTRL key when moving an object. If you are not sure
whether objects are aligned, use the line tool to create a temporary line
for alignment purposes. Also, you can use the Show Position menu option to
display the exact coordinates of an object in the status bar.
<P>
<P><h3>Single Platform Screens</h3>
 
<P>
If you are generating screens for use in Windows only, make sure you have
the Window Objects Only option checked in the Generate Screen dialog. This
will reduce the amount of code generated and the time it takes to generate
code.
<P>
<P><h3>Transparent/Opaque Screen Objects</h3>
 
<P>
The Screen Builder allows you to apply a Mode attribute to certain objects
such as text. The Mode attribute can be opaque or transparent. A text
object's fill colors only appear if the object is opaque. Avoid using a
transparent mode on @ ... SAYs which are refreshed with different text.
This will cause the old text to be overwritten on top by the new text.
<P>
Since new objects can overwrite old objects, you may not see the desired
effect when creating transparent objects that toggle between enabled and
disabled states. You can, however, attain some interesting and desired
special effects using a transparent mode. For example, a disabled control
such as a check box dims the text prompt as well as the box portion of the
control. You can make the text prompt appear enabled even though the check
box is actually disabled. You simply need to ENABLE and then DISABLE the
control using the SHOW GET command.
<P>
The SET INTENSITY command can be used to control the background appearance
of the @ ... GET fields.
<P>
<P><h3>Read-Only Edit Regions in Screens</h3>
 
<P>
The @ ... EDIT command is used to create edit regions for memo fields on
screens. The Screen Builder does not have an option to make these read-
only. You can create a work around solution by defining the WHEN clause of
the edit region as an expression and typing in the following code:
<P>
<PRE>   .T. NOMODIFY

</PRE><h3>Quick Screen</h3>
 
<P>
If you create a Quick Screen and you specify a column layout but only get
one column, one or more of your fields may be too wide for multiple
columns. Adjust the maximum field width in the Quick Screen dialog and try
again.
<P>
<P><h3>Hot Keys in Screens</h3>
 
<P>
In FoxPro for Windows, screen objects are assigned default hot keys. These
hot keys can be chosen by pressing ALT+key. This is standard in Microsoft
Windows applications.
<P>
<P><h3>Templates for Screens and Reports</h3>
 
<P>
If you usually use settings in the Screen Builder or Report Writer that are
not the default (ruler settings, show position, and so on), consider
creating a template with your custom settings and using the template as the
base for new screens or reports.
<P>
<P><h3>Circles in Screens and Reports</h3>
 
<P>
To create a circle (oval) in the Screen Builder or Report Writer, use the
rounded-rectangle tool to create the object, then double-click on it and
select the round button.
<P>
<P><h3>Size Report and Screen Fields</h3>
 
<P>
To easily size fields one character at a time, use FONTMETRIC(7) to
determine the maximum character width for the font you're using then set
the horizontal grid to the maximum character width. When you size fields,
they will move one "character" at a time.
<P>
Drawing Multiple Objects in Screens and Reports
 
<P>
In the Screen Builder and Report Writer, after you select a tool from the
toolbox and draw an object, the selection pointer becomes the active tool.
To keep another tool active when drawing multiple objects of the same type,
double-click the tool. It will appear darkened when it is selected in this
manner.
<P>
<P><h3>Special Characters in Reports and Screens</h3>
 
<P>
When you add text to a screen or report, you can use any character in the
current font, even those characters you can't directly type on the
keyboard. To enter special characters, hold down the ALT key and type in
the number of the character using the numeric keypad. For example, in ANSI-
standard fonts, character number 0169 is the copyright symbol. Character
number 0174 is the trademark symbol. Release the ALT key to display the
symbol.
<P>
<P><h3>Placing Objects in Screens and Reports</h3>
 
<P>
In FoxPro for Windows, the keyboard is the best device to use to precisely
place objects. When an object is selected, you can use the arrow keys to
move it 1 pixel at a time. Holding down the SHIFT key while you use the
arrow keys will resize the object.
<P>
<P><h3>Multi-Line Text Objects</h3>
 
<P>
You can create multi-line text objects in the Screen Builder and Report
Writer by pressing ENTER to continue typing on the next line. You are
limited to 255 characters per text object.
<P>
<P><h3>Redo Quick Screen/Report/Menu</h3>
 
<P>
To redo a Quick Screen, Report or Menu, delete all of the objects and
choose the Quick Screen/Report/Menu option again.
<P>
<P><h3>Managing Snippets</h3>
 
<P>
Open and minimize any snippets that are complex or that you use regularly
so that when you open the screen or menu, they are easily accessible from
the bottom of the main FoxPro window.
<P>
<P><h3>Multi-Column Snaking Reports</h3>
 
<P>
Because FoxPro for Windows uses the same format for labels as it does for
reports, you can create multi-column snaking reports. In fact, the .FRX and
.LBX files are identical. And the REPORT FORM and LABEL FORM commands are
interchangeable.
<P>
<P><h3>AS Clause in RQBE</h3>
 
<P>
RQBE does not have a built-in way to create an AS clause to rename an
output column. To create an AS clause in RQBE, open the RQBE Select Fields
dialog and type the field name followed by the AS name in the
Functions/Expression box. This is especially handy when using a function:
<P>
<PRE>   COUNT(people.name) AS 'Employees'

</PRE>NOTE: When FoxPro reopens a .QPR file, it will ignore the AS clause. It
still exists in the file until you save over it. This trick can be quite
useful with on-the-fly queries which don't need to be saved.
<P>
<P><h3>Right Margin Settings</h3>
 
<P>
The Right Margin option in the Print Options dialog is not available in
FoxPro for Windows. Instead, use the Print Setup dialog to select the
proper paper size.
