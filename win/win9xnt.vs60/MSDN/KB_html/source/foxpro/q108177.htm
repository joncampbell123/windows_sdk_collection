<P>
 
 
<P><h2>Part 1: Installation</h2>
 
<P>
There are three types of installation for FoxPro for MS-DOS: Normal
Installation, Administrative Installation and Workstation Installation.
Instructions for Normal Installation are in the FoxPro Installation and
Configuration manual. For information about Administrative and Workstation
Installation, see INSTALL.TXT on FoxPro for MS-DOS Disk 1.
 
 
<P><h2>Part 2: WAIT WINDOW Enhancements</h2>
 
<P>
WAIT WINDOW now supports multiple line messages. Use a carriage return
(CHR(13)) to move portions of your message to additional lines. The message
window is automatically expanded to accommodate additional lines. For
example, this command creates a message window that contains two lines:
<P>
WAIT WINDOW "This is the 1st line" + CHR(13) + ;
<PRE>    "This is the 2nd line"

</PRE>The width of the message window is adjusted to fit the longest line in the
message. All lines in the message are left justified in the message window.
Line feeds (CHR(10)) following CHR(13) are ignored.
 
 
<P><h2>Part 3: New Commands and Functions</h2>
 
<P>
Several new commands and functions are added to FoxPro 2.5b. For additional
information about these commands and functions, see the "International and
Cross Platform Recommendations" section below and the corresponding topics
in Help.

<P><h2>Part 4: New Transporter and Screen Directives</h2>
 
<P>
Several new Transporter and screen directives have been added.
<P>
The #DOSOBJ, #MACOBJ, #UNIXOBJ and #WINOBJ Transporter directives allow you
to transport objects created in the Screen Builder and Report Writer to
specific FoxPro platforms. For additional information about these
Transporter directives, see the Transporting Files topic in Help.
<P>
#TRAN SNIPPET ONLY, a new screen directive, is available in FoxPro 2.5b.
This screen directive affects how screen objects are transported, and is
not discussed in Help. #TRAN SNIPPET ONLY is designed to limit the
Transporter's changes to just screen snippets, and is placed in a screen's
Setup snippet.
<P>
When screen objects are transported to a different FoxPro platform, only
the screen snippets for updated screen objects are transported if #TRAN
SNIPPET ONLY is included. All other screen object attributes are not
transported to the different platform.
<P>
Note that #TRAN SNIPPET ONLY only affects updated screen objects; it does
not affect new or unchanged screen objects or screen objects being
transported for the first time.

<P>
FoxPro 2.5b gives international developers and users powerful new features
for handling accented characters across different FoxPro platforms, and
provides accurate sorting in many languages.
<P>
For international FoxPro users, this section describes how code pages and
collation sequences affect sorting, seeking and comparisons using the SORT
and SEEK commands, and also provides recommendations for taking advantage
of these features.
<P>
U.S. FoxPro users whose applications don't contain accented characters may
not need any of the new international 2.5b features. In this case, you can
disregard this section of the README and the International/X-Platform topic
in Help. FoxPro 2.5b is 100% percent compatible with FoxPro 2.5.
<P>
<P><h3>1 FoxPro Collation Sequences</h3>
 
<P>
With a MACHINE collation sequence, which earlier FoxPro versions use (and
to which FoxPro 2.5b still defaults), each character in the code page,
whether it's a Roman character, an accented character, or a line-drawing
character, has a unique "sort weight" determined by its position in the
code page. In a majority of code pages, all accented characters appear
after the unaccented characters. In this situation an "('a' with an
umlaut)" sorts after "z", which isn't correct in most languages (although
it is true in Swedish, for example).
<P>
Furthermore, in most languages accented characters sort after their
unaccented counterparts, but only if the unaccented versions of all
characters being compared are the same. For example, in German, "('a' with
an umlaut)" sorts after the unaccented "a", but the string "('a' with an
umlaut)a" sorts before the string "ab" because the second character "a" is
less than the second character "b". In this way, characters are interleaved
in many cultures.
<P>
FoxPro 2.5b supports a number of new collation sequences to correctly sort
in many languages. These sequences take into account all the complex rules
of the language (including two-to-one, three-to-one and one-to-two
mappings). The following collation sequences were available when this
README was created. The code pages for which these collation sequences are
defined are also included.

</PRE>If you specify a collation sequence in the SET COLLATE command as a string
literal, enclose the collation sequence in quotation marks. Don't enclose
the collation sequence in quotation marks if you specify a collation
sequence in your FoxPro configuration file (CONFIG.FP or CONFIG.FPW).
<P>
If you use the SET COLLATE command to specify a collation sequence that
isn't supported by the current code page, FoxPro generates an error. If you
specify a collation sequence in your FoxPro configuration file that isn't
supported by the current code page, the collation sequence defaults to
MACHINE.
<P>
If you specify a collation sequence in the International panel in the View
window, the collation sequence names appear in longer forms. For example,
the NORDAN option appears as Norwegian &amp; Danish, and the SWEFIN option
appears as Swedish &amp; Finnish.
<P>
For additional information about collation sequences, see SET COLLATE in
Help.
<P>
<P><h3>3 Case-Sensitive Collation Sequences</h3>
 
<P>
Two case-sensitive collation sequences are available in FoxPro: the
familiar MACHINE sequence, the default sequence in earlier FoxPro versions,
and the sequence named UNIQWT. UNIQWT is a "unique weight" sort in which
each accented character sorts strictly after its unaccented counterpart
(unlike the interleaving of accented characters described earlier).
<P>
While the collation sequence with UNIQWT isn't strictly culturally correct
as with GENERAL, it may aid developers in migrating their applications from
earlier FoxPro versions. One reason is that upper- and lower-case letter
are treated distinctly as they were in earlier FoxPro versions. Another
reason is described in the section titled "How do the SEEK and SKIP
commands work?"
<P>
<P><h3>4 How do the SEEK and SKIP commands work?</h3>
 
<P>
The SEEK command accepts an expression. FoxPro transforms that expression
into a sort key which it compares to keys in the master index or tag. SEEK
then positions the record pointer at the first index entry that's greater
than or equal to ( &gt;= ) the supplied key.
<P>
With a machine sort, SEEK finds a match if there is one. The UNIQWT sort
has the same property. But when FoxPro uses the new language-specific
collation sequences to create indexes, only the alphabetic part of the key
is considered and any diacritical marks are ignored. In other words, even
if you SEEK "('a' with an umlaut)bc" you may find "abc". Note that partial
searches (where you search for part of the field) using SEEK may not return
the results you expect when the current collation sequence is not MACHINE
or UNIQWT.
<P>
FoxPro behaves this way for the following three reasons:
<P>
1) Performance.
<P>
2) Consistency with the SKIP command.
<P>
3) Consistency with the SET NEAR command.
<P>
To have SEEK and SKIP find only those records that exactly match accented
characters, you must either SET EXACT ON or use an index tag created with
the MACHINE or UNIQWT collation sequences.
<P>
Note that SEEK and SKIP use the collation sequence of the master index or
tag, and ignore the current collation sequence. SEEK can't be used unless
there is an index is active.
<P>
<P><h3>5 Alternatives to SEEK and SKIP</h3>
 
<P>
If you use accented characters, use one of the following methods to search
a table:
<P>
1) Construct a loop with SCAN FOR ... ENDSCAN.
<P>
2) Use LOCATE FOR ... CONTINUE.
<P>
LOCATE and SCAN use an index if one is active, and they have two very
significant advantages over SEEK when data contains accented characters.
<P>
First, both LOCATE and SCAN remember the condition with which they were
invoked, so they can be used for looping on a condition. SEEK, on the other
hand, simply positions you somewhere in the index, and SKIP continues down
the index from that point. With international data, this may not give you
the results you want.
<P>
Second, LOCATE and SCAN are diacritically-sensitive, whereas SEEK isn't. In
addition, both LOCATE and SCAN can be fully optimized by Rushmore if the
current collation sequence is MACHINE or UNIQWT; otherwise partial
optimization will occur.
<P>
The ORDER BY clause of the SQL SELECT command uses the current collating
sequence, which is returned by SET("COLLATE")).
<P>
<P><h3>6 Additional Recommendations</h3>
 
<P>
1) If you aren't concerned with indexing accented characters in a language-
<PRE>   specific way, feel free to continue to use machine indexes. For many
   U.S. users, this is appropriate.

</PRE>2) For the best performance when using a collation sequence other than
<PRE>   MACHINE or UNIQWT, be sure that the current collation sequence is the
   same as the collation sequence of any indexes you are using.

</PRE>3) Most international users will want accented characters in all fields to
<PRE>   be translated automatically by FoxPro when running cross-platform
   applications. However, if you have a table with a character field that's
   actually storing binary information (data), the SET NOCPTRANS command
   allows you to inform FoxPro that characters in such a field should not
   be translated.

   Binary data might otherwise be changed, because of FoxPro's "nearest"
   character mapping. For characters such as the MS-DOS line-drawing
   characters, FoxPro maps to the "nearest" character in the destination
   code page.

   If you choose to use SET NOCPTRANS, you must do so immediately after
   issuing the USE command. From that point on, FoxPro's automatic
   character translation is not in effect for any fields you designate. In
   particular, you must issue the SET NOCPTRANS command before issuing a
   SQL SELECT command -- you cannot let SQL SELECT open tables for you if
   the tables contain fields which should not be translated.

   Note that SET NOCPTRANS only operates on fields for the table open in
   the currently selected work area. If you close a table and then open
   the table again, you must reissue SET NOCPTRANS and designate the
   fields which should not be translated.

</PRE>4) If you create cross platform applications, you should avoid using
<PRE>   FoxFont. FoxFont is an OEM MS-DOS font that you may find useful in some
   situations. But if you use FoxFont in an application you create in
   FoxPro for Windows, some of the characters in the application may not
   transport correctly to other FoxPro platforms.

   Furthermore, FoxFont won't correctly display characters typed on
   international Windows keyboards. If you have automatic code page
   translation enabled, FoxPro will display accented characters correctly.

   FoxFont is the installed default font for the FoxPro desktop. FoxFont
   is the default font for user-defined windows created with DEFINE WINDOW
   when the FONT clause is omitted. Be sure to include the FONT clause
   when creating user-defined windows in FoxPro for Windows.

   FixedSys is the default font for the Command, Trace and Debug windows
   if you're using Windows 3.1. Text editor windows default to the current
   Command window font.

</PRE>5) FoxPro 2.5b can automatically translate accented characters in most
<PRE>   files types such as .DBF, .SCX, and .FXP files. However, program (.PRG)
   and text (.TXT) files don't have a header and can't be marked with a
   code page. Therefore, FoxPro must assume that a program or text file was
   designed for use on the platform on which it is opened.

   It's important that you compile each program on the platform on which
   it was written. Since compiled programs (.FXP files) have a header,
   once you compile a program, it can be run on any FoxPro platform and
   accented characters in the original source program are automatically
   translated when automatic code page translation is in effect.

</PRE>6) Do not mix programs created on different FoxPro platforms in a project.
<PRE>   The Project Manager assumes that all programs in a project are native to
   the current FoxPro platform. If you create an application or an
   executable from a project that contains programs created on different
   FoxPro platforms, translation of accented characters in the programs
   might not be translated properly.

   Also, within the Project Manager you can't specify the platform on
   which a program or text file was created. Therefore, in the Project
   Manager don't edit programs or tables created on a FoxPro platform
   other than the current platform. This means that you shouldn't double-
   click on a file to open it in the Project Manager if you've enabled
   automatic translation by including CODEPAGE = AUTO in your FoxPro
   configuration file.

   If you create an application that contains files created on different
   FoxPro platforms, do not open the files for editing from within the
   Project Manager.

   However, once you build an application (.APP file), it will run on any
   FoxPro platform and FoxPro can automatically translate accented
   characters.

</PRE>7) If you have a project created in FoxPro for MS-DOS version 2.0 and the
<PRE>   files within the project contain accented characters, you can share the
   project and its files across different FoxPro platforms by performing
   the following steps to convert the project and its files. This
   conversion is required just once, and enables cross platform sharing of
   all the elements of the project.

   a) Open the project in FoxPro for MS-DOS 2.5b or FoxPro for Windows
      2.5b. A dialog appears, asking if you would like to convert the
      project to a 2.5 format. Choose Yes, then close the project.

   b) Open every screen, report, label, menu and table contained in the
      project with the USE command. You are prompted for the code page
      (437, 850 and so on) on which each was created. Specify the MS-DOS
      code page on which each was built and then choose Yes.

   c) Use MODIFY COMMAND or MODIFY FILE and include the AS clause to open
      EVERY program, query, format file or text file contained in the
      project. In the AS clause, specify the code page (437, 850 and so on)
      of the FoxPro platform on which each was created. Choose the Save As
      option from the File menu and choose the Change Code Page check box.
      In the dialog that appears after you choose Save, specify the code
      page for the FoxPro platform on which the file will be used.

</PRE>8) If you're developing a cross-platform application, avoid using
<PRE>   characters that appear in one code page and not another. For example,
   the MS-DOS line drawing characters aren't supported under Windows, so
   avoid using them in screens you plan to transport between FoxPro for MS-
   DOS and FoxPro for Windows.

   You can use CHR() if your application absolutely requires line drawing
   and accented characters. Output from CHR() isn't translated when the
   function is executed, allowing you to output any character.

</PRE>9) The MS-DOS file system is case-insensitive and requires uppercase file
<PRE>   names. If your applications run on FoxPro for MS-DOS, be sure to
   restrict file names to those characters that have uppercase equivalents
   in your MS-DOS code page.

   For example, code page 437 doesn't contain uppercase versions of
   several accented vowels. These characters can't be safely used in a
   FoxPro file name. It's best to avoid accented characters in file names.

<P>
If you accidentally specify the wrong code page when you open a table that
isn't marked with a code page, run CPZERO.PRG to reset the table's code
page to zero. CPZERO is a FoxPro program that is automatically installed in
your FoxPro directory. Before you run CPZERO, make sure that the table
whose code page you'll reset isn't open. When you run CPZERO, you are
prompted for the name of the table to modify.

This help file topic contains the following line:
<P>
For example, if the current collation sequence is GENERAL, both of these
return true (.T.):
<P>
<PRE>   "Stra('a' with an acute accent)e" = "Strasse"

   and

   "Stra('a' with an acute accent)e" == "Strasse"

</PRE>"Stra('a' with an acute accent)e" == "Strasse" will always return .F., not
.T. as it states in this topic. A strict machine comparison is performed by
