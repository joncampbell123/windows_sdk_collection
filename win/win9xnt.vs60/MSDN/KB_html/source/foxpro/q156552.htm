<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
With the introduction of Offline Views, Visual FoxPro has brought together
tables and views in a different way. This article explains these
differences and new functionality.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Offline views are actually a table and view depending on which clause you
use with the USE command (USE, USE ADMIN, or USE ONLINE).
<P>
When you create an offline view with the CREATEOFFLINE command, it is
possible to have five new files that belong to the offline view (not
counting the database's .dbc file).
<P>
<P><h3>Example 1</h3>
 
<P>
The table that the view is built from does not contain a MEMO or GENERAL
field:
<P>
<PRE>   CREATEOFFLINE('view1')

</PRE>The view1.dbf, view1.tbf, and view1.tdx files are created.
<P>
<P><h3>Example 2</h3>
 
<P>
The table that the view is built from does contain a MEMO or GENERAL field:
<P>
<PRE>   CREATEOFFLINE('view1')

</PRE>The view1.dbf, view1.tbf, view1.tdx, view1.tpt, and view1.fpt files are
created.
<P>
The USE command by itself with the offline view actually uses a table(for
example, view1.dbf) that was created from the CREATEOFFLINE command. Even
though users are using a table, they can only set the BUFFERING mode to
OPTIMISTIC ROW or OPTIMISTIC TABLE buffering. In this mode the users are
also allowed to place a INDEX on the offline view. Once the offline view is
used ONLINE or in ADMIN mode, the index is dropped and a new one has to be
created the next time the users use the offline view with the USE command.
<P>
When the users use the ADMIN or ONLINE clause with the USE command, they
are now using a view. While using the offline view with either of these two
clauses, the users are not allowed to change the BUFFERING mode or to place
a INDEX on the offline view. The ADMIN clause does not try to reestablish a
link back to the server, while the ONLINE clause does.
<P>
Offline views are allowed to have Relations (SET RELATION TO), but they
cannot be used with referential integrity. Other commands that cannot be
used with offline views are PACK, ZAP, MODIFY, and REQUERY.
<P>
If you are taking the offline view away from the database, you should copy
all the files mentioned above along with the database's .dbc file.
