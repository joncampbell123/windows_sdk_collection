<P>
When you try to close a table (.dbf) file located on a CD-ROM that is not
marked as read-only and also contains international characters, you may
receive this error:
<P>
<PRE>   Not enough diskspace.

</PRE>In Visual FoxPro for Macintosh the program may fail with the following
message:
<P>
<PRE>   The application Visual FoxPro for Macintosh has unexpectedly quit,
   because an error of type 3 occurred. You should save your work in
   other open applications and restart the computer.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The table is located on a CD-ROM and the file is not marked as read-only.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Add the NOUPDATE clause to the USE command that opens the table.
<P>
NOTE: Selecting the "Open As Read-Only" check box adds the NOUPDATE clause
to the USE command that is then executed.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Burn a custom CD-ROM to include a table file that meets the following
   conditions:
<P>
   - Table contains either a character field with international extended
<P><PRE>     characters (such as an umlaut) or contains a standard memo field with
     international extended characters.
</PRE><P>
   - Table codepage is marked as 0, which means that the table was saved
<P><PRE>     without a codepage tag.
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: FoxPro program Cpzero.prg will cause this error to occur.
<P>
   - Table is burned onto a CD-ROM without having its file attribute marked
<P><PRE>     as read only.
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: Most CD-ROM software sets the read-only attribute by default and
   there may not be an option to change this behavior.

<P><LI>Add the following environment settings in the Config.fpw:
<P>
<PRE>      CODEPAGE = AUTO    &amp;&amp; Without this setting problem will not occur.
      EXCLUSIVE = ON

</PRE><P><LI>Open the table.

<P><LI>An informational dialog is displayed entitled "Code Page" that
   contains the following message:
<P>
<P><PRE>      File &lt;filename.dbf&gt; is not marked with a code page. Please select the
      code page it was created in.
</PRE><P>
   By default the Platform option button is set to All and the Code Page
   list box is set to 1252 - Windows ANSI. Click the Select button.

<P><LI>Close the table with the following FoxPro command:
<P>
<P><PRE>      USE
</PRE><P>
   The error message below is displayed:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Not enough diskspace.
</PRE><P>
</OL>NOTE: This same test can be performed on a write-protected floppy disk.
However, the error message is worded differently depending on the operating
system being used.
<P>
On Windows NT 4.0 the following error messages appear, but on Windows 95
only the second error message appears.
<P>
<PRE>   Vfp.exe -  Write Protect Error
   The disk cannot be written to because it is write protected. Please
   Remove the write protection from the volume in Drive A:

      [Abort]  [Retry]  [Ignore]

   Selection of the [Abort] or [Ignore] button generates the error dialog
   box:

      Microsoft Visual FoxPro
      Error writing to file.

         [OK] [Help]
