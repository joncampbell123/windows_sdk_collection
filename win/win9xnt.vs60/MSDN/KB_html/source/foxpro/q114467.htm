The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
One of the following error message is displayed when you attempt to save a
table that was created with the Table Wizard:
<P>
FoxPro 2.x:
<P>
<PRE>   Line Number:  298
   Program:      MAKETABLE
   Error:        Not enough disk space for &lt;file name&gt;
   Source:       index on &amp;tagexpr tag &amp;tagname

 -or-

</PRE>Visual FoxPro for Windows:
<P>
<PRE>   Error #56 in processoutput(0): Not enough disk space for &lt;file_name&gt;

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The media on which the table is being saved does not have sufficient space
to hold the .CDX file for the table.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Before saving a table created with the Table Wizard, make sure that the
location to which the file will be saved has sufficient space to
accommodate both the .DBF file and the .CDX file. For most applications, 5K
of free space should be sufficient.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Description of Problem in FoxPro 2.x</h3>
 
<P>
If you choose OK in the window that displays the "Not enough disk space"
error message, a WAIT WINDOW with the text "Source not available" may
appear at the top-right corner of the screen. After that window is
displayed, a standard FoxPro error dialog box will appear with the
following message
<P>
<PRE>     Not enough disk space for &lt;file name&gt;

</PRE>followed by three buttons:
<P>
<PRE>     Cancel, Suspend, Ignore

</PRE>If you choose the Ignore button, control will return to the Command window
if the Table Wizard was invoked from the Run menu when the Command window
was the active window. If the Table Wizard was invoked from the Catalog
Manager, control will return to the Catalog Manager when the Ignore button
is chosen. Depending upon the amount of free space available when the
Wizard is executed, the "Source not available" error and subsequent error
messages may or may not appear.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem in FoxPro 2.x</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start the Table Wizard.

<P><LI>In the Step 2 window, when you are asked "By which fields do you want to
   sort the records?", select one or more fields.

<P><LI>In the Step 3 window, select one of the following radio buttons before
   choosing the Finish button:
<P>
<P><PRE>     - Save Table
     - Save And Browse For Data Entry
     - Save And Create An AutoScreen For Data Entry
</PRE>
<P><LI>In the Save As dialog box, specify drive A as the location at which the
   file should be created.

<P><LI>Insert a disk in drive A that has enough free space to accommodate the
   .DBF file but not enough to accommodate the .CDX file.
<P>
</OL>The error message mentioned above will appear when the following command is
executed in the Table Wizard:
<P>
<PRE>   INDEX ON &amp;tagexpr tag &amp;tagname

</PRE></OL>The INDEX ON command fails because there is not enough free disk space for
the creation of a .CDX file.
<P>
<P><h3>Description of Problem in Visual FoxPro for Windows</h3>
 
<P>
The table will be created and left open, but no CDX will be generated.
<P>
A subsequent attempt to USE the table causes a "File is in use" error
message to be displayed.
<P>
The file will not appear in the View window, and the only way to close the
table is to quit Visual FoxPro.
<P>
In Visual FoxPro for Windows version 5.0a, the following message is
displayed when the wizard finishes.
<P>
<PRE>   Not enough disk space for table and indexes

</PRE>The table and the CDX are both there, and the Properties window displays
the indexes created, but setting the order after entering a few records may
or may not set the table order correctly. If the table is closed, there may
be no records.
