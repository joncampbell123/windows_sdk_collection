<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Tabbing through radio (option) buttons in FoxPro for Windows is
handled differently than it is in FoxPro for MS-DOS if KEYCOMP is set
to WINDOWS. When the selection cursor is on a radio button in FoxPro
for MS-DOS, pressing TAB moves the selection cursor to the next button
in the set. If the selection cursor is on a radio button in FoxPro for
Windows, pressing TAB moves the selection cursor to the next object on
the screen. If KEYCOMP is set to MS-DOS in FoxPro for Windows, pressing
TAB in a dialog box will behave like it does in FoxPro for MS-DOS.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In FoxPro for MS-DOS, when the selection cursor is positioned on a
radio button, it moves to the next button in the set when the TAB key
is pressed. The same holds true for push (command) buttons and
invisible buttons. In FoxPro for Windows, command buttons and
invisible buttons still work the same way, but pressing TAB when the
selection cursor is on a radio button moves to the next object, not
the next button in the set.
<P>
The way the TAB key works in FoxPro for Windows is by design. In the
Windows environment, a grouped set of radio buttons is treated as one
object for tabbing between objects. This is handled by Windows itself
and can be observed in all Windows-based applications. FoxPro for
MS-DOS versions 2.0 and 2.5 were not limited to a set definition for
how radio buttons should be accessed, so it was decided to allow
movement through the buttons with the TAB key.
