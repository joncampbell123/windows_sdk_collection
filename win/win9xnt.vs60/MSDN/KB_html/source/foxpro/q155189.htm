The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, version 2.6a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Using the BETWEEN() function in the Having window of the RQBE builder may
result in a type 11 error or may hang the machine.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Use the Selection Criteria section of the RQBE Builder to create a WHERE
clause that contains the BETWEEN() function to filter the records.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft is researching this behavior and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Using the Having window to create filter conditions for records may produce
erroneous errors or hang the machine. Placing the BETWEEN() function in a
series of three or more conditions separated by "or" clauses frequently
causes this behavior. However, the symptoms vary between machines. Starting
the machine with extensions ON also influences the type of error message
encountered. Regardless of the environment, using the BETWEEN() function in
the Having window produces one of two error conditions. First, the system
may report an erroneous type 11 error that points to a hardware problem.
Second, while in the RQBE, the machine may simply hang, forcing the
programmer to reboot.
<P>
Several different scenarios may cause these anomalies to occur. First, the
errors may occur when clicking the OK button in the Having window. Second,
they may occur when actually executing the query. Third, the error may
appear when attempting to re-enter the Having window to modify the query.
Finally, actually editing the filter conditions in the Having window may
cause the error.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Open the Clients table located in the Sample\Organize\DBFS folder.

<P><LI>Type "Create Query" (without the quotation marks) in the Command window.

<P><LI>Click the Having check box, and enter three filter conditions using the
   BETWEEN() function based on the zip field.

<P><LI>Attempt to click the OK button to close the Having window.

<P><LI>Click the Do Query button to execute the query.

<P><LI>Close the browse window, return to the RQBE builder screen, and click
   the Having checkbox.

<P><LI>Attempt to remove one or more of the filter conditions.
<P>
</OL>Depending on the machine and its configuration, the error may appear when
performing step 4, 5, 6, or 7.
