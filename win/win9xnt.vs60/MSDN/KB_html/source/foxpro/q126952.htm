<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article explains how to declare variables that exist and are visible
throughout a form but are released when the form is released.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
A variable declared in a method of a form is visible while the method is
executing. Any reference to this variable after the method exits will yield
a 'Variable not Found' error message. In Visual FoxPro, the Form Designer
builds a Form class, and a Form is an object. Variables declared in a
method such as the Init or Load are scoped to the method. A variable scoped
to a Form object has to be a member variable, or property. This differs
from the version 2.x model, where variables declared in the Setup of a
screen would be generated at the beginning of the .SPR file, and be
available to the program and procedures that the program calls.
<P>
Use the following steps to add a new property to a Form in the Form
Designer:

<OL><P><LI>Choose New Property from the Form menu.

<P><LI>Type the name of the member variable, and click OK in the dialog. The
   property is now available at the bottom of the property sheet.

<P><LI>To refer to the property from an object in the Form, you can:
<P>
   - Use the This object reference at the Form level. For example:
<P>
<PRE>        This.chvar1

   - Use the ThisForm object reference at the Object level. For example:

        ThisForm.chvar2

   - Use the name of the Form reference. For example:

        Frmtest.chvar1
</PRE>
