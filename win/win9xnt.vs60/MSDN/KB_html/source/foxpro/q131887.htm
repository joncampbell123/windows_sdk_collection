<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Issuing three or more consecutive REPORT FORM commands causes a "Printer
Not Ready" error to occur.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
PCAnywhere by Symantec adds the following lines to the SYSTEM.INI file:
<P>
<PRE>   [386 Enhanced]
   timercriticalsection=500
   device=awdos.386
   device=vpcaw.386
   device=symevnt.386

</PRE><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Remove the lines added by PCAnywhere.
<P>
If the error persists, try changing the default printer driver or adding a
few seconds of delay between each REPORT FORM command by using a FOR ..
NEXT loop. If a different printer driver eliminates the error, obtain the
latest version of the default printer driver.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you install PCAnywhere, it modifies the Windows SYSTEM.INI file and
adds a few device drivers to handle the display as well as the COM and LPT
ports. FoxPro for Windows may give you a 'Printer Not Ready' error message
when the REPORT FORM is issued three or more consecutive times. Uninstall
PCAnywhere to resolve this error. Depending on the version of PCAnywhere,
drivers other than what is listed above may exist in the INI file(s). For a
complete listing of changes done to the SYSTEM.INI or WIN.INI file, consult
with Symantec or check your documentation.
<P>
PCAnywhere is manufactured by Symantec, a vendor independent of Microsoft;
we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
performance or reliability.

Please note that the communication port architecture in version 3.1 of
Windows and Windows for Workgroups was changed in Windows for Workgroup
