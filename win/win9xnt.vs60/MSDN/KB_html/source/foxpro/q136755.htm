<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
A Visual FoxPro application design may require that the Visual FoxPro
desktop be hidden and the application's own forms occupy the entire
Windows desktop area. This article explains how to do that.
<P>
This article adds the steps necessary to make the application's form the
desktop. It concludes with the steps necessary to terminate the application
and restore the Visual FoxPro desktop.

<P><h3>Step-by-Step Procedure</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start the application's form and establish the Visual FoxPro event
   handler with the READ EVENTS command. The code in the .prg file
   continues with the procedure needed to terminate the application's form,
   stop the Visual FoxPro event handler, and return to the Visual FoxPro
   desktop. After that code there is the function to hide the main Visual
   FoxPro window.
<P>
   *******************************************************************
   ** Starter.prg  Extreme minimum sample Code to start the application
   *******************************************************************
   *
   DO FORM appform.scx
   READ EVENTS
<P>
   PROCEDURE back2vfp
   ** The application's form was activated from the desktop level as a
   ** desktop level form. The event handler is at the desktop level, and
   ** is equivalent to a property of the _SCREEN object, so it must be
   ** terminated by a method of the _SCREEN object. As no _SCREEN
   ** object members are visible (no command buttons, text boxes, etc.),
   ** a Timer event is used to clear events. The timer object is not
   ** visible, and doesn't need to be in order to be activated.
   ** To activate the Timer: Add it to the _SCREEN
   *
   _SCREEN.AddObject('oTime','MyTimer')  &amp;&amp; MyTimer is the
<PRE>   **                                       current instance
   ** End of procedure Back2vfp
   **
   ** Class definition. The TIMER event is triggered after two seconds
   DEFINE CLASS MyTimer AS Timer

      Interval= 2000

      PROCEDURE Timer
         CLEAR EVENTS
         _SCREEN.RemoveObject('oTime')
      ENDPROC
   ENDDEFINE
   **
   ** End of extreme minimum sample Starter.prg*******************
   ***************************************************************

</PRE><P><LI>In the application's form, declare three properties of the form to serve
   as global references in the following function. Also place a command
   button or other object on the form, this object provides an event that
   can terminate the application. For this example, name the three
   properties FoxHWND, FoxGone, and ShowState. Name the command button
   Quit. Its Click event will contain code to terminate the form.
<P>
   CAUTION: If a template class is used to create a form, and its DeskTop
   property is set to .F., then setting the DeskTop property of the created
   form to .T. will have no effect. In that case, running the form will
   cause the main Visual FoxPro Window and the form within it to not be
   visible, which will require a rebooting in Windows 3.x, and potentially
   damaging files associated with the application.
<P>

</PRE></OL><h3>Caveats</h3>
 
<P>
If this code is placed in a project and built into an application, the user
will receive the following error messages in a Locate File dialog box:
<P>
<PRE>   Unable to find Unknown FINDWINDOW
   Locate, Ignore, Ignore All, Cancel

</PRE>Once the user chooses Ignore, the following error messages appear:
<P>
<PRE>   Unable to find Unknown SHOWWINDOW.
   Locate, Ignore, Ignore All, Cancel

</PRE>This is because Visual FoxPro is trying to resolve the external references
in the DECLARE statements associated in the Load event's code. The user
can:

<UL><LI>Ignore the errors, and the project will build without a problem.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Add a program to the project that references the FINDWINDOW and
   SHOWWINDOW as a procedure or a function.
