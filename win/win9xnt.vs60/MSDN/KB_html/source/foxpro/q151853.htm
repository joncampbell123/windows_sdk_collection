The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
To use the Pivot Table Wizard in Visual FoxPro for Macintosh successfully,
Microsoft Excel 5.0 and Microsoft Query must be properly installed. Since
Excel uses the FoxPro ODBC driver when creating the pivot table, the Q+E
ODBC FoxPro Driver must be installed and a data source for FoxPro files
must be setup in the ODBC Setup control panel. Excel and Microsoft Office
install Microsoft Query and the ODBC files necessary to access FoxPro files
using Excel and Microsoft Query. If you are doing a less-than-complete
install of Excel or Office, choose the Data Access options to install
Microsoft Query and the ODBC files.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following three messages may be received in Visual FoxPro if a required
file is missing, damaged, or is the wrong version. Under each message is
information on what files may be missing or how to fix the condition that
is causing the Pivot Table Wizard not to complete. The information on files
is based on Microsoft Office version 4.2. Future releases of Office may
cause some of this information to change.

<OL><P><LI>"Microsoft Query has not been installed properly and is needed in order
   to create an Excel pivot table."
<P>
   To fix this condition, make sure Microsoft Query is installed in the
   Microsoft folder on the Macintosh. It should be version 1.0. Reinstall
   Microsoft Query from the Excel or Office source disk.

<P><LI>"Failed to get Excel OLE object."
<P>
   One or more of the following files may be missing or damaged. In all
   cases below, the Pivot Table Wizard will not even be able to load
   Excel. Note that Excel needs the Microsoft OLE Automation and Microsoft
   OLE Library just to load on its own:
<P>
   a. fxOLE30b.cfm - This file installs with Visual FoxPro and resides in
<P><PRE>      the System:Extensions folder. It should be 163,604 bytes in size. No
      version. The Pivot Table Wizard will not make use of fxOLE30b.slm
      if the cfm is not available.
</PRE><P>
   b. Microsoft OLE Automation - This file installs with Visual FoxPro and
<P><PRE>      is also located in the System:Extensions folder. It is version 2.06
      and is 537,822 bytes in size. It is one of three OLE files installed
      by Visual FoxPro.
</PRE><P>
   c. Microsoft OLE Library - Another of the three OLE extensions that
<P><PRE>      Visual FoxPro installs. This is also version 2.06 and is 964,784
      bytes in size. The remaining OLE extension that Visual FoxPro
      installs, Microsoft OLE Extension, is not used by the Pivot Table
      Wizard and will not cause the above message if it is missing. Make
      sure that it is installed, however. It is version 2.07 and is
      949,173 bytes in size.
</PRE><P>
   d. PPC Registration Database - This file is located in the
<P><PRE>      System:Preferences folder. The number of installed applications
      will determine this file's size. If this file has been deleted
      since Excel was installed or was last run, it will cause the above
      message and the Pivot Table Wizard will fail. To correct this
      condition, start Excel to re-register it. The Pivot Table Wizard
      will complete if this was the only problem.
</PRE>
<P><LI>"An OLE automation error occurred. Your Excel pivot table may not be
   complete."
<P>
   This message indicates that one of the ODBC components is missing or
   damaged. The key files to check for are listed below. Note that the
   ODBC files with "PPC" on the ends of their names are installed by Visual
   FoxPro and will not work with Excel 5.0 and the Q+E ODBC FoxPro Driver.
   In all cases below, Excel will start, but the pivot table will not be
   created. Switching back to Visual FoxPro will reveal the above message.
<P>
   a. ODBC Configuration Manager - Located in the System:Extensions
<P><PRE>      folder, this should be version 1.0. It is 29,835 bytes in size.
      Although this file is installed by Excel or Office, it is supplied
      by Apple Computer, Inc.
</PRE><P>
   b. ODBC Driver Manager - Also in the System:Extensions folder. It is
<P><PRE>      version 1.0 and is 51,175 bytes. An Apple Computer, Inc. file.
</PRE><P>
   c. Q+E ODBC FoxPro Driver - Located in the System:Extensions folder.
<P><PRE>      This file has an Intersolv, Inc. copyright. It is version 1.2.0 and
      is 772,536 bytes in size. If this file is missing, the Data Source
      For Connection dialog will appear in Excel but there will not be an
      option for an ODBC driver to access FoxPro files. Choosing Cancel in
      the dialog will produce the above message in Visual FoxPro.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      Even if the Q+E ODBC FoxPro Driver file is installed, if no data
      source has been set up to use it, the Data Source For Connection
      dialog will not have an appropriate ODBC driver for the Pivot Table
      Wizard to use. Set up a data source to use the Q+E FoxPro Driver by
      using the ODBC Setup control panel. The ODBC setup control panel is
      also installed by Excel and/or Office. It is an Apple Computer, Inc.
      file. It is version 1.0 and is 5,888 bytes in size. The data sources
      that are set up in it are stored in the ODBC Preferences file found
      in the System:Preferences folder.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      To setup a data source for FoxPro files:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>         1. Open the ODBC Setup control panel, and choose the Setup Data
            Sources... button.

         2. Once in the ODBC Data Sources dialog, choose the Add... button.

         3. Select the Q+E/Microsoft FoxPro Driver as the driver, and
            choose the OK button.

         4. Type in a Data Source Name. The other settings can be left as
            they appear. Choose OK.

</PRE></OL>Visual FoxPro for Macintosh has the ability to distribute run-time
applications to 68K (non-PowerPC) Macintoshes. One of the options in Step 2
of the Setup Wizard is to include support for the SQL Server ODBC Driver.
If a Visual FoxPro run-time application for a 68K Macintosh is installed on
a PowerPC that has Excel or Office and Visual FoxPro on it, the ODBC files
referred to above will be replaced with newer versions supplied by
Visigenic Software, Inc. The Q+E FoxPro ODBC Driver installed by Excel or
Office is a 68K driver and will work with these newer ODBC files. The
relevant files, their version and size are listed below. These are the
versions from Visigenic:
<P>
<PRE>        File Name                 Version                 Size
        ---------                 -------                 ----
   ODBC Setup control panel        2.1.1               94,891 bytes
   ODBC Configuration Manager      2.1.1              146,675 bytes
   ODBC Driver Manager             2.1.1               66,631 bytes
