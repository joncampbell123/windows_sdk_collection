The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In certain cases, the DIRECTORY or DIR command in Visual FoxPro returns a
value different from that returned by the same command, in the same case,
in FoxPro version 2.x for Windows.
<P>
One such case is when running Visual FoxPro under Windows NT. The
difference occurs when the default is set to a subdirectory on a remote
share with a network drive/directory combination, and then the default is
changed back to the local drive. Visual FoxPro sees the remote share's root
as the "current" directory of the remote drive, while FoxPro for Windows
sees the directory set by the SET DEFAULT command as the current directory
of the remote drive.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Visual FoxPro relies on the operating system to provide identification of
the "current" directory for each drive. Windows NT does not keep a list of
the current directory for each drive. FoxPro for Windows retains a variable
defining the default directory settings for drives.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Developers need to be aware of this behavior and compensate for it in the
design of the application if necessary.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 
<P>
This behavior can be demonstrated by using two computers, one of which is
running Windows NT version 3.5 or later (Workstation or Server). Both
computers must be on a common network.

<OL><P><LI>On the Windows NT computer, load both FoxPro version 2.6a for Windows
   and Visual FoxPro for Windows 3.0.

<P><LI>Create three table (.dbf) files, each with a memo (.fpt) file. Name one
   Parent and the other two child1 and child2.

<P><LI>On the second computer's hard drive, create a first-level directory
   named Asample. Under it, create a subdirectory named Subdir. Share
   Asample.

<P><LI>Copy the child1 and child2 tables and their memo files to
   C:\Asample\Subdir.

<P><LI>Copy the Parent table and its memo file to C:\Asample

<P><LI>Connect the Windows NT computer to the remote share. For example, in the
   Windows NT File Manager, on the Drive menu, click Connect Network Drive.
   In the path edit box of the Connect Network Drive dialog box, enter:
<P>
   \\&lt;name of remote computer&gt;\Asample

<P><LI>Note the drive letter assigned to the remote drive. For the purposes of
   this article assume the letter is E, so the remote share is E:

<P><LI>Start FoxPro for Windows and enter the following commands in the Command
   window:
<P>
   SET DEFAULT TO E:\subdir
   SET DEFAULT TO C:
<PRE>   DIR E:            &amp;&amp; Make a note of the values and their appearance
   DIR E:*.*         &amp;&amp; Also note the values and their appearance

</PRE><P><LI>Quit FoxPro for Windows. Start Visual FoxPro.

<P><LI>In Visual FoxPro's Command window, issue the commands shown in step 8.
<P>
</OL>Visual FoxPro sees the root of the remote drive as the current directory
once the default directory is no longer on the remote drive.
