The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS, versions 2.0, 2.5, 2.5a, 2.5b, 2.6
<LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5, 2.5a, 2.5b, 2.6
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Output that is directed to the screen and is underneath an active window is
not visible. This behavior may occur when you are executing a program that
was created for dBASE IV.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
In FoxPro, a window is opaque. Output directed to a location on the screen
that is underneath a window will therefore not be visible until the window
is moved, released, or hidden. In dBASE IV, a window has certain
transparent attributes. Therefore, output directed to a location on the
screen that is underneath a window may actually appear inside the window.
This behavioral difference cannot be avoided with the SET COMPATIBLE
command.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
If you need to place text in a window, use the DEFINE WINDOW command to
create a window and then draw text directly in that window. If you need to
place text on the screen so that it appears to be inside a window, use the
@ ... TO command to create a border that simulates the border of a window.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 
<P>
The following code can be used to reproduce the behavioral differences
explained in this article:
<P>
<PRE>     DEFINE WINDOW test FROM 10,10 TO 20,40
     ACTIVATE WINDOW test
     ACTIVATE SCREEN
     @ 15,20 SAY "Overwrite"
     i = INKEY(0)
     RELEASE WINDOW test

</PRE>When this code is executed in dBASE IV, the word "Overwrite" will appear
inside the window. When this code is executed in FoxPro, the word
"Overwrite" will appear underneath the window and will not become visible
until the window is released.
