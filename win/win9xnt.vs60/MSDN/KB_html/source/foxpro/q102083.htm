<P>
<P><h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
 
<P>
The FoxDoc application uses default templates to generate printed
documentation about FoxPro programs, applications, or entire projects.
These default templates are embedded in the Foxdoc.app file and are
not available as separate files.
<P>
The disk included with this Application Note contains an updated
version of FoxDoc that allows you to use different templates. This
disk also contains the original template files, which you can modify
and then use in FoxDoc to customize your printed documentation.
<P>
<P><h3>To install the templates and updated FoxDoc files</h3>
 

<UL><LI>Copy all the files from the enclosed FW0844 disk to your FOXPROW
   directory.
<P>
   For example, to copy the files from your floppy disk drive A to the
   FOXPROW directory on drive C, type the following command at the
   MS-DOS command prompt and press ENTER:
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy a:\*.* c:\foxprow
</PRE><P>
</UL><h2>HOW FOXDOC USES TEMPLATES</h2>
 
<P>
<PRE>   NOTE: The terms "template" and "report" can be used interchangeably
   in this document. The FoxDoc application and its dialog boxes refer
   to "templates," which are actually FoxPro report files. You can
   modify a FoxDoc template the same way you modify any other FoxPro
   report.

</PRE>FoxDoc creates its reports by first reading a .prg or .doc file (which
are text files) into a database, and then issuing a REPORT FORM
command on the database. You cannot control how the text file is
imported into the database, but you can modify the template used to
print from the database. There are separate templates for source code
files, action diagrams, documentation reports, and the table of
contents.
<P>
For example, the action diagram template would be used once for each
action diagram file that FoxDoc produces. FoxDoc performs the
following actions for each action diagram:

<OL><P><LI>Identifies the next action diagram.
</OL>2. Imports it into a temporary database.
3. Issues a REPORT FORM template_filename TO PRINT command to print
<PRE>   the action diagram using the appropriate action diagram report
   template.
</PRE></OL>4. Repeats from step 1, until all the action diagrams have been
<PRE>   printed. The template is "called" once for each action diagram
   file.

</PRE>To specify the templates used by FoxDoc
 
<P>
To view the default templates, start FoxDoc. From the FoxDoc main
dialog box, under Other Options, choose the Printing button, then the
Templates button. The Printing Templates dialog box displays the list
of templates used for the following:
<P>
<PRE>  Programs:               fdprg.frx
  Action Diagrams:        fdact.frx
  Documentation Reports:  fddoc.frx
  Table of Contents:      fdtoc.frx

</PRE>To use a different template, choose the appropriate button, select the
desired template (.FRX file) from the Open dialog box, then choose the
Open button. FoxDoc will now use that template to print your
documentation.
<P>
<P><h3>Tips on Modifying the FoxDoc Templates</h3>
 
<P>
When creating or modifying a FoxDoc template, you can use the
following fields:
<P>
<PRE> Field name           Description
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------

 fd_name:             The name of the current file that is being
                      printed
 fd_sysname:          The name of the application system that is being
                      documented and printed (taken from first FoxDoc
                      screen)
 fd_author:           The system author (taken from first FoxDoc
                      screen)
 fd_copyrightdate:    The copyright date (taken from first FoxDoc
                      screen)
 fd_holder:           The copyright holder (taken from first FoxDoc
                      screen)
 fd_reporttime:       The time that the first report was printed (so
                      that all reports from a single documentation
                      session can have the same date and time)
 line:                A single line from the file that is being
                      printed

</PRE>Typically, the detail band of the report template contains only the
line field and nothing else.
<P>
In addition, FoxPro system variables (for example, _PAGENO) can be
used. The best way to see how these are used is to study the existing
templates, which use many of these variables.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE UPDATED FOXDOC FILES</h2>
 
<P>
The FoxDoc files supplied with this Application Note (Foxdoc.app,
Foxdoc.fll, and Foxdoc.msg) are the same files included with FoxPro
2.5a for Windows. These files correct a problem with selecting
alternative template files in the FoxDoc application in FoxPro 2.5 for
Windows. In the Printing Templates dialog box (under Other Options
select the Printing button, then the Templates button) in FoxDoc 2.5,
the template file used for each item is listed in the adjacent text
box. When you try to select a different template file by choosing the
appropriate button under Report Form Templates For and then selecting
a template file from the Open dialog box, the FoxDoc template file in
the text box reverts to the default file instead of being replaced by
the file that you just selected.
