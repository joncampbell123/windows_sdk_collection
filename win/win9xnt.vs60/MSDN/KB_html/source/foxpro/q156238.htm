The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows versions, 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
A form released from a procedure or command called from a menu or an ON KEY
LABEL command is not actually released until the command or procedure has
completed.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Set the Visible property of the form to .F. - False to hide the form until
the procedure that releases it has finished executing.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Keypress event of the form intercepts the keystroke, and the form
cannot be released until the procedure or command called by the keystroke
has completed.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 
1. Run the following code from a .prg:
<P>
<PRE>   ON KEY LABEL F3 DO Release_It
   oForm = CREATEOBJECT('form')
   oForm.Caption = "Press F3 to release form, then F3 to Clear Events"
   oForm.SHOW()
   READ EVENTS
   ON KEY LABEL F3

   PROCEDURE Release_It
       oForm.RELEASE
       =MESSAGEBOX("Though form has been released, _SCREEN.Formcount = " ;
         + ALLTR(STR(_SCREEN.FORMCOUNT,1)) + ". Press F3 after OK to " ;
         + "return to Command Window." ,0)
       ON KEY LABEL F3 CLEAR EVENTS
   ENDPROC

</PRE><P><LI>Press the F3 key. The message box indicates the form still exists since
   the FormCount property of the _SCREEN system variable still returns 1.

<P><LI>Click OK then press F3 to return to the Command window.
<P>
</OL>Modify the Release_It procedure in the above example as follows to
demonstrate the workaround. (The form is still not immediately released
from memory but setting the Visible property to .F. - False makes it appear
released.)
<P>
<PRE>   PROCEDURE Release_It
      oForm.Visible = .F.
      oForm.RELEASE
      =MESSAGEBOX("Though form has been released, _SCREEN.Formcount = " ;
        + ALLTR(STR(_SCREEN.FORMCOUNT,1)) + ". Press F3 after OK to " ;
        + "return to Command Window." ,0)
      ON KEY LABEL F3 CLEAR EVENTS
   ENDPROC
</PRE>
