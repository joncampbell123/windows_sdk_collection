The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Visual FoxPro has a limitation on the length of report bands. The maximum
length for a single band is the page length.
<P>
It is possible to create a report that simulates a detail band with a
length greater than the length of a single page. This requires setting up a
dummy data grouping on RECNO(&lt;table with records repeating in the detail
band&gt;), and creating what amounts to a larger "virtual" Detail Band
comprised of the RECNO() Group Header, the actual Detail Band, and the
RECNO() Group Footer. See the MORE INFORMATION section of this document for
details.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To create a sample report demonstrating this behavior, complete the
following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Create a new report.

<P><LI>Make a Quick Report using Report/Quick Report from the Visual FoxPro
   menu.

<P><LI>Select the Customer table in the VFP\Samples\Data directory when
   prompted for a table.

<P><LI>Select the "Field layout" button on the right from the Quick Report
   dialog box, then click OK.

<P><LI>In the Report Designer, set up a data grouping. This is done by
   selecting Report/Data Grouping from the menu.

<P><LI>In the "Group expressions" box, type the expression "RECNO('customer'),"
   without the outer quotes, into the top box. Optionally, you may select
   the "Start each group on a new page" check box to start each new virtual
   detail band on a new page. Click OK to close the dialog box.

<P><LI>Double-click on the Page Header separator bar, and set the Page Header
   height to .25", and select the "Constant band height" check box.

<P><LI>Double-click on the Page Footer separator bar, and set the Page Footer
   height to .25".

<P><LI>To simulate a two-page "detail band," set the Group Header for the
   RECNO() band height to 10 inches (for portrait page layout), and the
   Detail Band height to 10 inches. These are accessed by double-clicking
   the separator bar for each band. Select the "Constant band height" check
   box for each band as well, then click OK to close the dialog box.

<P><LI>To simulate a three-page "Detail Band," follow Step 9 above but also
   set the Group Footer band height for the RECNO() band to 10 inches as
   well and select the "Constant band height" check box, and then click OK
   to close the dialog box.

<P><LI>Place some of the fields added when the Quick report was made at the
   top and bottom of each of the bands sized in Step 9 and optionally
   Step 10.

<P><LI>Preview the report. Each of the 10-inch bands print on a different
   page, but since the group breaks on RECNO() the group header and footer
   will also print information from that detail record alone.
<P>
</OL>NOTES:

<UL><LI>It is not necessary to have the Group and Detail bands exactly 10
   inches, but the sum of the height of each of these individual bands plus
   the Page Header and Page Footer heights should be around 10.5 inches.

<LI>Having report fields that print memo data or are set to stretch can
   cause unexpected results with the above scenario.
