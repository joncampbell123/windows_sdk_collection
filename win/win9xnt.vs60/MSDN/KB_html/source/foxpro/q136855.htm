<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article explains the differences between buffering, referential
integrity (RI), and triggers, and it describes when each should be used.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Buffering</h3>
 
<P>
To directly update tables or records in a multiuser environment, use row
and table buffering. This eliminates the need to place the data from a
record into memory variables (memvars), edit the memvars, check the record
for changes, and then write the changes to the record. See the Buffering
topic in the Visual FoxPro Help file for more detailed information.
<P>
<P><h3>Referential Integrity (RI)</h3>
 
<P>
This refers to the rules that govern data integrity between related tables
(primary key/foreign key). In addition to using engine-level enforcement of
primary keys, you can create stored procedures that take certain actions
when a row is updated, deleted, or inserted.
<P>
The RI Builder will create one of the following stored procedures for each
action:

<UL><LI>Update: Ignore, Cascade, or Restrict
<LI>Delete: Ignore, Cascade, or Restrict
<LI>Insert: Ignore and Restrict
<P>
</UL>The names of these stored procedures are placed under the proper trigger in
the Table Properties section of the Table Designer.
<P>
<P><h3>Triggers</h3>
 
<P>
Record-level event code runs after an insert, update, or delete. triggers
run after rules, and they do not run when buffering is in effect until
TABLEUPDATE() is issued. In the case of row buffering, the record pointer
is moved.
<P>
Triggers can be created by using the CREATE TRIGGER command or by adding a
stored procedure to the Database Container and referencing the stored
procedure in the appropriate trigger in the Table Properties dialog box of
the Table Designer.
<P>
Buffering and RI can be used independently of each other, and the use of RI
does not necessarily mandate that buffering be used. In a multiuser
environment, you would typically use buffering whether or not any RI was in
place.
<P>
Although triggers are typically used to implement (by using the RI Builder)
Cascade or Restrict capabilities on Update and Delete, or Restrict
capabilities on Insert, these Triggers can also be used to call stored
procedures that undertake actions wholly unrelated to RI. For example, an
Update Trigger might call a stored procedure that sends an email message to
another department to notify them of a change.
