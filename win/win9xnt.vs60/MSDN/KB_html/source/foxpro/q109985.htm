<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The FoxPro DELETE FILE function does not accept wildcards. To delete files
using wildcards, you must build a program that loops through all files
meeting the file specification and pass the filenames one by one to the
DELETE FILE function.
<P>
The program below is provided as an example of using FoxPro's functions
to simulate the MS-DOS DELETE command.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<PRE>   * Procedure to delete a number of files using a file skeleton
   * similar to the MS-DOS command DEL *.BAK. Just like its MS-DOS
   * equivalent, you can also pass it a path if the files to be
   * deleted are NOT in the default (current) directory. Use with
   * caution!
   *
   PARAMETERS whatpath
   IF TYPE("whatpath")#"C"
      WAIT WINDOW 'You must pass a file skeleton'+CHR(13)+ ;
                  'Such as "*.*" or "C:\FOXPROW\DATA\*.BAK"'
      RETURN

   filename=SYS(2000,whatpath)        &amp;&amp; return first filename
   DO WHILE LEN(filename) &gt; 0         &amp;&amp; is there a file?
      IF filecount=0                  &amp;&amp; do this only the first time
         *activate library
         SET LIBRARY TO SYS(2004)+'foxtools' ADDITIVE
         libactive=.T.                &amp;&amp; boolean to indicate library use
      ENDIF
      DELETE FILE (forcepath(filename, justpath(whatpath)))  &amp;&amp; lib call
      filecount=filecount+1           &amp;&amp; keep track of number of files
      filename=SYS(2000,whatpath,1)   &amp;&amp; next filename
   ENDDO
   IF libactive                       &amp;&amp; if library was opened, close it
      RELEASE LIBRARY SYS(2004)+'foxtools'
