The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0
</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you add objects to a form, the objects are referenced in the order
they were added to the form. Therefore, a refresh causes the objects to be
refreshed in the same order they were added to the form. It is not possible
to alter this order from the form itself, other than by removing the
objects and placing them back onto the form in the order desired.

<P><h3>Steps to Demonstrate Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create a new form in Visual FoxPro.

<P><LI>Add 2 text boxes and a command button.

<P><LI>In the refresh method for Text1, enter this code:
<P>
   WAIT WINDOW "Refresh method for text1"

<P><LI>In the refresh method for Text2, enter this code:
<P>
   WAIT WINDOW "Refresh method for text2"

<P><LI>In the click event of the command button, add this code:
<P>
   Thisform.refresh()

<P><LI>Run the form. You will see the WAIT WINDOW for Text1 fire, then the WAIT
   WINDOW for Text2 fire. Click the command button and the WAIT WINDOWs
   appear in the same order again (Text1 then Text2).

<P><LI>Modify the form, and click the Text1 box. Select the edit menu and
   choose cut, or press CTRL+X. The Text1 box disappears from the form.

<P><LI>Select edit and paste, or press CTRL+V. The Text1 box reappears.

<P><LI>Run the form again, and notice that the refresh events of the text boxes
   fire differently now (Text2 then Text1).
<P>
</OL>It is possible to modify the .SCX file, and move records around to affect
the order that objects are refreshed. The memo field "objname" in the .SCX
file contains the names of the objects. Moving the records containing the
objects on the form affects the refresh order.
