<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
FOXRSTRT.EXE is used when Visual FoxPro is installed under Windows and
Windows for Workgroups. This article describes the purpose of this
executable and gives some of the errors that can occur with FOXRSTRT.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
As a 32-bit application, Visual FoxPro requires a 32-bit operating
environment. Under Windows and Windows for Workgroups, the Setup program
detects that the native operating environment is 16-bit, so it installs
Win32s along with a 32-bit executable and 32-bit OLE custom controls (.OCX
files).
<P>
When the installation is complete, the system must restart Windows to
register the 32-bit .OCX files and assign an icon to VFP.EXE. After you
reboot (restart) your computer, it is running Win32s (32-bit environment)
and FOXRSTRT.EXE is launched. This executable tells the 32-bit .OCX files
to self register and assigns an icon to the 32-bit VFP.EXE and
IMAGEDIT.EXE. FOXRSTRT.EXE is called in the Load line of the WIN.INI, and
runs only once after you install Visual FoxPro under Windows and Windows
for Workgroups.
<P>
FOXRSTRT.EXE may take a few minutes to run, and restarting Windows might be
slower than usual. If by accident you manually reboot the machine before
FOXRSTRT has completed, the .OCX files might not be registered, and the
MS-DOS icon might still be assigned to the VFP.EXE file. You can however
perform these tasks manually:

<UL><LI>To reassign a correct icon for 32-bit Visual FoxPro, select the Visual
   FoxPro icon in Program Manager; then click Properties on the Files menu.

<LI>To register .OCX files, run REGSVR32.EXE located in the VFP\SAMPLES\OLE
   directory. Use the following syntax for each .OCX file if FOXRSTRT fails
   or is interrupted:
<P>
<P><PRE>      REGSVR32.EXE c:\windows\system\msoutl32.ocx
</PRE><P>
</UL>The .OCX files that Visual FoxPro installs in the Windows and Windows for
Workgroups platforms are located in the WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory and are:
<P>
<PRE>   Outline            MSOUTL32.OCX
   Picture Clip       PICCLP32.OCX

</PRE>For more information about these controls, search for "OLE controls" in the
Visual FoxPro Help menu.
<P>
<P><h3>Troubleshooting Error Messages</h3>
 
<P>
"Load line contains more than 90 characters" Error:
<P>
If the LOAD line of the WIN.INI file contains more than 90 characters after
Setup installs Win32s, a system error related to a device driver might
occur when you restart Windows. This behavior occurs because setup adds
FOXRSTRT.EXE to the LOAD line. The addition of characters causes an error.
<P>
"Missing or Invalid FOXSTART.DAT" Error:
<P>
This error might occur if setup has not completed. When this error happens,
FOXRSTRT is not removed from the WIN.INI file. You can safely remove
FOXRSTRT.EXE from the LOAD line in the WIN.INI file; then follow the
procedure described above to manually register the .OCX files and assign an
icon to VFP.EXE and to IMAGEDIT.EXE.
