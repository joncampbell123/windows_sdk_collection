The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, versions 2.5b, 2.5c, 2.6a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Changes made to a screen that resides on a server do not always appear if a
new .spr file is generated from the workstation without first deleting the
.spx file.
<P>
NOTE: The workstation is mounted on to the server through System 7's peer-
to-peer network. All the screen files (.scx, .spr, .spx, and so on) reside
on the server.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The .spr file gets the timestamp from the server's clock, and the .spx file
gets the timestamp from the workstation's clock. The problem occurs when
the workstation's system clock is approximately 8 minutes faster than the
server's system clock.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>On a Macintosh running System 7, turn on Sharing through the Control
   Panel - Sharing Setup.

<P><LI>Select the folder.

<P><LI>Select File Sharing..., select "Share this item and its contents" and
   all the options (See Folders, See Files, Make Changes).

<P><LI>Create, generate, and run a screen in this shared folder. Then close all
   files by entering CLOSE ALL in the Command window.

<P><LI>On another Macintosh running System 7, use the Control Panel to change
   the system clock to approximately 8 minutes faster.

<P><LI>Access the shared folder.

<P><LI>Load FoxPro and modify the screen .scx file.

<P><LI>Generate and run the screen. The modifications that were made to the
   .scx file are not shown when the .spr file is ran. The original .scx
   file remains unchanged.
