The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5x, 2.6, 2.6a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
FoxPro for Windows network installation modifies and copies many files
during the two types of installations started with its setup switches,
/A and /N. These switches are described below.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>SETUP /A</h3>
 
<P>
SETUP /A performs an administrative setup of FoxPro. It uncompresses,
renames, and copies the files from the installation disks to the
specified network directory. This directory will be used for the
shared copy of FoxPro for the network. If SETUP /A is run twice, once
on the server (which is appropriate) and then on the workstation
(inappropriate) the following warning will appear:
<P>
<PRE>   # OF BYTES COPIED INCORRECT

</PRE>When you are running an administrative setup on a shared copy of
Windows, make sure that Windows is not being used elsewhere on the
network.
<P>
<P><h3>SETUP /N</h3>
 
<P>
SETUP /N performs a network workstation setup of FoxPro. It requires a
previous administrative setup of FoxPro. SETUP /N allows a shared copy
of FoxPro to be run and requires the least amount of disk space. It
prompts for a location to create a personal FOXPROW directory and
copies the following files to this directory:
<P>
<PRE>   FOXUSER.DBF
   FOXUSER.FPT

</PRE>Running this installation setup with a shared copy of Windows requires
full rights to the shared Windows directory and the files in it, as
well as to each personal Windows directory. If SETUP /N is run without
full rights to the shared Windows directory, the following error
message will be received:
<P>
<PRE>   CANNOT CHANGE PROPERTIES OF FILE: DDEML.DLL

</PRE>During an installation in a shared Windows directory environment,
SETUP /N will modify the following files in the personal Windows
directory:
<P>
<PRE>   WIN.INI (the [MSAPPS], [MS Proofing Tools], and [embedding] sections)
   REG.DAT

</PRE>It also copies the following files to the personal Windows directory:
<P>
<PRE>   WINHELP.EXE
   WINHELP.HLP
   FOXPROFO.GRP (if told to create new group)

</PRE>It copies the following files to the shared Windows directory or to
the personal Windows directory if the workstation is running a
nonshared copy of Windows:
<P>
<PRE>   OLECLI.DLL      TOOLHELP.DLL
   OLESVR.DLL      VER.DLL
   DDEML.DLL       SHELL.DLL
   FOXPRINT.FOT    FOXPRINT.TTF
   COMMDLG.DLL

</PRE>NOTE: The above files are copied and the .DLLs are modified each time
SETUP /N is run.
<P>
If SETUP /N is executed without a prior SETUP /A, the Setup program
will proceed with a normal setup (that is a setup without any
switches).
<P>
Running a minimum installation from floppy disks (A:SETUP /N) does not
modify any *.INI files. However, it does prompt for a location to
create a personal FOXPROW directory and copies the following files to
the personal FOXPROW directory:
<P>
<PRE>   CONFIG.FPW         DRIVERD.FLL
   EUROPEAN.MEN       FOX.BMP
   FOX.MSK            FOXFONT.850
   FOXFONT.852        FOXFONT.FON
   FOXPROW.EXE        FOXRUN.PIF
   FOXSTART.APP       FOXTOOLS.FLL
   FOXUSER.DBF        FOXUSER.FPT
   GENMENU.PRG        GENPD.APP
   GENSCRN.PRG        GENXTAB.PRG
   PSAPI.FLL          PSSKB.TXT
   README.TXT         RESERVED.FLL
   TRANSPRT.PRG

</PRE>During a minimum installation from floppy disks, the Setup program
will copy the following files to the shared Windows directory if the
workstation is running a shared copy of Windows, or to the personal
Windows directory if the workstation is running a nonshared copy of
Windows:
<P>
<PRE>   OLECLI.DLL      TOOLHELP.DLL
   OLESVR.DLL      VER.DLL
   DDEML.DLL       SHELL.DLL
   FOXPRINT.FOT    FOXPRINT.TTF
   COMMDLG.DLL

</PRE>No matter how SETUP /N is run (SETUP /N or A:SETUP /N), the following
files are always copied to the personal Windows directory:
<P>
<PRE>   WINHELP.EXE     WINHELP.HLP
