The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, Professional Edition, version 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, attempting to print a report showing a
general field containing a Microsoft Equation 2.0 object produces the
following error:
<P>
<PRE>   Sorry, a system error occurred.
   "PrinterShare GX"
   unimplemented trap

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This seems to be a problem with Equation 2.0 as Microsoft Word 6.0.1 for
the Power Macintosh also crashes with the same error when printing a
document with an Equation 2.0 object on it.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Do not use QuickDraw GX when printing a report that has Microsoft Equation
2.0 objects in the source table and the report is printing the general
fields that they are stored in.
<P>
Converting the Equation 2.0 objects into static pictures in the general
field does not solve the problem.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft is researching this behavior and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Note that it may be necessary to clear out the GX printer's print queue to
resume normal printing after encountering this problem.
<P>
Microsoft Equation 2.0 is an applet that can be installed with Microsoft
Word for Macintosh. It is also included with Microsoft Word for Windows so
Equation 2.0 objects might find their way into a table that is used on both
the Windows and Macintosh platforms even though the Macintosh version of
Microsoft Word may not be in use.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps To Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 
<P>
The following steps assume a working knowledge of Visual FoxPro and the
Macintosh System software, how to determine if QuickDraw GX is loaded and
used, and that Microsoft Word for Macintosh is installed, including
Microsoft Equation 2.0.

<OL><P><LI>Make sure the QuickDraw GX extension is loaded and a printer is setup.

<P><LI>In the Visual FoxPro Command window, run the following code to create a
   new table and add a blank record to it:
<P>
<P><PRE>     CREATE TABLE test.dbf (descript C(10), olefield G)
     APPEND BLANK
     MODIFY GENERAL olefield
</PRE>
<P><LI>At this point, the general field should be open. From the Edit menu,
   choose the Insert Object command and create a new Microsoft Equation 2.0
   object. If Microsoft Equation 2.0 is not in the list of objects that can
   be created, it is either not installed or has not been registered with
   the System software. To register it, double-click the Equation Editor
   icon in the Microsoft folder then quit once it comes up.

<P><LI>Equation Editor should now appear with a dialog box titled "Equation in
   Test.olefield." If the toolbar is not visible, select it from the View
   menu. Then from the toolbar, click on a tool and select a symbol from
   the drop-down list that is displayed. Select a few symbols if desired.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Update and then choose Quit to go back to
   Visual FoxPro.

<P><LI>Close the general field in Visual FoxPro.

<P><LI>Create a new report in Visual FoxPro.

<P><LI>Add the Test.dbf to the report's DataEnvironment. From the
   DataEnvironment, drag the olefield from the Test table into the detail
   band of the report. This should create a Report Picture field. Size it
   as desired.

<P><LI>Save the report as Test.frx and close it.

<P><LI>Try to print the report by typing the following command in the Visual
<P><PRE>    FoxPro Command window:
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       REPORT FORM test TO PRINT
