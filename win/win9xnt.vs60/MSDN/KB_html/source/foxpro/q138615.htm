The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
At design time, you may switch between objects in the Form Designer by
using the Object list located at the top of the Properties window. However,
selecting a different form in a formset from this list does not make the
selected form the topmost window in the Form Designer.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 

<UL><LI>Switch between Forms by using the Form list located in the lower-left
   corner of the Form Designer.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>If a portion of the form is visible in the Form Designer, click the
   exposed portion to bring it to the front.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>If you have only one formset open, press CTRL+F6 to cycle through the
   forms in the Form Designer.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft is researching this behavior and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Open or switch to Microsoft Visual FoxPro and create a formset that
   consists of two or more forms.

<P><LI>Right-click the Form, and open the Properties window.

<P><LI>Using the Object list located in the Properties window, attempt to
   change the focus from one form to another. Note that regardless of the
   form selected, the topmost form in the Form Designer does not change.
