The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In FoxPro version 2.x, programmatic manipulation within a report is
accomplished by placing a user-defined function (UDF) within an expression
of a field object. The proper execution of the code, in many cases, depends
on where the field object resides on the report because report expressions
are evaluated from left to right and top to bottom.
<P>
Visual FoxPro includes "band expressions" that are called On Entry and On
Exit. These expressions can be found for each report band. The expressions
are evaluated once per band on each page of the report. Band Expressions
eliminate the need for careful placement of field objects to control when
the code is executed. By double-clicking a report band, you can access the
the On Entry and On Exit expressions. This article shows by example how to
use band expressions.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Step-by-Step Example</h3>
 
<P>
The following example demonstrates what happens when you place code in the
On Entry expression:

<OL><P><LI>Issue the command SET DEFAULT TO SYS(2004)+"\SAMPLES\DATA"

<P><LI>Use the Customer table.

<P><LI>In the Command window, issue this command:
<P>
   CREATE REPORT BANDTEST.

<P><LI>Populate the report by doing a Quick Report.

<P><LI>Double-click the Detail band and enter BandTest() in the On Entry field.
   In the Expression Builder, do not attempt to verify this expression.

<P><LI>Create a new program containing the following code, and name it
   BANDTEST.PRG:
<P>
   Wait Window "Record Number: " + Alltrim(Str(RecNo()))

<P><LI>Preview the report by right-clicking the report and choosing Preview.
<P>
</OL>Notice that the code is excuted before entering the Detail band and before
any data from the Detail band is displayed. If this code was placed in the
On Exit expression, it would have executed on leaving the Detail band.
