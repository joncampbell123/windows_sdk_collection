The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Using the Dock method of the ToolBar class, you can cause the toolbar
to dock automatically when the formset is displayed.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To have a toolbar that was added to your formset automatically dock when
the formset is run, place code in the Init event of the toolbar to call the
Dock method to dock the toolbar.
<P>
Either of the following commands can be placed in the Init event of the
toolbar to force the toolbar to dock at the top of the screen:
<P>
<PRE>   This.Dock(0)

   -or-

   ThisFormSet.&lt;name property of toolbar object&gt;.Dock(0)

</PRE>You can also dock the toolbar to the left, right, top, bottom, or a set
of coordinates by using a different number or set of numbers. To undock
the toolbar, use the -1 parameter, as in this example:
<P>
<PRE>   This.Dock(-1)

</PRE>For information on how to add a toolbar to your form or formset, please
refer to page 345 of the "Microsoft Visual FoxPro Developer's Guide," in
the "Adding Custom Toolbars to Form Sets" section.
<P>
You can also drag a toolbar that you have created from your project's
Classes tab to the form. If the form is not a formset, a dialog box will
appear that asks:
<P>
<PRE>   A formset object is required to add a form. Create one?

</PRE>Clicking Yes will create the necessary formset, and you will have a form
with a toolbar.
<P>
<P><h3>Syntax of the Dock Method</h3>
 
<P>
ToolBar.Dock [nLocation [, X, Y]]
<P>
nLocation - Specifies where the ToolBar is docked. The values for
<PRE>            nLocation are:

Value   Constant         Description
</PRE> 
<UL><LI>1    TOOL_NOTDOCKED   Undocks the Toolbar.
<PRE>   0    TOOL_TOP         Docks the toolbar at the top of the main Visual
                         FoxPro window.
   1    TOOL_LEFT        Docks the toolbar at the left side of the main
                         Visual FoxPro window.
   2    TOOL_RIGHT       Docks the toolbar at the right side of the main
                         Visual FoxPro window.
   3    TOOL_BOTTOM      Docks the toolbar at the bottom of the main Visual
                         FoxPro window.
X, Y                     Specifies the horizontal and vertical coordinates
                         of the docked position of the toolbar.

</PRE></UL>When a toolbar is docked, its title bar is hidden and its border is changed
to a single line. The toolbar is also resized to a single row of buttons.
The window is resized so that the toolbar does not obscure any information
on the screen.
<P>
For example, if the toolbar is docked at the top, the screen is moved down
by the height of the toolbar. Use the Move method to undock a toolbar. When
using the Move method, specify coordinates that lie outside the dock area.
