SUMMARY
 
<P>
Many Microsoft Windows-based applications display a message with
title, copyright, and version information while a program is starting.
This is primarily to make a slow initialization seem faster. It is
possible to accomplish this same technique with FoxPro.
<P>
MORE INFORMATION
 
<P>
To create your screen, use the screen generator to create a screen
that has the desired information. Normally, this includes information
about copyright, version, user identification, and title. It can also
include identifying graphics such as the application icon.
<P>
To set the attributes for the screen, choose the Window Style push
button in the Screen Layout dialog box. A typical startup message
screen in FoxPro should be defined as type User with a single line
border. It is not necessary for the screen to include a title bar.
Also, provide a name for the startup message screen in the box
provided in the Screen Layout dialog box in order to control the
window from the program.
<P>
This screen only needs to be displayed for a short time during startup
and needs to be removed without user intervention. To accomplish this,
include the #NOREAD generator directive in the SETUP code of the
screen file. This will prevent a READ clause from being added to the
screen program.
<P>
Save the screen without the environment settings and generate. This
will prevent the screen from opening and closing any files during
execution.
<P>
During the beginning portion of a program before menus get run,
databases opened, and environment variables initialized, include a
line to run the screen like the following:
<P>
<PRE>   DO OPENING.SPR

</PRE>When the initialization process has completed, issue the following
command:
<P>
<PRE>   RELEASE WINDOW &lt;windowname&gt;

</PRE>This command will remove the startup message screen and continue
normal execution of the program.
<P>
On some faster computers, the screen may flash by so fast that the
user will not be able to read it. A different technique must be
allowed to work around these undesirable results.
<P>
Instead of implementing this with the #NOREAD generator directive, use
the #READCLAUSES generator directive to add a TIMEOUT clause to the
READ command that is created by GENSCRN.PRG.
<P>
In the SETUP code for the screen, add a line similar to the following:
<P>
<PRE>   #READCLAUSES TIMEOUT 3

</PRE>When you add a line to DO this screen during the beginning portion of
your program, it will display for three seconds before being cleared.
