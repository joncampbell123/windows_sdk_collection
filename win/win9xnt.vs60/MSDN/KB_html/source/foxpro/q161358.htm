The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When a local view performing a Right Outer Join executes, the result set in
the view's Browse shows .NULL. in all of the left-side table's fields where
there is an unmatched row in the right-side table. If the view is defined
with an updateable left-side table when data is entered into the primary
key field of that table and the record pointer is moved, an information
message box shows the error "Update conflict" with the "OK," "Revert," and
"Help" options.
<P>
If data is entered into any of the other fields, you receive a "Syntax
error" message. You can remove this by issuing the following command:
<P>
<PRE>   =TableRevert(.T.)

</PRE>If you modify only the primary key field and the "Update error" message
appears, and if you click Revert, the row again shows .NULL. for all the
fields in the left table portion of that row.
<P>
If you click OK, the command " = TableUpdate(0,.T.)" (without the quotes)
is issued and that row in the view is marked as deleted.
<P>
If, then, the command "SET DELETED ON" is issued, the row disappears from
the view. It reappears with the command "SET DELETED OFF."
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The NULL row in the view is a "virtual row" with no correspondent in the
base left-side table. If a forced update based only on the Primary Key
fails, it indicates that the base-table row is inaccessible (as is the
virtual row in the view). In this case Visual FoxPro deletes the
conflicting row from the view. Because of the soft delete mechanism in
Visual FoxPro, the user can control the visibility of deleted rows via the
command SET DELETED ON /OFF.
<P>
Attempting to fill in the fields in the view from the left-side base table
would require performing an INSERT... SQL for the full corresponding row in
the left-side table.
