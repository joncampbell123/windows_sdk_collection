The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS, versions 2.5x, 2.6, 2.6a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft directly supports FoxPro for MS-DOS running under Microsoft MS-
DOS versions 3.1 and later. We make no guarantee, however, that FoxPro for
MS-DOS will run under operating systems other than MS-DOS, such as OS/2.
This article provides information that may help you configure FoxPro for
MS-DOS to run under OS/2 version 2.1.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Provide a "clean" MS-DOS box with DPMI-compliant memory.
<P>
OS/2 version 2.1 has "session settings" that are similar to Windows PIF
files. The items below are settings that may help improve the stability of
FoxPro for MS-DOS under OS/2 version 2.1.
<P>
<PRE>   set DPMI to 6 (use a reasonable number such as 6-10 megabytes)

   -or-

   set DPMI to automatic

   -or-

   set DPMI to 64 (set to a high number [megabytes])

      Memory will only be taken by FoxPro when requested; thus there will
      be  memory available for other applications. This differs from how
      FoxPro works  when running under MS-DOS. Setting this to high number
      ensures that FoxPro will see all  your memory.

   set EMS to 0-2048

         0 is preferred but 2048 has been known to help with stability.

   set XMS to 0

   set DOS high

   set IDLE_SENSITIVITY to 100

      NOTE: This setting seems to improve FoxPro's performance, but it
      slows everything else down.

</PRE><h3>Other Tips for Increasing Stability</h3>
 
<P>
Do not run FoxPro for MS-DOS in a "seamless OS/2" window, as this causes
problems. (These problems may be machine dependent.) Running FoxPro for
MS-DOS full-screen improves stability.
<P>
If stability has not improved, determine if FoxPro was installed directly
under OS/2. If it was, boot to MS-DOS and reinstall. Once reinstalled,
restart OS/2, configure FoxPro for MS-DOS with the above session settings,
and try again.
<P>
If stability problems persist, contact IBM's OS/2 support.
<P>
OS/2 is manufactured by IBM, a vendor independent of Microsoft; we make no
warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's performance or
reliability.
