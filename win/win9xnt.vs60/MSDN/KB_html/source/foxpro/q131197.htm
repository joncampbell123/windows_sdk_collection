The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When, after doing a functional conversion of a FoxPro screen in Visual
FoxPro version 3.0, the objects in that screen cannot be selected by
clicking them in the Visual FoxPro form.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Doing a functional conversion causes Visual FoxPro to add a Page frame to
the form. All of the objects in the form are put into the page frame
instead of directly onto the form.
<P>
By clicking the form, you are selecting the page frame object instead of
each individual object.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To be able to edit an individual object, click the page frame using the
secondary (right) mouse button. Then select Edit from the control menu. Or
you can select page1 from the object menu in the property box for the form.
Then you can click any item to change or view its properties and methods.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This Behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When creating a new form in Visual FoxPro version 3.0, you can click the
object to view or change its properties and methods. In FoxPro version 2.x,
you can edit an object by double-clicking it.
<P>
When you convert a screen from FoxPro version 2.x to Visual FoxPro version
3.0, Visual FoxPro adds a page frame to the form. The addition of a page
frame was necessary to emulate the FoxPro version 2.x READ model; the page
frame is a container that holds the converted objects. Clicking an object
in the form lists the properties and methods of the page frame instead of
the converted object.
<P>
NOTE: Performing a visual conversion instead of the functional conversion
prevents the page frame from being added to the form. The converted objects
are placed directly on the form. However, the properties and methods of the
objects must be manually added to the form.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Open a FoxPro version 2.x screen by choosing Open from the File menu or
   by using the MODIFY FORM command in the Command Window.

<P><LI>When the Visual FoxPro Converter dialog box appears, choose Functional
   Conversion, and click Continue.

<P><LI>When the form designer window appears, notice that the properties sheet
   has Formset as the default object.

<P><LI>Click any object on the form to list the properties and methods for
   the page frame. Double-Click to bring up the PageFrame.AddObject edit
   window.
<P></OL>
