<P>
This article documents the steps followed by the Catalog Manager when it is
needs to search for a wizard file. Knowledge of the manner in which the
Catalog Manager searches for wizard files can be helpful when
troubleshooting behavioral problems.

<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When a wizard is invoked from within the Catalog Manager, the Catalog
Manager must invoke WIZARD.APP. Once WIZARD.APP is invoked by the Catalog
Manager, it will invoke the desired wizard. The Catalog Manager follows
these steps when it needs to invoke WIZARD.APP:

<OL><P><LI>Look for an entry in the resource file where the ID field contains
   "CATALOG" and the Name field contains "WIZARD.APP Path".

<P><LI>Then do one of the following, depending on whether the entry exists:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - If the entry described in step 1 exists, search for WIZARD.APP in the
      location specified in the Data field. If WIZARD.APP exists at the
      location specified in the Data field, WIZARD.APP will be invoked. If
      WIZARD.APP does not exist at the location specified in the Data
      field, look for WIZARD.APP in the SYS(2004)+'\Wizards' directory. If
      WIZARD.APP exists in that location, the Catalog Manager will update
      the path to the WIZARD.APP file that is stored in the program field
      and will invoke WIZARD.APP. If WIZARD.APP does not exist in the
      SYS(2004)+'\Wizards' directory, the LOCFILE() dialog box will be
      invoked. If the user points to the location of the file for the
      desired wizard using the LOCFILE() dialog box, the resource file
      entry described in step 1 will then be created and the path to the
      file that was selected by the user will be stored in the program
      field.
