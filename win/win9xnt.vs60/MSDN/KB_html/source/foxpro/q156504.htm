The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Each time you drag and drop a field from a View to a Form or Report, the
View is requeried.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The information for the view is not cached; it is dynamically retrieved as
needed.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Issue the USE command to open the view first. Then when you drag and drop
fields, Intellidrop is able to get the information from the view that is
already open.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Open the Testdata database in the Visual FoxPro Samples\Data folder.

<P><LI>Create a new report.

<P><LI>In the DataEnvironment of the report, add the Invoice view from the
   Testdata database.

<P><LI>Drag a field from the view in the DataEnvironment to the Report Design
   Surface.

<P><LI>Drag another field from the view in the DataEnvironment to the Report
   Design Surface.
<P>
</OL>When the first field is dragged, the view is prompted for a dStart_Date and
dEnd_Date. When the second field is dragged, the view is prompted to the
same query again.
<P>
Here are the steps to a workaround for the above example:

<OL><P><LI>Open the Testdata database in the Visual FoxPro Samples\Data folder.

<P><LI>In the Command window type USE Invoice to open the view.(You are
   prompted for a dStart_Date and dEnd_Date.)

<P><LI>Create a new Report.

<P><LI>In the DataEnvironment of the Report, add the Invoice view from the
   TESTDATA Database.

<P><LI>Drag a field from the view in the DataEnvironment to the Report Design
   Surface. Drag another field from the view in the DataEnvironment
   to the Report.
<P>
</OL>The view does not prompt for the query again and again as shown in the
above example.
<P>
NOTE: The dialog box prompts for a Date type value. If you enter the date
as a text string "07/01/93"(without the quotes) an "Operator/operand type
mismatch" error is received. You must enter the dates in the following
manner: {07/01/93}
