The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.6 and 2.6a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After you create a popup from an array that has strings as elements, if a
element has an ampersand (&amp;) in the string's text, the ampersand displays
as "_" (an underscore) instead of "&amp;" in the selected item box of the
popup. For example, if the array element was "TEST1 &amp; TEST2", it would
display in the selected item box as "TEST1 _TEST2" when selected.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is caused by a feature of Windows. In Windows, an ampersand
indicates that the next character should be underlined; therefore, this
behavior also occurs in FoxPro for Windows.
<P>
To display an ampersand in Windows, you have to use two ampersands (for
example, &amp;&amp; Text). However, this workaround cannot be used in FoxPro
because a double ampersand indicates that the following text is a comment
and FoxPro should ignore the rest of the line, which usually generates a
syntax error.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
The best resolution for this is not to use ampersands in popups,
whether from arrays or lists. The reason for this is that the behavior
of some of the workarounds is unreliable and unpredictable.
<P>
One workaround that could be acceptable for short popups is to
create the popup from a list.
<P>
To do this,  initialize a variable in the Setup code for
each item that needs to contain an ampersand, and then put the variable
in the prompt for the popup using macro substitution.
For example, in the Setup code, place this line of code:
<P>
<PRE>   myvar="TEST1 &amp;"+"&amp; TEST2"

</PRE>And in the popup prompt's list, enter the variable preceeded by an
ampersand(for macro substitution)
<P>
<PRE>   &amp;myvar

</PRE>Items in the list that do not contain ampersands do not need to be placed
in variables. The problem with this resolution is that the items on the
list show two ampersands, not just one. But the display value just shows
one. Both ampersands get stored to the popup's variable.
<P>
There is not a good solution for this issue if the popup is from an array
and some of the array elements contain text with ampersands. Changing these
elements as above can be tried.

      test(2)="TEST3 &amp; TEST4"
</PRE>
<P><LI>Select the Popup tool from the toolbox and place a popup on the
   screen.

<P><LI>In the Popup dialog box, select Array Popup and type "test"
   (without the quotation marks).

<P><LI>In the Variable box, type "x" (without the quotation marks), and
   then choose OK.

<P><LI>From the Program menu, choose Generate.

<P><LI>Save the changes as ZTEST.SCX.

<P><LI>After ZTEST.SPR has been generated, type the following command in
   the Command window:
<P>
<P><PRE>      DO ztest.spr
</PRE>
<P><LI>Select TEST3 &amp; TEST4 from the popup. Note that it displays as
   TEST3 _TEST4.
