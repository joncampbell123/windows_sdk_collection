The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, version 2.6a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
After a user installs an executable on the destination Macintosh, he or she
is not prompted to install the Apple Shared Library Manager. Page 9 of the
Macintosh Distribution Kit manual states that the user will be prompted.
This is not correct. You must supply the user with ASLM diskette, and you
must instruct the user to install this diskette separately after installing
the executable.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If an application requires the use of a library file (MLB), the ASLM must
be installed on the system. Installing the ASLM modifies the system and
places the Shared Library Manager in the extensions folder. You need to
obtain a license for ASLM from Apple.
<P>
If an application uses a library file (MLB) that file needs to be placed in
the folder with the executable before running the setup wizard to create
the executable. The setup program will then place that MLB in the extension
folder.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create a project, and add the FOXTOOLS.MLB.

<P><LI>Create the executable.

<P><LI>Place the executable and FOXTOOLS.MLB in a new folder.

<P><LI>Create a new folder to hold the output of the Setup Wizard.

<P><LI>Run the Setup Wizard to create the floppy disks.

<P><LI>Run Setup on disk 1 on a computer that does not have FoxPro installed.
   The setup program installs the executable and places FOXTOOLS.MLB in the
   extensions folder, but it doesn't prompt you to install ASLM as stated
   in the manual on page 9.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: If you do not have a Macintosh available with a clean system, you can
install a second system on the same Macintosh by following these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Rename the current system folder on the hard drive.

<P><LI>Place the original system diskette or CD in the drive, and copy the
   system folder to the hard drive.

<P><LI>Drag the finder out of the original system folder to the desktop and
   restart the Macintosh. The new System Folder will now be the active
   system folder.
<P>
</OL>If the System Switcher utility is available, you can use it to switch
between the two folders. Then you won't have to remove the finder from the
original folder. When using the Switcher, a search should be done first to
locate all the possible system folders.
