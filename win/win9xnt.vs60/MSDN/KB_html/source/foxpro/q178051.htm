The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you change the Alias property of a cursor in the Data Environment of a
report or form that was created with the Quick Report or Quick Form
command, a dialog box appears many times with the following:
<P>
<PRE>   Outstanding references to &lt;old alias name&gt; exist.
   Would you like them automatically changed to &lt;new alias name&gt;.
     &lt;Yes&gt;     &lt;No&gt;     &lt;Cancel&gt;

</PRE>Unless the dialog box is moved, it may appear that the command buttons are
not functioning since multiple dialog boxes appear one on top of the other.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Continue to click the command button until the dialog box closes.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed
at the beginning of this article. We are researching this bug and will post
new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 
<P>
The problem occurs in both forms and reports, but the dialog box appears
more times in reports. The instructions below are for reproducing the
problem in a report. The steps for reproducing the behavior in a form are
basically the same.

<OL><P><LI>Run the following lines of code from the Visual FoxPro Command window to
   open a table and create a new report:
<P>
<P><PRE>      USE HOME()+"samples\data\employee"
      CREATE REPORT
</PRE>
<P><LI>From the Report menu, select the Quick Report command. After verifying
   that the Add alias and Add table to data environment check boxes are
   selected, click OK.

<P><LI>Open the Data Environment for the report. To do this, select Data
   Environment from the View menu or right-click the report and select Data
   Environment.

<P><LI>In the Data Environment, select the employee table. Right-click the
   table and select Properties.

<P><LI>The Alias property should be selected when the Properties sheet appears,
   with Employee as the value. Change the Alias property to TEST or
   anything else reasonable and press Enter.

<P><LI>The dialog box described above in the SYMPTOMS section should appear.
   Click the title bar and move it. Another copy of the title bar should be
   visible underneath the first copy. Click Cancel in the active copy of
   the dialog box. Repeat the selection until the dialog box closes. The
   number of times the dialog box appears varies. Similar behavior happens
   if either Yes or No is clicked instead of Cancel.
