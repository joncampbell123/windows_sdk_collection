The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Since Visual FoxPro for Macintosh does not create stand-alone executables
as FoxPro 2.6 did, AppleScript will not be able to directly call the
executable with the TELL statement. This behavior occurs because the
executable will require the use of one of the Visual FoxPro Support Library
files to run. AppleScript will have to TELL the Visual FoxPro Support
Library.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The sample AppleScript below will TELL the Visual FoxPro Support Library to
open a Visual FoxPro executable named "MyProgram.exe" that is located in
the MyApps folder on the Macintosh HD, activate it, and then have it
display a Wait Window containing the text "Hello World!":
<P>
<PRE>   tell application "VFP Support Library PPC"
      open "Macintosh HD:MyApps:MyProgram.Exe"
      activate
      Do Script "WAIT WINDOW 'Hello World!'"
   end tell

</PRE>Note that the Visual FoxPro executable must have a READ EVENTS in it so it
does not quit as soon as it is finished launching.
<P>
The main program of the MyProgram.Exe file should contain code similar to
the following:
<P>
<PRE>   \* kbon
        Do Mymenu.mpr
        READ EVENTS
   \* kboff

</PRE>The Mymenu.mpr program has an option to CLEAR EVENTS to allow the
executable to be exited. For more information on READ EVENTS and CLEAR
EVENTS, see Microsoft Visual FoxPro Online Help.
