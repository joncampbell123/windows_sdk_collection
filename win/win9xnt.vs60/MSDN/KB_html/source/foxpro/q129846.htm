The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Professional Edition of Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows,
   version 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Earlier versions of FoxPro relied on FOXDOC.APP to document applications.
Visual FoxPro no longer includes FOXDOC.APP; is has Documenting wizard
that you can use to document applications. This article describes the
Documenting wizard and how to use it.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Documenting Wizard</h3>
 
<P>
The Documenting wizard documents projects and program files. The wizard can
also create an analysis of your code and clean up the formatting in your
files. The Documenting Wizard is included only with the Professional
Edition of Visual FoxPro.
<P>
By default, the wizard does not modify your existing files. However, you
can choose to do this in the final step. The wizard prompts you as you go
through these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Source File: Enter the name of a project file or a specific program
   file.

<P><LI>Capitalization: Keywords are all the reserved words in the Visual FoxPro
   programming language. Symbols are the variables and names that you
   define in your code.

<P><LI>Indentation: Select the desired options to enforce conformity in the
   indentation of your code.

<P><LI>Headings: Headings are comments about the code that are relevant to the
   code they precede. They can be placed at the beginning of files,
   procedures, class definitions, and methods to make your formatted code
   easier to read.

<P><LI>Reports: The reports that the wizard creates are actually text files.
   The wizard creates the following types of reports:
<P>
<PRE>      Report Type       File Name    Remarks
      ------------------------------------------------------------
      Action Diagram    project.ACT  Shows the hierarchical
                                     relations within your code. If
                                     you are not working with ASCII
                                     code page 1250 and ANSI code
                                     page 1252, see the directive
                                     "*# document ACTIONCHARS" in
                                     Customizing the Documenting
                                     Wizard.

      Cross-Reference   XREF.LST     Lists all the user-defined
                                     symbols.

      File Listing      FILES.LST    Lists all the files in the
                                     project.

      Source Code       project.LST  Puts all formatted code in a
                                     single Listing file.

      Tree Diagram      TREE.LST     Shows the procedure calling
                                     tree.

   The wizard also automatically creates the following files:

      File Name    Description
      --------------------------------------------------------------
      FILES.DBF    Table with a record for each file in the project.

      FDXREF.DBF   Table with a record for each instance of user
                   symbols in the code.

   The FDXREF.DBF file contains a field named Flag for identifying the
   keywords. The identifiers are as follows:

      Flag  Description
      -------------------------------------------------------------
      B     Base class
      C     Class name
      D     Defined PROC or FUNC (not method)
      F     Function call: myproc( ) or DO myproc
      K     Keyword
      M     Method definition
      N     Name of file
      O     Object
      P     Property of an object
      R     User symbol reference
      V     User symbols (variable) definition (PARA, PRIV, PUBL, DIME)

</PRE><P><LI>Finish.
<P>
</OL>By default, the wizard does not overwrite your existing files. Select the
Overwrite Existing Files option to overwrite your existing code files with
the new ones that the wizard saves.
<P>
If you select the Place Files In A Single Directory option and then click
Finish, the wizard prompts you to choose a single directory where it will
save all the files it creates.
<P>
If you select the Place Files In A New Directory Tree and then click
Finish, the wizard prompts you to choose a directory where it will create a
copy of the project's source tree. It then saves the new, formatted program
files in the appropriate directories of the new tree.
<P>
If you select the Cross-Reference Keywords option, the wizard adds records
to FDXREF.DBF for each instance of Visual FoxPro keywords in your code.
Depending on the size of your code, this option may enlarge FDXREF.DBF by a
large number of records. When this option is selected, the wizard matches
keywords in your code with the first field, named Token, in the file
FDKEYWRD.DBF. The second column, Code, in FDKEYWRD.DBF contains an
identifier that tells the wizard how to treat the keyword when analyzing
your code.
<P>
The following table describes the identifier codes:
<P>
<PRE>  Code   Description
  ---------------------------------------------------------
  I      Indent
  U      Undent (Remove indent)
  R      Reset indentation to 0 (or 1 if InDefineClass)
  F      Proc or function
  D      While or Case: DO clause
  O      Object (Spinner,CommandButton)
  P      Property (Scalemode,DecimalPoints)
  M      Method (Init,KeyPress)
  C      ClauseUsed only as a Clause: can't start a statement

</PRE></OL><h3>Customizing the Documenting Wizard</h3>
 
<P>
In addition to the options that you choose when running the Documenting
Wizard, you can customize additional options outside the wizard.
<P>
<P><h3>Indentation in CASE Structures</h3>
 
<P>
By default, the wizard looks for the following indentation in a CASE
structure:
<P>
<PRE>   DO CASE
   CASE case1=1
       case2=2
   CASE case3=3
       case4=4
   ENDCASE

</PRE>Some developers prefer to indent the lines between DO CASE and ENDCASE an
additional level as shown here:
<P>
<PRE>   DO CASE
       CASE case1=1
            case2=2
       CASE case3=3
            case4=4
   ENDCASE

</PRE>If you indent your CASE structures to look like the second example, specify
this in FDKEYWRD.DBF. To specify this coding style in FDKEYWRD.DBF, change
the value of the Code field to "UU" in the ENDCASE record.
<P>
<P><h3>Documenting Wizard Directives</h3>
 
<P>
You can place special directives in your code files to instruct the
Documenting wizard to perform specific tasks when analyzing the code. These
directives can go in two places. Place them in:
<P>
<PRE>  - Your project's main program file to instruct the wizard how to analyze
    all code files in the project.

  - Individual code files to instruct the wizard how to analyze specific
    files.

</PRE>Each directive begins with an asterisk, so Visual FoxPro treats them as
comments and ignores them when compiling programs. The directives are not
case-sensitive.
<P>
The syntax of the directives is:
<P>
<PRE>   *# document directive

</PRE>It is a good idea to place the directives near the beginning of the main
program file so that the Documenting wizard encounters the instruction when
it begins analyzing. The remaining sections in this article explain these
directives.
<P>
<P><h3>*# document ACTIONCHARS "abcdef"</h3>
 
<P>
By default, when the Documenting Wizard creates an Action Diagram or a Tree
Diagram, the wizard uses six characters that appear as lines and square
corners when viewed under ASCII code page 1250 or under ANSI code page 1252
in FoxFont. Not all the characters map to line characters when viewed under
other code pages.
<P>
The six default characters and their corresponding FoxFont characters are
listed below as a, b, c, d, e, and f.
<P>
<PRE>           Default        As viewed
  abcdef   Chr( ) Value   in FoxFont
  ----------------------------------------------------
  a        32             (space)
  b        196             -
  c        179             |
  d        218             Upper left corner bracket
  e        192             Lower left corner bracket
  f        195             Sideways "T" (similar to "|-")

</PRE>NOTE: The FoxFont characters needed for this table were not displayable in
this font, so a description of the characters was used instead.
<P>
When using other code pages, insert the following code in your main program
file to ensure that the lines in your diagrams map to line-like characters:
<P>
<PRE>   *# document ACTIONCHARS " -|+++"

</PRE>NOTE: Tthe first character of the string enclosed in quotation marks is a
space. For a list of supported code pages, please see the "Code Pages
Supported by Visual FoxPro" topic in the Visual FoxPro Help file.
<P>
<P><h3>*# document XREF cMode</h3>
 
<P>
This directive tells Visual FoxPro whether to enable cross-referencing of
variables. The default is ON.
<P>
<PRE>   cMode     Description
   ------------------------------------------------------------------------
   ON        enables cross referencing of variables
   OFF       disables cross-referencing of variables
   SUSPEND   Disables cross-referencing of variables in the current file
             until the Documenting wizard encounters the next instance
             of: *# document XREF ON

</PRE><h3>*# document EXPANDKEYWORDS cMode</h3>
 
<P>
This directive tells Visual FoxPro whether to enable the expansion of
keywords. For example, "DEFINE WIND" could be expanded to "DEFINE WINDOW."
The default is OFF.
<P>
WARNING: Not all keywords in Visual FoxPro begin with a unique string of
four characters. For example, "REPL" could be short for "REPLACE" or
"REPLICATE." Be careful if you include this directive, which will overwrite
existing files.
<P>
<PRE>   cMode     Description
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------
   ON        Enables keyword expansion
   OFF       Disables keyword expansion
   SUSPEND   Disables keyword expansion in the current file until the next
             instance of: *# document EXPANDKEYWORDS ON

</PRE><h3>*# document XREFKEYWORDS cMode</h3>
 
<P>
This directive corresponds to the Cross Reference Keywords option on "Step
6 - Finish" in the Documenting wizard. The default is OFF.
<P>
<PRE>  cMode     Description
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ON        Enables cross referencing of keywords
  OFF       Disables cross-referencing of keywords
  SUSPEND   Disables cross-referencing of keywords in the current file
            until the next instance of: *# document XREFKEYWORDS ON

</PRE><h3>*# document ARRAYBRACKETS cMode</h3>
 
<P>
The default is OFF.
<P>
<PRE>  cMode     Description
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  ON        The Documenting Wizard assumes that square brackets are used
            for arrays and that parentheses are used for functions and
            methods.

  OFF       The Documenting Wizard treats both square brackets and
            parentheses as arrays.

</PRE><h3>*# document ACTIONINDENTLENGTH nSpace</h3>
 
<P>
In this directive, nSpace is the number of character spaces that you want
the Documenting Wizard to use for indentation. The minimum value allowed
is 2.
