The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS, versions 2.5, 2.5a, and 2.5b
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Workstation Installation (INSTALL /N) option is run from a directory
containing an Administrative Installation. The Workstation Installation
consists of two parts -- Basic Installation and Configuration.
<P>
The Basic portion copies FOX.EXE to the Workstation directory and adds the
Workstation and Administrative directories to the PATH statement in
AUTOEXEC.BAT.
<P>
The Configuration portion runs the FoxPro application, ADDUSER.APP, which
creates configuration and resource files in the Workstation directory, and
then adds a SET FOXPROCFG statement to the AUTOEXEC.BAT.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
NOTE: Before performing a Workstation Installation, an Administrative
Installation must be available. The Administrative Installation (INSTALL
/A) copies and expands all files to the Administrative directory. These
files are used by FoxPro when it is running on a workstation.
<P>
Additional information on network installation is contained in INSTALL.TXT,
found on the Setup disk (Disk 1) and in the main FoxPro directory (usually
FOXPRO25).
<P>
<P><h3>Basic Installation</h3>
 
<P>
The Basic Installation option does the following:

<OL><P><LI>Asks you for the installation directory. You can use the default
   directory provided, or specify a different one, which is created if it
   doesn't already exist.
<P>
   The default directory is FOXPRO25 on the current drive. For example, if
   the current drive is N, the default directory is N:\FOXPRO25.
<P>
   NOTE: You can also specify the installation directory at the command
   line by including the directory name after typing INSTALL /N. For
   example, to make the installation directory C:\FOX, type the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      INSTALL /N C:\FOX
</PRE>
<P><LI>Prompts you to add the directories containing the Workstation and
   Administrative Installations of FoxPro to the AUTOEXEC.BAT file's PATH
   statement if they are not already in the PATH statement.

<P><LI>Makes a backup of the AUTOEXEC.BAT file if you instructed the
   installation program to make changes to the PATH statement in the
   previous step. A backup of the AUTOEXEC.BAT file is saved to
   AUTOEXEC.000. If, AUTOEXEC.000 already exists, the backup is saved to
   AUTOEXEC.001 (and so on).

<P><LI>Copies FOX.EXE to the installation directory.

<P><LI>Asks if you want to configure FoxPro for your particular network
   environment. If you do not want to do this, press the ESC key. To
   proceed, press any other key.
<P>
</OL><h3>Configuration</h3>
 
<P>
If you chose to configure FoxPro for your particular network environment
(step 5 above), the installation program calls INSTALL2.BAT to start the
FoxPro ADDUSER.APP application. INSTALL2.BAT is created by INSTALL /N, and
contains the name of the current installation directory. In this example,
INSTALL2.BAT contains the following line:
<P>
<PRE>   FOX -ek adduser.app N:\FOXPRO25\

</PRE></OL>The ADDUSER.APP application asks for information used to create the
configuration file (CONFIG.FP by default), which is saved in the
Workstation directory.
<P>
Then ADDUSER.APP adds a SET FOXPROCFG=&lt;configuration pathname&gt; statement to
the AUTOEXEC.BAT file.
<P>
For more information about ADDUSER.APP, query on the following word here in
