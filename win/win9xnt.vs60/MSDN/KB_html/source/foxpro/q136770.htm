<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
One way to optimize the amount of network traffic a multiuser application
generates is to minimize the volume of file hits to server-based files.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To build a multiuser database application that minimizes network traffic,
consider the fact that the fewer the number of times your application has
to process server-based files, the less network traffic is generated.
<P>
Techniques for reducing network traffic incorporate local-caching
strategies and dynamic usage systems that pull network files into use only
when absolutely necessary. This requires overhead programming, but it can
result in a much more stable, speedy, and reliable network connection.
<P>
In a database application, users often need to see only a subset of the
data. In this case, a query to bring what the user needs down into a local
table for manipulation is appropriate. Once the information is local, there
is no further need to access the network until a change is committed.
<P>
Whenever you implement a scheme like this, you need to have an effective
way to handle transaction processing. For more information about
transaction processing, please see the "Managing Updates with Transactions"
section, pages 440-447, the "Programming for Shared Access" chapter of the
"Developer's Guide."
<P>
Optimizing network traffic requires that you reference network files as
few times as possible, and close these files when your application is
finished with them for a while. It is better to work with local data sets
and verify synchronization issues.
<P>
For additional information, please see Chapter 4, page 71, of the
"Professional Features Guide."
