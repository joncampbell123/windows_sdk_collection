The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5, 2.5a, 2.5b, 2.6
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Printing a mixture of Hairline and 1 Point boxes or lines with the Report
Writer does not work correctly with the HP LaserJet 4/4M V. 1.20 driver
included with Windows for Workgroups version 3.11.
<P>
If Hairline and 1 Point objects are both used in the Report Detail band,
objects in the first Detail band will print properly, but in subsequent
Detail bands will print as all Hairline or all 1 Point objects, depending
on which occurs first in the Detail band.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This is a function of which Pen type appears uppermost in the Detail
band and applies to lines and boxes. The Pen type that is uppermost in
the Detail band will predominate in subsequent printing of the Detail
band.
<P>
Objects of Pen Point sizes of 2, 4, and 6 print correctly if mixed with
objects that are Hairline or 1 Point in the Detail band.
<P>
Hairline or 1 Point objects in the headers affect which object predominates
in the Detail band. If a 1 Point object appears in the Page Header,
regardless of other objects in the Page Header, the Hairline and 1 Point
objects will appear as 1 Point in all Detail bands after the first, which
prints properly. If a Hairline object appears in the Header without a 1
Point object, the Hairline and 1 Point objects print correctly in the first
Detail band, but will be all Hairline in subsequent Detail bands.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 

<UL><LI>Upgrade the HP LaserJet 4 driver to version 1.35 or later.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Upgrade to FoxPro version 2.6a for Windows.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in
FoxPro version 2.60a for Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create a Quick Report from SALESMAN.DBF in the TUTORIAL subdirectory.

<P><LI>Drag the lower Detail band separator bar downward to create an
   additional line in the Detail band.

<P><LI>Move a field to the second line of the Detail band.

<P><LI>Place a box around the fields in the first line of the Detail band, and
   set the Pen (under the Object menu) to 1 Point.

<P><LI>Place a box around the field in the second line of the Detail band, and
   set the Pen to Hairline.

<P><LI>Send the REPORT FORM to the printer.

<P><LI>Look at the lower box in the Detail band in the printed output. It will
   appear as Hairline only in the first printing of the Detail band. All
   other Detail bands will contain both boxes as 1 Point.
