<PRE>    FoxPro for MS-DOS?
</PRE>2   I have an existing FoxPro 2.0 project. How do I
<PRE>    enable it to run in FoxPro version 2.5?

</PRE> 
<P>
Question 1
<P>
Can I create a FoxPro for Windows application using
FoxPro for MS-DOS?
<P>
Answer 1
<P>
FoxPro for Windows can execute applications you create
with FoxPro for MS-DOS without you making any changes to
the applications. The FoxPro for MS-DOS power tools,
however, don't support features that are specific to the
Windows environment. You can write your own code to add
these Windows features, but we don't recommend this
approach to cross-platform application development.
 
<P>
Question 2
<P>
I have an existing FoxPro 2.0 project. How do I enable it
to run in FoxPro version 2.5?
<P>
Answer 2
<P>
You open the project in FoxPro version 2.5 and rebuild your
application. You must convert screens and reports only if
you decide to modify them.
 
<P>
Question 3
<P>
Will I be able to create executable files for FoxPro version
2.5?
<P>
Answer 3
<P>
Yes. The options for building .EXE files in FoxPro 2.5 for
MS-DOS are the same as in FoxPro 2.0. You can build
compact and stand-alone .EXE files. Compact .EXE files are
distributed with library files that are included in the
FoxPro Distribution Kit. Stand-alone .EXE files don't
require the FoxPro library files. The information from the
libraries is built into a stand-alone .EXE.
<P>
In FoxPro for Windows, you can create the equivalent of
the compact .EXE file. These files are distributed with
the library files included in the FoxPro for Windows
Distribution Kit.

</PRE> 
<P>
Question 1
<P>
Why do the windows created in FoxPro for Windows have
different style controls when compared with the windows in
FoxPro for MS-DOS?
<P>
Answer 1
<P>
FoxPro for Windows is designed to conform to the Windows
3.1 interface guidelines for applications. These
guidelines enable you to use the same methods of moving,
selecting, and changing windows with all Windows
applications. FoxPro windows now include Control-menu
boxes and Minimize, Maximize, and Restore buttons. For a
complete discussion of window styles and terminology,
refer to the Getting Started manual.
 
<P>
Question 2
<P>
What is the purpose of the Control-menu box at the
top left of FoxPro windows?
<P>
Answer 2
<P>
A single click in the Control-menu box displays the
Control menu, with which you can move, size, close, and
select windows. A double-click in the Control-menu box
closes the window.
 
<P>
Question 3
<P>
Why is it that I can resize some windows in FoxPro
and not others?
<P>
Answer 3
<P>
FoxPro for Windows contains both windows you can size and
windows you can't size. Windows that contain a text-
editing region are sizable. Examples of sizable windows
are the Command window, Screen Design window and the
Calendar. These windows may contain scroll bars and a
sizing box in the bottom right corner of the window.
Examples of windows you can't size include the View and
RQBE windows. Windows you can't size have only the
Control-menu box and the Minimize button.
 
<P>
Question 4
<P>
Why have the keyboard shortcuts in FoxPro for Windows
changed? Is there a way to restore the FoxPro for MS-DOS
style keystrokes?
<P>
Answer 4
<P>
FoxPro for Windows supports Windows-style keystrokes, such
as using Enter to choose a focused selection. FoxPro for
Windows supports both an MS-DOS keystroke mode and Windows
keystroke mode. Refer to the FoxPro online help for
details on the keystroke differences. You were asked at
installation time which mode to select. However, you can
change the mode interactively at any time in FoxPro by
issuing the command:
<P>
<PRE>   SET KEYCOMP TO DOS
</PRE>or
<PRE>   SET KEYCOMP TO WINDOWS

</PRE>Each time you load FoxPro, the default KEYCOMP setting
you specify during installation will be in effect. To
change the default setting of KEYCOMP, include the
appropriate statement the CONFIG.FPW file:
<P>
<PRE>   KEYCOMP=DOS
</PRE>or
<PRE>   KEYCOMP=WINDOWS
</PRE> 
<P>
Question 5
<P>
When I create a table and press Enter to add a new field
I find that the dialog unexpectedly closes. Why is this?
<P>
Answer 5
<P>
The keystroke navigation is different in Windows and
MS-DOS. In FoxPro for MS-DOS, the keystroke equivalent of
clicking the focus button is CTRL+ENTER. In Windows, it
is Enter. So pressing Enter in the Table Structure dialog
tells FoxPro you have chosen the OK button. To establish
the MS-DOS keystroke mode in Windows, issue the command
SET KEYCOMP TO DOS.
 
<P>
Question 6
<P>
FoxPro for Windows automatically displays a status bar
located at the bottom of the main window. Is it possible
to remove this status bar? Is the MS-DOS style status bar
available?
<P>
Answer 6
<P>
The Windows-style status bar displays the same information
as the MS-DOS-style status bar, plus information about the
currently selected menu name or command and messages you
create using FoxPro commands. It can also display the
system time.
<P>
The Windows-style status bar is displayed by default. To
remove the status bar, in the Command window issue the
command:
<P>
<PRE>   SET STATUS BAR OFF

</PRE>Alternatively, in CONFIG.FPW enter the item:
<P>
<PRE>   STATUS BAR = OFF

</PRE>To restore the status bar, substitute ON for OFF in
the previous two examples.
<P>
The SET MESSAGE TO command you use to specify a
message location is ignored when the Windows style status
bar is active. When the Windows-style status bar is
active, messages you create with commands such as DEFINE
MENU, DEFINE POPUP, DEFINE BAR, and @...PROMPT, appear in
the Windows-style status bar.
<P>
When the Windows-style status bar is active, to display
the time on the right hand side of the status bar
issue the following command:
<P>
<PRE>   SET CLOCK STATUS

</PRE>Alternatively, in CONFIG.FPW enter the item:
<P>
<PRE>   CLOCK = STATUS

</PRE>For compatibility with existing FoxPro 2.0 applications,
FoxPro for Windows displays the MS-DOS style status bar
when you issue the command SET STATUS ON.
 
<P>
Question 7
<P>
When I issue the command SET DISPLAY TO VGA50 and then
issue the command SET DISPLAY TO VGA25 to restore the
previous setting, the status bar disappears. How do I
restore the status bar?
<P>
Answer 7
<P>
Issue the SET STATUS BAR ON command.
 
<P>
Question 8
<P>
Why has the menu for FoxPro for Windows changed?
Is the MS-DOS version of the menu available?
<P>
Answer 8
<P>
The menu in FoxPro for Windows has been modified for
consistency with the standard Windows interface. The
System menu on the FoxPro 2.0 menu bar has been removed
and a number of specific menu items have been moved.
<P>
Take a moment to explore the new menu structure. Note that
a brief message describing each menu item is displayed in
the status bar at the bottom of the main FoxPro window.
<P>
If you are more comfortable with the menu bar layout of
FoxPro 2.0, you can run a distributed FoxPro menu program
that recreates it. Simply execute the DOS.MPR file
located in the GOODIES subdirectory with the DO command.
Running this menu program replaces the FoxPro for Windows
menu bar layout with the FoxPro for MS-DOS menu bar
layout while retaining the Text menu for multiple font
support.
<P>
To automatically display the FoxPro for MS-DOS menu bar
when you load FoxPro for Windows, place the following
item in the CONFIG.FPW file to execute the DOS.MPR
program:
<P>
<PRE>   COMMAND = DO C:\FOXPROW\GOODIES\DOS\DOS.MPR

</PRE>Modify the path specification for DOS.MPR based on your
specific installation.
 
<P>
Question 9
<P>
The Edit menu contains a number of new options such as
Paste Special... and Change Link... . How do I use these
options?
<P>
Answer 9
<P>
The new Edit menu options support Object Linking and
Embedding (OLE). The items include Paste Special, Insert
Object, Object, Change Link, and Convert to Static. For
a detailed discussion of OLE consult the FoxPro
documentation.
 
<P>
Question 10
<P>
The Program menu contains the new option, Beautify. What
does it do?
<P>
Answer 10
<P>
The Beautify option alters the appearance of program files
so they are easier to read. For example, you can choose to
alter the case of key words and variables, and to add
indentation within procedures and DO CASE statements.
You can also highlight program organization by
bracketing specific control statements such as:
<P>
<PRE>   IF
     DO something
   ELSE
     DO something
   ENDIF
</PRE> 
<P>
Question 11
<P>
The Text menu is completely new. What new features does
this menu offer?
<P>
Answer 11
<P>
The Text Menu adds support for multiple fonts and text
formatting. The Font option makes all of your installed
Windows fonts available within FoxPro. A Font option is
also available in the Browse menu for Browse windows.
<P>
To change the main FoxPro window font, hold down the
Shift key when you choose the Text menu pad. Then choose
the Screen Font... option.
<P>
The Enlarge Font and Reduce Font options change all text
to the next available point size in the current font. To
alter the spacing of the text, select the Single Space,
1 1/2 Space, or Double Space option.
<P>
The Indent option indents the selected group of lines one
tab stop. Undent does the opposite by moving a selected
group of lines out one tab stop.
 
<P>
Question 12
<P>
Occasionally the Object menu is available. When does it
display and why?
<P>
Answer 12
<P>
The Object menu is available when either the Screen
Builder or the Report Writer window is open. As with the
Text and Browse menus, the Object menu provides access to
fonts. Specific items on the Object menu are enabled and
disabled based on the currently selected object.
<P>
For example, a rectangle drawn in the Screen Design window
may have an outline or pen color, a background or fill
color, and a fill pattern.
 
<P>
Question 13
<P>
FoxPro for Windows includes Windows-style help. Is there
any way to access the .DBF-style help I used in Fox 2.0?
<P>
Answer 13
<P>
By default, FoxPro for Windows uses Windows-style help. To
access the .DBF-style help, issue the following command:
<P>
<PRE>   SET HELP TO FOXHELP.DBF

</PRE>Pressing F1 or choosing Contents from the menu will then
open .DBF-style help.
<P>
To return to the Windows-style help, issue the following
command:
<P>
<PRE>   SET HELP TO FOXHELP.HLP

</PRE>To change the default help to the .DBF-style help, add
this statement to your CONFIG.FPW file:
<P>
<PRE>   HELP = FOXHELP.DBF
</PRE> 
<P>
Question 14
<P>
Shouldn't a full path rather than just the drive letter
display when I issue the following command in the command
window?
<P>
<PRE>       ? SET("DEFAULT")

</PRE>Answer 14
<P>
No. This is consistent with FoxPro 2.0 for MS-DOS.
 
 
<P><h2>Part 3: Report Writer</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Overview of Questions</h3>
 
<P>
1   Should I convert all of my FoxPro 2.0 reports to
<PRE>    FoxPro for Windows format?
</PRE>2   I used the Quick Report option to create my initial
<PRE>    report. Now I want to add another field. In FoxPro
    for MS-DOS, the Report menu popup contained an option
    called Field... which allowed me to add a single
    field. What do I do in FoxPro for Windows?
</PRE>3   I have included a memo-type field in my report but
<PRE>    only the first line prints. How can I fix this?
</PRE>4   When I place a "stretched" memo field in the detail
<PRE>    band, I find that the fields which display below the
    memo field are being overwritten by some of the longer
    memo fields. How do I avoid this?
</PRE>5   I have placed boxes around several fields in my
<PRE>    report. One of these fields is a memo field. How do I
    make the box stretch to fit the memo field?
</PRE>6   When I attempt to move a text object to a specific
<PRE>    location in the Report Design window, the field keeps
    aligning itself with the nearest grid line. Why is
    this happening?
</PRE>7   How do I design and print multi-column reports in
<PRE>    FoxPro 2.5 for Windows?
</PRE>8   When I enlarge the font of objects in my report and
<PRE>    print it, some of the information in the fields is
    obscured. How can I fix this?
</PRE> 
<P>
Question 1
<P>
Should I convert all of my FoxPro 2.0 reports to FoxPro
for Windows format?
<P>
Answer 1
<P>
You may not need to. Your existing character reports will
run, preview, and print unchanged in FoxPro for Windows.
The engine for printing character reports is included in
FoxPro for Windows. If you want to include graphical
elements such as fonts and pictures in a report, then you
can convert the reports to FoxPro for Windows format, or
create new graphical reports from scratch.
 
<P>
Question 2
<P>
I used the Quick Report option to create my initial
report. Now I want to add another field. In FoxPro for
MS-DOS, the Report menu contained an option called
Field... which allowed me to add a single field. What do
I do in FoxPro for Windows?
<P>
Answer 2
<P>
You can add new fields by using the field tool
located in the toolbox on the left side of the Report
Design window. See the FoxPro for Windows User's Guide for
additional information on the Report Writer toolbox.
 
<P>
Question 3
<P>
I have included a memo-type field in my report but only
the first line prints. How can I fix this?
<P>
Answer 3
<P>
To display the entire contents of the memo field, you must
make the field stretch vertically to fit its contents.
Double-click the report field and select the Top - Field
Can Stretch option from the Position Relative To item.
This field will now enlarge depending on the length
of the memo field contents. Select the Page Preview option
to view the result.
 
<P>
Question 4
<P>
When I place a "stretched" memo field in the detail band,
I find that the fields which display below the memo field
are being overwritten by some of the longer memo fields.
How do I avoid this?
<P>
Answer 4
<P>
Fields or objects positioned below the memo field are
still being displayed in a fixed position even though the
memo field is now stretchable. To avoid being overwritten,
all objects below the memo field should be positioned
relative to the bottom of the Detail band. To accomplish
this, double-click on each of the fields and select the
Bottom option from the Position Relative To item. Select
the Page Preview option to view the result. If your report
contains side-by-side memo fields, fields with the Bottom
option specified will display below the longer of the two
memo fields.
<P>
Note: The previous procedure applies to non-stretching
fields and other objects, such as lines and text. If you
have stretching fields placed below other stretching
fields, you don't want to position them "relative to
bottom." Stretching fields automatically float below other
stretching fields.
 
<P>
Question 5
<P>
I have placed boxes around several fields in my report.
One of these fields is a memo field. How do I make the box
stretch to fit the memo field?
<P>
Answer 5
<P>
Double-click the box and select the Stretch With Band
option from the Position Relative To item. Rectangles
(boxes) and vertical lines can optionally stretch
according to the length of the Detail band.
<P>
Note:  You won't be able to place a stretching box around
a field if the field won't be positioned relative to
the top or the bottom of the band. Boxes must be
positioned relative to the top or bottom of the band.
 
<P>
Question 6
<P>
When I attempt to move a text object to a specific
location in the Report Design window, the field keeps
aligning itself with the nearest grid line. Why is this
happening?
<P>
Answer 6
<P>
By default, objects are automatically aligned to the
nearest invisible grid lines within the Report Design
window. This feature is called Snap to Grid and may be
disabled by deselecting the Snap to Grid option from the
Report menu.
 
<P>
Question 7
<P>
How do I design and print multi-column reports in FoxPro
2.5 for Windows?
<P>
Answer 7
<P>
Select Page Layout... from the Report menu option and use
the Columns spinner to select the number of columns.
Clicking the up arrow increases the counter value, and
clicking the down arrow decreases the counter value.
The size of the Report Design window reflects the new
column width, and you may need to modify existing field
positions.
<P>
Hint: When creating a new report that will have columns,
set the layout before you add any fields.
 
<P>
Question 8
<P>
When I enlarge the font of objects in my report and print
the report, some of the information in the fields is
obscured. How can I fix this?
<P>
Answer 8
<P>
You may need to stretch the detail lines and/or the
objects themselves to accommodate the larger font.
 
 
<P><h2>Part 4: Screen Builder</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Overview of Questions</h3>
 
<P>
1   I don't own a mouse. How can I create a screen using
<PRE>    the keyboard?
</PRE>2   The Field dialog in the Screen Design window allows me
<PRE>    to create only an input field or an output field.
    What happened to the Edit field option in the field
    dialog?
</PRE>3   When I select the push button tool in the Screen
<PRE>    Design window I have a choice of three button types:
    Normal, Invisible and Picture. Were these types
    available in FoxPro 2.0?
</PRE>4   I know how to click and drag objects within the Screen
<PRE>    Design window using the Selection pointer tool. Is
    there an easy way to move objects a small distance?
</PRE>5   I created a screen for my application which
<PRE>    displays a number of fields. After creating the
    application, when I move the cursor from one field to
    the next the order in which the cursor moves to the
    fields isn't what I expect based on the physical
    arrangement of the fields. How can I change the field
    access order without changing the physical position of
    the fields?
</PRE>6   When generating screens in FoxPro 2.0, I was able to
<PRE>    specify exactly what code to generate. Options
    included adding code to open and close files, define
    and release windows, and create modal screens. Is this
    option still available?
</PRE>7   The Color option is no longer on the Screen menu. How
<PRE>    do I specify colors for my screen objects?
</PRE>8   When I use an @... SAY statement to display
<PRE>    the contents of a general field, nothing appears. What
    am I doing wrong?
</PRE>9   I used the picture tool to add a picture field to my
<PRE>    screen and specified the appropriate .BMP file.
    Please explain in more detail how the options in
    the area called If Picture and Frame Different Size
    affect the display of the picture. The options are
    Clip Picture, Scale Picture - Retain Shape and Scale
    Picture - Fill the Frame.
</PRE>10  I want to create a screen that allows online editing,
<PRE>    while a READ is active, of OLE objects stored in a
    general field. When I add a picture to my screen
    using the picture tool, I'm not able to edit the
    displayed .BMP file. Is there a way to do this?
</PRE>11  Why can't I type as many characters into an input
<PRE>    field as it appears will fit?
</PRE>12  How do I control the length of a memory variable

<P>
Question 1
<P>
I don't own a mouse. How can I create a screen using the
keyboard?
<P>
Answer 1
<P>
A mouse is required to create a screen with the Screen
Builder.
 
<P>
Question 2
<P>
The Field dialog in the Screen Design window allows me to
create only an input field or an output field. What
happened to the Edit field option in the field dialog?
<P>
Answer 2
<P>
The edit field option is now part of the new Edit Region
dialog. To create an edit field, click the edit region
tool located on the left side of the Screen Design window.
Notice that as you select the tool a brief description
appears in the status bar at the bottom of the screen. In
the Edit Region dialog the options Select on Entry and
Initially Disable Edit Region are new. For additional
information on these options see the Edit Region Dialog
topic in Help.
 
<P>
Question 3
<P>
When I select the push button tool in the Screen Design
window I have a choice of three button types: Normal,
Invisible and Picture. Were these types available in
FoxPro 2.0?
<P>
Answer 3
<P>
FoxPro for Windows has consolidated the Invisible Button
and Push Button options into a single dialog. The Picture
type push button is new. You can create a picture push
button using a bitmap (.BMP) picture file to graphically
depict the action the push button represents. You can also
use picture files with radio buttons and check boxes in
FoxPro for Windows.
 
<P>
Question 4
<P>
I know how to click and drag objects within the Screen
Design window using the Selection pointer tool. Is there an
easy way to move objects a small distance?
<P>
Answer 4
<P>
Yes. Select the object to move using the Selection
pointer tool and use the arrow keys to move the object one
pixel at a time.
 
<P>
Question 5
<P>
I created a screen for my application which displays a
number of fields. After creating the application, when I
move the cursor from one field to the next the order in
which the cursor moves to the fields isn't what I expect
based on the physical arrangement of the fields. How can I
change the field access order without changing the
physical position of the fields?
<P>
<P>
Answer 5
<P>
To accomplish this, return to your original screen in the
Screen Design window. From the Screen menu, select the
Object Order... option. This option opens the Object Order
dialog, where screen objects are listed according to their
keyboard access order. To change the access order for the
objects, click the button to the left of the object and
drag the object to its new keyboard access position.
When you're done, rebuild your application to include
the new field access order.
 
<P>
Question 6
<P>
When generating screens in FoxPro 2.0, I was able to
specify what code to generate. Options included adding
code to open and close files, define and release windows,
and create modal screens. Is this option still available?
<P>
Answer 6
<P>
Yes. The Generate Screen dialog contains a More button.
Choose this button to view the generate code options.
 
<P>
Question 7
<P>
The Color option is no longer on the Screen menu. How do
I specify colors for my screen objects?
<P>
Answer 7
<P>
To specify colors, first select the object or a group of
objects. To modify the background color of the object
select Fill Color from the Object menu. To modify the
outline and text of an object, select Pen Color from the
Object menu.
<P>
The AUTOMATIC setting will match the Windows color sets.
<P>
To change the background of the entire screen, choose
Layout... from the Screen menu and click on the Color
option. You may choose a specific color or select a
wallpaper pattern by clicking Wallpaper and specifying a
specific .BMP file.
 
<P>
Question 8
<P>
When I use an @... SAY statement to display the contents
of a general field, nothing appears. What am I doing
wrong?
<P>
Answer 8
<P>
Use the Picture tool to display the contents of a general
field. The Field tool can't display a picture.
 
<P>
Question 9
<P>
I used the Picture tool to add a picture field to my
screen and specified the appropriate .BMP file. Please
explain in more detail how the options in the area called
If Picture and Frame Different Size affect the display of
the picture. The options are Clip Picture, Scale Picture -
Retain Shape and Scale Picture - Fill the Frame.
<P>
Answer 9
<P>
The following options only apply when the picture and
frame are of a different size.
<P>
Choose Clip Picture if you want to retain the original
dimensions of the picture. If the picture is larger than
the frame only a portion of the image is displayed
beginning with the top-left portion of the picture. Any
portion of the picture that extends beyond the frame is
hidden.
<P>
Choose Scale Picture - Retain Shape if you want to retain
the overall shape of the picture but fill as much of the
frame as possible. The picture is protected from
vertical or horizontal distortion.
<P>
Choose Scale Picture - Fill the Frame if you want to fill
the frame completely. The picture is horizontally or
vertically distorted as needed to fill the frame.
 
<P>
Question 10
<P>
I want to create a screen that allows online editing,
while a READ is active, of OLE objects stored in a general
field. When I add a picture to my screen
using the picture tool, I'm not able to edit the
displayed .BMP file. Is there a way to do this?
<P>
Answer 10
<P>
Use the Field tool in the Screen Design window to create
a general field in your screen. Select the WHEN clause and
enter the command MODIFY GENERAL &lt;field name&gt; in the code
snippet area. Save the screen and generate your screen
and/or application. Now you will be able to edit the
bitmap within the screen when the application is running.
 
<P>
Question 11
<P>
Why can't I type as many characters into an input field as
it appears will fit?
<P>
Answer 11
<P>
In a proportional font, each character is given as much
horizontal space as it needs and no more. For example, a
lowercase "f" requires much less space than an uppercase
"W." When an input field displays in a screen, FoxPro
calculates the display width of the field by multiplying
the number of characters in the table field structure by
the average size of a character in the specified font. If
the field is filled with characters that are wider than
average, the characters don't all fit within the display
width of the input field and so the characters scroll. If
the field is filled with characters that are narrower than
average, the characters don't fill the display width of
the input field.
 
<P>
Question 12
<P>
How do I control the length of a memory variable
independent of the size of an input field defined with
@ ... GET ... SIZE?
<P>
Answer 12
<P>
Use a picture clause to control the memory variable's
length, and an @ ... GET ... SIZE clause to control the
width of the input field.
 
<P>
Question 13
<P>
How can I be sure that a font I choose will be available
at the client site?
<P>
Answer 13
<P>
The safest way is to look in your WIN.INI file for
fonts that have the words "All res" on the line. These
are standard Windows fonts and consequently are those
most likely to be available at a client site.
