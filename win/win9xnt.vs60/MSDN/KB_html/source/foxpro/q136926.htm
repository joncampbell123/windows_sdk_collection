<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article provides tips to help you modify a SQL query to make it run
faster.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Some things to consider:

<UL><LI>Joins slow down SQL queries. If you don't really need a FROM table,
   remove it.

<LI>If the query involves joins, make sure there are indexes that can be
   used to perform the join. That is, for "WHERE T1.F1 = T2.F2," make sure
   there are indexes on T1.F1 and/or T2.F2. (If you have indexes on both,
   the query optimizer will choose the one it thinks is better.)

<LI>Sorts slow down SQL queries. Sorts are performed to execute ORDER BY,
   GROUP BY, SELECT DISTINCT, and UNION DISTINCT.
<P>
<P><PRE>     - Do not use SELECT DISTINCT unless you really need it. Note that if
       you have a GROUP BY, you don't also need a SELECT DISTINCT.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>     - Do not use UNION DISTINCT unless you really need it. Note that if
       you don't specify ALL or DISTINCT after UNION, the default is
       DISTINCT, so you need to explicitly say UNION ALL.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>     - Do not specify both GROUP BY and ORDER BY. If specify both and they
       are identical, the optimizer will automatically remove the ORDER BY.
</PRE>
<LI>Specify only those fields you need in the SELECT clause. When the query
   engine creates temporary intermediate result tables, it has to include
   all the fields you specified in the SELECT clause, plus any that are
   referenced in the WHERE clause if they are needed for later execution.
   For complex queries, a field in the SELECT clause could be copied from
   one table to another several times. This can especially affect
   performance if the query includes memo fields.

<LI>To take advantage of Rushmore optimization, ensure that filter
   conditions in the WHERE clause are Rushmore optimizable. You don't
   always need to make sure every condition is Rushmore optimizable, but
   make sure the Rushmore optimizable ones will greatly limit the rows from
   each source table.
<P>
</UL>For more information about the Rushmore technology and how to optimize your
applications, please see the Visual FoxPro 3.0 Developer's Guide, chapter
17, "Optimizing Applications."
