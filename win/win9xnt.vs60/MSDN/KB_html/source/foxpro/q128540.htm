The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5, 2.5a, 2.5b, 2.6, 2.6a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When a check box variable is based on a table field instead of a memory
variable, the check box initially appears as disabled if the table is
opened as SHARED.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The check box @...GET is executed before the record is locked.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Use either of the following workarounds to enable any check box:

<UL><LI>Execute =RLOCK() in the screen setup code. If the table is opened by
   the screen with the Open Files generated code option or opened in the
   screen setup code, the =RLOCK() must follow the opening of the table.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Issue either a SHOW GETS or SHOW GETS &lt;field name&gt; command for each
   check box field in the On Window Activate code.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create a table called CHKTEST.DBF with a character field named char1 and
   a logical field named log1. Add a few records.

<P><LI>Create a screen from this table and place a field from char1 and a check
   box from log1 (these should be from the fields, not memory variables).
   The check box should not be the first object.

<P><LI>Generate the screen and name it CHKTEST.SCX.

<P><LI>Close CHKTEST.DBF then run the USE CHKTEST.DBF SHARED command.

<P><LI>Issue the DO CHKTEST.SPR command.

<P><LI>The check box is disabled. You can't click it with the mouse, but
   it will behave correctly after you move to it by pressing the TAB key.
<P>
</OL><h3>General Notes</h3>
 

<UL><LI>The check box @...GET is executed prior to the locking of the record
   when the READ is issued. The record will be locked when the READ is
   issued unless READ NOLOCK has been specified as a Generated Code Option.

<LI>Issuing a =RLOCK() command prior to the check box @...GET being executed
   will lock the record and allow the check box to be properly accessed.
   This must occur after the table has been opened -- not in #SECTION1 of
   the Setup snippet.

<LI>Issuing a SHOW GETS or more specifically a SHOW GET &lt;field name&gt; for
   each check box field will suffice. Placing this code into the On Window
   Activate snippet will cause the check box to be enabled upon running the
   screen.

<LI>If the table is opened as EXCLUSIVE, or the check box is the first
   object on the screen, the check box will always appear enabled.
