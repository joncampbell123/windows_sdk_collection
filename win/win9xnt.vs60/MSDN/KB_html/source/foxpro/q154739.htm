The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, version 2.6a

<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After installing Fax Manager, the File menu pop-up of the system menu
appears blank. However, the File menu pad's hot keys function properly.
Furthermore, the other system menu pads function normally.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
There is a memory conflict between Fax Manager and FoxPro 2.6 for
Macintosh.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Disable Fax Manager by removing the Fax Manager extension located in the
Extension folder and placing it on the desktop. The Extension folder is
located within the Macintosh System folder.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The memory conflict prevents FoxPro from properly displaying the contents
of the File menu pad. The same problem may occur with other third-party fax
or communication software programs. If this behavior occurs, quit FoxPro,
disable any fax or communication software present on the computer, and
restart FoxPro.
