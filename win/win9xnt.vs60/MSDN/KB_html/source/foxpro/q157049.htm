<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article discusses general directions on how to debug remote server
applications.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Visual FoxPro 5.0 allows you to create remote OLE Automation servers.
Unlike servers deployed locally, which can either be an .exe file or a .dll
file, remote servers must have an .exe file extension. One of the
advantages with .exe type servers is that they have their own event loop,
so you can process events. However, in a typical remote situation, your
server is non-visual (typically a business object in a three-tier
situation).
<P>
Debugging your .exe servers should be straight forward. For the most part,
you should be able to test your servers locally before deploying them
remotely. Most of the servers run the same in both situations. The approach
you should take in creating and debugging a remote server is as follows:

<OL><P><LI>Create your server as an internal Visual FoxPro class.
   Assuming you have a project called Books, which has a custom class
   called taxes that calculates the state/province sales tax for your mail
   order book sales business, you might have your class loosely structured
   as follows:
<P>
<P><PRE>      * TaxLib.PRG
      DEFINE CLASS taxes AS custom
      PROCEDURE gettaxes
<PRE></PRE>         LPARAMETER cState
         DO CASE
         CASE m.cState = "CA"
           RETURN .08
         CASE m.cState = "WA"
           RETURN .07
         CASE m.cState = "NY"
           RETURN .10
         OTHERWISE
           RETURN 0
         ENDCASE
      ENDPROC
      ENDCLASS

   Your application can test this class within Visual FoxPro internally
   with code similar to the following:

      cState = "CA"
      nBookPrice = 19.95
      SET PROCEDURE TO TaxLib    &amp;&amp; can also use SET CLASS
      oTaxes = CreateObject("Taxes")
      nBookTax = oTaxes.GetTaxes(m.cState) * m.nBookPrice
      ? "Book total: "+ALLTRIM(STR(m.nBookPrice+m.nBookTax))

   The advantage here is that you are working within the Visual FoxPro
   development environment so you can take advantage of the debugger for
   common errors such as "Syntax Error."

</PRE><P><LI>Change you class definitions to OLEPUBLIC and test locally.
   Theoretically, you have already debugged for most of the common errors.
   Now, you want to test the class as an OLE Server. In order to do this,
   update the class definition to make it OLE Public and rebuild the
   project, selecting the Build EXE option. The following shows this using
   a class defined in a .prg file:
<P>
   Change:
<P><PRE>      DEFINE CLASS taxes AS custom
</PRE><P>
   To:
<P><PRE>      DEFINE CLASS taxes AS custom OLEPUBLIC
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: If you are using a visual class created in a .vcx file, you would
   go into the Class Info dialog box to select the OLE Public check box.
<P>
   Once you have created your OLE Automation Server, you can update your
   test code as follows (notice that you no longer need a SET CLASSLIB or
   SET PROC statement--the class is automatically registered in the
   Registry as an OLE class):
<P>
<P><PRE>      cState = "CA"
      nBookPrice = 19.95
      oTaxes = CreateObject("Books.Taxes")
      nBookTax = oTaxes.GetTaxes(m.cState) * m.nBookPrice
      ? "Book total: "+ALLTRIM(STR(m.nBookPrice+m.nBookTax))
</PRE><P>
   You should not encounter many problems beyond step 1; however, there are
   a few things to look out for. Since the OLE Server uses the run-time
   version, not all the language is supported (especially some of the user
   interface and designers). Make sure you avoid commands that do not work
   with the run-time version (these are documented in the Visual FoxPro
   Professional Features Guide, under "Distributing Applications").

<P><LI>Deploy the OLE Server remotely.
   You have already created your OLE server. Now, you need to register it
   remotely. The easiest way to do this is through the Remote Automation
   Connection Manager (RacMan). RacMan allows you to switch an existing OLE
   Server, which you already have registered locally, to being registered
   remotely. In order to do this, make sure your remote machine has that
   server installed and registered properly and access rights are properly
   made available to the client. Finally, to create an instance of that
   server, you must be running DCOM (Distributed COM or Network OLE)
   between your machines (NT 4.0 or later) or be running the Automation
   Manager program that ships with Visual FoxPro on the server. See Visual
   FoxPro documentation for more details on setting up for remote
   automation and using RacMan.
<P>
   Many of the problems associated with using remote automation servers are
   not with the servers themselves but rather configuring them properly
   with valid network address, protocol and access rights.
<P>
   The biggest concern at this stage is checking for wait states that might
   stop the client. For example, a MessageBox() call that brings up a
   dialog box on your server can be closed only when someone manually goes
   over to the server and closes it. Meanwhile, your application is locked
   in a busy loop waiting for the server to complete the command.
<P>
</OL><h3>Strategies</h3>
 

<UL><LI>Error handles. Error handling is probably one of the more common
   problems with remote servers. It is imperative that your error handlers
   avoid using dialog boxes that can place your server in a modal state.
   Your error handlers should return an error code (possibly message) to
   the client for proper handling.
<P>
   Depending on how conservative you are with your code, you can either
   check after each automation call to the server for an error, or let your
   error routine handle it.

<LI>Wait states. In general, your remote servers should be non-visual. There
   may be extraneous wait state code such as BROWSE, MODIFY MEMO, WAIT
   WINDOW that relies on user input. Make sure to avoid this type of code,
   which can place the client in an endless loop.

<LI>Application object properties. There are several properties you can use
   in your client applications to more effectively handle problems with OLE
   Servers, including the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      OLEServerBusyTimeout
      OLERequestPendingTimeout
      OLEServerBusyRaiseError
      StartMode
</PRE>
<LI>Blocking with OLE Callbacks. Visual FoxPro supports the ability for
   remote servers to make OLE Callbacks into your clients. An object
   reference on the client can be passed to a remote server. The remote
   server can then call a method or set a property on this object. When
   this happens in a remote situation, the Automation Manager is
   automatically launched on the client machine. A common problem with OLE
   Callbacks is when you have the client pass an object reference to a
   method on the server. This method then tries to make a callback on that
   object. A blocking problem occurs (Error: Call was rejected by callee)
   because the client is waiting for the method to complete execution even
   though the server is trying to call back into the client. Here is a
   simple example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      * Client code
      x=create("myproj.myserver")
      y=create("form")
<PRE></PRE>      x.test(y)      &amp;&amp;generates error because of blocking

      * Server code in project Myproj
      DEFINE CLASS myserver AS custom OLEPUBLIC
        PROCEDURE test
          PARAMETER oForm
          oForm.Caption = "Hello World"
        ENDPROC
      ENDDEFINE

   There are a number of ways to successfully handle OLE Callbacks. One is
   with the use of Timers (see the Pool Manager sample located in
   Samples\Servers).


</PRE></OL><h3>Common Errors with Remote Automation</h3>
 

<UL><LI>Error: OLE error code 0x800706d9: There are no more endpoints available
   from the endpoint mapper.
<P>
   Possible causes: Automation Manager/DCOM not started (running) on
   server.
<P>
   Remedy: If you are using Automation Manager, make sure to launch the
   program. With DCOM, check DCOM documentation for possible problems
   configuring it. If a successful connection is made, the Automation
   Manager window indicates so.

<LI>Error: OLE error code 0x800706a7: The RPC protocol sequence is not
   supported.
<P>
   Possible causes: The Network Protocol specified on the client machine
   for the remote server is not supported.
<P>
   Remedy: On the client machine, launch the Remote Automation Connection
   Manager and go into the Server Connection tab. Select a Network Protocol
   that is supported such as TCP/IP.

<LI>Error: OLE error code 0x80070005: Access is denied.
<P>
   Possible causes: This is often due to improper client access set on the
   server.
<P>
   Remedy: On the server machine, launch the Remote Automation Connection
   Manager and choose the Client Access tab. Make sure the System Security
   Policy is set correctly. If this does not work, try using one of the
   other Policy options such as Allow All Remote Creates.

<LI>Error: OLE error code 0x800706e4: The requested operation is not
   supported.
<P>
   Possible causes: This is often due to improper client access set on the
   server when the System Security Policy is set to Allow Remote Creates by
   ACL.
<P>
   Remedy: On the server machine, launch the Remote Automation Connection
   Manager and choose the Client Access tab. The third option should
   already be selected (Allow Remote Creates by ACL). Make sure The ACL
   (Access Control List) privileges are set correctly to allow for client
   access via the Edit ACL button. If this does not work, try using one of
   the other Policy options such as Allow All Remote Creates.

<LI>Error: OLE error code 0x80010001: Call was rejected by callee.
<P>
   Possible causes: A block in OLE Callback.
<P>
   Remedy: Make sure that callbacks are made independent of the client's
   actions. Use a timer as in the Pool Manager example.

<LI>Error: Server busy or mousepointer endlessly busy
<P>
   Possible causes: This is often due to some wait state in the server such
   as an error dialog box, message box, browse, and so forth.
<P>
   Remedy: Avoid using code that requires user input.

<LI>Error: Feature not available.
<P>
   Possible causes: Command or function is not available in run-time
   version.
<P>
   Remedy: Do not use these commands.
