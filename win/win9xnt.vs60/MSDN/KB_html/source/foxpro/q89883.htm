<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The WATCOM Linker is one of the utilities provided with the FoxPro Library
Construction Kit (LCK). The text below lists the warning and error messages
produced by the WATCOM Linker and a description of each message.
<P>
When a message contains a parameter, it includes a reference to "%s". If
the message has more than one parameter, the description refers to the
parameters as "%sn", where "n" indicates the nth occurrence of "%s" in the
message.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<PRE>MSG 2002   ** internal ** %s

   If this message occurs, contact WATCOM technical support.

MSG 2008   cannot open %s:  %s

   An error occurred when the Linker attempted to open the "%s1" file. The
   reason for the error is given in the "%s2" parameter. Generally, this
   error message appears when the Linker cannot open an object file or a
   directive file.

MSG 3009   dynamic memory exhausted

   The WATCOM Linker uses expanded memory (EMS), extended memory, and, if
   necessary, an overflow file, to hold data used to generate the
   executable file. Therefore, unless disk space is at a minimum, the
   Linker should always have enough memory to generate the executable file.

   Dynamic memory is the memory the Linker uses to build its internal data
   structures and symbol table. Dynamic memory is the amount of available
   conventional memory (below 1 megabyte); an overflow file is not used for
   dynamic memory.

   When this message appears, the Linker cannot create the application. The
   following suggestions may help to address this error:

    - Concatenate all the object files into one file and specify only the
      resulting object file as input to the Linker. Doing so reduces the
      size of the Linker file list. To concatenate object files in the
      MS-DOS environment, use the MS-DOS COPY command with the /B option,
      as follows:

         COPY /B *.OBJ ALL.OBJ

    - Each object file may contain a record that specifies the module name.
      This information is used by VIDEO to locate a module during a
      debugging session and usually contains the fully-qualified path to
      the source file. This record can consume a significant amount of
      memory when many object files are linked. If the source files are
      compiled with the WATCOM C compiler, use the "nm" option to set the
      module name different from the filename to reduce the amount of
      memory required by the Linker. If VIDEO is used to debug the
      application, it may be necessary to use the "set source" command to
      locate the source file that corresponds to an object module.

    - Typically, when a program is compiled for the large memory model,
      each module defines a different "text" segment. When compiling an
      application using the WATCOM C compiler, reduce the number of "text"
      segments that the WATCOM Linker must process by specifying the "nt"
      option. The "nt" option can specify the name of the "text" segment to
      place a group of object files into the same "text" segment.

</PRE>MSG 2010, 3010  I/O error processing %s:  %s
<P>
<PRE>   An error occurred while processing the "%s1" file. The "%s2" parameter
   lists the cause of the error. The Linker generally detects this error
   while reading from an object or library file or while writing to the
   overflow or executable file. For example, this error is issued when a
   "disk full" condition exists.

</PRE>MSG 2011  invalid object file attribute
<P>
<PRE>   The Linker encountered an object file that is not in the format required
   for an object file.

</PRE>MSG 2012  invalid library file attribute
<P>
<PRE>   The Linker encountered a library file that is not in the format required
   for a library file.

</PRE>MSG 3013  break key detected
<P>
<PRE>   The user interrupted the Linker from the keyboard.

</PRE>MSG 1014  stack segment not found
<P>
<PRE>   The Linker did not find a segment defined as having the "STACK"
   attribute.
