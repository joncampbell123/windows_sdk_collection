The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When appending from a text file using the TYPE SDF clause of the APPEND
FROM command, older dates do not append into the table properly. (This
assumes that the field in the table is defined as a date field. If the
field is defined as a character field, then the dates in the text file
append properly.)
<P>
As the date in the text file is appended to the date field, the following
occurs:

<UL><LI>The month of the date in the text file is placed into the year section
   of the date field.

<LI>The second digit in the day of the date in the text file is placed into
   the month section of the date field with a zero replacing the first
   digit.

<LI>The year of the date in the text file is placed into the day section
   of the date field.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
When creating the structure of the table, define the field that holds the
date as a character field. This character field can be changed to a date
field after the text file has been appended into the table.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create a table with two fields: a character field with a width
   of 8 and a date field.

<P><LI>Create a text file called Test.txt with the following data:
<P>
<P><PRE>      RecordA 02/14/05
      RecordB 11/25/15
      RecordC 04/02/25
      RecordD 01/20/35
      RecordE 12/16/45
</PRE>
<P><LI>Issue the command:
<P>
<P><PRE>      APPEND FROM test.txt TYPE SDF.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Browse the table and note that some of the older dates are rearranged
   as was mentioned in the SYMPTOMS section of this article.
