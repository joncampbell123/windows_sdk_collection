The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 5.0
<LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5, 2.5a, 2.5b, 2.6
</UL> 
<P>
There are several ways to speed up printing in Windows. You can apply these
tips separately or simultaneously, depending on the desired behavior:

<UL><LI>In the Printer Setup dialog box, choose Setup and reduce the dots-per-
   inch (dpi) printer resolution.

<LI>In Print Manager, change the priority setting to High priority.

<LI>In the Control Panel, run the Printers application, and clear the Use
   Print Manager check box. This will speed up printing, but will slow down
   overall system performance while the print job is printing.

<LI>On some printers, you may want to use built-in printer (device) fonts
   instead of TrueType fonts. Printer fonts have a printer icon next to the
   font name. Note that printer fonts are generally less flexible than
   TrueType fonts, and if you use printer fonts, your output may differ
   from what is shown on your screen.
<P>
   If your PostScript printer supports downloadable fonts, you might want
   to use printer fonts in place of TrueType fonts to speed up printing and
   to use less printer memory. To do this, in the Advanced Options dialog
   box of the Printer Setup command, select the Use Printer Fonts For All
   TrueType Fonts check box.
<P>
   On dot-matrix printers, TrueType fonts print only in the graphics mode
   of the printer. Because most dot-matrix printers can only print graphics
   in near letter quality (NLQ) or letter quality (LQ) mode, draft (text)
   mode is not available when printing a document with TrueType fonts;
   therefore, using TrueType fonts may slow down printing significantly.
   Using a built-in printer font in generally faster in this case.

<LI>Make sure the TEMP directory setting (SET TEMP=) in the AUTOEXEC.BAT
   file is valid. In addition, make sure that the TEMP directory is not
   cluttered with old unused temporary files. For better performance, the
   TEMP directory should be located on an uncompressed drive.
<P>
</UL>For more information about temporary files, please see the following
