</PRE><P><LI> Q. When I try to print boxes, ASCII characters are printed instead
<P><PRE>       of boxes. How can I correct this problem?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. In the Printer Setup dialog box, specify a printer setup
       appropriate for your printer. If you are already using a
       printer driver, modify the P_CODES database in order to send
       the codes appropriate to your printer, and rebuild the
       GENPD.APP file. If you are not using a printer driver, send the
       proper escape codes to the printer before you print using the
       "???" command.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. I am using the Relational Query By Example (RQBE) system to
<P><PRE>       send data to a report. The data in the report is incorrect; the
       report prints the same record over and over. How can I correct
       this problem?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. When you created the report, you used alias names in your field
       definitions. To correctly display the data in your report,
       simply modify the report by removing the alias names. For
       example, a field containing CUSTOMER.NAME should be modified to
       contain only NAME.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. Why can't I select the Printer Driver check box in the Printer
<P><PRE>       Setup dialog box?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. This problem occurs if any of the following is true:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>        - You are missing the GENPD.APP file.

        - The _GENPD memory variable is set incorrectly.

        - The resource file is turned off.

        - The FOXUSER file is missing, damaged, or marked as read-only.

</PRE><P><LI> Q. I am using a Novell(R) network. I can print by using the Novell
<P><PRE>       CAPTURE command, but the SET PRINTER TO \\SPOOLER command
       doesn't work. How can I correct this problem?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. If you receive the error message "Printer not ready," make sure
       there are no spaces after the \\SPOOLER section of this
       command. If the printer information does not print until you
       quit FoxPro, you must issue the SET PRINT TO command in order
       to release the print spooler.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. I can't make the printer drivers work in an executable file.
<P><PRE>       How can I correct this problem?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. Open the project to make sure that the GENPD.APP file is
       included in the project as an application. If it is not
       included, add the GENPD.APP file to the project as an
       application.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       NOTE: The GENPD.APP file is automatically marked as an
       excluded project element.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       Rebuild the project and your executable file. Make sure that
       you distribute the GENPD.APP, FOXUSER.DBF, FOXUSER.FPT, and
       FOXSWAP.COM files with your executable file.
