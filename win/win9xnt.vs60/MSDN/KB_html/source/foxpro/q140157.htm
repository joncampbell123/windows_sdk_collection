The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
There are several mouse enhancement utilities for the Windows environment
that allow the right mouse button to be reassigned to another function,
such as a double-click event. While enabling this feature may greatly
improve productivity, it also prevents the right mouse button from invoking
the context menus found throughout the Visual FoxPro user interface.
<P>
Although one solution is to purchase a three button mouse and assign the
double-click functionality to the middle button, you can avoid this by
using the ON KEY LABEL and MOUSE commands. The following command, placed in
Vfpstart.prg program or at the beginning of an application defines a
specific keyboard combination to mimic a right-click in order to bring up
the appropriate menu for each object.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Visual FoxPro now provides the ability to perform mouse actions
programmatically by using the MOUSE command. The desired action is
specified by CLICK, DBLCLICK, or DRAG TO clauses while the button to press
is indicated by LEFT, MIDDLE, or RIGHT clauses.
<P>
In this example, the key combination of CTRL+SPACEBAR is used as a
surrogate right-click, and the ON KEY LABEL command is initiated within
VFPSTART so that it is available throughout the development session.
<P>
<P><h3>Step-by-Step Example</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Open the Vfpstart.prg program file found in the Vfp directory.

<P><LI>Insert a new line following the #define lines, and add this line:
<P>
   ON KEY LABEL ctrl+spacebar MOUSE CLICK RIGHT

<P><LI>Save the program
<P>
</OL>Note that the command will not take effect until VFPSTART is recompiled and
run. To put the command in effect immediately, run VFPSTART or repeat the
command in the Command window.
