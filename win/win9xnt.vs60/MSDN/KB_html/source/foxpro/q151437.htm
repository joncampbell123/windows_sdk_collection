The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When using Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Power Macintosh, a default Command
button, by which the Click method is called when the user presses the
&lt;RETURN&gt; key), is denoted by a double outline surrounding the Command
button.
<P>
A problem occurs when using the Form Wizard. The Command buttons generated
are not separated far enough to take into consideration the double outline
surrounding the button with focus. This is most evident when the Visual
FoxPro system variable (KEYCOMP) is set to Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When KEYCOMP is set to Windows, the user is allowed to tab through the
Command buttons. While doing so, the focus changes from Command button to
Command button and the double, black outline surrounding the active Command
button is not entirely visible.
<P>
<P>
The Form Wizard for Visual FoxPro for Power Macintosh is designed to create
Command buttons that are used on a Macintosh. The interface standard for
the Macintosh stipulates that the user must click the mouse pointer on a
Command button and cannot tab from Command button to Command button. When
KEYCOMP is set to Mac, Visual FoxPro adheres to this standard and the user
does not see any problem with the Command buttons created by the Form
Wizard. When KEYCOMP is set to Windows, the problem appears.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
There are two ways to work around this problem. Set KEYCOMP to Mac and the
problem disappears because Visual FoxPro supports the Macintosh user
interface. This option may not be viable for developers wanting to produce
a seamless interface from Windows to the Macintosh. These developers should
set KEYCOMP to Windows.
<P>
In the cases where KEYCOMP must be set to Windows, developers need to
modify manually the form created by the Form Wizard. This involves
spreading out the Command buttons so there is enough room between them to
display the double, black outline.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.

Steps to Reproduce Problem
 

<OL><P><LI>Set KEYCOMP to Windows.

<P><LI>Start Form Wizard from the menu.

<P><LI>Select a Form Wizard.

<P><LI>Select a table to use, and put one field on the form.

<P><LI>Finish the form and run it.

<P><LI>Tab through the buttons.
<P>
</OL>Note that only part of the black outline that should surround each command
button as it receives focus is visible.
