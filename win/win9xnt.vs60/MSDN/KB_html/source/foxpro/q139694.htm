Visual FoxPro contains the original wizards as well as new ones. Each
Wizard and its associated functions are listed below.

The Cross-Tab Wizard creates a cross-tab query for displaying the results
of a query in a spreadsheet format. The wizard prompts you with simple
questions as you go through a brief series of steps in which you specify
the databases, tables, and fields that you want to use in your Cross-Tab
query.
<P>
<P><h3>Form Wizard</h3>
 
<P>
The Form Wizard creates a form for data entry from a single table. The
wizard prompts you with simple questions as you go through a brief series
of steps in which you specify the table and fields you want to use to
create controls that appear on your form. The size of the form is based on
your Maximum Design Area setting on the Forms tab of the Options dialog
box.
<P>
<P><h3>Graph Wizard</h3>
 
<P>
The Graph Wizard creates a graph from a Visual FoxPro table using Microsoft
Graph. The wizard prompts you with simple questions as you go through a
brief series of steps in which you specify the table and fields that you
want to use in your graph.
<P>

you with simple questions and creates the expressions that group your data.
<P>
<P><h3>Import Wizard</h3>
 
<P>
The Import Wizard imports data into Visual FoxPro tables from other file
formats. The wizard prompts you with simple questions as you go through a

which you specify the databases, tables, and fields that you want to use in
your view. You must have an existing database in which to store your view.

merged document or a text file that can be used by any word processor. The

tables. The wizard prompts you with simple questions as you go through a
brief series of steps in which you specify the tables and fields that you
want to use to create controls that appear on your form. The size of the
form is based on your Maximum Design Area setting on the Forms tab of the
Options dialog box.

<P><h3>One-to-Many Report Wizard</h3>
 
<P>
The One-to-Many Report Wizard creates a report that groups records from a
parent table with records from a child table. The wizard prompts you with
simple questions as you go through a brief series of steps in which you
specify the table and fields that you want to use to create controls on
your report.
<P>
<P><h3>PivotTable Wizard</h3>

The PivotTable Wizard creates pivot tables. A pivot table is an interactive
worksheet table that enables you to summarize and analyze data from
existing tables. You can choose either to save the pivot table directly in
Microsoft Excel or to add the pivot table as an embedded object on a form.
<P>
<P><h3>Query Wizard</h3>
 
<P>

questions as you go through a brief series of steps in which you specify

prompts you with simple questions as you go through a brief series of steps
in which you specify the databases, tables, and fields that you want to use
in your view. You must have an existing database in which to store your
view and an existing data source or connection.
<P>
<P><h3>Table Wizard</h3>

The Table Wizard creates tables based on typical table structures. You
select a table that fits your needs from the list of sample tables. You
can customize the table's structure and fields as you step through the
wizard. You can also modify the table at a later time after the wizard has
saved the table.
<P>

The following wizards are included with the Professional version of Visual
FoxPro only.
<P>

code files. The wizard prompts you with simple questions as you go through
a brief series of steps.
