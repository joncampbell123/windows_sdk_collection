<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>

all of the options will require approximately 6.6 MB of space.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<PRE>Filename            Description
</PRE> 
<P>
<PRE>FOXDOC              The automatic applications documentor--a
                    powerful cross-referencing and utility for source
                    code.

GENGRAPH            Interface between FoxPro's RQBE/SQL and the
                    optional FoxGraph 3D graphics package. Using RQBE,
                    GENGRAPH, and FoxGraph, direct graphical outputs
                    can be created from queries.

<PRE>                    "Commands &amp; Functions" manual.

SAMPLE directory    Large sample applications--Contains the ACCNTS,
                    CLIENTS, CONVERT, CREDIT, FAMILY, ORGANIZE,
                    RESTAURS, and TRANSACTION applications.

</PRE>TUTORIAL directory  Examples used in the "Getting Started" manual.
<P>
<PRE>GOODIES directory   Contains several subdirectories with application
                    source code and other utilities.

GOODIES\FNDATION    Example of the foundation READ--READ VALID. This
                    directory contains the EX1 and EX2 applications
                    that demonstrate the following:

                     - How to coordinate READ and BROWSE

                     - How to create applications with an event-driven
                       interface like the FoxPro interface

GOODIES\DEMO        Sources for the demo application. It contains the
                    pieces required to build the FoxPro 2.0 self-
                    running demo.

GOODIES\HELPTREE    HelpTree is an example that features the FoxPro
                    Menu Builder in action. The result is an index and
                    organizer for the FoxPro Help file.

GOODIES\SCREENS     Included are examples of two screens that can be
                    included in applications. One is a sample field
                    picker and the other is a sample file picker.

GOODIES\LASER       Concise example demonstrating how FoxPro's Power
                    Tools can be used to create full-featured
                    applications quickly and easily. Contains the
                    LASER1.APP, LASER2.APP, and LASER3.APP
                    applications.

GOODIES\ADDUSER     This is the source code for AddUser, a utility
                    that properly sets up a workstation to use
                    FoxPro/LAN effectively. Available with the LAN
                    version only.

GOODIES\FOXAPP      Source code for FOXAPP.

                    menu "snippets." Requires FoxDoc.

GOODIES\MISC        Odds and ends: files that provide FoxBASE+ 2.1
                    compatibility, a routine to convert a version 1.02
                    FoxUser preference file to FoxPro 2.0 format, and
                    the latest mouse drivers.
