<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
It seems to take an unreasonably long time to save a form file.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Other than hardware considerations such as a slow processor or minimal
memory, check for the following factors that may affect how long takes to
save a form or class file.

<UL><LI>The size and number of Include files. That is, the number and size of
   files included with #INCLUDE preprocessor directive in the .scx files
   can dramatically affect how long it takes to save a form.

<LI>The form or the class contains a lot of objects with non-default
   properties and methods. This condition is particularly true if
   there are many levels of containment (for example, pageframes that
   contain other pageframes that contain a grid that contains a custom
   class, and so on).
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 

<UL><LI>Avoid Include files when possible. If that is not feasible, instead of
   using the global Include file, specify the Include file in only those
   methods that require it. If you must use Include files, remove unused
   Defines and do not use nested Includes.

<LI>If feasible, move some of the objects into classes. That way when a
   particular .scx or .vcx file is being saved, much of the information
   will already be in the class definition thereby reducing the amount of
   data that must be written to the .scx file. When saving instances into
   classes, ensure that you move as much information into the class
   definition including methods.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft is researching this behavior and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
