</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how to use the Visual Class Designer and its child
window to size controls.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
You can use Visual Class Designer in Visual FoxPro to design custom
controls for use in applications. The Class Designer consists of a parent
window and a child window in which you can adjust the size and dimensions
of a given control.
<P>
The child window contains the control. This is not to be confused with a
container object. The child window is an editing region for the control
being manipulated.
<P>
For this reason, the control assumes the dimensions of the child window.
For example, if you drag the child window by the lower-right corner, the
control resizes to fill the frame of the child window. This is by design.
<P>
The control can be independently resized by holding down the shift key and
pressing the appropriate cursor key on the keyboard.
<P>
<P><h3>Step-by-Step Example</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create a new class using the Class Designer by choosing New from the
   File menu and clicking Class. Then click the New File command button
   to activate the Visual Class Designer tool.

<P><LI>Type in a name for this class. Under Based on, choose CommandButton.
   Type Temp in the Store In text box.
<P>
</OL>The Visual Class designer parent and child windows appear. Clicking and
dragging the lower-right corner of the child window results in the command
button resizing to the dimensions of the child window. Again, this is by
design.
<P>
The size of the window equals the size of the control. The control can be
resized inside the child window by holding the SHIFT key down and
repeatedly pressing the UP ARROW or LEFT ARROW key. When the class is saved
and placed on a form, it is displayed using the dimensions it had when it
was saved, not the dimensions of the child window it was in. If the class
is then reopened in the Visual Class Designer, the child window will have
the exact boundary dimensions of the control.
