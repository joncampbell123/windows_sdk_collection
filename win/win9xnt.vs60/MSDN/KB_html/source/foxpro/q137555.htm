<P>
Following is an overview from the document:
<P>
The purpose of this document is to provide guidelines for implementing OLE
controls and containers that will interoperate well with other controls and
containers. This document defines the minimum set of interfaces, methods,
and features that are required of OLE Controls and Containers to accomplish
seamless and useful interoperability.
<P>
These guidelines define the minimum set of functionality that is required
of a control and container; it therefore also describes the minimum set of
functionality that a control can expect of a container and vice versa. This
enables controls and container developers to assume a standard set of
functionality and to reasonably rely on the existence of that
functionality. Of course, OLE standard return-checking conventions should
always be followed.
<P>
There are many optional features that OLE controls and OLE control
containers can choose to implement, which may or may not be essential to
correct operation of the control or container. Some optional features are
grouped into function groups. A control or a control container can choose
to implement any of these function groups; function groups are not
cumulative, so a control or container can support one group without
necessarily supporting another. It is important for a control or container
to degrade gracefully if a feature or function group it uses is not
available. If an optional feature that is essential for correct operation
is not available, then the control or container should alert the user
and/or should not instantiate itself.
<P>
It is important for controls and containers that require optional features
(or features specific to a certain container) to be marketed and packaged
as such. For example, a control that requires Visual Basic's data-bound
list box should be marketed as a Visual Basic-specific control because it
cannot run in other containers.
<P>
These guidelines explicitly define those features, interfaces, methods, and
properties that are mandatory for OLE controls and control containers. Any
feature, interface, method, property, or function group that is not
explicitly stated as mandatory in these guidelines should be considered
optional.
