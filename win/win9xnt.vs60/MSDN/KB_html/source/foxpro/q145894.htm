The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0 and 3.0b
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article shows how to use the PROTECT option of a class to hide
properties and methods that are used only in the specific object class.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Within Visual FoxPro, the PROTECTED keyword in the class definition
prevents access to these properties by any methods outside of its class.
Therefore, the PROTECTED properties are invisible to outside methods. The
ability to hide properties or methods when using an object-oriented
programming approach in Visual FoxPro is a form of encapsulation.
<P>
The following example demonstrates the concept by creating a class called
Protect_Globals. The PROTECTED keyword limits the scope of the property
gd_sysdate to the Protect_Globals class. The property gc_day is not
protected and can be accessed outside the class.
<P>
<P><h3>Create a Class with Protected and Unprotected Properties</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>On the File menu, click New, select Class, and then click the New File
   button.

<P><LI>For the Class Name, enter Protect_Globals. This will be Based On Custom
   and Store In g_class.

<P><LI>Within the Class Designer, click the Class menu, and select New
   Property. For the Name, type gd_sysdate, and select the Protected check
   box. Then click the OK button.

<P><LI>On the Properties sheet, locate the gd_sysdate property, and change its
   value to:
<P>
   =DATE()

<P><LI>On the Class menu, click New Property. For the Name, type gc_day. Leave
   the Protected check box unchecked, and click the OK button.

<P><LI>On the Properties sheet, locate the gc_day property, and change its
   value to:
<P>
   =CDOW(DATE())

<P><LI>On the Class menu, click New Method. For the Name, type getsysdate.
   Leave the Protected check box unchecked, and click the OK button.

<P><LI>On the Properties sheet, locate the getsysdate method, and enter the
   following code:
<P>
   WAIT WINDOW DTOC(This.gd_sysdate) NOWAIT

<P><LI>Close the Class Designer, and save changes to the Protect_Globals class.
<P>
</OL><h3>Place the Class within a Form</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>On the File menu, click New, and select Form, and then click the New
   File button.

<P><LI>Select the View Classes tool from the Form Controls, and Add the g_class
   that was created previously.

<P><LI>Locate and select the Protect_Globals tool, and then click any place on
   the form. This will create an instance of the Protect_Globals class with
   the name Protect_Globals1.

<P><LI>Select the View Classes tool from the Form Controls, and select
   Standard.

<P><LI>Add three command buttons (Command1, Command2, and Command3) to the new
   form.

<P><LI>Change the Caption of Command1 to GC_DAY. Within its Click event, enter
   the following:
<P>
   WAIT WINDOW ThisForm.Protect_Globals1.gc_day NOWAIT

<P><LI>Change the Caption of Command2 to GETSYSDATE. Within its Click event,
   enter the following:
<P>
   ThisForm.Protect_Globals1.getsysdate

<P><LI>Change the Caption of Command3 to GD_SYSDATE. Within its Click event,
   enter the following:
<P>
   WAIT WINDOW DTOC(ThisForm.Protect_Globals1.gd_sysdate) NOWAIT

<P><LI>Save the form as g_form, and close the Form Designer.
<P>
</OL><h3>Run the Form</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Use the DO FORM command to run the g_form you just created.

<P><LI>Click the GC_DAY command button, and note that a WAIT WINDOW appears
   and displays the gd_day property of the Protect_Globals class.

<P><LI>Click the GETSYSDATE command button, and note that the gd_sysdate
   property of the Protect_Globals class is displayed by calling the
   getsysday method of that class.

<P><LI>Click the GD_SYSDATE command button. This results in a Program Error
   indicating that the gd_sysdate property cannot be found. This is because
   the gd_sysdate property is hidden to the form.

<P><LI>Select Ignore, and close the form.
<P>
</OL>In Step 3 it was possible for the value to be displayed by calling a method
of the Protect_Globals class that passed the data contained within the
gd_sysdate property. But because that property is protected, it is
completely hidden from the command button of the form that attempted to
call the gd_sysdate property directly.
