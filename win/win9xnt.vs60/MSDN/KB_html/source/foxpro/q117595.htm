<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
With the introduction of the Power Macintosh, Apple has released version
7.1.2 of the system software. System 7.1.2 has some new features and
enhancements that may confuse users unfamiliar with the new operating
system when they are performing standard troubleshooting tests. The purpose
of this article is to document the differences between System 7.1 and
System 7.1.2.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Below is a list of the new features, enhancements, and modifications found
in System 7.1.2. Note that this list may not be complete.

<UL><LI>In the Memory Control Panel, the option to enable or disable 32-bit
   addressing has been replaced with an option to turn the Modern Memory
   Manager On or Off. Since all Power Macintoshes ship with a minimum of 8
   MB of RAM, 32-bit addressing is always enabled. The Modern Memory
   Manager must be turned On in order to run "native" Power Macintosh
   applications. The option to turn off the Modern Memory Manager is
   provided in order to maintain compatibility with older Macintosh
   applications.

<LI>Owners of machines with a Motorola 68040 processor can use the Cache
   Switch Control Panel to enable or disable the on-chip caching of the
   processor in order to improve performance with System 7.1. However, the
   Cache Switch Control Panel cannot be used with the Power Macintosh.

<LI>If a Power Macintosh upgrade card is installed in a Motorola 680x0-
   based machine, there will be a Power Macintosh Card Control Panel that
   can be used to enable or disable the card.

<LI>Under System 7.1, a text editor called TeachText is provided. Under
   System 7.1.2, the SimpleText editor is provided instead.

<LI>Under System 7.1.2, there is a new Control Panel called PC Exchange,
   which makes it easy to exchange documents between Macintosh and
   MS-DOS-based or Windows-based computers. This Control Panel is superior
   in many ways to Apple File Exchange (AFE) because it can format floppy
   disks for MS-DOS and can associate MS-DOS files that have MS-DOS-style
   extensions (suffixes) with Macintosh applications and document types.
   Note also that the PC Exchange Control Panel is memory resident, unlike
   AFE, and will be disabled if the Macintosh is started without
   extensions.

<LI>Minor changes have also been made to the Monitors and Sound Control
   Panels.
