The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0
<LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5, 2.5a, 2.5b, 2.6, 2.6a
</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The RUN command functions differently in Microsoft FoxPro for Windows than
in Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS. In FoxPro for Windows, the RUN command can
be used in three different ways to execute MS-DOS commands and programs, as
detailed below.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1</h3>
 
<P>
During installation, FoxPro for Windows creates a program information file
(PIF) named FOXRUN.PIF in its default directory. The PIF file controls the
behavior of RUN commands, such as RUN DIR.
<P>
To edit FOXRUN.PIF, start the Microsoft Windows PIF Editor, choose the Open
command from the File menu, and select FOXRUN.PIF from the FoxPro
directory. Please note the following:

<UL><LI>Display Usage should be set to Windowed. If Full Screen is selected, the
   RUN command will be executed in full screen and will switch to a window
   immediately after the command has been completed. Pressing ALT+ENTER
   will not allow the display to be switched back to full screen.

<LI>If the Close On Exit check box is selected, the command will run and the
   MS-DOS window will be closed automatically upon completion. If Close On
   Exit is not selected, an inactive MS-DOS window will remain open after
   the command has been completed.
<P>
   To close the inactive MS-DOS window, click the control menu of the
   MS-DOS window and choose Close, or press ALT+SPACEBAR, and then C to
   close the window. Control will not be returned to FoxPro until the
   inactive MS-DOS window is closed. The FoxPro screen will temporarily
   appear to be disrupted.
<P>
</UL><h3>Method 2</h3>
 
<P>
To invoke the MS-DOS command prompt window in FoxPro, execute the following
command:
<P>
<PRE>  RUN DOSPRMPT.PIF

</PRE>You can now execute multiple MS-DOS commands at the MS-DOS command prompt.
To return to FoxPro, type "exit" (without the quotation marks).
<P>
Note: This active MS-DOS session will be displayed in full screen or in a
window, depending on the Display Usage setting in the DOSPRMPT.PIF file.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 3</h3>
 
<P>
Create a customized PIF file for each program, batch file, or command
to be executed, and launch it by executing the following command:
<P>
<PRE>   RUN /&lt;option&gt; &lt;PIF filename&gt;

</PRE>This approach allows programs and commands to be executed without
disruption of the FoxPro screen. Options available as parameters are listed
below:
<P>
<PRE>   Option   Result
   ----------------------------------

   n1       Active and normal size
   n2       Active and minimized
   n3       Active and maximized
   n4       Inactive and normal size
   n7       Inactive and minimized

</PRE>For example, RUN /n2 BACKIT.PIF will run BACKIT.PIF in an active and
minimized MS-DOS session.
<P>
NOTE: The .PIF must be set up to run in a window, not full screen, in order
for the example provided to work correctly (it will flash full screen
otherwise).
<P>
NOTE: In order for the batch file to finish and return control, an EXIT
command must be issued as the last statement of the .BAT file.
