The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When using the SelStart property on an Edit box that is in a PageFrame,
Page tabs appear to freeze and any object outside of the PageFrame do not
receive focus. Additionally, resizing or minimizing and then maximizing,
the form results in improper refreshing of the form.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem has been fixed in
Visual FoxPro 5.0a.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The SelStart property is used with the Edit box to return the starting
point of a text selection made by the user in a text-entry area of the edit
box, or it indicates the position of the insertion point if no text is
selected. But using the SelStart property on an Edit box in a PageFrame
causes unexpected behavior with the objects on a form and with the form
itself.
<P>
For example, moving through the pages of the PageFrame after the SelStart
property has been activated on the Edit box can only be accomplished by
clicking on a Page tab. Note the Page tab that is clicked does not become
highlighted. If the tab key is pressed or the cursor is used to move to an
object on the PageFrame, it is possible to move through the objects on the
PageFrame but any objects outside of the PageFrame do not receive focus
when trying to click on or tab to them.
<P>
The form has refresh problems, also, after the SelStart property is
activated on the Edit box. For example, resizing the form larger than the
original size causes multiple form borders to appear. Minimizing and then
maximizing the form causes the tabs of the PageFrame to disappear. Moving
through the objects on the PageFrame can still be accomplished, but to move
to another page of the PageFrame requires clicking where the tab should be
located and then the objects on that page appear.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI> Create a form and place a PageFrame on it.

<P><LI> Right-click on the PageFrame and choose the Edit menu option.

<P><LI> Place a text box on page one of the PageFrame.

<P><LI> Click on page two of the PageFrame and place an edit box and text box
<P><PRE>    on it.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Place the following code in the GotFocus event of the edit box.
<P>
<P><PRE>       THIS.SELSTART = 0
</PRE>
<P><LI> Click on the form to set focus back to the form. Place a text box on
<P><PRE>    the form.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Run the form and press the Tab key to move through the objects on the
<P><PRE>    form. Note that the cursor moves from the text box on the PageFrame and
    then to the text box on the form.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Click on page two of the PageFrame and tab to the edit box. Note that
<P><PRE>    trying to click back to page one shows the text box on page one, but
    the tab for page two stays highlighted. When trying to click on the
    text box on the form, focus stays on the objects in the PageFrame.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Try resizing or minimizing the form and then maximizing it. Note that
<P><PRE>    the form does not refresh properly.
