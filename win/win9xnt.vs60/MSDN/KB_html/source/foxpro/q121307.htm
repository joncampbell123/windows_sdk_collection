The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5x, 2.6, 2.6a
</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Modifications of the FoxPro SETUP.PJX file (Setup Wizard) are not supported
by the FoxPro Product Support Services team; however, this file can be
modified using the Microsoft Setup Toolkit, which is available as part of
the Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK). The Microsoft Setup
Toolkit does not ship with the FoxPro Distribution Kit (DK).
<P>
If you open the SETUP.PJX file and go to Procedure: MAKEINF, you will see
that the SETUP.INF file is created completely by using FoxPro code. The
properties of the Setup application are controlled by the SETUP.INF file.
To make the FoxPro SETUP.APP application (Setup Wizard) operate
differently, you will probably need to modify this section of code. To
understand what might need to be changed in MAKEINF, you need to study the
Setup Toolkit.
<P>
The Setup Toolkit is part of the Windows SDK. The learning curve for the
toolkit is a bit steep. It is not an end-user product and requires specific
knowledge of Windows setup issues. Most of these difficulties can be worked
around without much trouble. The toolkit itself is very extensible and it
is actually quite easy to put together a small-to-medium sized installation
project once you're familiar with the tools.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Setup Toolkit, included with version 3.1 of the Microsoft
Windows Software Development Kit (SDK), is documented in the "Setup Toolkit
for Windows" manual, also included with the SDK. Although this book
provides a great deal of reference information about the setup tools, it
does not provide a tutorial that explains how to use the tools.
<P>
SETTLKIT is a file in the Microsoft Software Library that contains a text
file that describes using the Setup Toolkit and a set of exercises that
build a simple set of installation disks.
