The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article tells you which files from the Visual FoxPro Distribution Kit
you may and may not distribute with your applications.
<P>
This information is also available in the Visual FoxPro Help file under
Distributable Files.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Distributable Files for Visual FoxPro</h3>
 
<P>
You may distribute any Visual FoxPro file that is not restricted. Pursuant
to the Microsoft License Agreement you received with Visual FoxPro, files
must be distributed in conjunction with a corresponding application. The
following guidelines apply to distributable files.
<P>
<P><h3>Setup Wizard</h3>
 
<P>
Any files in the Visual FoxPro DISTRIB.SRC and SETUP directories that are
required to support a corresponding application may be distributed. When
you use the Setup Wizard to create distribution disks, it automatically
places the required files from these directories on the distributable disks
in a compressed format. Upon installation, these file are decompressed and
are installed by name in the appropriate directories on the user's
computer. It is not necessary to copy these files to your distribution
tree.
<P>
<P><h3>Samples</h3>
 
<P>
Files in the Visual FoxPro SAMPLES and API\SAMPLE directories are provided
for you to learn from and build on. Although you may not distribute
unmodified Visual FoxPro sample applications, you may refer to portions of
sample application code as examples for building your own application. If
you use any files in the Visual FoxPro SAMPLES or API\SAMPLE directories
(including all .BMP, .ICO, and .CUR files), these files must be included in
your project and in the application build. They must not appear by name on
the distributable disks and may not be distributed independent of your
applications.
<P>
<P><h3>Class Libraries</h3>
 
<P>
You can use any .VCX file without modification in your applications. The
libraries must be included in your project and in your application build.
<P>
<P><h3>ODBC Files</h3>
 
<P>
Please refer to the Microsoft License Agreement you received with Visual
FoxPro for specific restrictions with respect to your redistibution of
ODBC files.
<P>
<P><h3>Restricted Files</h3>
 
<P>
Visual FoxPro contains many files that are licensed for your use only for
design, development, and testing purposes. See LICENSE.TXT, located in your
Visual FoxPro directory, for a list of restricted files.
<P>
If your application contains any of these files, remove them. Under the
terms of the Microsoft License Agreement you received with Visual FoxPro,
you are not permitted to ship these files in your application or on your
disks. The Setup Wizard checks for these files and will exclude them from
distributable disk sets. Do not assign these filenames to any files you
distribute. The Setup Wizard excludes any file that has a name identical to
one on this list.
