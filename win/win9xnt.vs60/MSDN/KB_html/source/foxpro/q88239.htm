<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
You can delete a number of diary entries by starting the
Calendar/Dairy program and deleting each entry individually. However,
there is a more efficient way to do this, as explained below.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Each diary entry is stored in the current resource file as an
individual resource record. Deleting the records from the resource
file removes the diary entries. To list only the diary entries in a
Browse window and mark the entries for deletion, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Issue the SET RESOURCE OFF command in the Command window to turn
   off the resource file.

<P><LI>Open the resource file with the USE FOXUSER or USE SYS(2005)
   command. The default resource file is FOXUSER.DBF.

<P><LI>Use the following command to open a Browse window that contains
   only the diary entries:
<P>
<P><PRE>      BROWSE FOR ID = 'DIARYDATA'
</PRE><P>
   Note that "DIARYDATA" must be in uppercase letters. In each diary
   record, the DATA field is a memo field that contains the diary
   entry. The NAME field contains the calendar date (in the format
   YYYYMMDD) to which the entry is associated. The UPDATED field
   contains the system date when the entry was created.

<P><LI>Mark the records you want to delete.

<P><LI>Pack the database to eliminate the marked records.

<P><LI>Issue the SET RESOURCE TO FOXUSER command in the Command window to
   turn the resource file on.
