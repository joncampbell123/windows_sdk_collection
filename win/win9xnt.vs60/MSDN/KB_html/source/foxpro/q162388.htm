<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
As the millenium approaches, end users and developers need to consider the
effect of the year 2000 on date recording, storage, and representation, and
date calculations in current and new applications.
<P>
This article discusses the condition of dates data in existing tables, and
the steps to consider when you adjust applications in preparation for the
year 2000. It also explains how to use the Visual FoxPro 5.0 "Set Century
To" value and "Rollover" clause, and the aspects of using a class to
control all environment variables in a project.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
FoxPro tables store the actual contents of date data-type fields with a
four-digit year value. Unless the application actually stored some other
century, existing dates are stored as 19xx where xx is the two-digit year
representation. Date calculations use this four-digit value for year.
<P>
Presentation of a year value in a screen, form, or report depends on the
Century setting. The default is for two-digits for year, or Off. To force
the presentation of the entire four-digit value for year, the application
must include the command Set Century On or the environment must have
already been set by a similar command issued elsewhere.
<P>
To illustrate this, in the command window of any version of FoxPro or
Visual FoxPro type the following commands:
<P>
<PRE>   CREATE TABLE testyear (year d)
   APPEND BLANK
   BROWSE

</PRE>An empty field appears. In this field, type in a date in the format mmddyy,
such as 040197. The date appears as 04/01/97.
<P>
In the command window type the following command:
<P>
<PRE>   SET CENTURY ON

</PRE>Click the title bar of the browse window, and notice that the presentation
of the date changes to 04/01/1997.
<P>
Type the following command:
<P>
<PRE>   SET CENTURY OFF

</PRE>Click the title bar of the browse window, and notice that the date changes
to 04/01/97.
<P>
Present FoxPro tables have the data necessary to carry existing
applications into the new millenium. However, if screens (in applications
developed for FoxPro) and forms (in applications developed for Visual
FoxPro) were created with the environment setting of Century as Off, the
@...GET and Textbox data entry controls accept only the last two digits of
the year. If the person typing in data starts to type the year as 19xx, the
19 is accepted as year 1919. The program code needs to test for such values
in the Valid procedure event or Lostfocus event.
<P>
To prepare for the correct entry of dates when the year changes to 2000 or
later, current applications probably need to be changed so that the full
four-digit year value is entered when data is recorded.
<P>
This may require the following:

<OL><P><LI>Adjusting the width of the @...GET or Textbox controls so that the full
   value can be entered and seen.

<P><LI>Modifying the presentation of dates in reports.
<P>
</OL>Also, you need to set the Century setting to On (either in the Setup
procedure of a FoxPro screen, the Init event of a Form, the Main program of
a project, or some other place where this value is initialized before you
use the Century setting).
<P>
Many developers start a project with a program that records and saves all
environment settings, resets them to the ones required for the current
application, and then resets them again to the original values at the
conclusion of the application session.
<P>
The environment settings are usually stored in the Foxuser.dbf table, but
that table can be lost through corruption or other causes. A proactive
approach to controlling the Century setting and all other pertinent
environment variables is part of good application design.
<P>
<P><h3>The "Set Century To" Value and Rollover Clause in Visual FoxPro 5.0</h3>
 
<P>
Visual FoxPro for Windows version 5.0 introduces the new "To" and
"Rollover" clauses in the Set Century command.
<P>
The Help file shows the following:
<P>
<PRE>   SET CENTURY ON
   SET CENTURY TO 19    &amp;&amp; the value can range from 1 to 99
   ? {02/16/56}         &amp;&amp; displays 02/16/1956

   SET CENTURY TO 20
   ? {01/16/56}         &amp;&amp; displays 02/16/2056

</PRE></OL>The Rollover clause specifies a year above which is the current century,
and below which is the next century. The following illustrates the use of
this clause.
<P>
<PRE>   SET CENTURY ON
   SET CENTURY TO 19 ROLLOVER 60
   ? {02/16/96}         &amp;&amp; Displays 02/16/1996
   ? {02/16/56}         &amp;&amp; Displays 02/16/2056

</PRE>Again, the Help topic says that Set Century is scoped to the current data
session. This emphasizes that the developer is responsible for proactively
controlling the Century setting through code in the initial stages of the
application. In Visual FoxPro a very convenient way of establishing the
desired settings is to use a class that you can drop into every project.
<P>
<P><h3>Using A Class to Control All Environment Variables</h3>
 
<P>
You can use the tsgen.vcx class library that is included as the Environment
class with the Tastrade application as an example (it can be used "as is").
<P>
While this class includes code in the init, set, and reset events, it does
not include how to control the Century setting. That would have to be added
to the three event methods in order to be part of the class. Follow these
steps in Visual FoxPro 5.0 to see the code for this class:

<OL><P><LI>On the Help menu, click Sample Applications.

<P><LI>Click the Open jump for the Tasmanian Traders sample to open the
   Tastrade project.

<P><LI>In the Project Manager dialog box, click the Classes tab and select the
   tsgen library. Highlight the Environment class and click Modify.

<P><LI>When the class appears in the Class Designer, right-click it and select
   Code from the context menu.
<P>
</OL>The same class may be found in Visual FoxPro 3.0 and 3.0b in the
Vfp\Samples\Mainsamp\Libs\Tsgen.vcx library. You can see the environment
class by typing the following command:
<P>
<PRE>   MODIFY CLASS environment OF SYS(2004)+"\SAMPLES\MAINSAMP\LIBS\TSGEN.VCX"

</PRE></OL>On the View menu, click Code.
<P>
