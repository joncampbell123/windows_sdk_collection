The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you create a form containing a grid whose record source is a child table
in a relation that is broken with the SET RELATION TO command, the grid
behaves as if the relation were still set and continues to show a subset of
records from the child table.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
For performance reasons, the relation information is cached and is not
reread until the grid is forced to reevaluate its record source.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Set the grid's record source to the grid itself to clear the cached
information and to force the grid to reevaluate its record source, as in
the following example:
<P>
<PRE>   Thisform.Grid1.RecordSource = Thisform.Grid1.RecordSource

</PRE>Additionally, setting the grid's record source to itself does not
cause the grid to lose nondefault properties as it did in Visual FoxPro
3.0b.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create a new form called Temp.

<P><LI>Add the following two tables to the data environment:
<P>
<P><PRE>      VFP\samples\data\customer.dbf
      VFP\samples\data\orders.dbf
</PRE>
<P><LI>Add a text box to the form.

<P><LI>Set the text box's ControlSource property to the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Customer.cust_id
</PRE>
<P><LI>Add a grid to the form.

<P><LI>Set the grid's RecordSource property to Orders.

<P><LI>Add a command button to form.

<P><LI>Place the following code in the Click method of the command button:
<P>
<PRE>      SELECT Customer    &amp;&amp; Select Parent table
      SET RELATION TO    &amp;&amp; Turn off relation

</PRE><P><LI> Run the form.

<P><LI> Click the command button.
<P>
</OL>The grid continues to show only child records related to the first record
in the parent table.
<P>
To incorporate the workaround into this example, add the following code as
the third line of the Click method of the command button on the form
created above:
<P>
<PRE>   Thisform.Grid1.RecordSource = Thisform.Grid1.RecordSource

</PRE></OL>Run the form, and click the button. The grid updates to show all child
records.
