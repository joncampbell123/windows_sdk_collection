The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When the drop down arrow of a combo box on a form is clicked, the combo box
does not appear to drop down. If the form is moved after this is done, then
the list can be seen as though it were behind the form. However, clicking
the form's title bar will cause the Combo Box list to appear in its
expected location. This behavior occurs regardless of the RowSourceType or
RowSource property settings.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The form properties AlwaysOnTop and Desktop are both set to true.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in
Visual FoxPro 3.0b for Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create a form, and set its AlwaysOnTop and Desktop properties to
   true.

<P><LI>Place a combo box on the form and set its RowSourceType property to
   7 - Files.

<P><LI>Save and run the form.

<P><LI>Click the down arrow on the combo box to see that the combo box does not
   appear to drop down. Drag the form away such that the area under the
   combo box is exposed and the list can be seen under it.
