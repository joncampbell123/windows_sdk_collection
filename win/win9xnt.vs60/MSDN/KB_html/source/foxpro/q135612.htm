The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When a form is changed from modeless to modal during run time, the form
cannot be closed (terminated).
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
If the form needs to be Modal, set the WindowType to Modal at design time.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When a form is changed to Modal at run time, it does not release when a
Release ThisForm or ThisForm.Release is issued. The only way to close the
form is to cancel the program.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 
<P>
Example One:

<OL><P><LI>Create a form with the following command buttons:
<P>
   a. Command1 with Modal as the caption and the following code for Visual
<P><PRE>      FoxPro 5.0:
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      ThisForm.Visible=.F.
      ThisForm.Show(1)
      ThisForm.Visible=.T.
</PRE><P>
   b. Command2 with Release as the caption and ThisForm.Release in the
<P><PRE>      Click event procedure.
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: Ensure that the form's WindowType property is set to 0-Modeless.

<P><LI>Run the form, and verify that the form is Modeless and that the Release
   button closes the form.

<P><LI>Run the form, and click the Modal button. Verify that the form is
   modal. Click the Release button. The form will not close.

<P><LI>Edit the form, and change the WindowType property to 1-Modal.

<P><LI>Run the form, verify that the form is modal. Then click the Release
   button. The form should close.
<P>
</OL>Example Two:
<P>
Setting the modal property programatically before the program executes
causes the form to behave a little differently. Run the following program
with the form's WindowType property set to 1. Click the Release button and
verify that although the form is no longer visible, it has not closed.
However, defining the form as modeless and then changing it to modal by
pressing the Modal command button causes the form to remain on the screen.
