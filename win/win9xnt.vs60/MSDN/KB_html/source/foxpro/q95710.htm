<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If some basic rules are followed, FoxPro can convert fields to
different types within a database without data loss.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The usual method for converting a field type in a database involves
using the MODIFY STRUCTURE command. Below is a table that summarizes
the types of field data that are possible and also indicates if data
may be lost in the translation. "Yes" indicates that the data will be
preserved, "No" indicates that data will be lost, and "Possibly"
depends on the data involved.
<P>
<PRE>Data Type  Char   Numeric   Float     Date     Logical     Memo
</PRE> 
<P>
<PRE>Char              Possibly  Possibly  Possibly Possibly    No
Numeric    Yes              Yes       No        No         No
Float      Yes    Yes                 No        No         No
Date       Yes    No        No                  No         No
Logical    Yes    No        No        No                   No
Memo       No     No        No        No        No

</PRE>Note: Depending on the string to be converted, a character field can
be converted into any other field, except a memo field.
<P>
When a character field is converted to a float or numeric, only
numeric characters are converted. In a numeric field, the characters
will be rounded unless a decimal point is part of the numeric field
definition. Moreover, when a character field is converted to a numeric
field, the sizes of the fields must match or data will be lost.
<P>
Character fields can be converted to date fields if the data in the
character field is formatted as a valid date string. The following
date formats are supported by default:
<P>
<PRE>   mm/dd/yy
   mm-dd-yy

</PRE>Character fields can also be converted to logical fields if the first
letter of the field is one of the following and is in uppercase:
<P>
<PRE>   T F Y N

</PRE>A numeric or float field can be converted to a character field as long
as the field is large enough to hold the converted data. If the field
is not large enough, data loss will occur.
<P>
Date fields can be converted only to character fields without the risk
of data loss. If you attempt to convert the date field to another
format, the data will be lost and a blank field will be created.
<P>
A logical field can be converted only to a character field without the
risk of data loss. The logical data that is stored is always converted
to a T or F character.
