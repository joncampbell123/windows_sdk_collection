<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0 and 3.0b

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When using the View property of a grid, you'll find that the Browse-Change
or Change-Browse works correctly but might not produce the look you want.
The record pointer moves through the table on the browse side. However, as
you move through the records on the browse side of the grid, the change
side does not place the field that is scrolled through at the top of the
grid as another record is selected. The field on the change side appears,
but it doesn't appear in a specific place.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design. As the next record is selected, the change side
of the grid is issued a page up or down to get to that record. Depending on
the number of fields that there are in the table, the paging stops when it
gets to a field in that record.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create a new form. Right-click the form, and choose the Data
   Environment. Then right-click again in the Data Environment box, and
   choose the Add Table menu.

<P><LI>Add any table to the Data Environment. Then drag the heading of the
   table to the form to place a grid on the form.

<P><LI>Change the grid's Partition property to 100. Select Browse - Change from
   the View property of the grid.

<P><LI>Run the form. Click the first field on the Browse side, and press the
   DOWN arrow key.
<P>
</OL>Note that the corresponding field on the change side does not show up at
the top of the grid as the record pointer is moved. The corresponding field
is displayed at different positions in the grid. This is because the fields
on the change side are internally paged through, so the field isn't
necessarily placed at the top each time another record is selected.
