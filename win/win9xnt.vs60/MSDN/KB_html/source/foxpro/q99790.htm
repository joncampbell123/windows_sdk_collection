</PRE><h3>Introduction</h3>
 
<P>
This Application Note contains a corrected version of the SetupWizard
for the Microsoft FoxPro Distribution Kit for Windows. This version of
the SetupWizard corrects the following two problems:

<UL><LI>If the SetupWizard has to split a file, it does not properly handle
   files with names that have seven letters, such as Product.exe, or
   names that have seven or fewer characters but end in a number, such
   as Fox25.exe. The corrected version of the SetupWizard properly
   handles these files.

<LI>The SetupWizard allows the disk images to be written to the
   directory where the program files are stored, if that is the
   destination directory you specified. To make distribution easier,
   the corrected version of the SetupWizard checks for the program
   files in the destination directory. If it finds them, the
   SetupWizard generates the error message "The source and destination
   directories must be different" and asks you to select another
   directory.
<P>
</UL><h3>To install the corrected version of Setup.app</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Copy the files extracted from Fk0818.exe to your FOXPROW\WIZARD
   subdirectory.

<P><LI>Start Windows and then FoxPro for Windows.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Open. In the List Files Of Type box,
   select Project. In the Directory box, select the FOXPROW\WIZARD
   directory, then in the File Name box, select the Setup.pjx file.

<P><LI>In the Setup.pjx dialog box, choose Build. In the Build Option
   dialog box, select Build Application and Rebuild All, then choose
   OK. Save changes to the Setup.pjx project when prompted.
