The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5x, 2.6, 2.6a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft directly supports FoxPro for Windows running under Microsoft
Windows 3.x. We make no guarantee, however, that FoxPro for Windows will
run under non-Windows operating systems such as OS/2. This article provides
information that may help you configure FoxPro for Windows to run under
OS/2 version 2.1.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
OS/2 version 2.1 has "session settings" that are similar to Windows PIF
files. The items below are settings that may help improve the stability of
FoxPro for Windows under OS/2 version 2.1.
<P>
<P><h3>Set WIN_RUN_MODE to Standard</h3>
 
<P>
This setting lets OS/2 handle memory management, not Windows. It provides
the 32-bit memory access that FoxPro for Windows requires and that Windows
provides only when running in 386 enhanced mode.
<P>
This setting also prevents the triggering of unsupported calls to virtual
device drivers (VxDs), which are usually responsible for the general
protection (GP) faults that are produced with FoxPro for Windows when
WIN_RUN_MODE is set to "Enhanced". The most common GP fault is:
<P>
<PRE>   FOXPROW caused a General Protection Fault in module
   TOOLHELP.DLL at 0001:2DEF

</PRE><h3>Set DPMI_MEMORY_LIMIT to 64 (Megabytes)</h3>
 
<P>
Even though only 16 MB of RAM may be installed, the memory is allocated
only as needed/requested by the program.
<P>
<PRE>   set DPMI_DOS_API to ENABLED (rather than AUTO)
   set EMS_MEMORY_LIMIT to 0
   set XMS_MEMORY_LIMIT to 0
   set DOS_FILES to 50
   set EMS_FRAME_LOCATION to NONE
   set HW_ROM_TO_RAM to ON
   set VIDEO_8514A_XGA_IOTRAP to OFF
   set IDLE_SENSITIVITY to 100
   set IDLE_SETTING to 60
   set VIDEO_MODE_RESTRICTION to NONE

</PRE><h3>Other Tips for Increasing Stability</h3>
 
<P>
Do not run FoxPro for Windows in a "seamless OS/2" window, as this causes
problems. (These problems may be machine dependent.) Running FoxPro for
Windows full-screen improves stability.
<P>
If stability has not improved, determine if FoxPro was installed directly
under OS/2. If it was, boot to MS-DOS, start Windows in 386 enhanced mode,
and reinstall. Once reinstalled, restart OS/2, configure FoxPro for Windows
with the above session settings, and try again.
<P>
If stability problems persist, contact IBM's OS/2 support.
<P>
OS/2 is manufactured by IBM, a vendor independent of Microsoft; we make no
warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's performance or
reliability.
