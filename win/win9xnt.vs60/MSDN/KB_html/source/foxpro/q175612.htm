<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The general field image of a bitmap differs in appearance depending on the
method used to place the bitmap in the field. Placing a bitmap into a
general field using the APPEND GENERAL command or the Insert Object option
of the Edit menu bar causes the visual size of the bitmap to increase and
the picture quality to decrease when compared to viewing the same file in
Microsoft Paint. However, opening the bitmap in Microsoft Paint, copying
the image to the Windows clipboard, and pasting it into the general field
produces an image that retains the characteristics of the image in
Microsoft Paint.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When a bitmap is stored into a general field, Visual FoxPro stores the
object as native data and presentation data. The combination of native and
presentation data represents the "Binary Large Object Bitmap." Opening the
general field by double-clicking displays the presentation data. The native
data appears in the default OLE server, in this case Microsoft Paint, after
double-clicking on the presentation data. Apparently, Visual FoxPro
displays the presentation data differently based on the method used to
insert the image.
<P>
In Visual FoxPro 3.0b, the presentation data may appear correctly depending
on the video display settings. For instance, an 800x600 resolution setting
displays the data correctly. However, other video display resolutions may
cause a problem similar to that described in Visual FoxPro 5.0x.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create a table that contains a general field, named gentest, and add
   three records to the table.

<P><LI>Browse the table, go to the first record, and double-click on the
   general field.

<P><LI>Start Microsoft Paint and open Setup.bmp in Windows 95 or Winnt.bmp in
   Windows NT 4.0.

<P><LI>Click the Edit menu and then click Select All and Copy. This
   copies the bitmap to the Windows Clipboard.

<P><LI>Switch back to Visual FoxPro and select Paste from the Edit menu. This
   copies the bitmap into the general field. Close the general field and
   move to the second record.

<P><LI>Type the following command into the Command window:
<P>
<P><PRE>      APPEND GENERAL gentest from c:\winnt\winnt.bmp
</PRE><P>
   -or-
<P>
<P><PRE>      APPEND GENERAL gentest FROM c:\win95\setup.bmp
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: The actual names of the operating system folder may vary.

<P><LI>Move to the last record and double click on the general field.

<P><LI>From the Edit menu, click Insert Object and Create From File.

<P><LI>Locate either Setup.bmp or Winnt.bmp and highlight it. Then choose
   Open. Finally, click OK and close the general field.

<P><LI>Open the first general field and notice that the bitmap image is the
   same size and it appeared in Microsoft Paint. Next, move to the second
   record and open the general field. The image appears both larger than
   the same image did in Microsoft Paint, and the picture quality is
   lower. The image added with the Insert Object menu option in the
   third record has the same appearance.
