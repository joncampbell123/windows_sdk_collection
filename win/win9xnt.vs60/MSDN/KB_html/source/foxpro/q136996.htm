<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The tables in the DataEnvironment can be opened and closed manually or
automatically. Both manual and automatic opening and closing have certain
advantages.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If the DataEnvironment's AutoOpenTables and AutoCloseTables properties use
their default setting of True (.T.), you don't need to write any code to
take care of opening and closing the tables and views in the
DataEnvironment.
<P>
Setting the DataEnvironment's AutoOpenTables property to False (.F.) gives
the developer a bit more control. Tables are automatically opened before
the form's Load event occurs but after the DataEnvironment's
BeforeOpenTables event. This means that if code in the form's Load event
determines an error condition (such as user opening a form that he or she
does not have permission to use) and returns False (.F.) to keep the form
from opening, a performance penalty results because the tables were opened
but never used. In this case, manually calling the DataEnvironment's
OpenTables method after checking the user's security clearance would speed
up the application. Actually opening the tables with the OpenTables method
is not significantly faster or slower than letting the DataEnvironment
automatically open them, but time can be saved by not opening the tables at
all if they are not be needed.
<P>
If many or all of the tables in a DataEnvironment are used by the next
form, formset, or report's DataEnvironment, setting the DataEnvironment's
AutoCloseTables property to False (.F.) speeds up the loading of the next
DataEnvironment, because the tables are already open.
