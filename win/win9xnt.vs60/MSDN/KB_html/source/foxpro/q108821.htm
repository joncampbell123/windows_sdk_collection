The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro Connectivity Kit for Windows, version 2.5
<LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5, 2.5a, and 2.5b
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Below is the complete FoxPro Connectivity Kit ORACLE.TXT file.
<P>
If you run SETUP.EXE from the ODBC Setup disk (Disk 2 of the Connectivity
Kit) to perform an ODBC setup, the ORACLE.TXT file is installed in the
Windows SYSTEM subdirectory.
<P>
You can also view the ORACLE.TXT directly from the ODBC Setup disk.
<P>
NOTE: There is no MS-DOS driver to connect to ORACLE. The .PLB file that is
included with the Connectivity Kit works only with Microsoft SQL Server and
SYBASE server. If you want to connect to ORACLE from MS-DOS, you will have
create your own .PLB file or get a third-party driver.
<P>

<PRE>                   SETTING UP THE ODBC ORACLE DRIVER FOR
                   USE WITH THE SQL*NET FOR WINDOWS DLLs
                   =====================================

</PRE>This file discusses how to set up the ODBC ORACLE driver to run with your
ORACLE Server software. To use the ODBC ORACLE driver with any large
application, such as Microsoft Access, you must use the SQL*Net for Windows
DLLs. Because the ODBC ORACLE driver is designed to use ORACLE Server
version 6 and the SQL*Net for Windows DLLs are designed to use ORACLE
Server version 7, you must be careful to configure your system correctly.
<P>
If you do not have the SQL*Net for Windows DLLs, or, after following the
instructions in this file, you are still unable to connect to ORACLE Server
with SQL*Net, you can contact Oracle Corp. at 1-800-345-DBMS.
<P>
(Additional information not included in this ORACLE.TXT file: The Microsoft
ODBC Driver Pack version 2.0 contains the Oracle 7 driver.)
<P>
<P><h3>If ORACLE Server version 6 is already installed on your system</h3>
 
<P>
To set up the ODBC ORACLE driver and the SQL*Net for Windows DLLs if you
already have ORACLE Server version 6 on your system:

<OL><P><LI>Make sure you have the correct versions of ORACLE products, including
    at least one SQL*Net protocol.
<P>
<PRE>       Product                                  Version
       ---------------------------------------------------

       ORACLE Installer                         3.0.8.3.7
       Required Support Files                   7.0.12.1.0
       SQL*Net Named Pipes for Windows          1.1.1.3
       SQL*Net SPX for Windows                  1.1.1.5
       SQL*Net TCP/IP for Windows               1.1.7.6

</PRE><P><LI>Test your current SQL*Net connection by using an ORACLE tool such as
    SQL*Plus for Windows.

<P><LI>Search for and delete all copies of ORA6WIN.DLL from your system. A
    new (backwards compatible) version of ORA6WIN.DLL will be installed
    with the ODBC ORACLE driver.

<P><LI>Run the ORACLE Installer program. When asked for your ORACLE
    installation directory, use the suggested default directory C:\ORAWIN.

<P><LI>Run the ORACLE Installer in the ORACLE group in the Program Manager:
<P>
    a. Install the files from the Required Support Files disk.
<P>
    b. Install the SQL*Net protocol you will be using. For more
       information, see the ORACLE documentation.

<P><LI>If the following line exists, remove it from your AUTOEXEC.BAT file:
<P>
       SET CONFIG=&lt;oracle_configuration_file&gt;
<P>
    Add the following line to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file:
<P>
       SET CONFIG_FILES=C:\WINDOWS\ORACLE.INI
<P>
    NOTE: If you are using the MS-DOS 6.0 operating system, add the
    following line to the end of your AUTOEXEC.BAT file:
<P>
       SET CONFIG=
<P>
    ORACLE Server first checks the CONFIG environment variable for the
    path of the ORACLE configuration file. If the CONFIG variable is not
    set, ORACLE Server checks the CONFIG_FILES variable. Because MS-DOS
    6.0 can use the CONFIG environment variable during system startup, you
    must clear this variable before leaving your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.
    Otherwise, ORACLE Server will use its value as the path of the ORACLE
    configuration file.

<P><LI>Make sure your PATH variable includes the BIN subdirectories of your
    &lt;oraclehome&gt; directory and the \ORAWIN directory. For example, if your
    &lt;oraclehome&gt; directory is C:\ORACLE6, add the following line to your
    AUTOEXEC.BAT file:
<P>
       SET PATH=%PATH%;C:\ORACLE6\BIN;C:\ORAWIN\BIN

<P><LI>Paste the contents of your CONFIG.ORA file at the start of your
    ORACLE.INI file. For example, if your CONFIG.ORA file contains:
<P>
       LANGUAGE=American_America.US7ASCII
       ORACLE_HOME=C:\ORACLE6
       MACHINE_TYPE=J
       SQLPATH=C:\ORACLE6
       WIN_REMOTE_SESSIONS=3
       LOCAL=p:MyServer
<P>
    and your ORACLE.INI file contains:
<P>
       [Oracle]
       ORACLE_HOME=C:\ORAWIN
       LANGUAGE=American_America.US7ASCII
       NLS_LANG=ENGLISH
       WIN_LOCAL_SESSIONS=1
       TCP_VENDOR=LANMAN
       TCP_SERVICES_FILE=C:\WINDOWS\SERVICES
<P>
    then your modified ORACLE.INI file should contain:
<P>
       LANGUAGE=American_America.US7ASCII
       ORACLE_HOME=C:\ORACLE6
       MACHINE_TYPE=J
       SQLPATH=C:\ORACLE6
       WIN_REMOTE_SESSIONS=3
       LOCAL=p:MyServer
<P>
       [Oracle]
       ORACLE_HOME=C:\ORAWIN
       LANGUAGE=American_America.US7ASCII
       NLS_LANG=ENGLISH
       WIN_LOCAL_SESSIONS=1
       TCP_VENDOR=LANMAN
       TCP_SERVICES_FILE=C:\WINDOWS\SERVICES
<P>
    Note that the ORACLE_HOME variable is set twice, once to point to the
    version 6 &lt;oraclehome&gt; directory and once to point to C:\ORAWIN.

<P><LI>If it is not already running, start Windows. Insert the ODBC Setup
    disk in drive A, choose Run from the Windows Program Manager (or File
    Manager) File menu, and then type "a:\setup.exe" in the Command Line
    box. For information about using the ODBC Setup program, see the
    online Help.

<P><LI>Run the ODBC Control Panel option and add a data source for your ORACLE
   server. For information about using the ODBC Control Panel option, see
   the online Help
<P>
</OL>You should now be able to run the ODBC ORACLE driver. You should also be
able to run ORACLE version 6 and version 7 tools and applications written
for Windows. All of these can run over SQL*Net for Windows DLLs.
<P>
NOTE: Due to differences in memory use, this configuration may not allow
you to run ORACLE MS-DOS-only tools or applications.
<P>

<P><h3>ORACLE Error Messages</h3>
 
<P>
The following section explains what to do when you encounter various error
messages from ORACLE Server through the ODBC ORACLE driver.
<P>
<P>
ORA-xxxxx Message not found; product = RDBMS; facility = ORA; language
= NULL
 
<P>
The ODBC ORACLE driver searches for error messages in the subdirectory that
normally contains the ORACLE version 6 error messages. If you receive this
error, it means that the ODBC ORACLE driver cannot find the error messages.
To fix this:

<OL><P><LI>Check that the CONFIG_FILES variable is set in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file
   and that it points to your ORACLE configuration file (ORACLE.INI). If
   you are using MS-DOS 6.0, check that the CONFIG environment variable is
   either not set or is cleared in the last line of your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

<P><LI>Check that the ORACLE_HOME variable is set correctly in your
   C:\WINDOWS\ORACLE.INI file.
<P>
   If ORACLE Server version 6 was already installed on your system,
   ORACLE_HOME should be set twice. The first time, it should be set to
   your version 6 &lt;oraclehome&gt; directory, usually C:\ORACLE6. The second
   time, in the [Oracle] section of the file, it should be set to
   C:\ORAWIN.
<P>
   If ORACLE Server was not installed on your system, ORACLE_HOME should be
   set to C:\ORAWIN.

<P><LI>If you did not have any ORACLE software on your workstation, make sure
   that you copied all the .MSB files from C:\ORAWIN\RDBMS70 to
   C:\ORAWIN\DBS.
<P>
</OL>The ODBC ORACLE driver should now be able to print the ORACLE Server error
message, enabling you to fix the problem that generated the error.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>ORA-03121  No interface driver connected -- function not performed</h3>
 
<P>
The ODBC ORACLE driver cannot find ORA6WIN.DLL or one of the SQL*Net
components. Check the following:

<OL><P><LI>Without running the ODBC ORACLE driver, make sure the network connection
   is valid. For example, type "ping &lt;servername&gt;" for a TCP/IP connection.

<P><LI>Search for and delete old versions of ORA6WIN.DLL. The correct version
   of the ORA6WIN.DLL was installed by the ODBC ORACLE driver in the SYSTEM
   subdirectory of your Windows directory.

<P><LI>Check that the PATH variable contains the BIN subdirectory of the
   &lt;oraclehome&gt; directory (usually C:\ORACLE6\BIN or C:\ORAWIN\BIN).

<P><LI>Check that the CONFIG_FILES variable is set in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file
   and that it points to your ORACLE configuration file (ORACLE.INI). If
   you are using MS-DOS 6.0, check that the CONFIG environment variable is
   either not set or is cleared in the last line of your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

<P><LI>Check that SQLTCP.DLL (for TCP/IP), SQLSPX.DLL (for Novell NetWare
   IPX/SPX), or SQLNMP.DLL (for Named Pipes) is in the ORACLE BIN directory
   specified in the PATH variable. (If not, SQL*Net was not installed
   correctly.)

<P><LI>Check that ORA7WIN.DLL and COREWIN.DLL are in the ORACLE BIN directory
   specified in the PATH variable. (If not, SQL*Net was not installed
   correctly.)
<P>
<P>
</OL><h3>ORA-06120  NETTCP: network driver not loaded</h3>
 
<P>
This error can occur when ORA6WIN.DLL is loaded but cannot find another
SQL*Net component, such as SQLTCP.DLL.

<OL><P><LI>Check that the directories containing the SQL*Net components are in your
   PATH variable.

<P><LI>Check that the ORACLE_HOME variable is set correctly in your
   C:\WINDOWS\ORACLE.INI file.
<P>
   If ORACLE Server version 6 was already installed on your system,
   ORACLE_HOME should be set twice. The first time, it should be set to
   your version 6 &lt;oraclehome&gt; directory, usually C:\ORACLE6. The second
   time, in the [Oracle] section of the file, it should be set to
   C:\ORAWIN.
<P>
   If ORACLE Server was not installed on your system, ORACLE_HOME should be
   set to C:\ORAWIN.

<P><LI>Search for and delete old versions of ORA6WIN.DLL. The correct version
   of the ORA6WIN.DLL was installed by the ODBC ORACLE driver in the SYSTEM
   subdirectory of your Windows directory.

<P><LI>Check that you have followed all the instructions for the SQL*Net driver
   you are using. For example, for the SQL*Net for TCP/IP driver, make sure
   that all the TSRs, such as NMTSR and SOCKTSR, are loaded. (If not,
   SQL*Net was not installed correctly.)
<P>
<P>
</OL><h3>ODBC Error Messages</h3>
 
<P>
The following section explains what to do when you encounter various ODBC
error messages.
<P>
<P>
<PRE>IM003   Driver specified by data source could not be loaded
</PRE></OL> 
<P>
The ODBC Driver Manager is attempting to load the ODBC ORACLE driver
(SQORA.DLL). SQORA.DLL loads ORA6WIN.DLL to connect to the ORACLE server.
You can receive this message if it cannot find ORA6WIN.DLL or finds the
wrong version of ORA6WIN.DLL.

<OL><P><LI>Search for and delete old versions of ORA6WIN.DLL. The correct version
   of the ORA6WIN.DLL was installed by the ODBC ORACLE driver in the SYSTEM
   subdirectory of your Windows directory.

<P><LI>Make sure that ORA6WIN.DLL was installed when the ODBC ORACLE driver was
   installed.
