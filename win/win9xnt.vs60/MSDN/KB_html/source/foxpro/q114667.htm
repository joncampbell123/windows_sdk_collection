The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, versions 2.5x, 2.6a
<LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you are running a graph-dependent application that has been
distributed using the FoxPro for Macintosh Distribution Kit, the following
FoxPro Graph Wizard error message appears:
<P>
<PRE>     Error Initializing OLE
     Press any key to Continue...

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Either MS Graph is not installed on the workstation, MS Graph has not been
initialized, or the Shared Code Manager, OLE Registration, Client, and
Server DLLs are not properly installed.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
A FoxPro application can take advantage of graphing capabilities by making
calls through GENGRAPH.APP to communicate with MS Graph. GENGRAPH is a
FoxPro application provided with both FoxPro for Windows and FoxPro for
Macintosh. Ms Graph is an application included with Microsoft Word 5.x for
the Macintosh, Microsoft PowerPoint 3.x for the Macintosh, and Microsoft
FoxPro for the Macintosh.
<P>
While MS Graph is available in a run-time, distributable form on the
Windows platform, this is not the case on the Macintosh platform. In order
for customers of a FoxPro for Macintosh developer to successfully run a
graph-dependent application, those customers must already own a license for
a product that includes MS Graph for the Macintosh. These applications
include Microsoft Word 5.0 for the Macintosh, Microsoft PowerPoint 3.0 for
the Macintosh, and Microsoft FoxPro for the Macintosh.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Once it has been established that the recipient of the FoxPro application
has a licensed copy of MS Graph installed on his or her Macintosh, the
recipient may need to run MS Graph once in order to register the
application as an OLE server.
<P>
To register MS Graph, double-click the MS Graph application, and then
choose Yes in the dialog box that states that MS Graph can be run only from
within another program. The Embedding Preferences file stored in the System
Folder:Preferences subfolder maintains this registration information.
<P>
In order for GENGRAPH to communicate with MS Graph, the Shared Code Manager
extension and the OLE Registration, Client, and Server documents must be
properly installed in the System Folder:Extensions subfolder. If the Setup
Wizard included with the FoxPro Distribution Kit was used and the Shared
Code option was selected during this process, these files are automatically
installed on the client workstation.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
PowerPoint and FoxPro both install MS Graph in the System
Folder:Extensions:Microsoft:MSGraph subfolder.
<P>
Microsoft Word installs the MS Graph in the Word Commands:Microsoft Graph
subfolder that is contained in the folder where Word is installed. Word
also puts an alias pointing to this location in the System
Folder:Extensions:Microsoft:MSGraph subfolder. If the Word Setup program
finds MS Graph in the System Folder:Extensions:Microsoft:MSGraph subfolder,
it does not install MS Graph again in either location.
<P>
Although Microsoft Excel 4.0 for Macintosh does include graphing
capabilities, they are built into Microsoft Excel and not stored as a
separate application. Accessing the graphing capabilities of Microsoft
Excel using FoxPro for Macintosh involves the use of AppleScript. For more
information about AppleScript, see the "Installation and Macintosh Features
Guide" included with FoxPro. For information about scripting Microsoft
Excel, see the Microsoft Excel Software Development Kit (SDK).
