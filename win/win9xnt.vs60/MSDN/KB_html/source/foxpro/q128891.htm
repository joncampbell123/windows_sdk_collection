The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes the Project Manager's Files tab and the Files tab
capabilities (sorting, including files, excluding files, and setting Code
Pages). You'll find the Files tab in the Project Manager's "Project
Information" dialog.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To get to the Project Manager's Files tab, open an existing project such as
TASTRADE.PJX, which you'll find in the \VFP\SAMPLES\MAINSAMP subdirectory.
Then either choose Project Information from the Project menu, or click the
right mouse button anywhere over the Project Manager.
<P>
The Project Information dialog is a tabbed dialog. The second Tab is the
Files option; choose it to bring it forward. The Files dialog is a summary
listing of all the files used by the project.
<P>
In the Files tab, there are five columns titled, left to right:
<P>
<PRE>   Type
   Name
   Last Modified
   Included
   Code Page

</PRE>These columns are sizable. To size a column, place the mouse pointer
(cursor) on the indented line that separates the two column headers. The
pointer should change shapes to become a left and right pointing arrow.
Click and hold the left mouse button as you drag to the left or the right.
The columns will adjust accordingly.
<P>
The columns are also sortable in either ascending or descending order.
Click a column header to sort the column in ascending order, or hold down
the CTRL key as you click the column header, to sort the column in
descending order. The Code Page Column, however, is not sortable.
<P>
You can also use the Files dialog to mark and unmark files for inclusion in
the project. To do this, click the check box in the Include column or use
the Right Mouse menu options. If a box is checked, the file will be
included or compiled into the project.
<P>
To set the Main program and Code Pages, use the Right mouse menu options.
The Main program is shown as a solid black box in the Include column.
<P>
The Code Page and Set Main options are enabled only if an appropriate file
type is currently selected. For example, if a table is the currently
selected file and a Right mouse click is executed, the Set Main option is
not enabled.
