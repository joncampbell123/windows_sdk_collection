The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The SET PRINTER TO command has been enhanced in Visual FoxPro for the
Macintosh. Its functionality differs depending on whether or not QuickDraw
GX is installed. This article describes the new enhancements that are not
described in the Visual FoxPro Help file.
<P>
Note: Since Macintosh OS 8 no longer supports QuickDraw GX printer drivers
or printing extensions, the SET PRINTER TO NAME "&lt;QuickDraw GX printer
driver name&gt;" command no longer functions in Visual FoxPro with Macintosh
OS 8. For more information on the changes to QuickDraw GX with OS 8 refer
to the About QuickDraw GX read me file in the Mac OS Read Me folder on the
OS 8 CD-ROM.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Without QuickDraw GX</h3>
 
<P>
A new feature of the SET PRINTER TO command that is available only when
QuickDraw GX is not installed is the ability to set all the page setup
options for the current printer back to their default values. The command
to do this is:
<P>
<PRE>   SET PRINTER TO DEFAULT

</PRE>To test this, try these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Make sure a printer is selected in Chooser.

<P><LI>Start Visual FoxPro.

<P><LI>Choose the Page Setup command from the File menu. Change the settings to
   something other than what they are. Choose OK.

<P><LI>In the Command window, type:
<P>
   SET PRINTER TO DEFAULT.

<P><LI>Go back into Page Setup, and observe that all the settings are back to
   what they were originally (before they were changed in step 3).
<P>
</OL>Note that when QuickDraw GX is not used, Visual FoxPro always uses the
printer that was selected in Chooser, which is the default printer of the
system.
<P>
<P><h3>With QuickDraw GX</h3>
 
<P>
NOTE: QuickDraw GX is manufactured by a vendor independent of Microsoft; we
make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding the performance or
reliability of QuickDraw GX.
<P>
The SET PRINTER TO enhancements with QuickDraw GX loaded allow more control
over the selection of the printer to be used. These enhancements work with
the current versions of QuickDraw GX (this article was tested with version
1.1.2). Future changes to the Macintosh operating system and QuickDraw GX
may cause these enhancements to stop functioning.
<P>
With QuickDraw GX, different printers are set up as icons on the Macintosh
desktop. These printers have names that can be referenced in Visual FoxPro.
These names can be used with the SET PRINTER TO NAME command to redirect a
a Visual FoxPro print job to a different printer.
<P>
For examaple, on the Macintosh desktop, there may be an ImageWriter GX
printer and a LaserWriter with name of 4SI@2253. In Visual FoxPro the
following commands can be used to switch the current printer:
<P>
<PRE>   SET PRINTER TO NAME "ImageWriter GX"
   SET PRINTER TO NAME "4SI@2253"

</PRE></OL>The first command directs Visual FoxPro's print jobs to the ImageWriter GX
printer, and the second directs print jobs to the 4SI printer by way of the
LaserWriter GX printer driver.
<P>
NOTE: The names of the printers setup on the desktop are case sensitive in
the SET PRINTER TO NAME "&lt;printer name&gt;" command. The quotation marks are
optional if the printer name does not have spaces in it.
<P>
With QuickDraw GX, there is a default printer for the Macintosh system. The
icon that shows on the desktop for the default printer has a thick black
border. In Visual FoxPro, if the Visual FoxPro printer is changed with the
SET PRINTER TO NAME &lt;printer name&gt; command, the SET PRINTER TO DEFAULT
command will set the Visual FoxPro printer back to the printer that is the
default for the Macintosh system.
<P>
You can use the SET("Printer",2) command to determine which printer Visual
FoxPro will print to. To see this in action, enter the following code in
the Visual FoxPro Command window:
<P>
<PRE>   ? SET("Printer",2)
   SET PRINTER TO NAME "ImageWriter GX"
   ? SET("Printer",2)
   SET PRINTER TO DEFAULT
</PRE>
