The information in this article applies to:

   Windows, version 5.0

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Visual FoxPro 5.0, ships with the TreeView control that is one of the
controls in the Comctl32.ocx. When you use the TreevView control in a
Visual FoxPro application, several issues may prevent you from using all
the features of the control. However, you may work around the problems by
creating an ActiveX control in Visual Basic 5.0 that acts as a
wrapper for the TreeView control.
<P>
Code that will not work if written in FoxPro may be written in Visual
Basic. When you create the control, build the functionality needed into the
wrapper control.
<P>
The sample file explains how to create the wrapper control in Visual Basic
and expose the different properties, methods, and events to a container
that is using the control. For example, the code that gives a user the
ability to drag and drop nodes in the TreeView control is built in the
wrapper control. There is also an ImageList control inside the wrapper
control so that you can assign images for the TreeView to use.

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The TreeView control example illustrates some basics of using and
manipulating the TreeView control. Because Visual FoxPro does not handle
some of the methods and properties of the TreeView control, this example
uses an ActiveX control written in Visual Basic that acts as a wrapper for
the TreeView control.
<P>
The example also shows how to add Nodes to the control using the five
different relationship settings of the Nodes Collection Add Method. The
sample code also allows you to remove a selected Node or branch.
<P>
The main focus of the example is to show how to save and restore the Nodes
in a FoxPro table. The algorithm used saves the Nodes in viewing order.
This allows you to save and restore the TreeView control with the Nodes in
the same order that the user was viewing them when the application closed.
<P>
The sample file also illustrates dragging and dropping of the Nodes. The
code allows you to drag a Node and drop it on top of a different Node so
that the dragged Node is now the child of the Node on which it was dropped
on. The drag and drop code was written into the wrapper control with Visual
Basic. The wrapper control then exposes the necessary properties, methods,
and events so that you can use the control in Visual FoxPro. An Imagelist
control is also included in the wrapper control to give you the ability to
assign an image to the nodes.
<P>
<P>
NOTE: To use this sample in FoxPro, you need to issue a SYS(2333,0) before
you open or run the TreeView form. You will also need to use Regsvr32.exe
and register the Vbtofox.ocx before you use the .ocx file. (It does not
matter where the .ocx file is located for this example to work.) The syntax
for using Regsvr32.exe is as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   Regsvr32 [/u] [/s] &lt;.ocx File Name&gt;

   where:

   /u means Unregister the .ocx File
   /s means Silent Mode (display no messages)

</PRE>If you build the .ocx file in Visual Basic, it will register the control
for you. The default in Visual Basic is to give the control a new class ID
every time the control is rebuilt. This can cause errors in Visual FoxPro
because it may be looking for a version of the control with a different
class ID.
<P>
To use this sample, you will need to have Visual Basic 5.0 and Visual
FoxPro 5.0 installed on your system. This sample has not been tested on a
machine that did not have both Visual Basic and Visual FoxPro installed.
<P>
Here are the steps to run the sample:

<OL><P><LI>Use Regsver32.exe to register the .ocx file.

<P><LI>Issue a SYS(2333,0) in FoxPro.

<P><LI>Set the default directory to the location of the Treeview.scx.

<P><LI>Run the Treeview.scx form.
<P>
</OL>The files included with this sample are listed below:
