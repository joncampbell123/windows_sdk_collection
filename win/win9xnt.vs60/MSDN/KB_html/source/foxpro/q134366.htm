The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows version 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The following error occurs on DBSETPROP() when a program created by
GENDBC.PRG is run:
<P>
<PRE>   Command contains unrecognized phrase/keyword

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
A comment for a field in a table contains a Carriage Return.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Use the following steps to modify GENDBC.PRG located in the Visual FoxPro
TOOLS\GENDBC directory so that it adds the CHR(13) as a character in the
Comment field.

<OL><P><LI>Type the following command in the Command window to open the GENDBC
   program:
<P>
   MODIFY COMMAND SYS(2004)+"TOOLS\GENDBC\GENDBC.PRG"

<P><LI>Choose Find from the Edit menu and type the following in the Look For
   box including the quotation marks:
<P>
   "comment"

<P><LI>Add a new line to the program below the following line of code, which is
   two lines below the line that was found:
<P>
   cTemp = STRTRAN( cTemp, ["], ['] )

<P><LI>Type the following command on the new line created in Step 3:
<P>
   cTemp = STRTRAN( cTemp, CHR(13), ["+CHR(13)+"] )

<P><LI>Save and close the program file.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in
Visual FoxPro 3.0b for Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
GENDBC.PRG is located in the Visual FoxPro TOOLS\GENDBC directory. This
tool generates a program that can re-create a database. It can be used to:

<UL><LI>Generate code you can analyze to learn how a database is created via
   program code.

<LI>Generate code that can be placed in your program code to eliminate the
   need to ship your databases with your application.

<LI>Generate code that can be placed in your program code to re-create the
   database if a customer's data is corrupt.
<P>
</UL>Steps to Reproduce Problem
 

<OL><P><LI>Type the following commands in the Command window:
<P>
   OPEN DATABASE SYS(2004)+"samples\data\testdata"
   USE customer
   MODIFY STRUCTURE

<P><LI>Type the following lines in the comment "Field Comment" box, pressing
   ENTER between each line.
<P>
   This is the customer's id.
   This field should be unique.

<P><LI>Click OK in the Table Designer dialog box. Click Yes when prompted to
   save the structure changes.

<P><LI>To ensure that none of the sample files are overwritten, make sure that
   your Default directory is not the Visual FoxPro SAMPLES\DATA directory.
   This can be verified by choosing Options from the Tools menu, and then
   selecting the File Location tab. "Default Directory" is the first option
   in the list.

<P><LI>Type the following command in the Command window to create a program
   that will re-create the TESTDATA database and its tables.
<P>
   DO SYS(2004)+'tools\gendbc\gendbc' WITH 'testdata.prg'

<P><LI>Now type the following command to run the program that was created in
   Step 4, and display the error message:
<P>
   DO testdata.prg
