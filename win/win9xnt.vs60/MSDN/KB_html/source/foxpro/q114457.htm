The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, version 2.6
<LI>Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS, version 2.6
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The information below lists the FoxPro wizards and provides general
instructions for using them.
<P>
This information is also found in FoxPro online Help in the "Using Wizards"
topic if you are using the Windows-style Help file (FOXHELP.HLP), or in the
"Wizards" topic if you are using the DBF-style Help file (FOXHELP.DBF).
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft FoxPro version 2.6 provides the following wizards to help you
complete common data management tasks:

<UL><LI>Client-Server Query Wizard
<LI>Report Wizard
<LI>Group/Total Report Wizard
<LI>Screen Wizard
<LI>Label Wizard
<LI>SQL Query Wizard
<LI>Mail Merge Wizard
<LI>Table Wizard
<LI>Multi-Column Report Wizard
<LI>Updatable Query Wizard
<P>
</UL>NOTE: The Client-Server Query Wizard is only available with the
Professional edition of Microsoft FoxPro version 2.6.
<P>
<P><h3>Starting a Wizard</h3>
 
<P>
There are two ways to start a wizard:

<UL><LI>In the Catalog Manager, you can choose a wizard option when creating new
   tables, queries, screens, reports, or labels. A Mail Merge Wizard is
   available when you choose the Mail Merge option on the Tools menu.

<LI>When using the FoxPro menu system and Command window, you can choose the
   Wizard... option from the Run menu, and select the type of wizard you
   want to use. Microsoft FoxPro either starts the wizard, or, if there are
   several related wizards to choose from, displays a screen from which you
   can select one.
<P>
</UL>NOTE: When you start a wizard from the Catalog Manager, Step 1 of the
wizard is skipped because you have already selected a table to work with.
<P>
<P><h3>Navigating the Wizard Screens</h3>
 
<PRE> Once you have the wizard running, just answer the questions on each
</PRE>screen, and choose the Next button when you are ready to proceed to the
next screen.
<P>
If you make a mistake or change your mind, choose the Back button to see
the previous screen so you can make changes. Choose Cancel to exit the
wizard without producing any results.
<P>
When you reach the last screen, choose the Finish button when you have
selected an option and are ready to exit the wizard.
<P>
If you are in a hurry, you can choose the Finish button to proceed to the
end of the wizard sequence, skipping the entry of optional information. The
Next and/or Finish buttons will be disabled if you need to supply
additional information before continuing.
<P>
<P><h3>Saving Wizard Results</h3>
 
<P>
The last screen of each wizard may ask you to supply a title and, depending
upon the type of wizard you are using, give you save, preview, browse,
modify, or print options. When you have selected the option you want,
choose the Finish button.
<P>
<P><h3>Modifying Wizard-Created Items</h3>
 
<P>
When using the Catalog Manager, you can use a wizard to make changes to
wizard-generated tables, queries, screens, reports, and labels. Just select
the wizard-generated item in the Catalog Manager, and choose the Modify
button.
<P>
IMPORTANT: You cannot use wizards to modify tables, queries, screens,
reports, or labels that were not created with a wizard; and, you cannot use
a wizard to modify wizard-generated items that you have modified with the
FoxPro power tools.
