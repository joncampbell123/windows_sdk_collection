The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0b
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the EDIT command to add or modify data in a table, the field
may highlight incorrectly. This causes data entry problems if the DOWNARROW
key is pressed to go to the next field instead of the ENTER key. This
affects numeric, double, integer and currency fields. All other field types
are processed correctly even though the highlight doesn't seem to cover the
entire field.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
When using the EDIT command, you need to use a :W= and the FIELDS clause to
properly highlight the numeric, double, currency, and integer fields when
the user presses the DOWNARROW key. For example:
<P>
<PRE>   EDIT FIELDS field1, field2 :W = numwhen()

   FUNCTION numwhen
   KEYBOARD '{CTRL+A}'

</PRE>NOTE: The CTRL+A or select all functionality will only work if the system
menu is active in the application or in Visual FoxPro.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem has been fixed in
Visual FoxPro 5.0 for Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In numeric fields, because they are right justified, the numbers aren't
selected, so any numbers entered are appended to the front of existing
numbers as long as the DOWNARROW key is used to move to the next field. The
only workaround found was to use the FIELDS clause, list all fields, use a
:W=, and use the following in the WHEN function to select the entire field.
<P>
<PRE>   KEYBOARD '{CTRL-A}'

</PRE>The currency field behaves differently from the other fields. If the
currency field has 0.0000 as its value, the problem will not occur. If the
currency field already has data in it, the problem will occur. The
additional data is preappended to the current data. For example, if the
current data is 20.0000 and you want to change it to 30, the new value will
be 3020.0000 unless you use :W= to highlight the entire field.
<P>
Also, if the last field in the EDIT window is a currency field and you try
to change that value for the last record in the table, the value will
change to zero - not the value you typed in. To work around this problem,
use the FIELDS list to make sure that the currency field is not the last
field in the table or permanently change the structure of the table.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Issue the following commands in the Command Window:
<P>
   USE SAMPLES\DATA\CUSTOMER
   EDIT

<P><LI>Make your EDIT window show the first record and only part of the second
   record.

<P><LI>Use the arrow keys to move down through each field.

<P><LI>Once you start scrolling, you will notice that the highlight is no
   longer highlighting the entire field.

<P><LI>Change the amount in the MaxOrdAmt field to something different, and
   then press the DOWNARROW key.
