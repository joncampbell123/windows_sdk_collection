The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0b
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run the Setup Wizard to create a set of distribution disks for
your application, you may receive the following error:
<P>
<PRE>   Setup Parse Error in Initialization Pass
   Object Id 37: CopyFile-Like Object: Bad INF Key data value

</PRE>This error repeats for Object Ids: 39, 40, 52, and 55 and the setup program
then fails.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The \Vfp\Distrib directory contains files from an older version of Visual
FoxPro.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
When you install a newer version of Visual FoxPro over an existing version
of Visual FoxPro, delete the files in the \Distrib directory. As soon as
you run the Setup Wizard again, the files that Visual FoxPro needs in the
\Distrib directory are copied into the directory.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft is researching this behavior and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This situation occurs when the following circumstances are met:

<UL><LI>A newer version of Visual FoxPro for Windows is installed over an
   existing installation of an older version of Visual FoxPro for Windows.

<LI>The Setup Wizard was used to create distribution disks while the older
   version of Visual FoxPro was installed.

<LI>The older version of Visual FoxPro was not removed or the \Distrib
   directory under Visual FoxPro was not deleted prior to installing the
   newer version of Visual FoxPro.
<P>
</UL><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Build an .exe in Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0.

<P><LI>Run the Setup Wizard, and create a set of distribution disks of the
   .exe file.

<P><LI>Install Visual FoxPro version 3.0b over version 3.0 without deleting the
   Visual FoxPro directory or removing Visual FoxPro through the Setup
   program.

<P><LI>Rebuild your .exe in Visual FoxPro version 3.0b.

<P><LI>Run the Setup Wizard again, and build a new set of distribution disks
   off the .exe file.

<P><LI>Using the distribution disks, run Setup.exe. Setup fails, and the error
   appears.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: The Wzsetup.ini file is created when the Setup Wizard is run and
retains the user's preferences for future uses of the Setup Wizard. Two
copies are created while running the Setup Wizard -- one in Visual FoxPro's
main directory and another in the intended distributed application
directory. If you intend to install a newer version of Visual FoxPro over
an older version without first removing the existing installation, consider
deleting the two copies of Wzsetup.ini as new ones are created the first
time you run the Setup Wizard again. This will ensure that you have a copy
of Wzsetup.ini that refers only to the new version of the Setup Wizard.
