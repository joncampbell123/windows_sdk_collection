<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article explains error messages that may occur in a multiuser
environment.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Attempting to Lock - Press ESC to Cancel</h3>
 
<P>
This error usually appears when a command that performs an automatic or a
manual lock is unsuccessful. It appears in place of the SET MESSAGE message
when REPROCESS is set to -2, 0, or automatic, and NOTIFY is set on.
<P>
<P><h3>Cannot write to read only file (111)</h3>
 
<P>
This error usually appears when the user attempts to change a file that has
been marked read-only. The error appears in a FoxPro error message box.
<P>
<P><h3>Exclusive open of file is required (110)</h3>
 
<P>
This error appears when an INDEX ON, INSERT, MODIFY STRUCTURE, PACK,
REINDEX, or ZAP command is issued for a database that is not open for
exclusive access. This error appears in a FoxPro error message box.
<P>
<P><h3>File access denied (1705)</h3>
 
<P>
This error appears when the user attempts to open a database for exclusive
access and the database is already opened by another user. It also appears
when the user attempts to open a database that is already opened for
exclusive access by another user. This error appears in a FoxPro error
message box.
<P>
<P><h3>File in use by another (108)</h3>
 
<P>
This error is displayed in a FoxPro error message box, and appears when one
of the following occurs:

<UL><LI>FoxPro attempts to lock a file when the file or a record is locked by
   another user.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>The user presses the ESC key in response to the "Attempting to lock"
   error message.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>You try to save an additional file to the root directory when the
   maximum number (512) of subdirectories and files already exist in the
   MS-DOS root directory
<P>
</UL><h3>Record in use by another (109)</h3>
 
<P>
This error appears when the user attempts to lock a record using an
automatic locking command when the record is locked by another user. This
error also appears when the user presses the ESC key in response to the
"Attempting to lock" or "Waiting for lock" error messages. This error
appears in a FoxPro error message box.
<P>
<P><h3>Record not available. Please wait</h3>
 
<P>
This error appears when a command that performs an automatic or manual lock
is unable to lock a record because the record is part of a transaction for
another user. This error appears in place of the SET MESSAGE message when
the NETWARE.PLB library is used to implement Novell Transaction Processing
and the "live lock" condition described above occurs.
<P>
This error can also be caused if VSHARE is not loaded. For more information
about the absence of VSHARE causing this error message, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

and one of the following commands are in effect:
<P>
<PRE>   SET REPROCESS TO -1

   -or-
