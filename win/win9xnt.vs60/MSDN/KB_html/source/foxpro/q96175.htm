</PRE><P><LI> Q. I occasionally experience problems when trying to open more
<P><PRE>       than 15 database files at one time. What could be wrong?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. Oftentimes, this problem can occur if the MS-DOS SHARE command
       is not used correctly in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file. Make sure you
       have the correct SHARE command in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file. For
       example:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>          share /f:4096  /l:500

</PRE><P><LI> Q. I'm running Windows for Workgroups. Do I need to load Share?
<P>
<P><PRE>    A. No. Windows for Workgroups automatically loads and uses a
       program called VShare, which takes the place of Share.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. Where does FoxPro store its temporary files?
<P>
<P><PRE>    A. FoxPro for Windows stores its temporary files in the same
       directory that Windows uses to store its temporary files,
       unless you specifically designate an alternative location by
       including one or more of the EDITWORK, SORTWORK, PROGWORK,
       and/or TMPFILES statements in the CONFIG.FPW file. The location
       of Windows .TMP files is specified with the MS-DOS environment
       variable TEMP. In most cases, you should let FoxPro .TMP files
       reside in the same location. However, if this location is a RAM
       drive, make sure that there is enough space available for both
       FoxPro and Windows .TMP files.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. I used to use the RUN command to change drives and directories
<P><PRE>       in an application when I used FoxPro for MS-DOS. However, this
       isn't working in FoxPro for Windows. Why is this?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. Each time you issue the RUN command to change drives and
       directories, Windows opens a new "session" of MS-DOS (otherwise
       known as a "virtual machine") and executes the command within
       the newly created session. When you exit from this session, or
       "shut down" the virtual machine, you are returned to the same
       drive and directory where you started. Because of this
       behavior, you should take advantage of FoxPro's own drive and
       directory commands to change drives and directories instead of
       using the RUN command. (For example, the SET DEFAULT TO
       C:\&lt;NEWDIR&gt;command actually issues the MS-DOS CHDIR command.)
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. Why isn't FoxPro registered in REG.DAT within Windows?
<P>
<P><PRE>    A. Only OLE servers are registered in REG.DAT. FoxPro is not an
       OLE server.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. Why doesn't the value returned by SYS(2010) match the number
<P><PRE>       specified by the FILES setting in the CONFIG.SYS file?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. Windows interacts with the MS-DOS open file tables in such a
       way that the value reported in the MS-DOS box and in Windows
       may be different.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. FoxPro for Windows automatically displays a status bar located
<P><PRE>       at the bottom of the main window. Is it possible to remove this
       status bar? Is the MS-DOS-style status bar available?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. The Windows-style status bar provides the same information as
       the MS-DOS-style status bar, plus it can also display
       information about the currently selected menu name or command
       and messages created in commands. It can even display the
       system clock.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       The Windows-style status bar is displayed by default. To remove
       the status bar, either issue the following command in the
       Command window
</PRE><P>
<PRE>          set status bar off

       or enter the following command in the CONFIG.FPW file:

          status bar = off

       To restore the status bar, simply substitute ON for OFF in the
       previous two commands.

       When the Windows-style status bar is active, messages created
       in commands such as DEFINE MENU, DEFINE POPUP, DEFINE BAR, @
       ... PROMPT, and so on always appear in the Windows-style status
       bar.

        NOTE: When the Windows-style status bar is active, the SET
        MESSAGE TO command used to specify a message location is
        ignored.

       When the Windows-style status bar is active, you can display
       the clock on the right side of the Windows-style status bar
       either by issuing the following command in the Command window

          set clock status

       or by entering the following command in the CONFIG.FPW file:

          clock = status

       For reverse-compatibility with existing FoxPro 2.0
       applications, FoxPro for Windows displays the character-style
       status bar when the SET STATUS ON command is issued.

</PRE><P><LI> Q. When I issue the SET DISPLAY TO VGA50 command and then issue
<P><PRE>       the SET DISPLAY TO VGA25 command to restore the previous
       setting, the status bar disappears. How do I restore the status
       bar?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. Issue the SET STATUS BAR ON command to bring the status bar
       back.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. When I issue the ? SET("DEFAULT") command in the Command
<P><PRE>       window, shouldn't I get a full path display rather than just
       the drive letter?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. No. This behavior is consistent with FoxPro 2.0 for MS-DOS.
