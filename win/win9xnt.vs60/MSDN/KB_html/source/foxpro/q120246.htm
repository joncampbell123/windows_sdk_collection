<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS, versions 2.0, 2.5x, 2.6
<LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5x, 2.6x
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When an .EXE file that was created with the FoxPro Distribution Kit is
executed, one of the following error messages is displayed:
<P>
<PRE>   Cannot read from drive &lt;drive name&gt;

   -or-

   Error reading drive &lt;drive name&gt;

</PRE>This problem occurs when the .EXE file is executed on a machine other than
the machine on which it was created.
<P>
NOTE: In addition to the above error, when the same problem occurs on
<PRE>      Windows NT, an "I/O operation failed" error message is returned.


</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The .EXE file was created on a computer with drive letters higher than C.
<P>
Physical and logical drive types that can cause this problem include the
following:

<UL><LI>RAM drives
<LI>Compressed drives (such as DoubleSpace, DriveSpace, Stacker)
<LI>Removable drives (such as Bernoulli)
<LI>CD-ROM drives
<LI>Hard disk drives with more than one partition
<LI>Network drives
<P>
</UL>This problem can also occur on systems with more than one physical hard
disk drive.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Create the .EXE file on a computer that does not have a drive letter higher
than C. The computer on which the .EXE file is created should not have any
physical or logical drives other than drive C.
<P>
NOTE: There are several potential causes for this problem. Some of these
causes are documented in other Knowledge Base articles. If the resolution
documented in this article does not resolve the problem, please see the
following articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../foxpro/q108165.htm">Q108165</A></B>
   TITLE     : ERR: Cannot Read from Drive &lt;Drive Letter&gt;

   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../foxpro/q114293.htm">Q114293</A></B>
   TITLE     : BUG: "Error 1002 (I/O Operation Failure)" When Starting
               CatMan

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in
Visual FoxPro 3.0 for Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This problem does not affect all systems with drives higher than C:. If you
currently have a drive higher than C: on your system, you may not encounter
this problem. This article is intended to provide assistance to customers
who do encounter this problem or who want to minimize the potential for
problems with an application that will be distributed with the Distribution
Kit.
