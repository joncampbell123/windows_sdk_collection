The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0
<LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5, 2.5a, 2.5b, 2.6
<LI>Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS, versions 2.0, 2.5, 2.5a, 2.5b, 2.6
<LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, versions 2.5b, 2.5c
</UL>

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The APPEND FROM &lt;file&gt; command with a FOR clause appears to fail and behave
incorrectly under the following conditions:

<UL><LI>When SET DELETED is OFF, the APPEND FROM &lt;file&gt; FOR NOT DELETED()
   command appends all records, including those that have been marked for
   deletion.

<LI>If the field referenced in the FOR clause is not in the current
   database, the APPEND FROM command appends no records, even if there are
   fields in the original database that meet the FOR condition.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs because the APPEND FROM command evaluates the criteria
after it has been copied from the database.

<UL><LI>In the first instance, the deleted attribute is not valid in this state
   and therefore all deleted records are copied. If SET DELETED is ON, the
   APPEND FROM command automatically ignores all deleted records.

<LI>In the second case, the APPEND FROM command tries to copy all the fields
   and then delete the fields that do not match the FOR clause. Since the
   field does not exist in the current database, the condition cannot be
   met, and the APPEND FROM command fails.
<P>
</UL><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, use the COPY TO command as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   COPY TO &lt;file&gt; FOR NOT DELETED()

   -or-

   COPY TO &lt;file&gt; FOR &lt;field&gt; = &lt;value&gt;
</PRE>
