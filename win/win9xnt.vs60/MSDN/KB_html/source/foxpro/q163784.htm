The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When using the Form Wizard to design a form for a table that contains a
particular mixture of fields of different data types and lengths, the Form
Wizard may ignore the limits of the design area, producing a form that does
not show the last few fields or the navigation buttons at the bottom of the
form.
<P>
When the design area is 640x480 pixels and the horizontal and vertical
spacing are both 12 pixels, the form will display 17 rows of fields and
labels, but any additional fields, up to enough for 22 rows, will not be
visible in the design area.
<P>
In other cases, the Form Wizard will issue a message that there are too
many fields and that there are three alternative workarounds. The "Add
Pages" alternative is already checked, but is ignored by the Wizard.
<P>
There are two alternative, incorrect results. One shows the same 17 rows
of fields and labels, but will not show the additional fields or navigation
buttons.
<P>
The resulting page of the other alternative shows 10 fields and the
navigation buttons. This usually occurs when the fields have captions.
<P>
NOTE: Not all installations of Visual FoxPro 5.0 will exhibit any form of
this behavior. Multiple tests made on Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0 exposed
the problem but other tests on similarly loaded systems did not.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
In either of the above cases, the simplest workaround is to add several
dummy fields to the table structure. The number will vary depending on the
particular table and may run as high as 22 additional fields. After the
form is designed, those fields may be deleted from the pages that hold
them. In some cases, the extra fields can even be deleted from the table
structure, and the Form Wizard will operate correctly.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create a database named "Pages.dbc."

<P><LI>To the .dbc, add a table named "Pages.dbf" that contains 18
   ten-character fields named field1, field2, field3, etc.

<P><LI>Select Options from the Tools menu. In the Options dialog box, set the
   design area on the "Form" page to 640x480 pixels, and both horizontal
   and vertical spacing to 12 pixels. Choose "Set As Default."

<P><LI>Ensure that the Pages.dbf is in the currently-selected work area.

<P><LI>From the Tools menu, select Wizards, and then select Form.

<P><LI>In the Wizard Selection dialog box, select the default, Form Wizard, and
   click OK.

<P><LI>Select all fields from the Pages table.

<P><LI>Choose "Finish."

<P><LI>In step 4, note that the "Add Pages" checkbox is checked. Select the
   "Save form and modify it in the Form Designer" option, and then choose
   "Finish."

<P><LI>The Form Wizard will build a form with only 17 fields and their names
   showing, but the property box will list label and text for field 18
   and the BUTTONS1 command button group.

<P><LI>Close the form and modify the database by issuing the following
   command:
<P>
<P><PRE>      MODIFY DATABASE Pages.dbc
</PRE><P>
   Within the database designer, modify the Pages.dbf table. On the
   first 18 fields, add captions, specifically "Long Caption n"
   (without the quotes), where "n" is the field number. Add 12 more
   ten-character fields named field23, field24, etc.

<P><LI>Save the table definition.

<P><LI>Build a new form with the Form Wizard, using all the fields of
   Pages.dbf. Save and open the form in the form designer for
   modification. Accept the default check in the "Add Pages" checkbox.
<P>
   The Form Wizard will proceed until it stops with a dialog box advising
   that you have too many fields and suggests the following options:
<P>
<P><PRE>     - Click the Add Pages Checkbox
     - Remove some of your selected fields
     - Increase the maximum design area setting in the options dialog
</PRE><P>
   When you click OK, the Form Wizard will finish.

<P><LI>Observe the form.

<P><LI>Add 8 more fields with the same characteristics and build a new form.

<P><LI>Observe the form.

<P><LI>Add 4 more fields with the same characteristics and build a new form.

<P><LI>Observe the form.

<P><LI>Modify the table by removing the last 4 rows, then build a new form.

<P><LI>The new form should show pages even though the form you built in
   step 15 did not show pages.
