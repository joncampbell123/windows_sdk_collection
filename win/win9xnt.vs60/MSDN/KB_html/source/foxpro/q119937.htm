Part 1: Introduction
 
This Readme contains details about installing and using the
FoxPro MAPI functions in FOXMAPI.FLL to integrate Microsoft
FoxPro for Windows with Microsoft Mail and Microsoft
Schedule+. For information on specific functions, see the
Help file (FOXMAPI.HLP) located in the WRKEXTS directory.
The Help file can also be accessed by selecting FoxPro MAPI
Help... from the Mail menu sample program.
<P>
Before you begin using the FoxPro MAPI routines, it is
recommended that you review the "FoxPro Environmental
Considerations" Help topic.
 
<P>
<P>
 
Part 2: Installation
 
<P>

   SPLUS.DLL
</OL> 
<P>
<P>
 
Part 3: Notes about Sample Applications
 
The FoxPro sample programs and applications are distributed
solely to provide examples and guidelines for using the
FOXMAPI library calls. Microsoft is not responsible for the
code contained in any of the sample files and does not
provide support for these files.
<P>
The sample programs contain examples of all 12 MAPI
functions contained in the FoxPro MAPI library, FOXMAPI.FLL.
<P>
<P><h3>The Library Routines in MAPILIB.PRG</h3>
 
All the sample programs access library routines contained in
the MAPILIB program file, and error routines contained in
MAPIERR.PRG. Both the MAPILIB.PRG and the MAPIERR.PRG files
are intended to be used with any of your applications that
use of the FOXMAPI library. You can modify MAPILIB.PRG and
MAPIERR.ERR to suit your own needs, and can distribute them
with your applications.
<P>
Each of the sample applications use a common log on routine
in MAPILIB which checks to see if there is an active MS Mail
session running, and then uses it for transactions.  For
information about how to run multiple sessions of MS Mail,
see the Help file.
<P>
<P><h3>The Mail Menu</h3>
 
This simple Mail menu can be added to any FoxPro application
by running the program MAILMENU.PRG, located in the
MAILMENU subdirectory. The Mail menu provides options to
send and read mail messages, and to access the FoxPro MAPI
Help file. The MAILMENU.PRG program is actually generated
code from the MAILMENU.MNX menu file.
<P>
All 12 MAPI calls are included in the two main programs used
in this sample application, READMAIL.PRG and SENDMAIL.PRG.
The majority of the calls are contained in the READMAIL
program which goes through and polls your MS Mail Inbox
messages. You should review this code closely as it contains
several tricks for successfully handing MS Mail messages in
FoxPro.
 
<P>
<P><h3>Bulk Mailing Application</h3>
 
The bulk mailing sample application shows a common use of
FoxPro and MAPI, and is located in the BULK subdirectory.
This application allows you to create  mail messages and
send them to a list of recipients contained in the FoxPro
table, MEMBERS.DBF. The content of the message includes a
simple text message and additional information matched to
each recipient, extracted from another FoxPro table,
SALES.DBF.
<P>
Note: The FoxPro tables contain place holder MS Mail names and
addressees. Running the application without modifying these
names and addresses produces an "Unknown Recipient" error. To
run the application, you should use names and addresses
contained in your MS Mail system.
<P>
Using this sample application you can send two types of mail
messages to a list of people contained in a FoxPro table:
General and Personal.
<P>
If you select the General radio button, a single message is
sent to all mail addresses contained in the table.  All names
are included in To box, and the Send Note dialog appears to
confirm the mailing.
<P>
If you select the Personalized radio button, each recipient
receives an individual copy of the message. Only one name is
included in the To box, and the Send Note dialog is
suppressed. This mailing takes more time since a message is
sent for each individual in the listing. In the code of the
personalized mailing, notice how you can set flags to
suppress the MAPI SendNote dialog.
 
<P>
<P><h3>Project File Updater Application</h3>
 
The Project File Updater application shows a simple
multiuser project manager, using MAPI. It allows developers,
each working on specific files of a common project, to update
each other's local projects with current files through a MAPI
message. In addition, a button is provided to poll for new
files which may have been sent by someone.
<P>
This sample program illustrates two MAPI uses: how to send
files to others, and how to send a MAPI message which does
not get detected by MS Mail.
<P>
The interface provides a popup menu with all the developers
working on the project. The developer names and files they
are working with are located in two tables. Being a
developer, you would select your name from the popup, and
all the files assigned to you are placed in a list box. Use
the Move button to select files to update to the other
developer's machines.
<P>
The Mail Files button creates a message with only the
updated files. No text is added to the message. For purposes
of identifying these mail messages, the subject field is
stamped with 'Project Files' and message type field is
stamped as 'IPC.ProjectUpdater'. The IPC type will not be
detected by the MS Mail client (it will not appear in the
Inbox).
<P>
The Receive Files button polls through the mail looking for
files stamped with a type "IPC.ProjectUpdater" and subject
"Project Files". A cursor table is created showing a list of
these files. Note: Files are not actually updated (i.e.,
overwritten) in the sample program.
<P>
Note: The FoxPro table contains place holder MS Mail names
and addressees. Running the application without modifying
these names and addresses produces an "Unknown Recipient"
error.  To run the application, you should use names and
addresses contained in your MS Mail system.
 
<P>
<P><h3>Schedule+ Sample Programs</h3>
 
The SPLUS directory includes sample code for calling
Schedule+ functions. FoxPro functions for both MAPI and
Schedule+ are in the single file, FOXMAPI.FLL.
 
<P>
 
Part 4: Distributing Applications to Users
 
For information about distributing applications to users,
see the topic "Distributing Your WorkGroup Applications"
in the Help file.
<P>
To help you distribute applications, compressed versions of
the MAPI.DLL and SPLUS.DLL libraries are included with the
WorkGroup Extensions in the LIBS subdirectory. These files
are named MAPI.DL_ and SPLUS.DL_.
<P>
The compressed MAPI.DL_ library is the United States version
3.02, and the SPLUS.DL_ library is version 1.0a.  If you use
updated or international versions of these files, or you
later receive updated versions, distribute your updated or
new international files to your users.
<P>
The MAPI.DL_ and SPLUS.L_ files are provided for the
convenience of you and your users. Each user must have a
valid client license for Microsoft Mail, Microsoft Schedule+,
or Microsoft Windows for WorkGroups.  You cannot distribute
these libraries to unlicensed users.
<P>
<P><h3>Distributing Library Files outside of the United States</h3>
 
You can distribute the library file MAPI.DLL from the
WorkGroup Extensions only to users who use either the U.S.
version of the Microsoft Mail client for Windows, or the U.S.
version of Microsoft Windows for WorkGroups.  You can obtain
non-U.S. versions of MAPI.DLL from non-U.S. versions of
Microsoft Mail and Windows for WorkGroups.  You can use the
SPLUS.DLL library with any language version of Microsoft
Schedule+.
 
<P>
<P>
 
Part 5: Using MAPI in Interactive Mode
 
If you type a MAPI command into the FoxPro Command Window or
use the keyboard to select a button that calls a MAPI
command, and that particular MAPI command brings up a MS
Mail dialogue box (i.e. MPSendNote), the cursor may not
appear. However, the cursor will appear if the code is run
programmatically.
