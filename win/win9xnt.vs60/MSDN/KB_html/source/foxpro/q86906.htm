The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS, version 2.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Extended Version of FoxPro version 2.0 can run on 386 and 486 computers
with a minimum of 1.5 megabytes (MB) of extended memory. Use the Standard
Version if less than 1.5 MB of extended memory is installed.
<P>
FoxPro will achieve better performance when the system has at least 2
MB extended memory installed.
<P>
Extended FoxPro is incompatible with Microsoft Windows operating
system versions 3.0 and 3.1 running in 386 enhanced mode.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Extended Version of FoxPro can use extended memory or expanded
memory; however, it cannot use both simultaneously. If some extended
memory is configured as expanded memory, FoxPro will access only the
expanded memory.
<P>
FoxPro Extended Version (X) uses a modified version of the Ergo OS386
MS-DOS Extender to run in protected mode on a 386 computer. The MS-DOS
Extender can operate in a variety of environments. When it starts, it
checks for the following memory environments in the following order:

<OL><P><LI>A DPMI (MS-DOS Protected Mode Interface) server
<P>
   Enhanced mode Windows 3.0 and 3.1 are DPMI servers. Because Ergo
   OS386 does not support DPMI, FoxPro (X) does not load if a DPMI
   server is detected.

<P><LI>A VCPI (Virtual Control Program Interface) server
<P>
   EMM386.EXE provided with MS-DOS 5, EMM386.EXE provided with Windows
   3.0 or 3.1, 386MAX and BlueMax from Qualitas, QEMM-386 from
   QuarterDeck, and CEMM from COMPAQ are all VCPI servers.

<P><LI>An XMS (Extended Memory Specification) driver
<P>
   HIMEM.SYS from Microsoft, HIMEM.SYS from COMPAQ, 386MAX and BlueMax
   from Qualitas, and QEMM-386 from QuarterDeck are XMS drivers.

<P><LI>None of the above
<P>
   In this case, the OS386 calls Interrupt 15h directly to allocate
   and use extended memory.
<P>
</OL>Because enhanced mode Windows 3.0 and 3.1 are DPMI servers, FoxPro (X)
does not run in an MS-DOS window in Windows. To work around this
limitation, use Standard Version FoxPro with Windows 3.0 and 3.1 in
enhanced mode, or use Windows 3.0 and 3.1 in standard mode and
Extended Version FoxPro.
<P>
For more information, see pages 15-6 through 15-9 of the "Microsoft
FoxPro Developer's Guide."
<P>
The servers and drivers listed above are manufactured by vendors
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise,
regarding these products' performance or reliability.
