<P>
This information is also available in FoxPro's online Help files.

To go directly to this topic, choose the "Tips and Tricks" Help topic.
Then do one of the following, depending on which online Help file is
in use:

<UL><LI>FOXHELP.HLP: Choose the "Cross Platform Tips" jump text.
<LI>FOXHELP.DBF: Scroll to the "Cross Platform Tips" heading.

</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Cross Platform Code</h3>
 
<P>
When designing cross platform applications, much of the same code can
be used transparently across platforms. Try to separate this code from
platform specific code. Code that involves database operations can
usually be generic across platforms. Interface code, on the other
hand, can vary across platforms.
<P>
Separate platform specific code using IF...ENDIF and DO CASE...ENDCASE
structures with platform system variables such as _DOS, _WINDOWS,
_MACINTOSH, and _UNIX.
<P>
<P><h3>Updating Cross Platform Applications</h3>
 
<P>
You can run FoxPro applications transparently on different platforms.
However, remember that some changes you make on one platform are not
automatically reflected on other platforms. Changes made in one
platform do not necessarily update all platforms. For example, if you
add a new object to a screen in FoxPro for Windows and recompile the
application, that new object will not appear when you run the .APP in
FoxPro for MS-DOS. You must open the screen in FoxPro for MS-DOS and
rebuild the application. The Transporter dialog appears, showing that
new objects were added on another platform and asking if you'd like to
make the same changes on this platform.
<P>
<P><h3>Transporting Screen Elements</h3>
 
<P>
When transporting applications across platforms, you may need to
adjust some screens, especially if you are going from a character to
graphical environment. If you intend to port Windows applications to
MS-DOS, leave extra space in screens because there are more pixels in
a graphical environment than there are rows and columns in a character
environment. Also, try to use objects available on both platforms.
OLE and picture objects cannot be used in FoxPro for MS-DOS.
