The information in this article applies to:
<P>
<PRE>  - Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, version 2.5b
  - Microsoft FoxBASE+ for the Macintosh, versions 2.0 and 2.01
</PRE> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
After the command SET EXCLUSIVE OFF has been issued in FoxPro for Macintosh
or FoxBASE+ for the Macintosh, databases that are subsequently opened will
continue to be opened exclusively if they exist on a local drive and
Macintosh File Sharing has not been started.
<P>
To start Macintosh File Sharing, double-click Sharing Setup in the Control
Panels window, and then click the Start button in the File Sharing section
of the dialog box.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
FoxPro and FoxBASE+/Mac rely on the file-sharing capabilities of System 7
in order to open databases nonexclusively in peer-to-peer situations.
Therefore, if Macintosh File Sharing has not been started, FoxPro and
FoxBASE+ will ignore any requests to open locally stored databases as
shared. This behavior also occurs if File Sharing is in the process of
starting up.
<P>
This situation will not arise between two or more systems on a network
because files cannot be shared unless File Sharing has already been
enabled. The only situation where this behavior is likely to occur is in a
development environment where there are multiple instances of a FoxPro or
FoxBASE+ application on a single system and the developer is using the same
files to test the application's multiuser logic.
