The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5, 2.5a, 2.5b, 2.6, 2.6a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
You see the title 'Locate Record' on the Browse window, and you are not
allowed to make any changes to the records in the window.
<P>
CAUSE
 
<P>
This is due to a code change in Foxapp.app. In versions prior to 2.6,
Foxapp allowed you to choose Browse from the Application menu. However,
this was changed in version 2.6; Browse became Locate.
<P>
After the Foxapp-generated program completes all attempts to browse a
table, the Browse window with the "Locate Record" title appears. No
modifications or deletions are possible in this window.
<P>
This happens when you choose Browse because the Browse choice uses the
BROWSE LAST command. BROWSE LAST uses the structure of the last Browse
issued, which in this case, was generated by Foxapp.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Use either of the following two solutions:

<UL><LI>Enter BROWSE in the Command window. All menu options will now work
   correctly. This solution is temporary, each time the Foxapp-generated
   application is run, it will reset the BROWSE.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Modify the Appmenu.mpr program generated by Foxapp. If you choose to do
   this, note that it permanently changes the application's read-only
   BROWSE to one that can be modified. To do this, follow these steps:
<P>
   1. Open the project Customer.pjx.
<P>
   2. Edit the Appmenu menu. Then edit the application submenu. Scroll the
<P><PRE>      list to find the 'Locate' prompt. Edit the procedure associated with
      this prompt. You will see a command statement that reads:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>         BROWSE WINDOW FA_loc NOEDIT NODELETE NOAPPEND ;
         NOMENU TITLE "Locate Record" COLOR SCHEME 10

      Change it to read:

         BROWSE WINDOW FA_loc  ;
         NOMENU TITLE "Locate Record" COLOR SCHEME 10

      By removing NOEDIT NODELETE NOAPPEND, you make the Browse modifiable.
      See the Language Reference (pp. L3-232 - L3-251) for a description of
      the other clauses.

      Press CTRL+W twice to save the changes to the procedure and Appmenu.

   3. Build the Application,and test the results of your changes by
      starting from step 2 in the "Steps to Reproduce Behavior" section
      of this article.

</PRE></UL>NOTE: You can choose to change the name of the menu bar option from Locate
to Browse.

   the ESC key to close the Browse. Close the screen by clicking the Quit
   button.
