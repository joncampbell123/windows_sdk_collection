<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The AppleScript language supports a RETURN statement that allows the author
of a script to send a result back to the calling procedure. The calling
procedure can be a FoxPro program, command, or procedure. Examples are
provided below.
<P>
NOTE: AppleScript is manufactured by a vendor independent of Microsoft; we
make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
performance or reliability.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
A script, which is a series of one or more commands supported by the
AppleScript language, is analogous to a procedure written in Microsoft
FoxPro or some other high-level language. Like procedures, a script can
communicate with a calling program by returning a value to it. To run a
script from within Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, use the following
command syntax:
<P>
<PRE>  RUNSCRIPT &lt;AppleScript&gt; [TO &lt;variable&gt; | &lt;field&gt;]

</PRE>If the script terminates with a RETURN statement, that value is returned to
FoxPro and stored in the optional parameter to the RUNSCRIPT command.
<P>
The following example is an elementary AppleScript script that simply
returns a Boolean, or logical, value:
<P>
<PRE>   return TRUE

</PRE>The following example illustrates how FoxPro for Macintosh can store a
value to a variable named retVal from an AppleScript script named MyScript:
<P>
<PRE>   RUNSCRIPT HD:Scripts:MyScript TO retVal

</PRE>Although AppleScript supports a variety of extended types, or classes, such
as lists, records, and aliases, FoxPro transforms them into simple
character expressions when storing them.
<P>
Since only a single value can be returned from an AppleScript script and
FoxPro for Macintosh does not support the passing of parameters to an
AppleScript script, a character expression delimited with commas or some
other value is recommended. Since AppleScript supports the list as a
standard class, it makes sense to take advantage of it to build a list of
return values. For example, the following AppleScript returns multiple
values to the calling program by building a list object:
<P>
<PRE>   set theList to {"First"}
   set theList to theList &amp; "Second"
   return theList

</PRE>If you save the script, name it MyScript2, and invoke it issuing the
following command in the FoxPro Command window:
<P>
<PRE>   RUNSCRIPT MyScript2 TO retVal

</PRE>The list is returned to FoxPro as a character string delimited with commas.
In this case, the character expression "First, Last" is returned, and the
individual values can be returned using FoxPro's arsenal of string-
manipulation functions such as SUBSTR() and AT(). The following FoxPro code
snippet extracts the elements from retVal and stores the individual values
to new variables:
<P>
<PRE>   var1 = SUBSTR(retVal,1,AT(',',retVal)-1)
   var2 = SUBSTR(retVAL,AT(',',retVal)+3)

</PRE>For more information about AppleScript, including a detailed explanation of
the language and its supported types, see the "AppleScript Developer's Kit"
from Apple Computer.
