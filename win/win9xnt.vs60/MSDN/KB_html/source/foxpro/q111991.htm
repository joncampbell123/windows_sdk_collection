<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS, versions 2.0, 2.5x, 2.6x
<LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0

</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Although the FoxPro command-line length limit is 2048 bytes, a line of
compiled code cannot exceed 1024 bytes (1 kilobyte). This means you can
write a line of code containing fewer than 2048 characters that will
generate the error message "Compiled code for this line too long" (1252).
<P>
In Visual FoxPro, the maximum number of characters per line is 8K
(kilobytes). The maximum size of a line of compiled code is 4K.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The relationship between the character representation of a command and its
compiled or "tokenized" length is unpredictable.
<P>
Variable names and object references of different lengths may compile to
the same number of bytes. For example, a reference to the memory variable
"A" compiles to 3 bytes. However, a reference to the variable "ABCDEFGH"
also compiles to 3 bytes. Similarly, a reference to the number "1" and a
reference to the number "200" will each compile to 3 bytes. For this
reason, shortening alias names has no effect on the length of the tokenized
line.
<P>
In addition, white space and literal strings (character strings placed
within quotation marks) are not tokenized. Therefore, eliminating spaces
and indentation in the command line also will not affect the tokenized line
length.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this behavior, do one of the following:

<UL><LI>Use an ON ERROR routine that traps errors 18 (Line too long), 1252
   (Compiled code for this line too long), and 1812 (SQL statement too
   long).
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Replace literal strings with variable references. This would also work
   for date literals (for example, {12/30/93}) and many numeric literals
   (for example, 4.5).
<P>
   For example, in the following SQL SELECT command
<P>
<P><PRE>      SELECT * FROM customer ;
<PRE></PRE>           WHERE company = "Allied Products" or company = "Microsoft Corp."

   the quoted text strings, "Allied Products" and "Microsoft Corp.", cannot
   be tokenized any further.

   To work around this, create a set of variables such as

      m.company1="Allied Products"
      m.company2="Microsoft Corp."

   and change your SELECT command line to the following:

      SELECT * FROM customer;
           WHERE company=m.company1 or company=m.company2

   In many cases, this command will tokenize smaller than the original
   command.

   NOTE: This solution does not work for small integers (less than 256)
   because the size of a tokenized 1-byte integer is the same as the size
   of a tokenized variable reference.
