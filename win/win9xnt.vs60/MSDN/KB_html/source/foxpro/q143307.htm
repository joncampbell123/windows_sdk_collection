The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0 and 3.0b
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article shows by example how to maintain the changed ForeColor of a
grid cell upon selecting a cell that has had its default forecolor changed
(based on criteria of the data) to something other than the default.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following example shows how to have a selected cell in a grid retain
its changed ForeColor upon selecting the cell, instead of the cell changing
its color back to the default color.
<P>
<P><h3>Step-by-Step Example</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create a new form and add the Customer table (located in Samples\Data)
   to the Data Environment. Place a grid on the form by dragging the
   Customer table from the Data Environment.

<P><LI>Change the Grid1 ColumnCount property to 2.

<P><LI>Ensure that the Grid1 RecordSource property is Customer.

<P><LI>Ensure that the RecordSourceType property is 1 - Alias.

<P><LI>Change the Grid1 Column1 ControlSource property to customer.cust_id.

<P><LI>Change the Grid1 Column2 ControlSource property to customer.country.

<P><LI>Place the following code in Grid1 Column1 DynamicForeColor method:
<P>
<P><PRE>      "IIF(customer.country='Germany',255,0)"  &amp;&amp; use the quotation marks
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: The previous line changes the ForeColor to Red if the country is
   Germany, otherwise it is Black. (There should be an equal (=) sign
   in front of this statement in the property sheet dialog line.

<P><LI>Place the following code in the Grid1 Column1 Text1 GotFocus event:
<P>
   This.SelectedForeColor=IIF(customer.country='Germany',255,0)
<P>
   NOTE: The previous line retains the ForeColor of the cell upon
   selection.

<P><LI>Save and run the Form.
<P>
</OL>Using the up and down arrow keys, scroll through the grid and observe that
the records having Germany in the Country column maintain red as the cells
are selected - instead of changing to black. Remove the line of code in
Grid1.Column1.Text1.GotFocus event, run the form, and observe that the
selected Germany cell changes to black upon selection.
