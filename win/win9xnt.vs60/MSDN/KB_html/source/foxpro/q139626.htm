<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article shows by example how to drag objects between containers. This
example uses a custom container class and drags a bitmap image between the
containers. This example also shows how to drag an image within the
control. However, this example does not cover all the possible variations
of dragging and dropping objects; it is intended to demonstrate only the
basic principles and code necessary to implement drag and drop. You should
be prepared to modify the sample code given here to meet the needs of your
situation.
<P>

<P>
<P><h3>Step-by-Step Example</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create a new class (on the File menu, click New, and then click Class).

<P><LI>In the New Class dialog box, name the class Containerx, select Container
   from the Based On combo box, and select a class library in which to
   store the class.

<P><LI>In the Class Designer, resize the container to make it perhaps one inch
   wide by two inches high. Accept the remaining defaults. Exit the Class
   Designer, and save your changes.

<P><LI>Create a new form, making it big enough to hold two containers.

<P><LI>Click the View Classes button on the Forms Control toolbar. Click Add,
   and select the library in which you stored the container class. Locate
   the button for the container class you created (Containerx), click it,
   and add it to the form. Repeat this step so that you have two
   containers (Containerx1 and Containerx2).

<P><LI>Add an image (Image1) to Containerx1. To do this:
<P>
   a. Select the Containerx1 container.
<P>
   b. Right-click the container, and then click Edit.
<P>
   c. Add the image (Image1) to the Containerx1 container.
<P>
   NOTE: Adding the image in this manner ensures that the image is added to
   the container, rather than simply floating on top of it.

<P><LI>Select the Image1 control. Set its DragDrop property to 1 (automatic),
   and set its Picture property to a bitmap image. The Fox.bmp in the Vfp
   directory is a good choice.
<P>
   NOTE: Because the DragMode property is set to automatic for the image,
   you do not need to code any events for the image. If the DragMode
   property were 0 (manual), you would have to code the MouseDown and
   MouseUp events to call the Drag method.

<P><LI>To allow the image to be dragged or moved between containers, you need
   to provide a way to check and see if an image already exists in the
   container. Two custom properties can be added to help. On the Form menu,
   click New Property. Name the first property Container1pict and the
   second Container2pict. Click the Other tab of the Property sheet. Locate
   the Container1pict property, and set it to True (.T.). Keep the default
   value of False (.F.) for the second property (Container2pict).

<P><LI>Add code to the DragDrop event of both containers. This code executes
   when the object is released (dropped).
<P>
<P><PRE>      a. Enter the following code in the DragDrop event of Containerx2:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>         * The first line is already there.
         * oSource is a reference to the object being dragged.
         * nXcoord and nYcoord are the coordinates of the mouse pointer
         * within the target form. Their coordinates are taken from the
         * position of the tip of the mouse pointer.

      LPARAMETERS oSource, nXCoord, nYCoord

      oName = oSource.name
      * The IF test checks the Container1pict property. It it is true (.T),
      * the object already exists and you are moving it, so you can skip
      * the addobject procedures. If it is false (.F.), you need to run the
      * addobject procedures

      IF thisform.container1pict = .T.

      * Addobject adds an object of the type specified by oSource.class to
      * the container and gives it the name referenced by the oName
      * variable.
         this.addobject(oName,oSource.class)
         oRef=eval('this.'+oName)
         oRef.picture = oSource.picture

      * nXcoord and nYcoord are absolute form coordinates.
      * They need to be recalculated relative to the container.
        oRef.top = (nYcoord -(oRef.height/2))- this.top
        oRef.left = (nXcoord-(oRef.width/2)) - this.left

      * Addobject always sets the visible property to false (.F.).
      * This property must be reset when you are ready to display it.
        oRef.visible = .t.

      * You want only one copy or instance of the object:
        thisform.containerx1.removeobject(oName)
        oRef.dragmode = 1
        thisform.refresh
        thisform.container1pict = .f.
        thisform.container2pict = .t.

      ELSE

      * If the object already exists, you are moving it within the
      * container nXcoord and nYcoord are recalculated differently and
      * the move event is called.
      nXcoord = nXcoord - this.left
      nYcoord = nYcoord - this.top
      oSource.move((nXcoord-oSource.width/2),(nYcoord-oSource.height/2))
      oSource.visible = .t.

      ENDIF

   b. Enter the same code in DragDrop event the for Containerx1. Then edit
      the following lines of code in the DragDrop event of Containerx1:

      Containerx1 should read:
         IF thisform.container2pict = .T.
      Containerx2 should read:
         IF thisform.container1pict = .T.

      Containerx1 should read:
         thisform.containerx2.removeobject(oName)
      Containerx2 should read:
         thisform.containerx1.removeobject(oName)

      Containerx1 should read:
         thisform.container1pict = .t.
         thisform.container2pict = .f.
      Containerx2 should read:
         thisform.container1pict = .f.
         thisform.container2pict = .t.

</PRE><P><LI>Run the form. You should be able to drag the image from Containerx1 to
   Containerx2. The image should disappear from Containerx1. You should
   Then be able to move the image within Containerx2, or drag it back to
   Containerx1.
