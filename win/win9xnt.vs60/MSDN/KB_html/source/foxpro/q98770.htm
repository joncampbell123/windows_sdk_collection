The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5, 2.5a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The GraphWizard is a FoxPro for Windows application named GENGRAPH.APP. The
REFRESHGRPH procedure, which can be called from GENGRAPH.APP, allows data
in a graph saved by Microsoft FoxPro GraphWizard to be changed.
<P>
Calling the REFRESHGRPH procedure might be useful if you are experimenting
with a series of graphs using data drawn from a single query, but with
different filtering conditions. Rather than creating the graph each time in
the GraphWizard, you could create it once, save it, then direct future
query output to a table or cursor. You can then use the REFRESHGRPH
procedure to update and display the saved graph.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The correct syntax for calling REFRESHGRPH is:
<P>
<PRE>   DO REFRESHGRPH IN GENGRAPH.APP WITH &lt;expC&gt;, &lt;expN&gt;

</PRE>The clauses used with the REFRESHGRPH procedure are &lt;expC1&gt; and &lt;expN&gt;:

<UL><LI>&lt;expC1&gt; is the name of the table containing the previously saved
   graph. The GraphWizard names this table QRYGRAPH.DBF, by default.

<LI>&lt;expN&gt; is the record number containing the graph to be displayed.
<P>
</UL>The following code updates a previously saved graph using the DBF/cursor in
the current work area, and displays the updated graph. The data set that
was originally stored in the graph is replaced by the data set found in the
currently selected DBF/cursor.
<P>
REFRESHGRPH assumes that the currently selected DBF/cursor has the same
structure (for example, the same field names) as the table used to create
the graph originally. REFRESHGRPH essentially does no error checking.
REFRESHGRPH uses the MODIFY GENERAL command to display the graph specified.
The name of the graph (specified when the graph was first created) will be
used as the window title. For example:
<P>
<PRE>   DO REFRESHGRPH IN GENGRAPH.APP WITH "c:\foxprow\qrygraph.dbf",4

</PRE>This command updates record 4 in QRYGRAPH.DBF with the data found in the
currently selected DBF/cursor.
