<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When attempting to install a Visual FoxPro executable from a CD-ROM setup
disk created with the Setup Wizard, the following error may appear:
<P>
<PRE>   Insert CD-ROM Disk Labeled:
   'Disk1'
   Into Drive X:

</PRE>"Drive X:" is the drive designation of the CD-ROM drive. However, the
CD-ROM drive contains the CD-ROM disk, causing the setup program to stop.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Netsetup directory that holds the compressed files exists under another
subdirectory on the hard drive. When the Setup program attempts to
decompress the files from the CD-ROM, it cannot locate the original
directory structure that existed when the Netsetup directory was created on
the hard drive.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
While the Visual FoxPro Setup Wizard was not created with the intention of
making CD-ROM distribution disks, this error message can usually be
corrected.
<P>
Here are two workarounds:

<UL><LI>Implement the solution described in the article referenced in the
   REFERENCES section and change a line of code in the Setup.inf file
   located in the destination folder created with the Setup wizard.
<P>
   Open the Setup.inf file using any text editor and place a period
   between the last set of quotes in the following line of code:
<P>
<P><PRE>      "1","Disk 1","ACMSET16.EX_","."
</PRE><P>
   -or-

<LI>Create the Netsetup directory making sure it is located off the root
   directory of the hard drive. In the third screen of the Setup Wizard,
   Step Three-Disk Images, select the root directory of the hard drive in
   the Disk Images Directory text box.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create a project file containing a program file with a WAIT WINDOW
   command.

<P><LI>Build an executable from this project.

<P><LI>Start the Setup Wizard, build a network distributable, and save it in a
   directory under the Visual FoxPro directory.

<P><LI>Create a CD-ROM setup disk from the contents of the Netsetup directory.

<P><LI>Attempt to install the application from the CD-ROM and note that the
   error results.
<P>
</OL><h2>REFERENCES</h2>
