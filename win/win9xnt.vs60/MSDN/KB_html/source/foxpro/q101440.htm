The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro Distribution Kit for Windows, versions 2.5 and 2.5a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
SETUP.APP (the FoxPro for Windows Distribution Kit SetupWizard) prompts you
for the location of FOXW2500.ESL the first time it is run. When run later,
SETUP.APP no longer prompts for the location of FOXW25OO.ESL and
automatically includes it.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
FOXW2500.ESL is a large file (2,907,502 bytes) which can take a long time
to compress. You may not want to include it while developing your
application and experimenting with the SetupWizard.
<P>
SETUP.APP creates the DKCONTRL.DBF database and DKCONTRL.CDX index files,
which track the files to be included in the application you are creating.
The location of FOXW2500.ESL is included in the DKCONTRL database.
<P>
If you delete the DKCONTRL.DBF and DKCONTRL.CDX files (found in the same
directory as your application files), SETUP.APP rebuilds them the next time
it is run. Without the information from the DKCONTRL database, SETUP.APP
prompts you for the location of FOXW2500.ESL. Do not provide its location.
Instead, choose Continue, which allows SETUP.APP to continue without
including FOXW2500.ESL.
<P>
NOTE: If you choose the Find button and give SETUP.APP the location of
FOXW2500.ESL, it records the location in DKCONTRL and automatically
includes it in the future.
<P>
When you finish developing your application and experimenting with
SETUP.APP, run SETUP.APP a final time, providing it with the location of
FOXW2500.ESL so that it is included with your application when it is
installed on an end user's machine.
