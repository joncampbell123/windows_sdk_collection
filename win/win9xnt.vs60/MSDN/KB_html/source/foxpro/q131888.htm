The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Rules and triggers defined for a table may not fire at the expected time if
a combination of buffering and transaction processing is used.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This is by design. Rules and triggers fire when an attempt is made to write
the data in the buffer to the disk file.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Please see the sample code listed in this article.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Before running the following samples, open the Tastrade database located in
the \Vfp\samples\mainsamp\data directory, and set the default to this
directory.
<P>
All of the samples use the Customer table from Tastrade, which has a
validation rule on the cust_id field. If preferred, you can use the Orders
table instead; it has a record validation rule.
<P>
Before running any sample, issue a SET MULTILOCKS ON command in the Command
window. Each sample begins with a TABLEREVERT() command to eliminate any
records left in the data buffer from previous examples. This may cause an
error if buffering was not in effect before running the example.
<P>
The error displayed when a field fails a validation rule is 1582.
<P>
<P><h3>Code Sample One</h3>
 
<P>
The validation rule on cust_id never fires when you run this code:
<P>
<PRE>   =TABLEREVERT()
   USE customer
   =CURSORSETPROP("Buffering",3)
   APPEND BLANK
   BEGIN TRANSACTION
   ROLLBACK
   =TABLEREVERT()

</PRE>The rule never fires because the ROLLBACK and TABLEREVERT commands clear
the buffer. Because the blank record is never written to the disk file, the
validation rule on cust_id never fires.
<P>
<P><h3>Code Sample Two</h3>
 
<P>
The validation rule fires on the second APPEND BLANK command when you run
this code:
<P>
<PRE>   =TABLEREVERT()
   USE customer
   =CURSORSETPROP("Buffering",3)
   APPEND BLANK
   BEGIN TRANSACTION
   ROLLBACK
   APPEND BLANK

</PRE>This behavior occurs because, even though the ROLLBACK command discarded
the current transaction in progress, the record still existed in the
buffer. Optimistic row buffering is enabled, and Visual FoxPro
automatically attempts to write the first appended record to the table when
the record pointer is moved by the second APPEND BLANK command. To prevent
this behavior, a TABLEREVERT() should be issued immediately before or after
a ROLLBACK command.
<P>
<P><h3>Code Sample Three</h3>
 
<P>
The validation rule fires once, when the END TRANSACTION command is issued,
when you run this code:
<P>
<PRE>   =TABLEREVERT()
   USE customer
   =CURSORSETPROP("Buffering",3)
   APPEND BLANK
   BEGIN TRANSACTION
   END TRANSACTION

</PRE>The transaction doesn't commit to the table, and the record still exists in
the buffer. To prevent this behavior, test for successful execution of a
TABLEUPDATE command prior to issuing the END TRANSACTION command.
<P>
<P><h3>Code Sample Four</h3>
 
<P>
The validation rule fires twice when you run this code:
<P>
<PRE>   =TABLEREVERT()
   USE customer
   =CURSORSETPROP("Buffering",3)
   APPEND BLANK
   BEGIN TRANSACTION
   =TABLEUPDATE()
   END TRANSACTION

</PRE>An error is received only after the END TRANSACTION command is issued. The
validation rule fires once for the TABLEUPDATE command. The TABLEUPDATE
command fails, but there is no visible indication that the field failed the
validation rule. The return value from the TABLEUPDATE command was not
trapped, and the END TRANSACTION command attempts to write invalid data to
the table.
<P>
The END TRANSACTION command fires the validation rule a second time, which
results in the error 1582.
<P>
<P><h3>Code Sample Five</h3>
 
<P>
The field validation rule causes the TABLEUPDATE command to fail when you
run this code:
<P>
<PRE>   =TABLEREVERT()
   USE customer
   =CURSORSETPROP("Buffering",3)
   APPEND BLANK
   BEGIN TRANSACTION
   llDidUpdate = TABLEUPDATE()
   IF llDidUpdate
      END TRANSACTION
   ELSE
      lnRecordsDiscarded=TABLEREVERT()
      WAIT WINDOW STR(lnRecordsDiscarded) + " Records Discarded"
      ROLLBACK
   ENDIF

</PRE>The memory variable (llDidUpdate) contains false (.F.), which indicates
that the TABLEUPDATE command failed. The validation error never appears on
the screen, and a message indicating that one record was discarded appears.
<P>
This approach demonstrates the recommended approach to combining buffering
and transaction processing. The return value from the TABLEUPDATE command
should be tested, and the END TRANSACTION command issued only if the
TABLEUPDATE command was successful.
