<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In the Data Designer, when you drag the mouse from one table to another
to draw a one-to-many relationship:

<UL><LI>The cursor does not change and no relation is drawn.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>The relationship is one-to-one and cannot be set to one-to-many.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The relationships established in the Database Designer are persistent and
are used for data integrity. A persistent relation is established from tag
to tag, and the nature of the tag determines the type of relationship
created.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
You must have an index created in both the source and target tables before
a relationship may be established. The type of relationship that is created
is determined by the type of index in the target (child) table. To create a
one-to-many relationship, the key index type in the target table must be
set to 'regular'. The following pointers may be helpful when creating
relationships between tables.
<P>
Ensure that you are dragging the mouse from an index tag to an index tag,
and verify that the key you are using in the source (parent) table is not a
regular key.
<P>
If you want to create a one-to-many relationship, verify that the key in
the target table is not a candidate or primary key. These types of indexes
require that no two records have the same value. It is therefore impossible
to have a candidate or a primary key as the target for a one-to-many
relationship.
<P>
Once you set the relationship, it is shown in the Database Designer as a
line connecting the two tables.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior by design.
