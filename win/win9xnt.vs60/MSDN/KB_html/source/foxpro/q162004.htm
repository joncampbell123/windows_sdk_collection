   TITLE     : How to Obtain Microsoft Support Files from Online Services

</PRE>Here is the Readme.txt file from the updated Setup Wizard files, which
includes instructions to install the updated files and the problems
addressed.
<P>
<P><h3>Setup Wizard Update Readme</h3>
 
<P>
The Visual FoxPro Setup Wizard has been updated to address a number of
known issues. This update runs only under version 5.0 of Visual FoxPro. Do
not use it in Visual FoxPro 3.0 or previous releases.
<P>
Use the following steps to install the Setup Wizard update:

<OL><P><LI>Replace the existing files in the following locations with the updated
   files:
<P>
<PRE>    File           Location
    ----           --------
    Wzsetup.app    \Vfp\Wizards
    Wizset32.dll   \Vfp\Distrib.Src\Setup
    Clireg32.exe   \Vfp

   NOTE: If these files are not installed, then first rerun the Visual
   FoxPro 5.0 Setup, select Custom Install, choose Professional
   Applications, and choose the Microsoft Visual FoxPro Runtime and Setup
   Wizard component options.

</PRE><P><LI>Search your hard drive for other copies of Clireg32.exe and replace them
   with the new version. This file is a common component that other
   applications such as Visual Basic also use.

<P><LI>If you have already run the Visual FoxPro 5.0 Setup Wizard, delete the
   "\Vfp\Distrib" directory and all occurrences of the following files:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Dkcontrl.dbf
      Dkcontrl.cdx
      Wzsetup.ini
</PRE><P>
</OL>The Setup Wizard will automatically re-create these the next time you run
it.
<P>
<P><h3>Updated Features</h3>
 
<P>
The Setup Wizard accommodates the latest version of Clireg32.exe, which now
supports remote automation via Distributed COM (DCOM). There is a new
option in the Custom OLE Servers Details dialog box for selecting DCOM. If
you select this option, you must ensure that the machine onto which you are
installing your distributed application supports DCOM.
<P>
<P><h3>Known Issues Addressed</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>The maximum number of files created for a disk image sometimes exceeds
   the DOS root directory limit. This affects only disk images that have
   more than 112 files per image.

<P><LI>When using a Visual FoxPro 3.0 setup, the default directory in Step 5
   contains a drive letter. Generating disk images appends an extra drive
   letter to this directory, creating corrupt disk images. Tabbing into and
   out of the Default Directory text box also eliminates the problem.

<P><LI>Installation of newly created disk images sometimes fails if you select
   the Directory only option in Step 5 and choose a Program Item for a file
   on Step 6.

<P><LI>The Setup Wizard now generates a Registry key for international
   platforms using localized versions of the runtime resource file (for
   example, Vfp5enu.dll). This bypasses potential problems when installing
   a localized (non-US) runtime resource file onto an operating system
   whose locale ID is different.
<P>
   NOTE: This issue does not affect disk images created using the
   Vfp5enu.dll resource file.

<P><LI>The Setup Wizard now generates registry keys to support certain ActiveX
   controls such as Microsoft's Web Browser when using ActiveX Dual
   Interface Support. See the SYS(2333) function.

<P><LI>The Setup Wizard has been updated to generate registry keys compatible
   with Microsoft Office 97.

<P><LI>A problem was corrected using SETUP /F with installs onto Novell
   networks. This involved using long names for Program Group and Program
   Item Description.
<P>
   NOTE: The Visual FoxPro version 5.0x setup wizard no longer supports the
   /F switch.

<P><LI>The Setup Wizard no longer generates disk images that prompt the user to
   select a location for ODBC Start Menu items. Access ODBC components
   through the Control Panel.
