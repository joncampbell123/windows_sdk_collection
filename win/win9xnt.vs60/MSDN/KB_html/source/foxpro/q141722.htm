</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In a grid object, the default behavior allows a user to resize the header
by clicking and dragging it. The grid header could potentially be pulled
down so that it covers the entire grid object and all of the data contained
within it. This article demonstrates how to use program code to prevent a
user from resizing the header of a grid.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following example creates a new property for the form to store the
original size of the grid's HeaderHeight Property. Then, in the MouseUp
event of the grid, the HeaderHeight Property is reset to its the original
size should a user attempt to change it while running the form.
<P>
<P><h3>Step-by-Step Example</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create a new form.

<P><LI>On the Form menu, click New Property, and create a property called
   oldheadheight.

<P><LI>Place the following code in the Init event of the form:
<P>
   THIS.oldheadheight=THISFORM.Grid1.HeaderHeight

<P><LI>Add the Customer table to the Data Environment of the form (on the View
   menu, click Data Environment, and then right-click within the Data
   Environment and select Add. Within the Add Table or View dialog box,
   select Other and locate the Customer.dbf as follows:
<P>
   C:\Vfp\Samples\Data\Customer.dbf

<P><LI>Click the title bar of the Customer table, and drag it onto the form to
   create a grid.

<P><LI>With the grid as the selected object on the form, set the ColumnCount
   property to 4.

<P><LI>Add the following code to the MouseUp event of the grid:
<P>
   THIS.HeaderHeight=THISFORM.oldheadheight

<P><LI>Save the form as Test. Close it, and use the DO FORM command to run
   the form.

<P><LI>Attempt to resize the header by clicking and dragging from the top, left
   corner of the grid and notice that it snaps back to its original
   position once the mouse button is released.
