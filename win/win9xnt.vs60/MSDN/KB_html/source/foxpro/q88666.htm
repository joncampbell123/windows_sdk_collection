The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS, versions 2.0, 2.5, and 2.5a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If you are having a problem printing, the following procedure can help
you to establish what is causing the problem.

<OL><P><LI>From the Window menu, choose Debug.

<P><LI>In the left side of the Debug window, type the variables in the
   left column below:
<P>
<PRE>      SYS(6)          &amp;&amp; Printer Device
      SYS(13)         &amp;&amp; Printer Status
      SYS(101)        &amp;&amp; Device Setting
      SYS(102)        &amp;&amp; Printer Setting
      SYS(2005)       &amp;&amp; Resource File in use
      _GENPD          &amp;&amp; GENPD.APP in use
      _PDRIVER        &amp;&amp; Printer Driver File
      _PDSETUP        &amp;&amp; Printer Driver Setup

</PRE></OL>Specific printing problems and what to check:

<UL><LI>Report is printing ASCII characters or is not using the printer
   driver setup you want.
<P>
   1. Before you call up your report, check _PDSETUP in DEBUG and see
<P><PRE>      what printer driver setup, if any, is selected. Then, modify
      your report while DEBUG is still open and check to see if
      _PDSETUP changes. If so, then you have specified a printer
      driver in your report.
</PRE><P>
   2. If the driver you want to use is the one specified in your
<P><PRE>      report, include keyword PDSETUP following your command to print
      the report. For example:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>         REPORT FORM &lt;name) TO PRINT PDSETUP

   3. If the driver you want to use is the one specified by your
      environment, (either in your CONFIG.FP file or by issuing the
      command SET PDSETUP TO "&lt;name of setup&gt;", DO NOT use the keyword
      PDSETUP when you issue the PRINT command. For example:

         REPORT FORM &lt;name&gt; TO PRINT

</PRE><LI>Printing options are dimmed (unavailable).
<P>
   1. Check _GENPD in your Debug window to see if GENPD.APP can be
<P><PRE>      located. GENPD.APP must be available in order to print.
</PRE><P>
   2. If you are distributing an .EXE file, GENPD.APP must be included in
<P><PRE>      the project and marked as Excluded. To do this, modify your project,
      choose Add, select Application and locate GENPD.APP. FoxPro should
      automatically mark GENPD.APP as excluded. GENPD.APP, DRIVER2.PLB,
      PSAPI.PLB, FOXSWAP.COM, and PROAPI16.EXE (if on an 80386 machine)
      must then be distributed with your .EXE file.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      NOTE: PROAPI16.EXE is no longer needed with FoxPro versions 2.5 and
      later.
</PRE>
<LI>Report is printing ASCII characters instead of boxes.
<P>
   Printer drivers were updated with patches of new releases. Make
   sure you have applied the latest patches. If you are using the latest
   release of the drivers and you are still having this problem, the
   setup is trying to print with the IBM character set. In this case,
   you have the following choices:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Choose a printer font on your printer that will print the IBM
      character set. For example, on a Hewlett-Packard printer, choose
      PC-8.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      -or-
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - Modify the P_CODES.DBF P_startup to include the escape sequence
      needed to place your printer in the font that will use the IBM
      character set.
</PRE>
<LI>ASCII text files are not using your printer driver setup.
<P>
<P><PRE>    - ASCII text files will not use selected printer drivers. They will
      always use the generic text printer driver (the default printer
      setting).
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - ASCII text files will not use any user-defined functions (UDFs)
      you have created.
