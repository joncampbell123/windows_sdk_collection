The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, versions 2.5b, 2.5c, 2.6a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In FoxPro for the Macintosh, you can run the query that appears in the
selection box. To run a different query, modify the query in the selection
box. You cannot select existing queries from the file selection box. Those
queries are grayed out. In FoxPro for Windows, you can select existing
queries.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The query selection box was designed to provide a means of creating a
simple query on the fly. It was not intended to allow access to multiple
queries previously designed. This is described in the Macintosh Foxpro
Developer's Guide on page 309. The description of the Query selection under
the Application menu says "Displays a dialog so that you can create a
Query." The Windows Developer's Guide has the same description.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce this Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create a simple application using FoxApp.

<P><LI>Run the application created, and select Query from the Application
   popup.

<P><LI>A default name (the same name as the application) appears for a new
   query in the dialog window.

<P><LI>Any other queries in the file selection box above are grayed out and
   cannot be selected.

<P><LI>Change the default name, design a query, and save it.

<P><LI>After closing the query, select Query from the Application popup. The
   default name will still appear in the selected box, and you will be
   unable to select the query designed above.
