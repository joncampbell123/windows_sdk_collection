The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, version 2.6a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Compact executables created in FoxPro for windows are expected to run
independently when installed in a directory that contains the FoxPro
library file (FPW2600.ESL). However, some executables that run within the
FoxPro development environment fail to run when moved to a separate
directory in windows. Double-clicking the file doesn't generate any result,
and there is no error message to indicate its failure to run.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
One possible cause of these symptoms is the naming convention used for the
executable file. If the name of the executable file is identical to a
Windows system file such as USER.EXE, GDI.EXE, or KERNEL.EXE, the
executable won't run outside the FoxPro development environment. These
names are not reserved words in FoxPro, however, users who give their
application similar names will be able to run them within FoxPro but will
have problems in Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Rename the application file.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create an executable named USER.EXE from any project (.PJX) file in
   FoxPro for Windows.

<P><LI>Create a new directory in Windows and move the following files to that
   that directory:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - USER.EXE (the executable created from the project file)
    - FPW2600.ESL (the FoxPro library file)
    - Any other files required to run the executable such as .DBF or .CDX
      files.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Try running the Executable file by double-clicking it in File Manager.
<P>
</OL>NOTE : This condition is true for executables with these names created in
FoxPro for MS-DOS that run under Windows from the File Manager. However,
the problem will not occur if the same file is run from the MS-DOS prompt.
