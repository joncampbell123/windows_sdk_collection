The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS, version 2.6
<LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, version 2.6
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
You cannot use a FoxPro wizard to modify a screen, label, or query even
though that screen, label, or query was created by a FoxPro wizard.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The screen, label, or query has been modified by a FoxPro power tool.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Once a FoxPro power tool has been used to modify a screen, label, or query
that was created by a FoxPro wizard, the item cannot subsequently be
modified by a wizard. The Screen, Label, and Query Wizards were not
designed to modify screens, labels, or queries that have been used with the
Screen Builder, Label Designer, and Relational Query By Example (RQBE)
power tools.
<P>
If you attempt to modify a screen, label, or query from within the Catalog
Manager by choosing the Modify button and that screen, label, or query was
created with a wizard (and not subsequently touched by a power tool), the
Catalog Manager will produce a window in which you can choose to edit the
screen, label, or query with a wizard or with a power tool.
<P>
If you attempt to modify a screen, label, or query from within the Catalog
Manager by choosing the Modify button and that screen, label, or query was
created with a wizard but has subsequently been touched by a power tool (or
was created with a power tool), the Catalog Manager will launch the
appropriate power tool. The intermediate window described above is not
presented under these circumstances.
