<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Sometimes it is useful to have report output directed to a file first and
printed at a later time. When this is done, the printer commands are
embedded in the text of the file at the time the report is executed. This
file can then be printed directly from Visual FoxPro to either PCL or
PostScript printers.
<P>
This can be done at the time a report is created (design mode or from the
Report Wizard) or after the report is saved (programatically or from the
Print dialog box). There are only a few steps to print to a file, and the
steps are similar under the Windows, Windows 95, and Windows NT operating
systems.
<P>

<P><h3>Step-by-Step Procedure</h3>
 
<P>
Follow your Windows User's guide to install any new printers. Once a
printer is installed, create a new printer of the same type, and connect it
to the File: port. Set this printer up to be the default printer. As your
default printer, any new reports will be printed directly to a file along
with any printer-specific language. You can create a report with the Report
Wizard or the Report Designer.
<P>
When you save a report, the printer driver and printer output device
information are stored in the internal structure of the report. When a
report is saved and the output device is File:, the printer driver and
printer output device settings are saved with the report. So each time a
report is printed, the user is be prompted for a file name and the report
is printed to a file.
<P>
To print the files, first check that the destination printer is the same as
the printer used during report creation. Then from the Print Setup dialog
box, verify that the default printer is now connected to a real printer
port such as LPT1. Next, issue the print command or click Print on the File
menu.
<P>
In the Type list, click ASCII File. You receive a warning that the file
will be sent directly to the printer and should have all printer-specific
language in the file. Enter the file name, and click OK. The file will be
sent to the printer and printed exactly the as if the report had been sent
directly to the printer.
