The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Windows NT, Windows version 3.1, and Windows for Workgroups, removing
all Visual FoxPro files by using the Visual FoxPro Setup program does not
remove the main Visual FoxPro directories and related subdirectories. Also,
in Windows NT and Windows 95, registry information is not removed.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This is by design. The Visual FoxPro directory tree is not removed for
safety reasons. Removing the directory tree could also delete user files
and adding in the algorithm to check for user files versus FoxPro files
would have added an additional level of complexity to the removal option.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
After the removal process has completed, you can delete the directory where
Visual FoxPro was installed by using File Manager.
<P>
To remove the Registry entries in Windows 95 and Windows NT, you need to
delete the Visual FoxPro key and all its subkeys by using the Registry
Editor. Microsoft does not support the use of the Registry Editor, so you
are urged to exercise extreme caution when working with the registry files.
The Visual FoxPro registry entries are found in HKEY_CURRENT_USER on Local
Machine in the Microsoft folder.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The README help file distributed with Visual FoxPro provides the following
information. Note that the last sentence of the first paragraph is
incorrect:
<P>
<PRE>   To remove Visual FoxPro from a hard disk in Windows for Workgroups
   or Windows NT, double-click the Setup icon in the Visual FoxPro program
   group. Then choose Remove All from the Visual FoxPro Setup dialog box.
   This process does not remove user files.

   CAUTION: Though the removal procedure offers several opportunities to
   keep files or shared components, it offers no final warning before it
   starts to delete all Visual FoxPro files. Press ESC to stop the removal
   process.

</PRE>Any user-created files stored in the Visual FoxPro installation directory
are removed. To preserve these files, you must move them to a different
directory location before running Setup.
<P>
In Windows 95, this behavior is somewhat different in that the removal
process does prompt for the deletion of the directory tree. This is done
as part of the requirements for Windows 95 certification.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 
<P>
Run the Visual FoxPro Setup program contained in the Visual FoxPro program
group, and choose Remove all. When the software has been removed, start the
File Manager and verify that the directory where Visual FoxPro was
installed is still present.
