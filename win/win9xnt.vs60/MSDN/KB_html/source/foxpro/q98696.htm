The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5 and 2.5a
<LI>Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS, versions 1.02, 2.0, 2.5, and 2.5a
</UL> 
<P>
In FoxPro, if a database has a UNIQUE index and a record is deleted but the
database is not packed, any additional undeleted records that have the same
key value as the deleted record will not be accessed by FoxPro while the
UNIQUE index is the controlling index. SET DELETED OFF will display the
deleted record; SET DELETED ON will not display any records with the
deleted key field.
<P>
In order to use the INDEX ON ... UNIQUE command and maintain the ability to
use all valid undeleted records in the database, include an IIF statement
in the index that identifies all deleted records. For example:
<P>
<PRE>   INDEX ON IIF(DELETED(),"0","1")+CNO TO TEST.IDX UNIQUE

</PRE>This command causes all the deleted records to be placed first if SET
DELETED ON is in effect. If SET DELETED OFF is in effect, all undeleted
UNIQUE records will be ordered on the CNO field.
<P>
NOTE: When a UNIQUE index (or index tag) is active and a duplicate record
is changed in a way that affects its index key, the index or index tag is
updated. However, the next duplicate record with the ORIGINAL index key
cannot be accessed or displayed until you have reindexed the file. If a
record is deleted or changed once the index has been created, the index
must be REINDEXED to reflect these changes.
