<LI>Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS, version 2.5
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Distributed applications require certain FoxPro files, but these files do
not need to be included in every FoxPro application. Installing these files
separately will save disk space if several FoxPro applications are run on a
single system. In addition, your projects can be created as compact
executable files, free of the required files that are not part of your
project, and the distribution disks will take less time to create, since
you can exclude the .ESL files from the disk-creation process.
<P>
See below for a procedure that explains how to streamline the distribution
process in this manner.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To streamline the process of generating FoxPro applications, especially on
the Windows platform, it is best to create an application that installs
only the required files, and then manually modify the AUTOEXEC.BAT to
include the directory where the FoxPro files are stored.
<P>
To do this:

<OL><P><LI>Create a project called Master by typing the following command in the
   Command window:
<P>
<P><PRE>      MODIFY PROJECT master
</PRE>
<P><LI>Choose the Add button and select Program from the Type list.

<P><LI>Choose the New button, and name the program Null. This program should
   contain the following line by itself:
<P>
<P><PRE>      *This is all that is in this application, a comment.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Create a directory called FOXRUN, and include this directory in the PATH
   statement in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

<P><LI>Put all files that are required (the FOX*.ES* files and any
   distributable fonts or general utilities that your application may
   require) in the FOXRUN directory.

<P><LI>Build image disks for the Master project.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: For FoxPro for Windows, use the SetupWizard to create the necessary
compressed files for all disk formats.
<P>
You can now install the Master application and modify the AUTOEXEC.BAT path
statement to point to the FOXRUN directory. This directory will contain
just the FOX*.ES* file(s) and will make the required changes to the proper
*.INI files.
