The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5a and 2.5b
<LI>Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS, versions 2.5a and 2.5b
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When two WAIT WINDOW commands are issued from a program, one after the
other, if each command displays a different number of lines in the wait
window and if the first command has the NOWAIT clause, the wait window that
is activated last is not displayed properly.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this behavior, do one of the following:

<UL><LI>Insert the WAIT CLEAR command between the two WAIT WINDOW commands.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Remove the NOWAIT clause from the first WAIT WINDOW command.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following two code examples further explain this situation.
<P>
<P><h3>Example 1</h3>
 
<P>
The following code example illustrates the behavior of the second wait
window when it is defined to display more lines than the first window.
<P>
<PRE>   WAIT WINDOW NOWAIT "WinOne Line1"+CHR(13)+"WinOne Line2"
   WAIT WINDOW "WinTwo Line1"+CHR(13)+"WinTwo Line2" ;
               +CHR(13)+"WinTwo Line3"

</PRE>When the above code is executed, the second wait window takes on the
characteristics of and displays the same number of lines as the first wait
window. Starting with the first line, the second wait window displays only
as many lines as are displayed by the first wait window; the rest of the
lines are not displayed. Therefore, "WinTwo Line1" and "WinTwo Line2" are
displayed, whereas "WinTwo Line3" is not.
<P>
<P><h3>Example 2</h3>
 
<P>
The following code example illustrates the behavior of the second wait
window when it is defined to display fewer lines than the first window.
<P>
<PRE>   WAIT WINDOW NOWAIT "WinOne Line1"+CHR(13)+"WinOne Line2" ;
                    +CHR(13)+"WinOne Line3"
   WAIT WINDOW "WinTwo Line1"+CHR(13)+"WinTwo Line2"

</PRE>When the above code is executed, the second window is the same size as the
first window and displays extra blank lines. In the second wait window, the
number of "Displayed Lines+Blank Lines" is the same as the total number of
lines displayed by the first wait window. Therefore, the second wait window
will display "WinTwo Line1", "WinTwo Line1" and a blank line.
<P>
NOTE: In FoxPro versions 2.5a and 2.5b for MS-DOS, both of the above code
examples display only the last line of the second wait window. This
behavior is the same whether both WAIT WINDOW commands display the same or
a different number of lines.
