<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
To install Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS on a machine running IBM OS/2
version 2.0, do one of the following:

<UL><LI>Boot the computer with an MS-DOS disk in drive A and install FoxPro
   from drive B.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>At an OS/2 prompt (either windowed or full screen), type the following
   command:
<P>
<P><PRE>      boot /dos
</PRE><P>
   After the machine restarts with MS-DOS as the primary operating system,
   run the FoxPro installation program.
<P>
   NOTE: Erratic behavior and system lockups can occur when you attempt to
   install FoxPro in an OS/2 2.0 MS-DOS window.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>If the Boot Manager feature of OS/2 is installed, shut down and restart
   the machine. Select MS-DOS from the Boot Manager list. After the MS-DOS
   boot process completes, run the FoxPro installation program.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
OS/2 version 2.0 has a Boot Manager feature that supports multiple disk
partitions that have different operating systems. The OS/2 Fdisk program
partitions the drive into several drives, one of which is approximately one
megabyte to hold the Boot Manager software. Once the user makes an
operating system selection, the Boot Manager reassigns drive C to the
selected partition and passes control to the initialization (boot strap)
routine.
<P>
OS/2 version 2.0 also has a dual-boot feature that allows the user to boot
the computer with MS-DOS as the primary operating system. Dual boot is
implemented by renaming the OS/2 COMMAND.COM and CONFIG.SYS files to an
alternate name. After the system renames the MS-DOS versions of these files
from their alternate names, control passes to the initialization procedure
in the ROM BIOS.
