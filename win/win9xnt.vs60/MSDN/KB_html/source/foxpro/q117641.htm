The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0
<LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5a, 2.5b, 2.6
<LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, versions 2.5b, 2.5c
</UL> 
<P>
NOTE: This does not apply to FoxPro 2.5 for Windows.
<P>
In a distributed application, you may want to completely suppress the title
that appears in the title bar of the FoxPro desktop window. You can do this
programmatically by using the MODIFY WINDOW SCREEN command and including
the keyword TITLE followed by a character string expression for the title.
However, the MODIFY WINDOW SCREEN command changes the main desktop title
only after the executable program has complete control. As a result, the
Microsoft FoxPro title is briefly displayed in the title bar before it is
replaced by the new title specified with the MODIFY WINDOW command.
<P>
To work around this behavior, you must change the title of the desktop
window before program control begins. The only way to do this is to use the
TITLE = command in the CONFIG.FPW or CONFIG.FPM configuration file. For
example:
<P>
<PRE>   TITLE = This is my title

</PRE>NOTE: Do not enclose the application title in quotation marks. If quotation
marks are used, they are considered part of the title and will be displayed
in the title bar along with the text of the title.
<P>
Adding the TITLE = command to a configuration file used by a distributed
executable program will suppress the Microsoft FoxPro title completely and
retain the specified title until it is changed under program control.
Adding this line to a configuration file used by FoxPro will suppress the
Microsoft FoxPro title in FoxPro for Windows and FoxPro for Macintosh.
<P>
NOTE: This command will not have quite the same effect in the FoxPro
development environment. Although it will change the title of the desktop,
the Microsoft FoxPro title bar will be briefly displayed at first.
