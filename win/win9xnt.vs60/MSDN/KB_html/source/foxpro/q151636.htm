The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When using Microsoft Imager to insert an Imager object into a Microsoft
Visual FoxPro for Power Macintosh general field, the machine may hang or
crash with a "Bus Error" or a "Type 10 Error."
<P>
If the machine hangs, you will be forced to press CMD+OPT+ESC and Force
Quit Imager. If you have to Force Quit Imager, Visual FoxPro then returns
the message:
<P>
<PRE>   OLE error: Application started but did not register a class factory.

</PRE>This typically occurs with large images.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The OLE error "Application started but did not register a class factory" is
a symptom of low memory. Either the memory partition allocated for
Microsoft Imager or the memory partition allocated for Visual FoxPro is too
small to perform the requested operation.
<P>
When dealing with Microsoft Imager, the problem usually occurs because the
image is too large to load into the memory partition of Microsoft Imager.
This can be determined by trying to insert a small image into a general
field, something the size of "Fox.pct" in the Microsoft Visual FoxPro main
folder. If this behavior succeeds, then the problem could be due to the
size of the image you are trying to insert.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Increase the Preferred Size for both Imager and Visual FoxPro. Start by
doubling the Preferred Size for Imager. If this does not solve the problem,
then begin increasing the Preferred Size of Visual FoxPro in 1024K
increments until the image is successfully inserted into the general field.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Steps to Reproduce Problem
 

<OL><P><LI>Load Microsoft Imager and open a large image (something that is over
   half a megabyte in size and at least 256 colors).

<P><LI>From the Microsoft Imager menu, select View, and then select Summary
   Info. Check to ensure that the image's DPI setting is 72. If it is not
   72, change the DPI to 72 and choose OK. (This step is necessary for
   Visual FoxPro to display the image correctly.)

<P><LI>From the File menu, select Save As, and then save the file using the
   PICT file type. Name the file TEST.PCT.

<P><LI>Exit Microsoft Imager and load Visual FoxPro. To test whether
   Visual FoxPro can display the image correctly, type the following in the
   Command window:
<P>
<P><PRE>      _SCREEN.Picture=TEST.PCT
</PRE><P>
   and you should see the image tiled in the desktop.

<P><LI>Create a table containing a general field. Browse the table and add a
   record by pressing the CTRL+Y keys.

<P><LI>From the Edit menu, select Insert Object. Select From File, and then
   find and select TEST.PCT.
<P>
</OL>If the image is large enough, you will see Visual FoxPro appear to hang.
Actually, it is Microsoft Imager that has hung, because it does not have
enough memory available to continue with the process. You need to Force
Quit the MS Imager and increase the Preferred Memory size of Microsoft
Imager, as instructed above, and try again.
