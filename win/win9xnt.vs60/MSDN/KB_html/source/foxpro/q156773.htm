The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Visual FoxPro 5.0, the COPY TO &lt;filename&gt; DELIMITED WITH BLANK command
places quotation marks around character fields and preserves leading blank
spaces within character fields. Other versions of FoxPro create text files
that are slightly different in their format. You should be aware of the
possible differences if you use this command under a previous version of
FoxPro to port to Visual FoxPro 5.0.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
If the character fields do not need quotation marks around them, use the
COPY TO &lt;filename&gt; TYPE SDF command.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Different versions of FoxPro produce slightly different text files using
the same command. Depending on the version, leading spaces may be truncated
or quotation marks may be added to character fields. For example, COPY TO
&lt;filename&gt; DELIMITED WITH BLANK in FoxPro 2.6a for Windows produces a text
file that does not contain quotation marks around the character fields. If
a character field contains leading spaces, they remain. However, Visual
FoxPro 3.0b exhibits different behavior. The text file contains no
quotation marks around the character fields and leading spaces are trimmed
from the fields.
<P>
Visual FoxPro 5.0 produces a text file that preserves leading spaces and
places quotation marks around each character field. This is the intended
behavior of the product.
<P>
The following text comes from the "COPY TO" Help file topic:
<P>
<PRE>   DELIMITED   Creates a delimited file. A delimited file is an ASCII text
   file in which each record ends with a carriage return and linefeed. The
   default field separator is a comma. Since character data may include
   commas, character fields are additionally delimited with double
   quotation marks.

</PRE><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create a table in the Command window by typing:
<P>
   CREATE TABLE test (ctest C (30))

<P><LI>In the Command window, type the following commands:
<P>
   INSERT INTO test (ctest) VALUE ('This is a test')
<PRE>   INSERT INTO test (ctest) VALUE ('    This is another test')
   INSERT INTO test (ctest) VALUE ('   This is a third test')

</PRE><P><LI>Create a text file by typing the following command in the Command
   window:
<P>
   COPY TO test.txt DELIMITED WITH BLANK

<P><LI>Open the text file by typing the following in the Command window:
<P>
   MODIFY COMMAND test.txt
<P>
</OL>Note that the leading spaces are preserved and each field is surrounded by
quotation marks.
