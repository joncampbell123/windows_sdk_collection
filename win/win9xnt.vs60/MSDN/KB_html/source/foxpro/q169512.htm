The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a
   on the following platforms: NT, Win95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When a Visual FoxPro control, such a text box or command button, is placed
on a page of the Microsoft ActiveX Tabbed Dialog Control, version 5.0, it
shows on all pages of the Tabbed Dialog Control. This is true even if the
Tabbed Dialog Control is put in edit mode before placing the Visual FoxPro
control on it.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Use the Visual FoxPro PageFrame base class or the SSTab Object ActiveX
control that shipped with Visual FoxPro 5.0--version 4.01.0000 of
Tabctl32.ocx.
<P>
If Visual FoxPro 5.0a has been installed and the ActiveX controls have been
updated to the ones that it installs, the older SSTab Object control can
replace the newer version. Before following the steps below to do this, be
sure to consider whether or not there are other applications, like Visual
Basic 5.0, that may make use of the Microsoft Tabbed Dialog Control,
version 5.0.

<OL><P><LI>Obtain version 4.01.0000 of Tabctl32.ocx. If the Visual FoxPro
   5.0 CD is available, it can be copied directly from the CD as the
   files are not compressed.

<P><LI>Rename the 5.00.3714 version of Tabctl32.ocx as Tabctl32.50a, and then
   copy the 4.01.0000 version into either the Win95\System or
   WinNT\System32 folder depending on the operating system.

<P><LI>Start Visual FoxPro. From the Tools menu, select Options and click the
   Controls tab.

<P><LI>Ensure that the ActiveX controls option button is selected and also
   that the Controls check box is selected.

<P><LI>Locate the Microsoft Tabbed Dialog Control, version 5.0, and clear
   the check box to the left of it.

<P><LI>Click Add and navigate to the appropriate Windows\System folder and
   select the Tabctl32.ocx file.

<P><LI>In the list of Controls, find the SSTab Object and select the check box
   to the left of it.

<P><LI>Click Set As Default and then OK to exit the Options dialog box.

<P><LI>To verify that the 4.01.0000 version of the .ocx file is being used,
   follow the Steps to Reproduce Behavior section below, substituting
   the SSTab Object control in place of the Microsoft Tabbed Dialog
   Control.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When adding a control to a Visual FoxPro PageFrame or the Tabbed Dialog
Control, a common mistake is to not put the PageFrame or tabbed dialog into
edit mode by right-clicking it and selecting Edit from the Shortcut menu.
Controls placed on the Microsoft Tabbed Dialog Control, version 5.0, show
on all pages of the control even if it was placed in edit mode before
adding the control to the page. This does not happen with the SSTab Object
ActiveX control that shipped with Visual FoxPro 5.0 or the Visual FoxPro
PageFrame base class. Controls placed on the Microsoft Tabbed Dialog
Control, version 5.0, in Visual Basic 5.0 show only on the page they are
placed on.
<P>
As it was mentioned above, version 5.0 and 5.0a of Visual FoxPro install
different versions of the tabbed dialog ActiveX control. Both .ocx files
are named Tabctl32.ocx. Visual FoxPro 5.0 installs version 4.01.0000 of
Tabctl32.ocx file and Visual FoxPro 5.0a installs version 5.00.3714. To
check the version, find and select the Tabctl32.ocx in the WinNT\System32
or Win95\System folder and select Properties from the File menu, shortcut
menu (if right-clicked) or press ALT+Enter with the file selected. You can
also check the ActiveX controls loaded in the Controls tab in the Tools,
Options dialog box. Version 4.01.0000 of Tabctl32.ocx will show up as SSTab
Object in the list of controls. Version 5.00.3714 will show as Microsoft
Tabbed Dialog Control, version 5.0.
<P>
ActiveX controls are normally placed on Visual FoxPro forms using the OLE
Container Control.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Determine which version of the Tabctl32.ocx file is being used by Visual
   FoxPro. See above for instructions on how to do this. Visual FoxPro 5.0a
   and the ActiveX controls that shipped with it will normally need to be
   installed to reproduce the problem.

<P><LI>In Visual FoxPro 5.0a, create a new form.

<P><LI>Add an OLE Container Control to the form. From the Insert menu, select
   Object, and select the Insert Control option button to show the ActiveX
   controls. Click the Microsoft Tabbed Dialog Control, version 5.0 from
   the list.

<P><LI>Right-click on the Tabbed Dialog control and select Edit from the
   Shortcut menu that appears.

<P><LI>Add a Visual FoxPro control such as a text box or command button to one
   of the pages of the tabbed dialog. If the drop-down list at the top of
   the Properties sheet is clicked, the objects added to the tabbed
   dialog should show as indented underneath Olecontrol1--the default
   name given to the Tabbed Dialog control when it was placed on the
   form.

<P><LI>Click on the tabs of the Tabbed Dialog control. The objects should
   show on all the pages. Save and run the form and the behavior should
   be the same.
