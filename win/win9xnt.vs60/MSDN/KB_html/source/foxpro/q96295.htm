The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5 and 2.5a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The SET READBORDER command is not listed in the manuals that come with
FoxPro 2.5 for Windows. Information on SET READBORDER is in Help, but
this command was not implemented when the manuals were published. This
command is for FoxPro for Windows only; it will not work in FoxPro 2.5
for MS-DOS. FoxPro 2.5 for MS-DOS will ignore the SET READBORDER
command, so it should not cause a coding error.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In FoxPro for Windows, SET READBORDER specifies if single-line borders
are placed around editing regions created with @ ... GET commands. SET
READBORDER is ignored in FoxPro for MS-DOS.
<P>
If SET READBORDER is ON, a single-line border is placed around all
editing regions created with @ ... GET commands. If SET READBORDER is
ON when the first @ ... GET command is issued, all subsequent @ ...
GETs created in the same READ level also have borders.
<P>
If SET READBORDER is OFF, a border isn't placed around editing regions
created with @ ... GET command. If SET READBORDER is OFF when the
first @ ... GET command is issued, all subsequent @ ... GETs created
in the same READ level do not have borders.
<P>
The default for SET READBORDER is OFF.
<P>
<P><h3>Example</h3>
 
<P>
In the following example, the first three editing regions created with
@ ... GET have borders. The third editing region has a border even
though SET READBORDER was set to OFF before it was created. The fourth
editing region does not have a border since READBORDER was set to OFF
and it is encompassed in a different READ than the first three editing
regions.
<P>
<PRE>   SET READBORDER ON

   @ 2,2 GET w DEFAULT 1   &amp;&amp; 1st READ
   @ 4,2 GET x DEFAULT 1   &amp;&amp; 1st READ

   SET READBORDER OFF

   @ 6,2 GET y DEFAULT 1   &amp;&amp; 1st READ
   READ

   @ 8,2 GET z DEFAULT 2   &amp;&amp; 2nd READ
   READ
