<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In Visual FoxPro, a text box can have a recessed look to it by setting the
SpecialEffect property to 3D-Effect. There is no setting to make the text
box have a raised look. However, by using lines with contrasting colors on
each side of the text box, you can give the text box a raised look on the
form. The best colors for making a text box have a raised look are light
gray for the left and top sides and dark gray for the bottom and right
sides. Below are the steps to create a raised text box.

<P>
<P><h3>Step-by-Step Procedure</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create a form and add a text box to it. Change the SpecialEffect
   property of the text box to 1 - Plain.

<P><LI>Select the Line tool from the Form Controls toolbar. Draw a line equal
   to the length of the text box. You can press SHIFT+RIGHT ARROW or
   SHIFT+LEFT ARROW to make it easy to adjust the line length.

<P><LI>After making the line equal to the length of the text box, make a copy
   of it by pressing CTRL+C and then pressing CTRL+V.

<P><LI>Repeat steps 2 and 3 to create two lines equal to the width of the
   text box.

<P><LI>Click the first long line, and change the Border Color property in the
   Properties sheet to 192,192,192. Using the mouse or arrow keys, overlap
   this line to the top border line of the text box.

<P><LI>Repeat Step 5 for the first width line, using the mouse or arrow key to
   overlap this line to the left border line of the text box.

<P><LI>Click the second long line, changing the Border Color property in the
   Properties sheet to 128,128,128 and the BorderWidth property to 2. Using
   the mouse or arrow keys, place this line directly under the bottom
   border line of the text box. Do not overlap the border line of the text
   box.

<P><LI>Repeat Step 7 for the second width line, placing it just outside of the
   right border line of the text box.

<P><LI>Select another text box and place it on the form. The SpecialEffect
   property should be set to 0 - 3D by default.
<P>
</OL>Run the form, and note that the first text box has a raised look while the
second textbox has a recessed look.
<P>
If a darker shadow is desired on the raised textbox, change the Border
Color property  of the bottom and right lines in the Properties sheet to
75,75,75.
