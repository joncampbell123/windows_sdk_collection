<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you are running a dBASE program under FoxPro, you may need to issue
the SET CONFIRM ON command before activating a popup in order to ensure
that the popup behaves in the same way under FoxPro and dBASE. After the
popup is exited, you may need to issue SET CONFIRM OFF because SET CONFIRM
ON will affect other aspects of program operation, such as GET objects and
menus.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When SET CONFIRM is OFF (the default value) and the cursor reaches the last
character in an @ ... GET input field, the cursor moves to the next field
and the bell sounds (if SET BELL is ON). If SET CONFIRM is ON, the ENTER or
TAB key must be pressed in order to move to the next object.
<P>
SET CONFIRM ON also affects menu bars and popups created with DEFINE MENU
and DEFINE POPUP. If SET CONFIRM is OFF, choosing an option from a popup or
a pad from a menu bar by pressing the key corresponding to the first letter
of the option is allowed. If SET CONFIRM is ON, typing the first letter of
the option or choosing a pad selects that option or pad. To choose the
option or pad, the ENTER or the SPACEBAR key must be pressed. If a popup
option or menu bar pad is defined with a hot key, the option or pad can be
chosen by pressing the corresponding hot key. SET CONFIRM has no effect on
hot keys.
