<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The ability to label both projects and individual files from within
SourceSafe gives the user a great deal of flexibility for source code
control. The label option can reduce redundancy within a database and in
some cases can help the user to better track projects.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Many organizations track version numbers and build numbers for programs.
Some users create a new project for each build or version while others
label individual files. Neither approach is wrong, but it can limit your
ability to fully tap the power of SourceSafe.
<P>
File labels are best used for tracking the progress of an individual file
independently from the version of the program that it is being used in. For
example, Microsoft Windows uses the CTRL3DV2.DLL file for 3-D enhancements
to various windows. The version of this file is important to many programs,
and therefore the version on this file is of high importance. This is how
file-level labels are best used. Tracking individual files (not necessarily
all files though) helps during development and testing.
<P>
Project-level labels are best used for tracking versions or builds of a
program. By placing a label on the parent project of certain programs, all
of the child projects and files inherently carry that label. Thus, one
label on the parent is the same as putting a label on each individual file
under that parent project. NOTE: Labels for the individual files within the
project do not change if the individual file label is changed. This saves a
lot of time for the user and reduces any errors from putting the wrong
version label on a file or skipping a file that should have been labeled.
<P>
By labeling the project, the user can reduce the number of projects that
must be used to track the life of a program. Normally if a development team
is working on version 5.0 of a program, there will be little use for
version 1.0 of the program. If a separate project is used for each version,
then the version 1.0 project will remain unless it is deleted (along with
the history), or just be left over in the system (taking up valuable disk
space).
<P>
If all of the parent projects have been labeled properly, then the
development team has the ability to GET a previous version of a program,
ROLLBACK all changes to the program, or SHARE-SEPARATE an old version of a
program for parallel development or bug fixes. No extra space is being
taken up by this, the number of excess projects is reduced, there is less
risk of passing the 8191 object limitation (no more than 8191 projects or
files under a single subproject), and there is a more concise form of
version/build level organization.
