Corrections to the README.TXT file
 
<P>
<P><h3>SourceSafe 3.1 Network installation instructions</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   SourceSafe stores it's contents in a database like area. All
   SourceSafe information shared by users will be in one location,
   specifically the DATA directory. When installing for multiple
   users, you would want to install SourceSafe in a location everyone
   has access to. Typically this location is a network server.

</PRE><h3>SourceSafe 3.1 Client installation instructions</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   Often users desire to have executables and other personal files on
   the local machine for speed purposes. This can be done with the
   following steps:

    - Copy executables and Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs) to the local
      directory.

    - Set the environment variable SSDIR to point to the network
      installation of SourceSafe. For example: SET SSDIR=G:\SS

   Some additional optional steps are:

    - Make a copy of the SS\TEMP directory on the local machine. Set
      the variable Temp_Path in the SS.INI. For example:

         Temp_Path = c:\ss\temp

    - Make a copy of the SS\USERS\&lt;user name&gt; subdirectory on the local
      machine. Set the variable for the desired user in the USERS.TXT
      file to point to the new location. For example:

         JOHN = c:\ss\users\john\ss.ini.

    For additional information on how to set up a local machine copy,
    please see the following articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

Corrections to the Online Windows Help File SSW.HLP
 
<P>
<P><h3>Disabling Keyword Expansion</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   Help says in "Keyword Expansion - The Format" that there is a
   special keyword $Nokeywords:$ that disables expansion for all
   keywords below it in the file that it is in. The format for the
   keyword is incorrect. It should be:

      $NoKeywords: $

   For additional information, please see the following article in
   the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../ssafe/q131092.htm">Q131092</A></B>
      TITLE     : PRB: Keyword Expansion Is Case Sensitive

</PRE><h3>Creating a Shadow Directory</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   Help says in "Creating a Shadow Directory", under step 2, "This
   simply means that you go to the directory, delete any files that are
   in it, and then Get all the files from the project."

   There is a knowledge base article which gives more information on
   how to do this step. For additional information, please see the
   following article(s) in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../ssafe/q131023.htm">Q131023</A></B>
      TITLE     : DOCERR: How to Set Up a Shadow Directory

</PRE><h3>The Configuration Variables</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   There are some additional SourceSafe INI Settings which are not
   listed in the "The Configuration Variables" help topic.

   For additional information, please see the following article(s) in
   the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../ssafe/q127189.htm">Q127189</A></B>
      TITLE     : DOCERR: Additional SourceSafe INI Settings

</PRE> 
Corrections to the Microsoft SourceSafe User Guide
 
<P>
<PRE>(Page 32)    Method 3: Command Line Parameters

   The command line examples are incorrect. They should be:

      SSW.EXE -yMARY

      or:

      SSW.EXE -yMARY,BIRTHMARK

(Page 67)    SourceSafe Keywords

   The last item in SourceSafe Keywords Table is:

      $Nokeywords: $     Disables expansion for all keywords below it
                         in the file.

   The format for the keyword is incorrect. It should be:

      $NoKeywords: $

   For additional information, please see the following article in
   the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../ssafe/q131092.htm">Q131092</A></B>
      TITLE     : PRB: Keyword Expansion Is Case Sensitive

(Page 67)    Columnar Formatting and Binary Files

   The second sentence of the second paragraph is incorrect. It
   currently says:

      This tells SourceSafe that the dollar sign after the keyword is
      exactly where you want it.

   It should be changed to say:

      This tells SourceSafe that the dollar sign after the keyword is
      exactly where you want the column to end.

(Page 74)    Creating a Shadow Directory

   Step 2 says "This simply means that you go to the directory, delete
   any files that are in it, and then Get all the files from the
   project."

   There is a knowledge base article which gives more information on
   how to do this step. For additional information, please see the
   following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../ssafe/q131023.htm">Q131023</A></B>
      TITLE     : DOCERR: How to Set Up a Shadow Directory

(Page 96)    APPENDIX B - Command Syntax

   The table which lists command options is incomplete.  For additional
   information, please see the following article(s) in the Microsoft
   Knowledge Base:

      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../ssafe/q127188.htm">Q127188</A></B>
      TITLE     : DOCERR: SourceSafe Undocumented Command Line Switches

</PRE>(Page 115) Using DELTA_SS.EXE Remarks
<P>
<PRE>   The last sentence of the first paragraph is incorrect.  It currently
   says:

      (The Delta project name must be specified with the -d option.)

   It should be changed to say:

      (The Delta project directory must be specified with the -d
      option.)

</PRE> 
Corrections to the Microsoft SourceSafe Reference
 
<P>
<P><h3>Additional SourceSafe INI Settings</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>    There are some additional SourceSafe INI Settings which are not
    described in chapter 2 of the Microsoft SourceSafe Reference.

    For additional information, please see the following article(s) in
    the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

       ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../ssafe/q127189.htm">Q127189</A></B>
