<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
SourceSafe may modify a file you checked out or put in your local working
directory. This is because SourceSafe is a multi-platform product. For text
files, the end-of-line character will vary depending on the platform that
you are using. One of the features of SourceSafe is that it converts these
characters for you as necessary.
<P>
However, if you need the file to remain as is, this feature can produce
unexpected results, errors, or problems.
<P>
The errors that may occur depend on the format of the file and the
application that is accessing the file. For example, an application may
produce a General Protection error in Windows, or not recognize the file
format as valid.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
SourceSafe detects binary files by looking for the ASCII value '0' (Null).
This null value is only present in a binary file. Some files may not have
this character, but need to be treated as binary regardless. For instance,
Rich Text Format (RTF) files perform better if treated as binary rather
than text files.
<P>
If a file format you are using seems to be corrupted by SourceSafe after
getting it to your working directory, check the file type. You can do this
in the interface by selecting Properties from the Info menu option. If the
File type is Text change it to Binary.
<P>
From the command line, execute:
<P>
<PRE>     ss filetype $/project/filename

</PRE>This will return the current file type. To change to binary, use the
command:
<P>
<PRE>     ss filetype $/project/filename -b

</PRE>An easy way to make sure all files with a certain extension are treated as
binary is to use the Binary_Masks setting in the SRCSAFE.INI or SS.INI. For
example:
<P>
<PRE>     Binary_Masks = *.rtf

</PRE>Make sure this setting is placed before any headers (enclosed in '[' ']'
characters). This will ensure that it applies to all projects.
