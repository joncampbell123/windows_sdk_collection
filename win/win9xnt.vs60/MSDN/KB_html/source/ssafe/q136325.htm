<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In Visual SourceSafe, files and projects can be dragged from one location
and dropped to another location. There are three operations that can be
performed with drag-and-drop: share, share and branch, and move.

<UL><LI>Share. The files and histories are under multiple projects, but there is
   physically only one copy of the files and histories in the SourceSafe
   database.

<LI>Share and branch. Copies of the files and histories are made. The
   branched files maintain links to the original files.

<LI>Move. The project is moved to a new location.
<P>
</UL>This article describes the mouse buttons, keystrokes, and menus that
control which type of drag-and-drop is used.
<P>
