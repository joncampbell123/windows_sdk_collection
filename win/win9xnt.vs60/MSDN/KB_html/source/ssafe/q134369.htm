This article covers some of the most Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
about Microsoft SourceSafe.

<PRE>1. Q. Where is SourceSafe putting my files?

   A. SourceSafe stores any files added to it in its DATA directory. The
   DATA directory is like a database, but only SourceSafe has access.

   To create a network share to access files outside of SourceSafe, the
   Shadow directory is used. The Shadow directory is a read-only
   location you can use to build from or access the latest files stored
   in SourceSafe.

   For additional information, please see the following article in the
   Microsoft Knowledge Base:

      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../ssafe/q124529.htm">Q124529</A></B>

2. Q. How do I install SourceSafe on a network?

   A. SourceSafe stores its contents like a database. All SourceSafe
   information shared by users will be in one location, the DATA
   directory. When the product is installed for multiple users,
   you want to install SourceSafe in a location where everyone has
   access. Typically, this location is a network server.

   Users often want to have executables and other personal files on
   the local machine for speed purposes. This can be done with the
   following steps:

   1. Copy executables and Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs) to the local
   directory.

   2. Set the environment variable SSDIR to point to the network
   installation of SourceSafe. For example: SET SSDIR=G:\SS.

   Some additional optional steps are:

   - Make a copy of the SS\TEMP directory on the local machine. Set the
   variable Temp_Path in the SS.INI. For example: Temp_Path = c:\ss\temp.

   - Make a copy of the SS\USERS\&lt;user name&gt; subdirectory on the local
   machine. Set the variable for the desired user in the Users.txt
   file to point to the new location. For example: JOHN =
   c:\ss\users\john\ss.ini.

3. Q. What is SSWCL.EXE?

   A. SSWCL.EXE is the command line product for the Windows platform. This
   executable allows you to execute SourceSafe commands from Windows.

   For example: the command SSWCL dir $/ -r displays the contents of the
   Root project ($/) recursively.

4. Q. What are sharing, branching, and merging?

   A. Sharing is a unique feature of SourceSafe that allows you to access
   the same file from multiple projects. This feature is very beneficial
   for users who have several different projects that share common
   components.

   All actions that take place on the file can be viewed from all
   projects the file is currently in. Therefore, a change made in one
   project will be reflected in all projects.

   Branching, takes a shared file and "separates" it or breaks the link
   with it and the other projects it currently is in. At this point,
   changes made to the file will not be reflected in the other file(s).
   This feature is often used when there is a need for specializing a
   common file, often for language differences or customizing an
   application.

   The Merge command allows you to merge any changes between separated
   files. This is often useful when a fix made to a branched file needs
   to be updated with the original project(s).
