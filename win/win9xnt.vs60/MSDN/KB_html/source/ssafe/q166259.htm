<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Visual Studio contains a number of source code control operations
on the Project/Source Control menu. These operations do not have any effect
on a Visual InterDev project.
<P>
In Visual C++, Visual J++, and other Visual Studio projects, source code
control is a client-side issue. Any source control operations are performed
on a source code database stored either on the client machine or on a
machine with a LAN connection to the client. To support projects that use
this type of connection, the Project\Source Control menu is used, and the
source code client lives on the client machine.
<P>
Unlike the cases above, however, it is possible that the Visual InterDev
project can be stored on the other side of a firewall, on some location
where a LAN connection cannot be made. This requires the source code
control database to likewise be behind the firewall, to ensure the security
of the project database. Visual InterDev uses FrontPage Server Extensions
to access the Web Server for this robustness, therefore Visual SourceSafe
and Visual InterDev integration is done via the FrontPage Server
Extensions.
<P>
This requires Visual InterDev to use a different model for source code
control than the other Visual Studio projects. As a result, the options on
the Project\Source control menu do not work against a Visual InterDev
project. To differentiate the client-side source control model of other
Visual Studio projects from the server-side source control of Visual
InterDev projects, different terminology is used for these operations.
These options are available by right-clicking any file in the Visual
InterDev project window.
<P>
In Visual InterDev, a "Get Working Copy" operation on a file retrieves the
file, and performs the server-side "check-out" action if the project is
under source control. "Release Working Copy" removes the file from the
local drive and checks in the file to the server. And "Discard Changes"
performs the equivalent of an undo checkout.
<P>
To use source code control in Visual InterDev, always use the Visual
InterDev server-side commands (accessed by right-clicking the files in the
project pane). The client-side commands available on the Project\Source
Control menu do not work with the server-side source control databases
required by Visual InterDev.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If you need to access any of the higher-level source control functionality
on the web server, then you need to access the source control server
directly, either on the server or on a machine connected to the server
through a LAN connection. When you are using Microsoft Visual SourceSafe,
for example, you can view the history information by running the Visual
SourceSafe client on the server machine. Likewise, the rolling back of
changes, Visual SourceSafe administration, and other source control tasks
can be performed in this way. However, note that if you use this approach,
you have to ensure that you move the changes you make directly to the
Visual SourceSafe database to the server directory that stores your web in
order to keep the Visual SourceSafe database and your web site in sync.

To setup up Visual SourceSafe on your web server, consult the Visual
InterDev user's guide for the chapter "Using Visual SourceSafe with your
web."
