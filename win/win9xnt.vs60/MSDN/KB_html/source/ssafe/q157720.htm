<P>
1.0  SOFTWARE INSTALLATION INFORMATION
<P>
The first step in installing Visual SourceSafe is the Server Setup: the
Visual SourceSafe administrator creates the SourceSafe database on a
network server that all users have access to, and adds all users to the
Visual SourceSafe user list. At this point, all users can begin running
Visual SourceSafe directly from the server: no further installation is
required.
<P>
However, each user may wish to take a second step and do a personal Network
Setup. This step improves performance and reduces network traffic, by
copying the Visual SourceSafe executables to the user's hard drive. More
important, this step registers Visual SourceSafe for direct integration
into host environments such as Microsoft Visual Basic (Enterprise and
Professional Editions, versions 4.0 and above), Microsoft Visual C++
(versions 4.0 and above), Microsoft Access (requires the Office Developer
Edition), Microsoft FrontPage (FrontPage '97 and above), Microsoft Visual
J++ (all versions), Microsoft Internet Studio (all versions), and Microsoft
Visual FoxPro (versions 5.0 and above). The Visual SourceSafe integration
into these environments will not work until the user has done a network or
client setup.
<P>
The Visual SourceSafe Setup program can also be used to upgrade an existing
Visual SourceSafe installation, or to perform maintenance (adding and
removing components) on an existing installation.
<P>
1.1 (Administrator) Creating a Visual SourceSafe Installation on a Server
<P>
The first step in creating a new Visual SourceSafe installation, or
upgrading an existing installation, is taken by the Visual SourceSafe
administrator. Run SETUP.EXE program on the Visual SourceSafe disk. SETUP
asks for the directory in which to install Visual SourceSafe. Choose a
directory on your network, such as R:\VSS, that is accessible to everyone
who will be using Visual SourceSafe. From the Setup options, choose the
Server Setup option.
<P>
If you are creating a new Visual SourceSafe installation, an empty Visual
SourceSafe database is created for you. Your next duty is to run the Visual
SourceSafe Administrator's program and add all your users to the Visual
SourceSafe user list. (The number of users that you can legally add to this
list is based on the number of Visual SourceSafe licenses you have
purchased.)
<P>
If you are upgrading an existing Visual SourceSafe installation, see
section 1.4 below.
<P>
After the successful completion of the Server Setup, your users are ready
to begin running Visual SourceSafe, or to use NETSETUP to create their
personal installations.
<P>
1.2 (Each User) Using NETSETUP to Create a Personal Installation
<P>
After an administrator has created a Visual SourceSafe installation on the
server, users can perform a network setup. This step copies the Visual
SourceSafe executables to your hard disk, pointing back to the central
database on the server. It also creates shortcuts in your Start Menu,
making it easier to run Visual SourceSafe. Most importantly, the network
setup registers Visual SourceSafe on your computer, enabling direct
integration of Visual SourceSafe menus into Integrated Development
Environments (IDEs) such as Microsoft Visual Basic (Enterprise and
Professional Editions, versions 4.0 and above), Microsoft Visual C++
(versions 4.0 and above), Microsoft Access (requires the Office Developer
Edition), Microsoft FrontPage (FrontPage '97 and above), Microsoft Visual
J++ (all versions), Microsoft Internet Studio (all versions), and Microsoft
Visual FoxPro (versions 5.0 and above).
<P>
To perform a network setup, you do not need the Visual SourceSafe disk.
Instead, go to the network location where the Visual SourceSafe server was
installed by your administrator and run NETSETUP.EXE. Specify a new
directory on your computer's hard disk, such as C:\VSS, as the location of
the Visual SourceSafe client.
<P>
After the successful completion of the Network Setup, you are ready to
begin running Visual SourceSafe.
<P>
An alternative to the network setup is the client setup. Run SETUP.EXE from
the Visual SourceSafe disk, and choose "Client Setup" option. At the end of
the Client setup, you will be prompted to enter the network location of
Visual SourceSafe server installation created by your administrator. The
end result of a Client Setup is exactly the same as the end result of a
Network Setup, including registration for integration: however, the process
is much slower, since it requires decompressing files from the disk. For
this reason, NETSETUP is generally preferable.
<P>
You might see a "File not found" error message during the NETSETUP
procedure if the Visual SourceSafe server setup was installed by using the
Custom setup option. For example, the administrator installing Visual
SourceSafe might have chosen not to install certain non-essential files,
such as the help system or the online version of the user's guide. In these
cases, you can ignore the message and continue with the NETSETUP. If any of
the essential files, such as the Visual SourceSafe executable program or
the database, are missing, contact your administrator.
<P>
1.3 Using the Custom Setup Option
<P>
When installing Visual SourceSafe to a server, you can choose the Custom
setup option. While not necessary for most users, this option is useful in
circumstances such as the following:

<UL><LI>You have limited disk space and want to save space by not installing
   certain options, such as the online books or the conversion utilities.

<LI>You want to have the "Server" and "Network" portions of Visual
   SourceSafe together in one installation. Custom Setup enables you to
   create the Visual SourceSafe database (as Server Setup does), register
   for IDE host integration (as network setup does), and copy the Visual
   SourceSafe executables (as both setups do), all in one step.
<P>
</UL>1.4 Upgrading a Previous SourceSafe Installation
<P>
If you have an older version of SourceSafe on your server, use the Visual
SourceSafe Server Setup to install Visual SourceSafe 5.0 directly on top of
the existing SourceSafe installation. Visual SourceSafe creates its new
directory structure, converts your database to the new format if necessary,
and installs the new executables so that you can run Visual SourceSafe 5.0
with all your existing users, projects, and files intact.
<P>
Notes about upgrading:

<OL><P><LI>Back up your SourceSafe database before upgrading. The installation
   process converts your existing database into a new format: if there are
   problems during this process, there is no way to return to your previous
   database without a backup.

<P><LI>Make sure all users exit SourceSafe before installing a new version.

<P><LI>If users have copies of the SourceSafe executables on their computer's
   hard disks, they need to use the Network Setup to copy the new
   SourceSafe over the old, after the server setup is completed.
<P>
</OL>1.5 The Installation Maintenance Program
<P>
When SETUP detects that you already have an installation of the most recent
version of Visual SourceSafe, it goes into "maintenance mode." This mode is
designed to allow you to add or remove components, or to uninstall Visual
SourceSafe.
<P>
The maintenance program provides following choices when you run SETUP in a
server environment:

<UL><LI>Add/Remove. Click this choice to add or remove options from a list such
   as a Visual SourceSafe database, executable files, IDE registration,
   Help files and the online version of the User's Guide, conversion
   utilities, and the network client setup.

<LI>Reinstall. Click this choice to repeat the last installation of Visual
   SourceSafe and restore missing files and settings.

<LI>Remove All. Click this choice to remove all previously installed
   components.
<P>
</UL>When you run SETUP in a Visual SourceSafe client environment, your options
are Reinstall and Remove All.
<P>
1.6 Uninstalling Visual SourceSafe
<P>
To uninstall Visual SourceSafe (remove existing components or the Visual
SourceSafe program and database itself), run the SETUP program from the
SETUP directory, which is under the directory in which you installed the
Visual SourceSafe server. This action displays the installation maintenance
program. To remove the entire Visual SourceSafe program, click Remove All.
Then follow the directions on the screen.
<P>
For the uninstall procedure to complete successfully, run the SETUP program
on the same platform you used to install Visual SourceSafe. For example,
run the SETUP program on Windows 95 to uninstall Visual SourceSafe if you
installed Visual SourceSafe on a Windows 95 system; run the SETUP program
on Windows NT if you installed Visual SourceSafe on a Windows NT system.
<P>
When you run the uninstall procedure, certain critical files are maintained
to protect against accidental deletion. The \DATA directory is preserved,
and if users have been added to the installation, the \USERS directories
for users and files created by the SSADMIN program are also preserved. In
addition, the SETUP directory, the SRCSAFE.INI file, the USERS.TXT file,
and MSCREATE.DIR are preserved. All other files are deleted. If you run the
uninstall procedure and find that you need to reinstall Visual SourceSafe,
reinstall back to the same location. Only customizations to the SS.INI
files for the guest and admin users are lost.
<P>
When you want to completely uninstall Visual SourceSafe, run the uninstall
procedure. Then, from the command shell, use the DELTREE command to delete
the directory in which you installed Visual SourceSafe and all the folders
remaining under it.
<P>
1.7 WININET and MFC DLLs
<P>
Visual SourceSafe installs certain shared DLLs, such as MFC and WININET.
When you install Visual SourceSafe, it may detect that you already have
these files, and offer to overwrite them.
<P>
In most cases, the correct answer is no. Visual SourceSafe may be
attempting to install files that are older than the ones you have. Or,
Visual SourceSafe may be installing the U.S. English version of the files,
when you have the version that is properly localized for your country. If
you overwrite your existing files with the Visual SourceSafe files, your
existing applications may not work properly, or may start displaying in
U.S. English.
<P>
The only circumstance under which you should overwrite is if your copies of
these files is out of date. Visual SourceSafe 5.0 ships with a copy of
WININET.DLL that shipped with Internet Explorer 3.0, and with MFC DLLs from
Visual C++ version 4. If your files are older than these versions, you must
allow Visual SourceSafe to install updated copies.
<P>
1.8  SourceSafe on RISC
<P>
The Visual SourceSafe CD ships with versions for four different Windows NT
platforms: Intel, Alpha, MIPS, and Power PC. SETUP does not install all
four, however: SourceSafe is only installed for the machine that you are
running SETUP on.
<P>
Suppose, as an example, that you have some users on Intel and some on the
Power PC platform. What you must do, as an administrator, is run SETUP from
an Intel machine, and then run it again from a Power PC, choosing "Server
Setup" both times. (SourceSafe will note the second time that you are
installing over an existing version: do not worry, you will not lose any
data!)  Only after both installations will your users be able to run
SourceSafe, NETSETUP, to their client machines on both platforms.
