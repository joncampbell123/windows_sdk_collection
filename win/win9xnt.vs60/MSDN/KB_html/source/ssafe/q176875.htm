<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Earlier versions of the Visual SourceSafe did not provide a method for
archiving parts of Visual SourceSafe databases. The only way to free up
space was to destroy a file or project. Furthermore, there was no way to
move information between databases. The archive utilities Ssarc.exe and
Ssrestor.exe are separate command-line utilities that allow you to do the
following:

<OL><P><LI>Archive a file or project out of the database into a special compressed
   file, then restore it later with its history, Share Links, and other
   information intact.

<P><LI>Archive specific versions of a file (for example, all versions prior to
   3.1), thus freeing up the space they use in the database, and then
   restore them to the database later.

<P><LI>Archive a file, project or project tree from one database and restore it
   into a different database.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The archive utilities Ssarc.exe and Ssrestor.exe are separate command-line
utilities that allow you to do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Archive a file or project out of the database into a special compressed
   file, then restore it later with its history, Share Links, and other
   information intact.
<P>
   A syntax example of this is:
<P>
<P><PRE>      C:\&gt;"C:\Program Files\DevStudio\Vss\Win32\SSARC" -d- -i- -sD:\VSSTest
      Archive.ssa $/
</PRE><P>
   The quotes are only necessary if a space exists in the command line. The
   -d- option is an instruction not to delete the files being archived from
   the original database. The -i- option is an instruction for no input
   (accept all defaults). The -s switch specifies a path to the Srcsafe.ini
   and the data directory.

<P><LI>Archive specific versions of a file (for example, all versions prior to
   5), thus freeing up the space they use in the database, and then restore
   them to the database later.
<P>
   For example, if the files in the project are at least version 20 and you
   want to archive old versions that are no longer needed, the
   you could use the following syntax to accomplish this:
<P>
<P><PRE>      C:\&gt;"C:\Program Files\Devstudio\Vss\Win32\SSARC" -v10 -sD:\VSSTest
      Archive.ssa $/Queries/Test
</PRE><P>
   Because the -d- and -i- options where not specified, the user will be
   prompted to answer the questions:
<P>
   Delete archived information from database?(Y/N)
   File C:\archive.ssa already exists. Overwrite?(Y/N)
<P>
   Note that, in general, the archive utility is inclusive. That is, in the
   above example, the created archive (Archive.ssa) contains version 10 and
   everything before it. If you are using a label, and the label has a
   space in it, you must add an end quote to the entire option (for
   example, "-vThis One").

<P><LI>Archive a file, project or project tree from one database and restore it
   into a different database. You could use the following syntax to restore
   the Archive.ssa (from example one above) from the VSSTest database to
   another database called VSSTest2:
<P>
<P><PRE>     C:\&gt;"C:\Program Files\Devstudio\Vss\Win32\SSRESTOR" -sD:\VSSTest2
     Archive.ssa $/Queries/Test
</PRE><P>
