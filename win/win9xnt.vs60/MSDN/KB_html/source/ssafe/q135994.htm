<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Visual Basic, when you check out a form by using the SourceSafe Add-In,
you automatically check out both the .frm and .frx file for that form.
<P>
However, in the Visual SourceSafe Explorer, you can check out the .frm file
without the .frx file and vice versa. If the .frx file is checked out
without the .frm, the Visual Basic form is considered to be not checked out
(read only). If the .frm file is checked out without the .frx file, the
Visual Basic form is considered to be checked out, so modifications can be
made to that form. This can cause problems when trying to save the form if
you make graphical changes to the form. The following error is displayed:
<P>
<PRE>   Path/File access error: '&lt;path to .frx file&gt;'

</PRE>None of the changes are saved to either the .frm or the .frx file. However,
the changes are still available in Visual Basic.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Changes were not saved to either the .frm or the .frx file because the .frx
file is read-only. The .frx file is read-only because the file was never
checked out.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To save the changes, switch to the Visual SourceSafe Explorer and check out
the .frx file. Then switch to Visual Basic and save the project once again.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
It is always important to keep the Visual Basic .frx and .frm files in
sync with each other in every way.
<P>
<P><h3>Functions that Keep the .frm and .frx Files in Sync Automatically</h3>
 
<P>
The following functions automatically keep the .frm and .frx files in sync:
<P>
<PRE>    "Add File" from inside Visual Basic
    "Delete File" from inside Visual Basic
    "Get" from inside Visual Basic
    "Check Out" from inside Visual Basic
    "Check In" from inside Visual Basic
    "Undo Check Out" from inside Visual Basic
    "Save As" from inside Visual Basic

</PRE><h3>Situations Where You Need to Keep the .frm and .frx Files in Sync Manually</h3>
 
<P>
The following operations don't keep the .frm and .frx files in sync unless
you do it manually:
<P>
<PRE>  Any SourceSafe Explorer command
  Any SourceSafe command line command

</PRE>This includes (but is not limited to) Add, Delete, Get, Check Out, Check
In, Undo Check out, and Share. In all these cases, you need to ensure that
the action is taken on both the .frm and .frx file.
<P>
Any actions inside the History dialog box (for example, Get, Pin, and
Rollback) must be taken from inside Visual Basic. However, the .frx still
does not tag along. Therefore, Microsoft recommends that you take these
actions only for .bas and .cls files, or for .frm files that do not have an
.frx file. For a .frm and .frx file pair, use the SourceSafe Explorer or
command line to operate on both files (one at a time, in the Explorer).
<P>
A Share action, even if taken from Visual Basic, doesn't include the .frx
file automatically. However, in this case, you don't need to start
SourceSafe; just make sure to choose both the .frm and .frx files in the
Share dialog box inside Visual Basic.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>In Visual Basic, open the Controls sample project, and place it under
   SourceSafe control.

<P><LI>In the Visual SourceSafe Explorer, check out the Button.frm file but not
   the .frx file.

<P><LI>In Visual Basic, on the Add-Ins menu, click SourceSafe, and then click
   Refresh File Status to get in sync with the Visual SourceSafe Explorer.

<P><LI>In Visual Basic, open the Button form, and click the traffic light
   picture box. Change the Picture property to some other bitmap picture.

<P><LI>In Visual Basic, save the project. At this point, you'll see this error
   message:
<P>
   Path/File access error: '&lt;path to .frx file&gt;'
<P></OL>
