</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Loss of Network Connection Produces Numerical Error Message</h3>
 
<P>
If you are in the middle of a Visual SourceSafe session and lose your
connection to a server over the network, the only message you see is a
numerical message informing you of an unknown error. When you see, "unknown
error - 20038," or something similar, you have lost your network
connection. Restart Visual SourceSafe and continue your work.
<P>
<P><h3>File List Not Always Automatically Updated for Certain Actions After Search</h3>
 
<P>
The file list displayed in the Visual SourceSafe Explorer is not always
updated for certain actions after completion of a global or recursive
wildcard or status search. In these cases, use the Refresh File List
command on the View menu to update the display.
<P>
Example 1: A global or recursive search has completed and the results view
displays the results of that search. You share a file from the results view
with Project1. Project1 contained no files meeting the search criteria
before the share action. After the share action, Project1 has a child,
Project2, that now meets the search criteria. The file list display does
not show the contents of Project2 until you use the Refresh File List
command. If Project1 is already in the results view, the shared file shows
up in the display.
<P>
Adding a file or a project after a search produces a similar situation. If
a parent did not appear in the results view before the share or the add,
the shared or added file does not appear in the results view. If the parent
was there, the new added or shared file does appear in the display.
<P>
Example 2: Three projects are displayed in the results view after a search.
Two projects share a file. If you check out the file from one of the
projects, you need to use the Refresh File List command to see the "checked
out" icon on all instances of the shared file in the file list.
<P>
<P><h3>Considerations for 16-Bit Systems</h3>
 
<P>
When you run Visual SourceSafe in Windows 3.1 16-bit systems, you are
limited to one instance of Visual SourceSafe Explorer or Visual SourceSafe
Administrator at a time.
<P>
In addition, you can run only one instance of Visual SourceSafe-Visual
Basic integration at a time. If you need to run more than one instance of
Visual SourceSafe-Visual Basic integration to debug a program for example,
you can use the following procedure:

<OL><P><LI>From the Visual Basic Tools menu, check out the files you want to
   change.

<P><LI>On the Add-Ins menu, click Add-In Manager to display the Add-In Manager
   dialog box.

<P><LI>Clear the Source Code Control Add-In check box.

<P><LI>Debug your program.

<P><LI>On the Add-Ins menu, click Add-In Manager to display the Add-In Manager
   dialog box.

<P><LI>Click the Source Code Control Add-In check box.

<P><LI>Check in your changed files.
<P>
</OL><h3>Considerations for NEC PC 9801 Systems</h3>
 
<P>
The memory manager used by Visual SourceSafe MS-DOS programs is not
compatible with the NEC PC 9801 computer. Visual SourceSafe programs for
Windows 3.1, Windows NT, and Windows 95 are fully compatible with the NEC
PC 9801 computer.
<P>
If you use an NEC PC 9801 computer, do not run any programs from the
command line in the Visual SourceSafe \Dos directory, which is under the
directory in which you installed Visual SourceSafe. These programs include
the following programs and utilities: Analyze.exe, Ddconv.exe,
Delta_Ss.exe, Mkss.exe, Pvcs_Ss.exe, Ssint.exe, Sslogin.exe, Testlock.exe,
and Unlock.exe. If you run these programs from the \Dos directory, you
might have to reboot your computer.
<P>
To use these programs, run them from the \Win or \Win32 directories under
the directory in which you installed Visual SourceSafe. This restriction
applies only to the NEC PC 9801 computer.
<P>
<P><h3>Considerations when Cancelling a Client Setup</h3>
 
<P>
When you choose the Client Setup option to install Visual SourceSafe, you
must type a path for the Visual SourceSafe server directory. If you click
Cancel in the Database Location dialog box, Setup displays the following
message in error, "Microsoft Visual SourceSafe 4.0 Setup was completed
successfully." Disregard this message. The setup was not completed.
Although a directory tree was created on your hard disk for the client, you
cannot connect with the database on the server.
<P>
To correct this situation, edit the Srcsafe.ini file created by the
cancelled Client setup. Add a line including the path to the Srcsafe.ini
file for the Visual SourceSafe database server in a #include statement. You
can include a UNC path, for example:
<P>
<PRE>   #include \\SRCSERVR\SRCSHARE\VSS4\SRCSAFE.INI

</PRE></OL>Alternatively, you can include the path to a mapped drive, for example:
<P>
<PRE>   #include R:\VSS\SRCSAFE.INI

</PRE><h3>Considerations when Installing on Alpha and Mips Systems</h3>
 
<P>
When you install Visual SourceSafe 4.0 on an Alpha or Mips system, you
might see two messages informing you that certain files can't be opened.
These files are Mfc30.dll and Msvcrt20.dll, which are installed in the
\Windows\System directory. If you have already installed these files during
another the installation of another product and the files are already open,
click Ignore in the message boxes and continue with your installation of
Visual SourceSafe 4.0.
<P>
<P><h3>Considerations When Choosing SourceSafe Database from IDEs</h3>
 
<P>
When you have multiple SourceSafe databases, the Advanced options for
Source Control from within an IDE allows you to choose to be prompted for a
database name to connect to. In your Srcsafe.ini file, you must explicitly
name a data path, by using the Data_Path initialization variable, for each
of the multiple databases. The Choose SourceSafe Database dialog box
prompts you for a name, and uses that name to connect to the database you
want.
<P>
If you have not explicitly supplied a data path in your Srcsafe.ini file
for each database, the IDE might not find the database you want and you
will be connected to the default database. To connect to one of multiple
databases, you must provide a separate Data_Path value with an explicit
path and a named value for each database you want to connect to. By
including a named value within parentheses, such as Data_Path(scc), you can
then use the value in parentheses when prompted for a data path.
<P>
<P><h3>Considerations When Acting on .Frm Files from Within Visual SourceSafe</h3>
 
<P>
When you perform an action on a Visual Basic .frm file from within Visual
SourceSafe, the .frx file associated with the .frm file is not affected by
the action you perform. For example, if you check out an .frm form, the
associated .frx file is not checked out. To keep the associated files
synchronized, perform all actions from within the Visual Basic environment,
not from standalone Visual SourceSafe. Alternatively, you can perform the
actions from within standalone Visual SourceSafe, but you must perform the
same action on the.frx file that you perform on the .frm file.
<P>
<P><h3>Considerations When Installing on Netware 4.02 and Banyan 5.52 Systems</h3>
 
<P>
When you install Visual SourceSafe on Netware 4.02 and Banyan 5.52 systems,
the Setup program generates a message telling you to use the following
command: SETUP /F. When you use that command, Setup generates error code
997, indicating that your setup files may have been damaged. Disregard that
message. The setup files have not been damaged.
<P>
To install Visual SourceSafe on these systems, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Use Setup to install the Visual SourceSafe server option on the hard
   disk of your local computer in a directory such as C:\Vss.

<P><LI>Use XCOPY to copy the directory in which you installed Visual SourceSafe
   and all of its subdirectories to your server.
<P>
</OL>After copying all Visual SourceSafe directories and files to a Netware 4.02
or Banyan 5.52 system, you can perform all Visual SourceSafe actions,
including Netsetup for client installations. However, removing Visual
SourceSafe by using the Setup program might not work. To remove all Visual
Source files and directories, use the MS-DOS command DELTREE to delete the
directory in which you installed Visual SourceSafe and all its
subdirectories and files.
