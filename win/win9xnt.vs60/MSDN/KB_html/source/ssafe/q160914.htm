The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 16-bit and 32-bit, for Windows,
   versions 4.0, 4.0a
<LI>Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 32-bit, for Windows, version 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When running the Analyze utility against a SourceSafe database, the
following message appears:
<P>
<PRE>   The data file for &lt;real file name &gt; (&lt;physical file name&gt;) was
   not found

</PRE>For example:
<P>
<PRE>   The data file for "myfile.txt" (qusaaaaa.b) was not found.

</PRE>This article discusses some of the steps that can be taken to resolve the
problem.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Files under SourceSafe control are stored as a file pair: the data file and
the log file. In this example, Analyze has found that a log file exists
with no matching data file: there is a file qusaaaaa in the DATA\Q
directory, but no matching qusaaaaa.b file.
<P>
NOTE: This article will use the file names in the example error message
given above.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Your first step should always be to back up the entire DATA directory.
You should also make sure you are using the most recent version of
Analyze.exe. Please see the REFERENCES section of this article for more
information.
<P>
There are three ways to resolve this error:

<OL><P><LI>Delete qusaaaaa from the DATA/Q subdirectory.

<P><LI>Add a valid copy of qusaaaaa.b to the DATA/Q subdirectory.

<P><LI>Delete myfile.txt from the SourceSafe database, and then add it back.
<P>
</OL>In many cases, there is a single copy of myfile.txt in the database that
has been deleted and removed permanently. If you are confident that this
is the case, deleting qusaaaaa will resolve the problem. If you are not
sure, see the MORE INFORMATION section below for guidelines on what
course of action to take.
<P>
Adding a valid copy of qusaaaaa.b can be done in two ways:

<OL><P><LI>This is the better method. If a user has a local copy of myfile.txt that
   is identical to the last checked-in version, copy myfile.txt into the
   DATA\Q directory, and then rename the copy to qusaaaaa.b. It is
   important not to leave a file named myfile.txt in the data directory.
   You can see who last checked the file in by viewing its History. If that
   user has a local copy that has not been modified since the check in,
   this method will work.
<P>
   It is also possible that a user may have performed a "Get Latest
   Version" of myfile.txt (though there is no way of testing to see if this
   has happened) and has a local copy of the correct version of the file.
   If so, this method will also work, but you must remove the read-only
   flag of qusaaaaa.b after renaming it.
<P>
   This method assumes that the SourceSafe user or administrator knows
   whether the local version has been modified since the last Check Out
   or Get.

<P><LI>If you have a backup of the database, copy the backup version of the
   file pair into the DATA\Q subdirectory: qusaaaaa (the log file) and the
   corresponding data file that will have either a .a or .b extension. In
   this case, any changes made since the backup will be lost.
<P>
   If you do not have a backup or a correct version of the file, the only
   resolution is to delete myfile.txt from SourceSafe and add it back in.
   In this case, you will lose all history and branching information.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
With Novell version 3.12 or later, on a Windows 95 machine using the
Microsoft client for NetWare Networks (found under Control Panel ..
Network .. Configuration), deleting a file from the SourceSafe database
will delete only the data file, causing this error.
<P>
The above configuration is known to cause a problem. It has been seen in
other configurations, though not consistently reproduced. For the purpose
of this article, the configuration is not important because it is
suggesting ways of resolving the error, regardless of the cause.
<P>
The following section provides some guidelines to help you determine
whether you can delete the data file, or whether you need to add it back
to the database:

<OL><P><LI>Is there a single copy of myfile.txt, or multiple copies?

<P><LI>What project or projects contain myfile.txt?

<P><LI>If there are multiple copies, are they different files in different
   projects that happen to have the same name, or are they linked (has
   myfile.txt been shared or branched)?

<P><LI>Has every occurrence of myfile.txt been deleted from the database? If
   so, was it purged or destroyed?
<P>
</OL>Often, a user or the SourceSafe administrator will be able to answer these
questions and the following steps will be unnecessary. The methods
described here and the order in which they occur will vary from one case to
another.
<P>
You can answer the questions above using a combination of the following
methods:

<OL><P><LI>Issuing this command at the SourceSafe command line interface:
<P>
<P><PRE>      SS Locate myfile.txt
</PRE><P>
   will find all occurrences of myfile.txt that have not been deleted,
   and those that have been deleted but not removed permanently. If
   multiple copies of myfile.txt are found, use the SourceSafe Physical
   command to identify which project contains which instance of myfile.txt.

<P><LI>A recursive History of the top level project will tell what files have
   been added, deleted, destroyed, purged, or branched.

<P><LI>If a file has been shared, viewing the Links for that file will show
   which projects share the file.

<P><LI>If a file has been branched, viewing the Paths for that file will show
   which projects contain branches of the file.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: It is preferable to view Links and Paths from the command line
interface because viewing from the SourceSafe Explorer will return errors.
These errors can be ignored, but may be confusing.
<P>
The log file, qusaaaaa, can be deleted only if all instances of myfile.txt
that have a link or path to the copy that is causing the error have been
removed permanently from the database.
<P>
If this is not the case, locate a copy of myfile.txt that is identical to
the last checked-in version. If no suitable copy exists, restore the file
pair from a backup. Deleting and adding myfile.txt back should only be used
in a "worst case" situation in which neither of the previous two methods is
possible.
