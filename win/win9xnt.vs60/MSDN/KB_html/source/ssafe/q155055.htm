The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 16-bit and 32-bit, for Windows,
   versions 4.0, 5.0
<LI>Enterprise Edition of Microsoft Visual Basic, 16-bit and 32-bit,
   for Windows version, 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Visual Basic Forms and other files can be located anywhere on any machine.
The .VBP file contains pointers to these files wherever they may be
located. Visual SourceSafe needs to have the project files somewhere in the
working directory structure in order to make the mapping association with
the project. If this mapping association is not followed, the glyphs that
represent file status may be incorrect.
<P>
For example, a file's glyph in the SourceSafe Explorer may indicate that
the file is under source code control and not checked out (for instance,
the file is read-only) while the Visual Basic glyph may say that the file
is writable. This behavior occurs because the .VBP file is looking at one
file and Visual SourceSafe is looking at a different copy of the same file.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Form on the different drive is a read/write file. The form in the
working directory is a read-only file. Visual Basic is still looking at the
file on the different drive while Visual SourceSafe is looking at the file
in the working directory.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Save the project (File, Save Project), and then refresh the project (Add-
Ins, SourceSafe, Refresh File Status). These two steps update the .VBP file
so it is looking at the file written for that project in the SourceSafe
Working Directory. The original file still exists in the location where it
was originally saved, but the Visual Basic project no longer points to it.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start Visual Basic 4.0. Form1 is created by default.

<P><LI>Start up the Source Code Control Options (Add-Ins, SourceSafe, Options).
   Set "Add files to source control when adding them to Visual Basic"
   to NO.

<P><LI>Open a Visual Basic project that is under source code control. Check the
   files out. Add a new form to the Visual Basic project and save this new
   form to a different drive.

<P><LI>Run the following SourceSafe command:
<P>
   "Add-Ins, SourceSafe, Add files to SourceSafe..."
<P>
   and select the newly-saved form.
<P>
   The following informational message will be displayed:
<P>
   File &lt;path on different drive&gt;\&lt;newform&gt;.frm could not be mapped to
   the SourceSafe project $/&lt;SourceSafe Project&gt;. Copy the file to
   &lt;working directory path&gt;?

<P><LI>Answer YES to the message. The following message is then displayed:
<P>
   "Please save and check-in your Visual Basic project file. Otherwise
   your project will contain references to the remapped files in their
   old locations instead of their current locations."
<P>
   Note that the glyph for the form shows that the form is under source
   code control but its checkin/checkout status is not defined.

<P><LI>Save the project. Check in the project file. At this point, the glyphs
   display as they should.
<P>
</OL>The original copy of the form is still located on the different drive. In
addition, the new copy of the form is located in the project working
directory. Only the new copy of the form is pointed to by the .VBP and
updated with Visual SourceSafe. The old copy will need to be deleted
manually.
