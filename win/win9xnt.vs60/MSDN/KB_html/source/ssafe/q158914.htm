The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FrontPage version 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you try to open a FrontPage web that is under the control of Visual
SourceSafe, you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Server Error: "Web Root is busy. Please try again."

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The most likely cause of this error message is that you have used
SourceSafe itself to set up and populate the files in the Web project.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
In order to achieve the most thorough integration, use FrontPage to check
out, check in, and create files for the SourceSafe project.
<P>
To do this, use the appropriate method for your situation:
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1</h3>
 
<P>
If you have already placed the Web under source control and populated the
project with files using SourceSafe Explorer, use the following steps:
<P>
a. Check out every file in your Web project to a local directory. This
<PRE>   provides you with a backup copy.

</PRE>b. Delete the SourceSafe project.
<P>
<PRE>   Note that this does not delete the files in place on the Web server. You
   also have the checked out local copies as a backup.

</PRE>c. Recursively remove the read-only bit on all the Web files. To do this,
<PRE>   at the MS-DOS command prompt, type "cd" (without the quotation marks) to
   position the working directory at the Web content area, and the type the
   following:

      attrib *.* -R /s

</PRE>d. In FrontPage Explorer, open the Web.
<P>
e. On the Tools menu, click Web Settings. In the Source Control Project
<PRE>   box, type "$/" and the name of the project you want the files managed
   under.

   For example, if the project you want to create is named "web," type
   "$/web" (without the quotation marks) in the Source Control Project box.
   (It is not necessary for the Source Control Project name to have any
   relationship to the name of the Web.)

</PRE>f. In the Web Settings dialog box, click OK or Apply.
<P>
<PRE>   FrontPage will populate your Web project with the necessary files.

</PRE>g. Use FrontPage to check out, edit, and check in the files.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 2</h3>
 
<P>
If you have not already placed the Web files under source control, use the
following steps:.
<P>
a. On the Tools menu, click Web Settings. In the Source Control Project
<PRE>   box, type "$/" and the name of the project you want the files managed
   under.

   For example, if the project you want to create is named "web," type
   "$/web" (without the quotation marks) in the Source Control Project box.
   (It is not necessary for the Source Control Project name to have any
   relationship to the name of the Web.)

</PRE>b. In the Web Settings dialog box, click OK or Apply.
<P>
<PRE>   FrontPage will populate your Web project with the necessary files.

</PRE>c. Use FrontPage to check out, edit, and check in the files.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
FrontPage is designed to act as the front-end for your SourceSafe project.
Use FrontPage itself to place the Web files under source control.
