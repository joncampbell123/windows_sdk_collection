The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, versions 4.0, 5.0
<LI>Microsoft SourceSafe for Windows, version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft SourceSafe for Windows NT, version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft SourceSafe for MS-DOS, version 3.1

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft does not recommend that you set up multiple SourceSafe databases.
However, sometimes you may find that multiple SourceSafe databases are
needed.
<P>
NOTE: You cannot share files between multiple databases. You cannot move
files between databases and still retain the history and differences. And
you cannot merge separate databases.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The printed documentation outlines three ways to implement multiple
SourceSafe databases:

<UL><LI>Use multiple installations of SourceSafe. This is the simplest method.
   But the replication of the SourceSafe executables, and the multiple
   Ss.ini files for each user will be difficult to maintain.

<LI>Use multiple Srcsafe.ini files. This is easier to maintain because fewer
   files are replicated. It uses the environment variable SSDIR to find the
   file Srcsafe.ini. Then looks for the "Data_Path" variable in that file
   to find out the DATA directory that contains your files and projects.
   This method requires that the MS-DOS SET command be executed before you
   enter Visual SourceSafe.

<LI>Use multiple Data_Path settings. This method completely avoids redundant
   files. It uses a SourceSafe feature that allows user added platform
   specifiers. In MS-DOS, use the SET command as in this example:
  
<P><PRE>      SET SSINIENV = BOB
</PRE>  
   Then, in the srcsafe.ini file include something like this:
  
<P><PRE>      Data_Path (BOB) = X:\SS\DATA
</PRE><P>
   X: is the mapping of the drive from the network, and SS\DATA is the
  location of the data.
  
   IMPORTANT NOTE: This environment variable is set in MS-DOS, so Windows
   will accept it, but cannot change it. Therefore, it is possible to have
   multiple MS-DOS sessions open with different SourceSafe databases, but
   you can't do the same thing in the Windows platform. To accomplish this,
   open an MS-DOS box, and change the SET SSINIENV appropriately. Then
   start the MS-DOS version of SourceSafe in the MS-DOS box. You can do
   this as many times as your system will support. An alternative for
   Windows users is to have multiple icons with different command lines
   that indicate the platform specifiers. An example of such a command
   line is:
<P>
<P><PRE>      X:\VSS\SSEXP.EXE /DBOB
</PRE><P>
</UL>NOTE: The name of the current database is displayed in the Visual
SourceSafe Explorer title bar. The database name can be assigned through
the Visual SourceSafe Administrator [Tools][Options] General dialog box.
<P>
NOTE: The information in this article applies to Visual SourceSafe 5.0 but
is not necessary with the new "Open Database" feature. For more information
about setting up multiple databases in Visual SourceSafe 5.0, please see
