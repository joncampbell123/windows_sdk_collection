The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 16-bit and 32-bit, for Windows,
   versions 4.0, 4.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When a file is checked out, it loses one byte. This can be seen by doing a
File Difference. It can also been seen by looking at the byte count of the
file in the Working Directory and comparing this to the Size displayed in
the Properties of the file in Visual SourceSafe. This will sometimes cause
the file to function incorrectly in its native application.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Upon checking out a binary file, Visual SourceSafe removes the last
character if that character is EOF (Decimal 26; Hex 1AH) and the SetTime
INI variable is set to anything other than Current.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 

<UL><LI>Use the WIN32\SSEXP.EXE or WIN32\SS.EXE.
<P>
   - or -

<LI>Change the SetTime INI variable to "Current." This can be adjusted by
   changing the value of "Set date/time on local files:" located in the
   Tools menu, Options option, on the Local Files Tab.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed
at the beginning of this article. We are researching this bug and will post
new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior seems to occur when six factors are true:

<OL><P><LI>The user is running the DOS or WIN executables, either SS or SSEXP.

<P><LI>The file type in Visual SourceSafe is binary.

<P><LI>The last byte of the file is Hex EOF.

<P><LI>The SetTime INI setting is either Modification or Check In.

<P><LI>SourceSafe is running in a 16-bit operating environment.

<P><LI>Checking out the file causes SourceSafe to actually write its stored
   copy of the file to the user's hard drive. For example, if the local
   copy has been deleted or if the file is checked out to a directory that
   doesn't contain a copy of the file.
