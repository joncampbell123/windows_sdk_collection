The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 16-bit and 32-bit, for Windows 95,
   versions 4.0, 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When a file is deleted in Visual SourceSafe, the file is still held in the
SourceSafe database; it is simply marked for deletion. The files marked for
deletion are still taking up space on the disk and are still available to
be recovered.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
There are several ways to recover disk space in Visual SourceSafe:

<UL><LI>Select the Destroy Permanently check box when deleting a file to
   completely remove it from the database.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Use the Visual SourceSafe Purge command from the Command window or from
   within Visual SourceSafe Explorer.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Use Analyze.exe with the -c and -d switches. Do not use these switches
   together. Run analyze twice, once with each switch . However, use this
   with extreme caution. Note that this applies to versions of Analyze.exe
   dated 1/9/96 or later. If you have an earlier version, please see the
   following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base for further
   information:

<PRE>   TITLE     : SAMPLE: ANALYZE5.EXE Utility for Visual SourceSafe

</PRE></UL><h3>Step-by-Step Example</h3>
 
<P>
Delete with the Destroy Permanently option:

<OL><P><LI>In SourceSafe Explorer, select the desired file or project, and press
   the DELETE key.

<P><LI>Select the Destroy Permanently check box, and click OK. The file or
   project is no longer recoverable.
<P>
</OL>Purge option:

<OL><P><LI>In SourceSafe Explorer, right-click the Project, and select the
   Properties option.

<P><LI>Select the Deleted Items tab. If any files are deleted in that project,
   the Purge button will be available.
<P>
</OL>Analyze -C option:

<OL><P><LI>First and foremost, back up the database. At the command line, change to
   the \win32 directory where ANALYZE.EXE resides.

<P><LI>Type Analyze &lt;path to data directory&gt; -C at the command line and allow
   some time for this to run.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: You may also want to run analyze with the -d  switch as suggested in
the Knowledge Base Article <B><A href="../ssafe/q139566.htm">Q139566</A></B>: ANALYZE5.EXE Utility for Visual
SourceSafe 4.0, referenced above.
<P>
NOTE: Be sure that there is plenty of free hard disk space, back up, and
allow a lot of time with this method.
