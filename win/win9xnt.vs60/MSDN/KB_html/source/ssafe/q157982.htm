<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes staged development in Visual SourceSafe.
<P>
Every commercial software program goes through different phases in its life
cycle. For instance, a typical program might begin in a development phase
for code writing, move into a Q/A phase for testing, and finally reach a
production version for official release. In some companies, the movement
through these "stages" is so informal that it's barely recognized. In
others, systematic controls exist to control the life cycle of an
application from inception to release. But, in any environment, the program
must progress through stages, and when a version control or configuration
management tool is used, that tool must ensure that the right people are
working with the right version of the software.
<P>
Many version control systems use the phrase "promotion modeling" to
describe this aspect of their functionality. However, Visual SourceSafe
does not use the words "promotion" or "life cycle" at all. There are two
reasons that the Visual SourceSafe designers avoided this terminology in
their product:

<OL><P><LI>There is no accepted industry definition of the "promotion" feature. For
   instance, PVCS by Intersolv "promotes" files by labeling them;
   CCC:Manager by Softool "promotes" a configuration by copying it into a
   directory.

<P><LI>Life-cycle management is determined by the needs of the individual
   company. Products that "hard-code" a specific methodology are often
   viewed as restrictive, forcing all users to conform to the model
   preferred by the program designers.
<P>
</OL>For these reasons, rather than providing a specific "promotion" feature,
SourceSafe provides flexible project-level branching, and file and project
labeling schemes that can be used to implement a variety of life cycle
methodologies. This article describes a few specific scenarios, and how
they can be handled by SourceSafe.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Directory-based Promotion</h3>
 
<P>
Directory-based promotion, analogous to "promotion" in CCC:Manager, is the
simplest case, but also the most common. For example, you would create a
directory for use in testing. You might give only the project manager the
right to create files in this directory, and only the Q/A department the
right to read these files. When a project is ready for its first round of
testing, the project manager would GET the Project into the testing
directory. The Q/A team would then work with that code exclusively. Note
that SourceSafe allows you to GET either an entire project or a specific
file. Therefore, if different files are approved for testing individually,
each file can be retrieved into the testing directory at the appropriate
time.
<P>
Advantages of this system are that it is very simple, it gives each group
access to the appropriate files, it does not require Q/A people to use
SourceSafe at all, it provides for tight security, etc. However, two
notable disadvantages are that the directory itself is not under version
control. Therefore, there is no automatic way to go back to an earlier
version of the testing directory. Second, the testing people cannot,
themselves, make any changes to the code. For many companies, these
disadvantages are small or irrelevant. However, companies needing to track
their incremental stages more closely need to use some of SourceSafe’s more
advanced features.
<P>
<P><h3>File and Project Labeling</h3>
 
<P>
Visual SourceSafe uses file and project labeling as a way to record the
different stages that a program goes through. This method is analogous to
the "promotion" mechanism in PVCS. A "label" in SourceSafe is a named
snapshot in time. For instance, you might "label" a project with the label
"Test." This does not freeze or stop development progress. Rather, it
associates the string "Test" with this particular moment in the life of the
project. At any time in the future, you can ask SourceSafe to retrieve
version "Test" of this project, and it will give you the files that were in
the project at the time when you applied the label. Labels can also be
applied to an individual file. Therefore, you might label one file "Test"
today, and another file "Test" tomorrow.
<P>
Labeling is often used in conjunction with directories as a way of
recording when a particular stage was released. For instance, you might
label a project Release 2.01 and then GET the project into a production
directory. Later, if that directory has been destroyed or altered, you can
recreate it simply by telling SourceSafe to GET version Release 2.01 of the
project.
<P>
File and project labeling goes a step beyond directories, because it
creates a permanent record of what files made up any particular stage.
However, it still does not allow for parallel development. In other words,
simultaneous changes cannot be made on the development and testing
configurations of a program. For that level of flexibility, project-level
branching is required.
<P>
<P><h3>Project Level Branch and Merge</h3>
 
<P>
A complete discussion of project-level branching is beyond the scope of
this article. The issue is explained in detail in the Visual SourceSafe
documentation. However, it should be mentioned how some companies use
SourceSafe’s unique branching capabilities to control promotion in this
flexible way.
<P>
Suppose the project $/Word is in development and reaches the testing stage.
At this point, the project manager creates a static branch project called
$/WordTest. (This is a one-step operation: in SourceSafe terminology, you
Share an old version of the project.) The developers continue to work on
$/Word and the Q/A department works on $/WordTest. As in the above methods,
the Q/A department is working on its own frozen copy and the developers
continue to work on the original project. Unlike the above methods,
however, the testing team can begin to make changes to its own project,
which is tracked separately. Using the Visual SourceSafe project security
system, you can ensure that the developers cannot modify the $/WordTest
project and the testers have no access to the original $/Word project.
<P>
Changes can be "migrated" from one project to another in one of two ways:
You can delete a file from one project and then re-Share it from the other.
This is analogous to standard CCC:Manager migration, which simply replaces
one file with another. Or you can merge a file from one project to the
other, which brings together both sets of changes.
<P>
Branching is always a complex topic and merging may involve conflicts. For
the needs of most corporations, creating and maintaining multiple branches
is overkill. However, for companies needing to control and develop multiple
stages of a single application, project-level branching provides a complete
solution with powerful security and flexibility.
<P>
<P><h3>Others</h3>
 
<P>
The above three methods are all "idealized" cases. While many companies can
use them exactly as described, many others will need to use combinations of
directories, project labels, branching, and other Visual SourceSafe
features. The SourceSafe feature set is designed to accommodate as many
different environments and methodologies as possible, while maintaining the
elegance and ease of use of the product’s core functionality.
