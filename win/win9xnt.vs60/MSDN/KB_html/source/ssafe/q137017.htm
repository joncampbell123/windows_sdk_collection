The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, versions 4.0, 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows NT, versions 4.0, 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows 95, versions 4.0, 5.0

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Several types of files make up your Visual Basic application; some need to
be controlled, and some don't. Keep the following in mind when you are
deciding which files to add to your source code controller (Visual
SourceSafe):

<UL><LI>Custom files (files that you have customized for a particular
   application) should be added to your source code controller.

<LI>Files that are "off the shelf" or that can be generated by using other
   files that are under source code control probably don't need to be
   controlled by your source code controller.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Project Files</h3>
 
<P>
The following file types make up your Visual Basic version 4.0 project and
are automatically pulled into your source code controller if you specify:
<P>
<PRE>   .frm, .frx - form
   .bas       - visual module
   .cls       - class module (new in Visual Basic version 4.0)
   .vbp       - project make file (same as the .mak file in earlier
                versions)

</PRE>When a form is first added to a project and saved, the .frm file is
created. The .frm file is a text file that contains the source code for the
form along with information about the positions and properties of the
controls on that form. Once any graphic controls (such as a picture box or
grid) are added and the form is saved, the .frx file is automatically
created to hold the binary information about the graphic controls. It is
very important that both files are controlled together -- checked out and
in together -- even though the .frm file is text and the .frx file is
binary.
<P>
The following additional file types may also be a part of your Visual Basic
version 4.0 project. You should add these files manually to SourceSafe so
they can be controlled, especially if they are customized:
<P>
<PRE>   .ini       - initialization file (for 16-bit applications only)
   .bmp, .ico, .rle, .wmf, .emf, .dib - graphics

</PRE>The following file types are not automatically pulled into your source code
controller. You can add these files to SourceSafe, but it is not necessary.
<P>
<PRE>   .exe       - application executable
   .dll       - application dynamic link library
   .res       -

</PRE>You should only store copies of these binary files in SourceSafe if you do
not have the source code for them. For example, if your project calls a
third-party-compiled dll, store the dll in SourceSafe. If your project
builds a dll, do not store the dll in SourceSafe, just the files necessary
to build it.
<P>
<P><h3>Database and Other Data Files</h3>
 
<P>
In general, you should not store data files in SourceSafe. If you do, these
should be only small data files used for testing your application, not live
data files.
<P>
The following are additional file types that may be a part of your Visual
Basic version 4.0 project. These files can be added to SourceSafe and
controlled if you choose:
<P>
<PRE>   .mdb       - Microsoft Access database
   .dbf, .ndx, .mdx - dBASE table and index files
   .dat, .ddf - Btrieve database and index
   .dbf, .dbc, .cdx, .idx - FoxPro free table, database container, and
                            index files
   .dat       - data file created for your application
   .txt       - text file created for your application
   .xls       - Microsoft Excel file created for your application

</PRE><h3>Custom Control and Registry Files</h3>
 
<P>
The following additional file types may be a part of your Visual Basic
version 4.0 project. These files need to be added to SourceSafe if they
have been customized:
<P>
<PRE>   .vbr       - the registry file
   .tlb, .olb - type library
   .vbx       - custom control file for 16-bit applications only
   .ocx       - custom control file for both 16- and 32-bit applications
   .dll       - dependency file (listed in Swdepend.ini).
