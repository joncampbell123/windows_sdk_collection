The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multiuser skills.
<P>
If you use the Linked Table Manager to refresh the link to a table that is
under Source Code Control, and you do not have Data and Misc. Objects
checked out, Microsoft Access does not prompt you to check it out. When
you do check out Data and Misc. Objects, if the data to which the table
was originally linked is not available, you receive two error messages for
each linked table:
<P>
<PRE>   Couldn't find file '&lt;Database Name&gt;'
   An error occurred while trying to create the linked table '&lt;Table Name&gt;'

</PRE>After you click OK on the last error message, the linked tables are
deleted.
<P>
NOTE: If the data to which the table was originally linked is still
available when you check out Data and Misc. Objects, the table will revert
to the original link.
<P>
This article assumes that you are familiar with using the client-side
capabilities of Visual SourceSafe. For more information about Visual
SourceSafe, please refer to the "Visual SourceSafe User's Guide" or
Help available from the Visual SourceSafe Help menu.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Changes to objects that are not checked out are not saved. When you check
out a linked table, Microsoft Access tries to refresh the link. If the
data to which the table is linked is unavailable or has been moved to
another location, the link cannot be refreshed and the linked table is
removed.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Check out Data and Misc. Objects before you use the Linked Table Manager
to modify the linked tables.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Access 97. We
are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Note that any time you use Visual Basic for Applications code to modify an
object in a database that is under Source Code Control, you are not
prompted to check out the object. This behavior is by design; however
wizards that modify objects through code should prompt you to check out
the object.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create a new database called VssTest.mdb.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, point to SourceSafe, and then click "Add Database to
    SourceSafe."

<P><LI>Check out Data and Misc. Objects from SourceSafe.

<P><LI>Link to the Customers table in the sample database Northwind.mdb.

<P><LI>Check in Data and Misc. Objects, which now contains the linked table.

<P><LI>Quit Microsoft Access 97.

<P><LI>Locate Northwind.mdb and change its name to Northwind1.mdb.

<P><LI>Start Microsoft Access and open VssTest.mdb.

<P><LI>Refresh the link to the Customers table by pointing to Add-Ins on the
    Tools menu, and then clicking Linked Table Manager.

<P><LI>Check out Data and Misc. Objects from SourceSafe.

<P><LI>Click OK on both error messages and note that the linked table no
    longer appears in the Database window.
