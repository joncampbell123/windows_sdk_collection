The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, versions 4.0, 5.0
<LI>Microsoft SourceSafe for Windows, versions 3.04, 3.1
<LI>Microsoft SourceSafe for Windows NT, versions 3.04, 3.1

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If you have shared and separated your working files in SourceSafe and
have made changes to each of the versions, you may wish to have these
changes reflected in a final project. If multiple checkouts are enabled
and more than one user has the file out for editing, you may want to
have all the changes reflected in the final project. The MERGE command
(Merge Branches in Visual SourceSafe 4.0) allows this capability.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The MERGE command (Merge Branches in Visual SourceSafe 4.0)takes the two
ASCII text files and combines them. SourceSafe merges the original file
(the last version of the file in SourceSafe prior to the separate or the
multiple checkout action) and the file copies which have been modified.
<P>
When two users have a file checked out, the first user to update can do
so with no problem. If there is a conflict (see next paragraph), the next
user is told that a conflict exists and asked if the files were merged.
The file will be copied to the Working directory with the conflicts marked.
You should manually edit the file to resolve the conflicts and update the
file.
<P>
As an example of a conflict, suppose that the original file contains the
following line of code: X = 4. This original file is checked out by two
users through either the multiple checkout or the share and separate
(Branch in Visual SourceSafe 4.0). If one user changes the line of code
to read: X = 5 and the other user changes the same line of code to read:
X = 3, there is now a conflict. The first person to check in changes and
merge has no problem. When the second person tries to check in the file
and merge, the following message is given:
<P>
<PRE>   An automatic merge has occurred and there are conflicts.
   Edit &lt;path&gt;\&lt;filename&gt; to resolve them.

</PRE>The file has the following:
<P>
<PRE>      &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; $/&lt;project1&gt;/&lt;filename&gt;
      X = 3
      =======
      X = 5
      &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; $/&lt;project2&gt;/&lt;filename&gt;

</PRE>When manually editing, you have to strip out the &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; comments and
decide which of the two changes should really be there. Then when you try
to check in the conflict modified file and merge, you get the following
message:
<P>
<PRE>     &lt;filename&gt; has been merged with no conflicts. Update Now?

</PRE>This message just makes sure that the conflicts have been fixed. Answer Yes
and continue with your work. The changes are now merged.
<P>
NOTE: Merging only works correctly on ASCII files. For instance, FoxPro's
SCX and SCT files or Visual Basic's FRX files are binary files and will
not be merged correctly by SourceSafe.
<P>
To summarize:

<OL><P><LI>Checkout, modify, and Update (Check in Visual SourceSafe 4.0)
   $/PROJECT/STARS.BAS. Highlight the file in the SourceSafe interface.

<P><LI>Select Merge (Merge Branches in Visual SourceSafe 4.0) from the
   SourceSafe menu.

<P><LI>The dialog lists a shared version of the file, as well as separated
   versions. Highlight the specific version you wish to merge with.

<P><LI>Select the Merge push button.

<P><LI>If there are any conflicts, you will be asked to resolve the conflicts
   and update the resulting file.
<P></OL>
