The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 16-bit and 32-bit, for Windows,

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Visual SourceSafe operates more slowly when it checks out a file than when
it gets a file. This is especially evident in the Visual SourceSafe
integration with other products.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Following are the steps that Visual SourceSafe goes through when it checks
out a file. The order of the steps depends on the system configuration and
the user s actions, so these steps may not occur in this exact order:

<OL><P><LI>Your user rights are verified to make sure that you have the proper
   access rights for the operation.

<P><LI>Visual SourceSafe checks to see if the file is currently checked out by
   you or any other user.

<P><LI>If someone has the file checked out already, the multiple checkouts
   setting is selected. (This applies only to text files because binary
   files cannot be set up for multiple checkouts.) If the other user
   currently has the file checked out and is checking the file out again to
   the same directory, the operation fails. If the other user currently has
   the file checked out and is checking the file out again to a different
   directory, the operation works.

<P><LI>If Visual SourceSafe verifies that you can check the file out, then the
   log file is written with a checkout record for you.

<P><LI>The Status.dat file is updated.

<P><LI>Visual SourceSafe looks for a Replace_Writable variable and, depending
   on that setting, will skip the file, replace the file, or merge the
   file.

<P><LI>A GET happens.
<P>
</OL>This procedure causes the checkout operation to go much slower than when
SourceSafe gets a file. Following are the steps that Visual SourceSafe goes
through when it gets a file:

<OL><P><LI>Your user rights are checked to see if you have the proper access rights
   for the operation.

<P><LI>Visual SourceSafe looks for a Replace_Writable variable and, depending
   on that setting, skips the file, replaces the file, or merges the file.

<P><LI>A GET happens.
<P>
</OL>Most users of Visual SourceSafe are running over a local area network; the
network file I/O and data transfer slow down the checkout operation
even more. Note that users of Microsoft Visual FoxPro see a larger
delay due to the intermediate text files that are generated from the FoxPro
binary files. This step does not occur in Visual Basic or Visual C++.
