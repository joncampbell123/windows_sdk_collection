The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Standard, Professional, and Enterprise Editions of Microsoft Visual
   Basic, 16-bit and 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, version 4.0
</UL>

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If the VBX files are not properly installed, Visual Basic normally displays
a "File didn't load, do you want to continue" dialog when a Visual Basic
project, which uses licensed VBX files, is opened.
<P>
However, when opening a Visual Basic project via the "Open New SourceSafe
Project" add-in menu item, if the VBX cannot find its license, the VBX
fails to load. Visual Basic stops loading the project at that point. There
are no error messages displayed, however, the Project window is empty.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Visual SourceSafe uses the Visual Basic Add-in model
Application.LoadProject command when loading the Visual Basic project.
Visual Basic goes into "silent" mode, and does not inform the user or the
add-in control about any errors it encounters while loading the project. If
errors are encountered, Visual Basic just stops the loading process at the
point the problem is encountered.
<P>
This problem can occur if the VBX software is not installed properly on the
machine where the problem is appearing. Therefore, the VBX refuses to load
because it cannot find a license file in the Windows system directory when
trying to load.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
You can work around this problem by properly installing the third-party VBX
files. Verify all the license files are properly installed in the directory
where your Windows system files are stored. The loading problems should
cease.
<P>
If properly installing the VBX files does not fix the problem, then make
the project files available on your local machine by starting up the
SourceSafe Explorer and executing a Get of the project files to a location
on your machine. Then start Visual Basic, and open the project via the File
Open Project command. If Visual Basic has any problems loading files, then
the "File didn't load, do you want to continue" dialog displays and you
will know what file is causing the problem.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a issue in Visual Basic version 4.0 for
Windows. We are researching this issue and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
