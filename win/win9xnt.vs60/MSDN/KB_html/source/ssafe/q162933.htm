The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multi-user skills.
<P>
When you try to check out a module for which you have no Microsoft Access
permissions, you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   You don't have permissions to modify '&lt;object name&gt;.'

   To modify this object you must have Modify Design permission for it.
   If the object is a table, you must also have Delete Data and Update
   Data permissions for it. For more information on permissions and who
   can set them, click Help.

</PRE>You will then receive a Visual SourceSafe error that states that the
object was not imported.
<P>
Although the module is not replaced and the permissions are enforced as
expected, the module appears as "checked out." You are then not
allowed to either check in or undo the checkout. The Admin user must check
it in.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Adding a secure database to Visual Source Safe will not remove security on
the local version of that database. Visual Source Safe and Microsoft Access
will function normally, as long as the users have permissions to modify
objects in the local database. If they log in as someone who doesn't, then
they will be able to check out an object but not be able to make changes to
it.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
If you delete the local version of the database and create a new one from
Visual Source Safe, then the resulting database will not have any of the
security permissions in it.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create a new database and name it vssTest.mdb.

<P><LI>Create a new module and name it modVssTest. Save the module.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Security, and select "User and Group
    Accounts."

<P><LI>Click the Change Password Tab and give Admin a new password of
    "admin" (without the quotation marks).

<P><LI>Click the Users tab, and click New.

<P><LI>Create a new user with a name of "test" (without the quotation
    marks) and a Personal ID of "1234" (without the quotation marks).
 
<P><LI>Click OK.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Security, and select "User and Group
    Permissions."

<P><LI>Click to select Groups.

<P><LI>Select Users in the Users/Group Name box and revoke all permissions for
    Users on modVssTest by clicking to clear the Read Design check box.

<P><LI>Click OK.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, click SourceSafe, and select "Add Database to
    SourceSafe."

<P><LI>Close Microsoft Access.

<P><LI>Restart Microsoft Access and log in as "test" (without the quotation
    marks).

<P><LI>Open vssTest.mdb.

<P><LI>Using the right mouse button, click modVssTest, and click Check Out.

<P><LI>Note that you receive the first of error messages mentioned in the
    "Symptoms" sections. Click OK, and then OK on the next error message.
    Note that the Object shows in the database container as checked out.

<P><LI>Using the right mouse button, click modVssTest and click Check In. Note
    that you receive an error message that "You don't have permission to
    read '&lt;object name&gt;'". Click OK. Note that you receive an error message
    from SourceSafe that it failed to export the object.

<P><LI>Close Microsoft Access.

<P><LI>Open Microsoft Access and log in as Admin with password "admin"
    (without the quotation marks).

<P><LI>Open vssTest.mdb.

<P><LI>Using the right mouse button, click modVssTest and select Check In.
    The admin user is able to check the object back into SourceSafe.
