<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
SourceSafe can be used to store Visual Basic source files. The following
tips can make this process easier.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Moving Between Visual Basic and SourceSafe</h3>
 
<P>
When first adding a project to SourceSafe, it is important to set the
working directory (CTRL-D) where you want to store files that you are
working with. While this could be the directory that Visual Basic is in,
this is not recommended. For maintenance reasons, you should store a
Visual Basic project in its own directory.
<P>
Typically, SourceSafe is only used when you check out and update files, so
it is generally used only two or three times a day. As a result, the most
common configuration is to have Visual Basic up, and leave SourceSafe
minimized in the corner. When you need to check out or update a file,
double-click SourceSafe, and make the necessary changes. Then you minimize
SourceSafe, and you're back in Visual Basic, immediately ready to return
to work.
<P>
<P><h3>Visual Basic Projects and SourceSafe Projects</h3>
 
<P>
For each Visual Basic project you have, create a SourceSafe project. Add
to that SourceSafe project all the .FRM, .FRX, .BAS, and .TXT files, as
well as the .MAK file. Bitmaps, icons, and metafiles embedded in either
the picture or icon properties of a Visual Basic form or control are
stored in the .FRX file. However, any icon or bitmap files referenced by
the Visual Basic project and not part of a form, picture control, or image
control should be added as well.
<P>
Also, be sure to save the Visual Basic forms and modules as text. By
saving as text, you can take full advantage of the diff and merge
capabilities of SourceSafe. By default, Visual Basic saves forms and
modules in binary format. You can update existing forms and modules by
choosing Save File As from the File Menu, and then selecting the Save as
Text check box.
<P>
You can configure Visual Basic so that it always saves forms and modules
as text. From the Options menu, choose Environment. Then in the list box
that comes up, change the "Default Save as Format" to indicate "Text."
Then all new forms and modules will be saved as text.
<P>
It is probably best not to add .VBX files to the SourceSafe project
because the .VBX files are usually stored in the Windows' System
directory. The best way to store .VBX files in SourceSafe is to create a
separate project that stores all the .VBX files you use.
<P>
<P><h3>Checking Out Files</h3>
 
<P>
The SourceSafe system is built on the assumption that you always check out
a file before making changes to it. This can take a while to get used to
if you have never used version control, but it is vitally important that
you always do so.
<P>
To help you remember, SourceSafe flags files read-only when you do not
have them checked out. Visual Basic signals this by putting a little red
padlock symbol in the lower-left corner of the form icon file whenever the
form file is read-only, so glance down before making changes to be sure
the file can be changed.
<P>
However, Visual Basic does not indicate if the .MAK file has been checked
out with any visual clue that is visible within Visual Basic. To be sure,
you can switch to SourceSafe, and see if the file is checked out. Visual
Basic stores a lot of information about the state of a project and its
contents in the .MAK file, so it is probably safest to assume that if you
check out any one file in your Visual Basic project, you should check out
the .MAK file as well.
<P>
In addition, if you have any graphics embedded in your form, such as a
bitmap, metafile, or icon, you need to check out the file with the .FRX
extension for that form, or you won't be able to make any changes to the
graphics used on that form.
<P>
If you do forget to check out a file and you make a lot of changes, you
will find out the hard way when you try to save. When you see the error
"XXX.FRM is a read-only file," proceed with caution. You can check out the
file now and save your changes, but if another programmer has changed the
file since you last got it from SourceSafe, you will wipe out his changes,
which defeats the purpose of SourceSafe. So before you check out, use the
Diff command to see if your (pre-saved) file is the latest in SourceSafe.
If there are no differences between your local copy and the latest
SourceSafe version, simply check out the file and save your changes. If
there are differences, you need to reconcile the differences between your
local copy and the latest version in SourceSafe.
<P>
<P><h3>Using Diff with Form Files</h3>
 
<P>
SourceSafe's ability to store disk-efficient changes works with any file,
but its ability to report line-by-line changes to the user or to merge
disparate sets of changes works only on text files. Therefore, if you save
your form files as text and understand the format that Visual Basic uses,
you can take better advantage of SourceSafe's full capabilities.
<P>
The following example should help you understand the text form file
format. This file describes a form with a single textbox on it:
<P>
<PRE>      Begin Form Form1
         Caption         =   "Form1"
         ClientHeight    =   4020
         ClientLeft      =   1080
         ClientTop       =   1545
         ClientWidth     =   7365
         Height          =   4425
         Left            =   1020
         LinkTopic       =   "Form1"
         ScaleHeight     =   4020
         ScaleWidth      =   7365
         Top             =   1200
         Width           =   7485
         Begin TextBox Text1
            Height          =   495
            Left            =   3120
            TabIndex        =   0
            Text            =   "Text1"
            Top             =   1800
            Width           =   1215
         End
      End

</PRE>Note that the text box's properties are specified between the Begin
TextBox Text1 section and End. If you change the Text property of the text
box, SourceSafe will output a line like this:
<P>
<PRE>      19 Change:   Text = "Text1"
      To:          Text = "Hello"

</PRE>To determine which object is associated with the modified property, you
need to find the Begin &lt;object&gt; statement immediately prior to line 19.
Note that the Visual Diff feature of SourceSafe version 3.0 provides an
easy way to do this, as you can simply scroll backwards from the changed
property until you see the Begin &lt;object&gt; statement.
<P>
<P><h3>Sharing Common Files</h3>
 
<P>
If you have a set of .BAS files that are used in more than one project,
use SourceSafe's Share command to share the files in each of the projects
they are used in. Then, any time enhancements or bug fixes are made to
these files the changes propagate automatically to all the projects that
share them. You can use the Links command to get a list of all the
projects that share a .BAS file, which can be useful in determining which
programs need to be recompiled after a change.
<P>
<P><h3>Merging Visual Basic Files</h3>
 
<P>
The Merge command works only on text files and it expects the source files
to be in relatively the same format. For example, if procedures are
located randomly throughout the file or if the position for many of the
existing procedures changes dramatically, SourceSafe may not be able to
adequately determine if the procedure is the same between the two files
because it can't locate the procedure between the different versions of
the file. This may result in SourceSafe seeing the whole procedure as
different even though it may not have changed. Visual Basic writes out
procedures in a random formation to the .FRM and .BAS files, so the
SourceSafe Merge command may not work as expected on these file types.
<P>
An alternative is to get the desired versions to two different locations
and merge the file manually.
