<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes two methods of sharing files in SourceSafe. In
addition, the article shows how to identify shared files and how they are
shared.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This article demonstrates two ways to share files. The conventional way of
sharing files is the sharing the most recent version of the files. You can
also share a specific version of a file. This feature allows you to stay
at a particular version of a file in one project, while making changes to
the file in another project.
<P>
While the multiple pages icon indicates that a file has been shared, you
may forget where the file is located in other projects. The LINKS command
can display the locations of the shared file in other projects.
<P>
<P><h3>Example 1 - Sharing the most recent version of the files</h3>
 
<P>
This example demonstrates the conventional way of sharing files, sharing
the most recent version of the files. The project &lt;orig. project&gt; is the
project which contains the files to be shared. The project &lt;new project&gt;
is the project that will receive a copy of the files to be shared.

<OL><P><LI>Create a new project ($/&lt;new project&gt;).

<P><LI>Highlight the newly created project and select Share from the
   SourceSafe menu. Select $/&lt;orig. project&gt;/&lt;files to share&gt; in the
   Files list box.

<P><LI>Select the Share push button
<P>
</OL>A multiple-page icon indicates that the file has been shared. The files to
share now exist in both the $/&lt;orig. project&gt; and $/&lt;new project&gt;
projects. If a file is removed from the $/&lt;orig. project&gt; project, it
still exists in the $/&lt;new project&gt; project, and therefore, there will be
no regained disk space.
<P>
<P><h3>Example 2 - Sharing a specific version of a file</h3>
 
<P>
You can also share a specific version of a file. This feature allows you
to stay at a particular version of a file in one project, while making
changes to the file in another project. You can later share the recent
version, or return to the default of always sharing the most recent
version of the file.

<OL><P><LI>Highlight a file in the $\&lt;orig. project&gt; project.

<P><LI>Select the History toolbar button (or History from the Info menu).

<P><LI>Select Revision 1, when the file was created.

<P><LI>Select the Share push button.

<P><LI>Select the Close push button.
<P>
</OL>View $\&lt;new project&gt;\&lt;file&gt; and $\&lt;orig. project&gt;\&lt;file&gt; and notice that
they do not appear the same. $\&lt;orig. project&gt; is sharing the original
file, while $\&lt;new project&gt;\&lt;file&gt; points to the latest revision. If you
would like to update $\&lt;orig. project&gt; to the latest version:

<OL><P><LI>Select the History toolbar button (or History from the Info menu).

<P><LI>Highlight the latest version and select the Share push button.

<P><LI>You will be prompted "Do you always want to share the latest version?".
   Select Yes.

<P><LI>Select Close.
<P>
</OL>If you look at the files now, you should see the most recent copy in both
of the projects.
