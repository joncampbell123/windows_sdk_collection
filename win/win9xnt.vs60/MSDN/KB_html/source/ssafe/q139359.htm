</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Back Up Your Visual SourceSafe Database</h3>
 
<P>
Before installing an upgrade to Visual SourceSafe, back up your previous
Visual SourceSafe database. The upgrade process involves a major data
conversion, which is irreversible in case of problems.
<P>
Once Visual SourceSafe is installed, you should still back up your database
on a very regular basis.
<P>
Database corruption is uncommon, but could occur. The Analyze.exe program
detects any problems in the database. A backup will help you recover
gracefully should you need to recreate your database. If you receive any
errors after running the Analyze program, please contact Microsoft Support.
For information on the Analyze.exe program, please see Appendix C in the
Microsoft Visual SourceSafe User's Guide or Help file for the Admin
program.
<P>
<P><h3>Visual SourceSafe 32-Bit and Visual SourceSafe 16-Bit</h3>
 
<P>
There are two versions of Visual SourceSafe for Windows: 32-bit and 16-bit.
<P>
Users of MS-DOS should use Visual SourceSafe for MS-DOS, a command-line
only product.
<P>
Users of Microsoft Windows 3.1 and Microsoft Windows for Workgroups should
use the 16-bit version of Visual SourceSafe for Windows.
<P>
Users of Microsoft Windows NT and Microsoft Windows 95 should use
the 32-bit version of Visual SourceSafe for Windows.
<P>
<P><h3>Notes for Users of Previous Versions of SourceSafe</h3>
 
<P>
Users of SourceSafe 3.x will note a number of major changes to the product.
New features are listed separately below, but some of the important
miscellaneous changes include:

<OL><P><LI>The SourceSafe directory structure has changed, and the SourceSafe
   program files have different names. For example, if you have an icon
   pointing to R:\Vss\Winnt\Ssnt.Exe, that directory and file no longer
   exist. The new location is R:\Vss\Win32\Ssexp.Exe. The client Setup
   program creates new program manager icons that point to the
   appropriate executables.

<P><LI>The SourceSafe text-based interface for MS-DOS (SS.EXE) is not supported
   in 4.0 or future versions of Visual SourceSafe.

<P><LI>Several SourceSafe commands have been renamed. The most prominent
   are:
<P>
<PRE>   Update     --&gt;  Check In
   Uncheckout --&gt;  Undo Checkout
   Separate   --&gt;  Branch
   Remove     --&gt;  Delete
   Scan       --&gt;  Find in Files
   Merge      --&gt;  Merge Branches

</PRE><P><LI>The PIN command is new. It replaces the SHARE command in the History of
   File dialog box and allows you to "stick a pin" through a specific
   version of a file, freezing it at that specific version. The PIN
   command's complement, the UNPIN command, allows you to "unstick" a file
   that has been pinned.
<P>
</OL><h3>Design Restriction in Visual Basic Integration</h3>
 
<P>
When you are working in Visual Basic with projects under source code
control, Visual Basic launches a new version of itself under the following
conditions: you open a project under source code control, use the Show
History command on a file associated with Visual Basic, and then click View
in the History dialog box. This is normal behavior also found when working
with a Visual Basic form from the File Manager in Windows NT and the
Explorer in Windows 95.
<P>
<P><h3>Need to Specify a Makefile Extension for Visual Basic Integration</h3>
 
<P>
In Windows 95, a Visual Basic project can have a make file with no
extension, or with an extension other than .vbp or .mak. However, the
source code control (SCC) Add-in has to have some way to recognize make
files from other files, and the extension is often the only way. In other
words, for you to use SCC successfully with a project, the make file name
must end in .vbp or .mak. The most likely situation where a make file has
no extension is when the Windows 95 Explorer is set to hide file
extensions. Then, when you save a make file, Visual Basic doesn't
automatically add the .vbp extension. The solution to this situation is to
set the Windows 95 Explorer view option to show file extensions, and ensure
that that all Visual Basic make files have a .vbp or .mak file extension.
<P>
<P><h3>Installing Two or More Visual SourceSafe Databases on One Computer</h3>
 
<P>
The Visual SourceSafe installation was designed for one installation per
computer. There might be occasions when you want to have two or more copies
of Visual SourceSafe installed on your computer, such as in the following
cases:
<P>
Case 1. You are an administrator who wants both a server and a client
installation on your computer. To accomplish this, you run Setup from your
Visual SourceSafe compact disc, and then use the Netsetup program from the
directory in which you installed the Visual SourceSafe server option.
<P>
Case 2. You need to have separate databases for testing, application
development, and maintaining product specifications. You want to have
different locations on your computer that point to different network
locations you can access. To accomplish this, use the Regedit program in
Windows NT or Windows 95. Go to the HK_LOCAL_MACHINE key, then to SOFTWARE,
then to MS SETUP (ACME), then to TABLE FILES. You see two entries for
Visual SourceSafe: Ssadmin.exe file, for the server installation from the
compact disc, and Ssexp.exe for the network client setup. Delete one of
these two entries, and then run Setup again. Note that you can have only
one Visual SourceSafe installation at a time integrated with Visual Basic
on a local hard disk.
<P>
When you work with two separate network installations, only one can be
integrated with an IDE at a time. For example, say you want to switch from
database1, which is currently active, to database2. To switch between
Visual SourceSafe databases and maintain IDE integration, go to the \Win or
\Win32 directory under the directory in which you installed Visual
SourceSafe on your local hard disk, and run the Ssint program. The Ssint
program's dialog box contains the check box, Update Vb.ini, that allows you
switch to the version of Visual SourceSafe you want to use by choosing to
update Vb.ini or not.
