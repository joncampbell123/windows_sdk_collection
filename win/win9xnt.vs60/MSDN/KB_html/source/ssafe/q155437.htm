The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 16-bit and 32-bit, for Windows,
   versions 4.0, 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
While doing a GET or VIEW from the Show History dialog, a Check In of a
large file, or a Difference on a large file, the user gets the following
message:
<P>
<PRE>  "Invalid DOS path &lt;drive&gt;:&lt;path&gt;"

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Temp_Path setting in the SRCSAFE.INI file is set to an invalid
directory.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Edit the SRCSAFE.INI file and change the Temp_Path setting to an existing
directory.
<P>
If Temp_Path is set to a network drive make sure that the network
connection is stable.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The SRCSAFE.INI file has an initialization variable called Temp_Path. This
tells Visual SourceSafe where to put its temporary files. If Temp-Path is
set to a non-existent location, an error will occur when Visual SourceSafe
attempts to access the non-existent location.
<P>
Visual SourceSafe will use a temporary directory when any one of the
following actions is performed:

<OL><P><LI>Doing a GET of an older version of a file from the Show History dialog
   that it can't fit into memory. This is more likely to happen with binary
   files.

<P><LI>Doing a VIEW of an older version of a file from the Show History dialog.

<P><LI>Doing a Check In of a large file that it can't fit into memory. This is
   more likely to happen with binary files.

<P><LI>Doing a Difference on a large file that it can't fit into memory. This
   is more likely to happen with binary files.
<P>
</OL>If the Temp_Path in the SRCSAFE.INI file is invalid, it may corrupt the
file when any of the previously-mentioned actions are performed. By
default, Temp_Path is set to a directory called "temp" that is created by
the server installation. Therefore, this situation should only arise if a
user has edited the SRCSAFE.INI file.
