<UL><LI>Microsoft SourceSafe for Windows, versions 4.0, 5.0
<LI>Microsoft SourceSafe for Windows NT, versions 4.0, 5.0
<LI>Microsoft SourceSafe for Windows 95, versions 4.0, 5.0

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If a form with both an .frm and an .frx file exists in Visual Basic and
in SourceSafe and the form is deleted from the Visual Basic project, adding
a new form with the same name as the deleted form will omit adding the
.frx file to the SourceSafe project.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
In Steps to Reproduce Problem in the MORE INFORMATION section below, do the
following between steps 3 and 4:

<OL><P><LI>Run SourceSafe.

<P><LI>Select the SourceSafe project that stores the Visual Basic project.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Properties.

<P><LI>From the Deleted Items tab, purge the .frx and .frm that were deleted.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed
at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will
post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create a form that has both an .frm and .frx file (binary) in Visual
   Basic by adding a control (such as a picturebox, grid, or other control)
   that contains binary information to a form. Then put the files in
   SourceSafe.

<P><LI>Check out the Project (.vbp file) from SourceSafe.

<P><LI>In Visual Basic, delete the form. Note that both the .frm and .frx
   files are deleted in SourceSafe.

<P><LI>In Visual Basic, create a new form that has the same name as the deleted
   form, which will require an .frx file (as described in Step 1.)

<P><LI>Save the new form, and when prompted, add the form to SourceSafe.

<P><LI>Answer No to the following prompt:
<P>
   A deleted file with this name already exists. Recover the existing file?

<P><LI>The .frm file is added to SourceSafe, but the .frx is not.
