The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 16-bit and 32-bit, for Windows,
   versions 4.0, 4.0a
<LI>Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 32-bit, for Windows, version 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you check in files from the Command Line, you may receive the message:
<P>
<PRE>   File "&lt;filename&gt;" not found

</PRE>where &lt;filename&gt; is the name of the file you want to check in. This message
appears if the following four conditions exist:

<OL><P><LI>You changed the working directory for the file prior to checking it out.

<P><LI>You did not close the Visual SourceSafe Explorer after changing the
   working directory.

<P><LI>As indicated in your Ss.ini file, your current SourceSafe project is set
   to the wrong project, not the project that you are attempting to check
   it into. This setting is saved as:
<P>
   ; Your current SourceSafe project.
   Project = &lt;ProjectName&gt;

<P><LI>The FORCE_DIR entry in your Ss.ini file is set to NO.
<P>
</OL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When checking in a file, the Visual SourceSafe Command Line examines your
Ss.ini file to determine the working directory for a given project. When
you change the working directory in the Visual SourceSafe Explorer, the
change is cached in memory until the Visual SourceSafe Explorer is closed.
This means that the Ss.ini will not be updated until you close Visual
SourceSafe. Consequently, if you change a file s working directory and then
check it out, the Visual SourceSafe Explorer sees the updated working
directory but the Command Line does not.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 

<UL><LI>Check in the file using the Visual SourceSafe Explorer.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>If you change the working directory and intend to use any Command Line
   functions, close and restart the Visual SourceSafe Explorer.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Open your Ss.ini file and verify that the setting FORCE_DIR=NO is
   present. (If it is not, set it to FORCE_DIR=NO.)

<P><LI>Open or switch to Visual SourceSafe Explorer.

<P><LI>Select any project and set its working directory to "C:\Test . (If the
   directory doesn't exist, create it.)

<P><LI>Activate $/ as the current project by double-clicking it. Close and
   restart Visual SourceSafe Explorer.

<P><LI>Select the project from step 2 and reset its working directory to
   "C:\Test2". (If the directory doesn't exist, create it.)

<P><LI>Check out a file from the project. It will be checked out to C:\Test2.

<P><LI>Minimize Visual SourceSafe and Open a DOS Box. If you are running on a
   32-bit operating system, switch to the \Vss\Win32 subdirectory. If you
   are not, switch to the WIN subdirectory.

<P><LI>Type the following command:
<P>
   SS CHECKIN $/&lt;projectname/filename&gt;
<P>
   where &lt;projectname/filename&gt; is the Visual SourceSafe path and file name
   of the file checked out in step 5. You get the following message:
<P>
   $/&lt;projectname/filename&gt; was checked out from C:\Test2, not from the
   current directory. Continue anyway?(Y/N)
<P>
   N cancels the Check-In. Y prompts the following message:
<P>
   File "C:\Test1\&lt;filename&gt;" not found
<P>
   where &lt;filename&gt; is the name of the file checked out in step 5.
<P>
</OL>Note that If you repeat these steps with the Ss.ini file set to
FORCE_DIR=YES, the error will not occur.
