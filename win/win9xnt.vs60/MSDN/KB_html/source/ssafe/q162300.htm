The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article explains how you can convert a Visual FoxPro 3.0 project that
is under Source Code Control (SCC) to a Visual FoxPro 5.0 project while
maintaining it under Source Code Control.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Use the following steps to convert a Visual FoxPro 3.0 project that is
under Source Code Control:

<OL><P><LI>Back up the Source Code Control provider database and any files for the
   Visual FoxPro 3.0 project that you are converting.

<P><LI>Run the SCC provider and logon.

<P><LI>Select the project to be converted--for example, a project named
   "SCCTST" under the Root Project ($). Then click Check Out on the Visual
   SourceSafe menu.

<P><LI>In the Check Out dialog box, make sure that the "TO" text box contains
   the Path and the name of the working directory, for example
   "C:\Wdscctst."

<P><LI>Click Recursive and then OK.

<P><LI>Once the Check Out process is completed, run Visual FoxPro 5.0.

<P><LI>Click Options on the Visual FoxPro 5.0 Tools menu, and in the Projects
   tab ensure that the SCC Provider you want to use is selected as the
   "Active Source Control Provider."

<P><LI>MODIFY the Visual FoxPro 3.0 project(SCCTST)that was checked out in Step
   6 to the working directory (C:\Wdscctst).

<P><LI>When the "Visual FoxPro Converter" dialog box comes up, select any of
   the choices you want to. It is recommended that you use the default
   choices. Then click OK.

<P><LI>When the "Project has been moved" message comes up, click Yes. After
   the Project and its components are converted, Close and Save it.

<P><LI>Switch to the SCC provider. Select the Project (SCCTST) and click Check
   In on the Visual SourceSafe menu.

<P><LI>In the Check In dialog box, click Recursive and then OK.

<P><LI>Check out the files again from the SCC provider, using steps 3, 4, and
   5 above.

<P><LI>After the Check Out process is completed, switch to Visual FoxPro 5.0.

<P><LI>Modify the project SCCTST that was checked out to the working
   directory Wdscctst.

<P><LI>Click Add Project to Source Control on the Project menu. When prompted,
   logon to the SCC provider.

<P><LI>In the Add to Visual SourceSafe Project dialog box, enter the name of
   the project "SCCTST" in the "Project:" text box. Ensure that this name
   is exactly the same as the one displayed for the project in the Project
   Tree Structure under the "$/".

<P><LI>In the Project Tree Structure under "$/", select the project that is
   the parent of the project being converted. For example, if project
   "SCCTST" is a Sub-Project of the "Root Project" ($\SCCTST), then select
   the Root Project ($), and if SCCTST is a sub-project of "PSCCTST,"
   which in turn is a sub-project of "$" ($\PSCCTST\SCCTST), then select
   "PSCCTST."

<P><LI>Click OK. When the "Project Metafile created by Visual FoxPro" message
   is displayed click OK again.

<P><LI>When the Add Files to Source Control dialog box comes up, click  Select
   All and OK.

<P><LI>The "File is already controlled. Delete the local copy and get the
   latest version" dialog box appears several times. Click YES each time.

<P><LI>When the "Do you want to update the project list" dialog box is
   displayed, click Yes.

<P><LI>When the "File checked in from Visual FoxPro" message appears, click
   OK.
<P>
   NOTE: The Form (.scx), Label (.lpx), Menu (,mnx), Report (.frx), and
   Class Library(.vcx) files are in binary format and most SCC providers
   are not capable of maintaining the History/Version information for such
   files.
<P>
   To allow the SCC provider to keep track of the changes to the binary
   files,  Visual FoxPro 5.0 allows you to create files that are a Text
   representation of these binary files. The name of the text file is the
   same as the binary file except that the last letter of the extension is
   an "A" instead of an "X." For example *.SCA, *.LBA, *.MNA, *.FRA, and
   *.VCA for *.SCX, *.LBX, *.MNX, *.FRX, and *.VCX files, respectively.
<P>
   The text files are not added to the Project Manager so are not listed
   within the Project manager. These files are checked in and out
   automatically by Visual FoxPro 5.0 whenever their respective binary
   files are checked in and out.

<P><LI>To create text files for the binary files run Scctext.prg, installed
   to the Visual FoxPro 5.0 directory by default, against each of the
   files as follows:
<P>
<P><PRE>       DO SCCTEXT.PRG WITH "WDSCCTST\Forms\FormName.SCX"
       DO SCCTEXT.PRG WITH "WDSCCTST\Labels\LabelName.LBX"
       DO SCCTEXT.PRG WITH "WDSCCTST\Menus\MenuName.MNX"
       DO SCCTEXT.PRG WITH "WDSCCTST\Reports\ReportName.FRX"
       DO SCCTEXT.PRG WITH "WDSCCTST\Classes\ClassName.VCX"
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: The Text files are created in the same directory as each of the
   respective Binary files. For example FormName.SCA goes to the
   "WDSCCTST\Forms\" directory, ClassName.VCX to "WDSCCTST\Classes\"
   directory, and so on.

<P><LI>Once all the .sca, .lba, .mna, .fra, and .vca files are created, click
   Source Control, and then Check In from the Visual FoxPro 5.0 Project
   menu.

<P><LI>When the Check In dialog box appears, click Select All and then OK.

<P><LI>After the Check In process started with the previous step has
   completed, note that the text files ("*.??A") are not added to Source
   Control at this time. These files have to be added individually from
   the SCC provider.

<P><LI>Switch to the SCC provider and Check In each of the "*.??A" files into
   the specific folders of the SCC project (SCCTST). For example, *.sca
   files go to the Forms folder under "$\Scctst\," the *.fra  files go to
   the Reports folder, and so on. Once this is finished, the text files
   are checked out or checked in automatically whenever their  respective
   binary files are checked out/in from within Visual FoxPro 5.0 using the
   SCC Integration functionality.
<P>
   Now you should be able to use the Project under Visual FoxPro 5.0
   while retaining its Source Code Control functionality. Whenever you
   open the project (C:\Wdscctst\Scctst), Visual FoxPro 5.0
   automatically knows that it is under Source Control and provides
   the required functionality.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: Once the Project has been added to Source Control under Visual FoxPro
5.0, it is advised that the SCC operations should be performed from within
Visual FoxPro using the SCC Integration functionality.
<P>
NOTE: The above steps were tested with Microsoft Visual SourceSafe and are
specific to it. For Source Code Control providers other than Microsoft
Visual SourceSafe, you may need to modify the above steps or may have to do
additional steps.
