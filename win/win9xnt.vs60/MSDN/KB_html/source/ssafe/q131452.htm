The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, versions 4.0, 5.0
<LI>Microsoft SourceSafe for Windows, versions 3.04, 3.1
<LI>Microsoft SourceSafe for MS-DOS, versions 3.04, 3.1
<LI>Microsoft SourceSafe for Windows NT, versions 3.04, 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If a SourceSafe file has been shared and then separated, a rollback doesn't
restore the share information between files, but it does restore the file
contents.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The ROLLBACK command is very useful for undoing changes to a file within a
project. The one caveat to this is that the ROLLBACK command affects the
contents of the file but not the status of the file. If an item was shared
at version 20, separated at version 30, and rolled back to version 25, the
data appears as it did in version 25, but the file is still separated even
though the file was shared at this version previously.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create two projects (Proj1 and Proj2).

<P><LI>Add any file (File1) into Proj1.

<P><LI>Update the file twice so that there are some history items for the file.
   File1 should be on v3.

<P><LI>Share the file into Proj2. Make note of the links and paths.

<P><LI>Update the file two more times. File1 should be v5.

<P><LI>Separate the file in Proj2. Make note of the links and paths again.

<P><LI>Roll back the file to v3.
<P>
</OL>The links and paths will be the same as in step number 6, but the file is
now as it was at version 3.
