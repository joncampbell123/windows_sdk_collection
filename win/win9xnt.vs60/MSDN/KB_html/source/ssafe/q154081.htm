The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 16-bit and 32-bit, for Windows,
   versions 4.0, 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Each time a developer checks in a file, some SourceSafe administrators
would like a template for comments to appear. They can then prompt for
information that Keyword Expansion can't handle, such as what bug number
does this change fix? This article describes how to use a template for
comments. It should be noted that the template used appears anytime Visual
SourceSafe prompts for a comment, not just on Check Ins.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Comment template functionality acts slightly different on the Command
line versus the interface, as explained below:
<P>
<P><h3>In the Interface</h3>
 
<P>
The Comment template will appear in the Comment box of dialogs. To
implement this behavior, follow the steps below:

<OL><P><LI>Create and save a text file with the information that will be used as
   the template. This is the file that will be displayed for developers
   to fill out when they check in the file.

<P><LI>Add "Comment_Template= &lt;Path and Filename &gt;" to the Srcsafe.ini file.
   This lets Visual SourceSafe know which file is the template for
   comments.
<P>
</OL><h3>On the Command Line</h3>
 
<P>
The template appears in an editor that the user specifies. To implement
this behavior, follow the steps below:

<OL><P><LI>Create and save a text file with the information to be used as the
   template. This is the file that will be displayed to the developers for
   them to fill out when they check in the file.

<P><LI>Add "Comment_Template= &lt;Path and Filename&gt;" to the Srcsafe.ini file.
   This lets Visual SourceSafe know which file is the template for
   comments. Make sure this file can be opened by the Comment_Editor
   executable.

<P><LI>Add Comment_Editor= &lt;Path and Executable Name&gt; to the Srcsafe.ini file.
   This lets Visual SourceSafe know what editor to use to open the file
   indicated by the Comment_Template= INI setting. If users would like
   to use a different editor, they can set it in their Tools menu,
   Options... option, Command Line Options tab, Use editor to prompt
   for comments, and the Editor field.

<P><LI>Add Comment_Editor_Prompt= &lt;Yes|No&gt; to the Srcsafe.ini file. If this is
   not set, it is assumed to be Yes. This indicates whether the following
   text should be displayed as the first line of the template:
<P>
<P><PRE>      "Enter a comment for &lt;File Name&gt;; then save and exit."
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      For example:
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      Comment_Template= f:\vss\prompt.txt
      Comment_Editor=f:\windows\notepad.exe
      Comment_Editor_Prompt=Yes
</PRE><P>
</OL><h3>General Notes for Either Configuration</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>The string 'Enter a comment for &lt;File Name&gt;; then save and exit.' will
   not be saved along with the comment. Any text in the Comment Template
   will be saved.

<P><LI>If you want it to apply to all developers, these settings can be in the
   SrcSafe.ini. If you want it to apply to a specific developer, they
   should be in the SS.ini file. In addition, these settings can apply to
   all projects by putting them in the INI file before all section headers,
   [ ], or apply to just one project by putting them after a section
   header.
<P>
   [$/MyProject]
   Comment_Template= f:\vss\prompt.txt
   Comment_Editor=f:\windows\notepad.exe
   Comment_Editor_Prompt=Yes

<P><LI>If there has been no change to the file and the Update_No_Change INI
   setting is set to 'Uncheckout', it will not prompt you for a comment.

<P><LI>Adding, 'Checkout_Comment= -' to the INI file can be used to prevent
   SourceSafe from prompting for a comment when a user checks out a file.
   See the help file for more information on this setting.
