<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When files are added to Visual SourceSafe, the file names are "mangled" and
placed into the database. There is no documentation on how SourceSafe knows
to place files in the appropriate data sub-directory.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
SourceSafe translates all files and projects into a corresponding
"internal" file number. The name of the file, TBAAAAAA for instance,
represents the actual file number.
<P>
<P><h3>How to Find File Number</h3>
 
<P>
SourceSafe uses base-26 math (left to right) to get the file number. The
letter maps to a number where A=0 and Z=25. Take the actual file name and
break the letters down to a series of multiples using the base of 26. For
example, the file number for TBAAAAAA may be found by:
<P>
<PRE>   T = 19 * 26^0 = 19
   B = 1  * 26^1 = 26
   A = 0  * 26^2 =  0
   A = 0  * 26^3 =  0
   A = 0  * 26^4 =  0
   A = 0  * 26^5 =  0
   A = 0  * 26^6 =  0
   A = 0  * 26^7 =  0
           TOTAL = 45

</PRE>Therefore, the file number of TBAAAAAA is 45. By using a file number rather
than a name, SourceSafe gains several advantages:

<UL><LI>SourceSafe can store long filenames on 16-bit systems. Using the
   NAMES.DAT file, SourceSafe can take the long name and store it while
   a short name is generated for 16-bit platforms.

<LI>SourceSafe can distribute files among the data subdirectories equally.
   This prevents scenarios where, for example, the Z subdirectory holds
   0% of the database files and the M directory holds 23% of the database
   files.

<LI>Hashing the filename adds to the security of the system by making the
   DATA directory a black box to users.

<LI>SourceSafe can handle cross-platform naming conventions. On UNIX,
   SourceSafe and SOURCESAFE are two different files, and on NT these are
   the same file. Hashing the name allows SourceSafe to store the file
   case independently of the server operating system.
<P>
</UL><h3>How SourceSafe Finds Next File</h3>
 
<P>
In the DATA directory, there is a text file called AAAAAAAA.CNT. The
contents of this file consist of the last filename that was added in the
database. When a new project or file is added, SourceSafe opens this file
and adds one (1) to the file number. This new file is then generated in the
SourceSafe database. It is possible to put something like ZZZZZAAA in the
AAAAAAAAA.CNT file. SourceSafe will add 1 to this file number and write the
new file in the database. If a user is unaware of this and continues to use
SourceSafe and add files or projects, ANALYZE may not be able to run and
the database will not be able to be repaired. Because all read/write users
need read/write access to this file, a malicious user can cause some
serious database problems that may not be detected until it is too late.
<P>
<P><h3>If AAAAAAAA.CNT is Set Incorrectly</h3>
 
<P>
If the file in AAAAAAAA.CNT is incorrect, then SourceSafe will try the next
file number until it is able to create the new file. Obviously, SourceSafe
will be much slower when creating files or projects but there will be no
data loss. If the file is missing for some reason, create a new
AAAAAAAA.CNT file and put AAAAAAAA as the only text in the file. SourceSafe
will start writing files in the first available open file number.
