The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multi-user skills.
<P>
When you run the Switchboard Manager to create a switchboard form in a
database that is under source code control, you may receive the following
error message:
<P>
<PRE>   The Save action was canceled.

</PRE>The Switchboard form and table are created, but the Switchboard Manager
Wizard does not run to completion, and the Switchboard form is blank.
<P>
This article assumes that you are familiar with using the client-side
capabilities of Visual SourceSafe. For more information about Visual
SourceSafe, please refer to the "Visual SourceSafe User's Guide" or
Help topics available from the Visual SourceSafe Help menu.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Switchboard form was saved and closed in order to place it under
source code control, but this action occurred before the Switchboard
Manager Wizard had finished walking you through the design of the form.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
When you run the Switchboard Manager, the "Add Objects to SourceSafe"
dialog box appears, prompting you to add the new form to source code
control. Click Cancel in the dialog box, and finish running the Switchboard
Manager. Then manually add the form to SourceSafe by pointing to SourceSafe
on the Tools menu, and then clicking "Add Objects to SourceSafe."
<P>
NOTE: You must have Data and Misc. Objects checked out when you create a
Switchboard form with the Switchboard Manager Wizard. Because the Wizard
creates a Switchboard Items table, if you do not have Data and Misc.
Objects checked out, your Switchboard information will be lost. Any time
you use the Switchboard Manager to modify an existing Switchboard form,
you must check out both Data and Misc. Objects and the Switchboard form,
or your changes will be lost.

<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, point to Add-Ins, and then click Switchboard Manager.

<P><LI>When the manager prompts you to create a new switchboard, click Yes.

<P><LI>When SourceSafe prompts you to add the Switchboard form to SourceSafe,
   click OK.

<P><LI>When prompted if you want Microsoft Access to close the Switchboard
   form, click Yes. Note that you receive the message:
<P>
<P><PRE>      The Save action was canceled.
