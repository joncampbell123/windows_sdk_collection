The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 32-bit, for Windows, versions 4.0,
   4.0a, 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Visual SourceSafe DATA directory is not complex, but some explanation
of its structure may be needed. This article describes the file/directory
structure of the DATA directory and provides an overview of each
directory's use.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
SourceSafe will create 26 subdirectories in the DATA directory named
"A" through "Z." In addition, you may have up to three additional
directories named BACKUP, LOCKS, and LOGGEDIN (version 5.0 only).
SourceSafe will never create more than 29 sub-directories in the data
directory (28 in version 4.x).
<P>
Each file or project added to SourceSafe will have two files associated
with it in the database (called a file pair). By design, the root project
($/) is stored in the file pair AAAAAAAA and AAAAAAA.A. The first file or
project added to an empty database will be stored in the "B" directory and
will be named BAAAAAAA and BAAAAAAA.A. The file with an extension (the
data file) is a byte-for-byte copy of the most recently checked-in version
of the file or project. The other (known as the log file) contains the
history of the file as well as other information such as the name of its
parent project, etc.
<P>
Each time you modify a file in SourceSafe (through a Check-in, Label,
Branch, Merge, etc.), SourceSafe adds these changes to the log file and
then rewrites the data file to keep it current. On an Intel Machine, each
time the data file is rewritten, its extension will change from .A to .B,
or vice versa. For example, if MYFILE.TXT is being stored in the file pair
BAAAAAAA and BAAAAAAA.A, checking out MYFILE.TXT, modifying it and checking
it back in again will result in BAAAAAAA and BAAAAAAA.B (BAAAAAAA.A will be
deleted). Repeating the above procedure will again result in BAAAAAAA and
BAAAAAAA.A. If you are using a Macintosh client, there may be an additional
file with an extension of .C or .D. If you are using a UNIX box, you may
have an additional file with an extension of .E or .F. If you have a .C  or
.E file, you should also have a .A file. If you have a .D or .F file, you
should also have a .B file.
<P>
SourceSafe sequentially distributes files to the directories labeled "A"
through "Z" as files are added to the database. For example, if the file
pair for "FILE1" is placed in "B," the file pair for FILE2 will be placed
in "C," the file pair for FILE3 will be placed "D," and so on. The file
pair for the 27th file added will go back to "A" because it is the next
directory after "Z." Its name will be ABAAAAAA.A. As files are added to the
"A" directory, they will be named ACAAAAAA.A, ADAAAAAA.A, AEAAAAAA.A, and
so on. The first letter of these file names will be the same as the
directory in which they reside.
<P>
The BACKUP directory is created by ANALYZE.EXE when it is executed against
the database. If ANALYZE is run with the -f switch, this directory will
contain a backup copy of each file that was modified by ANALYZE. Anytime
ANALYZE is executed, a log file (ANALYZE.LOG) that contains information on
potential problems encountered by ANALYZE will be placed in this directory.
<P>
The LOGGEDIN directory is used by SourceSafe (version 5.0 only) to keep
track temporarily of who is logged into the database.
<P>
The LOCKS directory may be used to keep track of temporarily-locked files.
This feature is enabled when the LOCK_MODE = LOCKFILES setting is placed in
the server's SRCSAFE.INI.
