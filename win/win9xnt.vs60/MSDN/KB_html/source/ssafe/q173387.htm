The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 32-bit, for Windows, version 5.0
   on the following platforms:
   - Windows NT
   - Windows 95
   - x86
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After you have archived an entire database with the SSARC utility and you
try to restore it with SSRESTOR, you receive the following error:
<P>
<PRE>   The path $/ is already in use. Cannot restore path from archive file.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The syntax you used was:
<P>
<PRE>   SSRESTOR [-s path to srcsafe.ini] &lt;archive file&gt; $/

</PRE>SSRESTOR attempts to create a new project in the target database, with the
name of the project given in the SSRESTOR command. Because the root project
($/) will always exist in the target database, the restored root project
cannot be created.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 

<OL><P><LI>Repeat the SSRESTOR command multiple times, once for each top-level
   project.
<P>
   -or-

<P><LI>In the original project, share the entire project tree to a new project,
   and then archive and restore this project.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design. According to the User's Guide (Appendix B page
219 for Visual SourceSafe 5.0), "if restoring attempts to create a
duplicate file or project name, the restore fails."
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If, for example you have three top-level projects:
<P>
<PRE>   $/first
   $/second
   $/third

</PRE></OL><h3>Resolution 1</h3>
 
<P>
Run SSRESTOR three times, each time specifying the name of one of the
projects as the last argument (for example, SSRESTOR archive.ssa $/first).
There are two disadvantages to this method.
<P>
If there is a large number of top-level projects, this process will be
tedious, and there is no easy way to automate it. Any links (shared or
branched files) between top-level projects and will be lost. For example,
if:
<P>
<PRE>   $/first/sub_one/myfile.txt

</PRE>is shared to:
<P>
<PRE>   $/third/sub_one/myfile.txt

</PRE>the files will not be shared in the restored projects.
<P>
Links that are within the same project tree are maintained, such as:
<P>
<PRE>   $/first/sub_one/myfile.txt
   $/first/sub_five/myfile.txt

</PRE><h3>Resolution 2</h3>
 
<P>
There are three steps in this resolution:

<OL><P><LI>In the original database, create a new top-level project, (for example,
   $/root), then recursively share all top-level projects into $/root.

<P><LI> Archive $/root.

<P><LI> Restore $/root into the target database.
<P>
</OL>In this case all links at all levels are restored, the disadvantages of
this method are:

<UL><LI>With a large number of top-level projects, sharing them into $/root may
   be time consuming.

<LI>After restoring, you may want to move all the top-level projects back to
   being subprojects of $/, rather than subprojects of $/root. Again, this
   may be time consuming with a large number of projects.
