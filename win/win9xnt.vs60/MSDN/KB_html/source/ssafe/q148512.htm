<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, versions 4.0, 4.0a, 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes two commands (Properties and About) that are new in
Visual SourceSafe 4.0. These commands are available only from the command
line. They provide useful information and can be used as debugging tools.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>About Command</h3>
 
<P>
The About command displays information about the version of SourceSafe that
you are currently using. It lists the same information as the About Box in
the Graphical Interface product. Output from the About command looks like
this:
<P>
<PRE>      G:\vss40svr\win32&gt;ss about
      Microsoft (R) SourceSafe Version 4.00
      Copyright (C) Microsoft Corp. 1994-1995. All rights reserved.
      Version 4.00 (Build 0822)

</PRE>The About command uses the switches -H, -I-, -O, -Y, and -?. For more
information about these switches, click "List of Commands and Options" in
Appendix A of Books Online.
<P>
<P><h3>Properties Command</h3>
 
<P>
The Properties command displays attributes about a file or a project. It
lists the name of a file, the path to a project, the size, the latest
version and date, and comments. This command gives additional information
for files: the file type, its size in bytes and lines, and the status of
the "Store only latest version" setting.
<P>
Use the following syntax to call the Properties command:
<P>
<PRE>    SS PROPERTIES &lt;SSafe Item&gt; [-B] [-F-] [-H] [-O] [-R] [-L] [-N]
    [-I-] [-Y]

</PRE>Switches are defined as follows:

<UL><LI>The -H, -O, -I-, -N and -Y options are documented in the "List of
   Commands and Options" in Appendix A of the Visual SourceSafe Books
   Online.

<LI>With the -R option, the properties of all the files in the project tree
   are displayed. -R is ignored if a file name or file mask is specified
   on the command line.

<LI>The -B switch is the same as the FileType switch. "-B" changes the file
   to binary type, whereas "-B-" changes the file to text type.

<LI>The -L option changes the "store latest version" setting. When you check
   a file in, you have the option of either storing the latest version of
   the file or recording the difference (delta) information. Call the "-L"
   option to store the latest version on check in or "-L-" to store delta
   information on check in.

<LI>With the -F- option, only the properties of a project are displayed, and
   none of the attributes of a file are displayed. Using the (-B) or (-L)
   switches will not have any effect because the -B, -B-, -L, and -L-
   options only operate when files are displayed.
<P>
</UL>When the Properties command is passed the -B or -L switches, the property
is first changed, and then the report is displayed with the modified
information.
<P>
The output from the Properties command for a file looks like this:
<P>
<PRE>   G:\vss40svr\win32&gt;ss properties skel.c

   File:  $/cclass/SKEL.C
   Type:  Text
   Size:  948 bytes      18 lines
   Store only latest version:  No
   Latest:
    Version:  1
    Date:     8/03/95    3:56p
    Comment: Test project

</PRE>The output from the command line for a project looks like this:
<P>
<PRE>   G:\vss40svr\win32&gt;ss properties $/cclass

   Project:  $/CCLASS
   Contains:
     103 Files
     0 Subproject(s)
   Latest:
    Version:  104
    Date:     8/03/95    3:57p
   Comment: Test project
