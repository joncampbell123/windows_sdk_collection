The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows 95, versions 7.0, 7.0a
<LI>Microsoft Word for the Macintosh, versions 6.0, 6.0.1, 6.0.1a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Word does not retain changes that you make to the Envelope
Address or Envelope Return attributes.
<P>
This behavior occurs when you do either of the following:

<UL><LI>Use the Style command on the Format menu, and then select the Add To
   Template option to make the change permanent. (When you do this, some
   but not all of the style attributes are retained).
<P>
<P><PRE>      NOTE: See the "More Information" section of this article for a list
      of which attributes are lost.
</PRE>
<LI>Click Envelopes And Labels on the Tools menu and then click Options.
   These changes are valid only for the current envelope, and none of the
   changes are retained for future envelopes.
<P>
   NOTE: This second symptom occurs because of the way Microsoft Word is
   designed. To make the changes permanent, follow step 8-13 in "Method 1"
   in the "Workaround" section of this article.
<P>
</UL><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, use any of the following methods.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1</h3>
 
<P>
This method retains all font attributes and the position on page (from
left, from top). However, you can't use this method to set language
formatting, numbering, bullets, borders, or frame attributes other than
position on envelope. (You can use a combination of this method and the
"Format Style" method described in the "More Information" section at the
end of this article to achieve most of the formatting you need.)
<P>
To change most of the Envelope Address or Envelope Return style attributes
for the current and future envelopes, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Envelopes And Labels.

<P><LI>Select the Envelopes tab.

<P><LI>Click Options.

<P><LI>Adjust the position of the return address and the delivery address
    using the From Left and From Top options.

<P><LI>Adjust the font and point size by choosing the Font buttons, making the
    changes you want, and then clicking OK.

<P><LI>Click OK to return to the Envelope dialog box.

<P><LI>Click Add To Document.
<P>
    NOTE: Steps 1 through 7 change the envelope settings for the
    current envelope only. To make this change the default
    envelope setting for future envelopes, continue with the
    following steps.

<P><LI>On the Format menu, click Style.

<P><LI>Click Organizer.

<P><LI>The window on the left shows the styles for the current document. The
    window on the right shows the styles available in Normal.dot (or the
    desired template). If it does not, choose Normal.dot (or the desired
    template) from the Styles Available In list.

<P><LI>Select the Envelope Address style from the current document (left
    Window) and click Copy. Click Yes when Word asks if you want to replace
    the current style.

<P><LI>Select the Envelope Return style from the current document (left
    Window) and click Copy. Click Yes when Word asks if you want to replace
    the current style.

<P><LI>Click Close.
<P>
</OL>You can close the document without saving changes. The changes will remain
permanent for future envelopes.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 2: Create a Custom Envelope Template</h3>
 
<P>
Create a custom envelope template by formatting a document with a custom
paper size. For example, click Page Setup on the File menu (or the Format
menu depending on your version of Word), click the Paper Size tab, and set
Paper Size to Envelope #10).
<P>
<P><h3>Method 3: Use a Macro</h3>
 
<P>
Create a macro to modify the formatting once the envelope is added to a
document.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Changing the Envelope Address or Envelope Return style by choosing Style
from the Format menu does not work as expected. However, this method
successfully changes some attributes. Below is an outline of the procedure
and a section that describes which attributes are and are not retained.
<P>
<P><h3>Format Style Method</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>On the Format menu, click Style.

<P><LI>In the Styles list, click the Envelope Address or Envelope Return
   style.

<P><LI>Click Modify.

<P><LI>Click to select the Add To Template check box to add the style change to
   the template.

<P><LI>Click Format.

<P><LI>Click the style attribute you want to change.

<P><LI>Click OK to return to the Modify Style dialog box.

<P><LI>Click Close.
<P>
</OL>The style has now been modified. The changes will remain permanent for
future envelopes, with the exception of certain attributes. Below is a list
of the style attributes that are and are not retained when you use the
"Format Style Method."
<P>

                         remains "Bottom relative to Margin" regardless of
                         the style unless you type in a numeric value for
                         the vertical position. All other frame style
                         attributes are retained.
