<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Large documents that contain a contiguous range of paragraphs that are
formatted with any type of paragraph numbering, scroll slowly in Word. Line
numbering also affects the speed of scrolling through the document;
however, the impact is not as great as with paragraph numbering.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Because Word automatically updates numbers in a list, Word begins its count
at the first number in the list and continues to the number that appears at
the top or bottom of the screen, depending on the direction you are
scrolling. The rate of speed at which the scrolling becomes slower varies
with each system; however, contiguous ranges of approximately 100 numbered
paragraphs generally mark the point at which the speed begins to gradually
slow down.
<P>
This problem occurs with paragraphs formatted by choosing Bullets And
Numbering from the Format menu as well as the Numbering button on the
Toolbar, regardless of the numbering type (that is, multi-level, arabic
numbers, roman numerals, or alphabetic formats).
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
If the numbering is not contiguous or is interrupted, scrolling speed
returns until approximately 100 numbered paragraphs appear, at which time
the scrolling speed begins to gradually slow down. To interrupt numbering,
choose Stop Numbering from the shortcut menu.
<P>
NOTE: In Microsoft Word 6.x and 7.x, you cannot use this workaround if your 
paragraphs are formatted with heading levels, because you cannot apply the 
Stop Numbering property to heading level paragraphs.
