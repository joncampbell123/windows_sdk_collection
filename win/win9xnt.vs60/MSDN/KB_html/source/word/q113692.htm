The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows NT, version 6.0

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In a Word document that contains a Next Page section break followed by an
Index, when you update the Index, the Index may move to the previous page.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Word changes the section break immediately above the Index to a Continuous
section break when you update the Index.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
Use one of the following methods.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1: Use Two Next Page Section Breaks</h3>
 
<P>
When you insert the Next Page section break to force your Index to a new
page, insert two Next Page section breaks instead, and then insert your
Index. This will initially cause you to have a blank page between your
document and the Index. However, when you update the Index, the Next Page
section break immediately above the Index will change to a Continuous
section break, and the blank page will disappear.
<P>
See the "More Information" section of this article for additional details
using this method.
<P>
NOTE: Do not delete any of the section breaks immediately above the Index
after you update the index.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 2: Change the section break above the Index to New Page</h3>
 
<P>
After you update your Index, place the insertion point on the section break
immediately above the Index. On the File menu, click Page Setup. On the
Layout tab, change the Section Start box to New Page, and then click OK.
<P>
NOTE: If you later update the Index again, you may need to repeat this
method to return the section break to a New Page section break.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 3: Use the RD Field</h3>
 
<P>
Create your index in a separate document using the RD field.
<P>
For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../word/q127249.htm">Q127249</A></B>
   TITLE     : XD1033: How to Create a Table of Contents in Word

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in
Microsoft Word 97 for Windows and Microsoft Word 98 Macintosh Edition.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In a Word document, you insert a Next Page section break to force the next
page of the document to a new page. You may want to do this at the end of
your document so your Index will appear on a separate page from the rest of
the document.
<P>
<P><h3>What Happens When You Insert Your Index</h3>
 
<P>
When you insert the Index, Word places a Next Page section break above the
Index and a Continuous section break below the Index. When you view your
document in Normal view, your text should appear similar to the following:
<P>
<P>
<PRE>     This is sample text this is sample text this is sampl
     text this is sample text this is sample text this is
     sample text this is sample text this is sample text t
     is sample text this is sample text this is sample tex
     ====================End of Section=================== &lt;-- See Note 1
     ====================End of Section=================== &lt;-- See Note 2

                   Your Index would appear here

     ====================End of Section=================== &lt;-- See Note 3


     NOTE 1: This is the Next Page section break you inserted into your
     document to force the Index to a new page.

     NOTE 2: This is a Next Page section break that Word automatically
     placed when you inserted your Index.

     NOTE 3: This is a Continuous section break that Word automatically
     placed when you inserted your Index.

</PRE>Even though there are two Next Page section breaks above the Index, there
will not be a blank page between the Index and the rest of your document.
Do not delete either of these section breaks.
<P>
<P><h3>What Happens When You Update Your Index</h3>
 
<P>
When you update your Index, Word changes the section break immediately
above the Index to a Continuous section break, similar to the following:
<P>
<P>
<PRE>     This is sample text this is sample text this is sampl
     text this is sample text this is sample text this is
     sample text this is sample text this is sample text t
     is sample text this is sample text this is sample tex
     ====================End of Section=================== &lt;-- See Note 4
     ====================End of Section=================== &lt;-- See Note 5

                   Your Index would appear here

     ====================End of Section=================== &lt;-- See Note 6

     NOTE 4: This is the Next Page section break you inserted into your
     document to force the Index to a new page.

     NOTE 5: This was a Next Page section break that Word automatically
     placed when you inserted your Index, but when you update the Index,
     this section break is changed to a Continuous section break.

     NOTE 6: This is a Continuous section break that Word automatically
     placed when you inserted your Index.

</PRE>Since the section break immediately above the Index has been changed to a
Continuous section break, the Index will now appear on the previous page.
Word ignores the first section break (New Page).
<P>
<P><h3>What Happens When You Use Method 1 Workaround</h3>
 
<P>
After you use method 1 to workaround this problem, your text will look
similar to the following:
<P>
<PRE>     This is sample text this is sample text this is sampl
     text this is sample text this is sample text this is
     sample text this is sample text this is sample text t
     is sample text this is sample text this is sample tex
     ====================End of Section=================== &lt;-- See Note 7
     ====================End of Section=================== &lt;-- See Note 8
     ====================End of Section=================== &lt;-- See Note 9

                   Your Index would appear here

     ====================End of Section=================== &lt;-- See Note 10

     NOTE 7: This is the Next Page section break you inserted into your
     document to force the Index to a new page.

     NOTE 8: This is the second Next Page section break you inserted when
     you use Method 2 to workaround this problem.

     NOTE 9: This was a Next Page section break that Word automatically
     placed when you inserted your Index, but when you update the Index,
     this section break is changed to a Continuous section break.

     NOTE 10: This is a Continuous section break that Word automatically
     placed when you inserted your Index.

</PRE>Keys Points To Remember Using This Workaround:

<UL><LI>Initially, a blank page will appear between the Index and the rest of
   your document. However, this blank page will disappear when you update
   the Index.

<LI>When you update the Index, the section break immediately above the Index
   is changed to a Continuous section break.

<LI>The second section break (New Page) is ignored by Word.

<LI>The first section break (New Page) forces your Index to a new page.

<LI>Do not delete any of these section breaks.
