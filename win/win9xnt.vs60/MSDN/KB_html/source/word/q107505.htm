The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, version 6.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you try to change an entry in the File Locations dialog box to a
network drive (using the universal naming convention [UNC]), you may get
one of the following error messages if that network requires a password:
<P>
<PRE>   Error Message                   Operating System
   -------------                   ----------------

   The path is not valid.          Windows 3.1
   The directory is not valid.     Windows for Workgroups 3.1

</PRE>(To locate the File Locations dialog box, choose Options from the Tools
menu, and select the File Locations tab.)
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The error messages are initiated from from Windows error messaging and does
not contain password information.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
You must connect to the server and assign it a drive letter. In Workgroups,
you need do this only once.
<P>
<P><h2>Windows 3.1</h2>
 
<P>
Use File Manager to connect to the network drive so that the server is
associated with a drive letter. Use this drive letter when specifying the
location of the files.
<P>
<P><h2>Windows for Workgroups</h2>
 

<OL><P><LI>From the File menu, choose Open.

<P><LI>Type the UNC name of the server you want to connect to. Choose OK.

<P><LI>When prompted, type the password in the password box. Choose OK.

<P><LI>In the File Locations tab, choose Modify. Type the UNC name of the
   server. Choose OK.

<P><LI>Choose Close.
<P>
</OL><h2>Windows 3.1 and Windows for Workgroups 3.1</h2>
 

<OL><P><LI>From the Tools menu, choose Options. Select the File Locations tab, and
   choose Modify.

<P><LI>Choose Network. The Network Location dialog box used by File Manager is
   displayed.

<P><LI>Select a drive letter and type the path name. Select the appropriate
   directory and choose OK.
<P>
</OL>Word shows the option and the UNC name of the server to which it is
connected.
<P>
If you are using Workgroups, Word will remember the UNC name of the
server.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If you are using Windows for Workgroups, and have ever connected to the
server in question, you will not see this error message in Word. Windows
for Workgroups saves passwords in a *.PWL file, whose location is specified
by the [Password Lists] section of the SYSTEM.INI.
<P>
In Windows for Workgroups, if you try to access files by specifying a UNC
path in the File Open dialog box and the server you are accessing requires
you to supply a password, Word will ask you for the password. Word won't
ask you for the password in the future. It will assign a drive letter to
the server when you first choose Open from the File menu but won't assign
one in the future.
