The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The following information was taken from the Word 98 Macintosh Edition
online Help.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
For your convenience, we've assembled these lists of key features in Word
98, along with ideas about how you might apply them to your work.
<P>
<P><h3>What's New With Creating Memos, Reports, and Other Documents?</h3>
 
<P>
You can use a template or wizard to save time in creating many common types
of documents. For example, you can use the Memo Wizard to easily create
professional-looking memos or the Web Page Wizard to get a head start on
Web pages.
<P>
Some wizards and templates are installed through the Easy Installer, some
can be installed through the Custom Installer, and some are available in
the Office 98 Value Pack on CD-ROM.
<P>
Here are some of the documents you can create using wizards and templates:

<UL><LI>Agendas
<LI>Brochures
<LI>Calendars
<LI>Directories
<LI>Faxes
<LI>Invoices
<LI>Legal pleadings
<LI>Letters
<LI>Manuals
<LI>Memos
<LI>Newsletters
<LI>Purchase orders
<LI>Reports
<LI>Resumes
<LI>Theses
<LI>Time sheets
<LI>Web pages
<P>
</UL>Once you've verified that the wizard or template you want is installed,
click New on the File menu, click the tab for the type of document you
want, and then double-click the template or wizard.
<P>
<P><h3>What's New With Editing and Proofing Tools?</h3>
 
<P>
Word 98 provides the following key features that make it faster and easier
to proofread and edit documents.
<P>
Check spelling as you type
<P>
<PRE>   Checks for spelling errors as you type, and marks possible errors
   directly in your document.

</PRE>Check grammar as you type
<P>
<PRE>   Checks for grammar errors as you type, and marks possible errors
   directly in your document. Like the automatic spelling checker, the
   automatic grammar checker offers suggestions for corrections in-place
   when you hold down CONTROL and click the marked text.

</PRE>Smart spelling
<P>
<PRE>   - Recognizes your name, your organization's name, personal names of
     varying ethnicity, commonly used company names from the Fortune 1000
     list, all country names, names of most U.S. cities with a population
     of 30,000 or more, and current terminology.

   - Recognizes your typing patterns and does not mark certain patterns as
     errors in your document -- for example, words in uppercase letters and
     words containing numbers are no longer marked as misspellings.

   - Ignores Internet addresses.

</PRE>Natural-language grammar checker
<P>
<PRE>   Flags mistakes accurately, gives you in-place, effective suggestions,
   and reduces your proofing time. It offers improved syntactic analysis,
   better rewrite suggestions, and more user-friendly grammar styles.

</PRE>Spelling and grammar checking combination
<P>
<PRE>   Eliminates separate dialog boxes and provides an interface that lets you
   proofread online exactly as you do on paper. You can now check your
   spelling and grammar mistakes in one pass, in one place.

</PRE>Find (and replace) all word forms
<P>
<PRE>   Finds and replaces all grammatically inflected forms of a word. For
   example, if you want to replace the word "saw" with the word "hammer"
   throughout a document, Word intelligently changes not only "saw" to
   "hammer," but also "sawing" to "hammering" and "sawed" to "hammered."
   Word can also intelligently replace the right word forms; in this
   example, Word does not replace the verb "seen" with "hammer" even though
   seen is a word form of "saw" -- that's because "seen" is unrelated to
   "hammer." In addition, Word 98 provides alternative word forms, giving
   you choices for possible replacements in case the default choice is not
   ideal. You can select the replacement from a list rather than having to
   type it.

</PRE>Thesaurus
<P>
<PRE>   Hold down CONTROL and click on a word to see a list of synonyms from the
   thesaurus.

</PRE><h3>What's New with Automating Your Tasks and Getting Assistance?</h3>
 
<P>
Word 98 provides an extensive set of automatic features that make everyday
tasks easier.
<P>
AutoCorrect
<P>
<PRE>   Word can correct the following errors automatically while you type:

   - Plural and possessive forms of a word. For example, if you have
     an AutoCorrect entry that inserts Sweet Lil whenever you type
     SL, Word also automatically changes SL's to Sweet Lil's.

   - Common multiple word spelling errors. For example, Word replaces
     int he with in the.

   - Common word pairs that are spelled correctly but are grammatically
     incorrect when used together. For example, Word replaces your a with
     you're a.

</PRE>AutoFormat As You Type
<P>
<PRE>   Word can format text automatically as you type.

   - Word creates numbered and bulleted lists when you start a list with a
     number or an asterisk.

   - Word creates a single or double border for you when you type three or
     more consecutive hyphens (-) or equal signs (=) in a row and then
     press RETURN.

   - Word applies built-in heading styles to text, such as Heading 1, when
     you type a line of text with no ending punctuation and then press
     RETURN twice.

   - Word formats ordinal numbers, such as changing 1st to 1st (with the st
     superscripted).

   - Word formats Internet paths -- such as <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/">http://www.microsoft.com/</A></B> -- as
     hyperlinks. When you click an Internet hyperlink, Word starts your Web
     browser and takes you to the specified Web page.

   - Word automates the lead-in emphasis -- that is, detects the formatting
     applied in the first list item and applies it to the next item. For
     example:

        1.  Word 98 is smart! It does the work for you.
        2.  Word 98 is cool! It makes your document look amazing.

   - Word translates common typing patterns to richer formatting -- for
     example, Word changes *Bold* to Bold and _Italic_ to Italic.

   - When you type +----+----+, Word creates a table with a column for
     each pair of + signs.

   - Word detects leading spaces that correspond to the left margin of
     the bulleted or numbered paragraph above and changes your left
     indentation for you.

</PRE>AutoComplete
<P>
<PRE>   Word can automatically offer suggestions for the rest of the word or
   phrase you are typing. To accept the suggestion, press RETURN
   and then Word automatically replaces your partially typed word with
   the completed word. Word 98 will automatically complete:

   - The current date
   - A day of the week
   - A month other than the current one
   - Your name and company name
   - AutoText entries

</PRE>AutoSummarize
<P>
<PRE>   You can use the Word AutoSummarize feature to automatically summarize
   the key points in a document. Word analyzes your document statistically
   and linguistically to determine the most important sentences and gives
   you a custom summary based on this analysis. With AutoSummarize, you can
   highlight the key points in an online document and view it at different
   levels of detail. Or you can automatically create a separate summary or
   abstract. You have total control of the length of the summary.

   It's important that you comply with all applicable copyright laws when
   using this feature. You should review the accuracy of any summary
   because it is, by its nature, not the entirety of the work.

</PRE>Automatic style creation and style preview
<P>
<PRE>   Words 98 includes the following style improvements:

   - It automatically creates a style for you when you apply new formatting
     to your text.

   - It can automatically redefine styles to reflect your recently applied
     changes.

   - It gives you an instant preview of each style from the Style box on
     the Formatting toolbar.

</PRE>Letter Wizard
<P>
<PRE>   The Letter Wizard in Word 98 can help you write a new letter quickly and
   easily, or it can help you change and add to elements in your existing
   letter. It includes:

   - Letter Wizard dialog box. Accessible from the Tools menu, this dialog
     box provides letter element choices you can make to easily build your
     letter. If you've already started a letter, this dialog box displays
     the appropriate information from your letter, so you can get an
     instant snapshot of what you have and what you need. In addition, Word
     remembers whom you've sent letters to and stores all related
     information, such as contact names, addresses, and titles, in a list.
     When you send a letter to a previous recipient, all you have to do is
     select that person's name from a list, and Word automatically fills in
     the rest of the information for you.

   - Step-by-step help through the Office Assistant. When you type in a
     common letter salutation, such as "Dear Joe," Word recognizes it as a
     letter salutation and immediately offers to step you through the
     letter creation process using the Office Assistant. The Office
     Assistant is fully integrated with the Letter Wizard dialog box and
     provides hints and details on all the letter elements.

   - Easy text reuse. Once you use the Letter Wizard, Word automatically
     adds structure and styles to your letter by converting letter elements
     into AutoText List fields. For example, the closing text "Sincerely"
     is converted to a Closing field. When you hold down CONTROL and click
     the word "Sincerely," a menu appears that offers alternative closings,
     such as "Best regards" and "Cordially." You can easily replace
     "Sincerely" with any of these closings just by clicking the closing of
     your choice.

</PRE>Office Assistant
<P>
<PRE>   The Office Assistant uses IntelliSense natural-language technology. The
   Assistant anticipates the kind of help you need and suggests Help topics
   based on the work you're doing. You can also type a Help request in your
   own words and get the answer you need. You can have the Assistant offer
   to start a wizard when you begin certain tasks, such as creating a
   letter. The new Office Assistant character in Word 98 is a central place
   for you to get tips on how to use Word features more efficiently and
   find visual examples and step-by-step instructions for specific tasks.

</PRE><h3>What's New With Toolbars and Menus?</h3>
 
<P>
If you upgraded to Microsoft Word 98 Macintosh Edition from Microsoft Word
for the Macintosh 5.1, there may be times when you would like to work in a
more familiar environment. By enabling the Word 5.1 interface in Word 98,
you can work with Word 5.1 menus and toolbars and still use all the new
functionality of Word 98. When you enable the Word 5.1 interface, the
following changes occur:

<UL><LI>Word 98 displays the Word 5.1 toolbar.

<LI>The Word 5.1 ribbon toolbar and ruler are available on the View menu.

<LI>Word 98 rearranges menu commands to more closely correspond to the
   Word 5.1 menus.

<LI>Word 98 supports most Word 5.1 keyboard shortcuts.
<P>
</UL><h3>What's New With Tables, Borders, and Shading Tools?</h3>
 
<P>
Word 98 provides the following new features to make it faster and easier to
work with tables, borders, and shading.
<P>
Table tools
<P>
<PRE>   Draw Table tool

      Lets you create and customize tables. You use this intuitive drawing
      tool much the same way you use a pen to draw a table -- just click
      and drag to draw the table boundaries and cell partitions. You can
      now make individual cells any height and width you want.

   Eraser tool

      Lets you easily remove any cell, row, or column partition to achieve
      the same effect as merging two cells. In earlier versions of Word,
      you could only merge cells if they were in the same row. In Word 98,
      you can merge any adjacent cells -- vertically or horizontally.

   Vertical alignment

      Lets you align cell contents at the top, center, or bottom of the
      cell, using the convenient alignment toolbar buttons. If your text is
      oriented vertically, the buttons automatically adjust to give you
      left, center, and right alignment.

   Vertical text direction

      Makes your text flow vertically (rotated 90 degrees) in table cells,
      text boxes, and frames. This is a useful feature for creating labels
      and also for publishing oriented documents where credits or
      copyrights are printed sideways.

   In-table row resizer

      Lets you adjust any row's height directly in your table by dragging
      the row border up or down, just as you adjust column widths. If you
      hold down OPTION while you drag, the new vertical ruler shows you the
      exact row height.

</PRE>Border and shading tools
<P>
<PRE>   New border styles

      Gives you more than 150 border styles to customize the look of your
      documents. This includes 3-D styles and several publishing-oriented
      styles that allow multiple line borders, which are especially popular
      in professional documents.

   Page borders

      Lets you put a border around each page. Word Provides 150 new border
      line styles. Page borders are also highly customizable. For example,
      you can have:

      - A unique border style for each page edge.
      - Headers and footers in the border area.
      - A different first page.

   Text borders

      Lets you apply borders to words or characters within a paragraph. You
      can literally "block out" pieces of text by applying any of the
      available border styles. Text borders also make it easier to put
      borders around headings.

   Text shading

      Lets you call out parts of your document for other users. Just as you
      apply shading to paragraphs, now you can apply it to selected words
      or characters within a paragraph. Choose any shading color or
      gradation.

</PRE><h3>What's New With Drawing Tools?</h3>
 
<P>
Word 98 provides a new set of drawing and graphics capabilities that you
can use to easily embellish your text and graphics with 3-D effects,
shadow effects, textured and transparent fills, and AutoShapes.
<P>
Office Art
<P>
<PRE>   Gives you many new drawing tools and capabilities that can be easily
   accessed through the new Drawing toolbar. You can easily embellish your
   text and graphics using the 100 adjustable AutoShapes, 4 types of fill
   effects -- multicolored gradient, textured, transparent, and picture --
   right-shadow effects, and 3-D effects. Office Art is a rich and
   sophisticated drawing layer that replaces the Word drawing layer and is
   shared by all Microsoft Office applications.

</PRE>Office Art picture objects
<P>
<PRE>   Gives you all the flexibility required for picture manipulation. For
   example:

   - You can easily place pictures anywhere in your document, including
     inline with text, simply by dragging them.

   - You can modify the z-order and use Send Behind Text to create a
     background graphic or watermark effect.

</PRE>Text boxes
<P>
<PRE>   Replaces frames and offers the full set of Office Art capabilities, such
   as 3-D effects, fills, backgrounds, rotation, sizing, and cropping.

</PRE>Linked text boxes
<P>
<PRE>   Gives you the ability to link text boxes for desktop publishing use --
   for example, you can flow an article from page 1 to page 4 in a
   newsletter. Once two text boxes are linked, text that overflows from the
   first text box appears at the top of the second one. Any number of text
   boxes can be linked in any direction.

</PRE>Wrapping around irregular objects
<P>
<PRE>   Lets you wrap text around objects of any shape and size. You can wrap
   text straight to the edge of an irregular object.

</PRE><h3>What's New with the Word Address Book?</h3>
 
<P>
Use the Word Address Book to include addresses on envelopes, labels, and
other documents. You can use the address book as your data source with Mail
Merge. To insert an address in the Envelopes and Labels dialog box, click
Insert Address  . Also, use the Word Address Book in wizards such as the
Letter Wizard.
<P>
<P><h3>What's New with Movies?</h3>
 
<P>
You can insert, play, and format QuickTime, MPEG, or Video for Windows
movies in your Word documents using the Movie command (Insert menu). Pick
which frame of your movie you would like to see while the movie is not
playing, and decide what size and shape you would like your movie to appear
in your Word document.
<P>
<P><h3>What's New with Web Tools?</h3>
 
<P>
Word 98 provides an extensive set of features that you can use to take
advantage of the World Wide Web and the Internet.
<P>
Active Web
<P>
<PRE>   You can use the Active Web--shared by all Microsoft Office programs--
   to author and browse through rich webs of documents on an intranet or on
   the Web.

   Hyperlinks

      Link to any Microsoft Office, HTML, or other file on any internal or
      external Web site. To jump to the new destinations, you simply click
      the hyperlinks. Word can automatically recognize and format e-mail
      addresses and URLs as hyperlinks.

   The Web toolbar

      Quickly open, search, and browse through any document, including Web
      documents or pages. You can jump from one document or site to
      another, jump forward or backward among the documents you've opened,
      and add interesting documents you find on the Web to the Favorites
      folder to quickly return to them later.

   Compressed graphics

      Compress pictures or graphics inserted in documents automatically.
      Word natively stores JPEG images and converts all raster formats to
      PNG, a new compressed format.

</PRE>Web page authoring
<P>
<PRE>   Web Page Wizard

      Start creating a Web page for you. The wizard provides customized Web
      templates that you can easily modify to meet your needs. You can
      choose from a variety of content templates that address the common
      types of Web pages, such as a sample personal home page. You can also
      choose predefined visual themes for these pages -- each theme
      contains fitting background colors, bullets, horizontal lines, and
      other elements.

   Sound

      Incorporate background sound seamlessly on Web pages if your Web
      browser supports it. You can specify the location of the sound file
      to be played and the number of times to play it.

   Video

      Choose a video clip to play, specify playback options -- such as "on
      open" or "on mouse-over" or both -- and, as in the case of sound,
      specify how often to play the clip. You can specify alternative
      images and text for browsers that don't support video.

   Pictures

      Add a picture to a Web page, just as you do with a Word document.

   Scrolling text

      Add scrolling text to your Web pages. Type in the text you want in
      this style, and you have full control over the animation type,
      direction, speed, background color, and size.

   Bullets

      Make your online Web pages graphically rich. Word provides a
      collection of colorful, graphical images that can be used as bullets
      on your Web pages.

   Horizontal lines

      Add HTML-specific horizontal lines that can be colorful and graphical
      additions to your Web pages. These lines are an extension of the
      built-in borders and shading functionality in Word.

   HTML forms

      Produce consistent results with both HTML and non-HTML forms. All
      interface elements are similar, except where they are extended for
      HTML-tag-specific controls.

   HTML tags

      Simplify authoring your Web pages. Word provides WYSIWYG ("what you
      see is what you get") support for authoring Web pages with commonly
      used tags, such as tables, fonts, and background sound. There are
      more than 80 HTML tags supported in Word.

</PRE><h3>What's New with Reading Online Documents?</h3>
 
<P>
Word 98 provides a rich set of new tools to enhance the way you read and
move through online documents.
<P>
Online layout view
<P>
<PRE>   Achieve the best screen appearance for your online documents. Text
   appears larger and wraps to fit the window.

</PRE>Document Map
<P>
<PRE>   Gain instant access to any part of your document. Word splits the window
   into two panes -- a Document Map in the left pane and the document
   content in the right pane. The heading-based outline of the document in
   the Document Map lets you quickly scan the document structure, gives you
   one-click access to the point of interest, and serves as a "You are
   here" road map by highlighting your current location in the document.

</PRE>Hyperlinks
<P>
<PRE>   Link to any Microsoft Office, HTML, or other file on any internal or
   external Web site. To jump to the new destinations, you simply click
   the hyperlinks. Word can automatically recognize and format e-mail
   addresses and URLs as hyperlinks.

</PRE>Hyperlinked cross-references
<P>
<PRE>   Create "live" cross-references in documents that others will read
   online by inserting the cross-references as hyperlinks. Instead of
   scrolling through the document to find the referenced text, now you can
   just click the cross-reference and use the Web navigational toolbar to
   jump back and forth between related paragraphs.

</PRE>Document background
<P>
<PRE>   Make your document more visually appealing to read online by adding
   background colors and textures. You can see these backgrounds only in
   online layout view, and you can't print them.

</PRE>Animated text
<P>
<PRE>   Add animated effects that make the text appear to move or flash.

</PRE>Navigation tools
<P>
<PRE>   Browse through a document directly from the scroll bar. The browser lets
   you choose an element to browse by -- for example, to review all the
   tables or pictures in a document, you click Browse by Table in the
   browser. You can use the browser to browse through a document by page,
   section, comment, footnote, endnote, field, table, graphic, heading, or
   editing change.

</PRE><h3>What's New with Collaboration with Others?</h3>
 
<P>
Word 98 offers new features that reflect the work style of teams and gives
you tools that increase efficiency and productivity.
<P>
Versioning
<P>
<PRE>   Maintain a working history of a document. With this feature you can see
   exactly who did what on a document and when. You can also enter
   descriptive text about the changes made in each version. All the
   versioning information is stored within the document, so you don't need
   to maintain and track multiple copies of the document. In addition, you
   can have Word automatically save a version each time you save and close
   the document, so you can see who changed what in each version.

</PRE>Merging documents
<P>
<PRE>   Consolidate all changes and comments from different reviewers in one
   document. Multiple reviewers can modify separate copies of the same
   document, and then you can merge all their changes into the original.
   Or, for example, you can take a document away overnight and
   automatically merge your changes back into the original document when
   you return.

</PRE>Comments and ScreenTips
<P>
<PRE>   Easily review someone else's comments online without opening a separate
   pane. You can see at a glance where comments were inserted, the affected
   text appears to be shaded with light yellow. When you rest the pointer
   over this text, a ScreenTip that includes the comment and the name of
   the reviewer appears above the text. You can now read each comment in
   context.

</PRE>Reviewing toolbar
<P>
<PRE>   Quickly gain access to all the common reviewing tools you need on one
   toolbar -- track and review changes, insert and review comments,

</PRE><h3>What's New with Multilingual Support?</h3>
 
<P>
Word 98 makes it easy to create and display documents that contain text in
a variety of Pan European languages. With automatic font and language
switching when the keyboard changes, you can have multilingual text in your
document and in several dialog boxes.
<P>
Switch the keyboard language and layout
<P>
<PRE>   Type text in multiple languages. Word can automatically switch fonts
   based on the language you are typing. Switching the keyboard layout and
   language also automatically marks the text as a particular language.
   Marking the language ensures that Spanish text, for example, is proofed
   only by the Spanish proofing tools.

</PRE>Use multilingual text in dialog boxes
<P>
<PRE>   Edit and display multilingual text in Word. For example, you can search
   by a German author's name in the Find File dialog box in Word.

</PRE>Open multilingual documents from localized versions of Word
<P>
<PRE>   Correctly display text created in localized versions of Word if you have
   the appropriate fonts on your system. For languages that use a different
   character set, such as Russian, you first must purchase and install
   software that supports that language. Note that this applies to all
   localized versions except bi-directional versions, such as Hebrew and
   Arabic.

</PRE>Sort by language
<P>
<PRE>   Specify a language on which to base the sorting order of text in your
   document. For example, a Hungarian double letter such as "cz" sorts
   correctly in U.S. Word when you set the sorting language to Hungarian.

</PRE>Insert symbols
<P>
<PRE>   Quickly insert special characters and accent marks by clicking Symbol
   (Insert menu). To insert characters from languages that use a different
   character set (for example, Russian or Japanese), you first must
   purchase and install software that supports that language.
