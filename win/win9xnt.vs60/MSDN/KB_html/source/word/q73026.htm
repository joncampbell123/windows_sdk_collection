<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a, 2.0, 2.0a,

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
It is possible to use the RecordNextCommand macro to record the
syntax of the next WordBasic command executed into an open macro window
in Microsoft Word.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The RecordNextCommand macro can be helpful when you are writing a macro and
are unsure of the syntax for a particular command. The RecordNextCommand
will insert the syntax of the next command executed into the open macro
window.
<P>
<P><h3>Word versions 6.0, 7.0</h3>
 
<P>
To activate the RecordNextCommand in Word for Windows 6.0 and 7.0, do the
following:

<OL><P><LI>In the Macro Editor, place your insertion point at the spot
   where you wish the recorded command to begin.

<P><LI>Switch to an open document window from the Window menu or by
   pressing Ctrl-F6), or open a new document.

<P><LI>From the Macro Editor toolbar, which is still showing above
   the Ruler, press the button second from left, a dot with a
   number "1" next to it. (If you're not sure which button, the
   Toolbar Hint will say "RecordNextCommand" when your mouse
   pointer is positioned on the button.)

<P><LI>Your mouse pointer will grow an icon resembling an audio
   cassette, to indicate that the Macro Recorder is active.

<P><LI>Perform the action that is to be recorded into your macro.
   (You may re-press the button to abort the recording.)

<P><LI>Once the command is completed, the recorder will place the
   command syntax into the macro window. Switch back to the open
   macro sheet to view the recorded syntax.
<P>
</OL>There is no pre-assigned shortcut key for RecordNextCommand in
Word for Windows version 6. For information about creating a
shortcut key or assigning RecordNextCommand to a menu or toolbar,
refer to pages 716-728 of the Microsoft Word for Windows version
6.0 User's Guide.
<P>

   Commands option button in the Show box. This selects all macro
   commands.

<P><LI>Select RecordNextCommand from the list of available macros and
   press ENTER. (Make sure that you have opened a macro menu at this
   point by selecting Macro from the Tools menu and giving your macro
   a name. Choose Edit to open a macro window).

appear in the macro window, and do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Switch to an open document window from the Window menu or open a
   document. (Make sure that you have a macro window open as well by
   choosing Edit from the Macro menu, giving a name to your macro, and
   then pressing ENTER.)

<P><LI>From the Macro menu, choose Run and press ALT+A to select the
   Show All check box (if not already selected).

<P><LI>Select RecordNextCommand from the list of available macros and
   press ENTER.

<P><LI>"REC" will now appear in the status bar at the bottom of the
   Word for Windows screen to indicate that the Macro Recorder is
   active.

<P><LI>Perform the command that is to be recorded into the macro sheet.
<P>
</OL>Once the command is completed, the recorder will place the command
syntax into the macro window. Switch back to the open macro sheet

using the Assign to Menu function (refer to page 195 of the "Microsoft
Word for Windows User's Reference" for more information on adding
