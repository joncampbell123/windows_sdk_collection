The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows 95, version 7.0
<LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Word for the Macintosh, version 6.0
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows NT, version 6.0

<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you are working over a network and you save a document in Word, the
following error message is displayed:
<P>
<PRE>   There has been a network or file permission error.
   The network connection may be lost. &lt;Filename.doc&gt;

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Case 1</h3>
 
<P>
This error message appears when the document is open on two or more
computers that are running different operating platforms. For example, if
the document is open on a Macintosh computer and you open it on a second
computer running Windows or Windows NT, the error occurs when either user
tries to save the document.
<P>
This problem stems from a difference between the ways Macintosh OLE and
Windows OLE open files. As a result, you cannot save a file on two
different operating platforms at the same time.
<P>
<P><h3>Case 2</h3>
 
<P>
On either Microsoft Windows NT or Windows 95, using Novell's clients, this
error may occur if the Always Create Backup copy option is set on the Save
tab of Options on the Tools menu. What Microsoft Word does with this
setting turned on is that when the file is saved, it attempts to create a
backup copy with the name of "Backup of &lt;filename&gt;". This violates the 8.3
naming convention and so the attempt to save the file will fail. According
to Microsoft this is currently hardcoded into Microsoft Word and cannot be
changed.
<P>
<P><h3>Case 3</h3>
 
<P>
This error will occur in Word 97 for Windows if saving to a MAPROOT
type network drive connection on a NetWare server where spaces exist
in the file name.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Case 4</h3>
 
<P>
This problem may occur if an anti-virus program on a network has the
ability to scan for macro viruses.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Case 1</h3>
 
<P>
Method 1:
<P>
Move the document to your local hard disk for editing. Move it back to the
server after you finish.
<P>
Method 2:
<P>
Save a copy of the file with a different file name, and work on the copy,
either on your hard disk or on the server.
<P>
<P><h3>Case 2</h3>
 
<P>
Method 1:
<P>
Turn off the Always Create Backup Copy option by:

<OL><P><LI>Click Options on the Tools Menu.

<P><LI>Click on the Save tab.

<P><LI>Click to deselect the option of Always Create Backup Copy.
<P>
</OL>Method 2:
<P>
Add long filename support to the server by adding OS/2 namespace. Contact
Novell for details on how to do this.
<P>
<P><h3>Case 3</h3>
 
<P>
Method 1:
<P>
Move the document to your local hard disk for editing. Move it back to the
server after you finish.
<P>
Method 2:
<P>
Do not use spaces in the directory or document names.
<P>
Method 3:
<P>
Do not use MAPROOT-drive connections. Map your drive connections to the
volume-level only.
<P>
<P><h3>Case 4</h3>
 
<P>
Try turning off the anti-virus protection that allows the document to be
saved. Contact your anti-virus protection software company for additional
details and/or updates to their programs.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Word versions 6.0, 6.0a,
and 6.0c for Windows and Word version 6.0 for the Macintosh, Word
version 7.0 for Windows 95, and Word 97. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
This problem was corrected in Word version 6.0.1 for the Macintosh.
