<P>
</UL><h3>Using the Optimum Scanning Resolution</h3>
 
<P>
Use the optimum scanning resolution to keep images from getting
unnecessarily large. Do this by matching the scanning resolution to the
capacity of the output device. If an image has more resolution than a
printer can print, the printer simply ignores the excess. The best scanning
resolution is equal to two times the number of lines per inch (lpi) of the
printer. The following table will help you select the optimum scanning
resolution.
<P>
<PRE>   Output device     Output dpi     Output lpi     Scanning dpi
   ------------------------------------------------------------

   Monitor              96              na              96
   Laser printer       300            55-65            120
   Laser printer       600            65-85            150

   Dye sub printer     300            55-70            125
   Imagesetter        1250+         120-150            300

</PRE></OL>NOTE: The figures for scanning dots per inch (dpi) are the most common for
that kind of device. Check the user's manual for your printer or monitor if
you want to determine the output lpi and scanning dpi more precisely.

your document or presentation instead of using OLE.

<P><h3>Compression options</h3>
 
<P>
JPEG. Reduces the number of bits in the image by eliminating repetitive
image data or image data that is hard to see. JPEG can achieve much greater
compression than other methods, but the results may not be fully
reversible. At higher compression ratios (greater than 20:1), JPEG degrades
the quality of the image. JPEG is available only for true color images.
<P>
LZW (Lempel-Zif compression). Translates common patterns in an image into
short codes. LZW is best at preserving all the image data and achieving
good compression, but it does not achieve the high compression ratios that
JPEG does. LZW is available for monochrome, grayscale, palette, and true
color images. GIF and interlaced GIF use LZW compression.
<P>
LZW and Differencing. Compresses the differences between adjacent pixels
instead of the actual value of the distance between them. Differencing
enhances LZW compression. LZW and Differencing is available for grayscale,
palette, and true color images.
<P>
RLE (Run Length Encoding). Associates a count with a pixel value. For
example, a line of 250 blue pixels is encoded by the number 250, followed
by the numerical value for blue. RLE gives good compression ratios for
images that have large blocks of constant color. RLE is available for
monochrome images as well as palette and true color Windows Bitmap (*.bmp)
images.
<P>
CCITT Group 3 and Group 4. Uses modified Huffman encoding, in which pixels
are compressed based on a table of patterns that represents the typical
patterns in an image. These are facsimile-compatible compression routines.
CCITT is available for monochrome images only. CCITT Group 3 provides good
results with text but poor results with images. CCITT Group 4 compresses an
image in two dimensions and usually produces a higher compression ratio
than Group 3. Many programs support Group 3 but not Group 4.
<P>
<P><h3>Saving Transparency in an Image</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft Photo Editor supports three file formats that save transparency:
CompuServ GIF (GIF), Tagged Image File Format (TIFF), and Portable Network
Graphics (PNG). Transparency in an image is saved in two ways: as a
transparent color or in an alpha channel.
<P>
GIF saves images as monochrome (line art) or 8-bit (grayscale or 256-color)
images. GIF saves all transparency values by substituting a transparent
color in place of the designated color. If you are concerned about loss of
image data, use TIFF or PNG to save your image. If you prefer GIF and want
to preserve all the image data, save a copy of your image in another format
before saving transparency conversions in GIF.
<P>
TIFF saves images as monochrome, 8-bit, or 24-bit (true color) images. In
24-bit images, TIFF saves transparency in an alpha channel. For monochrome
and 8-bit TIFF images, however, Microsoft Photo Editor does not save
transparency.
<P>
PNG saves images as 8-bit or 24-bit images. In 24-bit images, PNG saves
transparency in an alpha channel. In 8-bit images, PNG substitutes a
transparent color on the palette.
