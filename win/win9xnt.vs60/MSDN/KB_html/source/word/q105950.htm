The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
You double-click a picture in Word 6.0, it opens in the Word Picture
Editor, and when you close it, your picture has changed size.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
If you set your default picture editor to MSDraw and then remove
MSDraw from your system or move it to a different location, the Word
6.0 Picture Editor will be loaded when you double-click a picture.
When you close the Word 6.0 Picture Editor, your picture will have
changed size because the Picture Editor scales pictures differently
than MSDraw.
<P>
(Note: To set your default picture editor, choose Options Edit from
the Tools menu.)
<P>
<P><h2>SOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Update the REG.DAT file by remerging the WINWORD6.REG file located in
the Word for Windows directory. Here are the steps to do this:

<OL><P><LI>From Program Manager, choose Run from the File menu.

<P><LI>On the command line, type "regedit" (without the quotation marks)
   and choose the OK button.

<P><LI>From the File menu of the Registration Editor, choose Merge
   Registration File.

<P><LI>Change to the Word for Windows directory, select WINWORD6.REG, and
   choose OK.
<P>
   A message should appear telling you the information has been
   successfully merged.

<P><LI>Exit Windows and restart Windows to read the updated information.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs because the REG.DAT file is no longer up to date
once you remove MSDraw from your system or move it to a different
location. When you double-click a picture in Word, your system tries
to find the default editor, MSDraw, but cannot. Therefore, it defaults
to the Word 6.0 Picture Editor.
<P>
Since the REG.DAT file still indicates that MSDraw is the editor, the
picture is handled as if it were in MSDraw, even though it is actually
loaded into the Word 6.0 Picture Editor. MSDraw and the Word 6.0
Picture Editor scale pictures differently, so when you close the
Picture Editor, the picture gets improperly scaled.
