<P><h2>CASE 1</h2>
 
<P>
<PRE>     Symptoms:   When you try to view a document's properties in Word,
                 you receive the following error message:

                 Cannot retrieve properties for &lt;document name&gt;.

     Causes:     This error message occurs for either of the following
                 reasons:

                 Cause A: The document is currently open in Quick View.

                 Cause B: You are viewing file information in Word's
                          Preview mode, AND the document does not
                          contain a Preview Picture.

                 If you are viewing the list of files in Preview mode,
                 both Cause A and Cause B may be true.

     Resolution: Cause A: Switch to the Quick View window by selecting
                          it on the Windows Taskbar. On the File menu,
                          click Exit. Switch back to Word and view the
                          document properties.

                          Note: If you exit from Quick View and still
                                receive the error message when you try
                                to view the properties, there may be
                                another instance of Quick View with the
                                same document open, or you may be
                                viewing the document in Preview mode.
                                See the resolution for Cause B to
                                eliminate the error message.

                 Cause B: Either switch to a different view (such as
                          List Details, or Properties), or open the
                          file and save a Preview Picture.

                          To save a Preview Picture:

                          1. Open the document.

                          2. On the File menu, click Properties.

                          3. Click the Summary tab.

                          4. Select the Save Preview Picture check box.

                          5. Click OK.

                          6. Save the document.

          Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft
          Word versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c, 7.0, and 7.0a. This problem
          was corrected in Microsoft Word 97 for Windows.

</PRE><h2>CASE 2</h2>

<PRE>     Symptoms:   When you open a document, it opens in read-only mode.

     Cause:      The document is currently opened in Quick View.

                 Windows Taskbar. On the File menu, click Exit. Return
                 to Word and view the document properties.

                 right click the mouse button, and attempt to Rename or

                 protected and that the file is not currently in use.

     Cause:      The document is currently opened in Quick View.

     Resolution: Switch to the Quick View window by selecting it on the

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Quick View is an option added to the File Open Shortcut menu by Windows
95. When Quick View is used to view a document, Word cannot retrieve
the document properties because the file is already open. If you open
the document in Word, Word makes a copy of the file and opens the copy
as read-only.
<P>
To add Quick View to the File Open Shortcut menu, use the following
steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click the Windows Start button, and point to Settings.

<P><LI>Click Control Panel.

<P><LI>Double-click Add/Remove Programs.

<P><LI>Click the Windows Setup tab.

<P><LI>Select Accessories and click Details.

<P><LI>Select Quick View and click OK.

<P><LI>Click OK and follow the Windows 95 Setup prompts.
