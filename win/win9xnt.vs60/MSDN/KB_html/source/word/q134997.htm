The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows 95, versions 7.0, 7.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The following is general information about the proofing tools for Word for
Windows 95.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h2>FILE NAMES</h2>
 
<P>
The following are the filenames for the US proofing tools. The spelling and
hyphenation .lex files support both US and UK English. To get the UK
option, format text as UK English.
<P>
<PRE>   Tool              Filenames (.dll, .lex)
   --------------------------------------------

   Speller           Mssp232.dll, Mssp2_en.lex
   Thesaurus         Msth32.dll,  Msth_Am.lex
   Hyphenation       Hyph32.dll,  Hy_En.lex
   Grammar           Gram32.dll,  Gr_Am.lex

</PRE><h2>LOCATION OF THE TOOLS</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>For Windows 95</h3>
 
<P>
The speller and thesaurus are placed in the shared Office for Window 95
folder (Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Proof) because these
tools may be used by other Microsoft programs. In a network installation,
the shared tools may be placed elsewhere.
<P>
The hyphenation and grammar tools are placed in the private Word for
Windows 95 folder.
<P>
<P><h3>For Windows NT 3.51 Setups</h3>
 
<P>
The speller and thesaurus are placed in the shared Windows NT folder
(Winnt35\msapps\proof) because these tools may be used by other Microsoft
programs. In a network installation, the shared tools may be placed
elsewhere.
<P>
The hyphenation and grammar tools are placed in the private Word for
Windows 95 folder.
<P>
The Word for Windows 95 speller and grammar checker should overwrite the
Word 6.0 for Windows NT files, as the version numbers are incremented. The
.lex files for all the tools should be updated, if necessary.
<P>
<P><h2>Coexistence with Soft-Art Speller</h2>
 
<P>
The Word for Windows 95 Inso speller (Mssp232.dll) will coexist with the
Soft-Art speller (Mssp32.dll) in the shared directory if they both support
one or more different languages. If not, Word for Windows 95 Setup replaces
the Soft-Art speller with the Word speller.
<P>
The Soft-Art speller ships with Microsoft Excel for Windows NT, Microsoft
Excel for Windows 95, Windows 95 Exchange, Works for Windows 95, PowerPoint
for Windows 95, FoxPro for Windows 95, and Microsoft Access for Windows 95.
Office for Windows 95 ships only the Inso speller.
<P>
<P><h2>.Ini Entries</h2>
 
<P>
For Word and Office for Windows 95, the path lines for the proofing tools
are written to the registry, instead of to the Winword6.ini file under the
[Microsoft Word] section, and/or to the Win.ini file under the [MS Proofing
Tools] section.
<P>
Setup registers the shared tools, including custom dictionaries, to the
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE location under Software\Microsoft\Shared Tools\Proofing
Tools.
<P>
Setup registers the grammar checker and the hyphenator to the
HKEY_CURRENT_USER location under Software\Microsoft\Word\7.0\Proofing
Tools. All the tools are also self-registered to this location if the
registry is damaged or changed and the tools are in one of the expected
locations for self-registering (see more information on the search
hierarchy below).
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Installing Word for Windows 95 over Word 6.0</h3>
 
<P>
The Word 6.0 proofing dictionaries are fully compatible with Word for
Windows 95. You should have no need to upgrade your Alki Software Proofing
Tool Kit, unless you need a kit containing the Inso thesaurus (Portuguese
Brazilian, Portuguese Iberian, Catalan, or Finnish), or the French,
Italian, or Russian grammar checkers. These tools were not upgraded to 32-
bit packages for Word 6.0 for Windows NT, so if you have the kit for Word
6.0 for Windows, you need to upgrade the kit to get the 32-bit engine.
There may also have been changes to other Eastern European tools. I you
have questions, contact Alki Software.
<P>
To upgrade Word 2.0x for Windows proofing tools or to buy additional
foreign language proofing tools, contact Alki Software. Alki supplies
foreign language proofing tool kits and specialized proofing tools
(comprehensive US &amp; UK English speller and hyphenation, which includes
Medical and Legal terms, and comprehensive US English thesaurus).

</PRE>Installation Note: Alki proposes that the private tools be installed in the
Proof folder, which is a subfolder of the Word program folder, and the
shared tools to be installed in the shared tools directory.
<P>
<P><h2>Compatibility with the Softart Proofing Tools</h2>
 
<P>
Word for Windows 95 continues to be CSAPI compliant and is fully compatible
with the Softart 32-bit Mssp32.dll and its Mssp_xx.lex files.
<P>
The thesaurus is now fully CTAPI compliant.
<P>
The Inso and Softart thesaurus files are now fully enabled for sharing by
other programs.
