The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you perform a local installation of Word 97, and then enable User
Profiles so that the local installation of Word is shared by several people
using the same computer, you may have problems with the way the Normal.dot
file is managed. For example, you may notice the following symptoms:

<UL><LI>You receive an error message about the Normal.dot file being read-only.

<LI>You inherit settings and options that belong to other users.

<LI>You are unable to customize certain options.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
In a local installation, the template location is not unique for each user.
For the first user, the Normal.dot file is created in the correct location
(\Program Files\Microsoft Office \Templates). When subsequent users log on,
the location of the Normal.dot is replicated, so Word defaults to the
\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office directory and creates another
Normal.dot there.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1 – Manually Change the User Templates Location</h3>
 
<P>
In order to customize each instance of Word, each user must have a unique
copy of the Normal.dot file. The location of the Normal.dot file is
controlled by a customization setting. To change the location of the
Normal.dot so that it will be unique for each user, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Create a unique folder for each user.

<P><LI>Have the user log on to the computer.

<P><LI>Start Word.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Options.

<P><LI>Click the File Locations tab.

<P><LI>Click the User Templates setting and click Modify.

<P><LI>Navigate to the unique folder you created in step 1 and click OK.
<P>
   If you want copies of the Office Templates for each user, you can copy
   the Office Templates from the \Program Files\Microsoft Office\Templates
   folder to the folder you created in step 1.
<P>
</OL>If you want the users to share the Office templates, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Have the user log on the computer.

<P><LI>Start Word.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Options.

<P><LI>Click the File Locations tab.

<P><LI>Click the Workgroup Templates setting and click Modify.

<P><LI>Navigate to the Office Templates folder (the most likely location for
   this folder is \Program Files\Microsoft Office\Templates), and click OK.
<P>
</OL>Now, when you click New on the File menu, you will see a combination of the
User Templates (the user's Normal.dot and other user-specific templates)
and Workgroup templates (the templates the user is sharing with other
users).
<P>
<P><h3>Method 2--Perform a Server/Workstation Installation</h3>
 
<P>
To perform an Administrative setup on the computer and then perform a
Workstation setup for each user, use the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Create a unique folder for each user and a folder for the server
   installation of Word.

<P><LI>Log in as the administrator and run the "setup /a" command on the server
   folder on the computer.

<P><LI>Log on as one of the users and perform a workstation installation.
   Install to the user's unique folder you created in step 1. Repeat this
   step for each user.
<P>
</OL>This will install the program files to the server folder and create a
Normal.dot template for each user on the system.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The User Templates setting is typically used to indicate a location for
templates that you may want to customize. Generally, the Normal.dot file
is stored in this location so that users can save changes (such as a
default font, custom styles, and so on) to their work environments.
<P>
The Workgroup Templates setting is typically used to indicate a location
for templates that are shared with other users. Because multiple users will
be using the same templates in this situation, either no users will be able
to save changes to the templates (if they are marked as read only), or only
the first user will be able to save changes to the template (the first user
gets full control or the template and the other users get read only
access).
<P>
The following components are stored in the Normal.dot global template.
Customization of any of these features will require a separate Normal.dot
file for each user:
<P>
<PRE>   Boilerplate text and graphics

   Template styles

   Default settings (font, margins, page size, and so on)

   Some AutoText entries

   Some macros

   Some custom menu and toolbar settings

</PRE></OL>If you install Office using a Run From Server setup, rather than by
performing a local installation, the effects are slightly different. The
first time the new user quits Word, the user will see a message stating
that the Normal.dot has been changed, but the changes can't be saved
because the file is read-only. The User Templates path in the registry for
this user is pointing to the Office folder, which in this case is on the
server, and is read-only.
<P>
NOTE: The message is slightly misleading. The Normal.dot does not yet exist
in that location. Word is trying to save a new, default Normal.dot for this
user in the User Templates location.
<P>
To work around this situation, use one of the workarounds listed in the
"Workaround" section of this article.
