The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, version 6.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article lists the problems in Word version 6.0 for Windows that
are corrected in the Word 6.0a upgrade. If you are experiencing one
of the problems listed below, you should obtain the Word 6.0a Patch.
<P>
If you have a network installation of Word 6.0, you cannot use the Word
6.0a Patch to upgrade your installation; you must obtain a full Word 6.0a
disk set by mail (free of charge). To obtain Word 6.0a, call the Microsoft
Order Desk at (800) 360-7561 and request Word version 6.0a for Windows. If
you are outside the United States, contact your local subsidiary. To locate
your subsidiary, see the Microsoft World Wide Offices Web site at:

</PRE><h2>WORD 6.0 PROBLEMS CORRECTED IN WORD 6.0A</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Disk Error While Saving, Embedded Object Becomes a Box</h3>
 
<P>
When you move an embedded object within a document using either
cut-and-paste or drag-and-drop, and you then (full) save the document,
the object may change appearance and will be uneditable. The
object usually becomes an empty square box. Subsequent save attempts
will result in "Disk is full," "too many edits," or "operation will
be incomplete" error messages.
<P>
<P><h3>Problems Caused By SHARE.EXE Corrected in VSHARE.386</h3>
 
<P>
Word 6.0a includes an updated VSHARE.386 file. This revised version of
VSHARE.386 ships with Word 6.0a to replace SHARE.EXE. This version of
VSHARE.386 provides greater compatibility with many applications running
under Windows 3.1 or Windows for Workgroups 3.1 and later. To run Windows
in standard mode, you still need SHARE.EXE.
<P>
<P><h3>"General Mail Failure" Error Editing Routing Slip on a Mail Gateway</h3>
 
<P>
If you edit a routing slip in a Word document, a "General Mail
Failure" error message may occur.
<P>
<P><h3>No kerning with Adobe Type Manager (ATM) Fonts</h3>
 
<P>
ATM fonts do not print kerned, because ATM fonts use an older application
program interface (API) for kerning; this API is not supported in Word 6.0.
Word 6.0a supports the older API.
<P>
<P><h3>"Not available" Error Messages with Adobe Type Manager (ATM) Fonts</h3>
 
<P>
Word displays the following error message for a group of Adobe Type 1
fonts, even though they are available on the system:
<P>
<PRE>   The font '&lt;font name&gt;' is not available on your system. Do you want
   to use it anyway?

</PRE><h3>No Anti-Aliasing for TrueType Fonts</h3>
 
<P>
On a computer running an ATI Crystal Font video driver (or similar
driver), the Crystal fonts are displayed with clean, nonjagged edges due
to anti-aliasing. TrueType fonts, however, are displayed with jagged edges
because no anti-aliasing occurs.
<P>
<P><h3>Can't Remove Space Around Footnote Reference Marks</h3>
 
<P>
By design, Word 6.0 places white space after automatic footnote
reference marks. In response to customer requests, Word 6.0a inserts
the white space as a regular space character to the right of the
footnote reference mark, which means you can edit or remove it if you
want.
<P>
<P><h3>Dr. Watson Errors in Examples and Demos</h3>
 
<P>
The Dr. Watson program displays errors when you choose the Examples And
Demos command from the Help menu.
<P>
<P><h3>Cannot Remove Borders on Pictures</h3>
 
<P>
Sometimes you cannot remove a portion of a border from an inserted
picture or object, even when you choose None in the Format Borders
And Shading dialog box.
<P>
<P><h3>Cross-References Updated Incorrectly</h3>
 
<P>
Bookmarks for captions change (shrink) to include only the caption
label (instead of the full text of the caption) when you insert new
captions later in the document. When you update cross-references to
these captions, the cross-reference includes only the caption label.
<P>
<P><h3>SEQ Field Displayed Incorrectly</h3>
 
<P>
The result of a SEQ (sequence) field in the header and footer pane displays
"1" or "0" (zero) instead of the correct number in the sequence; although
the displayed version of this field is incorrect, the printed version of is
correct.
<P>
<P><h3>Password Displays in Converted File</h3>
 
<P>
If you save a password-protected document in another file format, the
password appears as text in the converted file.
<P>
<P><h3>GP Fault Creating New Document Based on Template With Link to Excel</h3>
 
<P>
When you start Word with the /n switch, a general protection (GP) fault
occurs if you create a new Word document based on a template that contains
a link to a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet.
<P>
<P><h3>Fonts Printed Without Kerning</h3>
 
<P>
Fonts do not print kerned in point sizes larger than the Kerning For
Fonts setting in the Format Fonts dialog box. Fonts print kerned only if
they are formatted with the point size specified by the Kerning For Fonts
setting.
<P>
<P><h3>Word 2.x Mail Merge Document Loses Data Delimiters in Header</h3>
 
<P>
When you open a Word 2.x for Windows mail merge main document, and if the
data document is not a Word 2.x table, Word 6.0 removes the delimiters from
the header record, which concatenates all the field names in your data
document. In other words, Word reads the header record as a single field
name (for example, NameAddressCityZip).
<P>
<P><h3>Different Hierarchy for Choosing Which Same-Name Macro to Run</h3>
 
<P>
Word 6.0 follows a different set of rules than Word 2.x to determine which
template macro to run when two macros have the same name: Word 2.x runs the
macro from the template attached to the document in which the insertion
point is currently located, while Word 6.0 runs the macro from the template
from which you launched the macro.
<P>
Word 6.0a includes a the following new WordBasic macro command:
<P>
<PRE>   WW2CallingConvention([-1,0])

</PRE>You can use this command to set either the Word 2.x or Word 6.0 macro
precedence method.
<P>
<P><h3>Cannot Open Password-Protected Paradox 3.5 Files</h3>
 
<P>
A "File Access Denied" error occurs and you cannot open (via ODBC) a
password-protected file created in Paradox version 3.5 because Word 6.0
does not prompt you for the password. You can open these files in Word 6.0a
because the ODBC driver prompts you for the password.
<P>
<P><h3>Insertion Point Scrolls Off Screen with WordPerfect Help On</h3>
 
<P>
If the WordPerfect Help option is selected and you press ENTER
several times, Word 6.0 scrolls the insertion point off the bottom of
the screen instead of advancing the screen.
<P>
<P><h3>Cannot Create Non-File Links</h3>
 
<P>
In Word 6.0, you cannot create a link to server an application that
does not use a filename to reference data. For example, Word 6.0 is
incompatible with a database program that references a database by
name and does not use the name of the file.
<P>
<P><h3>Computer Hangs Launching Word as Server When WordPerfect Help Is On</h3>
 
<P>
If the Navigation Keys for WordPerfect Users option is turned on and
you launch Word from another OLE 2 program, your computer may hang
(stop responding) when you press the ESC key. Sometimes it takes
a while for the hang to occur.
<P>
<P><h3>GP Fault Updating Large Number of Links</h3>
 
<P>
A GP fault may occur when you update a large number of links
(typically from 80 to 200).
<P>
<P><h3>"Out of Memory" Error Opening Microsoft Excel 5.0 Chart</h3>
 
<P>
When you open an embedded Microsoft Excel 5.0 chart using the Open
command (to edit the chart in a separate Microsoft Excel window), an
"Out of memory" error message occurs. This does not happen when you
edit the chart in place (in situ) in Word.
<P>
<P><h3>Key Assignments Not Saved in Templates</h3>
 
<P>
Word does not save template key assignments to the TAB and SHIFT+TAB keys.
<P>
<P><h3>GP Fault Running Find File Command</h3>
 
<P>
If you start Word using the /n switch and then open the Find File
dialog box (by choosing Find File from the File menu), a GP fault
occurs if the View option is set to Preview in the Find File dialog
box.
<P>
<P><h3>Wrong Chapter Numbers on Last Page of Document</h3>
 
<P>
The chapter number always displays as "1" on the last page of your
document in page layout view, regardless of the actual chapter
number.
<P>
<P><h3>Wrong Chapter Number with Page Break Preceding Heading Paragraph</h3>
 
<P>
When your document includes chapter numbers in the page number, if a
page break immediately precedes a heading paragraph that marks the
beginning of a chapter, the wrong chapter number appears in the
header or footer on that page.
<P>
<P><h3>Error Messages About Printer Port</h3>
 
<P>
By design, Word 6.0 confirms the validity of a port before printing. If
there is no port present, Word displays an error message. With some
configurations, however, Word incorrectly concludes that the printer port
is not present and displays a "Local Port Not Present" error message.
<P>
<P><h3>GP Fault with INCLUDETEXT Field</h3>
 
<P>
If you update an INCLUDETEXT field that references a bookmarked table cell
in another document, a GP fault occurs. This error does not occur if the
bookmark is not in a table cell.
<P>
<P><h3>DATE Field Result Clipped in Invoice Template</h3>
 
<P>
The result of the DATE field in the third column, first row, of
documents based on the Invoice template (INVOICE.DOT) is truncated on
the right side when you print it.
<P>
