<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Word does not have a built-in method for printing booklets whose pages are
not laid out continuously. This ability is necessary to print pages that
will be folded and stapled together to form a landscape brochure.
<P>
For example, a pamphlet composed of two sheets of paper and totaling eight
pages when folded and stapled must be printed with the following layout:
<P>
<PRE>       page 1         page 2         page 3         page 4
    -----------    -----------    -----------    -----------
   | p8  .  p1 |  | p2  .  p7 |  | p6  .  p3 |  | p4  .  p5 |
   |     .     |  |     .     |  |     .     |  |     .     |
   |     .     |  |     .     |  |     .     |  |     .     |
   |     .     |  |     .     |  |     .     |  |     .     |
   |     .     |  |     .     |  |     .     |  |     .     |
   |     .     |  |     .     |  |     .     |  |     .     |
   |     .     |  |     .     |  |     .     |  |     .     |
    -----------    -----------    -----------    -----------

</PRE><h3>Word 97 for Windows</h3>
 
You may easily accomplish a booklet type of layout by using a new feature
in Word 97 called linked textboxes. Linked textboxes are two or more
textboxes formatted such that the text flows from one textbox to the next.
<P>
You could create 2 textboxes per page, corresponding to each page of the
pamphlet. You can then link the textbox for pamphlet page 1 to the textbox
for pamphlet page 2, and so on for each page in the pamphlet. Once this is
done, you may start your typing in textbox 1 and it will automatically flow
into the correct textboxes (pamphlet pages) as needed.
<P>
See the reference section of this article for resources on linked
textboxes.
<P>
<P><h3>Word 6.0 for Windows</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft ships an application note(WD1025 Supplemental Macros for Word 6.0
for Windows) of WordBasic samples that contains a Fold-over-book macro.
Although it will not operate if tables are contained within the document,
it will adjust large documents and add page numbers in the footers.
<P>
NOTE:  This was created to run properly in Word 6.0 for Windows. It will
not operate in Word 2.x for Windows and was not tested for Word 7.0 or
Word 97 for Windows.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 2</h3>
 
<P>
There are two third-party programs that work with Word for Windows that can
accomplish this.
