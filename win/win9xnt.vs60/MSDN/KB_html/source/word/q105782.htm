The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, version 6.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When using the FindFile feature in Word for Windows version 6.0, trying to
locate files on a network drive may produce an empty list.  This can happen
when any number of special characters, like an underscore, period or space
are a part of the network name. This may also occur if the network drive
specified does not exist or the drive is password protected and Word does
not know the password. In either case, no error message is returned.
<P>
Note: The Novell Netware parameter, Maximum Outstanding NCP Searches =,
will product similar symptoms. Try increasing the maximum.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
In order to work around this problem, add the following line to the
WINWORD6.INI file in the [Microsoft Word] section to tell Word for Windows
to use the drive letter:
<P>
<PRE>   NoLongNetNames=Yes

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When a network drive is specified, Word for Windows uses the UNC name
rather than the drive letter to reference that drive. For example,
given a network connection q:\\servername\sharename and a search from
File Find, the Search List under File Find will record the net drive
as \\servername\sharename by default. But if the NoLongNetNames=Yes
line is included in the WINWORD6.INI under the [Microsoft Word]
section, the Search List will record q: for the net drive.
<P>
UNC redirection is supported by Microsoft LAN Manager versions 1.1 and
later and by 100-percent-LAN-Manager-compatible networks.
<P>
For more information on UNC support in Microsoft Windows, query on
the following words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   UNC and windows and 3.1 and convention

</PRE>When Find File searches a network drive that does not exist, no error
message is returned. If the drive does exist but is password protected and
you have not connected to the drive in this Windows session, Word does not
prompt you for the password, but instead acts as though the drive was
searched and no files were found. If you connect to the password-protected
network drive and then search for the file using Word Find File before you
exit and restart Windows, Word will search the drive and return an accurate
list of files on the drive.
