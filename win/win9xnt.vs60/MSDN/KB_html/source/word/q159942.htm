<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article answers the most frequently asked questions about text boxes
in Word 97.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 

<PRE>1. Q. What happened to the Frame command?

   A. Frames are still available in Word 97; however, in most cases, you
      should use a text box rather than a frame. Text boxes were added to
      Word 97 to provide a better way to manipulate text and to take
      advantage of new graphical effects. Text boxes provide nearly all the
      advantages of frames and they provide many additional advantages that
      frames do not provide.  For example, with text boxes you can:

      - Create links that make text flow from one part of a document to
        another.

      - Create a watermark.

      - Use the formatting options on the new Drawing toolbar. For example,
        you can apply 3-D effects, shadows, border styles, colors, fills,
        and backgrounds.

      - Choose from a greater variety of text-wrapping options.

      - Change the orientation of text in a text box using the Text
        Direction command (Format menu).

      - Group text boxes and change the alignment or distribution
        of them as a group.

2. Q. Are there special cases when I will need to use a frame instead of a
      text box?

      Use a frame instead of a text box when you want to position text or
      graphics that contain one or more of the following:

      - Comments.

      - Footnotes.

      - Certain fields: AutoNum, AutoNumLgl, AutoNumOut (These fields are
        used for numbering lists and paragraphs in legal documents and
        outlines); TC (table of contents entry); TOC (table of contents);
        RD (referenced document); XE (index entry); TA (table of
        authorities entry); and TOA (table of authority).

      To add the Frame command to the Insert menu, use the following steps:

      a) On the Tools menu, click Customize, and then click the
         Commands tab.

      b) In the Customize dialog box, under Categories, select All
         Commands.

      c) In the Commands list, click InsertFrame.

      d) Drag InsertFrame to the desired location on the Insert menu.
         Release the mouse button when you see a horizontal bar indicating
         the location on the menu where the command will be inserted.

      e) Click Close.

3. Q. What happens to the frames when I convert a document from a previous
      version of Word.

      When you convert a document that contains frames, the frames are
      retained. When you select a frame, the Frame command (Format menu)
      becomes available.

      To replace the frame with a text box, do the following:

      a) On the Insert menu, click Text Box.

      b) Click once in the document area.

         A 1-inch square text box is inserted in your document.

      c) Resize and reposition the text box if necessary.

      d) Select the text inside the frame, and then click Cut on the Edit
         menu.

      e) Position the insertion point inside the text box, and then click
         Paste on the Edit menu.

4. Q. What are linked text boxes and how do I use them?

   A. Linked text boxes are two or more text boxes formatted such that the
      text flows from one text box to the next. To create linked text boxes
      use the following steps:

      a) Create two or more text boxes.

      b) Select the first text box.

      c) Click the Create Text Box Link button on the Text Box toolbar.

         The mouse pointer changes into a pitcher.

      d) Click inside the text box that will contain the overflow text.

         When the pointer rests over this text box, the pitcher "pours" the
         text from the previous text box into the empty text box.

      e) To create the next link, select the text box you linked to in
         step d, and then repeat steps c and d.

      g) Starting with the first text box, type the text. It will flow
         from one text box to the next in the order that you linked them.

5. Q. How many text boxes can I link together?

   A. The maximum number of text boxes that you can link together is 32
      (for a total of 31 links)

6. Q. Can I link text boxes across documents or across subdocuments
      in a master document?

   A. No. Linked text boxes must be contained in a single document. You
      cannot create text box links from one subdocument to another
      subdocument. You also cannot split subdocuments that contain linked
      text boxes.

7. Q. I started to link text boxes (represented by the pitcher icon),
      but I changed my mind. How do I cancel this action?

   A. Press ESC to cancel the linking process.

8. Q. How do I add, remove, or change the appearance of my text box.

   A. To change the appearance of a text box--for instance, to remove or
      change borders or to add background colors or textures--select the
      text box, and click the Text Box command on the Format menu.

      You can also change the text box to an AutoShape. To change a text
      box to an AutoShape:

      a. Select the text box.

      b. On the Drawing toolbar click Draw and point to Change AutoShape.

      c. Point to the category of shapes you want to use to in place of
         the text box and click the AutoShape.

9. Q. Can AutoShapes contain text and can I link them?

   A. Yes. You can link AutoShapes, such as circles, banners, and flow
      chart shapes, and they can contain text. (You cannot link lines or
      freeform shapes.) To insert an AutoShape and add text, use these
      steps:

      a) Click AutoShapes on the Drawing Toolbar, point to the shape
         type (for example, point to Callouts), and then click the shape
         you want to insert.

      b) With the right mouse button, click the AutoShape object, and then
         click Edit Text.

      c) Repeat steps a and b for each AutoShape you want to link.

      d) Starting with the first AutoShape, type the text that you want to
         appear in the linked AutoShapes.

</PRE>10.Q. How do you convert a Text Box to a frame?
<P>
<PRE>   A. If you prefer to use a frame instead of a Text Box, do the following
      if the Text Box is already in the document:

      a) Click on the Text Box to select it.

      b) Click Text Box on the Format menu.
 
      c) Click the Text Box tab.

      d) Click the Convert to Frame button. You will receive the following
         information dialog box:

            When you convert this drawing object to a frame, some of the
            drawing object's formatting may be lost. Do you want to
            continue?

      e) Click OK.
