The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you attempt to open a WordPerfect file that has an extension other
than "doc" or "wpd" in Word, Word may open the file in text-only format.
<P>
NOTE: When the file is opened as text, the document will be displayed
incorrectly and you will see strange or incorrect (garbage) characters.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When the WordPerfect file you are opening has an extension other than .doc
or .wpd, Word may not recognize the file as a WordPerfect document and may
use the wrong file converter to open the file.
<P>
When Word cannot determine which file converter to use, it will use the
Text Only file converter.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor
can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.
<P>
<P><h3>Setting Word to Open a WordPerfect File with a Different Extension</h3>
 
<P>
To set word to open a WordPerfect file with a different extension, follow
these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Quit Word and all other Windows programs.

<P><LI>On the Start menu, click Run.

<P><LI>In the Open box, type "RegEdit" (without the quotation marks) and click
    OK.

<P><LI>In the Registry Editor, open the following Import registry key:
<P>
       HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Shared Tools\Text
       Converters\Import
<P>
    -or-
<P>
    The Import key may be located in the following location in the
    registry:
<P>
       HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\8.0\Word\Text
       Converters\Import

<P><LI>In the WordPerfect6x key, click to select Extensions.

<P><LI>On the Edit menu, click Modify.

<P><LI>In the Value Data box, you may see some extensions similar to the
    following:
<P>
       doc wpd

<P><LI>Add your specific extension to this list.
<P>
    For example, if you have saved files in WordPerfect with a "wp7"
    extension, add the wp7 extension to the Value Data box. The Value
    Data box should now resemble the following:
<P>
       doc wpd wp7
<P>
   NOTE: You can add all the different extensions you use for saving your
   WordPerfect files to this list.

<P><LI>Repeat steps 7-8 for each extension you want to add, and then click OK.

<P><LI>On the Registry menu, click Exit.
<P>
</OL>After you restart Word, it will use the WordPerfect 6.x file converter to
open your WordPerfect files with the different extensions.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To specify which file converter to use when Word opens a WordPerfect file,
follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Start Word and open a new, blank document.
<P>
   Do not try to open your WordPerfect file.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Options.

<P><LI>On the General tab, click to select the "Confirm conversion at open"
   check box, and then click OK.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Open.

<P><LI>Select the WordPerfect document you want to open, and then click Open.

<P><LI>In the Convert File dialog box, select WordPerfect 6.x, and then click
   OK.
<P>
</OL>Word will now open your WordPerfect document correctly using the
WordPerfect 6.x converter.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Starting with WordPerfect version 6.x, the default file extension when
saving files from WordPerfect is "wpd." Microsoft Word will automatically
recognize and open files created in WordPerfect 6.x and later with the
"wpd" extension.
