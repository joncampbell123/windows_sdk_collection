<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you print from Word 6.0 for Windows the Print To File option under
File Print is unavailable (dimmed). This problem has been reported with the
following printers:
<P>
<PRE>   IBM 4019, using an IBM driver version earlier than 4.11 (IBM4019.DRV)
   Canon LBP8 Mark 3 with v.3.09 of driver.

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
The problem with the IBM 4019 has been corrected in version 4.11 (and
later) of the driver. Contact Lexmark at (606) 232-3000 for the updated
version of the 4019 driver.
<P>
The problem with the Canon LBP8 was corrected withe the later European
version of driver (v2.12) available from Canon. Contact Canon Technical
Support at (800) 423-2366.
<P>
This problem was corrected in Word version 7.0 for Windows 95.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem:

<OL><P><LI>Run Windows Control Panel and choose Printers.

<P><LI>Choose Connect.

<P><LI>In the Ports box, change the setting from LPT1 to FILE.

<P><LI>Print the document from Word.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: This procedure changes the setting for all your Windows applications.
You may want to go back into the Control Panel and change the setting back
to LPT1 when you are through printing your document, otherwise all printing
from Windows will go to FILE.
