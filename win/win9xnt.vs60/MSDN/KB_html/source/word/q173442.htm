The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows NT, version 6.0
<LI>Microsoft Word for the Macintosh, versions 6.0, 6.0.1, 6.0.1a
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows 95, versions 7.0, 7.0a
<LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Word 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you import a WordPerfect document into Microsoft Word, the document may
contain large gaps between paragraphs.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when the WordPerfect document contains secondary
leading with a negative value. (To adjust this setting in WordPerfect,
press SHIFT+F8, 4, 6, 6).
<P>
For example, a secondary leading of -3 points in WordPerfect results in
652.35 points of spacing after paragraphs in Word. (To adjust this setting
in Word, click Paragraph on the Format menu).
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, use either of the following methods.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1: Remove the Spacing After Value in Word</h3>
 
<P>
To fix this problem after you have imported the document into Word, follow
these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Edit menu, click Select All.

<P><LI>On the Format menu, click Paragraph, and then click the Indents And
   Spacing tab.

<P><LI>Change the Spacing After setting to 0 pt.

<P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
</OL><h3>Method 2: Change the Negative Value Before Converting to Word</h3>
 
<P>
To prevent this problem from occurring, change the negative value for
secondary leading in WordPerfect before you import the document into Word.
Use the appropriate method for your version of WordPerfect.
<P>
WordPerfect 5.1 for MS-DOS:
<P>
In WordPerfect 5.1 for MS-DOS, the secondary leading code is similar to the
Spacing After setting for paragraphs.
<P>
To change this value in WordPerfect 5.1 for MS-DOS, press SHIFT+F8, 4, 6,
6, and reset the Secondary Leading value to 0".
<P>
NOTE: Pressing SHIFT+F8 opens the Format menu. Pressing "4" selects Other
Formats. Pressing "6" selects the Printer Settings menu, and pressing "6"
again selects the Leading value. Press the TAB key or ENTER to place the
cursor on the Secondary value.
<P>
WordPerfect 5.2 for Windows:
<P>
To change this value in WordPerfect 5.2 for Windows, change the Between
Paragraphs [HRt] setting under Line Height (Leading) Adjustment in the
Typesetting dialog box (available on the Layout menu).
<P>
WordPerfect 6.x:
<P>
To change this value in WordPerfect 6.x, change the Adjust Leading setting
on the Word Spacing and Letter Spacing dialog box. Use the Typesetting
command on the Layout menu (in WordPerfect 6.0), or the Format menu (in
WordPerfect 6.1 for Windows).
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the versions of Microsoft
Word listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this
problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
WordPerfect is manufactured by Corel Corporation, a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this
product's performance or reliability.
<P>
In WordPerfect, there are two different codes for line breaks: [SRt] (Soft
Return), and [HRt] (Hard Return).
<P>
<P><h3>The [SRt] Code</h3>
 
<P>
WordPerfect automatically inserts the [SRt] code at the end of each line in
a paragraph. The Leading Primary value in WordPerfect is equivalent to the
Line Spacing setting in Word; it controls how much additional vertical
space is after each line. If you change the Leading Primary value,
WordPerfect adjusts the line spacing for the paragraph.
<P>
<P><h3>The [HRt] Code</h3>
 
<P>
WordPerfect inserts the [HRt] code when you press the ENTER key. This code
is equivalent to the paragraph mark in Word. Therefore, the Leading
Secondary value in WordPerfect is equivalent to the Spacing After setting
in Word. However, unlike the Spacing After setting, you can set Secondary
Leading to a negative number. This forces adjacent paragraphs to overlap.
<P>
Word for the Macintosh version 6.x, Word for Windows 95 version 7.0, and
Word 97 all convert the [HRt] code to the Spacing After setting. However,
because Word does not allow a negative value, it incorrectly sets Spacing
After to a large value (approximately 671.75 points).
