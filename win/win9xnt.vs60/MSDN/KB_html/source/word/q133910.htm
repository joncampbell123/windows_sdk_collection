The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows 95, versions 7.0, 7.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After you save a master document, close it, and reopen it, Word may open
the document as read-only.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
As in Word 6.0, Word 7.0 opens a Master Document as read-only if you are
not the author. To determine who the author is, Word looks at the Author
field on the Summary tab of the File Properties dialog box and compares the
name to the Name field on the User Info tab in the Tools Options dialog
box. If they don't match, Word opens the file as read-only.
<P>
However, unlike Word 6.0, Word 7.0 saves the Author name from the Tools
Options User Info tab when the Master document is created (File New)
instead of when the document is saved for the first time. So it is possible
to start a new document, change the name in the Name field of the User Info
tab in Tools Options, add subdocuments, save the master document, and then
have the master document reopen as read-only because, at this point, the
Author name will not match the User name.
<P>
This problem was corrected in Microsoft Word 97 for Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To open the master document so that you can make changes to the file,
change the Name field on the User Info tab in Tools Options so it matches
the Author field in the document properties of the main document. When you
close and then reopen the master document, Word opens it as read-write.
<P>
To prevent the creation of a master document with an incorrect Author name,
verify that the Name field on the User Info tab in Tools Options is correct
before creating a new document, or verify the Author name on the Summary
tab in File Properties is correct before saving master documents for the
first time.
