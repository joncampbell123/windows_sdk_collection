The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 2.0, 2.0a, 2.0a-CD, 2.0b,
   2.0c
</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article lists the version 3.0 Windows WIN.INI settings for
Microsoft Word version 2.x for Windows. This information can also be
found in Appendix B, page 803, of the "Microsoft Word for Windows
User's Guide."
<P>
When you install version 2.0 or 2.0a of Word for Windows, the Setup
program modifies the WIN.INI file so that it includes all necessary
sections that pertain to Word for Windows. You can change the values
for many of these default settings to customize the appearance and/or
functionality of Word for Windows. To modify the WIN.INI file from
within Word for Windows, choose Options from the Tools menu, and
select the WIN.INI option under Category. The dialog box that appears
allows you to make changes to the various WIN.INI groups that affect
Word for Windows. Each of these settings is discussed below.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Versions 2.0 and 2.0a of Microsoft Word for Windows place several
sections within the WIN.INI file. Below is a list of these sections:
<P>
<PRE>[Microsoft Word 2.0]            This section is used by Word for
                                Windows to locate the application
                                itself, proofing tools (Spelling,
                                Thesaurus, Grammar, and Hyphenation),
                                and the default directory for all
                                Word for Windows 2.0 documents.

[MS Graphic Import Filters]     This section is used by Microsoft Word
                                for Windows to locate and utilize the
                                installed graphic filters.

[MS Proofing Tools]             This section is used by Microsoft Word
                                for Windows to locate custom
                                dictionaries for use with the
                                installed proofing tools.

[MS Word Text Converters]       This section specifies what text
                                converters are installed. It also
                                tells Word where the converters are
                                installed.

</PRE>Note: Word version 2.0 for Windows text converters (DLL files with a
.CNV file extension) are copied to the Word for Windows program
directory during Setup. Graphic filters are copied to the shared
resource directory \WINDOWS\MSAPPS\GRPHFLT.
<P>
<PRE>[MS Word Editable Sections]     This section identifies the WIN.INI section
                                you can edit from within Word for Windows.
                                Sections of the WIN.INI are edited by
                                selecting the Tools menu, choosing Options,
                                selecting the WIN.INI icon in the Category
                                box, and adding or removing information
                                from the Option and Settings boxes.

                                You can edit sections of the WIN.INI
                                that are not listed in the Application
                                box by entering the name of the desired
                                section in the Application box as it
                                appears in WIN.INI. For example, to edit
                                the [Windows] section of the WIN.INI,
                                type Windows in the Application box. The
                                [Windows] section of the WIN.INI appears
                                in the Startup Options box. Closing the
                                Options dialog box saves the Windows entry.

                                Editing a section of the WIN.INI that is
                                not listed in the Application box is also
                                possible by placing a line directly
                                into the [MS Word Editable Sections] of
                                the WIN.INI. For example,

Windows=yes                     would allow the Windows section of the
                                WIN.INI to appear in the Application text
                                box.

</PRE>The following is a list of all the DOCUMENTED settings that can be
used by versions 2.0 and 2.0a of Microsoft Word for Windows. In some
situations, these settings are not present after you set up Word for
Windows on your hard drive. You may need to manually edit the WIN.INI
file and add a particular flag to the correct section of that file.
<P>
Note: These settings can appear in any order. The WIN.INI file is not
case sensitive; any of the settings below can be typed in all
uppercase or lowercase letters or in a combination of both.
<P>
[Microsoft Word 2.0]
<P>
<PRE>ProgramDir=Path                Specifies the drive and directory
                               where the Word for Windows executable
                               file, WINWORD.EXE, is located. For
                               example, ProgramDir=C:\WINWORD

Doc-Path=                      Specifies the drive and directory
                               where Microsoft Word for Windows
                               looks to find all files with a .DOC
                               extension. For example,
                               Doc-Path=C:\WINWORD

Spelling Language,type=        Specifies the drive and directory
                               where added spelling tools may be
                               stored. This can include a separate
                               language dictionary. For example,
                               Spelling=1033,0=c:\WINWORD\SPELL.DLL,
                               c:\WINWORD\SP_AM.LEX

Hyphenate Language,type=       Specifies the drive and directory
                               where added hyphenation tools may
                               be stored. For example, Hyphenate
                               1033,0=C:\WINWORD\HYPH.DLL
                               C:\WINWORD\HY_AM.LEX

Thesaurus language,type=       Specifies the drive and directory
                               where thesaurus files may be stored.
                               For example, Thesaurus 1033,0=c:
                               C:\WINWORD\TH_AM.DLL,
                               C:\WINWORD\TH_AM.LEX

Grammar language,type=         Specifies the drive and directory
                               where added grammar tools may be
                               stored. For example, 1033,0=c:\WINWORD
                               \GRAMMAR.DLL, c:\WINWORD\GR_AM.LEX

Doc-extension=                 Specifies the default filename
                               extension for Word documents.
                               For example, Doc-extension=.DOC.

Dot-extension=                 Allows you to set the default
                               filename extension if you save a
                               template file. For example,
                               Dot-extension=.DOT.

Dot-Path=                      Tells Word for Windows where to locate
                               document templates. Note this setting
                               also includes the NORMAL.DOT file. For
                               example, Dot-Path=C:\WINWORD

Ini-Path=                      Tells Word for Windows where to locate
                               the WINWORD.INI file. For example,
                               Ini-Path=C:\WINWORD

Autosave-path=                 Specifies the directory where autosave
                               files are stored. For example,
                               Autosave-Path=C:\BACKUP. This entry has
                               precedence over Tools-path=.

Tools-path=                    Sets alternative locations for
                               proofing tools, file converters,
                               graphic filters, autosave files, and
                               user dictionaries. For example,
                               Tools-Path=C:\WINWORD

Bak-extension=                 Allows you to set an alternative
                               extension for backup files created
                               with Word for Windows. For example,
                               Bak-Extension=.bak

DateFormat=                    Allows you to set a default date
                               format. For example,
                               DateFormat=dd/mm/yy

TimeFormat=                    Allows you to set a default time
                               format. For example,
                               TimeFormat=hh:mm:sss

Bitmapmemory=                  Allows you to set the amount of memory
                               (in kilobytes) you want to reserve for
                               caching graphics in a document. For
                               example, Bitmapmemory=1024

CacheSize=                     Allows a portion of a document to be
                               loaded into memory. For example,
                               CacheSize=512. The default size is 512K.

DDETimeout=                    Allows you to set the time in seconds
                               that Word for Windows waits for a DDE
                               message from another DDE application.
                               For example, DDETimeout=60

NovellNet=Yes                  Use this setting if you are running
                               Word for Windows on a network. This
                               setting assists in checking certain
                               directories for rights and allows you
                               to navigate through directories that
                               you may not have rights in.

AskForPrinterPicture=1         Allows Word for Windows to display a
                               picture in color if transferred from
                               Excel to Word for Windows through the
                               Clipboard. If this option is set to No,
                               graphics transferred from Excel through
                               the Clipboard appear black and white.

UnderlineMode=1                Use this setting if you have difficulty
                               printing text with underline attributes.
                               Some printers cannot print underline
                               without this switch.

SlowShading=Yes                This setting allows you to shade
                               graphics by overriding a special
                               drawing function on some Hewlett-
                               Packard printers. Using this option
                               slows printing. If a printer does not
                               support this special drawing function,
                               the switch has no effect.

SuppressTopSpacing=yes         This setting forces the first line at
                               the top of all pages to be single-
                               spaced, regardless of the spacing set
                               for the current paragraph.

                               Note: A setting made from the Format
                               Paragraph Spacing menu option takes
                               precedence over a SupressTopSpacing setting.

NoOwnerFiles=yes               This setting prevents the creation of
                               hidden files specifying who has a file
                               open.

NoFileCache=yes                This setting removes the "most recently
                               used" (MRU) file listing from the File
                                menu.

NetworkButtons=yes             Turns on the Network boxes in certain
                               dialog boxes.

                               For more information on the network
