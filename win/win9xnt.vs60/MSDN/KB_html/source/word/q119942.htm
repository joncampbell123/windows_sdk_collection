The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for the Macintosh, version 6.0, 6.0.1
<LI>Microsoft Word 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Word for the Macintosh, if you create and save a document in Stationery
file format, Word for the Macintosh retains the stationery file name in the
document based on the stationery. If you save the document again without
changing the file name, the Word document overwrites the stationery file.
<P>
This behavior differs from that of earlier versions of Word for the
Macintosh, in which Word changes the default file name of the document 
based on a newly saved stationery. Word does not prompt or warn you that it 
is overwriting the stationery file format with Word document format.
<P>
This does not happen if you first close the stationery file before using it
to create a new document in Word.
<P>
NOTE: Stationery is a special form of a document that you can use
repeatedly as a master for similar documents. When a file is in stationery
pad format, you cannot modify it. When you open a stationery pad, a new,
untitled document appears that contains the text, styles, and other
formatting of the stationery pad. The stationery pad itself does not open,
so you cannot modify it.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
By design, Word for the Macintosh uses the same file name for both the Word
document based on the stationery and the open, newly created stationery
file itself. As a result, the new Word document overwrites the stationery
file if you do not use the Save As command on the File menu to change the
file name.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To use a newly created stationery sheet, you must first close the
stationery and then reopen it. When you do this, Word opens a new document,
named DocumentX, that contains the text, styles, and other formats of the
stationery (unlike a Word template, the stationery doesn't store macros,
command settings, or AutoText entries). When you save DocumentX, it does
not overwrite the stationery file.
