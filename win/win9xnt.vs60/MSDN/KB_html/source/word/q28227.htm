The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for the Macintosh, versions 3.0, 3.01, 3.02, 4.0,
   5.0, 5.1, 5.1a, 6.0, 6.0.1, 6.0.1a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you attempt to perform a mail merge (or, "print merge," as it was
previously called) in Word, the data document or main document prints out
exactly as it appears on the screen. That is, the field information is not
substituted with data.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Word 6.x</h3>
 
<P>
Be sure the special characters used to create a merge field were inserted
correctly. In Word 6.0, merge fields are field codes and must be inserted
by either choosing the Insert Merge Field button, or inserting a MERGEFIELD
field by pressing COMMAND+F9, typing MERGEFIELD and the name of the field.
For example a field code for a field called firstname in Word 6.0 is would
look as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   {MERGEFIELD firstname}

</PRE>The braces were produced by pressing COMMAND+F9.
<P>
<P><h3>Word 3.x, 4.0, 5.x</h3>
 
<P>
In Word versions 3.x-5.x, check the following:

<UL><LI>If the main document when printed out includes the merge codes (just
   as it looks on screen), you probably chose Print instead of Print
   Merge. On the File menu, click Print Merge.

<LI>If the data document printed out, activate the main document (which
   begins with "&lt;&lt;data filename&gt;&gt;") and then click Print Merge on
   the File menu again. The main document must be active to perform the
   print merge properly.

<LI>Be sure that the special characters &lt;&lt; and &gt;&gt; are created by
   using the OPTION+\ and SHIFT+OPTION+\ key combinations, not by
   typing the greater-than and less-than characters.
<P></UL>
