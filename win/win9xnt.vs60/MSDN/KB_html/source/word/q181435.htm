The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Some graphics programs may not appear in the Picture Editor list;
therefore, you cannot select them as the default program for editing
imported graphics in Microsoft Word for Windows. (To display the Picture
Editor list, click Options on the Tools menu and click the Edit tab.)
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Word for Windows lists a graphics application in the Picture Editor list
only if the if the registration information has been written to the Windows
registry.
<P>
If a graphics program does not add both of the registration settings to
Reg.dat, Word does not list the program in the Picture Editor list. These
settings tell Word that the graphics program can edit metafiles as OLE
objects.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft does not recommend that you manually edit your Reg.dat file to
add these missing registration settings. (If you add the settings, the
application appears in the Picture Editor list, but you may be unable to
edit the drawing in the graphics application.) The graphics application
must register this information when you install it.
<P>
If you want to select an unlisted graphics application as your default
picture editor in Word, first reinstall the software. If this workaround is
unsuccessful, contact the manufacturer of the graphics application for
instructions on how to successfully install and register their application
in Windows 95 to work with Word 97.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To change the default program for editing imported graphics, follow these
steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Options, and then click the Edit tab.

<P><LI>In the Picture editor box, click the program you want to use to modify
   imported graphics, and then OK.
