The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 6.0, 6.0a
<LI>Word for the Macintosh, versions 6.0, 6.0.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
You may unintentionally delete more than one space when you run a macro
such as the following that includes the EditClear statement.
<P>
<PRE>Sub Main
  EditClear
End Sub

</PRE>Even when a count of 1 is included in the statement, as in the following
example, Word may ignore the count and delete multiple spaces.
<P>
<PRE>Sub Main
  EditClear 1
End Sub

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when you have the "Use Smart Cut and Paste" option
turned on and any of the following conditions occur:

<UL><LI>The insertion point follows certain characters, such as opening or
   closing parentheses, opening or closing quotation marks, or opening
   bracket.

<LI>The insertion point precedes two or more spaces.

<LI>No text is selected.
<P>
</UL>When the insertion point follows other types of punctuation (such as the
opening or closing brace), or if one character space is selected following
this punctuation, only one character is deleted.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To delete a single space from a series of spaces, use Clear from the Edit
Menu. If you prefer to use a macro, clear the "Use Smart Cut and Paste"
check box before running the macro. (To locate this option, choose Options
from the Tools menu, select the Edit tab.)
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
EditClear is a WordBasic statement that deletes the current selection or
one or more characters to the right of the insertion point. When included
in a macro, it may include an argument called Count to delete a specified
number of characters. When run from the Edit menu, Clear is used to delete
the current selection or the character to the right of the insertion point.
EditClear deletes text without changing the contents of the Clipboard.
