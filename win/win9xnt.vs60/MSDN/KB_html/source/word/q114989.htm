2.x 6.00 6.00a 6.00c
WINDOWS
kbmm
<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 2.0, 2.0a, 2.0a-CD, 2.0b, 2.0c,
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
<LI>Microsoft Bookshelf for Windows, 1994 edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you install Microsoft Bookshelf 1994 and choose to integrate it with
Word for Windows, no Bookshelf toolbar button appears in Word.
<P>
NOTE: Microsoft Bookshelf for Windows, 1994 Edition, does not integrate
with Microsoft Word for Windows 95, versions 7.0 or later. Bookshelf 1994
is a 16-bit application and is not supported with 32-bit applications.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
By design, Bookshelf 1994 does not add the Bookshelf toolbar in Word. When
you integrate Bookshelf 1994 with Word for Windows, Bookshelf Setup adds
the "Quote of the Day" command to the View menu in Word and the "Copy to
Word" command to the Edit menu in Bookshelf. For Word 6.0, Bookshelf Setup
copies the Bshelf94.dot template to your Word STARTUP subdirectory (usually
Winword\Startup). For Word 2.x, Bookshelf Setup places the "Quote of the
Day" macros in your Normal.dot file.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1</h3>
 
<P>
To start Bookshelf 1994 from Word, use the Quickshelf toolbar.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 2</h3>
 
<P>
Create the following WordBasic macro and assign it to a toolbar button in
Word. This macro uses the Shell statement to launch Bookshelf 1994 from
Word.
<P>
WARNING: ANY USE BY YOU OF THE CODE PROVIDED IN THIS ARTICLE IS AT YOUR OWN
RISK. Microsoft provides this macro code "as is" without warranty of any
kind, either express or implied, including but not limited to the implied
warranties of merchantability and/or fitness for a particular purpose.
<P>
<PRE>   Sub MAIN
      Shell "C:\BOOKS94\BS94.EXE"
   End Sub

</PRE>NOTE: This macro assumes that Bookshelf 1994 is installed in the C:\Books94
directory on your computer. Modify the macro accordingly if you installed
Bookshelf 1994 somewhere else on your computer.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Below are excerpts from the Bookshelf 1994 Readme.txt that describe how to
integrate Bookshelf 1994 with Word.
<P>
NOTE: The description of the WabSetup macro in Bshelf94.dot contains the
following incorrect information:
<P>
<PRE>   Copies Word &amp; Bookshelf macros to Normal.dot, adds the Bookshelf button
   to the Toolbar, and adds a few commands to menus.

</PRE>Bookshelf copies macros to Normal.dot only if you are running Word 2.x, not
if you are running Word 6.0. Furthermore, the macro does not add the
Bookshelf button to the toolbar, regardless of which Word version you are
running.
<P>
 
<P><h2>BOOKSHELF AND WORD FOR WINDOWS INTEGRATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Setup Issues</h3>
 
<P>
During Setup, you will be given the option of installing the feature that
integrates Bookshelf and Word for Windows if your system meets the
following conditions:

<UL><LI>A non-network version of Word for Windows, version 2.x or 6.0, is
   installed.
<P>
</UL>For Word for Windows 2.x:

<UL><LI>Your Win.ini file contains a [Microsoft Word 2.0] section that includes
   a programdir={path} line and specifies a valid Winword.exe file.
<P>
</UL>For Word for Windows 6.0:

<UL><LI>Your Win.ini file contains a [MS Setup (ACME) Table Files] section that
   includes a Winword.exe@V6...={path}\Setup\Setup.exe line and specifies a
   valid Winword.exe file.

<LI>Your hard drive has enough space to support this feature.
<P>
</UL>If you install the integration feature, the Setup program modifies
Normal.dot, the global document template for Word 2.x, to customize the
Word Toolbar and menus. Changes you have made to the Toolbar, to the
default menus, and so on, are preserved.
<P>
The integration feature adds these features to Bookshelf and Word:

<UL><LI>The "Quote of the Day" command on the Word View menu.

<LI>The "Copy to Word" command on the Bookshelf Edit menu.
<P>
</UL>To send a topic from Bookshelf to Word, choose the "Copy to Word" command
from the Edit menu. Detailed information on copying to Word is available
from Bookshelf Help.
<P>
<P><h3>Manual Integration of Bookshelf with Word 6.0 for Windows</h3>
 
<P>
The following directions assume your hard disk drive is drive C, that
Bookshelf is installed in C:\BOOKS94, Windows is installed in C:\Windows,
Word for Windows 6.0 is installed in C:\Winword and that your CD-ROM drive
is drive X.
<P>
To manually integrate Bookshelf with Word 6.0 for Windows:

<OL><P><LI>Copy x:\Word\Bshelf94.dot to C:\Winword\Startup.

<P><LI>Copy x:\Word\Bookshlf.dll to C:\Windows\System.

<P><LI>Copy X:\Word\Bsword.hlp to C:\Books94.

<P><LI>After copying these files to the hard drive, remove the Read Only
   attribute. To remove the Read Only attribute:
<P>
   a. In the Main Window of Windows Program Manager, open File Manager.
<P>
   b. In the C:\Winword\Startup directory, select the Bshelf94.dot file.
<P>
   c. From the File menu, choose Properties.
<P>
   d. In the Attributes section, clear the Read Only check box.
<P>
   e. Choose OK.
<P>
   f. Repeat steps a through e for Bookshlf.dll and Bsword.hlp.

<P><LI>Use Notepad or any other text editor to add the following entries to the
   [Bookshelf] section of the Win.ini file:
<P>
<P><PRE>      [Bookshelf]
      integration=2
      LastQuote=1
      BSWordHelp=C:\BOOKS94\BSWORD.HLP
</PRE><P>
</OL>Integration of Bookshelf 1994 and Word for Windows 6.0 is now complete.
