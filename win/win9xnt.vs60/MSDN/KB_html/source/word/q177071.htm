The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft PowerPoint 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you close a document and then quit Microsoft Word, you may receive the
following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down.
   If the problem persists, contact the program vendor.

   If you click Details, you receive the following message:

   WINWORD caused an invalid page fault in module WINWORD.EXE.

</PRE>If you close a Microsoft PowerPoint presentation and then quit Microsoft
PowerPoint, you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   PowerPoint encountered an error that it could not correct.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The problem occurs if both of the following are true:
<P>
The file properties keywords contain more than 255 characters.
<P>
-and-
<P>
Journaling of Microsoft Word or Microsoft PowerPoint is enabled in
Microsoft Outlook.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Use one of the following methods to work around the problem.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1: Reduce the Length of the Keywords</h3>
 
<P>
The problem occurs only if the file keywords contain more than 255
characters. If you delete or shorten the document keywords so that they
contain fewer than 255 characters, the problem will not occur.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 2: Disable Outlook Journaling of Word or PowerPoint</h3>
 
<P>
Outlook journaling is a feature in Microsoft Outlook that tracks and
records when files are opened, closed, or modified. If you disable this
feature for Microsoft Word and Microsoft PowerPoint, the problem will no
longer occur on that particular computer. To disable Outlook journaling for
Microsoft Word or Microsoft PowerPoint, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Start Microsoft Outlook.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Options.

<P><LI>Click the Journal tab.

<P><LI>Click to clear the "Always record files from Microsoft Word" or the
   "Always record files from Microsoft PowerPoint" check boxes, and then
   click OK.

<P><LI>Quit and then restart Microsoft Outlook.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: When working with a file that is opened by multiple users, Outlook
journaling needs to be disabled on each workstation that is opening the
file.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this
problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This problem does not occur with other file properties because they will
only accept a maximum of 255 characters.
<P>
This problem does not occur in Microsoft Excel because Microsoft Excel does
not support journaling for the keyword strings.
<P>
