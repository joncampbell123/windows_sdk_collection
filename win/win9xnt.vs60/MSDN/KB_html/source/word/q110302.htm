<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes the Microsoft workgroup templates and provides
information on the templates that are pertinent to Word for Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
General Information
 
<P>
The Microsoft Workgroup templates are a set of templates that give examples
and information on using Microsoft applications with the Messaging
Application Programming Interface (MAPI) DLL. Applications that allow use
of the MAPI DLL include Microsoft Mail and Schedule Plus.
<P>
These templates are examples, intended as a starting point for building new
applications that integrate desktop applications and tools with database,
messaging, and scheduling services. They employ combinations of
applications such as Microsoft Word, Excel, and Project; and development
tools such as Microsoft Access, Visual Basic, and Microsoft Electronic
Forms Designer.
<P>
The workgroup templates use Microsoft Mail for messaging services, Access's
database engine for database services, and Schedule+ for scheduling
services. To access these services, the templates use MAPI, the Open
Database Connectivity (ODBC) API, and the Schedule+ Libraries API.
<P>
The templates come with a developer's handbook, explaining how each
template works and how to install and configure the templates for users.
<P>
The templates also come with workgroup extensions toolkits for adding
workgroup functionality to the macro languages of Microsoft Word, Microsoft
Excel, Microsoft Project, and Microsoft FoxPro.
<P>
The package contains templates for several Microsoft applications and
several functions as is listed below.

</PRE><h3>Word for Windows Issues</h3>
 
<P>
End-user support for the Report Consolidation templates is the same as with
the standard shipped templates. It is limited to installation and usage
help. Modifications to the templates are not part of standard end-user
support.

<P><h3>Description of the Templates That Are Specific to Word for Windows</h3>
 
<P>
The Report Consolidation templates are the two examples designed for
Microsoft Word 2.0. They are named REPTCON.DOT and REPTCON1.DOT and are
located in the REPORT subdirectory.
<P>
With the Report Consolidation template, a document owner creates a report
by assigning different sections to document contributors and then
consolidating the sections as contributors return them.
<P>
The document owner first creates a master document, which organizes the
sections of the report, then defines the section documents and distributes
them to contributors through Microsoft Mail. In turn, document contributors
complete drafts of their sections and return them to the document owner
through Mail. Finally, the owner accepts the returned sections and updates
the master document.
<P>
Since each section remains a separate document, the template also includes
macros to number the pages of the sections, generate a table of contents,
and print the complete report.
<P>
The other Word for Windows specific part of this package are the Workgroup
Extensions for Microsoft Word. This DLL and template provide functions that
mirror MAPI functions. Since WordBasic cannot directly manipulate MAPI data
types such as messages or recipient lists, the MAPI data types are managed
by the WBMAPI.DLL library. The library, in turn, provides WordBasic handles
to the MAPI data types. A template included in the toolkit, WBMAPI.DOT,
provides WordBasic examples using the WBMAPI.DLL.
