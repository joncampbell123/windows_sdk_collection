<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a, 2.0, 2.0a,

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Compare Versions option in Word for Windows requires that the later of
the two documents to be compared be open and the earlier be closed. Word
compares the document in memory against the document on disk and notes
additions and changes to the new document. Paragraphs that have been
added or modified are indicated by change bars located on the left
margin.
<P>
For example, if the file on drive C is version 1 and the file on drive
A is version 2, the file on drive A must be open to make the
comparison.
<P>
In Word version 6.0 the Compare Versions button is found by selecting the
Tools menu and choosing Revisions. In Word versions 2.x, Compare Versions
command in located on the Tools menu. In Word versions 1.x Compare Versions
is found on the Utilities menu.
<P>
Compare Versions is based on the paragraph's textual content only, and
therefore does NOT reflect the following changes:

<OL><P><LI>Entire paragraphs that have been moved, copied, pasted, or deleted

<P><LI>Paragraphs that have only formatting changes
<P>
</OL>If a text change is made in a paragraph, Word version 6.0 marks only the
changes as a revision. Word version 2.x and prior mark the entire paragraph
as a revision.
