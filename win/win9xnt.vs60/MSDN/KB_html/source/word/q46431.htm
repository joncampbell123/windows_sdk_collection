The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for the Macintosh versions 3.0 3.01, 3.02, and 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Including the MS Dictionary (Main Dictionary for Word versions 3.0x),
you can have as many as five dictionaries open at one time for
checking the spelling in a document.
<P>
You can open or close user dictionaries in both versions from the
Spelling dialog box by using the Open and Close commands from the File
menu. You can also create a new user dictionary by choosing New from
the File menu while the Spelling dialog box is open.
<P>
Word 4.0 will store the name and location of up to three user
dictionaries in the current configuration file. However, Word 3.0x
automatically opens a user dictionary only if the user dictionary is
called "User 1" and is located in the same folder as the Word program.
Hence, Word 3.0x will store and automatically open only this one user
dictionary.
<P>
The number of dictionaries allowed open in version 5.0 of Word is
limited by allocated memory.
