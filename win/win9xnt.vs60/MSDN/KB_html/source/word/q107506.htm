The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
<LI>Microsoft Word for the Macintosh, versions 6.0, 6.0.1, 6.0.1a

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the Registry.
Before you edit the Registry, you should first make a backup copy of the
Registry files (System.dat and User.dat). Both are hidden files in the
Windows folder.
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Word 97, 7.0</h3>
 
<P>
When you double-click the MathType icon or MathType object in a Word
document, Equation Editor runs instead of MathType.
<P>
MathType 3.0 Equation is not available to select from the Object dialog box
(Insert menu) in Word.
<P>
Math Type version 3.0 is a third-party application, by Design Science,
Inc., that you can purchase separately for use with Word.
<P>
<P><h3>Word 6.0 (Windows and Macintosh)</h3>
 
<P>
If you select MathType 3.0 Equation in the Insert Object dialog box,
Microsoft Equation Editor version 2.0 may run instead of MathType version
3.0.
<P>
When you open a document that contains MathType objects, the objects are
automatically converted to Equation Editor objects.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
You are using MathType (version 3.0 through 3.0e) which may not be
registered as the default equation editor in the Registry (Windows 95) or
the Reg.dat (Windows 3.x) file. This problem typically occurs when you
install Equation Editor during a complete/custom installation of Word.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Design Science has confirmed this to be a problem with MathType 3.0. This
problem has been corrected in MathType, version 3.1.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>All versions of Word, Windows and Macintosh platforms</h3>
 
<P>
Upgrade to MathType version 3.1. For more information, contact MathType
technical support via one of the following methods:

</PRE>To convert equations from Equation Editor objects into MathType equations,
do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Start MathType and Word.

<P><LI>In Word, open the document that contains your equations.

<P><LI>Select an equation, and then click Cut on the Edit menu.

<P><LI>Switch to the MathType window, and then click Paste on the Edit menu.

<P><LI>Select the equation and then click Copy on the Edit menu.

<P><LI>Switch to Word and then choose Paste on the Edit menu.

<P><LI>Repeat steps 3-6 for each equation in the document.
<P>
</OL><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around the problem, choose one of the following methods.
<P>
<P><h3>Word 97, 7.0</h3>
 
<P>
Method 1: Update the Registry by rerunning the MathType setup program and
<PRE>          then do the following:

          a. Choose Custom Installation.

          b. Select the MathType's OLE Registration option, and then click
             OK.

          Note: Do not install the WordBasic Macros included with MathType.
          They were designed for use with Word for Windows 2.0 and do not
          work correctly in either Word for Windows version 6.0 or Word for
          Windows 95.

</PRE></OL>Method 2. If you tried method 1 and Equation Editor still runs instead of
<PRE>          MathType, make the following modifications manually:

          a. Modify the Win.ini. To do this,

             1) On the Start button click Run. Type "Sysedit" (without the
                quotation marks) in the Open box, and then click OK.

             2) In the Win.ini file locate the [Embedding] section.

             3) Comment all lines in this section that begin with Equation.
                To do this, type a semicolon before each line that begins
                with the word, "Equation."

             4) Save and exit System Configuration Editor.

          b. Modify the Registry.

          WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious
          problems that may require you to reinstall Windows 95 or Windows
          NT. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the
          incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry
          Editor at your own risk.

          For information about how to edit the Registry, view the Changing
          Keys And Values online Help topic in Registry Editor
          (Regedit.exe). Note that you should make a backup copy of the
          Registry files (System.dat and User.dat) before you edit the
          Registry.

             1) Quit all programs.

             2) Click the Start button on the taskbar, and then click Run.

             3) In the Open box, type "regedit" (without the quotation
                marks), and then click OK.

             4) Locate and double-click the following Registry key:
                Hkey_Classes_Root\Equation.2

             5) On the Registry menu, click Export Registry File, type a
                file name, and then click Save.

             6) Double-click the Default key, type "MathType Equation"
                (without the quotation marks) in the Value Data box, and
                then click OK.

             7) Locate and double-click the following Registry key:

 Hkey_Classes_Root\Equation.2\Protocol\StdFileEditing\Server

             8) Double-click the Default key, type the complete path
                including the application name, Mathtype.exe, and then
                click OK.

             9) Locate and double-click the following Registry key:

                Hkey_Classes_Root\Equation.2\Protocol\Stdexecute\Server

            10) Double-click the Default key, type the complete path
                including the application name, Mathtype.exe, and then
                click OK.

            11) Locate and double-click the following Registry key:

                Hkey_Classes_Root\Equation.2\Shell\Open\Command

            12) Double-click the Default key, type the complete path
                including the application name, Mathtype.exe, and then
                click OK.

            13) Close the Registry.

</PRE><h3>Word 6.0 (Windows)</h3>
 
<P>
To run both Equation Editor and Math Type from Word, you must modify your
Windows Reg.dat file using the following procedure:
<P>
NOTE: Before beginning these steps, you should quit Windows and make a
backup copy of your Reg.dat file, which is located in the Windows folder.

<OL><P><LI>Quit Word.

<P><LI>In Windows Program Manager, choose Run from the File menu.

<P><LI>In the Command Line box, type "regedit /v" (without the quotation
    marks) and then choose OK. This starts Microsoft  Windows Registration
    Editor.

<P><LI>In Registration Editor, choose Find Key from the Search menu.

<P><LI>In the Find What box, type the following string exactly and  then
    choose the Find Next button:
<P>
       \CLSID\{0003000B-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}\AutoConvertTo
<P>
    IMPORTANT: There are no spaces in this line.

<P><LI>The following line is now selected in Registration Editor:
<P>
       AutoConvertTo = {00021700-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}

<P><LI>From the Edit menu, choose Delete Key. Choose OK in the Delete Key
    dialog box to confirm the deletion.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Save Changes.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Exit.

<P><LI>Exit and restart Windows.
<P>
</OL>Next time you select Math Type 3.0 Equation in the Insert Object dialog box
in Word, Math Type version 3.0 launches instead of Equation Editor version
2.0.
<P>
<P><h3>Word 6.0 (Macintosh)</h3>
 
<P>
Uninstall Equation Editor. To do this,

<OL><P><LI>Rerun Microsoft Word setup in maintenance mode.

<P><LI>Click the Add/Remove button.

<P><LI>In the List of Installed Components, select Equation Editor, and then
