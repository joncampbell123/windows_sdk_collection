6.00 6.00a
WINDOWS
<PRE> 

</PRE> 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 6.0, 6.0a
<LI>Microsoft Equation Editor, versions 2.0, 2.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you use the Word 6.0a for Windows Patch to upgrade from Word 6.0 to Word
6.0a, and you then use the Word 6.0 Setup program to remove Microsoft
Equation Editor, Setup does not remove the Equation Editor files. Setup
does, however, remove the Equation Editor entries from your Windows
Registration database (REG.DAT). As a result, Equation Editor no longer
appears in your Insert Object dialog box, even though the files are still
located in the &lt;WINDOWS&gt;\MSAPPS subdirectory.
<P>
NOTE: This only happens when you use the Word 6.0a Patch to upgrade to Word
6.0a. It does not happen if you run Setup using the full Word 6.0a disk
set.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Word 6.0a Patch upgrades your Equation Editor 2.0 installation to
Equation Editor 2.0a. By design, the Word Setup program never uninstalls a
component that it did not install or that it cannot reinstall. In this
case, the Equation Editor 2.0a files have a file date later than the files
shipped with Word 6.0, so the Word 6.0 Setup program cannot remove Equation
editor 2.0a.
<P>
Even though Setup cannot remove the Equation Editor 2.0a files from your
computer, it does remove the Equation Editor registration from your REG.DAT
file. As a result, Setup disables Equation Editor 2.0a, even though it does
not remove the files.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To completely remove the Equation Editor after you use Word Setup to
uninstall the application, delete the &lt;WINDOWS&gt;\MSAPPS\EQNEDIT subdirectory
(where &lt;WINDOWS&gt; is your Windows program directory).
<P>
Later, if you want to reinstall Equation Editor, use Word 6.0 Setup to add
Equation Editor 2.0, then rerun the Word 6.0a Patch to upgrade to Equation
Editor 2.0a.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Word Setup does not remove a component that it did not install; this
includes a later version of an installed component, such as Equation Editor
2.0a. This prevents Setup from removing a later version of a shared
application that you installed as part of a different Microsoft application
such as Microsoft PowerPoint 4.0.
<P>
When you uninstall Equation Editor using Word 6.0 Setup, Setup removes the
following line from your REG.DAT file (this line comes from the
EQNEDIT2.REG file):
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{00021700-0000-0000-C000-
   000000000046}\Conversion\Readwriteable\Main = Equation,1
