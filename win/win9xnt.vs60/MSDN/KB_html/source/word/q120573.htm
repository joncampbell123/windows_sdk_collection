<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Word 6.0c for Windows was created primarily to provide support for Lotus
Notes Field Exchange (FX); however, a few problems were also corrected or
addressed. This article describes the new Lotus Notes/FX support and
problems in Word versions 6.0 and 6.0a for Windows that are corrected in

<P><h2>WORD 6.0C: NEW FEATURES</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Support for Lotus Notes Field Exchange (FX)</h3>
 
<P>
Word 6.0c supports Lotus Notes/FX and includes extensive online Help about
this new functionality.
<P>
If Lotus Notes version 3.0 is installed on your computer, the Word Setup
program modifies your Notes configuration so Notes can open Word documents.
With Word 6.0c, you can import a Word document into Lotus Notes, and you
can also export Lotus Notes text in Microsoft Word Rich Text Format (RTF).
<P>
Once you embed a Word document in a Lotus Notes form, you can display
predefined Word fields. Most of the predefined Word fields that Lotus Notes
can display are found in the summary information for the Word document. For
example, you can create fields within a Lotus Notes form that display the
title and author of the Word document.
<P>
You can also create Word bookmarks that Lotus Notes can use as fields. For
example, you can define a bookmark that marks some important text in your
Word document. Give the bookmark a name using prop_ as a prefix and then
use the bookmark name (without the prefix) as a field in a Lotus Notes form
or views of the form. The bookmarked text now appears in Lotus Notes
without opening the Word document object. If you change the text in either
the Word object or Lotus Notes, the change will be reflected in both
applications. In other words, changes in Word are reflected in the Lotus
Notes field and changes in Lotus Notes field are reflected in the embedded
Word object.
<P>
For more information about using Lotus Notes with Word 6.0c double-click
the Help button on the Standard toolbar, and then type "lotus notes"
(without the quotation marks).
<P>
<P><h2>WORD 6.0 AND 6.0A PROBLEMS CORRECTED IN WORD 6.0C</h2>
 

<OL><P><LI>Some master document problems corrected (includes updated online Help)
<P>
   Due to a Windows system limitation, in Word 6.0 or 6.0a, when you save a
   master document that contains many (usually around 30 or more)
   subdocuments, one of the following error messages may occur:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Word cannot save or create this file. Make sure the disk is not
      write protected.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       -or-
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      The disk is full or too many files are open.
</PRE><P>
   The File Save operation fails when the supply of available Windows file
   handles is exhausted. As a safeguard, Word temporarily renames your
   documents with temporary filenames during the save operation. Normally,
   the temporary files are then properly renamed back to the original
   document names once the save operation is complete. When the File Save
   operation fails due to a lack of Windows file handles, however, one or
   more of the subdocument temporary files may not get renamed to the
   original document name. While the subdocument still exists as a
   temporary file, it appears to be deleted because Word cannot locate it.
<P>
   IMPORTANT: This problem occurs due to a Windows system file handle
   limitation. This problem may not occur in Word 6.0 for other operating
   systems, such as Word 6.0 for the Macintosh.
<P>
   Word 6.0c partially fixes this problem. In Word 6.0c for Windows, a
   master document may still exhaust the supply of available Windows file
   handles. However, when you save, Word 6.0c checks the number of
   available file handles as it performs the save and displays an error
   message if it cannot save the next subdocument due to insufficient
   available file handles. Word then asks if you want to collapse some of
   the subdocuments into the master document. (This is the same as choosing
   the Remove Subdocument button on the Master Document toolbar.) If you
   choose Yes, Word collapses subdocuments into the master document until
   enough file handles are available to save the master document and the
   remaining subdocuments. By moving the contents of some subdocuments to
   the master document, Word prevents the appearance of data loss that may
   occur in Word 6.0 and 6.0a.
<P>
   Word collapses subdocuments in the following order:
<P>
<P><PRE>    1. Word removes the most deeply nested subdocuments first.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    2. Word starts removing subdocuments at the end of the master document
       and  works upward to the beginning.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    3. Word removes unsaved subdocuments or subdocuments whose file handles
       are only referenced first by the subdocument.
</PRE><P>
   Note: If Word 6.0c cannot remove enough subdocuments to successfully
   save the document, the save operation fails.
<P>
   Documentation Error: Page 534 of the Word for Windows "User's Guide"
   incorrectly states that the maximum number of subdocuments is 80. For
   most systems and most master documents, this maximum is closer to 30
   subdocuments, depending on both the state of the system at the time and
   the complexity of the document.
<P>

</PRE><P><LI>Word 2.x letter templates updated and improved for Word 6.0
<P>
   Word 6.0c includes some of the templates supplied with Word 2.x,
   converted to Word 6.0 format. These converted letter and memo templates
   run without the known errors that occur when you run the unconverted
   Word 2.x templates in Word 6.0. They use the address lists and other
   custom settings you created in Word 2.x by copying them from the Word
   2.x templates into the updated Word 6.0 templates. Below are the names
   of the converted Word 2.x templates supplied with Word 6.0c:

   Note: An Application Note is available from Microsoft Product Support
   Services (PSS) that contains all the converted Word 2.x templates. In
   addition to the five templates listed above, the "WD0264: Updated Word
   2.x Templates for Use with Word 6.0" Application Note contains the
   ARTICLE2.DOT, DISSERT2.DOT, FAX.DOT, PRESS.DOT, PROPOSAL.DOT,
   REPLAND.DOT, REPSIDE.DOT, REPSTAND.DOT, and TERM2.DOT templates. For

<P>
   In Word 6.0 and 6.0a for Windows, if you open a Word 6.0 for the
   Macintosh document that contains a graphic, the following message
   appears in place of the image:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Use Word 6.0c or later to view Macintosh picture.
</PRE><P>
   Word version 6.0 and 6.0a for Windows can neither display nor print a
   PICT graphic in a converted Word 6.0 for the Macintosh document. Word
   version 6.0c correctly displays and prints PICT graphics.

</PRE><P><LI>WordBasic Errors in Word for the Macintosh Running Word for the
   Macintosh Macro that Has Been Edited in Word for Windows
<P>
   The following problem is partially fixed in Word 6.0c:
<P>
   If you edit and save a cross-platform macro in Word 6.0 and 6.0a for
   Windows, Word for Windows deletes Macintosh-specific commands (such as
   MacID$) from the macro. For example, if you open and edit, then save
   changes to the following cross-platform macro in Word 6.0 or 6.0a for
   Windows,
<P>
<P><PRE>    Sub MAIN
     a$ = MacID$("TEXT")
    End Sub
</PRE><P>
   the macro appears as shown below when you open it in Word for the
   Macintosh (notice that the Macintosh-specific MacID$ command is
   missing):
<P>
<P><PRE>    Sub MAIN
     a$ = ("TEXT")
    End Sub
</PRE><P>
   In other words, Word 6.0 and 6.0a for Windows delete unknown Macintosh
   commands from your macros when you edit, or "dirty," them in Word 6.0
   and 6.0a for Windows.
<P>
   Word 6.0c does not delete unknown commands from your macros when you
   edit them. Instead of deleting the Macintosh-specific command, Word 6.0c
   replaces it with an "Unrecognized_Command" string, or token. For
   example, if you create the following macro in Word 6.0 or 6.0a for
   Windows,
<P>
<P><PRE>    Sub Main
     a$ = MacID$("TEXT")
    End Sub
</PRE><P>
   save and close the macro, and then re-open it in Word 6.0c for Windows,
   the macro will be changed to the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>    Sub Main
     a$ = Unrecognized_Statement33134("TEXT")
    End Sub
</PRE><P>
   Note: "33134" is the token identification number for the "MacID$"
   command. Word 6.0c for Windows does not automatically replace the token
   ID with the Macintosh-specific WordBasic token command. To restore the
   Macintosh token IDs so your macro will run without errors in Word for
   the Macintosh, you must "dirty" the macro in Word for the Macintosh
   (that is, you must change the macro before you run it).
<P>
   In other words, while Word 6.0c for Windows no longer deletes any
   unrecognized commands, it still does not automatically change the token
   IDs back to Macintosh-specific WordBasic commands in your macro. To work
   around this limitation when you create a cross-platform macro in Word
   6.0c for Windows, be sure to dirty the macro once in Word 6.0 for the
   Macintosh. You can then distribute your cross-platform macro, and it
   will run without missing-token errors.

<P><LI>Multiple-Page Table Rows Print Incorrectly (Display Correctly)
<P>
   The following Word 6.0 and 6.0a for Windows problem is corrected in Word
   6.0c:
<P>
   In Word 6.0 and 6.0a, text from a table row that spans a page break may
   print again in the bottom margin of the preceding page. Specifically, if
   one or more cells in a table row span a page break and if the table row
   also contains a cell on the right side of the page-spanning cell that is
   blank or does not span the page break, text from the following page
   sometimes prints in the bottom margin. For example, if cell B spans the
   page break between pages 3 and 4 and cell C is only one line long on
   page 3, the column B text at the top of page 4 also prints in the bottom
   margin of page 3.
<P>
   IMPORTANT: Word 6.0c does not address a similar problem that you can
   resolve by turning off the Background Printing option. To determine
   whether you need Word 6.0c, turn off Background Printing, and then print
   your document. If text continues to print in the bottom margin of the
   previous page, you should obtain Word 6.0c. If the problem no longer
   occurs after you turn off Background Printing, your problem is not
   addressed in Word 6.0c.
<P>
   This problem does not occur in Word 6.0 for the Macintosh.

                     compressed and larger than 500K or uncompressed
                     and smaller than 500K. The .TIF graphics filter
