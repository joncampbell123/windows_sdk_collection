This article contains the text of "File and Macro Conversions
Questions and Answers," which is available on the Microsoft FastTips
service for Word for Windows. It answers the most commonly asked
questions regarding conversions involving Word for Windows.

<PRE>1. Q. Why can't I open my Word 2.0 document in PageMaker? What should
      I try?

   A. Aldus now has Word 2.0 converters as part of their PageMaker 4.0
      Windows Filter Driver Pack. To obtain the Filter Driver Pack,
      call Aldus Sales and Service at (206) 628-2030. As a temporary
      workaround while you wait for the Filter Driver Pack, save your
      Word documents in Word for MS-DOS or WordPerfect file format,
      both of which are formats that PageMaker can read.

2. Q. I want to use my Word version 1.0 or 1.1 macros in Word version
      2.0. What do I need to do?

   A. Word 2.0 has an built-in macro converter, so it automatically
      converts any macros when you open a Word 1.0 or 1.1 template or
      attach it to a document. This means you can immediately run your
      Word 1.x macros in Word 2.0.

      If you want to save the converted macros, you must save the
      template. If you don't save the template, Word converts the
      macros again the next time you open the template.

      The macro converter may leave some lines in your macros
      unconverted or it may convert them incorrectly. This happens
      when your macro contains unusual syntax or processes. Word marks
      unconverted lines in your macro text as comments. You must
      rewrite or rerecord these portions of your macros. For more
      information on converting your Word version 1.x macros, see the
      MACROCNV.DOC file, located in your Word program directory.

3. Q. Where can I find out what features convert to and from Word
      version 2.0 file format?

   A. Word version 2.0 comes with a document named CONVINFO.DOC, which
      is located in your Word program directory. This document
      describes what conversion options and limitations you will
      encounter when you convert documents to and from other file
      formats in Word.

4. Q. I thought Word version 2.0 came with more file converters. Where
      are they?

   A. Word comes with some file converters, but the remaining
      converters are on the Supplemental Converters disk, which you
      can obtain from Microsoft at no cost. This disk contains the
      following file converters: DisplayWrite, Microsoft Multiplan,
      MultiMate, WordStar, WordPerfect 4.1 and 4.2, Microsoft Works
      for MS-DOS, Microsoft Works for Windows, and a DXF graphic
      filter.

      To obtain the Supplemental Converters Disk, send in your
      Supplemental Offers Coupon, which we included with your Word
      package, or phone Microsoft Sales Information Center at (800) 426-
      9400. If you are outside the United States, contact the Microsoft
      subsidiary for your area. To locate your subsidiary, call
      Microsoft International Customer Service at (425) 936-8661.

5. Q. Can Word version 2.0 read my Excel Spreadsheets?

   A. Yes. Word versions 2.0b and 2.0c can open Excel versions 2.1x,
      3.0, and 4.0 spreadsheets. Word versions 2.0 and 2.0a do not
      include the converter for Excel 4.0 spreadsheets. To open your
      Excel 4.0 spreadsheets in Word version 2.0 and 2.0a, save them
      in Excel 3.0 or CSV (comma-separated values) format.

      To obtain the latest version of Word for Windows, call Microsoft
      Sales Information Center at (800) 426-9400. If you are outside the
      United States, contact the Microsoft subsidiary for your area. To
      locate your subsidiary, call Microsoft International Customer
      Service at (425) 936-8661.

6. Q. I have several files to convert to Word version 2.0 for Windows.
      Do I have to convert each one individually? Can't I do them all
      at once?

   A. You can use the BatchConversion macro, supplied with Word
      version 2.0, to convert multiple files to Word file format. The
      BatchConversion macro is part of NEWMACRO.DOC, a file on your
      Word program directory. To use the BatchConversion macro, do the
      following:

      1. Open the NEWMACRO.DOC file.

      2. Select BatchConversion in the Macro Name box.

      3. Choose the Demo button if you want to run the macro without
         installing it on your hard disk.

         -or-

         Choose the Install button if you want to install the macro on
         your hard disk.
