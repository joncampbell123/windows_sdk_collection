The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Microsoft Word for the Macintosh, versions 6.0, 6.0.1, 6.0.1a
 
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Corrupted document files can cause any program to exhibit unusual
behavior. Such behavior occurs because Word bases its operation on 
incorrect information in the corrupted document.
<P>
This article provides troubleshooting procedures you can use to identify,
recover, or prevent corruption of Microsoft Word for the Macintosh
documents.
<P>
Note that after you use the following steps to recover a document, you
should save the recovered file after first ensuring that Allow Fast Saves
is not selected. (To disable the Allow Fast Saves option, click Options on
the Tools menu, select the Save tab, and clear the Allow Fast Saves check
box.)
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Identifying a Corrupted Document</h3>
 
<P>
Corrupted documents often cause Word to exhibit unusual behaviors such as 
infinite repagination, incorrect document layout and formatting, unreadable 
characters on the screen, error messages, and a system that stops 
responding when you load or view the file.
<P>
Because factors other than document corruption can cause these behaviors, 
follow these troubleshooting steps to rule out other factors:

<UL><LI>Check for similar behavior in other documents.

<LI>Check for similar behavior in other programs.

<LI>Take the file in question to another computer and attempt to duplicate
   the behavior.

<LI>Use a different printer driver and attempt to duplicate the behavior.

<LI>Rename any templates attached to the document and attempt to duplicate
   the behavior.

<LI>Start the computer again with extensions off to disable any third-party
   programs that are running (such as terminate-and-stay-resident programs
   [TSRs], font managers, and screen savers), and then attempt to duplicate
   the behavior.
<P>
</UL>If the problem occurs only with a single document after performing the
steps above, your document has probably been corrupted.
<P>
<P><h3>Correcting a Corrupted Document</h3>
 
<P>
There are several techniques you can use to try to correct a corrupted
document. Which method you use depends on the nature and severity of the
corruption and the nature of the behavior exhibited. Although many of these
methods succeed regularly, not every corrupted document can be recovered.
Keeping a backup copy of a document is the best way to ensure its recovery.
<P>
To recover a corrupted document, try each of the following methods:

<OL><P><LI>Convert the file to another format, and then convert it back to its
   native format.
<P>
   This is the easiest and most complete document recovery method; always
   try it first. Save the file in Rich Text Format (RTF), in Word 5.0, this 
   format is called "Interchange Format/RTF") file format; this format 
   preserves the formatting in your Word document. After you save the file 
   in RTF format, reopen the document in Word, and convert it from RTF. If 
   this method succeeds, Word removes the file corruption during 
   conversion. If the corruption persists after you save the file
   in RTF file format, try saving the file in the following file formats:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Other word processing formats
    - Text Only
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: Saving a file in Text Only format frequently corrects the document
   corruption problem; however, all document formatting is lost including
   graphics and field codes in Word 6.x. This method requires more
   reformatting; therefore, use it only after other file formats fail to
   correct the problem.

<P><LI>Open the damaged Word document in draft mode. Sometimes (not always, due
   to the nature of damaged documents) you can open a document successfully
   in draft mode when it will not open in other views. Once you open the
   file, you may be able to recover or repair the file.
<P>
   To switch to draft mode in Word, click Normal on the View menu, then
   click Options on the Tools menu. Click the View tab, and select
   the Draft Font option.

<P><LI>Run the following macro to turn off screen updating, open your damaged
   document, switch to draft mode, and then reactivate screen updating.
<P>
   WARNING: ANY USE BY YOU OF THE CODE PROVIDED IN THIS ARTICLE IS AT YOUR
   OWN RISK. Microsoft provides this macro code "as is" without warranty of
   any kind, either express or implied, including but not limited to the
   implied warranties of merchantability and/or fitness for a particular
   purpose.
<P>
<P><PRE>    Sub Main
       ScreenUpdating 0
       FileOpen .Name = "Filename.doc"  ' Substitute your file name.
       ToolsOptionsView .DraftFont = 1
       ScreenUpdating
    End Sub
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: In the above macro, substitute the name of your damaged document
   for the "Filename.doc" argument text.
<P>
   Using this macro may enable you to open documents that you cannot
   otherwise open due to damage that affects printer setup, page layout, or
   screen updates in Word. For example, if a Type Error occurs in Word
   before the document is opened, you may be able to avoid the Type Error
   by using the macro to open the document.

<P><LI>Copy everything except the last paragraph mark to a new document.
<P>
   Word associates a wide variety of formatting with the last paragraph
   mark, especially section and style formatting. If you copy
   everything except the last paragraph mark to a new document, the
   corruption may be left behind in the original document. In the new
   document, reapply the section or style formatting.
<P>
   NOTE: You can select everything except the last paragraph mark by
   pressing COMMAND+END, then COMMAND+SHIFT+HOME.

<P><LI>Copy the uncorrupted portions of the document to a new document.
<P>
   Sometimes you can determine the location of file corruption in your
   document. In such cases, copy everything except the corrupted portion
   to a new file, then follow these steps to reconstruct your document:
<P>
<P><PRE>    a. After you copy the uncorrupted portions of your document to a new
       file (you may not want to select the final paragraph mark of this
       selection since that paragraph may hold some incorrect information),
       save a copy of the corrupted document in Text Only format.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    b. Open the Text Only file. Copy the text from this file and paste it
       into the file that contains the uncorrupted portion of your 
       document.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    c. Reformat the sections you pasted in step b, then save the recovered
       document.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Insert the file into a blank document
<P>
   If you cannot open a file to copy all text except the final paragraph
   mark, you may be able to insert the file into a new document (which will
   give a new final paragraph mark to the file you are correcting). To do
   this, follow these steps:
<P>
<P><PRE>    a. Create a New Document based on the Normal template.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    b. On the Insert menu, click File. Select the corrupted document and
       Click OK.
</PRE><P>
