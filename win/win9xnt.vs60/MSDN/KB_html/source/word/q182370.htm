<LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Near the end of Direct Mail Manager Setup, while your system is being
updated, you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Msexch35.dll was unable to register itself in the system registry.

</PRE>When you click OK, Setup tells you that:
<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft Direct Mail Manager Setup was not completed successfully.

</PRE>Later, if you use Direct Mail Manager to try to submit a mailing service
request, you will receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Error (30000) - Error in Loading Mapi.dll

   This error occurred when attempting to connect to you mail server.
   Direct Mail Manager requires a MAPI compliant e-mail system for transfer
   of your mailing data to the mailing service.

</PRE>When you click OK, the following message will appear:
<P>
<PRE>   If you are not using a MAPI compliant e-mail system, you can manually e-
   mail your contact information (name, phone number, e-mail address),
   document &lt;file name&gt; and data file &lt;file name&gt; to &lt;mail service
   provider&gt;. Refer to help for more information.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This Setup error occurs when you have a version of Mapi.dll in your
Windows\System directory that is incompatible with Direct Mail Manager.
This can happen when you install a program that replaces the Mapi.dll that
was installed by Microsoft Outlook (from the Microsoft Office 97 Small
Business Edition CD-ROM).
