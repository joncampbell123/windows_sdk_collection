The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a, 2.0, 2.0a,

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If you are using 800x600 resolution in Windows with the Tseng
Laboratories VGA driver and you are also using a Diamond SpeedStar
video card, some portions of the screen are displayed in 640x480 VGA
resolution and other portions are displayed in 800x600 resolution.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you are using versions prior to 5.4 of Tseng Laboratories video
driver with 16 colors along with a a Speed Star Super VGA video card,
the Word for Windows ruler may be displayed in VGA mode while the rest
of the screen is displayed in 800x600 resolution.
<P>
This functionality is caused by the driver. Because Tseng Lab was
unable to write a driver that clearly supported 800x600 in 16 colors,
they created the driver with a 640x480 aspect ratio, causing the mixed
resolution problem.
<P>
This problem was corrected in version 5.4 of Tseng Lab's 256 color
video driver. To obtain this driver, call Tseng Laboratories technical
support at (215) 968-0502.
<P>
Tseng Lab's video driver is manufactured Tseng Labs, a vendor
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise,
regarding this products' performance or reliability.
