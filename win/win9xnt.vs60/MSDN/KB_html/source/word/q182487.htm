The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes three methods to create a document that, when
printed, you can fold in half to give the appearance of a book; that is,
the first page is numbered "page 1," the inside page is numbered "page 2,"
and so on.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The image below is an example of how a fold-over booklet would appear. It
is printed on regular 8.5-by-11-inch paper. Then, the pages are folded in
half to simulate a book.
<P>

</PRE><h3>Method 1: Manually Configure Document Layout</h3>
 
<P>
To set up the document and manually configure the layout, follow these
steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the File menu, click Open and open the document you want to print as
   a fold-over booklet.

<P><LI>On the Format menu, click Document and enter the following settings:
<P>
   a. Change all four margins to 0.5.
<P>
   b. In the Gutter box, type 5.5. (For a larger inside margin, enter a
<P><PRE>      larger number here.)
</PRE><P>
   c. Click the Layout tab, and under Headers And Footers, click to select
<P><PRE>      the "Different odd and even" check box.
</PRE><P>
   d. Click OK.

<P><LI>Set up the page numbers:
<P>
   a. On the View menu, click Header And Footer. Place the insertion point
<P><PRE>      in the header or the footer where you want the page numbering
      displayed.
</PRE><P>
   b. On the Header And Footer toolbar, click the Show Next button to move
<P><PRE>      to the Even Page Header or Even Page Footer.
</PRE><P>
   c. On the Header And Footer toolbar, click the Insert Page Number
<P><PRE>      button.
</PRE><P>
   d. On the Header And Footer toolbar, click the Show Previous button to
<P><PRE>      move to the Odd Page Header or Odd Page Footer.
</PRE><P>
   e. On the Formatting toolbar, click the Align Right button.
<P>
   f. On the Header and Footer toolbar, click the Insert Page Number
<P><PRE>      button.
</PRE><P>
</OL>To print the booklet with text on both sides of each page, you must send
the pages through the printer in a specific order. The first step is to
determine the number of pages needed.
<P>
Printing the Booklet:
<P>
To print the booklet, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Determine how much paper will be needed, as follows:
<P>
   a. Move to the last page of the document and click Print Preview on
<P><PRE>      the File menu. Immediately click the Close button to force Word to
      repaginate the document.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      NOTE: The lower-left corner of the window displays the number
      of the page you are looking at. Because you are on the last page,
      this is the total number of pages in the document.
</PRE><P>
   c. Divide the number of pages by four. If the answer is not an even
<P><PRE>      number, drop the remainder and add one to the final answer.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      For example, in a 10-page document:
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      10 / 4 = 2  Drop the remainder and add 1 to the answer.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       2 + 1 = 3  Three pieces of paper are needed to print the document.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      For example, in a 3-page document:
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       3 / 4 = 1  At least one piece of paper is needed for any document
<PRE></PRE>                  with four or fewer pages.

</PRE><P><LI>On the File Menu, click Print.

<P><LI>Under Paper Source, click Manual Feed in the All Pages From list.
<P>
   NOTE: The Print dialog box differs for various printer drivers
   and versions of the operating system. If you are using a version of the
   Macintosh operating system earlier than 8.0, under Paper Source, click
   Manual Feed in the "From" list.

<P><LI>Click the Print button to print the even side of the pages as follows:
<P>
   a. Feed the first sheet of paper through the printer.
<P>
   b. Take the same piece of paper and feed it through again, making sure
<P><PRE>      that the blank side of the paper is facing up, and that the edge with
      the printing is going into the printer first.
</PRE><P>
   c. Set that sheet of paper aside, and repeat steps a and b with the
<P><PRE>      next sheet of paper. Continue doing this until all the sheets have
      been used.
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: If the document contains four or fewer pages, continue on to the
   next step.
<P>
   When all the sheets of paper have gone through once, print the second-
   half of the booklet.

<P><LI>To print the opposite (odd) side of the pages, follow these steps:
<P>
   a. Starting with the last sheet to be printed, feed it into the printer
<P><PRE>      with the even-numbered page facing up, and the printed edge going
      into the printer first.
</PRE><P>
   b. Then, feed that page through again, this time with the odd-numbered
<P><PRE>      page facing up, and the printed edge going into the printer last.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Fold the document.
<P>
</OL><h3>Method 2: Linked Text Boxes</h3>
 
<P>
You may easily layout a booklet by using a new feature in Word 98 called
linked text boxes. Linked text boxes are two or more text boxes formatted
such that the text flows from one text box to the next.
<P>
You could create two text boxes per page, corresponding to each page of the
pamphlet. You can then link the text box for page 1 of the pamphlet to the
text box for page 2 of the pamphlet, and so on for each page of the
pamphlet. Once this is done, you can start typing in text box 1, and your
text will automatically flow into the correct text boxes (pamphlet pages)
as needed.
<P>
For more information about linked text boxes, click Contents And Index
on the Help menu (or on the Balloon Help menu if you are using a version of
the Macintosh operating system earlier than 8.0), click the Index button in
Word Help, type the following text
<P>
<PRE>   linked text boxes, creating

</PRE></OL>and then click Show Topics. Select the "Flow text to another part of my
document with linked text boxes" topic, and click Go To. If you are unable
to find the information you need, ask the Office Assistant.
<P>
For more general information about text boxes, please see the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

               Word 98

</PRE><h3>Method 3: Third-Party Software</h3>
 
<P>
There is one third-party program that reportedly works with Word 98
Macintosh Edition that can print a booklet.
<P>
ClickBook works with most Microsoft applications for the Macintosh. It sets
up another printer driver and reformats documents as they spool to the
printer. The actual document files aren't reformatted.
