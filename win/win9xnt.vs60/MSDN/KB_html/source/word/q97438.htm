The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, MultiMedia Edition, version 2.0a-CD
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, Video and Sound Edition, version 2.0c
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you start Word for Windows, Multimedia Edition or Video and Sound
Edition, you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Word cannot use the TOOLS-PATH specified in the WIN.INI file
   because it is not valid.

</PRE>This error message occurs if either of the following is true:

<UL><LI>The Word and Bookshelf CD-ROM is not in the CD-ROM drive when you
   start Word.
<P>
</UL>-or-

<UL><LI>The Word and Bookshelf CD-ROM is in the CD-ROM drive, but you have
   not accessed the drive since you turned on your computer or since
   you placed the CD-ROM in the drive.
<P>
</UL>These conditions cause the error because the Microsoft CD-ROM
Extensions (MSCDEX) has not yet read the CD-ROM. As a result, MSCDEX
cannot provide the information Word requests to verify the TOOLS-PATH
setting at startup.
<P>
Use one of the following workarounds to avoid this error message:
<P>
<P><h3>Workaround 1</h3>
 
<P>
Access the CD-ROM drive before you start Word. This causes MSCDEX to
become aware of the CD-ROM contents. Use one of the following methods
to access the CD-ROM drive:

<UL><LI>Method 1: Add the following two lines to the AUTOEXEC.BAT file
   before the line that starts Windows
<P>
<P><PRE>      &lt;drive1&gt;:
      &lt;drive2&gt;:
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;drive1&gt; is the drive letter of the CD-ROM drive and &lt;drive2&gt; is
   the drive letter where Windows is located. For example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      e:
      c:
</PRE><P>
   Note: This method does not work with all CD-ROM drivers currently
   available. If it does not work, use Method 2 below.
<P>
</UL>-or-

<UL><LI>Method 2: Add the following line to the AUTOEXEC.BAT file before the
   line that starts Windows
<P>
<P><PRE>      dir &lt;drive1&gt;:\ &gt; nul
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;drive1&gt; is the drive letter of the CD-ROM drive. For
   example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      dir e:\ &gt;nul
</PRE><P>
</UL>-or-

<UL><LI>Method 3: Before you start Word, open Windows File Manager and select
   the CD-ROM drive letter. This causes MSCDEX to read the CD-ROM.
<P>
</UL><h3>Workaround 2</h3>
 
<P>
Do the following to copy the online "Word User's Guide" file to the
hard disk and run it from that location instead of from the CD-ROM:

<OL><P><LI>Quit Word.

<P><LI>Copy WINWORD.HLP and WINWORD.IND from the WORD directory on the
   Word and Bookshelf CD-ROM to the Word for Windows program directory
   on the hard disk. To do this from an MS-DOS command prompt, type
   the following
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy &lt;drive1&gt;:\word\winword.hlp &lt;drive2&gt;:\winword
      copy &lt;drive1&gt;:\word\winword.ind &lt;drive2&gt;:\winword
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;drive1&gt; is the drive letter for the CD-ROM drive and
   &lt;drive2&gt; is the drive letter where Word for Windows is located. For
   example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy e:\word\winword.hlp c:\winword
      copy e:\word\winword.ind c:\winword
</PRE>
<P><LI>Remove the TOOLS-PATH line from the [Microsoft Word 2.0] section of
   your WIN.INI file. Word no longer checks the CD-ROM drive to verify
   the TOOLS-PATH, so the error message no longer occurs.

<P><LI>Restart Word. When you choose Word User's Guide from the Help menu,
   Word uses the User's Guide file from the hard disk instead of from
   the CD-ROM.
<P>
</OL><h3>Workaround 3</h3>
 
<P>
Do the following to copy the original Word for Windows help file to
the hard disk and use it instead of the online Word User's Guide:

<OL><P><LI>Quit Word.

<P><LI>Copy WORDHELP.BAK from the WORD directory on the Word and Bookshelf
   CD-ROM to the Word for Windows program directory on the hard drive
   and name the file WINWORD.HLP. To do this, from an MS-DOS command
   prompt, type the following
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy &lt;drive1&gt;:\word\wordhelp.bak &lt;drive2&gt;:\winword\winword.hlp
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;drive1&gt; is the drive letter for the CD-ROM drive and &lt;drive2&gt;
   is the drive letter where Word for Windows is located. For example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy e:\word\wordhelp.bak c:\winword\winword.hlp
</PRE>
<P><LI>Remove the TOOLS-PATH line from the [Microsoft Word 2.0] section of
   your WIN.INI file. Word no longer checks the CD-ROM drive to verify
   the TOOLS-PATH, so the error message no longer occurs.

<P><LI>Restart Word. When you choose Word User's Guide from the Help menu,
   Word uses the standard Word for Windows help file from the hard disk
   instead of the online Word User's Guide from the CD-ROM.
<P>
</OL><h3>Workaround 4</h3>
 
<P>
Change the HelpIndex macro so it establishes the TOOLS-PATH setting
when you choose Word User's Guide from the Help menu. When you exit
the Word User's Guide, the HelpIndex macro removes the TOOLS-PATH
setting. If TOOLS-PATH setting currently exists in the [Microsoft Word
2.0] section of the WIN.INI file that points to the CD-ROM drive,
change this setting to the appropriate directory on the hard drive or
remove it completely.
<P>
Replace the existing text in the HelpIndex global macro with the
following:
<P>
<PRE>Sub MAIN
</PRE></OL>OldToolsPath$ = GetProfileString$("Microsoft Word 2.0", "TOOLS-PATH")
ToolsOptionsWinini .Application = "Microsoft Word 2.0", \
.Option = "TOOLS-PATH", .Setting = "E:\WORD", .Set
A$ = Files$("E:\*")
Super HelpIndex
<P>
If OldToolsPath$ = "" Then
<PRE>   ToolsOptionsWinini .Application = "Microsoft Word 2.0", \
   .Option = "TOOLS-PATH", .Delete
</PRE>Else
<PRE>   ToolsOptionsWinini .Application = "Microsoft Word 2.0", \
   .Option = "TOOLS-PATH", .Setting = OldToolsPath$, .Set
</PRE>EndIf
<PRE>End Sub

</PRE>Note: This macro refers to the CD-ROM drive as drive E:. If your CD-
ROM drive is a different drive, be sure to change "E:" in the macro to
the correct drive letter.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Multimedia Word and Bookshelf supplies the "Microsoft Word User's
Guide" as a 5 MB online help file, called the Online User's Guide. To
conserve disk space, Word runs this file from the CD-ROM by default.
<P>
When you launch Word, the TOOLS-PATH setting in the [Microsoft Word
2.0] section of the WIN.INI file instructs Word to access the CD-ROM
instead of the Word program directory for the online help file. Word
checks the validity of the TOOLS-PATH directory before it allows you
to use Word. All of the installation options in the MultiMedia Word
Setup program add the following TOOLS-PATH setting to your WIN.INI
<P>
<PRE>   TOOLS-PATH=E:\WORD

</PRE>where E: is the drive letter of the CD-ROM drive.
<P>
The Microsoft CD-ROM Extensions (MSCDEX) is the interface between MS-DOS
and the CD-ROM driver. MSCDEX caches information from the CD-ROM in
memory and then uses this cache to respond to requests from
applications, such as the request from Word to verify the TOOLS-PATH
directory.
<P>
If the CD-ROM has not been accessed since you turned on the computer
or since you changed disks in the CD-ROM drive, the MSCDEX cache
contains no information about the current CD-ROM.
<P>
When Word verifies the TOOLS-PATH directory, it does not force MSCDEX
to read the CD-ROM; instead MSCDEX checks its cache for the existence
of the TOOLS-PATH directory. As a result, the TOOLS-PATH directory is
considered to be invalid unless MSCDEX reads the CD-ROM and updates
its cache before Word attempts to verify the TOOLS-PATH directory.
