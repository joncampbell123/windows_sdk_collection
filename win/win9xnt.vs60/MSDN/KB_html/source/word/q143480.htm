   TITLE     : How to Obtain Microsoft Support Files from Online Services

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This new Word 6.0/95 converter saves Microsoft Word 97 documents in a
true binary file format with a .doc extension. The original Word 6.0/95
converter that shipped with Microsoft Office 97 saved Word 97 documents
as Rich Text Format (RTF).
<P>
If you are currently using Office 97 or Word 97, you can download the
Word 6.0/95 binary converter now. The Setup program automatically
replaces the Word 6.0/95 converter that shipped with Word 97 with the new
Word 6.0/95 binary converter. The file name remains the same.
<P>
Installing this Word 6.0/95 binary converter is the recommended solution if
you are experiencing any of the following:

<UL><LI>Increased file sizes: Files containing graphics are smaller in Word 97
   format due to new compression technology, which is not supported in
   previous versions.
<P>
   Word 97 documents saved to Word 6.0/95 format using the original
   converter often increase in size, especially if they contain graphics.
   With the new Word 6.0/95 binary converter, files will not increase as
   much in size as with the original converter. File size will be the same
   as if the documents were created from scratch in Word 6.x or Word 95.

<LI>Issues with the .rtf extension: Because the extension remains as
   .doc when the Word 97 document is opened in Word 6.x or Word 95, there
   is no chance for confusing the different file extensions (.rtf and
   .doc).

<LI>Compatibility with other products: The Word 6.0/95 binary converter
   creates files that can be read by Microsoft FrontPage, Corel
   WordPerfect, Adobe PageMaker, and other programs.
<P>
</UL><h3>To Install the Converter</h3>
