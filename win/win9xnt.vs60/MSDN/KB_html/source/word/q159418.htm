The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, you should first make a backup copy of the
registry files (System.dat and User.dat). Both are hidden files in the
Windows folder.
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you print a document containing extended characters, such as Greek
symbols, to certain printers using printer drivers that do not accept
Unicode characters, the extended characters may be printed as square boxes
even though they are displayed correctly on the screen.
<P>
The problem affects the following printers and printer drivers:

<UL><LI>Canon BubbleJet BJ-C600, 4000, 4200, 4500, 4550, v 3.40
<LI>Canon Multipass 2500 3.40
<LI>Epson Color 500
<LI>Epson Stylus Color, v 2.x
<LI>Epson Stylus Pro / XL v. 2.11BE
<LI>HP Color LaserJet 5 PCL, printer driver version F 1.300
<LI>HP DeskJet 1600C, printer driver version 4.20
<LI>HP LaserJet 4 PCL, printer driver version 3.78
<LI>HP LaserJet 6P, standard printer driver
<LI>Okidata 4 laser printer
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs because these printer drivers do not provide support
for Unicode characters.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, use any of the following methods.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1: Set a Print Flag</h3>
 
<P>
There is a flag (registry setting) for the printer driver that causes it to
use American National Standards Institute (ANSI) character layout functions
instead of Unicode character layout functions. When set correctly, this
flag allows the printer driver to print the extended characters correctly.
To set this flag, use the method appropriate for your version of Word.
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall Windows 95. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved.
Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the Changing Keys And
Values online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Note that you
should make a backup copy of the registry files (System.dat and User.dat)
before you edit the registry.
<P>
Microsoft Word 97 Service Release 1 (SR-1):
<P>
If you have installed Microsoft Word 97 Service Release 1 (SR-1), you can
set one registry entry that applies to all installed printers. If you have
the original (non-SR1) version of Word 97, see the "Word 97 (Non-SR1)
Version" section later in this article instead.
<P>
To set the registry entry, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Start menu, click Run.

<P><LI>In the Open box, type "regedit" (without the quotation marks) and then
   click OK.

<P><LI>Locate the following registry key:
<P>
<P><PRE>      HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\8.0\Word\Options
</PRE>
<P><LI>Double-click the Options key to open it.

<P><LI>With the Options key selected, on the Edit menu, point to New and click
   String Value.

<P><LI>In the right pane, type "NoWideTextPrinting" (without the quotation
   marks), and press ENTER.

<P><LI>With NoWideTextPrinting selected, on the Edit menu, click Modify.

<P><LI>In the Value Data box, type the value "1" (without the quotation marks)
   and click OK.

<P><LI>On the Registry menu, click Exit, and then restart Word.
<P>
</OL>For additional information about SR-1, please see the following article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Word 97 for
Windows. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
ASCII characters are represented by the values 0 to 127; ANSI includes
ASCII but adds characters 128 through 255. In all languages, the ASCII
characters are exactly the same, but characters 128-255 are used for
characters specific to a language, based on the code page associated with
the language. This approach handles the character differences for most
languages in the world.
<P>
Some languages (specifically, East Asian languages such as Japanese Kanji,
several dialects of Chinese, and Korean) cannot be represented with only
256 characters. The written characters in these languages are entire words
rather than individual letters, so there are typically over 6000 different
characters.
<P>
Unicode was introduced to handle these languages. Unicode uses two bytes
per character, instead of the standard one byte per character.
