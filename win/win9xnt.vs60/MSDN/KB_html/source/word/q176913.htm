The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Word 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If the "When selecting, automatically select entire word" option is turned
on and you select the first word in a sentence, Word may select the period
(or other end-of-sentence punctuation such as a question mark) at the end
of the previous sentence.
<P>
Similarly, when you select the second of two words, sometimes Word selects
the first word as well.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
You selected two or more spaces to the left of your selected word.
<P>
Word defines any spaces before the first space to the left of a word
as part of the preceding word. Word defines the end-of-sentence punctuation
as a separate word. When there are two or more spaces between two words and
you select more than the space to the left of the word, Word automatically
selects the first word (or the end-of-sentence punctuation), too.
<P>
For example, in the sentence below, Word selects ". This " if you select
both spaces preceding "This", whereas Word only selects " This " if you
select only one space preceding "This".
<P>
<PRE>   This is a sentence. This is another sentence.

</PRE>NOTE: There are two spaces between the two sentences. Word defines the
period as a separate word, so when you select its trailing space, Word
selects the period as well.
<P>
As another example, if you select more than the first space to the left of
"Apple" in the sentence below, Word selects "Fruit" as well.
<P>
<PRE>   Fruit    Apple

</PRE>NOTE: There are four spaces between "Fruit" and "Apple".
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, use one of the following methods.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1</h3>
 
<P>
To select text using the mouse when the "When selecting, automatically
select entire word" option is turned on, do not select the space before the
first word in a sentence.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 2</h3>
 
<P>
Select the text using the keyboard instead of the mouse.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 3</h3>
 
<P>
Turn off the "When selecting, automatically select entire word" option,
follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Options (Windows) or Preferences (Macintosh).

<P><LI>Click the Edit tab and then click to clear the "When selecting,
   automatically select entire word" check box.

<P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The "When selecting, automatically select entire word" option selects the
space following any word you select. When there are two or more spaces
between sentences and you select two or more of those spaces, Word defines
those spaces as part of the preceding word, so it selects that word as
well.
<P>

Word, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
