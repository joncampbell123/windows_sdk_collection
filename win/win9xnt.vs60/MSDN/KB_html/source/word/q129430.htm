<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you look at text in outline view, it looks different than it does in
normal or page layout views. In outline view, text is indented according to
heading level. The same text viewed in page layout view lines up along the
left margin. Other paragraph formatting, such as Space Before, does not
appear at all in outline view.
<P>
For example, three paragraphs with Heading 1, Heading 2, and Heading 3
styles applied appear this way in outline view:
<P>
<PRE>     Heading 1 style is applied to this paragraph.

          Heading 2 style is applied to this paragraph.

               Heading 3 style is applied to this paragraph.

</PRE>In normal or page layout view, the same paragraphs are aligned with the
left margin:
<P>
<PRE>     Heading 1 style is applied to this paragraph.

     Heading 2 style is applied to this paragraph.

     Heading 3 style is applied to this paragraph.

</PRE>When you print from the different views, Word may use different margins.
This is described in the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../urjump.htm">Q121609</A></B>
   TITLE     : Margins Print Incorrectly from Outline View

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Outline view is primarily an editing view; text is arranged so that you can
easily see your document's structure and so that as much of the document as
possible will fit on the screen.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Redefine the built-in heading styles so that their indentations in normal
and page layout views match those in outline view. For example, redefine
Heading 2 style to be indented .5 inch from the left, redefine Heading 3 so
that it is indented 1 inch, and so on.
<P>
Use the following steps to redefine the styles:

<OL><P><LI>On the Format menu, click Style.

<P><LI>In the Styles list, select the heading style you want to change.

<P><LI>Click Modify.

<P><LI>If you want the changes you are making to be available to all new
   documents, click to select the Add To Template check box, which is 
   located at the lower-left corner of this dialog box.

<P><LI>Click Format, and then click Paragraph.

<P><LI>Select the Indents And Spacing tab.

<P><LI>In the Left box, type the amount you want the style indented by.

<P><LI>Click OK twice.
<P>
   If there are other styles you want to modify, repeat steps 2 through
   8.

<P><LI>In the Style dialog box, choose Close.
<P>
</OL>When you view the document in normal view or page layout view, Word 
displays the correct indentations.
