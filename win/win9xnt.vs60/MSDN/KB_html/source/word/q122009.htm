</PRE><h3>Overview</h3>
 
<P>
Word 6.0 is the most powerful word processing software ever developed
for the Macintosh platform. To get the best possible performance from
Word, you may need to optimize your Macintosh system. This Application
Note contains instructions you can use to optimize your Macintosh. To
optimize your Macintosh, you may need to make adjustments to your
system software (extensions, and fonts) or hardware configuration
(processor type, speed, amount of memory, and available hard disk
space).
<P>
For additional information about optimizing the performance of Word
for the Macintosh, including specific instructions for a Macintosh
with 4 to 6 MB of RAM or a Macintosh with at least 6 MB of RAM, order
the "MW1052: Setup and Performance Optimization" Application Note.
<P>
<P><h3>Memory Allocation</h3>
 
<P>
When you install Word, the amount of memory Setup allocates to Word is
based on the amount of memory installed in your Macintosh. On some
systems, Word may run faster if you increase the amount of memory
allocated to the application (with additional memory, Word performs
less-frequent disk swapping). If you usually use Word to work on long
documents, you can probably enhance Word's performance by increasing
its Macintosh system memory allocation. To give more memory to Word,
do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Quit Word if it is running. (From the File menu, choose Quit.)

<P><LI>In the Finder, select the Microsoft Word application icon.

<P><LI>From the File menu in the Finder, choose Get Info.

<P><LI>Increase the value in the Preferred Size box (in System 7.1) or the
   Current Size box (in System 7.0). As a reference, if you have 8 MB
   of memory on your Macintosh, change the Preferred Size setting to
   at least 3000K (with 8 MB of RAM, you can go as high as 6000K).

<P><LI>Close the Microsoft Word Info window, and then restart your
   Macintosh.

<P><LI>If you have a Power Macintosh(TM), turn on the Virtual Memory
   option in the Memory Control Panel window. In the Size box, set the
   minimum Virtual Memory size. (NOTE: If you are using RAM Doubler
   1.5.1, Virtual Memory is unnecessary.)
<P>
</OL>System Resources
 
<P>
Fonts--especially Type 1 PostScript(R) fonts--consume system resources
on your Macintosh. Survey the fonts installed on your computer and
remove any you don't need. (To remove a font, drag it out of the
System file in your System Folder to the Desktop or another folder.)
<P>
<P><h3>System Conflicts</h3>
 
<P>
Extensions and Control Panel devices are memory-resident programs that
add functionality to the Macintosh system. These programs, which are
generically referred to as INITs or extensions, are located in the
Extensions and Control Panels folders in the System folder. Sometimes
these files conflict with one another or with a program such as Word,
thereby affecting performance. Use the following procedure, in which
you restart your computer with all extensions turned off (also called
a "clean boot"), to determine whether an extension conflict is
affecting your system's performance:

<OL><P><LI>Switch to the Finder.

<P><LI>Hold down the SHIFT key and choose Restart from the Special menu.

<P><LI>Continue holding down the SHIFT key until the "Welcome to
   Macintosh. Extensions Off" message appears.

<P><LI>Start Word and do some work. If Word performs better, you can
   conclude that one or more extensions is affecting the performance
   of your Macintosh. Use the procedure below to isolate the extension
   that is causing a problem.
<P>
<P><PRE>    NOTE: To reactivate extensions, restart your Macintosh by choosing
    Restart from the Special menu. Do not hold down the SHIFT key.
</PRE><P>
</OL><h3>To Isolate the Problem Extension</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Move the Control Panel folder from the System folder to the
   Macintosh Desktop.

<P><LI>Restart your computer (from the Special menu, choose Restart).
   If the problem no longer occurs, one of the Control Panel devices
   is the culprit. On the other hand, if the problem still occurs, one
   of the files in your Extensions folder is probably causing the
   conflict. Now that you've identified the "problem folder," you're
   ready to isolate the conflicting extension in that folder.

<P><LI>Move the Control Panel folder back to the System folder.

<P><LI>Open the problem folder (either the Control Panel or Extensions
   folder), and move half the items from that folder to an empty
   folder on the Desktop.

<P><LI>Restart your computer. If the problem still occurs, then the file
   causing the conflict is one of the items that remains in the
   problem folder in the System folder. In this case, continue with
   step 6.
<P>
   On the other hand, if the problem no longer occurs, then the file
   that is causing the conflict is one of the items you moved to the
   empty folder on the Desktop. In this case, skip to step 7.

<P><LI>If the INIT or extension causing the conflict remains in the
   problem folder:
<P>
   a. Move one of the files from the problem folder to the folder on
<P><PRE>      the Desktop.
</PRE><P>
   b. Restart your computer.
<P>
   c. As long as the problem continues to occur, repeat steps 6a and
<P><PRE>      6b. Once the problem stops occurring, you can conclude that the
      last item you removed from the problem folder is the one that
      conflicts with your system. Skip to step 8.
</PRE>
<P><LI>If the INIT or extension causing the conflict is in the folder on
   the Desktop:
<P>
   a. Move one of the files from the Desktop folder back to its
<P><PRE>      original folder in the System folder.
</PRE><P>
   b. Restart your computer.
<P>
   c. Repeat steps 7a and 7b until the problem recurs. When this
<P><PRE>      happens, you can conclude that the last item you moved is the
      one that conflicts with your system.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Once you identify the extension or Control Panel device that
   conflicts with your system, call the manufacturer of the extension
   to see if they know about the problem or have a solution for it
   (such as reinstalling the extension or changing its settings). The
   manufacturer may have an updated version of the extension that
   solves the problem. If you still need help after you contact the
   extension manufacturer, you can phone Microsoft Technical Support at 
</OL>(425) 635-7200 for information about known
<PRE>   extensions that conflict with Word. For more assistance
   troubleshooting extension conflicts on the Macintosh, call Apple
   Technical Support at (800) SOS-APPL (767-2775).

    NOTE: The majority of Control Panel devices and extensions do not
    cause system conflicts. In general, printer drivers, network
    drivers, and fonts in the Extensions folder do not conflict with
    most Macintosh systems. Similarly, the "standard" Control Panel
    devices that Apple ships in the Control Panels folder rarely cause
    any problems. Below is a list of the standard Control Panel files
    that Apple supplies with most Macintosh computers:

       Cache Switch (68040         Memory
         processors only)          Monitors
       Color                       Mouse
       Date &amp; Time                 Network
       Easy Access                 Numbers
       File Sharing Monitor        Sharing Setup
       General Controls            Sound
       Keyboard                    Startup Disk
       Labels                      Users &amp; Groups
       Map                         Views

</PRE></OL><h3>System Maintenance</h3>
 
<P>
You should rebuild your Desktop file on a regular basis, as frequently
as once per month, to maintain overall system performance. Your
Desktop is a hidden database file that contains information about the
files, folders, and other resources on your hard disk. To rebuild your
Desktop, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Hold down the COMMAND and OPTION keys and start your computer.

<P><LI>Hold down COMMAND+OPTION until the "Would you like to rebuild the
   Desktop" message appears.

<P><LI>Release COMMAND+OPTION and then choose OK.
<P>
</OL><h3>Other Suggestions</h3>
 

<UL><LI>If you don't need the millions of colors your Macintosh supports,
   reduce the number of colors from millions to thousands, 256, or
   even 16 colors. With fewer colors active, your Macintosh does not
   take as long to redraw the screen, and overall performance may
   improve. To change the Colors setting, choose Control Panels from
   the Apple menu, and double-click the Monitors icon.

<LI>If you have at least 16 MB of memory, create a RAM disk in which to
   run Word. To create a RAM disk, choose Control Panels from the
   Apple menu, and double-click the Memory icon. For more information,
   see your Macintosh system documentation.

<LI>In Word, work in normal view instead of page layout view whenever
   possible. In page layout view, Word takes longer to redraw the
   screen.

<LI>Select the Background Printing option that best fits the way you
   work. With Background Printing turned on, your document prints a
   bit more slowly, but you can continue working in Word while your
   document prints. With Background Printing turned off, your document
   prints quickly, but you cannot work in Word until the print job is
   finished. To change the Background Printing option, do the
   following:
<P>
   1. From the Apple menu, choose Chooser.
<P>
   2. In the Chooser window, select your printer icon.
<P>
   3. If Background Printing is available for your printer, select the
<P><PRE>      On or Off option as appropriate, then close the Chooser window.
