The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how to use Sharkware version 1.0 with Microsoft
Word. Sharkware is a personal information manager that keeps track of
business contacts, address book information, and appointments.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Defining Your Word Processor</h3>
 
<P>
After you install Sharkware, you must identify the Word processor you plan
to use with Sharkware. To do this:

<OL><P><LI>From the File menu, choose Preferences.

<P><LI>In the Preferences dialog box, choose Printing.

<P><LI>In the Printing Preferences dialog box, complete the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>    a. Select the type of document for which you are setting up
       preferences (letter, fax, memo, report, label, or envelope).
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    b. Select the "Use Word Processor with DDE" option.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       NOTE: Failure to do this creates the appearance that none of your
       templates are designed correctly. In fact, all the documents you
       create will be based on the Word NORMAL.DOT template if you select
       the option "Use Word Processor Without DDE."
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    c. Make sure the correct template is selected for the type of document
       you are creating.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Choose the Word Processors button.

<P><LI>Select Microsoft Word from the Word Processor Name drop-down list and
   choose the OK button.

<P><LI>Choose the OK button.
<P>
</OL><h3>Using Sharkware Templates</h3>
 
<P>
To use one of the Sharkware templates, choose Select Template from the
Write menu, select the desired template, and choose the OK button.
Sharkware opens a new document in Word based on one of the following
templates:
<P>
<PRE>   SWENV.DOT          Envelopes
   SWFAX.DOT          Fax Cover Page
   SWLAB.DOT          Labels
   SWLETTER.DOT       Business Letters
   SWMEMO.DOT         Business Memos

</PRE></OL>If you choose to, you can modify any of these templates by opening them in
Word, making your changes and saving the templates to the SHARK directory.
To preserve your original template, it is recommended that you save your
modified template using a new filename.
<P>
<P><h3>Merging from Sharkware to Word</h3>
 
<P>
Choosing Letter, Fax, Memo, Label, or Envelope from the Write menu in
Sharkware allows you to merge a single (current) record. If you want to
perform a merge that includes all contacts in your database, or contacts
based on selected criteria, use the Print Merge command on the Write menu.
<P>
As your information is being merged, two temporary files are created, one
for the main document, one for the data document. When your merge is
completed, these temporary files are closed and the final, merged document
appears on the screen. You can then choose Print from the File menu in
Word
to print your merge document.
<P>
<P><h3>Sharkware Mergefield Names</h3>
 
<P>
Sharkware uses the following naming conventions and conversions for
popular
mergefields. All Sharkware templates contain macros that convert the
Sharkware database names to the Word mergefield names.
<P>
<PRE>   Sharkware name          Word mergefield name
   --------------          --------------------

   Name, Last              LastName
   Company                 Company
   Name, First             FirstName
   Name, Middle            MiddleName
   Title                   Title
   Salutation              Salutation
   Phone 1                 Phone1
   Phone 1 Ext             Phone1Ext
   Address Line 1          A1_type
   Address Line 2          A2_type
   City                    C1_type
   State                   ST_type
   Zip Code                ZC_type

</PRE><h3>Sharkware Macros and Error Messages</h3>
 
<P>
Each Sharkware template for Word contains an Autonew macro that restores
Word if it is minimized. If Word is closed when you initiate a print merge
from within Sharkware, you receive the following error message
<P>
<PRE>   The Window is too small.

</PRE>followed by a subsequent error message indicating that Sharkware
<P>
<PRE>   Cannot initiate DDE conversation with [Microsoft Word]

</PRE>You are then instructed to close Sharkware, start Microsoft Word, and
minimize it before you can perform the merge.
<P>
The Create Merge macro included in the SWLETTER, SWFAX, and SWMEMO
templates is used to execute the conversion of the Sharkware fields to
mergefields and initiates the merge to a new document.
<P>
The SWLAB and SWENV templates use a macro called ReportEngine to initiate
the merge command before calling either the Label or Envelopes macro to
convert the Sharkware fields to Word mergefields. The templates then
perform a merge to a new document. The SWLAB template includes two
additional macros to align either single- or multiple-label formats,
similar to the macro used in the Word 2.0 MAILLABL template.
<P>
<P><h3>Importing/Exporting Data</h3>
 
<P>
Sharkware allows you to import and export files as comma-delimited
ASCII text or in dBase formats.
