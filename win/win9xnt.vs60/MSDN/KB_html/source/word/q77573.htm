The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for the Macintosh, versions 5.0, 5.1, 6.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The Suitcase Setting that allows Font menu items to appear in their own 
typeface does not work in Microsoft Word. This problem may occur in either 
of the following cases.
<P>
<P><h3>Case 1: Word 6.0</h3>
 
<P>
You use Word version 6.0 for the Macintosh with Suitcase 2.1.4 or 2.1.5.
<P>
<P><h3>Case 2: Word 5.x</h3>
 
<P>
You use Word version 5.x for the Macintosh with Suitcase II version 1.2 
through 1.2.11.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Case 1: Word 6.0</h3>
 
<P>
To allow the fonts to be displayed in their own typeface in Word 6.0 using 
Suitcase 2.1.4 or 2.1.5, you must add the Font menu using a macro contained 
in the "5.1 Upgrade Document Template." To use the AddFontMenu macro, 
follow these steps: 

<OL><P><LI>On the File menu, click Templates, and then click Organizer.

<P><LI>Select the Macros tab.

<P><LI>Click the Close File button under one of the list boxes, then
   click the same button, now labeled Open File.

<P><LI>From the Word 6.0 program folder, open the Macros folder. In
   the List Files of Type box, click Document Templates. From the
   list box above, select "5.1 Upgrade" and click Open.

<P><LI>This displays two macros in the list box in the Organizer,
   AddFontMenu and AddressBook. Select AddFontMenu and click  Copy 
   to copy that macro to Normal. Click Close (in the lower-right corner) 
   to close the Organizer.

<P><LI>In Word, on the Tools menu, click Macro. (A document must be
   open to see the Tools menu.)

<P><LI>Display Macros Available In All Active Templates. Select
   AddFontMenu in the list box and click Run. In a few seconds you 
   receive a prompt that this will add an item to your menu. Click Yes.

<P><LI>When the macro finishes, the Font menu appears between
   Format and Tools on the menu bar in Word. To display a list of
   installed fonts in their respective typefaces, hold down SHIFT 
   and click the newly added Font menu.
<P>
</OL><h3>Case 2: Word 5.x</h3>
 
<P>
This problem does not occur in earlier versions of Word because of a 
workaround built into the Word program. Because this workaround did not 
integrate the custom Font menu with other programs, it was not included in 
Word version 5.0.
