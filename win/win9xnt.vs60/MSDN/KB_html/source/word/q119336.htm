<PRE>   1.  Q. How do I convert my Word 4.x and 5.x for the Macintosh or Word
          for Windows(TM) files to Word 6.0 for the Macintosh format?

       A. Word comes with converters for Word 4.x and 5.x for the
          Macintosh and Word 2.x for Windows. To convert these (and most
          other) types of documents, you simply open them in Word 6.0 for
          the Macintosh. Word handles the conversion automatically,
          preserving the original content and formatting. Most of the
          time, Word recognizes the file format, converts the document,
          and displays it in a Word window. If the converter you need was
          not installed when you installed Word, Word displays the
          Convert File dialog box and asks you to choose a converter. To
          install additional converters, you need to run Word Setup
          again. For information about installing components, double-
          click the Help button on the Standard toolbar, type "setup"
          (without quotation marks), and press ENTER twice.

          If you have installed all the converters that come with Word
          and you still don't see the one you need, you may be able to
          obtain it on a supplemental disk. For instructions about how to
          obtain supplemental converters and graphics filters that were
          not shipped with Word, double-click the Help button on the
          Standard toolbar, and then type "readme" (without quotation
          marks). Press ENTER twice, and then click File Conversion.

          NOTE: Word Setup does not install any file converters if you
          performed a Typical or Minimum installation. If the converter
          you need is not installed, run Word Setup again.

          For more information about converting files in Word 6.0 for the
          Macintosh, refer to one of the following resources:

           - For online instructions, double-click the Help button on the
             Standard toolbar, then type "converting file" (without
             quotation marks). You can also double-click the Help button
             on the Standard toolbar, type "readme", press ENTER twice,
             and click File Conversion.

           - "Microsoft Word Quick Results," version 6.0, Chapter 6,
             "Switching from a Previous Version of Word."

           - "Microsoft Word User's Guide," version 6.0, Chapter 26,
             "Converting File Formats."

           - To convert several documents at once, use the batch
             conversion macro in the Convert template (BatchConversion).

   2.  Q. How do I convert my Word 6.0 for the Macintosh files to other
          file formats, including Word 4.x or 5.x for the Macintosh or Word
          for Windows?

       A. By using the converters supplied with Word for the Macintosh,
          you can save Word documents in other file formats and preserve
          as much formatting as the other application can support. To
          save a file in another file format, including Word 4.x or 5.x
          for the Macintosh or Word 2.x for Windows format, you simply
          use the Save As command: Choose Save As On the File menu,
          select a file format in the Save File As Type box, type a name
          for the file, and then choose the Save button.

          If the file format you need does not appear in the Save File As
          Type box, the converter is not installed. To install additional
          converters, run Word Setup again. For information about
          installing components, double-click the Help button on the
          Standard toolbar, type "setup" (without quotation marks), and
          press ENTER twice.

          If you have installed all the converters that come with Word
          and you still don't see the one you need, you may be able to
          obtain it on a supplemental disk. For instructions about how to
          obtain supplemental converters and graphics filters that were
          not shipped with Word, double-click the Help button on the
          Standard toolbar, and then type "readme" (without quotation
          marks). Press ENTER twice, and then click File Conversion.

          NOTE: Word Setup does not install any file converters if you
          performed a Typical or Minimum installation. If the converter
          you need is not installed, run Word Setup again.

          Word recognizes the file formats of many common word-
          processing, spreadsheet, database, and page-layout programs. If
          you need to transfer documents between Word and applications
          for which specific converters aren't available, you can also
          import and export documents in plain-text formats. Plain-text
          formats retain the text of a document without most of the
          formatting. These formats are also useful for transferring
          documents when using electronic mail systems.

          Refer to one of the following resources for more information
          about converting files in Word 6.0 for the Macintosh:

           - For online instructions, double-click the Help button on the
             Standard toolbar, then type "converting file" (without
             quotation marks). You can also double-click the Help button
             on the Standard toolbar, type "readme", press ENTER twice,
             and click File Conversion.

           - "Microsoft Word Quick Results," version 6.0, Chapter 6,
             "Switching from a Previous Version of Word."

           - "Microsoft Word User's Guide," version 6.0, Chapter 26,
             "Converting File Formats."

           - To convert several documents at once, use the batch
             conversion macro in the Convert template (BatchConversion).

   3.  Q. How do I convert my dictionaries from an earlier version of Word
          for the Macintosh or from Word for Windows?

       A. In Word 6.0 for the Macintosh, you can use your dictionaries
          from Word 4.x or 5.x for the Macintosh and from Word 6.0 for
          Windows. For instructions about opening and using a custom
          dictionary, order this set of questions and answers; see
          Chapter 5, "Editing and Proofing Tools," in the "Microsoft Word
          User's Guide," or double-click the Help button on the Standard
          toolbar and then type "custom dictionaries" (without quotation
          marks).

          To install a custom dictionary from Word 4.x or 5.x for the
          Macintosh:

          1. Open a new document based on the Normal template by choosing
             the New button on the Standard toolbar.

          2. From the Tools menu, choose Options.

          3. Select the Spelling tab.

          4. Under Custom Dictionaries, choose the Add button.

          5. From the List Files Of Type box, select All Files.

          6. Select the custom dictionary you want to use in Word 6.0 and
             then choose the Open button.

             Word adds the dictionary to the Custom Dictionary in the
             Tools Options dialog box and selects the check box next to
             it. When this happens, the custom dictionary is ready to use
             in Word.

          7. Choose OK.

          To install a custom dictionary from Word 6.0 for Windows:

          1. Transfer the custom dictionary to the Macintosh environment
             using a file transfer utility such as Apple(R) File
             Exchange.

          2. Start Word 6.0 for the Macintosh.

          3. Follow steps 1 through 7 in the previous procedure, "To
             install a custom dictionary from Word 4.x or 5.x for the
             Macintosh."

   4.  Q. How do I convert my glossaries from an earlier version of Word
          for the Macintosh?

       A. In Word 6.0, glossaries are now called AutoText entries. To
          convert your glossaries from earlier versions of Word for the
          Macintosh to AutoText entries, simply open the glossary file in
          Word 6.0. Choose OK when Word displays the following message:

             The user-defined glossary entries in this file will be
             converted to AutoText entries, and stored in the current
             template, &lt;Template Name&gt;. Built-in glossary entries are
             available via the Insert Date and Time or Insert Field
             commands.

          For additional information, double-click the Help button on the
          Standard toolbar. Then type "glossary" (without quotation marks).

          NOTE: In Word 5.x for the Macintosh, glossaries are usually
          located in the program folder, which may be titled "Microsoft
          Word," "Word 5.1," or a similar name.

   5.  Q. How do I convert my settings files and default styles from
          earlier versions of Word for the Macintosh so I can use them in
          Word 6.0?

       A. To use your Word 5.0 or 5.1 settings files, including default
          styles, in Word 6.0 for the Macintosh, save the settings in a
          document template. To do this, open the settings file in Word
          6.0, then save the file in Document Template file format. When
          you open your settings file, Word displays the following
          message:

             Would you prefer to merge the settings and styles in this
             file into the current template, &lt;Template Name&gt;, or to save
             them to a new template?

          Choose the Merge To Current button to save your settings in the
          current template, or choose the Save button to save your
          settings in a new Word template. In either case, be sure to
          save the template in your Template folder.

          NOTE: In Word 6.0 for the Macintosh, you can convert settings
          files from Word 5.0 or 5.1 only. You cannot convert Word 4.x
          settings files.

          When you base a new document on the template, you can use many
          of the customized menu and keyboard shortcuts you stored in the
          settings file. Some menu and keyboard settings, however, cannot
          be used in Word 6.0. Preferences and other options you saved in
          the settings file, such as spelling and grammar options, are
          not saved in the template.

          For additional information, double-click the Help button on the
          Standard toolbar, then type "settings" (without quotation marks).

   6.  Q. How do I convert stationery documents to templates?

       A. If you used stationery in earlier versions of Word, consider
          converting the stationery to a Word template. To convert the
          stationery to a Word template, choose Save As from the File
          menu, and then select Document Template in the Save File As
          Type box.

          For additional information, double-click the Help button on the
          Standard toolbar. Then type "stationary" (without quotation
          marks).

   7.  Q. How do I convert my Word 5.x envelope address lists so I can use
          them in Word 6.0?

       A. To use addresses generated with the Create Envelope command in
          Word version 5.1, convert them to AutoText entries in Word 6.0
          using the Word 5.1 Upgrade template, which is located in the
          Macros folder in the Word program folder. To use the macros in
          the Word 5.1 Upgrade template, choose Open On the File menu
          and open the 5.1 Upgrade template. Then follow the directions
          in the template. Before you convert the addresses, make sure
          your Word 5.1 Word Toolbar Prefs file is in the Preferences
          folder in the System Folder.

          For additional information about converting Word 5.1 address
          lists, double-click the Help button on the Standard toolbar.
          Then type "address lists" (without quotation marks).

          For information about using these addresses when you print
          envelopes, see "Using Addresses from Word 5.1 for the
          Macintosh," in Chapter 23, "Printing," of the "Microsoft Word
          User's Guide."
