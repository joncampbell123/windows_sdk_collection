<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes the use of the "Lock Results" switch.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The "Lock Results" switch prevents fields that are part of a result from
being updated. The lock result switch is represented by the exclamation
point, and can be used in a field as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   {field \!}

</PRE>where "field" is the field type. This switch locks the results of a
field in an included file from being updated to the results of the
main file. This is useful in situations where a file included in a
main document contains fields that would have different results in the
main document. These document-specific fields include TITLE, FILENAME,
KEYWORDS, COMMENTS, and SEQ fields.
<P>
When you include a document containing these fields in a main document,
these fields display the information associated with the main document
rather than the included file where you insert them. If the INCLUDE
FILENAME field in the main document contains the lock result switch
(that is, {include filename \!}), then the results of these fields
reflect the information associated with the included file. These
secondary "included" fields are locked, or associated only with the
included document when the lock result switch is added to the include
field in the main document.
<P>
Note: This switch does not prevent all fields from updating. The
INCLUDE field still updates in the main document, as do the TIME,
DATE, and equations fields. The switch only locks field results that
are specific to a particular document.
