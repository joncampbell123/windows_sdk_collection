The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Macintosh, versions 6.0, 6.0.1
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows NT, version 6.0

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Word 6.x, portions of a graphic that are adjacent to or touch the
picture's bounding box may be truncated by one pixel after you double-click
the picture and close it.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may occur when you edit graphics that have been inserted or
pasted in a Word document. Drawing objects are not affected. However, the
problem may occur when you edit a drawing object that was copied and pasted
as a picture using the Paste Special command.
<P>
When you edit a picture, Word calculates the original amount of white space
in the graphic. Occasionally, Word rounds up the amount of white space by
one pixel, causing objects in the graphic that border the graphic bounding
box to be truncated.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To recover portions of the graphic that have been truncated, double-click
the graphic, click the Reset Picture Boundary button, and close the
graphic.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Word
version 7.0 for Windows 95 and Word 98 Macintosh Edition.
