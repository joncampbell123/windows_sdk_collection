<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Word does not include a color separation printing feature.
<P>
This article contains a method you can use to create spot color
separation in a document that contains text formatted for different
colors. This method does not, however, provide color separation for
color graphics, so color graphics are unaffected.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Color separation is the process of printing each of the colors in a
document as a separate document so that the printer can print each
separation using a different-colored ink. Many color printers use the
cyan-magenta-yellow-black (CMYK) color model, so color separation
often corresponds to this model.
<P>
Spot color separation is one type of color separation in which a
single color of ink is specified and each page having elements in that
color is printed as a separate print job. You can use spot color
separation to create either positive or negative color separation.
<P>
When you print using a PostScript printer, you can alter the
percentage of color used to print spot color separation by modifying
halftone settings in the Advanced Options dialog box of the PostScript
printer driver.
<P>
<P><h3>How to Create Color Separation for Text Only (Not for Graphics)</h3>
 
<P>
This procedure describes how to format all of the text in your
multiple-color document for white except the text for which you are
creating the color separation. Repeat these steps for each color for
which you want to produce a color separation.
<P>
NOTE: While the file can be closed without saving after printing each 
color, it may be best to save the file with a new name before starting and 
use the copy of the file during this process. This will insure that the 
original file is maintained.
<P>
To format your text for color separation, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Edit menu, click Replace.

<P><LI>Click to clear the Find What check box. With the insertion point in
    the Find What box, click Format (in Word 97 or 98 click More to 
    display the Format option), and then click Font.

<P><LI>From the Color list, select one of the text colors for which you
    are not creating the current color separation. Click OK.
<P>
    For example, if you are creating a magenta color separation, select
    yellow, black, or cyan in the Color list.

<P><LI>Click to clear the Replace With box, if necessary. With the insertion 
    point in the Replace With box, Click Format click Format (in Word 97 or 
    98 click More to display the Format option), and then click Font.

<P><LI>From the Color list, select White, and then click OK.

<P><LI>Click Replace All and then click Close.

<P><LI>Repeat steps 1 through 6 for each of the colors for which you are
    NOT creating the current color separation. For example, if you are
    creating the magenta color separation in a four-color document,
    repeat steps 1 through 6 once each for yellow, black, and cyan.

<P><LI>Repeat steps 1 and 2. From the Color list, select the text color
    for which you are creating the current color separation. Click
    OK.

<P><LI>Repeat step 4.

<P><LI>From the Color list, select Black and then click OK.

<P><LI>Repeat step 6.

<P><LI>Print the document.

<P><LI>Close the document without saving the changes

<P><LI>Reopen the document and repeat steps 1 through 13 to create a
    color separation for each text color in your document.
