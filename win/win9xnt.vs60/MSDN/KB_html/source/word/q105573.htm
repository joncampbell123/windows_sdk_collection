The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The following enhancements were made to the spelling and grammar
checking functions in Microsoft Word 6.0 for Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>Spelling Enhancements</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Ignore All</h3>
 
<P>
Word 2.0 for Windows retains the Ignore All list only during the
current proofing session. Throughout the current session of Word 6.0
for Windows, Word keeps a running log of the words you choose to be
ignored during a spell check. If you choose the Ignore All button for
a specific word in the Spelling dialog, Word remembers to ignore the
word until you exit Word for Windows. To reset the Ignore All without
exiting Word, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>From the Tools menu, choose Options.

<P><LI>Select the Spelling tab.

<P><LI>Choose the Reset Ignore All button.

<P><LI>Choose OK.
<P>
</OL><h3>Dictionary Suggestions from Custom Dictionaries</h3>
 
<P>
Word 2.0 for Windows cannot make word suggestions based on the
contents of a custom dictionary. A new switch was added to the Common
Speller API in Word version 2.0c , but an interface was not available
to change the switch from defaulting to the main dictionary.
<P>
Word 6.0 for Windows now has an interface for this feature. By
default, Word 6.0 will suggest words from the main dictionary only.
You can, however, turn off this option by clearing the "From Main
Dictionary Only" check box in the Spelling section of the Tools
Options dialog.
<P>
<P><h2>Grammar Checking Enhancements</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Editable Grammar Checker Sentence Box</h3>
 
<P>
The text in the Sentence edit box is completely editable in Word 6.0
for Windows. This improvement allows you to edit the sentence without
switching the focus from the Grammar dialog (choose Grammar from the
Tools menu to access this dialog). In previous versions of Word for
Windows, you can make corrections by switching the focus from the
Grammar dialog to the document text and then restart the grammar
checker. However, Word for Windows registers this change as being two
separate grammar checking sessions. As a result, the readability
statistics are not correct.
<P>
<P><h3>ToolsGrammarStatisisticsArray</h3>
 
<P>
The ToolsGrammarStatisisticsArray function is new in Word 6.0 for
Windows ToolsGrammarStatisisticsArray performs a grammar check, and
then fills a two-dimensional array with the available grammar
statistics for the active document. This function allows you retrieve
document statistics without having to run the full, interactive
grammar session.
<P>
The following macro example defines a two-dimensional array for
storing grammar statistics, fills the array with grammar statistics
for the active document, and then inserts a two-column list of
statistics at the end of the document (the statistic list is included
below):
