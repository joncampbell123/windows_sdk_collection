The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows versions 2.0, 2.0a, 2.0a-CD, 2.0b,
   2.0c, 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article explains how to print envelopes on the IBM 4019 LaserPrinter
from Word for Windows. This procedure requires that you use version 4.11 or
later of the IBM 4019 printer driver (IBM4019.DRV), available from Lexmark.
<P>
To obtain version 4.11 or later of IBM4019.DRV, contact Lexmark technical
support at (606) 232-3000 or download the driver from the Lexmark Bulletin
Board (BBS) at (606) 232-5238. Support of this printer driver is the sole
responsibility of Lexmark. IBM4019.DRV is manufactured by Lexmark, a vendor
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise,
regarding this product's performance or reliability.
<P>
<P><h2>QUICK LIST OF ISSUES AND WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 

<OL><P><LI>In Word 6.0, the default position indicated by the envelope feed icon is
   incorrect.
<P>
   Workaround: Turn on the clockwise rotation check box so that the
   envelope feed method suggested by Word matches the feed method indicated
   by the printer.

<P><LI>Envelopes of size 6 3/4 do not print.
<P>
   Cause: This is a physical limitation of the printer.

<P><LI>The envelope pulls from the manual feed instead of from the envelope
   feeder.
<P>
   Workaround: In Word 6.0, make sure Envelope is selected as the paper
   source in the Printing Options dialog box. (To open the Printing Options
   dialog box, choose Envelopes And Labels from the Tools menu, choose the
   Options button, and then select the Printing Options tab.)
<P>
   In Word 2.x, select the "Printer's Envelope Feeder has been Installed"
   option in the Print Options dialog box. (To open the Print Options
   dialog box, choose Options from the Tools menu, and then select the
   Print icon under Category.)
<P>
   The envelope feeder on the printer must be configured to match the size
   of the envelopes being printed. For more information on how to configure
   the envelope feeder, see later sections in this article.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In the instructions below, when you are instructed to feed an envelope,
insert the envelope in the manual feed slot face up with the top of the
envelope on the left. Slide the envelope in the slot until the envelope
cannot advance any farther. Envelopes print in landscape orientation on
this printer.
<P>
<P><h2>USING THE MANUAL FEED ENVELOPE SLOT</h2>
 
<P>
If you do not have an optional envelope feeder for your IBM 4019 printer,
you must feed envelopes through the manual feed slot on the back of the
printer.

<OL><P><LI>Install version 4.11 of the IBM 4019 printer driver. Make sure the
   printer is in "native (4019)" mode. For information on switching to
   native mode, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
   Base:

<P>
</OL><h2>POTENTIAL PROBLEMS WITH ENVELOPES</h2>
 

<UL><LI>Paper Jams
   ----------
<P>
   Size 6 3/4 envelopes (3 5/8 x 6 1/2 inches) do not print correctly.
   The envelope address and return address text print approximately 3
   inches too far to the right, which causes the envelope address to be
   cut off on the right side. After the envelope prints, the printer
   displays a paper jam error message (Status 2 on the front panel).
   This error is caused by a physical paper-handling limitation of the
   printer.

<LI>Envelope Pulls from Manual Feed Instead of Envelope Feeder
   ----------------------------------------------------------
<P>
   The "Printer's Envelope Feeder has been Installed" option must be
   selected in the Print Options dialog box, and the envelope feeder must
   be configured to match the size of the envelopes being print merged.
<P>
   If either of these conditions are not met, the envelope will pull from
   the manual feed slot.
<P>
</UL><h2>HOW TO CONFIGURE THE IBM 4019 ENVELOPE FEEDER</h2>
 

<OL><P><LI>If the Ready light is on, press and release the Start/Stop button.

<P><LI>Press and release the Paper button until Envelope is selected.

<P><LI>While holding the Code button down, press and release the Paper
   button until a number is displayed that corresponds to the envelope
   size you want (see the above section for references to envelope
   sizes).
