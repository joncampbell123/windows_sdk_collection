<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Word Viewer 97, if you attempt to open a document from the
Open dialog box (on the File menu, click Open) by typing a UNC (Universal
Naming Convention) path to a directory, you may receive an Invalid Page
Fault.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when you are working on an NT network share and all of
the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>The server containing the document is in a different domain than the
   domain you are currently validated on.

<LI>You have been granted adequate permissions to access the document.

<LI>You do not have a mapped drive to the server and share containing the
   document.
<P>
</UL>If it was working correctly, once you typed in the UNC location to the file
and attempted to open the file, NT would display a dialog box asking for
your domain and password. If the information you supplied was correct and
if you had been given permissions to access the file, the document would
open.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, use one of the following methods.
<P>
Method 1:
<P>
Map a drive to the server and share containing the document, and then open
the document using the drive letter (rather than the UNC path).
<P>
Method 2:

<OL><P><LI>Connect to the server and share from Windows Explorer and copy the
   document.

<P><LI>Connect to a server and share in a domain that you are currently
   validated on, and paste the document there.
<P>
</OL>You should be able to open the document using a UNC path to the server and
share on which you are validated.
<P>
Method 3:

<OL><P><LI>Connect to the server and share from Windows Explorer and copy the
   document.

<P><LI>Paste the document to your local hard disk and open it from there.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this
problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base as it becomes available.
