<UL><LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If the "Track changes while editing" option is selected in the Highlight
Changes dialog box, revision bars (also called "changed lines") may be
displayed or printed in an unexpected location. There are four forms of
this problem:
<P>
Case 1: The revision marks are printed in the right margin if the Mirror
<PRE>        Margins check box is not selected in the Page Setup dialog box.

</PRE>Case 2: Right border revision marks appear on the left side of text in
<PRE>        normal and outline views.

</PRE>Case 3: If text or table cells extend into the margins (as with a negative
<PRE>        left or right paragraph indent), the revision marks are printed
        over the top of the text that extends into the margins.

</PRE>Case 4: When a document is formatted with multiple columns and you specify
<PRE>        left border revision marks, the revision marks appear to the left
        of each column but are printed along the left edge of the page
        (instead of being printed along the left side of the edited
        column).

        When a document is formatted with multiple columns and you specify
        right border revision marks, the revision marks appear to the
        right of each column but are printed along the right edge of the
        page.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE/WORKAROUND/STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Case 1 (Border prints in wrong margin)</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   Cause
   -----

   This problem occurs if the Mirror Margins option is not selected.

   Workarounds
   -----------

   Method 1: Use a left or right border instead of an outside border. (To
             locate the border options, click Options on the Tools menu
             and select the Track Changes tab. Under Changed Lines, select
             the type of border you want to use to mark the revisions.)

             The drawback to using this method is that Word displays and
             prints the border in the same margin throughout the entire
             document.

   Method 2: Use a right border and print the odd pages. Then, use a left
             border and print the even pages. To do this,

             a. On the Tools menu, click Options, and click the Track
                Changes tab.

             b. Under Changed lines, select Right Border from the Mark
                box and click OK.

             c. Print the odd pages. (At the bottom of the Print dialog
                box, select Odd Pages, and then click OK.)

             d. On the Tools menu, click Options, and click the Track
                Changes tab.

             e. Under Changed lines, select Left Border from the Mark
                box and click OK.

             f. Print the even pages. (At the bottom of the Print dialog
                box, select Even Pages, and then click OK.)

   Status
   ------

   Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
   listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
   and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
   becomes available.

</PRE>Case 2 (Right revision marks appear on left)
 
<P>
<PRE>   Cause
   -----

   Word displays right revision marks on the right side of a document in
   page layout view and print preview, which are designed to display text
   the way it will be printed. In normal and outline views, Word displays
   revision marks to the left of the text to make editing easier.

   Resolution
   ----------

   To view the right revision marks, switch to page layout view or print
   preview.

</PRE>Case 3 (Revision marks print over text in margin)
 
<P>
<PRE>   Workaround
   ----------

   Modify the text so that it does not extend into the margin.

   Status
   ------

   Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
   listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
   and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
   becomes available.

</PRE><h3>Case 4 (Revision lines print only along left column)</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   Workaround
   ----------

   There is no workaround currently available.

   Status
   ------

   Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here
   in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
