<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use wildcards with the Find or Replace command (on the Edit menu),
you receive one of the following messages:
<P>
<PRE>   When You Click Replace All
   --------------------------

      Word has completed it's search of the document and has made 0
      replacements.

   When you click Find, Find Next, or Replace
   ------------------------------------------

      Word has finished searching the document. The search item was not
      found.

</PRE>These messages may appear although the text you are searching to replace
exists in the document.
<P>
For example:
<P>
To find and replace all occurrences of words beginning with the character
"s" and ending with the character "t," as in the word "sat," in the Find
text box you would type "s*t" (without the quotation marks). You must use
wildcards for this search to work. For example, in this case, the asterisk
is used as a wildcard that will find any string of characters between the
starting and ending specified characters.
<P>
NOTE: To use wildcards you must turn on the Use Wildcards option. To turn
on Use Wildcards, while in the Find or Replace dialog box, click the More
button and click to select the Use Wildcards check box.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
By design, when you use wildcards to search for text, the search text is
case sensitive. This is true even when the Match Case check box is not
selected. The text you are searching may contain a mixture of uppercase and
lowercase characters. That is, as described in the example mentioned
earlier in this article, if you search for "s*t" and the text in your
document is, for example, "Sat" (note the capital S), Word will not find
the text because it is looking for a lowercase "s", as in "sat."
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this behavior, search for all combinations of both lowercase
and uppercase characters.
<P>
For example, to find all occurrences of words beginning with the character
"s" and ending with the character "t," as in the word "sat," search the
following combinations:
<P>
<PRE>   s*t

   S*t

   S*T

   s*T

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
For more information about finding text, click the Office Assistant, type
"Why can't Word find the item I'm searching for?" click Search, and then
click to view "Why can't Word find the item I'm searching for?"
<P>
NOTE: If the Assistant is hidden, click the Office Assistant button on the
Standard toolbar. If Microsoft Help is not installed on your computer,
