The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The OrganizationalChartMaker macro in Word 6.0 does not allow you to insert
text in addition to the actual organizational chart. This article tells how
to add text to an organizational chart created by this macro.
<P>
This macro is provided in the MACRO60.DOT template located in the
&lt;WINWORD&gt;\MACROS subdirectory. It allows you to create organizational chart
based on the text you have formatted with Heading styles. It creates text
boxes on the drawing layer of Word for each of your entries. You can add
additional text to the created document after you run the macro.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If you want to add text above the organizational chart, you must select the
drawing objects of the chart and group them together so that they can be
easily moved as one object. To move the objects and add the text, start
with step 1 of the following procedure. If you don't need to move the
objects but only add text, begin with step 5.

<OL><P><LI>Choose the Drawing button from the Standard toolbar. This will make the
   Drawing toolbar available to you.

<P><LI>Choose the Select Drawing Objects button. Position the mouse in the
   upper-left corner of the drawing objects that you want to move. Hold
   down the left mouse button and drag the mouse pointer to the lower-right
   corner of the drawing objects to be moved. This causes a dashed box to
   be placed around the drawing objects.

<P><LI>Once the drawing objects have been selected in step 2, select the Group
   button from the Drawing toolbar. This action groups the individual
   drawing objects into one object. The selection handles should now
   surround the entire selected area and not the individual drawing
   objects.

<P><LI>With the selection handles visible, position the mouse pointer over one
   side of the selection area. The mouse pointer will have a four-ended
   arrow at its base. Hold down the left mouse button down and drag and
   drop the grouped object to the its new location.

<P><LI>Using the Drawing toolbar, select the Text Box button. Position the
   mouse pointer at the location where the new text box is to be added and
   using the left mouse button, drag and draw a new text box to the desired
   size. With the insertion point in the newly drawn text box, add the
   desired text.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: Using the Text Box button from the Drawing toolbar is one method of
adding text. You can create a different effect by using the Callout button
on the Drawing toolbar. For more information on creating a callout, see the
"Microsoft Word User's Guide" (Chapter 16 "Importing and Creating
Graphics," "Creating a Callout").
