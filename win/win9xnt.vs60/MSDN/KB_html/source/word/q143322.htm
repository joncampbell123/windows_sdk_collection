The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Internet Assistant for Word, version 2.0z
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows 95, versions 7.0, 7.0a
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows NT, version 6.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you browse a URL, Internet Assistant displays the page differently
from other browsers. In addition, the HTML code that is received by
Internet Assistant may be different from what other browsers receive.
<P>
The most common symptom may be that pages that use tables to enhance
their layout will not send the table information to Internet Assistant.
This will make it appear that Internet Assistant does not support
displaying tables.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Each Web browser identifies itself to the sever when requesting
information. Servers may have the ability to change the content sent based
on what it thinks the identified browser can display.
<P>
Internet Assistant may receive different information from the server when
the server does not recognize or correctly respond to requests from the
Internet Assistant.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the way servers reply to
requests for information from Microsoft Internet Assistant for Word,
version 2.0z. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this problem, report the problem to the server owner and request
that they tailor their server's responses to recognize Internet Assistant
user agent identification.
