The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a, 2.0, 2.0a,
   2.0a-CD, 2.0b, 2.0c, 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you insert a table in a Microsoft Word for Windows document, each
cell in the table assumes the paragraph formatting of the paragraph
where the insertion point is located when you insert the table. This
behavior may produce unexpected results in the display of text in the
table. To check the formatting specified for the paragraph containing
the insertion point, choose Paragraph from the Format menu.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
A common example of this problem occurs when the paragraph containing
the insertion point is formatted with a non-zero left or right indent.
If you insert a table at this point, each cell contains indents, and
the contents of the cells may align unexpectedly. When you apply an
indent to table cells, the indent is measured from the boundary of
each cell, not from the document margin.
<P>
With the ruler's indent scale active, you can view the ruler to check
for paragraph indents before you insert the table. You can also check
for indents in individual cells after you insert the table. If more
than one cell in the table is selected, the ruler reflects the indents
for the top-left cell of the selection, and the triangular indent
markers are unavailable, signifying that they do not apply to the
whole selection.
<P>
For a more precise view of the indents choose Paragraph from the
Format menu, and consider the follow conditions:

<UL><LI>If the left indent is less than the cell width and the combined
   indents are greater than the width of the cell, any text in the cell
   appears in a one-character wide column, positioned at the left indent.

<LI>If the left indent is larger than the width of the cell, no text
   displays, regardless of the value of any other indents.

<LI>If the indent values are smaller than the width of the cell (but not
   zero), the indents are made from the left and/or right cell boundaries
   (just as normal paragraphs are indented from the left and/or right
   margins).
<P>
</UL><h3>Word for Windows Version 2.0</h3>
 
<P>
If you use the Format Paragraph command to set left and/or right
paragraph indents for an existing table cell and the indents you
specify narrow the cell or paragraph to less than approximately
.7-inch, you receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   This indent is too large.

</PRE>If you attempt to set a first-line indent beyond the end of the cell
or paragraph (as determined by the right indent), you receive the same
error message.
<P>
You do not receive any error messages if you use the ruler to set the
same paragraph indents.
<P>
<P><h3>Word for Windows Versions 1.x</h3>
 
<P>
In Word for Windows version 1.x, you can specify any left, right, or
first-line paragraph indent value(s) within an existing table cell,
regardless of its relationship to the cell width and regardless of
whether you set the indents using the ruler or the Format Paragraph
command. No error messages appear in reference to conflicts in table
cell indentations. In Word version 1.x, the error message "Indentation
too large" appears only in reference to settings that conflict with
page margin and width settings.
<P>
Workaround
 
<P>
You can quickly reset all paragraph indents affecting a table by using
the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>With the insertion point positioned in the table, select the whole
   table by pressing ALT+Keypad 5 (with NUM LOCK off).

<P><LI>From the Format menu, choose Paragraph.

<P><LI>Type 0 (zero) in all three Indent boxes, and choose the OK button.
<P>
</OL>While paragraph indents are probably the most common cause of
misalignment in table cells, other paragraph formatting can affect
table cells. For more information on table formatting, query on the
following words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   paragraph and line and spacing and table and row and winword
