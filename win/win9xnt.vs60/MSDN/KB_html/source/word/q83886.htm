<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If you use the Setup program in Microsoft Word version 2.0 for Windows
to install Microsoft Equation Editor version 1.0 in the Microsoft
Windows operating system version 3.1, the Setup program does not
install the following Equation Editor TrueType fonts correctly:
<P>
<PRE>   MT Extra
   Fences

</PRE>These fonts appear in the Installed Fonts list in the Fonts dialog box
of the Control Panel, but they do not appear in the Sample box when
selected. To use these fonts, you must reinstall them using one of the
procedures listed below.
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Word version 2.0 for
Windows. This problem was corrected in Word version 2.0a for Windows.
<P>
Note: This problem does not occur when you use the Setup program in
Word version 2.0a for Windows or with any other TrueType fonts.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Equation Editor, which ships with Microsoft Word
versions 2.0 and 2.0a for Windows, comes with two TrueType fonts, MT
Extra and Fences. These TrueType fonts are designed for use with the
Windows operating system version 3.1. To use these fonts, the Equation
Editor must be installed after the installation of Windows 3.1.
Microsoft Windows version 3.0 does not use TrueType fonts; therefore,
these fonts are not installed when you run the Word for Windows Setup
program in Windows version 3.0.
<P>
If you use the Setup program in Word version 2.0 for Windows to
reinstall the Equation Editor after installing Windows 3.1 (in order
to add the TrueType version of the Equation Editor fonts), MT Extra
and Fences are installed incorrectly. Although these fonts appear in
the Installed Fonts box in the Fonts dialog box of the Control Panel,
the Sample box is empty when you select MT Extra of Fences.
Additionally, these two fonts are unavailable in Word for Windows and
Microsoft Windows Write.
<P>
To correctly install the MT Extra and Fences TrueType fonts, use one
of the following methods:

<UL><LI>In the Control Panel, choose the Fonts icon. In the Fonts dialog
   box, select MT Extra, and choose the Remove button. In the Remove Font
   box, clear the Delete Font File From Disk option, and choose the Yes
   button. Repeat this process for the Fences font. Choose the Add
   button. In the Directories box, select the Windows \SYSTEM
   subdirectory, and choose the OK button. In the List of Fonts box,
   select MT Extra Plain (TrueType) and Fences Plain (TrueType), then
   choose the OK button. Choose the Close button to exit the Fonts dialog
   box. Exit and restart Windows.
<P>
   Note: The newly added font names are Fences Plain and MT Extra Plain.
   The Equation Editor works correctly with these fonts.

</PRE>
<LI>In the Control Panel, choose the Fonts icon. In the Fonts dialog
   box, select MT Extra, and choose the Remove button. In the Remove Font
   box, check the Delete Font File From Disk option, and choose the Yes
   button. Repeat this process for the Fences font. Using the Word for
   Windows version 2.0a Setup program, reinstall the Equation Editor.
   Exit and restart Windows.
