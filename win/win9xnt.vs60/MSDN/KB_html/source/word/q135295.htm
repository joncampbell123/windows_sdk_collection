The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows 95, version 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Word for Windows 95 includes a component called WordMail that allows you to
create new Exchange messages using most of the features in Word. If you are
using Exchange as your e-mail client interface and have Word and the
WordMail component installed on your computer, you can use WordMail as your
e-mail editor.
<P>
Disabling WordMail can be an important part of troubleshooting e-mail-
related problems. Testing an e-mail problem after you disable WordMail will
help you determine whether the problem is with Word or with the Exchange
client in general.
<P>
To run WordMail with adequate performance, 12 MB of RAM is recommended.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The order of installation determines whether WordMail is enabled
automatically:

<UL><LI>If Exchange is installed first and Word is installed second, WordMail is
   automatically enabled.

<LI>If Word is installed first, and Exchange is installed second, WordMail
   is not enabled, and the menu item for enabling WordMail is not available
   in Exchange.
<P>
</UL>To enable or disable WordMail, use the appropriate steps, depending on
which program was installed first:
<P>
<P><h3>If Exchange was installed first</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start Exchange.

<P><LI>On the Compose menu, click WordMail Options.

<P><LI>Check or clear the "Enable Word as Email Editor" check box.

<P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
</OL><h3>If Word was installed first</h3>
 
<P>
Method 1: Run Setup with the /y switch:
<P>
<PRE>          a. Insert the Word or Office Setup Disk #1 in your floppy disk
             drive.

          b. Click the Start button and then click Run.

          c. In the Open box, type the following:

                &lt;drive&gt;:\setup /Y

             where &lt;drive&gt; is the letter of the drive that contains Setup
             Disk #1.

          d. Click OK.

          e. Click Reinstall.

          This will re-register Word (and all Office applications, if you
          run Office Setup). The WordMail Options will now be available on
          the Compose menu in Exchange.

</PRE></OL>Method 2: If Method 1 does not work, or is not feasible in your situation,
<PRE>          modify the Registry.

          For information about how to edit the registry, view the Changing
          Keys And Values online Help topic in Registry Editor
          (Regedit.exe). Note that you should make a backup copy of the
          registry files (System.dat and User.dat) before you edit the
          Registry.

          WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious
          problems that may require you to reinstall Windows 95. Microsoft
          cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use
          of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own
          risk.

          a. Locate the following key in the Registry:

                HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Exchange
                \Client\Extensions

          b. Create a new String Value and name it WordMail

          c. Modify the value WordMail to be the following:

                4.0;&lt;Path to word&gt;\Wordmail\wordmail.dll;1;10000000000001

          d. Create a new String Value and name it Stationery.

          e. Modify the value Stationery to be the following:

                4.0;&lt;Path to Winword&gt;\Wordmail\station.dll;1

             The result should be two new String Values similar to the
             following:

</PRE> 
<PRE>Name       Data

</PRE>Stationery "4.0;C:\MSOffice\Winword\Wordmail\station.dll;1"
<PRE>WordMail   "4.0;C:\MSOffice\Winword\Wordmail\wordmail.dll;1;10000000000001"
</PRE> 
<P>
<PRE>          f. Start Exchange. The WordMail Options will now be available on
             the Compose menu in Exchange.
