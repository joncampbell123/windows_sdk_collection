The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you fax multiple form letters using the Fax Wizard, all of the cover
sheets are faxed first, then the form letter is faxed. The side-effect of
this is that if you have a large number of faxes to send, the recipient may
receive other faxes between the time they get your cover sheet and the time
they get the form letter.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, choose one of the following methods:
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1</h3>
 
<P>
Merge fewer documents when merging to fax.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 2</h3>
 
<P>
Create a mail merge main document that includes a cover sheet and then
merge to fax.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as soon
as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Even when faxing a single document using the Fax Wizard, 2 documents are
created; one is the fax cover sheet and the other is the document you wish to
fax. When the fax is sent, it will be sent as 2 separate faxes; the cover
sheet and the document.
<P>
This problem is most noticeable when merging to electronic fax because more
documents and cover sheets are involved.
