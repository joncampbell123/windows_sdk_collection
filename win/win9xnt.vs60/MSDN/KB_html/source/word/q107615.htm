The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, version 6.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
An hourglass pointer may appear and your computer may hang (stop
responding) if you choose the Address button in a New Message window after
you start Lotus CC:Mail version 2.0 using the Send command on the File menu
in Word for Windows. If you then press CTRL+ALT+DEL, Windows displays the
following error message:
<P>
<PRE>  winword.EXE has stopped responding to the system.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Your computer hangs because the Lotus CC:Mail file VIM.DLL conflicts with
the MAPIVIM.DLL file supplied with Word.
<P>
Use the following procedure to check which version of MAPIVIM.DLL is
installed on your computer:

<OL><P><LI>In Windows File Manager, switch to the \WINDOWS\SYSTEM subdirectory.

<P><LI>Select the MAPIVIM.DLL file.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Properties.

<P><LI>In the "Properties for MAPIVIM.DLL" dialog box, you should see a line
   that reads:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Version: 1.0.0.xx
</PRE><P>
   where xx is a number.
<P>
</OL><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To prevent this error from occurring, you must use a MAPIVIM.DLL file whose
version is 1.0.0.63 or later, with a file date of 1/14/94 or later. This
file is included with the following programs:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows versions 6.0a and later
<LI>Microsoft PowerPoint version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Office version 4.2
<LI>International versions of Microsoft Excel version 5.0
<P>
</UL>Or, you can obtain a copy of the .dll from a Microsoft Excel Application
Note. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../excel/q112730.htm">Q112730</A></B>
   TITLE     : XL5: AppNote: MAPI-to-VIM Translation .DLL MAPIVIM.DLL

</PRE></OL>Once you have downloaded the new MAPIVIM.DLL file, copy it to your
WINDOWS\SYSTEM folder and then restart Microsoft Windows to start using the
new file.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Word for Windows. This
problem was corrected in versions 6.0a and later of Word for Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If you have the version of MAPIVIM.DLL that shipped with the U.S. domestic
version of Microsoft Excel 5.0 or with Word 6.0, you can prevent Word from
trying to retrieve the address list by adding the line
<P>
<PRE>   MAPIVIMDisableABScan=1

</PRE>to the [Mail] section of your WIN.INI file.
