The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a, 2.0, 2.0a,

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If you copy or cut a selection of text from a Microsoft Word for
Windows document to the Clipboard and paste it into another
application, the text may appear differently in that application than
if you paste it into a Word for Windows document.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you cut or copy text from Word for Windows, Word tells the
Clipboard in Windows the formats it can provide the data in. Word does
not actually give a copy of the data to the Clipboard until another
application asks for it.
<P>
If Word for Windows pastes data that you cut or copy during the
current session of Word for Windows, it always uses the internal Word
for Windows clipboard or document scrap area. Pasting data into
another session of Word for Windows or into another application causes
the data to go through the Windows Clipboard in RTF format, which
includes line breaks.
<P>
The difference between pasting from the Clipboard in Windows and
pasting from the Word for Windows internal clipboard can be
demonstrated by copying and pasting a column selection (text selected
with the right mouse button or by pressing CTRL+SHIFT+F8) from a Word
for Windows document into another Word for Windows document and into a
document in another application. The text pasted into a non-Word for
Windows documents includes linefeeds at the end of each line. The text
pasted into a Word for Windows document does NOT include linefeeds.
