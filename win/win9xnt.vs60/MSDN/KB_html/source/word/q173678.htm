<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you undo the dragging of an AutoShape or Text Box object from one
document to another (shown as Move Object in the list of actions you can
undo), you may receive unexpected results.
<P>
<P><h3>Case 1: Dragging an AutoShape</h3>
 
<P>
When you click Undo, the AutoShape reappears in the original document but
does not disappear from the second document.
<P>
<P><h3>Case 2: Dragging a Text Box</h3>
 
<P>
When you click Undo, the Text Box disappears from the second document, but
does not reappear in the original document.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, click Undo in both documents. To do this,
follow these steps.

<OL><P><LI>Immediately after dragging the object, click the Undo button on the
   Standard toolbar.

<P><LI>Click the mouse pointer in the other document to make that document
   active.

<P><LI>Click the Undo button on the Standard toolbar.
<P>
</OL>The object reappears in the original document, and disappears from the
second document.
<P>
Resolution:
<P>
To prevent this problem from occurring, drag the paragraph that the object
is anchored to instead of just dragging the object. To do this, follow
these steps.
<P>
NOTE: If you need to show both documents, click Arrange All on the Window
menu.

<OL><P><LI>Select the text (including the paragraph mark) of the paragraph that
   contains the object's anchor.
<P>
   NOTE: Make sure there are at least two paragraphs in the document, and
   that you select the correct paragraph mark. To show paragraph marks,
   press the Show/Hide button on the Standard toolbar.

<P><LI>Drag the text to the second document. Both the text and AutoShape object
   are moved.
<P>
</OL>The Undo button now makes the object reappear in the original document, and
disappear from the second document.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Word 97 for
Windows. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
