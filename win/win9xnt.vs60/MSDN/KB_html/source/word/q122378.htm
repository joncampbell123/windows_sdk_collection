The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for the Macintosh, versions 6.0, 6.0.1, 6.0.1a
</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article explains when and how to rebuild the Registration Database
files on the Macintosh operating system. This troubleshooting step rules
out the possibility that the Registration Database files are damaged
(corrupted).
<P>
<P><h3>When to Rebuild the Registration Databases</h3>
 
<P>
You may want to rebuild the Registration Databases as part of normal
troubleshooting for the following problems (this list is not exclusive):

<UL><LI>OLE 2.0 problems (not OLE 1.0 problems)

<LI>Maintenance mode setup problems in which the Microsoft Word Setup
   program incorrectly indicates that items have not been installed when,
   in fact, they are installed.

<LI>Word cannot locate its Help files. Word prompts you for the location of
   the Word Help file, even when the Help files are correctly installed in
   the Word Folder. If rebuilding the Macintosh Desktop does not resolve
   this problem, then you should rebuild the Registration Database files.
<P>
</UL><h3>How to Rebuild the Registration Database</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Quit any open programs.

<P><LI>Open the Preferences Folder in the System Folder.

<P><LI>Back up the Registration Database file  by copying it to a floppy disk.

<P><LI>Delete the Registration Database file and the PPC Registration
   Database file from the Preferences:System Folder on your hard disk.

<P><LI>Close the System Folder.

<P><LI>Open the Microsoft Folder, which is located at the same level as the
   Word 6 folder.

<P><LI>Double-click each program in the Microsoft Folder to register it.

<P><LI>Start Word to register it.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you install a program, Setup registers the application in the
Registration Database file and the PPC Registration Database file. The
Registration Database file and the PPC Registration Database file also
contains information about OLE 2.0 functionality.
<P>
NOTE: The Embedding Preferences file contains information regarding OLE 1.0
functionality. If you delete either the Registration Database, the PPC
Registration Database, or the Embedding Preferences file, the system
re-creates the file when you start an OLE 1.0 or OLE 2.0 program. However,
rebuilding the Registration Database files will have the following effects:

<UL><LI>The ClipArt Gallery does not register and is therefore not available
   from PowerPoint. The only workaround is to re-install PowerPoint.

<LI>The Custom dictionary will be missing from Word. To re-establish the
   Custom Dictionary, choose Options from the Tools menu, click the Spell
   tab, click Add, browse to the correct folder, and select the Custom
   dictionary.

<LI>Maintenance mode is lost and no longer accessible. There is no
   workaround for this at this time. The only option is to re-install
   Office.
<P>
</UL>All other OLE Objects re-register without any problems.
