The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for the Macintosh, versions 6.0, 6.0.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has identified some problems when running Word for Macintosh 6.0
with some utilities in the Now Utilities package. These problems are
detailed below:
<P>
<P><h3>NowMenus</h3>
 

<UL><LI>The Undo (COMMAND+Z) and Repeat (COMMAND+Y) keystrokes may not work with
   NowMenus installed. NowMenus traps these keystrokes and doesn't relay
   this information to the application. To resolve this issue update to
   Now Utilities 5.0.1.
<P>
</UL><h3>Super Boomerang</h3>
 

<UL><LI>Super Boomerang's Re-Launch feature opens documents that you had open
   when you quit an application. Using this feature may cause Word to
   display the message, "Do you want to revert to the saved 'DOC1'?". Super
   Boomerang sends an extra (unnecessary) AppleEvent to open this document,
   causing Word to open a second copy of the file(s). Word alerts you when
   opening the same document twice, because the two versions of the file
   can be different.
<P>
</UL><h3>WYSIWYG Menus</h3>
 

<UL><LI>Now's WYSIWYG Menus utility may show more than one font selected at a
   time (check mark by the font name) on the font menu. To add the Font
   menu, run the AddFontMenu macro, located in the 5.1 Upgrade template in
   the Macro folder.

<LI>Fonts ending with the word "Chancery" may be truncated if the
   AddFontMenu macro is run with WYSIWYG Menus enabled. To keep this from
   occurring, disable WYSIWYG Menus, restart the Macintosh, start Word, and
   run the AddFontMenu macro.

<LI>If you access the Font menu from the keyboard (MenuMode), WYSIWYG Menus
   will not show fonts listed in their respective font format on the Font
   menu. For example, the word "Times" will not display on the Font menu in
   the Times font. To activate MenuMode, press COMMAND+TAB. To add the Font
   menu, run the AddFontMenu macro, located in the Macro template.
