The information in this article applies to:

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When performing a print merge, you may want to skip a certain number
of records in the data document. One method may seem to be to format
those records as hidden text to keep them from printing. However, when
you perform the print merge, all records, including those formatted as
hidden text, appear. This method gives unsatisfactory results as
follows.
<P>
<P><h3>Word 5.x</h3>
 
<P>
In Word, if you apply the hidden text attribute to fields or
records in a data file, the hidden text attribute will remain with the
information as it is merged. This may or may not create a desirable
result. For example, if you are merging to make form letters, a letter
will still print for each record, even if a record is completely
composed of hidden text. If only some fields in a record are formatted
as hidden text, those fields will carry through to the form letter,
but will not print since they are formatted as hidden text. All other
formatting in the data document will not be carried over into the
merge.
<P>
<P><h3>Word Versions 3.x and 4.0</h3>
 
<P>
All formatting in a data document will not be applied to a print
merged document. Any hidden text formatting in the data document will
be ignored during the print merge.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To print a range of records, specify a range in the Print Merge dialog
box, or highlight the range of records you want to print and copy and
paste them into a new data document.
<P>
NOTE: If you use the latter method, you must change the name of the
data document in the DATA statement to match that of your new data
document.
