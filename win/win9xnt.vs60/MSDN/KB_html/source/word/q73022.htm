The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a, 2.0, 2.0a,
   2.0a-CD, 2.0b, 2.0c, 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If you use the INCLUDE field to insert the contents of one document
into another document in Microsoft Word for Windows version 1.0, 1.1,
or 1.1a, the last paragraph in the source document acquires the
formatting that is used in the paragraph containing the INCLUDE field.
To preserve the formatting of the source document's final paragraph,
apply the desired formatting to the paragraph that contains the
INCLUDE field.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If you insert the contents of one document into another document using
the INCLUDE field, the last paragraph mark of the source document is
replaced by the paragraph mark that follows the paragraph containing
the INCLUDE field in the destination document.
<P>
If you format the paragraph containing the INCLUDE field with the same
formatting that is applied to the last paragraph of the source
document, the formatting of the last paragraph in the source document
does not change when you include it.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Type two lines of text in a blank document.

<P><LI>From the Format menu, choose Paragraph, and type "2" (without the
   quotation marks) in the Line box under Spacing.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Save, name the document, and choose the
   OK button.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose New, and choose the OK button.

<P><LI>From the Insert menu, choose File. Select the Link check box,
   select the file created above, and choose the OK button.
<P>
</OL>The included text is single-spaced. To correct the problem, select the
paragraph that contains the INCLUDE field and change its formatting to
double-spaced.
<P>
Word for Windows version 2.0 retains the source document's last
paragraph mark when it is included so that it is unnecessary to format
the paragraph containing the INCLUDE field.
