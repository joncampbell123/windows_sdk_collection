<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you attempt to compile a Word 97 Rich Text Format (RTF) file in the
Help Compiler that ships with Microsoft Visual C++ 4.0 or the Microsoft
Visual C++ 4.2 Help Workshop, you may receive the following messages:
<P>
<PRE>   HC4002: Warning:
        The RTF file .\&lt;filename&gt; is corrupted at offset &lt;###&gt;

   HC4005: Warning:
        The .\&lt;filename&gt; help file has not been created.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
RTF readers should ignore RTF flags that they do not understand. Word 97
writes a few new RTF flags. The older Help Compilers are not correctly
discarding the new RTF flags and are attempting to process them. Since the
flags are new, the Help Compiler is failing during the compilation process.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
This problem is corrected in Help Workshop version 4.03, which is available
for download from the Microsoft Software Library:
<P>
<PRE> ~ <A href="http://support.microsoft.com/download/support/mslfiles/hcwsetup.exe">Hcwsetup.exe</A> <I>(size: 1596080 bytes)</I>

   TITLE     : How to Obtain Microsoft Support Files from Online Services

</PRE>An updated Help Workshop version 4.02 is available through the following
sources:
<P>
Microsoft Office 97, Developer Edition.
<P>
Microsoft Developer Network - Library - Jan 97
<PRE>     Updated Microsoft Help Workshop 4.02\HELPSHOP\SETUP.EXE

</PRE>Microsoft Visual C++ for Windows Version 5
<PRE>     Emterprise and Professional Editions
     \DevStudio\Vc\Unsupported Tools\Hcw

</PRE>NOTE: Visual Studio 97 ships the older 4.01 compiler.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Help Workshop is a program that you use to create Help (.hlp) files, edit
project and contents files, and test and report on help files. Help
Workshop takes the information in the project (.hpj) file to combine the
topic (.rtf) files, bitmaps, and other sources into one Help file that can
be viewed using the Microsoft Windows Help program.
<P>
Help WorkShop 4.02 will compile help files from RTF written both by the 16-
bit versions of Word, such as Word 6.0, and also the 32-bit versions such
as Word 7.0 and Word 97.
<P>
Help Workshop 4.02 will not compile projects created in the MS-DOS version
of the Help Compiler.
<P>
A help file created in Help Workshop 4.02 will not run under Windows 3.x
because the Help Workshop 4.02 creates 32-bit help files and Windows 3.x is
a 16-bit operating environment.
