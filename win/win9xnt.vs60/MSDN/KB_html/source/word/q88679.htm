The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a, 2.0, 2.0a,
   2.0a-CD, 2.0b, 2.0c, 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Word for Windows, you can use the asterisk (*) and the
question mark (?) wildcard characters as part of a selective print
merge operation. These wildcards function in Word for Windows similar
to the way they function in Microsoft MS-DOS (that is, they act as a
substitute for a letter, number, or string).
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The asterisk (*) wildcard character represents a whole word or a group
of characters, regardless of length. For example, "D*" (without the
quotation marks) represents any group of characters that begins with
the letter D, regardless of the length of the string. And, "*D"
represents any group of characters that ends with the letter D,
regardless of its length.
<P>
Note: You cannot search for a string that both begins with an asterisk
and ends with an asterisk; therefore, "*D*" is an invalid selection
criteria.
<P>
The question mark (?) wildcard represents a single character. For
example, "?D" represents any string that contains one character before
the letter D, such as "ID." And, "?D?" represents any string with one
character before and one character after the letter D, such as "IDE."
<P>
While the asterisk (*) wildcard character can successfully merge data
that begins with numbers, the question mark (?) wildcard character
cannot. For example, you could use "98*" during a print merge, but not
"98???".
<P>
<P><h3>Using Wildcards to Perform Selective Print Merge</h3>
 
<P>
Note: In the following samples, create the field braces by pressing
CTRL+F9.

<UL><LI>To select records whose First_Name merge field begins with "D", use
   the following syntax in your print merge main document:
<P>
<P><PRE>      {if {First_Name}="D*" "{First_Name}"}
</PRE>
<LI>To select records whose First_Name merge field ends with "D":
<P>
<P><PRE>      {if {First_Name}="*D" "{First_Name}"}
</PRE>
<LI>To selectively merge those records whose First_Name merge field
   begins with "D" and contain four characters:
<P>
<P><PRE>      {if {First_Name}="D???" "{First_Name}"}
</PRE><P>
</UL>Note: In a Word for Windows print merge operation, the characters
inside the quotation marks are case sensitive. In the above examples,
records whose First_Name merge field contains "D" would be found,
whereas records whose First_Name merge field contains "d" would not be
found.
<P>
For information on using wildcards to perform a selective print merge
in which a numeric character follows the wildcard, query on the
following words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   numeric and and wildcard and incorrect

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Word for Windows versions
2.0, 2.0a, 2.0a-CD, 2.0b, 2.0c, 6.0, 6.0a, and 6.0c. This problem was
corrected in Word version 7.0 for Windows 95.
