The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article discusses the Drawing Objects and Picture Placeholders
settings. You can use these settings to control how quickly a document is
displayed on screen and how it is printed.
<P>
In some cases, adjusting these settings may help you troubleshoot problems
such as clipart or some other drawing object not printing or your document
displaying slowly. These settings also allow you to print only the text of
a document that includes drawing objects.
<P>
<P><h2>THE DRAWING OBJECTS SETTING</h2>
 
<P>
Use this setting to control how quickly documents that contain drawing
objects are printed or whether or not drawing objects are printed at all.
<P>
This setting affects objects in the drawing layer only; it will not affect
any object in the text layer of your document.
<P>
<P><h3>Accessing the Drawing Objects Setting</h3>
 
<P>
To access the Drawing Objects setting, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Options, and then select the Print tab.

<P><LI>Under Include With Document, click to select or clear the Drawing
   Objects check box.
<P>
</OL><h3>What Happens When the Setting Is On (the Check Box Is Selected)</h3>
 
<P>
If this setting is turned on (selected), floating objects (Microsoft Word
97 for Windows) or any objects that you insert into your document from the
Drawing toolbar will be visible in page layout and print preview views. The
objects will not be visible in normal, outline, master document, or
Microsoft Word 97 online layout view. All objects will be printed.
<P>
<P><h3>What Happens When the Setting Is Off (the Check Box Is Cleared)</h3>
 
<P>
If this setting is turned off (the check box is cleared), drawing objects
will not be printed; therefore, the document should be printed faster.
<P>
The drawing objects will be visible in page layout view, but they will not
be visible in print preview and they will not be printed.
<P>
<P><h2>THE PICTURE PLACEHOLDERS SETTING</h2>
 
<P>
Use this setting to control the speed at which you can scroll through or
display a document that contains graphics.
<P>
This setting does not affect objects in the drawing layers of your
document, except for pictures inside a text box.
<P>
<P><h3>Accessing the Picture Placeholders Setting</h3>
 
<P>
To access the Picture Placeholders setting, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Options, and then select the View tab.

<P><LI>Under Show, click to select or clear the Picture Placeholders check box.
<P>
</OL>What Happens When the Setting Is On (the Check Box Is Selected)
 
<P>
If this setting is turned on (selected), any picture in the text layer of
your document or inside a text box will be displayed as an empty box when
viewed in page layout view. This will speed up scrolling through the
document in page layout view. In print preview and when you print the
document, the picture will be visible.
<P>
<P><h3>What Happens When the Setting Is Off (the Check Box Is Cleared)</h3>
 
<P>
If this setting is turned off (the check box is cleared), all pictures will
be displayed and printed correctly; however, scrolling through the document
may be slower.
