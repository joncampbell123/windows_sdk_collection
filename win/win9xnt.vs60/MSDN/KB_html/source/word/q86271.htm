The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 2.0, 2.0a, 2.0a-CD, 2.0b,
   2.0c
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Word for Windows, you may receive the following error message
if Word cannot locate or read the document's temporary (.TMP) file:
<P>
<PRE>   Unrecoverable Disk Error on File ~DOC####.TMP

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This error message usually occurs when you are working with a file
from a network drive or a floppy disk drive. The error message does
not disappear when you choose the Retry or Cancel button.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the versions of
Microsoft Word for Windows listed above. This problem was corrected
in Word version 6.0 for Windows.
<P>
To obtain new or updated Microsoft products, call the Microsoft Sales
Information Center at (800) 426-9400. If you are outside the United
States, contact the Microsoft subsidiary for your area. To locate
your subsidiary, call Microsoft International Customer Service at
(425) 936-8661.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Word creates a .TMP file in the current directory. The filename of a
.TMP file begins with the tilde character (~) and ends with a .TMP
extension. Word accesses this file while you work on your document. If
Word cannot access this file, Word will halt, and the error message
will be displayed.
<P>
<P><h3>Floppy Disk Drive</h3>
 
<P>
If your current directory is a floppy disk drive, this error will
occur after you remove the floppy disk where the .TMP file is located.
You must put the floppy disk back in the disk drive so that Word can
access the .TMP file.
<P>
To avoid this error message, copy your file from the floppy disk to
the hard drive. Open the file in Word from the hard drive; do not open
the file from the floppy disk. By working from the hard drive, you
ensure that the .TMP file can always be accessed by Word. When you
finish working on your document, copy it back to the floppy disk.
<P>
<P><h3>Network Drive</h3>
 
<P>
If your current directory is a network drive, this error will occur if
you do not have sufficient user rights in that directory. The message
may also occur if your connection to the network drive is disrupted.
You must have create, modify, and delete rights to a network directory
if it is the current directory. Word must be allowed to modify and
delete the .TMP files it creates; if Word is prevented from completing
these actions, the "Unrecoverable Disk Error on File ~DOC####.TMP"
error message will appear. See your network administrator to obtain
adequate user rights, or move your files to a different directory in
which you have adequate rights.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem (Floppy Disk)</h3>

    directories:

       A:\DIR1
