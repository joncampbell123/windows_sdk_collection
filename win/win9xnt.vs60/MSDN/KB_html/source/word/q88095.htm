The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, version 2.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you run the spelling checker in version 2.0 of Microsoft Word for
Windows and you add words to the custom dictionary (CUSTOM.DIC), the
spelling checker in other Microsoft applications may not recognize these
words. This problem occurs because Word for Windows uses a different
sorting order to sort the words in the custom dictionary than other
Microsoft applications. As a result, other Microsoft applications are not
able to find these words in the shared CUSTOM.DIC file.
<P>
Other Microsoft applications that share the CUSTOM.DIC file include:
Microsoft Excel for Windows, Microsoft Publisher for Windows, and Microsoft
Works for Windows.
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Word for Windows version
2.0. This problem was corrected in Word for Windows version 2.0a.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The spelling checker in version 2.0 of Word for Windows sorts words
starting with numbers followed by words in normal alphabetical order
(without regard to capitalization). The other Microsoft applications
that share CUSTOM.DIC sort words using the following, slightly
modified version of alphabetical order (based on the ASCII character
set):

<UL><LI>Numbers
<LI>Capital letters
<LI>Lowercase letters
<P>
</UL>When Word for Windows uses or creates CUSTOM.DIC, it resorts the words
in the file. As a result, the spelling engine of the other Microsoft
applications can no longer recognize the order, which causes
previously entered words to be flagged as misspelled.
<P>
The shared custom dictionary file, used by several Microsoft
Windows-based applications, is stored by default in the following
subdirectory:
<P>
<PRE>   C:\WINDOWS\MSAPPS\PROOF

</PRE>Note: If you move your shared CUSTOM.DIC file to another location, you
need to change the appropriate .INI settings for each application that
accesses this custom dictionary file. In Word for Windows, this
setting is located in the MS Proofing Tools section of the Windows
WIN.INI file.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Use the following procedure to repair a CUSTOM.DIC file created in
version 2.0 of Word for Windows:

<OL><P><LI>Open CUSTOM.DIC in Word for Windows. Choose the OK button when
   prompted to convert the file from Text Only.

<P><LI>Delete any words in capital letters from the file and retype them
   using one of the following methods:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Next time you use the spelling checker in one of the Microsoft
      applications that accesses CUSTOM.DIC, choose the Add button
      when the capitalized word is flagged. The spelling checker adds
      the word to CUSTOM.DIC in the correct order.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      -or-
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - After you complete step 3 below, type the words into CUSTOM.DIC.
      Add the words, in alphabetical order, after the numbered items
      and before the lowercase items. For example, add "Apple,"
      "Orange," and "Raspberry" to the following locations in
      CUSTOM.DIC:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>         286
         386SX
         486SX
         6.0a
         Apple
         Orange
         Raspberry
         apple
         octopus
         registration

</PRE><P><LI>From the Tools menu, choose Sorting. Select the Ascending Sorting
   Order option and choose the OK button.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Close. Choose the Yes button when
   prompted to save changes to the file.
<P>
</OL>The custom dictionary is now in a format that can be used by other
Microsoft applications.
<P>
If the spelling checker in another Microsoft application fails to
recognize words you added to CUSTOM.DIC from the version 2.0 Word for
Windows spelling checker, you should obtain version 2.0a of Word for
Windows.
