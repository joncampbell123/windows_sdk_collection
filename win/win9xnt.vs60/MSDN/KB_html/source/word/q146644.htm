The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
<LI>Microsoft Word for the Macintosh, versions 6.0, 6.0.1, 6.0.1a
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows NT, version 6.0
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows 95, versions 7.0, 7.0a

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
A mail merge main document that contains form fields retains the
drop-down and check box form fields, but text form fields are not
present in the merge result.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Word unlinks the text form fields during the mail merge. Word does not 
unlink display form fields, such as the drop-down and the check box form 
fields. This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>

</PRE>Instead of inserting text form fields into the mail merge main document,
insert a placeholder, merge to a new document, and then replace the
placeholder with the text form field. Use the following macro to
replace the placeholder with a text form field.
<P>
NOTE: The drawback to this method is that you cannot merge directly to a
printer; you must merge to a document, run the macro and then print the 
document.
<P>
<PRE>   Sub MAIN
      StartOfDocument
      ' Turn screen updating off.
      ScreenUpdating 0     
      ' Note that "&lt;TEXTFIELD&gt;" (below) needs to be whatever the user has as
      ' a temporary text form field "replacement" in their original merge
      ' document.
      EditFind .Find = "&lt;TEXTFIELD&gt;", .Direction = 0, .Wrap = 1
      ' This makes sure that there are actually more "fields" to replace
      ' before putting in a new form field. Without this it would endlessly
      ' insert text form fields at the end of the document.
      While EditFindFound()
        InsertFormField .Enable = 1, .TextType = 0, .TextWidth = "0"
        EditFind
      Wend
      ScreenUpdating 1   'Turn screen updating back on.
      StartOfDocument
   End Sub

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Some fields, such as the Next and FillIn fields require input either from
the data document or from you to continue processing the merge. In this
case, Word places the results in the merged document. However, fields that
obtain information from document statistics, such as the Numpages field,
may be inappropriate for a merged document. As a result they are not
retained in the merge result.
<P>
The following fields are not unlinked during a mail merge:
