The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a, 2.0, 2.0a,
   2.0a-CD, 2.0b, 2.0c, 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows 95, version 7.0

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Word for Windows, if you use the INCLUDETEXT field (INCLUDE in
2.x and prior) to insert the contents of one file (the source document)
into another file (the master document), headers and footers will be
affected by the following factors:

<UL><LI>The placement and type of section breaks in the source document.

<LI>The section breaks in the master document.

<LI>The placement of the INCLUDETEXT field in the master document.
<P>
</UL>This article describes the behavior of headers and footers in a master
document that contains INCLUDETEXT field(s).
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Headers and footers are section-level settings in Word for Windows;
therefore, you can change headers and footers by inserting a section
break and modifying the header/footer text in the second section.
However, predictable header/footer behavior is limited when you use
the INCLUDE field to insert a source document into a master document.
<P>
NOTE: The Different Odd and Even Pages setting in the Header/Footer
dialog box is a document-level setting. If the master document contains
this formatting, the source document will contain this formatting after
being included into the master document regardless of whether or not it
contained this formatting before being included. Additionally, if the
source document is formatted for Different Odd and Even Pages but the
master document does not contain this formatting, the included source
document will not contain this formatting.The Different First Page
setting in the Header/Footer dialog box is a section-level setting and
will be affected as outlined below.
<P>
<P><h3>Source Document Contains No Section Breaks</h3>
 
<P>
If your source document contains no section breaks, none of its
headers or footers will appear in the master document. The master
document headers/footers will continue throughout the source document.
<P>
<P><h3>Source Document Contains Continuous Section Break at End of Document</h3>
 
<P>
If your source document contains a continuous section break at the end
of the document, you can insert the source file into a master file and
retain the headers/footers of each file by using the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Insert a continuous section break at the end of the master
   document.

<P><LI>Insert a continuous section break at the end of the source
   document.

<P><LI>Use an INCLUDETEXT field to insert the source document BELOW the
   continuous section break in the master document.
<P>
</OL>This method works as long as the source document is inserted at the
end of the master document.
<P>
<P><h3>Unpredictable Combinations</h3>
 
<P>
If you include a source document in a master document in the middle of
a section or between two section breaks, you may obtain the following
results:

<UL><LI>If there is a section break at the beginning and/or end of the
   source document, an extra blank page may appear at the beginning
   and/or end of the source document when it is inserted into the master
   document.

<LI>If the header/footer of the source document is included in the
   master document, the header/footer of the master document may not
   resume following the source document (that is, the source document
   header/footer may continue throughout the remainder of the master
   document).

<LI>In Word 6.0 while creating a header/footer, if you choose the Same as
   Previous button, you can insert the source document into a new section
   without affecting the existing header in the following section.
