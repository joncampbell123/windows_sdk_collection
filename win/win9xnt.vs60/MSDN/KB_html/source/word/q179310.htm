The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Under extremely rare circumstances, when you type a long, complex sentence,
Word may unexpectedly quit and you will not be prompted to save any open
documents, or you may receive one of the following error messages:
<P>
<PRE>   Winword caused an Invalid Page Fault in module MSGREN32.dll at &lt;address&gt;

   -or-

   There was an unexpected error in the grammar checker. Word cannot
   complete the grammar check.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when the grammar checker attempts to evaluate a long,
complex sentence that includes several conjunctions such as "or" and "and"
along with at least one preposition such as "of," "to," "by," or "from."
<P>
NOTE: The chance of this error occurring is less than one in a million; so,
it is extremely unlikely that you will encounter this error.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has made available an updated version of the grammar checker. To
resolve this problem, obtain this updated grammar checker from the
Microsoft Software Library. The following file is available for download
from the Microsoft Software Library:
<P>
<PRE> ~ <A href="http://support.microsoft.com/download/support/mslfiles/gramupd.exe">Gramupd.exe</A> <I>(size: 644320 bytes)</I>
