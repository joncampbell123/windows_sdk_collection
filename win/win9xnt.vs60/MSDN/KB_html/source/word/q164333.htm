The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the Insert Address button and you search a large address
book, Word displays an hourglass and appears to hang.
<P>
NOTE: Word is actually searching the address book, but is taking a long
time to complete the search.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Word uses an algorithm to search the address book that is different from
the one Microsoft Outlook uses.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Use Microsoft Outlook to search your large address book.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To search the address book from Word:

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Envelopes And Labels.

<P><LI>Click the Insert Address icon (Book icon).

<P><LI>In the "Show Names from the" box, select the address book you want to
   search.

<P><LI>In the "Type Name or Select from List" box, type the first character
   of the name you want to find.
<P>
   Word will begin to search your address book for the names that start
   with the character you typed.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: If you are searching a very large address book, the search may take
an extremely long amount of time to finish (a few seconds to possibly 10
minutes or more). This same problem will occur with any feature in Word
that can use the Address Book function.
