</PRE><h3>Introduction</h3>
 
<P>
The Grammar and Spelling Plug-in Modules on the enclosed MW0551 disk
are for use with Microsoft Word for the Macintosh version 5.0. They
correct problems that were discovered with the Word version 5.0
Grammar and Spelling commands. In addition, the Spelling module
includes several improvements.
<P>
<P><h3>Installing the Grammar and Spelling Plug-in Modules</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>If you are working in Word, save your documents, and then quit
   Word.

<P><LI>Copy the new Grammar and Spelling files from the enclosed MW0551
   disk to the Word Commands folder on your hard disk. The Word
   Commands folder is usually stored in the same folder as Word.

<P><LI>If you are prompted to replace existing files, choose the OK
   button.

<P><LI>Restart Word.
<P>
</OL><h3>Grammar and Spelling Improvements</h3>
 
<P>
The new grammar module corrects problems that sometimes cause Word to
quit unexpectedly when running on the Macintosh Plus, SE, Classic,
Portable, and PowerBook 100 models.
<P>
Changes were made to the Spelling command in three areas:

<OL><P><LI>More feedback is provided on the progress of a spelling check.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -  When you choose the Spelling command, the message "Loading
       Spelling Dictionaries" immediately appears on the screen to
       signal that Word has begun to check spelling.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    -  You can cancel a spelling check at any time by pressing
       COMMAND+PERIOD (.) or by pressing ESC.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    -  In large documents, when Word is searching for the next
       misspelled Word, the percentage of the spelling check that has
       been completed is indicated in the lower-left corner of the
       document window.
</PRE>
<P><LI>The editing of large custom dictionaries is faster.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -  Editing a custom dictionary is much faster, and there is less
       delay when you close the Spelling dialog box after you have
       added words to a custom dictionary.
</PRE>
<P><LI>The handling of "ignored" words has been improved.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -  The Ignore All button now causes Word to ignore words for the
       entire Word session. That is, when you choose the Ignore All
       button, all instances of the selected word are ignored during
       the current spelling check and any other spelling checks you
       conduct until you quit Word.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    -  A new button, Reset "Ignore All" List, has been added to the
       Spelling category of the Preferences command (Tools menu). When
       you choose this button, the Spelling command no longer ignores
       the words you have chosen with the Ignore All button in the
       Spelling dialog box.
