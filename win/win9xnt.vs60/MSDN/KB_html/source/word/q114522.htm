<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for the Macintosh, version 6.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you inadvertent drag one of your program or data file icons onto the 
Word icon, Word opens the file. (Also, after you close the document, you 
may discover that the dragged program or data file is damaged.)
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
By design in Word 6.0 for the Macintosh, you can drag any file or
application onto the Word icon to be opened by Word. This is referred to as
Drag-and-Drop-Launching/Opening. (This functionality excludes folders and
aliases.)
<P>
This functionality can cause a problem if you inadvertently drag a
program onto the Word icon, the program "opens" in a Word document,
and you then save the Word document before you close it. Saving causes Word 
to overwrite the program with a blank text file.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
If you inadvertently drag a program onto the Word icon, close the
resulting document without saving, and the program will remain intact.
If you accidentally save the document, you should reinstall the software,
as there may be irreparable damage to the file.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The conventional method for recognizing and opening a file on the Macintosh
is by way of a file's Creator and File type. However, for Word to open
documents in non-Word formats that do not contain the Creator or File type
(files from the MS-DOS/Windows platform), Word ignores this information and
is, therefore, capable of opening files (applications or data files) of any
type. To convert the file, Word uses its installed converters.
<P>
If you open a program in Word, Word will usually open a blank document
with the title of the program. If you save this newly opened file, Word
will overwrite the program with a blank text file. This file maintains
the resource fork of the original application, but the program is now
not functional.
