The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
On a computer running a "Run from Network Server" installation of Word, if
you run Microsoft Word 97 Setup and click Remove All, you will see the
following message:
<P>
<PRE>   &amp;Run From Network Server is a shared component, and there may be other
   applications using it. If you are sure you want to remove it, click the
   remove button. Otherwise, click the keep button.

   If you want to remove all shared components, click the Remove All
   button. If you do not want to remove any of shared components, click
   the Remove None button.

   [Keep] [Remove] [Remove None] [Remove All]

</PRE>When you click Keep, Word is not removed from your computer. When you run
the Setup program again to try to remove Word, the following error message
is displayed:
<P>
<PRE>   The Setup configuration file 'C:\PROGRA~1\MICROS~4\OFFICE\SETUP
   \Word97.stf' is missing or corrupted. Try running Setup again from
   where you originally ran it.

</PRE>NOTE: This problem occurs when one or more Microsoft Office 97 applications
(for example Microsoft Word 97 for Windows and Microsoft Excel 97 for
Windows) have been set up as individual "Run from Network Server" programs.
This problem does not occur when you have performed the Microsoft Office 97
for Windows "Run from Network Server" setup.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, use the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Re-install Word.

<P><LI>After Word has been re-installed, on the Windows Start menu, point to
   Settings, and then click Control Panel.

<P><LI>Double-click Add/Remove Programs.

<P><LI>On the Install/Uninstall tab, click to select the application you want
   to remove, and then click the Add/Remove button.
<P>
   The Microsoft Word 97 Setup program will start.

<P><LI>In the Microsoft Word 97 Setup dialog box, click Remove All.

<P><LI>When you are prompted with the "Are you sure you want to remove
   Microsoft Word 97?", message, click Yes.

<P><LI>In the Remove Shared Component dialog box, you will see the first
   message "&amp;Run From Network Server" as described in the Symptoms section
   of this article. Click Remove or Remove All.
<P>
   NOTE: If you click Keep or Remove None, Microsoft Word 97 will not be
   removed from your computer and you will receive the second message as
   described in the "Symptoms" section of this article when you try to
   remove Word again.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
