The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you have an AutoExec macro designed to work with an add-in program, Word
will return an error based on the task the AutoExec macro is attempting to
complete. For example, attempting to call a macro stored in an add-in
template results in the following error:
<P>
<PRE>   WordBasic Err=124: Unknown Command, Subroutine, or Function.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
By design, WordBasic is asynchronous in operation. This means that while
one command is processing, dependent upon the command called, your macro
will begin processing the next command.
<P>
For example, if your macro processes a command to print a document, and the
following command line displays a message box, the message box will appear
before the document has completed printing. In Word an AutoExec macro is
run before any add-ins are loaded; therefore, the call to the macro stored
in your add-in fails and an error occurs.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>

language being demonstrated and the tools used to create and debug
procedures. Microsoft support engineers can help explain the functionality

provide added functionality or construct procedures to meet your specific
needs. If you have limited programming experience, you may want to contact

</PRE>The following example macro commands provide a means for working around
this limitation by using the OnTime method to delay processing of a macro
stored in a template add-in.
<P>
The When argument specifies the time at which a macro is to be run. It can
be a string that specifies a time (for example, "4:30 pm" or "16:30"), or
it can be a serial number returned by a function such as TimeValue or
TimeSerial [for example, TimeValue("2:30 pm") or TimeSerial(14, 30, 00)].
You can also include the date [for example, "6/30 4:15 pm" or
TimeValue("6/30 4:15 pm")].
<P>
Use the sum of the return values of the Now function and either the
TimeValue or TimeSerial function to set a timer to run a macro a specified
amount of time after the statement is run. For example, use
Now+TimeValue("00:05:30") to run a macro 5 minutes and 30 seconds after the
statement is run.
<P>
The Tolerance argument specifies the maximum time (in seconds) that can
elapse before a macro that wasn't run at the time specified by When is
canceled. Macros may not always run at the specified time. For example, if
a sort operation is under way or a dialog box is being displayed, the macro
will be delayed until Word has completed the task. If this argument is 0
(zero) or omitted, the macro is run regardless of how much time has elapsed
since the time specified by When.
<P>
NOTE: The time to wait will vary between faster and slower computers and
may need to be adjusted appropriately.
<P>

<PRE>   OnTime Now() + TimeValue("00:00:3"), "MyMacro", 2
