The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, version 6.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run Setup and select the Workstation Installation option to
install Word version 6.0 for Windows on a diskless network workstation,
several error messages may occur:

<OL><P><LI>The following error message may occur after you start Setup:
<P>
   Setup was unable to determine a valid default destination
   directory. You will need to specify a destination directory.

<P><LI>After you select a destination directory and choose the Workstation
</OL>Installation button, the following error message may occur if  SHARE.EXE is
not located in the MS-DOS directory on your floppy disk  drive:
<P>
<PRE>      Setup was unable to find SHARE.EXE on your system. It is
      required to run this application. Please fix your system
      and rerun Setup.

  Note: This may happen even if SHARE loads successfully when you start
  your workstation and is already running.

   If this error message occurs, Setup will stop, and the error
   described in number 3 below does not occur.

   For information about this error message and SHARE.EXE when you run
   Setup on a standalone computer, query on the following words in the
   Microsoft Knowledge Base:

      share.exe and word and 6.0 and cannot and find

</PRE><P><LI>If the error message described in number 2 above does not occur (if
   Setup does not stop), Setup displays the following dialog box after
   you select the Program Manager group for your Word icons:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Not Enough Space on Drive C:
</PRE><P>
   The following options have been selected for installation on drive
   C:\.
<P>
<P><PRE>      Workstation Shared
<PRE></PRE>      Microsoft Word          4K

   Word is attempting to install 4k of information to the C:\ drive even
   when all components are to be installed on the network.

   If you choose the Install Now button, Setup continues, but then the
   following error message occurs:

      Could not open the file named: 'C:\AUTOEXEC.TMP'.

   After you cancel this dialog box, Setup notifies you that it did not
   completely install Word.

</PRE></OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Word version 6.0 for
Windows Setup program. This problem was corrected in Word version 6.0a
Setup.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Errors number 1 and 3 occur because Setup looks for your AUTOEXEC.BAT and
CONFIG.SYS files only on a system (bootable) hard disk (usually the C
drive), which does not exist on a diskless network workstation.
<P>
Error number 2 occurs because Setup cannot find the MS-DOS SHARE command
unless SHARE.EXE is located in the MS-DOS directory on your floppy disk
drive.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
Use one of the two workarounds described below so that Setup searches drive
A instead of searching unsuccessfully for drive C. Do the following for
both workarounds (this avoids error number 2 above):
<P>
Place a copy of SHARE.EXE in an MS-DOS directory on a disk in drive A
before you run Word Setup. You do not have to start SHARE from this
location; it only needs to be there so Word Setup can find it. You can
place SHARE.EXE on a non-system disk if you do not start (boot) your
computer from the floppy disk drive; if you start your computer from the
floppy disk drive, you should place SHARE.EXE in the MS-DOS directory on
your system disk.
<P>
<P><h3>Workaround 1: Use SUBST</h3>
 
<P>
Notes: This workaround is best if you start (boot) your computer from the
floppy disk drive. The MS-DOS SUBST.EXE utility must be available when you
start your workstation.

<OL><P><LI>Place the following MS-DOS SUBST line in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file for
   your workstation:
<P>
<P><PRE>      SUBST C: A:\
</PRE><P>
   You should place this line after the network login commands
   (such as IPX, NETX, and LOGIN) in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

<P><LI>Place a copy of SUBST.EXE on the system floppy disk you use to start
   your workstation.

<P><LI>Restart your computer using the modified system disk.

<P><LI>Start Windows and run Word Setup. The above errors no longer occur,
   and Setup adds the following line to the AUTOEXEC.BAT file on your
   system floppy disk:
<P>
<P><PRE>      @LOADHIGH A:\DOS\SHARE.EXE /L:500 /F:5100
</PRE>
<P><LI>When Setup proposes C:\WINWORD as the destination directory, you
   should change it to your network user directory.

<P><LI>(optional) After you install Word, you can remove SUBST.EXE from your
   floppy disk, and you can remove the SUBST line from your AUTOEXEC.BAT
   file.
<P>
</OL><h3>Workaround 2: Map to the User Directory (Use with Novell)</h3>
 
<P>
Map drive C to a valid network directory, such as the user's directory. As
the network administrator, you may want to choose this method if your users
do not have the SUBST.EXE file. Once you have run Word Setup, you can
remove the mapping. This solution is the optimal to use with a Novell
network.
<P>
Use the following syntax to map DRIVE C: to a valid network
directory
such as the user's directory:
<P>
<PRE>   MAP C:=SERVER/VOLUME:DIRECTORY/SUBDIRECTORY

</PRE></OL>Example:
<P>
<PRE>   MAP C:=PSS/SYS:USERS/ANTOINES

</PRE>When Setup proposes C:\WINWORD as the destination directory, you should
change it to your network user directory.
<P>
When you use this workaround, Setup installs Word correctly. However,
Setup cannot modify the AUTOEXEC.BAT file, so error number 3 in the
Symptoms section above still occurs. You will receive a message stating:
<P>
<PRE>   Could not open...'C:\AUTOEXEC.TMP'

</PRE>Choose Cancel. You will then receive the message:
<P>
<PRE>   Setup was not successful...

</PRE>Choose OK. No group or icon will be created. In addition, you must
manually modify the AUTOEXEC.BAT file after Setup is complete to include
the line:
<P>
<PRE>   LOADHIGH A:\DOS\SHARE.EXE /L:500 /F:5100
</PRE>
