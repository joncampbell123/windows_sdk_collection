The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for the Macintosh, versions 6.0, 6.0.1, 6.0.1a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you create a new document in the Modern style using the Agenda Wizard,
and that document contains a WordArt object, you may receive the following
error:
<P>
<PRE>   Word cannot find the graphics filter, or there is not enough memory to
   load it.

</PRE>Also, after you modify the WordArt object in the Agenda Wizard and click
Apply, you may receive the following error:
<P>
<PRE>   WordArt does not have enough memory to transfer the picture of the text
   you typed.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This error message occurs if you have installed the Word 97-98 Import
Converter, and Word does not have enough memory to load a graphics filter
or run WordArt properly.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, try typing less text.
<P>
To resolve this problem, use the appropriate method for your situation.
<P>
<P><h3>Word Cannot Find the Graphics Filter</h3>
 
<P>
For the first error message
<P>
<PRE>   Word cannot find the graphics filter, or there is not enough memory to
   load it

</PRE>remove the following files from the Word Extensions folder:

<UL><LI>68K JPEG Import
<LI>68K Metafile Import
<LI>68k PNG Import
<P>
</UL>This folder is normally in the following location:
<P>
<PRE>   &lt;hard drive&gt;:Microsoft Office:Microsoft Word 6:

</PRE>NOTE: Removing these files does not affect your ability to import Word 97
or 98 documents into Word. However you will no longer be able to import
pictures in JPEG, Windows Metafile, and PNG formats.
<P>
<P><h3>WordArt Does Not Have Enough Memory to Transfer the Picture of the Text</h3>
 
<P>
For the second error message
<P>
<PRE>   WordArt does not have enough memory to transfer the picture of the text
   you typed. Try typing less text, or close the WordArt application and
   use the finder's GetInfo command to increase the size of WordArt's
   memory partition.

</PRE>increase the Preferred Memory Size for WordArt by following these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Locate the icon for the WordArt program, which is usually in
   the Microsoft folder on the hard disk, and click it.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Get Info.

<P><LI>In the Preferred Size box change the memory size by adding an additional
   1000 K (kilobytes).

<P><LI>Close the window by clicking in the upper left corner.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
