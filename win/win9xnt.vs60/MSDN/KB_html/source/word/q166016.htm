</PRE> 
<P>
<PRE>Combine table borders    6.0 7.0 97   If a table contains two contiguous
like Word for                         cells whose border is formatted
the Macintosh 5.x                     differently, the left-most cell is
                                      displayed with the border width of
                                      the right-most cell.

Do full justification            97   To achieve full justification,
like WordPerfect 6.x                  WordPerfect compresses the spaces
for Windows                           between words while Word expands
                                      them. This often results in different
                                      line breaks and leads to different
                                      page breaks. To implement the
                                      WordPerfect justification method,
                                      select "Do full justification like
                                      WordPerfect 6.x for Windows" in the
                                      Options list.

Don't add automatic tab  6.0 7.0 97   Ignores the automatic tab stop that
stop for hanging indent               Word 6.0 uses when creating a hanging
                                      indent.

Don't add extra space    6.0 7.0 97   Prevents Word from inserting
for raised/lowered                    additional space between lines to
characters                            accommodate raised or lowered
                                      characters.

Don't add leading            7.0 97   Displays text without leading between
(extra space) between                 the lines. This is the same
rows of text                          functionality that exists in Word
                                      versions 5.x for the Macintosh.

Don't add space for          7.0 97   Word doesn't add extra space for
underlines                            underlines.

Don't balance columns    6.0 7.0 97   Prevents Word from balancing
for continuous section                columns at the end of a section or
starts                                document.

Don't balance Sbcs           7.0 97   Not used in U.S. English Word.
</PRE>characters and Dbcs
characters
<P>
<PRE>Don't blank the area     6.0 7.0 97   Prevents Word from obscuring any text
behind metafile                       or graphics surrounding an inserted
pictures                              metafile. Selecting this option
                                      decreases editing speed.

Don't center "exact              97   Changes the vertical position of text
line height" lines                    between the top of the line space and
                                      the bottom of the line space.
                                      With the option off, any extra space
                                      is split between the ascender and
                                      descender. With the option on, all
                                      the extra space goes to the
                                      descender.

ending SHIFT+RETURN                   is formatted as justified.

Expand/condense by           7.0 97   Rounds the measurement of the 
whole number of points                spacing for characters with 
                                      condensed or expanded spacing to

<P>
<PRE>Print body text before       7.0 97   Prints the main text layer before the
header/footer                         Header/Footer layer, which allows for
                                      the process of PostScript codes in
                                      the text layer the same way Word 5.x
                                      for the Macintosh does. (This
                                      functionality is the reverse of the
                                      default order.)

Print colors as black    6.0 7.0 97   Prints all colors as black, instead
on noncolor printers                  of using grayscale (different shades
                                      of gray) when you use a printer that
                                      does not print color.

Set the width of a               97   WordPerfect calculates the width of a
space like WordPerfect                space in a proportional font
5.x                                   differently than Word does. In the
                                      WordPerfect interface, this default
                                      word spacing is named WordPerfect
                                      Optimal. The Word 97 text converters
                                      can use the WordPerfect formula for
                                      spacing.

Show hard page or        6.0 7.0 97   If a frame contains a manual, or hard
column breaks in frames               page break or column break, Word
                                      displays it.

Substitute fonts based       7.0 97   Option used by the WordPerfect 6.x
on font size                          converter to make a font request
                                      based on font size first, and if a
                                      match is not found, to actually map
                                      the font.

Suppress extra line              97   WordPerfect suppresses any extra line
spacing at bottom                     spacing from the last line on a page.
of page                               For example, if line spacing is set
                                      to double, the final line on the page
                                      does not show white space below it.
                                      To implement the line-spacing
                                      feature, select "Suppress extra line
                                      spacing at bottom of page" in the
                                      Options list.

Suppress extra line      6.0 7.0 97   Prevents Word from adding extra line
spacing at top of page                spacing at the top of a page. If the
                                      line spacing for the line at the top
                                      of a page is set for more than single
                                      spacing, Word ignores the extra
                                      spacing so that the top margin will
                                      not increase.

Suppress extra line          7.0 97   Prevents Word from adding extra line
spacing at the top of                 spacing at the top of a page. If the
page like Word 5.x                    line spacing for the line at the top
for the Mac                           of a page is set for more than single
                                      line spacing, Word ignores the extra
                                      spacing so that the top margin will
                                      not increase.

Suppress extra line          7.0 97   This ensures that the layout of
spacing like WP 5.x                   converted WordPerfect documents
                                      formatted with Automatic line height
                                      closely matches that of the original
                                      document.

Suppress space before    6.0 7.0 97   Word suppresses the space in a
after a hard page or                  paragraph formatted with the Space
column break                          Before option that follows a hard
                                      page break or column break.

Swap left and right      6.0 7.0 97   If a paragraph has a left border
borders on odd facing                 (not a box) and the "Different
pages                                 Odd/Even Headers" or "Mirror Margins"
                                      check box is selected, Word prints
                                      the border on the right on odd
                                      numbered pages.

Treat \" as " " in       6.0 7.0 97   In a data source, converts a
mail merge data sources               delimiter composed of a backslash and
                                      quotation mark (\") to two quotation
                                      marks (" "), so that Word can
                                      recognize quotation marks.

Truncate font height         7.0 97   Word rounds the font size up or down
                                      as in WordPerfect 6.x for Windows.

Use larger small caps        7.0 97   Applies small caps formatting in Word
like MacWord 5.x                      version 6.0 for the Macintosh the
                                      same way as Word version 5.x for the
                                      Macintosh, which produces slightly
                                      larger smaller capital letters.

Use printer metrics              97   "Use printer metrics to lay out
to lay out document                   document," has also been added to the
(printer independent                  Options dialog box (Tools menu) under
doc layouts)                          Compatibility. In earlier versions of
                                      Word, there were some problems
                                      associated with repagination of
                                      double-spaced documents and
                                      footnotes. Page breaks might appear
                                      at the wrong location or footnotes
                                      may span several pages. This feature
                                      resolves this. Word now uses its own
                                      picture of the document that in this
                                      situation is printer independent.

Use Word 6.x/95 Border           97   Word suppresses paragraph borders
Rules                                 when paragraph is intersected by
                                      frames or wrapped drawing objects.

Wrap Trailing Spaces     6.0 7.0 97   Automatically moves any spaces that
To Next Line                          trail into the margin after a word at
                                      the end of a line to the beginning of
                                      the next line.
