<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 2.0, 2.0a, 2.0a-CD, 2.0b,
   2.0c, 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows 95, versions 7.0, 7.0a
<LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you spell check a document in Word, Word does not stop at words that
are spelled correctly but that are included in the exclude dictionary.
Instead, it acknowledges them as spelled correctly.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Words contained in an exclude dictionary should be flagged as
misspelled in Word for Windows documents when you run the spelling
checker. The following are reasons why a word in an exclude dictionary
may not be flagged as incorrect:

<UL><LI>The exclude dictionary is in a different directory than the main
   dictionary.

<LI>The exclude dictionary does not have an .exc extension and the same
   file name as the main dictionary. For example, if the main dictionary
   is Sp_am.lex, the exclude dictionary must be Sp_am.exc.

<LI>You edited the exclude dictionary in Word and the changes do not take
   effect until you restart Word.

<LI>You have added a word that consists of only a single character.
<P>
   For additional information, please see the following article in the
   Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../word/q87857.htm">Q87857</A></B>
<PRE></PRE>      TITLE     : WD: Spelling and Grammar Checkers Do Not Flag Single
                  Letters

</PRE></UL><h3>Versions 2.0 and 2.0a Only</h3>
 
<P>
The word is contained in both an exclude and a custom dictionary. After
Word for Windows checks the exclude dictionary, it checks the custom
dictionary. If Word for Windows finds the word in both dictionaries, it
considers the word to be spelled correctly.
<P>
NOTE: This information does not pertain to Word for Windows versions
2.0a-cd, 2.0b, and 2.0c. These versions will exclude a word that is
contained in the exclude dictionary even if the word is found in the custom
dictionary.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
An exclude dictionary contain words that you want the spelling checker to
flag as incorrect even though the words are not normally considered
misspelled.
