The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, version 6.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The following error message may occur after you run the Word 6.0a for
Windows Patch (UPGRADE.EXE) to upgrade your existing Word 6.0 installation:
<P>
<PRE>   The wrong WWINTL.DLL  has been loaded. Make sure that the Word
   directory is in the path.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>U.S. (North American) Version of Word 6.0</h3>
 
<P>
If you ran the Word 6.0a Patch to upgrade a U.S. version of Word 6.0 for
Windows, this error occurs because you received a bad patch disk from
Microsoft. Microsoft sincerely apologizes for the inconvenience we have
caused our valued customers.
<P>
NOTE: This problem does not occur when you run the patch that you
downloaded from an online service. It only happens when you run the patch
from a disk sent to you by Microsoft.
<P>
<P><h3>International Localized Version of Word 6.0</h3>
 
<P>
If you ran the Word 6.0a Patch to upgrade an international localized
version of Word 6.0 for Windows, this error occurs because the patch is not
designed for use with the international localized versions of Word
(including the English/U.K. and English/Australian localized versions). The
international localized versions of Word require a unique patch.
<P>
Please contact the Microsoft subsidiary for your area for information about
obtaining a localized version of the Word 6.0a Patch disk. To locate your
subsidiary, see the Microsoft World Wide Offices Web site at:
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/worldwide/default.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/worldwide/default.htm</A></B>

</PRE><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
If you received a bad Word 6.0a Patch disk, Microsoft is sending you a
replacement disk. You don't need to do anything further to obtain this
corrected patch disk. If you want to download a correct version of the
patch from an online service, see the "How to Download Word 6.0a" section
at the end of this article.
<P>
To get Word 6.0 running again, whether you used the bad patch disk or
upgraded an international localized version of Word, use the following
instructions to uninstall and then reinstall Word:
<P>
NOTE: You will need your Word 6.0 for Windows program disks for this
procedure.
