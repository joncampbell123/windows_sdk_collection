The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows 95, versions 7.0, 7.0a

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
By default, when you fill in an online form, Word positions the
insertion point in the first FORM field and moves from one field
to the next in the form when you press the TAB key. (For Word 6.x, 
pressing ENTER also moves you from one field to the next; this is not
true for Word 7.x). To change the default tabbing order, use
the procedure described in this article.
<P>

</PRE>To change the default tabbing order, assign Exit macros to the
FORM fields. These macros use the EditGoTo WordBasic statement
to tell Word which FORM field to select next.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1: Single Exit Macro for All FORM Fields</h3>
 
<P>
Create a macro similar to sample below and assign it to each FORM
field in your document as an Exit macro. In the Select Case statement,
list each FORM field for which you want to change the tabbing order
along with an EditGoTo statement to tell Word which field to select next.
<P>
<PRE>   Sub MAIN
      Dim dlg As FormFieldOptions
      GetCurValues dlg
      n$ = dlg.Name
      Select Case n$
         Case "To"
            EditGoTo .Destination = "From"
         Case "From"
            EditGoTo .Destination = "Subject"
         Case "Subject"
            EditGoTo .Destination = "Header"
         Case  "Header"
            EditGoTo .Destination = "CC"
         Case "CC"
            EditGoTo .Destination = "Memo"
         Case "Memo"
            EditGoTo .Destination = "To"
         Case Else
      End Select
   End Sub

</PRE><h3>Method 2: Separate Macros for Each FORM Field</h3>
 
<P>
Alternatively, you can assign a separate Exit macro to each FORM
field for which you want to change the tabbing order. Each macro
contains an EditGoTo statement that moves the insertion point to the
desired FORM field.
<P>
Tip: To easily identify each macro, give the macro a name that describes
its functionality. For example, give the name "GoToSubject" to the Exit
macro that moves the insertion point to the Subject FORM field.
<P>
The following sample Exit macro, named "GoToSubject", moves from the
current FORM field to the "Subject" FORM field:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub Main
      EditGoTo "Subject"
   End Sub
