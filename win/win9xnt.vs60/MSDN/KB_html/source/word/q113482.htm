6.00 6.00a
WINDOWS

<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 6.0, 6.0a
<LI>Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Word 6.0 for Windows, if you open a Word 2.x for Windows file that
contains a link to a Microsoft Excel worksheet, you cannot change to a
different source file. In Word, you can choose Links from the Edit menu,
choose the Change Source button, select a new worksheet as a source file,
and then choose OK; Word lists the new worksheet name in the Edit Links
dialog box, and you can choose OK. However, the original Microsoft Excel
worksheet continues to appear in the document and, if you re-open the
Edit Links dialog box, Word again lists the original Microsoft Excel
worksheet as the source file (as if you never choose the Change Source
button and changed the source file).
<P>
This only happens with documents you created in Word 2.x. It does not
happen with a document you originally created in Word 6.0.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Your Windows REG.DAT file does not contain a valid path to Microsoft Excel.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
Method 1: Use the instructions below to update your REG.DAT file so it
<PRE>          points to the correct location of Microsoft Excel. The advantage
          of this method is that it corrects the problem for all Word 2.x
          files that contain a link to a Microsoft Excel worksheet.

          a. Open Windows File Manager.

          b. Select one of the following two files:

             OLE2.REG (located in your &lt;WINDOWS&gt;\SYSTEM subdirectory)
             WINWORD6.REG (located in your Word 6.0 program directory)

          c. From the File menu, choose Associate. REG should appear in the
             Files With Extension box (if it doesn't appear there, type it
             in).

          d. From the Associate With list, select Registration Entries
             (regedit.exe) and then choose OK.

          e. Double-click OLE2.REG. Choose OK when the following message
             appears in a Registration Info Editor dialog box:

                Information in &lt;PATH&gt;\OLE2.REG has been successfully
                registered in the registration database.

          f. Double-click WINWORD6.REG. Choose OK when the Registration
             Info Editor message appears.

</PRE>Method 2: In Word, Use the Links command on the Edit menu to break the link
<PRE>          and then to re-establish it.

          Note: The drawback to this method is that it does not permanently
          resolve the problem. If you want to avoid the problem in the
          future, use Method 1.
