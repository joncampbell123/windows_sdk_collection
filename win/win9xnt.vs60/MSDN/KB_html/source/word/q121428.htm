The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you start Word for Windows version 6.0, the Word logo screen appears
and then the following error message appears(even though SHARE.EXE or
VSHARE.386 are correctly loaded on your computer):
<P>
<PRE>   You must exit and load SHARE.EXE. When you choose OK in the error
   message dialog box, Word closes.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This error message occurs if your local hard disk (for example, drive C) is
write-protected. When you start the program, Word 6.0 tests the local hard
disk to determine whether the system supports file and byte-range locking
(both are required by all OLE applications for OLE functionality) on that
partition. Word 6.0 tests the root directory of the local hard disk instead
of the TEMP directory; Word cannot start if your local hard disk is write-
protected, even if you have a valid TEMP directory on a logical drive on
which you have read-write privileges. For more details about this process,
see the "More Information" section of this article.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Your hard disk (usually drive C) must not be write-protected while Word for
Windows version 6.0 is being started. If you have a Bernoulli cartridge,
you must make it non-removable using its supplied utility. There is no
other workaround.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Word for Windows versions
6.0, 6.0a, and 6.0c. This problem has been corrected in Word version 7.0
for Windows 95. Windows 95 and Windows NT have the required locking built
into the operating system, so OLE applications can be assured that the
required functionality will be available, and they don’t need to test for
it. However, the behavior of Word for Windows version 6.0 does not change
under these operating systems; it functions as it does under Windows
versions 3.10 and 3.11. It must still have write-access to the partition at
startup.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
All OLE 2.0 applications require file- and byte-range-locking
functionality. At start-up, Word tests for this functionality by attempting
to create and then lock a temporary file. Instead of testing the directory
specified in the MS-DOS TEMP statement, Word 6.0 uses the Windows
GetDriveType() API call to check for local non-removable media (such as a
hard disk or another disk such as a locked Bernoulli cartridge).
<P>
If found, Word 6.0 issues an INT21,5Bh call to write the temporary (.TMP)
file to the root directory of the first partition in the series (usually
drive C) and an INT21,5Ch call to attempt to lock the file. If either the
write or the lock attempt fails, Word displays the "...exit and load
SHARE.EXE" message and quits. These routines were removed in Word95 and
WordNT.
