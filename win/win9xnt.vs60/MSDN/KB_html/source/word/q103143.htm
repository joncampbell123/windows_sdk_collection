This article contains the text of "Graphics and Graphics Conversions
Questions and Answers," which is available on the Microsoft FastTips
service for Word for Windows. It answers the most frequently asked
questions regarding graphics and graphics conversions in Word for
Windows.

<PRE>1. Q. Why doesn't my graphic print in Word 2.0 for Windows?

   A. If your graphics do not print, make sure you are using Word version
      2.0a or later. If you are using Word version 2.0, you can obtain a
      free update by phoning Microsoft Customer Serivce at 1-800-426-9400.

      Graphics may not print for several reasons, and the problem may
      depend on the equipment you are using. Scanned high-resolution
      monochrome graphics may not print because of Windows
      limitations. In such cases, use another file format (such as
      Windows Metafile) or use a lower resolution scan. Files greater
      than 64 kilobytes (K) in size may encounter a Windows converter
      limitation. You may be able to print these images by using the
      following four steps:

      1. Select the picture.

      2. From the Edit menu, choose Cut.

      3. From the Edit menu, choose Paste Special.

      4. Under Data Type, select Bitmap, then choose the OK button.

      Images scaled in Word for Windows may not print on some
      printers. Scale the image with the originating application or
      choose Picture from the Format menu in Word for Windows, scale
      the image to 100 percent, and try printing again. Ensure that
      you have the latest available printer driver. To determine the
      printer driver version, use the following five steps:

      1. From the File menu, choose Printer Setup.

      2. Select your printer and choose the Setup button.

      3. Make sure that Draft mode is not selected.

      4. Choose the About button. (A version number should be
         displayed.)

      5. If there is no About button look for a "V number" near the
         OK button.

      Some representative driver versions include the following:
      Hewlett-Packard (HP) LaserJet Series II, version 3.4 or later;
      HP LaserJet Series III, version 3.0.3.85 or later; HP PaintJet
      500 version 2.0; and IBM Personal Pageprinter version 3.4.

2. Q. Why aren't my graphics importing correctly in Word 2.0 for
      Windows?

   A. Graphics may fail to import for a wide variety of reasons,
      including the following:

      1. The required graphic filter may not be installed. The filter
         should be listed in the [MSGraphicImportFilters] section of
         your Windows WIN.INI file. If the filter is not installed,
         run the Word Setup program and select the Custom Installation
         option.

      2. The graphics filter file may be installed, but it does not
         exist in the subdirectory specified in your WIN.INI file. If
         not, install it using the Word Setup program.

      3. Your graphics file may have the wrong filename extension.
         Make sure the extension matches the one listed in the
         [MSGraphicImportFilters] section of WIN.INI. See page 382 of
         the "Microsoft Word User's Guide" for a list of correct
         graphics filename extensions.

      4. You have no printer installed. You cannot import a graphic
         without a printer installed.

      5. You do not have a valid TEMP variable, which is set using the
         SET TEMP statement in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file. This statement
         should point to an existing directory that has a minimum of 2
         megabytes (MB) free disk space.

      6. Your graphic file is damaged. To test this possibility, try
         to import a different graphic of the same format. If that one
         works, there may be a problem with the original graphic file.
         If you do not have another graphic, try importing your
         graphic into the original application or into another
         application.

      For additional information on the graphic formats supported by
      Word 2.0 for Windows, refer to the GRAPHICS.DOC document,
      located in the Word for Windows program directory.

3. Q. How can I draw lines in Word 2.0 for Windows, as I can in
      Microsoft Word for MS-DOS and WordPerfect?

   A. Line drawing is useful for creating organizational charts and
      other special documents. You can add line drawings to your Word
      document using one of the following procedures:

      1. Create lines in Microsoft Draw and then embed these
         structures into your document. To embed a Draw object, use
         the following steps:

         a. Position the insertion point where you want to place the
            object (or line drawing).

         b. From the Insert menu, choose Object.

         c. In the Object Type box, select Microsoft Drawing and
            choose the OK button.

         d. In Microsoft Draw, create a drawing to embed into the Word
            document.

         e. From the Microsoft Draw File menu, choose Exit And Return
            To FILENAME.DOC.

         f. Choose the Yes button to update the document file.

      2. Use the Insert Symbol command to insert line drawing
         characters from the MS LineDraw (TrueType) font, available
         for use with Word. The MS LineDraw (TrueType) font is
         specifically designed to contain the characters used in the
         line-drawing feature in Word for MS-DOS and WordPerfect
         versions 5.0 and 5.1.

         The MS LineDraw (TrueType) font is available in the Microsoft
         Product Support Services application note titled "MS LineDraw
         (TrueType) Font" (GC0651) for Word for Windows. To obtain
         this application note, call Microsoft Product Support
         Services at (425) 462-9673. This application note is also
         available on the Microsoft Download Service(MSDL).
