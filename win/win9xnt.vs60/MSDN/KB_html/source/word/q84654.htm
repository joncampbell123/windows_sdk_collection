<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If you run Microsoft Word for Windows in the Microsoft Windows operating
system version 3.1 with the Diamond Stealth video driver that ships with
Windows versions 3.0 and 3.1, your computer may hang when you save a
document in Word for Windows. To correct this problem, you must upgrade the
video driver.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, use the Windows version 3.1 standard VGA video
driver until you receive the updated Diamond Stealth video driver.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Windows version 3.0 drivers for the Diamond Stealth VRAM display adapters
may also cause problems if used with Windows version 3.1. The video driver
for this third-party display adapter must be updated to display TrueType
fonts correctly. Updated video drivers can be obtained from Diamond
Computer Systems or from Microsoft by purchasing the Microsoft Windows
Driver Library (WDL) version 3.1.
<P>
From the Windows Driver Library (WDL) S3.EXE dated 4-02-92, contains the
updated drivers. (The 32K color driver is not yet available.)
<P>
You can download the WDL from CompuServe, GEnie, or the Microsoft Download
Service at (425) 936-6735 (MSDL).
