<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Word 6.0 for Windows implements Bullets And Numbering as paragraph
formatting. This is different than the symbol character implementation in
earlier versions of Word. Since Bullets And Numbering are considered
paragraph formatting, they will not be translated in documents converted
using the Text Only converter. The following table outlines the affect of
different conversions on Bullets And Numbering for Word 2.x and 6.0.
<P>
For additional information on conversions, see CONVINFO.DOC, which ships
with Word 2.x or README.DOC, which ships with Word 6.0 for Windows.

2.x      Text Only              Numeric text characters are used for
         DOS Text Only          numbering. Bullet characters are replaced
                                by Insert Symbol field code information
                                regardless of whether field codes are
                                displayed before conversion. Formatting
                                is applied to both numbered and bulleted
                                list items using tabs and spaces for
                                indentation.

6.0      Text Only              No conversion of bullets or numbering.
         DOS Text Only          All formatting applied with insertion
                                of bullets or numbering is removed.
                                Attempting to save a file in Text Only
                                or DOS Text Only will give the warning
                                message:

                                   This document contains formatting
                                   that cannot be saved in text format.
                                   Do you want to save changes to
                                   &lt;&lt;filename&gt;&gt;?

                                Choosing OK to save the document in
                                one of these two formats will yield
                                the results above.

2.x      Text w/Line Breaks     Numeric text characters are used for
         DOS Text w/Line Brks   numbering. Bullet characters are retained
         DOS Word               without field codes although some mapping
         RTF-DCA                may occur depending on the symbol and font
                                originally chosen. Formatting is applied to
                                both numbered and bulleted list items using
                                tabs and spaces for indentation.

                                numbers without separating spaces or tabs.
                                Bullet characters are omitted but
                                indentation formatting associated with

                                defined. Formatting is applied to both
