The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for the Macintosh, version 6.0
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows 95, versions 7.0, 7.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you open a document that was created or edited in Word 5.1 for the
Macintosh, when you attempt to print the document, the printout may be a
blank document, or the document may not be printed at all.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem is caused by an invalid page number value that, when converted
to Word, causes the document not to print.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To correct this problem in Word 6.0 for the Macintosh, update to Word
version 6.0.1 for the Macintosh. If you cannot upgrade to Word 6.0.1 for
the Macintosh or if you are running Word 7.0 for Windows 95, use either of
the following methods to reset the document's starting page number.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1: Use a Macro to Reset the Page Number</h3>
 
<P>
If multiple documents are affected, you may want to use the following macro
to reset the starting page number automatically.
<P>
WARNING: ANY USE BY YOU OF THE CODE PROVIDED IN THIS ARTICLE IS AT YOUR OWN
RISK. Microsoft provides this macro code "as is" without warranty of any
kind, either express or implied, including but not limited to the implied
warranties of merchantability and/or fitness for a particular purpose.
<P>
<PRE>   Sub MAIN
      FormatPageNumber
   End Sub

</PRE>To automatically run this macro each time you open a file, create an
AutoOpen macro that includes the above code. AutoOpen macros are executed
each time you open a file.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 2: Manually Reset the Page Number</h3>
 
<P>
To manually reset the page number, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Open a document.

<P><LI>On the Insert Menu, click Page Numbers.

<P><LI>Click the Format button.

<P><LI>In the Page Numbering box, click OK.
<P>
  When you click OK, the page numbers are inserted.

<P><LI>Click Close.
<P>
</OL>When you click Close, the formatting is updated.
<P>
After you use either of these methods, you should be able to print the
document. However, if you are still unable to print the document correctly,
you may be able to fix the document with one of the following methods.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 3: Save the File in Rich Text Format (RTF)</h3>
 
<P>
To do this, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the File menu, click Save As.

<P><LI>On the Save File As Type list, select Rich Text Format, and click the
  Save button.

<P><LI>Close the document and re-open it.
<P>
</OL>Method 4:
<P>
Select everything except the last paragraph mark by pressing COMMAND+END,
and then press COMMAND+SHIFT+HOME. Copy everything except the last
paragraph mark to a new document.
<P>
Word for the Macintosh associates a wide variety of formatting with the
last paragraph mark, especially section and style formatting. If you copy
everything except the last paragraph mark to a new document, the corrupt
page number may be left in the original document. In the new document,
reapply the section or style formatting if necessary.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Word version 6.0 for the
Macintosh and Word 7.0 for Windows 95. This problem was corrected in Word
version 6.0.1 for the Macintosh. Microsoft is researching this problem for
Word 7.0 for Windows 95 and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
