<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article answers the most frequently asked questions about Web page
authoring in Word 97.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 

<PRE>1. Q. Can I configure the FrontPage Explorer to use Word as its Web
      page editor?

   A. Yes. For additional information about how to do this, please see the
      following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../frontpg/q143095.htm">Q143095</A></B>
      TITLE     : Configuring FrontPage to Use an HTML Editor Other Than
                  Explorer

2. Q. Can I publish the Web pages that I create in Word to an intranet or
      Internet server?

   A. Yes. You can use the Microsoft Web Publishing Wizard to publish Web
      pages either to an intranet or to an internet server. The Web
      Publishing Wizard is stored in the Webpost.exe file located in the
      ValuPack\WebPost folder on the Microsoft Office 97 or Microsoft Word
      97 CD-ROM. The Webpost.exe file is a self-extracting, self-
      executing program. To install the Web Publishing Wizard, use the
      following steps:

      a) On the Windows taskbar, click Start.

      b) Click Run.

      c) In the Open box, click Browse, select the ValuPack\WebPost folder
         on the CD-ROM drive, select the Webpost.exe file, and then click
         Open.

      d) Click OK.

      For more information about the Web Publishing Wizard, go to the
      Microsoft Web site:

         <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/software/webpost/wp2.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/software/Webpost/wp2.htm</A></B>

      If you are not using the Web Publishing Wizard, contact your
      Internet service provider, Web master, or network administrator for
      information about how to publish your Web content.

3. Q. Can I use third-party ActiveX controls or controls that I download
      from the Microsoft Web site when I create Web pages in Word?

   A. Word adheres to an earlier version of the ActiveX Control standard
      and requires services that some ActiveX controls for the Web do not
      support. Although you may be able to insert these controls in your
      documents, they are not guaranteed to work reliably. You can reliably
      use controls built using Visual Basic 5.0 or the Visual Basic Control
      Creation Edition and controls designed for Visual Basic 4.0.

      For additional information, please see the following article in the
      Microsoft Knowledge Base:

      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../vbapps/q155903.htm">Q155903</A></B>

4. Q. When I create a page in Word that uses tables, the page looks
      different in a Web browser than it does in Word. When can I expect
      there to be differences and how can I fix them?

   A. In general, tables you create in Word look the same in Word as they
      do in a Web browser if that browser supports tables. (Microsoft
      Internet Explorer 2.0 and later or Netscape 2.0 and later support
      tables.) The following table layouts are displayed differently in
      Word than they are in a Web browser:

      - Tables that contain cells of unequal width appear to have equal
        width cells in Word. For additional information, please see the
        following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

           ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../word/q159549.htm">Q159549</A></B>
           TITLE     : Different-Width Cells Display as Equal-Width Cells
                       in Browser

      - Tables are not automatically adjusted to fit within the document
        window. For additional information, please see the following
        article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

           ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../word/q159866.htm">Q159866</A></B>
           TITLE     : How to Set Table Width to Percentage of Browser
                       Window

      - Pictures contained within table cells whose dimensions are not
        specified may appear truncated on the right. This problem occurs
        because Word resizes the cell to a default width. To display the
        entire picture, resize the table column.

      - Horizontal lines do not appear in Word when placed inside a table.

5. Q. Does Word 97 support nested tables?

   A. No. For additional information, please see the following article in
      the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

         ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../word/q157774.htm">Q157774</A></B>
