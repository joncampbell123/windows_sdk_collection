<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) is Microsoft's strategic interface for
accessing data in a heterogeneous environment of relational and non-
relational database management systems. Based on the Call Level Interface
specification of the SQL Access Group, ODBC provides an open, vendor-
neutral way of accessing data stored in a variety of proprietary personal
computer, minicomputer, and mainframe databases.
<P>
ODBC alleviates the need for independent software vendors and corporate
developers to learn multiple application programming interfaces. ODBC now
provides a universal data access interface. With ODBC, application
developers can allow an application to concurrently access, view, and
modify data from multiple, diverse databases.
<P>
ODBC is a core component of Microsoft Windows Open Services Architecture.
Apple has endorsed ODBC as a key enabling technology by announcing support
into System 7 in the future. With growing industry support, ODBC is quickly
emerging as an important industry standard for data access for both Windows
and Macintosh applications.
<P>
MORE INFORMATION
 
<P>
ODBC is a specification to which developers write either:

<UL><LI>An ODBC-enabled "front-end" or "client" desktop application, also known
   as an "ODBC Client." This is the application that the computer-user
   sees on the computer screen.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>An ODBC Driver for a "back-end" or "server" DBMS (Database Management
   System). This is the DBMS application that resides on a computer that is
   used to store data for access by several users. This application is not
   what is loaded on the end user's computer. This server application is
   usually more robust (faster, with centralized security, and backups of
   data, and so forth) than the client application. The ODBC Driver resides
   between the ODBC Client and the DBMS; however, it is loaded on the
   front-end computer.
<P>
</UL>To use ODBC, the following three components are required:
<P>
ODBC CLIENT - an ODBC-enabled front-end (also called ODBC client) -
Examples: Microsoft Access, an application created with Access, an
application created with Microsoft Visual Basic, an application created
with C+Win SDK+ODBC SDK, or ODBC-enabled applications from other
vendors (such as Lotus).
<P>
ODBC DRIVER - an ODBC Driver for the ODBC Server. The ODBC Driver Catalog
contains an extensive listing of ODBC Drivers. For example, the Microsoft
ODBC Driver Pack is a collection of seven ODBC Drivers ready to be used or
bundled with ODBC clients. A SQL Server ODBC Driver is included with
Access, and Informix is working on an ODBC driver for Informix. To obtain
an ODBC Driver Catalog, call the Microsoft Order Desk at (800) 360-7561. If
you are outside the United States, contact your local subsidiary. To locate
your subsidiary, see the Microsoft World Wide Offices Web site at:
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/worldwide/default.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/worldwide/default.htm</A></B>

</PRE>Any ODBC client can access any DBMS for which there is an ODBC Driver.
<P>
DBMS SERVER is a back-end or server DBMS, for example SQL Server, Oracle,
AS/400, Foxpro, Microsoft Access, or any DBMS for which an ODBC driver
exists.
<P>
<P><h3>How do these three components interact?</h3>
 
<P>
The ODBC client uses a language or vocabulary of commands (which is
referred to as "ODBC") to request data from, or to send data to, the back-
end or server DBMS. However, the DBMS doesn't understand the ODBC client
request until the command passes through the ODBC Driver for that specific
DBMS. This ODBC driver is software that resides on the front-end. The ODBC
driver translates the command into a format that the ODBC Server can
understand. The ODBC Server sends the answer back to the ODBC Driver, which
translates the answer into a format that the ODBC Client can understand.
<P>
<P><h3>What's so great about ODBC?</h3>
 
<P>
First, application developers don't need to modify their applications to
allow them to access data from several back-ends. As long as there is an
ODBC Driver for a particular back-end, an ODBC-enabled front-end can access
it. Second, one ODBC Driver for a particular DBMS allows any ODBC-enabled
application to be an ODBC client.
<P>
<P><h3>Examples of ODBC in Use</h3>
 

<UL><LI>Access front-end accessing data from a Oracle back-end using the Oracle
   ODBC Driver, which ships with Access 1.1.

<LI>Visual Basic front-end accessing data from a dBASE back-end using the
   dBASE ODBC Driver, which is part of the MS ODBC Database Drivers Pack.

<LI>C application written using C+ODBC SDK+Win SDK accessing data from an
   AS/400 using the AS/400 ODBC Driver available from Rochester Software.
<P>
</UL><h3>Basic Questions and Answers</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>What is the ODBC SDK?
<P>
   The ODBC SDK is distributed on floppy disks, and contains about 150
   pages of text that allows a developer to write an ODBC-enabled Client or
   an ODBC Driver. The ODBC SDK is to be used in conjunction with the
   Windows Software Developers Kit (SDK) and a C Compiler.

<P><LI>What is the ODBC Database Driver Pack?
<P>
   The ODBC Database Driver Pack is a collection of ODBC Drivers that
   is sold by Microsoft.

<P><LI>What is the ODBC Driver Catalog?
<P>
   The ODBC Driver Catalog contains descriptions of ODBC drivers developed
   by Microsoft and other software companies. It contains an explanation of
   ODBC, and demonstrates industry support for the standard.

<P><LI>What ODBC drivers are currently available?
<P>
   Dozens of ODBC drivers are currently available, including those for
   Microsoft SQL Server, XLS, Text, xBase, Paradox, ODS, Oracle, RedISAM,
   FoxBase, Btrieve, Integra-SQL, DEC Rdb, SQLBase, Informix, Ingres, DB2,
   SQL/DS, Teradata, and SQL/400.

<P><LI>How do I write an ODBC driver?
<P>
   To write an ODBC driver, use C+Win SDK+ODBC SDK.

<P><LI>What ODBC clients are currently available?
<P>
   From Microsoft: Access, Visual Basic, Foxpro+Connectivity Kit, Word 6.0
   for Windows, Excel 5.0, MS Query Tool.
<P>
   From other vendors: PowerSoft, ObjectView, Lotus 1-2-3, Lotus Approach,
   Lotus Notes, Q+E, and others.

<P><LI>How does one write an ODBC client?
<P>
   By using C+Win SDK+ODBC SDK, or by using Access, or by using Visual
   Basic, or by using WinFox +Connectivity Kit, or by using one of the
   tools from other vendors designed to do this.
