The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 2.0, 2.0a, 2.0a-cd, 2.0b, 2.0c
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows 95, versions 7.0, 7.0a
<LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you start Word for Windows, the Word title screen may appear and then
disappear, and the Word program window may not appear on the screen.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior may occur when you change the video resolution or the video
driver. By doing these things, you may cause the Word program window to be
placed in a location that is not visible on the screen.
<P>
NOTE: Although you cannot see the window, Word is running.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this behavior, use one of the following methods.
<P>
<P><h3>Windows 3.1, 3.11, or Windows for Workgroups 3.11</h3>
 
<P>
Method 1:  a. Start the Windows task list by pressing CTRL+ESC.
<P>
<PRE>              Word should appear in the task list. If Word does not
              appear in the list, start Word and press CTRL+ESC to view the
              task list again.

           b. Click Cascade or Tile.

              Clicking Cascade or Tile forces all opened windows to appear
              on the screen.

           c. Resize the windows as desired.

           d. Exit and restart Word.

              Word should now appear on the screen.

</PRE>Method 2:  a. Start the Windows task list by pressing CTRL+ESC.
<P>
<PRE>              Word should appear in the task list. If Word does not
              appear in the list, start Word and press CTRL+ESC to view the
              task list again.

           b. On the Task List, click Word and click Switch To.

           c. Press ALT+SPACEBAR.

              By pressing these keys, you open the Control Box for the Word
              program window.

           d. Click Move.

           e. Using the arrow keys on the keyboard, move the Word program
              window back to a position on the screen where it is visible.

              You may have to hold an arrow key for several seconds before
              the Word program window appears on the desktop. If you find
              that pressing one arrow key doesn't move the window back on
              the screen, press the opposite arrow key. Note that you may
              need to press the other key for twice the length of time
              during which you pressed the first key. For example, press
              the RIGHT ARROW key for 5 seconds. If the Word program window
              fails to appear, press the LEFT ARROW key for 10  seconds.
              Repeat pressing the UP ARROW and DOWN ARROW keys as needed.

           e. Quit and restart Word.

              Word should now appear on the screen.

</PRE>NOTE: Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 7.0 and 7.0a, do not run on
Windows 3.1, 3.11, and Windows for Workgroups 3.1, 3.11.
<P>
<P><h3>Windows 95</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Determine whether Word appears on the Windows taskbar. If Word does not
   appear on the taskbar, start Word.
<P>
   Note: The Windows taskbar is the bar that has the Start button on it.

<P><LI>Right-click Word on the Windows taskbar.

<P><LI>On the shortcut menu that appears, click Restore.
<P>
   The Word program window should appear.

<P><LI>Exit and restart Word.
