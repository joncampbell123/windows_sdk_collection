This Application Note contains six frequently asked questions about setting 
up and optimizing Microsoft Word version 6.0 for the Macintosh, followed by 
the more in-depth "Optimizing the Performance of Word 6.0 for the 
Macintosh" section.

<OL><P><LI> Q. What is the minimum Macintosh hardware and system configuration
<P><PRE>       I need to run Word 6.0?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. To run Word 6.0, you need a Macintosh with a 68020 or higher
       processor and at least 4 megabytes (MB) of RAM. Word 6.0 also
       requires System 7.0 or later. To run Word 6.0 on a Power
       Macintosh, you need System 7.1 or later and at least 8 MB of
       RAM.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       The program disks provided in the Word package require a 1.4-MB
       floppy disk drive. The requirements for available hard disk
       space and system memory vary, depending on how you choose to
       install Word and how many applications you want to run
       simultaneously. The following table provides the minimum
       requirements for installing and running Word on a Macintosh and
       a Power Macintosh.
</PRE><P>
<PRE>          Minimum             68020 or higher

       Word 6.0: the 128K and 512K Macintosh, Macintosh Plus,
       Macintosh SE, Macintosh Portable, Macintosh Classic, and
       Apple(R) PowerBook(TM) 100.

</PRE><P><LI> Q. How can I make Word 6.0 run faster on my Macintosh?
<P>
   A. Word 6.0 is the most powerful word processing software ever
<P><PRE>      developed for the Macintosh platform. To get the best possible
      performance from Word, you may need to optimize your Macintosh
      system. This Application Note contains instructions you can use to
      optimize your Macintosh. To optimize your Macintosh, you may need to
      make adjustments to your system software (extensions and fonts) or
      hardware configuration (processor type, speed, amount of memory, and
      available hard disk space).
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      For detailed instructions about optimizing Word on your Macintosh
      system, refer to the "Optimizing the Performance of Word 6.0 for the
      Macintosh" section, beginning on page 3 of this Application Note.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. How do I install Word 6.0 on my network?
<P>
<P><PRE>    A. Setting up Word on network workstations is a two-step process:
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       First, you perform a network administrator's installation to
       install Word on a network file server or shared directory or
       folder. Then, each user runs Word Setup from the
       administrator's installation (rather than floppy disks) to
       install Word on a local workstation. You can share a single
       copy of Word with other users on your network, or you can
       install a private copy of Word on your workstation. To perform
       an administrator's installation of Word, use the procedures in
       Chapter 1, "Installing and Starting Word," in "Microsoft Word
       Quick Results". For more information about performing an
       administrator's installation on a network file server or in a
       shared directory or folder, see Appendix B, "Installing and
       Using Word on a Network," in the "Microsoft Word User's Guide."
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       NOTE: Every Word user must have a Microsoft Word license. A
       license is obtained by buying a retail package or a Microsoft
       License Pak. For more information about network use
       restrictions, see your Microsoft Word license agreement.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. What components does Setup install on my computer?
<P>
<P><PRE>    A. In addition to the Word 6.0 program, Setup installs online
       Help, proofing tools (including hyphenation, spelling checker,
       grammar checker, and thesaurus tools), templates, wizards,
       sample documents, and the following shared OLE applications:
       Equation Editor, Microsoft Movie, WordArt, Microsoft Graph, and
       Voice Annotation. For a complete list of the files that Word
       Setup installs for each installation option, see Word's online
       ReadMe Help file.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. How do I install Word 6.0 over Word 4.0 or 5.0?
<P>
<P><PRE>    A. If you have enough hard disk space, you can install Word 6.0 in
       a new location. If you later delete your previous version of
       Word, be careful not to delete your existing documents, custom
       dictionaries, or glossary files. If you install Word 6.0 in a
       different directory or folder and keep the previous version of
       Word as well, Setup does not change the existing Word files or
       modify system information related to the previous version of
       Word.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       If you install Word 6.0 in the same location as your previous
       version of Word, Setup upgrades (replaces) the previous version
       of Word. Setup keeps all your existing documents, glossary
       files, custom dictionaries, and address lists so that you can
       use them in Word 6.0.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       For more information about upgrading from an earlier version of
       Word for the Macintosh, choose Microsoft Word Help from the
       Help menu, click Reference Information, and then click What's
       New In Word 6.0.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. What is the difference between the Complete, Typical, and
<P><PRE>       Minimum installations of Word 6.0?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. For a Typical installation, you need 13 MB of available hard
       disk space (15 MB on a Power Macintosh). For a Typical
       installation, Setup installs the most common Word components,
       including the spelling and grammar checkers, the thesaurus,
       online Help, WordArt, and Microsoft Graph.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       For a Complete installation, which installs the entire Word
       application, you need 25 MB of available hard disk space (27 MB
       on a Power Macintosh). If you perform a Custom installation,
       Setup installs only those Word features that you select.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       For a Minimum installation, you need 5 MB of available hard
       disk space (8 MB on a Power Macintosh). A Minimum installation
       includes only the Word program, spelling checker, and the Word
       ReadMe Help file. Select this installation option if you don't
       have much available hard disk space or are installing Word on a
       laptop.

<P>
<P><PRE>       OPTIMIZING THE PERFORMANCE OF WORD 6.0 FOR THE MACINTOSH
       ========================================================
</PRE><P>
</OL><h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
 
<P>
Word 6.0 is larger and more robust than earlier versions of the
application, so your computer requires more resources to run it. As a
result, the performance of your Macintosh, and therefore Word 6.0, may
be slower. This Application Note describes how you can increase the
operating speed of Word 6.0 for Macintosh when it is running under
Apple System 7.x.
<P>
When you optimize the performance of your Macintosh system, you also
speed up the performance of Word. Optimizing the system involves both
your software (for example, the operating system version, extensions,
fonts, and device drivers) and hardware (for example, processor type
and speed, amount of memory, and available hard disk space). You can
use this Application Note as a checklist to optimize both your
software and hardware configurations for Word and other Macintosh-
based applications running under System 7.x.
<P>
<P><h2>HOW TO OPTIMIZE WORD ON A MACINTOSH WITH 4 TO 6 MB OF RAM</h2>
 
<P>
To run Word 6.0, you must have at least 4 MB of RAM. As with most
minimum requirements, 4 MB is not the optimal amount of memory to run
Word. To run Word 6.0 optimally, we suggest that you either add more
RAM to your computer, or optimize your existing RAM. Even with a 4-MB
environment, you can almost always improve Word's performance by
configuring your Macintosh system to free up additional memory.
<P>
<P><h3>Add More Memory</h3>
 
<P>
If you regularly work with large documents (50 pages or more) or use
many graphics in your documents, adding RAM gives you the most
dramatic improvement in Word's operating speed. If your computer has 8
MB of RAM, Word runs faster, and you can also run another large
application (such as Microsoft Excel) at the same time and interact
with it from Word. On the other hand, if you work primarily with
average-sized documents (50 or fewer pages) and don't use many
graphics, the suggestions that follow should help increase Word's
speed on your 4- to 6-MB computer.
<P>
<P><h3>How to Make 4 MB Seem Like More RAM</h3>
 
<P>
The key to making Word run faster on a computer with 4 MB of RAM is to
free up memory currently used by other operations that have little or
no effect on Word's performance. Use the following recommendations to
make sure the maximum amount of RAM is available for Word to use. The
first recommendations optimize the Macintosh system; the last
recommendation specifically optimizes Word.
<P>
<PRE>   Increasing Available Memory in System 7.x
   =========================================

   This section discusses how you can optimize the Macintosh by
   configuring the Macintosh system.

   Disk Cache/RAM Cache
   --------------------

   On a 4-MB computer, it is important to free up as much memory as
   possible. Although the disk and RAM cache features are designed to
   increase performance, they reserve memory for their purpose--reducing
   the amount of overall available memory. Therefore, minimize the Disk
   Cache setting to 32 kilobytes (K), the smallest setting possible, and
   set the RAM Cache setting to Off. Both of these options are located
   in the Memory control panel.

   Reduce Background Programs--Extensions, Control Panels, and Drivers
   -------------------------------------------------------------------

   Background tasks are allocated valuable memory on your 4-MB Macintosh.
   Limiting the number of background applications that load when you
   start the Macintosh may noticeably increase your Macintosh's available
   memory. Extensions, control panels, and drivers are examples of
   background applications that are loaded into memory at startup.

   For information about background programs, refer to the "Background
   Processing - Extensions, Control Panels, and Drivers" section of this
   Application Note.

   Modify Word's Advanced Settings
   ===============================

   To increase bitmap-redrawing speed and scrolling speed in Word, you
   can use the instructions below to add BitMapMemory and CacheSize
   settings to the "Microsoft Word" category of Word's Advanced Settings.
   To have access to these settings, add the Advanced Settings command to
   the Tools menu with the following steps:

   1. From the Tools menu, choose Customize. Click the Menu tab.

   2. Under Categories, select Tools. Under Commands, select
      ToolsAdvancedSettings.

   3. Click the Add button. Click the Close button.

   BitMapMemory
   ------------

   If your documents often contain many graphics, you should skip this
   section--it could actually make Word run more slowly. Otherwise, by
   modifying the BitMapMemory setting, you can free up some of the memory
   (up to 512K) Word reserves to work with bitmapped graphics. The
   default BitMapMemory size is 1024K (1 MB).

   NOTE: This setting has no effect on the speed of accessing or
   displaying vector graphics such as PICT, EPS, and Windows(TM) metafile
   graphics that do not contain bitmaps as part of their format.

   To add the BitMapMemory setting to Word's Advanced Settings:

   1. From the Tools menu, choose Advanced Settings. If Advanced Settings
      is not available on the Tools menu, see the "Modify Word's Advanced
      Settings" section above.

   2. In the Categories box, choose Microsoft Word.

   3. In the Option box, type BitMapMemory.

   4. In the Setting box, type 512. Click Set and then OK.

   If Word does not seem to run faster, or if Word runs more slowly,
   remove the BitMapMemory setting:

   1. From the Tools menu, choose Advanced Settings. If Advanced settings
      is not available on the Tools menu, see the "Modify Word's Advanced
      Settings" section above.

   2. In the Categories box, choose Microsoft Word.

   3. In the Options box, click the BitMapMemory setting once, and then
      click the Delete button. Click OK.

   CacheSize
   ---------

   The CacheSize setting defines the size of the internal DocumentText
   cache in Word. The default CacheSize setting is 64K, which is also the
   minimum. If you frequently work with large documents, you can increase
   the CacheSize setting to reduce the frequency with which Word accesses
   your hard disk to retrieve parts of your document--thereby improving
   Word's performance. Because of memory constraints on a 4-MB computer,
   the maximum CacheSize setting you should use is 128K.

   To add the CacheSize setting to Word's Advanced Settings:

   1. Repeat steps 1 and 2 in the "BitMapMemory" section of this
      Application Note to access Word's Advanced Settings.

   2. For Option, type CacheSize.

   3. For Setting, type 128. Click Set and then OK.

</PRE></OL><h2>HOW TO OPTIMIZE WORD ON A MACINTOSH WITH AT LEAST 6 MB OF RAM</h2>
 
<P>
On a computer with at least 6 MB of RAM, Word 6.0 for the Macintosh
runs well, even if you make no changes to your Word or Macintosh
System configurations. If you have 6 MB or more of RAM, Word can make
more use of memory and does not need to access the hard disk as
frequently. Even so, you may still be able to improve Word's
performance by making the following additional adjustments to your
system.
<P>
<P><h3>Allocate Memory to Word</h3>
 
<P>
When Word is installed, the installer program allocates a certain
amount of memory to the Word application, based on the amount of
memory on the Macintosh. The following table shows how much memory is
allocated to Word when it is installed, based on the total memory on
your Macintosh:
<P>
<PRE>   Memory on the Macintosh     Setup will allocate
</PRE> 
<PRE>   0-5999K                     2000K
   6000-7000K                  2500K
   7000K and greater           3000K

</PRE>2000K-2500K is sufficient for simple tasks and smaller documents.
However, if you are working on larger documents (50 pages or more) or
documents with many graphics, or if you are performing more memory-
intensive tasks (such as grammar checking), allocate more memory to
Word if it is available.
<P>
For example, if you have 5 MB of memory, Word is allocated 2.5 MB when
it is installed. If the system uses 1.5 MB for itself, that leaves 3.5
MB available when no applications are running. You can safely allocate
another .5 MB of memory to Word, bringing the total to 3 MB.
<P>
To allocate more memory to Word, select the Microsoft Word icon in the
Finder. From the File menu, choose Get Info. Increase the Preferred
Size, based on how much available memory your Macintosh has.
Allocating more memory to Word helps, but generally, unless your
documents contain large numbers of graphics (in which case allocating
up to 6 MB of memory may improve performance), allocating more than 3-
4 MB of memory to Word does not necessarily increase the speed of
Word.
<P>
<P><h3>Disk Cache</h3>
 
<P>
You can increase the disk cache setting in your Macintosh if you have
enough available memory. A larger disk cache can improve the
performance of your Macintosh by setting up a portion of memory to
store frequently used information that is usually accessed from a hard
disk. The disk cache speeds up Macintosh operations such as opening
and quitting Word, loading portions of Word (for example, the grammar
checker), and switching between active programs. The disk cache option
is located in the Macintosh Memory control panel.
<P>
<P><h2>ADVANCED SETTINGS</h2>
 
<P>
You can increase the BitMapMemory or CacheSize settings in Word's
Advanced Settings if you have at least 8 MB of RAM. To modify these
settings, use the procedures in the "Modify Word's Advanced Settings"
section of this Application Note. That section also contains a
description of the BitMapMemory and CacheSize settings.
<P>
<P><h3>BitMapMemory</h3>
 
<P>
If your documents frequently contain many bitmapped graphics (such as
scanned images and screen captures), you can increase the redrawing
and scrolling speed of bitmaps by increasing the amount of memory that
Word reserves for these operations. On a computer with at least 8 MB
of RAM, you can increase the BitMapMemory setting as high as 2048K (2
MB). The following sample entry from Advanced Settings sets the
BitMapMemory value at 2048K:
<P>
<PRE>   [Microsoft Word]
   bitmapmemory=2048

</PRE><h3>CacheSize</h3>
 
<P>
If you primarily work with large documents, you can increase the
CacheSize setting to enlarge Word's internal Document Text cache. With
a larger cache, Word does not need to access the hard disk as
frequently, which speeds up performance. Start by changing the
CacheSize setting to 256K and then, if necessary, increase it to 1024K
(1 MB). The following sample entries from Advanced Settings set these
values respectively:
<P>
<PRE>   [Microsoft Word]
   cachesize=256

   [Microsoft Word]
   cachesize=1024

</PRE>NOTE: You may not need both the BitMapMemory and CacheSize settings,
depending on the type of documents you usually create. If you change
one of these settings and do not notice any improvement in Word's
performance, delete the setting so that Word, System 7.x, and other
applications can use the memory for other operations. You may find
that Word's default settings already provide optimal performance.
<P>
<P><h3>16 MB of RAM or More: Create a RAM Disk</h3>
 
<P>
If you have at least 16 MB of RAM, you can create a RAM disk, which
can provide an increase in Macintosh performance by reserving memory
to emulate a disk. Because memory access is much faster than hard disk
access, running Word from a RAM disk may result in a performance
increase.
<P>
The System 7.x RAM Disk feature is available in the Memory control
panel. To run Word from a RAM disk, you must allocate enough memory
for Word (at least 4 MB).
<P>
<P><h2>ADDITIONAL TIPS FOR IMPROVING WORD FOR THE MACINTOSH PERFORMANCE</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>General Speed Tips</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   Background Processing - Extensions, Control Panels, and Drivers
   ===============================================================

   Besides consuming memory on a Macintosh, background tasks force your
   Macintosh to distribute its processing time instead of concentrating
   it on your foreground application. Even if they are completely idle,
   background applications are allocated processor time that could be
   devoted to simple tasks such as updating windows. Extensions, control
   panels, and drivers are examples of background applications that are
   loaded into memory at startup. Limiting the number of background
   applications that load when you start the Macintosh may noticeably
   increase performance. To modify your control panel settings, choose
   Control Panels from the Apple menu. Extensions and drivers are located
   in the System Folder's Extensions folder.

   To determine the performance increase you can obtain by paring down
   the amount of background processing, try starting your Macintosh
   without extensions. First, choose About This Macintosh from the Apple
   menu and write down the Largest Unused Block value. Then start your
   Macintosh without extensions. (To start without extensions, hold down
   the SHIFT key when you start the Macintosh. When you see the message
   "Welcome to Macintosh Extensions Off," you can release the SHIFT key.)
   Check to see what the Largest Unused Block value is now.

   NOTE: Some extensions, control panels, and drivers are necessary for
   important tasks, such as connecting to the network, printing,
   accessing a CD-ROM drive, and so forth. Your ability to pare down your
   extensions, control panels, and drivers depends greatly on how you use
   your Macintosh.

   Use the Right Display Mode for Faster Screen Display
   ====================================================

   You may not need the millions of colors your Macintosh can support.
   Monitor settings significantly affect operations on the Macintosh that
   entail redrawing the screen (for example, screen updates that occur
   when you scroll or update graphics). If you are writing reports and
   working with spreadsheets, you may need only 16 to 256 colors. (You
   can easily switch back to using more colors if no change in
   performance occurs or if your work requires additional video
   capabilities.)

   In black-and-white mode, a single bit is used to track the color of
   each pixel on the screen. This figure increases proportionally with
   1-bit, 2-bit, 4-bit, on up to 24-bit color mode (millions of colors).
   Use the table below, which lists the memory "cost" of additional
   colors, to balance your performance needs with your display needs.

      Colors         Memory cost
   -------------------------------------------------------------------
      16             Base number (lowest cost)
      256            2 times the memory/work of 16 colors
      65K            4 times the memory/work of 16 colors
      16 million     6 times the memory/work of 16 colors

   You can set the number of colors or shades of gray your monitor can
   use by opening the Monitors control panel in Control Panels.

   Optimize Hard Disk Access
   =========================

   By optimizing your hard disk periodically, you can improve disk access
   time. The access speed of a hard disk affects overall Macintosh
   performance, more so in conditions of significant disk activity (such
   as reading or writing a file or reading an application or segments of
   an application). Because Word is a large application, a significant
   amount of hard disk access occurs when reading parts of the
   application into memory.

   File fragmentation on the hard disk can slow reading and writing.
   Fragmentation occurs with the ongoing deletion from and insertion of
   information onto the disk and results in a lack of continuous space to
   place information. With disk-intensive activities, hard disk
   fragmentation hinders the performance of your Macintosh.

   Optimizing the drive rearranges the contents of a disk so that the
   files are stored on sectors located next to one another. Optimizing a
   drive increases the speed of file access. There are several programs
   available for optimizing drives on the Macintosh.

   Virtual Memory
   ==============

   The System 7.x Virtual Memory feature swaps out portions of files and
   programs from memory to the hard disk. With the Virtual Memory feature
   turned on, a 4-MB Macintosh can perform tasks that require more than 4
   MB of memory. However, because hard disk access time is much slower
   than memory access time, virtual memory is much slower than random-
   access memory. Whenever possible, you should not use virtual memory.

</PRE><h3>How to Print Faster</h3>
 
<P>
Many factors affect printing speed. Below is a short checklist of
steps you can take that may help increase printing speed:

<UL><LI>Use printer-resident fonts instead of their TrueType(R)
   counterparts. For example, when you print to a PostScript(R)
   printer, if you normally use New York, use Times instead. These are
   very similar fonts (although Times is a bit smaller), but a font
   description for Times already exists in the printer. Therefore, the
   font definition is not added to the print job sent to the printer.
   The New York font description, however, does not exist in the
   printer, so it must be sent with the print job. Font descriptions
   can dramatically increase the size of a print job, which causes
   slower printing.

<LI>If you print over a network, consult your network documentation to
   make sure your print server is working optimally.

<LI>If you don't need to continue working while Word is printing, turn
   off the Background Printing option. This option allocates processor
   time to Word during a print job so that you can continue working;
   however, this means less processor time is available for printing.
   To turn off Background Printing, choose Chooser from the Apple
   menu, click once on your LaserWriter(R) printer on the left side.
   Under Background Printing in the bottom-right corner, click Off.
