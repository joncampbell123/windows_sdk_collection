The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Word 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Word may be unable to automatically recover your document after Word shut
down unexpectedly.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may occur when any of the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>An AutoRecover file has not been created yet.
<P>
   By default, an AutoRecover file will not be saved until after 10 minutes
   into the documents use. After 10 minutes, the AutoRecover file is
   created and if a failure shuts down Word prematurely, then Word will use
   the AutoRecover file to recover the document.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>An AutoRecover file is deleted after the document has been saved.
<P>
   A new AutoRecover file is not created until after the next
   AutoRecover duration (by default: 10 minutes into a document's use).
<P>
   -or-

<LI>The document was closed and changes were not saved.
<P>
   Once a document has been closed, the AutoRecover file is deleted. There
   is no way to recover the document once the file has been closed and
   changes were not saved.
<P>
</UL><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To change the AutoRecover Save duration, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Options (Preferences on the Macintosh), and
   then click the Save tab.

<P><LI>In the "Save AutoRecover Info Every" box, change the number to the
   desired time interval between AutoRecover saves, and click OK.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: AutoRecover is not a substitute for saving your document. When you
use AutoRecover, Word creates a temporary file to recover your document if
Word shuts down unexpectedly. You must still save your document in order to
retain your changes.
