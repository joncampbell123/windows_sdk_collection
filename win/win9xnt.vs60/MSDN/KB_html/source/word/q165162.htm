The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you delete a numbered paragraph from a numbered list, Word does not 
update the remaining list numbers correctly. This problem occurs when 
both of the following are true:

<UL><LI>The numbered list was created using an automatic numbering field,
   such as AutoNum, AutoNumOut, or AutoNumLgl.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>The "Track changes while editing" option is selected in the Highlight
   Changes dialog box (point to Track Changes and then click Highlight
   Changes on the Tools menu).
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Word cannot reflect changes to a numbered list when the numbering is the
result of a field. A field displays a result which Word treats as normal
text. If you are using the "Track changes while editing" option with the 
automatic numbering fields, Word strikes through the deleted text and 
the field. 
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, accept the revisions in your document and 
Word will update the remaining fields automatically: 

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, point to Track Changes, and then click "Accept or
   Reject Changes."

<P><LI>In the "Accept or Reject Changes" dialog box, click Accept All to
   accept all revisions in the document or click Find and accept or
   reject each revision individually. 
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this
problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base as it becomes available.
<P>
