The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the Send To command on the File menu to send a Word document
containing multiple versions to a mail recipient, all previously saved
versions are lost in the mailed document.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, insert the Word document into the mail
message as an attachment. Do not use the Send To command on the File menu
in Word.
<P>
To Attach the Word Document to a Mail Message
 
<P>
In Microsoft Exchange or Microsoft Outlook 97:

<OL><P><LI>On the Compose menu, click New Message (Exchange), or click New Mail
   Message (Outlook).

<P><LI>Click the message area of the mail message.

<P><LI>On the Insert menu, click File.

<P><LI>Click the Word document or file you want to send as an attachment. Under
   Insert As, click Attachment, and then click OK.
<P>
</OL>Your Word document or file will now appear as an icon in your mail message.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
As you are typing your document, you may want to keep various drafts of the
text. Each draft is a version of your final work. Many writers and editors
retain each version of their work as a reference. In Word 97, you can keep
a copy of the different versions within your document.
<P>
<P><h3>To Save the Current Version of Your Document</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>On the File menu, click Versions.

<P><LI>Click Save Now.

<P><LI>In the Save Version dialog box, type any comments you want saved with
   the current version of your document, and then click OK.
<P>
   NOTE: If you have not previously saved your document, you will be
   prompted to save it. In the Save As dialog box, select the folder you
   want to save your document in, enter the file name, and then click OK.
<P>
</OL><h3>To Open a Previous Version of Your Document</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>On the File menu, click Versions.

<P><LI>Under Existing Versions, click a version of your document, and then
   click Open.
<P>
</OL>For more information about how to use versions, click the Office Assistant,
type "What are versions?," click Search, and then click to view "Review
version information for a file" or "Delete one or more versions of a
document."
<P>
NOTE: If the Assistant is hidden, click the Office Assistant button on the
Standard toolbar. If Microsoft Help is not installed on your computer,
