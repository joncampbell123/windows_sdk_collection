<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Word 98 Macintosh Edition contains a new feature for browsing
through documents object by object. The Previous Page and Next Page buttons
on the vertical scroll bar have been enhanced to accomplish this.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Previous Page and Next Page buttons are black by default. When a
different browse object is selected, other than Browse by Page, the
buttons turn blue to indicate that the Previous and Next buttons have been
reassigned. The ToolTips for these buttons also indicate the current button
assignments.
<P>
For example, when Find is the browse object selected, the buttons are
reassigned to Previous Find/GoTo and Next Find/GoTo.
<P>
NOTE: The associated shortcut keys (COMMAND+PAGE UP and COMMAND+PAGE DOWN),
change their function based on the browse object selected.
<P>
The Select Browse Object button (located between the Next and Previous
buttons on the vertical scrollbar) enables you to select several object
types. The options available are:
<P>
<PRE>   GoTo
   Find
   Browse by Edits
   Browse by Heading
   Browse by Graphic
   Browse by Table
   Browse by Field
   Browse by Endnote
   Browse by Footnote
   Browse by Comment
   Browse by Section
   Browse by Page

</PRE>NOTE: Using the GoTo, Find, or Replace commands on the Edit menu also
changes the functionality of these buttons and shortcut keys. For example,
if you attempt to go to a comment, the buttons change to Previous Comment
and Next Comment.
<P>
In earlier versions of Word when you pressed the COMMAND+PAGE DOWN or
COMMAND+PAGE UP shortcut keys, Word would place the insertion point at the
top of the next or previous page. However, in Word 98 Macintosh Edition, if
you select another browse object, these keys will browse to the next object
in the appropriate direction.
