6.00 6.00a
WINDOWS
<PRE> kberrmsg

</PRE> 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 6.0, 6.0a
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, version 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups, version 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run Word 6.0 for Windows or Microsoft Excel 5.0 for Windows, one
of the following error messages may occur on some systems:
<P>
<PRE>   Cannot Read from Drive C

   The disk is full or too many files are open

</PRE>These errors should only occur on computers that have Windows for
Workgroups 3.11 pre-installed (that is, already installed on the computer
when you purchase it).
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
On computers that are not pre-installed with a network card, the following
DEVICE line is missing from the CONFIG.SYS file:
<P>
<PRE>   DEVICE=C:\WINDOWS\IFSHLP.SYS

</PRE>When this command is missing, you cannot perform certain file input and
output (I/O) operations. It is necessary for local as well as network I/O
operations. This line is sometimes included in the CONFIG.SYS file for
computers that come with a pre-installed network card but omitted from
computers with no network card.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has notified computer manufactures that pre-install Windows that
this line is necessary for all I/O operations, not just network I/O
operations.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Open your CONFIG.SYS file in a text editor such as Windows Notepad and add
the following line
<P>
<PRE>   DEVICE=C:\WINDOWS\IFSHLP.SYS

</PRE>where "C:\WINDOWS" is your Windows program directory.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The IFSHLP.SYS file is a system file responsible for interacting with 32-
bit File Access and 32-bit Disk Access operations. You usually need to
include this line to run Windows for Workgroups properly. For information
on conditions in which you do not need IFSHLP.SYS, query on the following
words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   Workgroups and IFSHLP.SYS

</PRE>Microsoft has received reports of other error messages that occur because
of the missing IFSHLP.SYS device driver.
