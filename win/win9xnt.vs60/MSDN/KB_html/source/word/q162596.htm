<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Word 97 is available in two versions: a retail version which
can be installed on any compatible computer, and an upgrade version which
requires that you have a qualifying product installed on your computer or
that you have Disk 1 from the qualifying product available when you run the
Setup program.
<P>
NOTE: The retail version does not require a qualifying product.
<P>
This article lists the products that qualify you to use the upgrade version
of Microsoft Word 97.
