The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Word, when you save a document as Hypertext Markup Language
(HTML), if the document contains images inserted in an Image Submit Form
Field ActiveX control, you cannot view the images in a Web browser, such as
Microsoft Internet Explorer.
<P>
This problem occurs with images in the following formats:

<UL><LI>Windows Metafile (WMF)
<LI>Portable Network Graphics (PNG)
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When you save the document, Word does not convert WMF and PNG images to
Graphics Interchange Format (GIF); however, your Web browser cannot display
WMF or PNG images.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To use a WMF or PNG image file in an Image Submit Form Field control, use
either of the following methods.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1: Save the Image in the Body of an HTML Document</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>After you insert the WMF or PNG image into your Word document, convert
   the Word document to HTML format by following these steps:
<P>
   a. Click Save on the File menu.
<P>
   b. In the Save As Type list, click to select HTML Document.
<P>
   c. Click Save.
<P>
   NOTE: Word coverts the WMF or PNG to GIF images. As Word converts these
   images, it assigns a file name such as Image1.gif, Image2.gif,
   Image3.gif, and so on. Word saves these files in the same directory as
   your HTML document.

<P><LI>If you want to rename the Image&lt;X&gt;.gif files, follow these steps:
<P>
   a. Click Open on the File menu, and click All Files(*.*) in the Files Of
<P><PRE>      Type list.
</PRE><P>
   b. Use the right mouse button to click (right-click) the Image&lt;X&gt;.gif
<P><PRE>      file, and then click Rename on the shortcut menu.
</PRE><P>
   c. Type a new name for the file and then press ENTER.

<P><LI>When you insert the image into the Image Submit Form Field control,
   use the file from step 2.
<P>
</OL><h3>Method 2: Use a Graphics Program to Convert the Graphic Format to GIF</h3>
 
<P>
Use a graphics program to export the WMF or PNG images to the GIF or JPEG
(JPG) image format, and then insert the GIF or JPEG image into the Image
Submit Form Field control.
<P>
To convert the image, you can use the Microsoft Paint program that comes
with Microsoft Windows, and the Microsoft Photo Editor program that comes
with Microsoft Office 97.
<P>
Use the appropriate method for your situation.
<P>
WMF Image:
<P>
To convert a WMF image using Microsoft Paint and Microsoft Photo Editor,
follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>In Word 97, click to select the WMF graphic, and then click Copy on the
   Edit menu.

<P><LI>Save the image as a bitmap in Microsoft Paint. To do this, follow these
   steps:
<P>
<P><PRE>    a. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Accessories, and then click
       Paint.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    b. In Microsoft Paint, click Paste on the Edit menu. Click Yes if you
       receive the following prompt:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>         The image in the clipboard is larger than this bitmap. Would you
         like the bitmap enlarged?

    c. On the File menu, click Save.

    d. In the Save As dialog box, navigate to the folder that contains your
       HTML document, type a file name, and then click Save to save the
       file as a bitmap.

    e. Quit Microsoft Paint by clicking Exit on the File menu.

</PRE><P><LI>Start Microsoft Photo Editor. To do this, click Start, point to
   Programs, and then click Microsoft Photo Editor.

<P><LI>In Microsoft Photo Editor, click Open on the File menu, and then open
   the bitmap file you created in step 2.

<P><LI>Click Save As on the File menu. In the Save As Type list, click to
   select GIF, type a file name, and then click Save.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Exit, and then switch to Microsoft Word.
<P>
</OL>When you insert the graphic into the Image Submit Form Field Control, use
the file you created in step 5.
<P>
PNG Image:
<P>
To convert a PNG image using Microsoft Photo Editor, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Start Microsoft Photo Editor. To do this, click Start, point to
   Programs, and then click Microsoft Photo Editor.

<P><LI>In Microsoft Photo Editor, click Open on the File menu, and then open
   the PNG file.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Save As. In the Save As Type list, click to
   select GIF, type a file name, and then Click Save.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Exit, and then switch to Microsoft Word.
<P>
</OL>When you insert the graphic into the Image Submit Form Field Control, use
the file you created in step 3.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Forms on Web Pages</h3>
 
<P>
When authoring a Web page, you can use ActiveX controls to create forms for
collecting or providing dynamic data. The controls are standard form
elements used on the World Wide Web.
<P>
Because forms require additional support files and therefore additional
server support, you should consult your network or Web administrator when
designing the form.
<P>
Every form must have one Submit or Image Submit button.
<P>
Image Submit:
<P>
This control provides a Picture dialog box that allows you to select the
image you want. When you copy the Web page to the server, you must also
copy the button image.
<P>
Submit:
<P>
This control submits the data that the user types into other form elements.
<P>
For more information about the Web page form elements that are installed
with Word, click the Office Assistant, type "image submit control," click
Search, and then click the "Form elements you can use on a Web page" topic.
<P>
NOTE: If the Assistant is hidden, click the Office Assistant button on the
Standard toolbar. If Word Help is not installed on your computer, please
see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

</PRE></OL><h3>Graphic Filters</h3>
 
<P>
This section further describes the types of graphic filters mentioned in
this article. Graphic filters allow you to use graphics formats in various
ways within Word.
<P>
Windows Metafile (WMF):
<P>
The Windows Metafile graphics filter (Wmfimp32.flt) supports the Windows
Metafile format. You must have the Windows Metafile filter to insert a WMF
file into a Word document as a Microsoft Clip Gallery object. However, you
don't need the filter to insert a WMF file directly into a Word document.
<P>
Portable Network Graphics (PNG):
<P>
The Portable Network Graphics filter (Png32.flt) supports the Portable
Network Graphics tenth specification (version 1.0). You must have the
filter to insert a PNG file into a Word document as a Microsoft Clip
Gallery object or a Photo Editor object. However, you don't need the filter
to insert a PNG file directly into a Word document. You must also have the
PNG filter to import GIF files into Word.
<P>
Graphics Interchange Format (GIF):
<P>
The Graphics Interchange Format filter (Gifimp32.flt) supports file format
versions GIF87a (including interlacing) and GIF89a (including interlacing
and transparency). The GIF filter works with the Portable Network Graphics
filter to import GIF files into Word. The HTML converter also uses the GIF
filter to export pictures in a Word document to GIF images in an HTML page.
<P>
NOTE: A limitation of the GIF filter is that it only imports the first
image of a multi-image GIF file.
<P>
JPEG File Interchange Format file (JPG):
<P>
The JPEG graphics filter (Jpegim32.flt) supports Version 6.0 of the JPEG
File Interchange Format (JFIF). You must have the JPEG filter to insert a
JPEG file into a Word document as a Microsoft Clip Gallery object or a
Photo Editor object. However you don't need the JPEG filter to insert a
JPEG file directly into a Word document.
<P>
The JPEG filter has the following limitations:

<UL><LI>The filter does not support JPEG Tagged Interchange Format (JTIF)
   files.

<LI>The filter does not support cyan-magenta-yellow-black (CMYK) JPEG
   files.
<P>
<P>
</UL>For more information about other graphic filters that Word can use, click
the Office Assistant, type "graphic filters," click Search, and then click
the "Graphic file types Word can use" topic.
