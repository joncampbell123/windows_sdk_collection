<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article discusses a method of placing graphics and text side-by-side
so that they can be used as a single object. This method can be useful when
you want to place the same graphic and text next to each other in more than
one place in a document.
<P>
For information on placing graphics next to text in multiple or merged
labels, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : How to Add a Graphic or Logo to Every Label on a Page

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 

<OL><P><LI>In a new document, insert the graphic you want to use.

<P><LI>Double-click the graphic to open it in the Picture Editor.

<P><LI>Insert a text box next to the graphic. Type the text in the text box as
   you want it to appear.

<P><LI>Choose the Reset Picture Boundary button.

<P><LI>Choose the Close Picture button.
<P>
</OL>The graphic and text are now next to each other and can be treated as a
single object.
<P>
You can make this graphic available to all documents if you make it an
AutoText entry and add it to your normal template:

<OL><P><LI>Select the new picture.

<P><LI>On the Edit menu, click AutoText.

<P><LI>In the Name box, type a name for the picture.

<P><LI>In the Make AutoText Entry Available To box, select All Documents
   (Normal.dot).

<P><LI>Click the Add button.
<P>
</OL>When you want to insert the picture in a new document, place the insertion
point where you want the picture to appear. On the Edit menu, click
AutoText. Select the name you gave the picture, and choose Insert. The
picture now appears in your document.
<P>
To use the logo in the Return Address of an envelope, place the insertion
point in the Return Address box of the Envelopes And Labels dialog box.
Type the name you gave the AutoText entry, and press F3. Note that this
method is not available to Word for the Macintosh, as the keystroke F3 is
not assigned to the AutoText command. You can make the assignment yourself,
however, by using the Customize command on the Tools menu. See the
"Microsoft Word User's Guide" for more information on how to make the
assignment.
