The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 2.0, 2.0a, 2.0a-CD, 2.0b,
   2.0c
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run the Setup program to upgrade to a later version of Word
for Windows, Setup may repeatedly prompt you to insert Word disks.
Setup eventually fails to successfully install Word.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This happens when you start the Setup program using the Word Setup
icon in the Word 2.0 group of Windows Program Manager. It does not
happen if you start Setup using the SETUP.EXE file from your Word
disks, as described on pages 8 and 9 of "Microsoft Word for Windows
Getting Started."
<P>
Setup repeatedly prompts you most frequently to insert Disk 1, but the
prompt can occur for any Word disk. Setup requests different disks,
depending on the type of installation (for example, Custom or
Complete) and how many versions the upgrade spans (for example,
version 2.0 to 2.0b versus version 2.0 to 2.0c).
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
When you install a different version of Word, run Setup from the Run
command on the File menu from Windows Program Manager or File Manager
using the new Word disks. Use the Word Setup icon only when you want
to modify the current installation of Word.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Word Setup icon uses a SETUP.INF file that is specific to the
existing version of Word and the set of disks used for that
installation. When you use the Word Setup icon to install a different
version of Word, Setup requests disks based on the file location
information in SETUP.INF, which applies only to the current Word
installation.
