<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article provides questions and answers to frequently asked questions
about using page borders in Microsoft Word 98.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 

<PRE>1. Q. Why don't the borders that I add to my document appear on every
      page?

   A. If your document contains sections, Word applied the border to the
      current section only. To apply borders that appear on every page of
      the document, follow these steps:

      a. On the Format menu, click Borders And Shading, and then click the
         Page Border tab.

      b. In the Apply To list, click Whole Document.

      c. Click OK.

2. Q. Why is the border missing on one or more sides of the page when I
      print my document?

   A. The minimum amount of space needed between the margin and the edge
      of the page varies by printer (the distance between the page border
      and the text may be greater than this margin width). To correct this
      problem, change the margins of your document.

3. Q. Why are page borders lost when I convert my Word document to HTML?

   A. There is no equivalent element in HTML. To simulate this effect in
      HTML, create a full page table and apply a border to the table.

4. Q. Why are page borders lost when I convert my Word document to earlier
      versions of Word or to a non-Word format?

   A. The page borders feature is new to Word 98. It is not supported
      by converters for earlier versions.

5. Q. Can I add custom border art to the border designs that ship with
      Word?

   A. No. The border art is stored as a collection of designs in border
      files in the Microsoft Office 98:Office:Border Art folder.

      These images are not available in individual graphics formats
      such as Windows Metafile (WMF), Tag Image File Format (TIFF), or
      other graphic formats. In addition, you cannot insert these images
      into a Word document by inserting from a file (on the Insert menu,
      point to Picture, and click From File).

6. Q. I applied a border to a page, but I don't see it when I am in normal
      view. Why?

   A. Objects placed on the drawing layer in Word do not appear in normal
      view. Word displays page borders in print preview or page layout
      views only.

7. Q. How can I get the page border to move when I adjust the margins?

   A. You can change the page border measurement to be in relation to the
      text rather than the edge of the page, by following these steps:

      a. On the Format menu, click Borders And Shading, and then click the
         Page Border tab.

      b. Click the Page Border tab.

      c. Click Options.

      d. Change the Measure From setting to Text and click OK.

      The page border should now move with the margins as you adjust the
      margins.
