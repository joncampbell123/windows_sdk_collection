The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for the Macintosh, version 5.1
<LI>Microsoft PowerPoint for the Macintosh, version 3.0
<LI>Microsoft Graph, version 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you install Word for the Macintosh, the Installer program
determines whether Microsoft Graph has already been installed by
Microsoft PowerPoint in the System Folder:Extensions:Microsoft:MSGraph
folder. Based on this determination, Installer performs one of the
actions listed below.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Graph Not Installed in System Folder</h3>
 
<P>
If Installer does not find that a copy of Microsoft Graph has already
been installed by PowerPoint in the System
Folder:Extensions:Microsoft:MSGraph folder, Installer creates this
folder and inserts an alias to the copy of Microsoft Graph it places
in the Word Commands folder. This means that only one copy of Graph
is on your hard disk.
<P>
<P><h3>Same or Older Version of Microsoft Graph Exists in System Folder</h3>
 
<P>
If the version of Microsoft Graph that Powerpoint installed is the
same or older than the one supplied with Word, Installer installs
Microsoft Graph in the Word Commands folder and adds an alias to the
other copy of Graph in the System Folder:Extensions:Microsoft:MSGraph
folder. This means two copies of Microsoft Graph are on your hard
disk.
<P>
<P><h3>Newer Version of Microsoft Graph Exists in System Folder</h3>
 
<P>
If the System Folder:Extensions:Microsoft:MSGraph folder does exist
and the version of Microsoft Graph that PowerPoint installed is newer
than the one that the Word Installer wants to install, Installer does
nothing.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Graph requires System software version 7.0 or later. Neither
Word for the Macintosh nor PowerPoint install Microsoft Graph if you
are running System software prior to version 7.0.
<P>
Version 3.0 of PowerPoint for the Macintosh and version 5.1 of Word
for the Macintosh both ship with Microsoft Graph version 3.0. As a
result, if you first install Word version 5.1 and then PowerPoint
version 3.0, there are two copies of Graph version 3.0 on your hard
disk. On the other hand, if you first install PowerPoint version 3.0
and then Word version 5.1, there is only one copy of Graph version 3.0
on your hard disk.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
If there are two copies of Microsoft Graph on your hard disk, remove
Graph from the Word Commands folder and add an alias in the Word
Commands folder that points to the copy of Graph in the System
Folder:Extensions:Microsoft:MSGraph folder.
