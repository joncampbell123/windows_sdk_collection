The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 2.0, 2.0a, 2.0a-CD, 2.0b,
   2.0c, 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows 95, versions 7.0, 7.0
<LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Word 98 Macintosh Edition
<LI>Microsoft Word for the Macintosh, versions 6.0, 6.0.1, 6.0.1a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When your document contains an address, Word may not properly identify the
address paragraphs and may not propose the correct address information in
the Address To box.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may occur when you use the following commands:

<UL><LI>The Envelopes and Labels command on the Tools menu (Word 6.x, 7.x, 97,
   98 Macintosh Edition)
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE>
<LI>The Create Envelope command on the Tools menu (Word 2.x).
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE>
<LI>The ToolsCreateEnvelope macro command (Word 2.x, 6.x, 7.x, 97)
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE>
<LI>The ToolsCreateLabel macro command (Word 6.x, 7.x, 97)
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you use these commands in an open document, Word searches the document
for an address, opens a dialog box with the proposed address, and allows
you to print the address on an envelope or label. When Word conducts an
address search, it uses the following rules:

<OL><P><LI>Word searches for any paragraphs that you defined as bookmarks
   named "EnvelopeAddress" and "EnvelopeReturn."

<P><LI>Word searches for highlighted paragraphs that represent each line
   of the address.
<P>
   Note: This will not work in Microsoft Word 97 for Windows if your
   address lines end with line feeds rather than paragraph marks.

<P><LI>Word searches for a series of paragraphs meeting the following
   criteria:
<P>
<P><PRE>      a. left-aligned
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      b. only include a few words
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      c. include three to five paragraphs in a row envelope address
<PRE></PRE>         bookmark

      d. no formatting between paragraphs

</PRE></OL>If any of these conditions are not met, Word may return an unexpected
result in the Address To box.
<P>
NOTE: If you format an address as a single paragraph (for example, if you
end each line with a new line character or SHIFT+ENTER), Word may not find
the correct address information.
<P>
Note also that if the first line of the address is formatted with space
before or space after formatting, Word will not find the address. If you
highlight the address, Word will show only the first line. This is true for
the Labels dialog box as well as for the Envelope dialog box.
<P>
Some third-party information managers, such as PackRat (for Windows), store
addresses as one paragraph with line feeds (instead of carriage returns) at
the end of each address line. In this situation, Word may not find the
three to five consecutive paragraphs that satisfy its search algorithm. To
work around this problem, replace the line feeds with carriage returns.
<P>
If a single paragraph has more than 58 characters and spaces, Word may not
find the correct address information.
