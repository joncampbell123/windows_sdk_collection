Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, click Help in
Registry Editor, click the Contents tab, and click to view the "Restoring

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how to create an exclude dictionary. An exclude
dictionary contains words that the main dictionary recognizes as being
spelled correctly, but that you want questioned during a spelling check.
Using an exclude dictionary allows you to specify preferred spellings for
certain words.
<P>
For example, if you prefer "theatre" rather than "theater," add "theater"
to the exclude dictionary so that if Word finds "theater" during a spell
check, it prompts you for the correct spelling.
<P>
Once you create an exclude dictionary, Word uses it automatically with the
main dictionary. If you want to check spelling without using the exclude
dictionary, rename the exclude dictionary before you check spelling in a
document.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Creating an Exclude Dictionary</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>In a new, blank document, type the words that you want to put in the
   exclude dictionary. After typing each word, press ENTER to make each
   word a separate paragraph, for example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      center
      theater
</PRE>
<P><LI>On the File menu, click Save As. Make sure that you save the exclude
   dictionary in the same folder (directory) that contains the main
   dictionary.
<P>
   In Word for Windows 6.x, the main dictionary is usually located in the
   following directory:
<P>
<P><PRE>      C:\Windows\Msapps\Proof
</PRE><P>
   In Word for Windows NT, the main dictionary is usually located in the
   following folder:
<P>
<P><PRE>      C:\Windows\Msapps\Proof
</PRE><P>
   In Word for Windows 95, the main dictionary is usually located in the
   following folder:
<P>
<P><PRE>      C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Proof
</PRE><P>
   On the Macintosh, the main dictionary is usually located in the
   following folder:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Macintosh HD:Microsoft
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: If you cannot find the main dictionary, see the "To Determine the
   Name and Path of the Main Dictionary" section later in this later.

<P><LI>In the Save File As Type box, select Text Only (Windows) or Speller
   Exclude Dictionary (Macintosh).

<P><LI>In the File Name box (Windows) or the Save Current Document As box
   (Macintosh), type a name for the exclude dictionary.
<P>
   In Windows, the exclude dictionary must have the same name as the
   main language dictionary (the American English dictionary is
   Mssp2_en.lex) with which it is associated. However, it must have
   the file name extension of .exc. The exclude dictionary file name
   for the American English dictionary must be named Mssp2_en.exc.
<P>
   On the Macintosh, the exclude dictionary must include the name of
   the language followed by "Exclude Dictionary." For example, an
   exclude dictionary for both English (US) and English (UK) would be
   named "English Exclude Dictionary."

<P><LI>Click OK (Windows), or Save (Macintosh).
<P>
   If Word prompts you to confirm that you want to save the file with
   formatting that will not be saved in text format, click Yes, and then
   click Text Only (Windows) or Speller Exclude Dictionary (Macintosh).
<P>
</OL><h3>To Determine the Name and Path of the Main Dictionary</h3>
 
<P>
Word for Windows 6.x
<P>
<PRE>   The name and path of the main dictionary can be found in the Win.ini
   file located in the Windows folder.

   1. Do one of the following appropriate for your operating system:

      Windows 3.x:

         a. In File Manager, click Run on the File menu.

         b. On the command line, type SYSEDIT and then click OK.

      Windows 95:

         a. On the Start menu, click Run.

         b. In the Open box, type SYSEDIT and then click OK.

   2. The System Configuration Editor appears. Click Window on the menu bar
      and select the Win.ini file.

      NOTE: The Win.ini file should now be displayed for editing.

   3. This file is divided into sections illustrated by square brackets
      ([section name]). Scroll through the file until you see the
      [MS Proofing Tools] section.

      The path and file name of the main dictionary are located at the end
      of the Spelling entry as in the following example:

         Spelling 1033,0=C:\WINDOWS\MSAPPLS\PROOF\MSSPEL2.DLL,
         C:\WINDOWS\MSAPPS\PROOF\MSSP2_EN.LEX

      Mssp2_en.lex is the name of the main dictionary in this example.
      Whatever the name of the dictionary is, the file name ends with the
      ".lex" extension.

   4. On the File menu, click Edit. Close the Configuration Editor without
      saving any changes.

<P>
<PRE>   WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems
   that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft
   cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of
   Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

   For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys
   And Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and
   Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics
   in Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you
   edit it. If you are running Windows NT, you should also update your
   Emergency Repair Disk (ERD).

   1. In the File Manager, click Run on the File menu.

   2. On the command line, type REGEDIT (Windows NT 4.0) or REGEDT32
      (Windows NT 3.5x) and then click OK.

   3. In the Registry Editor, locate and view the following registry key:

         HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Shared Tools\Proofing Tools

   4. The Proofing Tools key contains the value names and value data to the
      Dictionary and Engine files.

      NOTE: The Dictionary has a .lex file extension.

   5. Close the registry without making any changes.


</PRE>Word for Windows 95
<P>
<PRE>   Use the RegOptions macro:

   The name and path of the main dictionary can be found using the
   RegOptions macro that is contained in the Macros7.dot template.

   1. If Macros7.dot is already loaded globally, skip to step 2. Otherwise,
      follow these steps:

      a. On the File menu, click Templates.

      b. Click Add to add a global template.

      c. Locate the Macros7.dot file (usually this file is in the
         \Winword\Macros folder).

         NOTE: If the Macros folder does not exist on your computer, the
         macros may not have been installed when you set up Word. If so,
         you need to run Word Setup again and select the Macros option.

      d. Select the template and click OK twice.

   2. On the Tools menu, click Macro.

   3. Verify that Macros7.dot is selected in the Macros Available In box.

   4. In the Macros list, select the RegOptions macro and then click Run.

   5. Select Word 7.0 Options in the Section drop-down list, select Tools
      Path in the Option drop-down list and view the path in the Setting
      box. Click OK when finished. (You may have to click in the Setting
      Window and press the END key to see the entire path and file name.)

   Look in the Windows Registry:

   WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems
   that may require you to reinstall Windows 95. Microsoft cannot guarantee
   that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be
   solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

   For information about how to edit the registry, view the Changing Keys
   And Values online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Note that
   you should understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs
   after you edit it. For information about how to do this, click Help in
   Registry Editor, click the Contents tab, and click to view the
   "Restoring the Registry" topic.

   1. To open the registry, click Run on the Start menu, and type "REGEDIT"
      (without the quotation marks).

   2. Locate and view the following registry key:

         HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Word\7.0\Proofing
         Tools\Spelling\1033\Normal\

   3. The Normal key contains the value names and value data to the
      Dictionary and Engine files.

      NOTE: The Dictionary has a .lex file extension.

   4. Close the registry without making any changes.
