The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The following true type fonts, available in earlier versions of Word for
Windows, are no longer available in Word 97. This functionality is by
design.

<UL><LI>Arial CE
<LI>Arial Cyr
<LI>Arial Greek
<LI>Bookshelf Symbol 1
<LI>Bookshelf Symbol 2
<LI>Courier New CE
<LI>Courier New Cyr
<LI>Courier Greek
<LI>MS LineDraw
<LI>Times New Roman CE
<LI>Times New Roman Cyr
<LI>Times New Roman Greek
<P>
</UL>The following vector fonts available in earlier versions of Word for
Windows are no longer available in Word 97. This functionality is by
design.

<UL><LI>Modern
<LI>Roman
<LI>Script
<P>
</UL>Screen fonts are not available in Microsoft Word 97 for Windows or earlier
versions of Word for Windows. Screen fonts may include:

<UL><LI>Fixedsys
<LI>MS Sans Serif
<LI>MS Serif
<LI>Small Fonts
<LI>System
<LI>Terminal
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>MS LineDraw</h3>
 
<P>
The MS LineDraw font is identified as a symbol font. Therefore, Word 97
will interpret text typed in the MS LineDraw font as a series of symbols
and many of formatting and proofing features of Word will ignore the text.
<P>
Courier New contains the exact same character set as MS LineDraw. Existing
documents formatted with the MS LineDraw font will be mapped to Courier
New when opened in Word 97.
<P>
To access the line drawing characters that used to be available in MS
LineDraw, click Symbol on the Insert menu, change the font to (normal
text), and change the Subset to Box Drawing.
<P>
<P><h3>Bookshelf Symbol</h3>
 
<P>
Bookshelf Symbol 1 and Bookshelf Symbol 2 fonts are not proper symbol
fonts. Because Word 97 supports Unicode, these fonts are unusable in Word
97. In many cases, if a converted document contains these fonts, you will
get "empty" characters, represented by a square box.
<P>
You can force Word to use the Bookshelf Symbol 1 and Bookshelf Symbol 2
fonts by following these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Select the text you want formatted for the font or place the insertion
   point in the desired location.

<P><LI>Select the font name in the Font box on the Formatting toolbar.

<P><LI>Press the BACKSPACE or DELETE key on your keyboard to delete the font
   name.

<P><LI>Type in the desired font name exactly as it is listed in Windows. In
   this case type "Bookshelf Symbol 1" or "Bookshelf Symbol 2" (without the
   quotation marks).

<P><LI>Press ENTER.
<P>
</OL>The font will now be applied.
<P>
<P><h3>International Fonts</h3>
 
<P>
International font sets that are available in Word 7.0 are not
automatically available in Word 97. Word 97 makes available only the fonts
that are determined by the language and keyboard setting in Windows 95.
<P>
For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : Word 97: International Fonts Don't Appear in Font List

</PRE></OL><h3>Vector Fonts</h3>
 
<P>
Vector fonts use an older font technology and the quality of the printed
output is very poor. Because of the poor printed quality, these fonts were
removed from the font drop-down box in Microsoft Word 97. 
<P>
Examples of this type of font are the Roman, Modern, and Script. They are
mostly used by Plotter printers under Microsoft Windows 3.x.
<P>
<P><h3>Screen Fonts</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft Word is designed to produce WYSIWYG (What you see is what you
get) output. In order to attain that goal, the text that is displayed on
the screen must be able to be printed. If the text is formatted with a
screen font, then a font substitution must occur when the document is
printed because screen fonts are for display only and cannot be printed.
<P>
Performing a font substitution when printing may produce non-WYSIWYG
output. For this reason, screen fonts are not available in the font
drop-down box.
<P>
You may still force Word to use a screen font to display the text by typing
in the name of the font, exactly as it is named in Windows, into the font
drop-down box and pressing ENTER.
