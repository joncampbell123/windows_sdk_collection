The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows 95, version 7.0
<LI>Microsoft Word for the Macintosh, versions 6.0, 6.0.1, 6.0.1a
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows NT, version 6.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The first time you update fields in a document in which revision marks are
turned on, Word marks the result of each field as deleted and reinserted.
For example, if your document contains a PAGE field, Word displays the page
number twice, marked once for deletion (with strikethrough formatting) and
once for insertion (with underline formatting).
<P>
This behavior affects all parts of your Word document, including footnotes,
headers and footers, table of contents, or annotations, even if you have
not modified the field or its contents. It only happens once for each
field, the first time Word updates the field while revision marking is
turned on. (To turn on revision marks, click Revisions on the Tools menu,
select the Mark Revisions While Editing option, and then click OK.)
<P>
NOTE: Word automatically updates fields in the header and footer when you
print your document. If you turn on the Update Fields option, Word updates
all the fields in your document each time you print. (To locate the Update
Fields option, click Options on the Tools menu and select the Print tab.)
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Use one of the following methods to prevent Word from displaying field
results as deleted and reinserted:
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1</h3>
 
<P>
Lock the field by selecting the field and pressing CTRL+F11 before you
print or perform another operation that updates fields.
<P>
NOTE: The field can be unlocked by selecting the field and pressing 
CTRL+SHIFT+F11.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 2</h3>
 
<P>
Accept all revisions and turn off revisions marking before you print or 
perform another operation that updates fields.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 3</h3>
 
<P>
Clear the "Mark Revisions While Editing" check box (on the Tools menu click 
Revisions). Then, print your document or view it in print preview. When 
you're done printing, select the "Mark Revisions While Editing" check box 
to turn this feature back on.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
This has been corrected in version 7a and later for Windows and Microsoft 
Word 98 Macintosh Edition. For additional information, please see the 
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
