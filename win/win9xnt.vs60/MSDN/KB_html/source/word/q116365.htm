The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 6.0, 6.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After you edit a bitmap that you created by pressing PRINT SCREEN or
ALT+PRINT SCREEN to capture the current screen display, Word for Windows
may have very little available memory, and either of the following error
messages may occur:
<P>
<PRE>   This is an invalid embedded object.

   -or-

   Out of memory.

</PRE>Once either of these messages occurs, additional errors usually occur when
you perform any other operations in Word.
<P>
Note: To check available memory in Word, choose About Microsoft Word from
the Help menu, and then choose the System Info button.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The editing of an embedded screen capture object consumes available memory,
which Word should restore when you finish editing the object. However, Word
does not release the memory, which leaves you with insufficient memory for
subsequent Word operations.
<P>
Furthermore, Word does not release the memory when you close the file that
contains the screen capture object. You must quit and restart Word to
restore available system memory.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Word versions 6.0 and 6.0a
for Windows. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Paste the screen capture object in Windows Paintbrush, save it as a bitmap
(.BMP) file, then insert the .BMP file in your Word document.
