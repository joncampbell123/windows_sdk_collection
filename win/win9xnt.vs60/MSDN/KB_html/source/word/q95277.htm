<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes various methods you can use to create a watermark in
Microsoft Word. A watermark, as defined in this article, is any text or
graphic that is printed to overlap existing text in a document, either in
the background or foreground. For example, a logo printed lightly behind a
letter or the word "Confidential" printed lightly on a contract might be
considered a watermark. Some of the most commonly used watermarks are:

<UL><LI>Confidential
<LI>Paid
<LI>Draft
<P>
</UL>The four methods listed here are just a few examples of how you can
create a watermark in Word.

<UL><LI>Use a text box (Word 6.0 and later)
<LI>Use the Watermark macro from the Supplemental Macros Application Note
   (Word 6.0 for Windows and later)
<LI>Use the Watermark macro from NEWMACRO.DOC (Word 2.0 only; for
   PostScript printers only)
<LI>Set absolute margins and place watermark in the Header/Footer (Word 2.0
   for Windows and later and Word 5.0 for Macintosh and later)
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Use the any of the following methods to create a watermark.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1 (Word 6.0 and later): Use a Text Box</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Position the insertion point on the page where you want the
   watermark to be placed. If you want the watermark to appear
   on every page in the document or that section, position the
   insertion point in the header by choosing Header and Footer
   from the View menu.

<P><LI>On the View menu, click Toolbars.

<P><LI>Select the Drawing toolbar and click OK.
<P>
   The drawing toolbar should appear below your Word document.

<P><LI>Click the Text Box button (sixth button from the left) on the
   Drawing toolbar.

<P><LI>Click and drag the mouse pointer to specify the size of the
   text box needed for the text or graphic you'll be using.

<P><LI>Insert a graphic by choosing Picture from the Insert menu, or
   type the watermark text.
<P>
   Note: To rotate the text, you need to use WordArt. For details of
   how to do this, see the "How to Create Rotated Watermark Text" section
   of this article. 
<P>
   Note: If you need to enlarge the font, select the text and change
   the point size to approximately 72 pts.

<P><LI>To move the text box, select the border and drag it to its new
   location. To resize the text box, select the border, and then drag
   one of the sizing handles. You can also move or resize the
   text box with specific measurements by choosing Drawing Object
   from the Format menu.
<P>
</OL><h3>Method 2 (Word 6.x): Use the Watermark Macro</h3>
 
<P>
This macro is available in the Supplemental Macros Application Note.
<P>
The Watermark macro prompts you with a dialog box that asks you to enter
the text or graphic. It then inserts the text or graphic into a text box
that is placed in the current section's header.
<P>
For information on how to obtain the Supplemental Macros Application Note,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../word/q123606.htm">Q123606</A></B>
   TITLE:WD: Supplemental Macros for Word 6.0 for Windows Available

</PRE></OL><h3>Method 3 (Word 2.0 only): Use the Watermark Macro from Newmacro.doc</h3>
 
<P>
The Watermark macro inserts text underneath the original text of the
document. You must print the results to a PostScript printer.
<P>
The macro can be found by opening the Newmacro.doc from the
&lt;drive&gt;:\WINWORD directory, where WINWORD is the Word program directory.
Choose the Watermark macro from the list of available macros and then click
Install.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 4: Set Absolute Margins to Overlap Header and Document Text</h3>
 
<P>
By adjusting the top margin, you can add a watermark text/graphic to the
header so that it overlaps existing text in the document.

<OL><P><LI>In Word version 2.0, choose Page Setup from the Format menu. In Word
   version 6.0 and later for Windows, choose Page Setup from the File menu.
   In Word version 6.0 for Macintosh, choose Document Layout from the File
   menu. In Word version 5.x, choose Document from the Format menu.

<P><LI>Select the Margins option/tab and place a MINUS SIGN in front of the Top
   Margin. For example, a 1 inch top margin becomes -1 inch margin. Click
   OK.

<P><LI>From the View menu, verify that Normal is selected.

<P><LI>From the View menu, choose Header and Footer. In Word 2.0 and Word 5.0,
   select Header. Click OK.

<P><LI>Insert a graphic by choosing Picture from the Insert menu; or type the
   watermark text. To rotate the text, see the section entitled "How to
   Create Rotated Watermark Text". If you are not rotating the text but
   need to enlarge it, select the text and change the point size to
   approximately 72 points.

<P><LI>To position the Watermark centered on the page, you can place the
   watermark in a frame or format the paragraph with Spacing Before:
<P>
   To create a frame:
<P>
   a. Select the text/graphic.
<P>
   b. On the Insert menu, click Frame.
<P>
   c. To move the frame, select the border and drag it to its new location.
<P><PRE>      To resize the frame, select the border and drag one of the sizing
      handles. You can also move or resize the frame with specific
      measurements by clicking Frame on the Format menu. Set both
      Horizontal and Vertical position to Center Relative to Margins or
      Page.
</PRE><P>
   To format the paragraph for spacing before:
<P>
   a. Select the text/graphic.
<P>
   b. On the Format menu, click Paragraph.
<P>
<PRE>   c. In the Spacing Before text box, type one of the following       
      measurements: 18 li, 216 pt, or 3 in (6 li = 72 pts = 1 inch). Click
      OK.

      For example, "3 in" provides 3 inches of space between the margin and
      the watermark text. You may need to adjust the Spacing Before setting
      to achieve proper vertical spacing.

   d. To center between the left and right margins, click the Center Align
      button on the Formatting toolbar in Word 2.0, 6.0 and 7.0 or on the
      Header ruler in Word 5.x.

      NOTE: You can also use this procedure to add landscape text or
      graphics to the margin area of a page printed in portrait mode.

</PRE></OL><h3>Creating Rotated Watermark Text</h3>
 
<P>
In Word for Windows 2.0 and later and Word 6.x for the Macintosh, you can
use WordArt to create these types of words formatted in large, lightly
colored text that is rotated 45 degrees. In Word 5.x for Macintosh, you can
use Picture Editor to do the same. Use the appropriate method for your
version of Word.
<P>
Method 2: Word 2.x, 6.x, 7.x:

<OL><P><LI>On the Insert menu, click Object.

<P><LI>Select Microsoft WordArt. Click OK.

<P><LI>In the "Enter Your Text Here" dialog box, type the watermark text.

<P><LI>Change the Font Size from Best Fit to the desired size.

<P><LI>On the Format menu, click Shading.
<P>
   NOTE: On the Macintosh, the Shading button can be found under the Fill
   option (second button from the left).

<P><LI>Change the Foreground drop down list box from Black to Gray or Silver
   --Silver being lighter than Gray. Click OK.

<P><LI>On the Format menu, click Rotation And Effects.
<P>
   NOTE: On the Macintosh, use the Special Effects button which can be
   found under the Stretch option (third button from the left).

<P><LI>In the Rotation text box, type 45. Click OK.

<P><LI>Make any other formatting changes necessary to produce the watermark
   needed. When finished formatting, click outside of the WordArt object
   border. This will return your insertion point to the header.
<P>
</OL>Method 2: Word 5.x for the Macintosh (and a PostScript Printer):

<OL><P><LI>On the View menu, verify that Ruler is selected. On the Ruler, click the
   Centered paragraph alignment button.

<P><LI>Select the watermark text. On the Format menu, click Character.
   Select a large font size (such as 72 pt). Select the Outline
   option and click OK.

<P><LI>The watermark text should still be selected. Copy the watermark
   text as a picture by pressing COMMAND+OPTION+D.

<P><LI>From the Insert menu, choose Picture. Click New Picture.

<P><LI>From the Edit menu, choose Paste. The watermark text will appear.
<P>
   NOTE: If the watermark text wraps when you paste it in the picture
   window, set the left and right document margins to 0 (zero) inches
   before you press COMMAND+OPTION+D in step 3 above.

<P><LI>Select the watermark text in the picture window. Click the
   rotation tool and drag one of the sizing handles to rotate the
   text approximately 40 degrees.

<P><LI>Close the Edit Picture window.
<P>
   A border appears around the graphic in the header window.

<P><LI>To remove this border, select the graphic, and from the Format menu,
   choose Border. Select None and click OK.
<P>
</OL><h3>How to Fine Tune the Color of the Watermark</h3>
 
<P>
If the watermark interferes with the legibility of the text on the
page, you can use any of these procedures to lighten it:

<UL><LI>To lighten straight text, on the Format menu, click Font, and then
   change the Color option to Lt Gray.

<LI>To lighten WordArt text, double-click the object, and then change the
   Shading foreground color to Silver instead of Gray.

<LI>To lighten drawing objects, choose Drawing Object on the Format menu,
   and then change the color to the desired gray shading.

<LI>Imported graphics can usually be lightened using the Picture Editor.
   Double-click the picture. Click the Select Drawing Objects tool, and
   then select the whole object. Choose the Fill Color button and
   change the color to Gray or Silver. Also, note that you can use a
   graphics program to alter the color of the graphic.
