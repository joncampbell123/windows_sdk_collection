The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows 95, version 7.0
<LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Word for Windows allows you to embed TrueType fonts in your
Word document so that you can view and edit the fonts (if licensing
rights allow), even if you open the document on a machine that does not
have the font installed.
<P>
To embed TrueType fonts in a saved document:

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu click Options.

<P><LI>Click the Save tab.

<P><LI>Select the Embed TrueType Fonts checkbox.
<P>
</OL>Not all fonts are licensed so that they can be embedded. If a font can
be embedded, it will increase your document's file size by
approximately the size of the font .TTF file.
<P>
NOTE: Some fonts treat normal, bold, italic, and bold-italic as
separate font .TTF files. In this case, your document's file size is
larger when you use bold and italic formatting than it is if you do
not.
<P>
If a font does not have a bold, italic, or bold-italic version of the
font, then Windows generates bold or italic from the core font. In this
case, your file does not grow in size when you use bold or italic
formatting.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Font embedding licensing rights determine how the font may be embedded
in the document.

<PRE>   Font Licensed As   Result
   ----------------   ------

   Protected          The font may not be embedded, copied, or
                      modified. If you use a protected font in a
                      document and this document is opened on a machine
                      that does not have the font installed on it, a
                      font substitution occurs. Word substitutes the
                      closest font available on the machine for the
                      missing protected font.

   Print/Preview      The font is embedded and temporarily loaded on
                      the target machine. Documents that contain
                      print/preview fonts must be opened read-only, and
                      no edits are stored in the document. Embedding
                      a font of this nature has the least impact on
                      file size increase.

   Editable           The font behaves just like the print/preview
                      fonts, except that you may also apply the font to
                      other text in the same document.

   Installable        The font is installed on the target machine
                      permanently when you open the document. This
                      allows you to use the new fonts as if you
                      installed the fonts directly into Windows
                      yourself. This type of embedded font has the
                      greatest impact on file size because the entire
                      font or fonts are included with the document. The
                      size of the font file can vary greatly. To
                      estimate the font file size, do the following:

                      Windows 95:

                         1. Click Settings On the Start menu and
                            click Control Panel.
                         2. Double-click the Fonts icon.
                         3. Right-click on the desired font and click
                            Properties on the shortcut menu. The size
                            of the font on disk is listed for "Size:".

                      Windows 3.1x:

                         1. In Program Manager, start Control Panel.
                         2. Click the Fonts icon.
                         3. Select the font in question.
                         4. Read the bottom of the dialog box. The size
                            of the font on disk is listed.

                       You can check the sizes of all of the font files
                       you use in your document. The total gives you a
                       rough idea of how much larger the file will be
                       if you embed TrueType fonts (assuming all of the
                       fonts used in your document are installable
                       fonts).

                       NOTE: The TrueType fonts that ship with Windows
                       3.1 or Windows for Workgroups may not follow
                       this behavior since there is no need to embed the
                       fonts. (They should be available on all Windows
                       3.1 or Windows for Workgroups machines.) Examples
                       of these fonts are Arial, Courier New, Times New
                       Roman, Symbol, and Wingdings.
