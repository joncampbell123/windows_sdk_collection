The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows NT, version 6.0
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows 95, versions 7.0, 7.0a
<LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Word for the Macintosh, versions 6.0, 6.0.1, 6.0.1a
<LI>Microsoft Word 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Word will not do a fast save of your document, even when the Allow Fast
Saves option is selected.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This functionality is by design. The following are some reasons why Word
will not perform a Fast Save of your document:

<UL><LI>When you save a document for the first time Word performs a full
   (normal) save to write the file to the drive.

<LI>When your document is located on a network server or remote volume,
   the Fast Save option is ignored because Word will only perform a fast
   save to a local volume, such as your local hard disk or a floppy disk.

<LI>When you click Save As and save the document under a new name, in a
   different location or in a different file format.

<LI>Word has reached the limit of how much information it can save using the
   Fast Save option. In this case, Word performs a full (normal) save and
   the Fast Save option is ignored. The fast saves option is again
   available the next time you save the document following a full save.

<LI>When you select the Make Backup option in the Save As dialog box,
   Word must do a full (normal) save, so the Fast Save option is ignored.

<LI>The Fast Save option is disabled (unchecked).
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you select the Allow Fast Saves check box, Word appends only the
changes to the document. This takes less time than a full save, in which
Word saves the complete, revised document.
<P>
<P><h3>When Should You Do a Full Save?</h3>
 

<UL><LI>Before you share a document with other people.

<LI>When you finish working on a document and save it for the last time.

<LI>Before you begin a task that uses a lot of memory, such as searching for
   text or compiling an index.

<LI>Before you transfer the document text to another program.

<LI>Before you convert the document to a different file format.
<P>
</UL><h3>To Set (or Clear) the Allow Fast Save Option</h3>
 
<P>

<P>
On the Tools menu, click Preferences. On the Save tab, click to select
(or clear) the Allow Fast Saves check box.
