The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
<LI>Microsoft Windows 95 operating system
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you a delete a file from the File Find search results window, the
files are deleted from the system and are never placed in the Recycle Bin.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Programs that are not designed specifically for Windows 95 are not "Recycle
Bin aware." Hence, they do not move files to the Recycle Bin; they delete
the files permanently.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
To place files into the Recycle Bin before you remove them permanently from
the hard disk, do one of the following:
<P>
Method 1: Use the Windows Explorer to delete your files.
<P>
Method 2: Upgrade to Word for Windows 95.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following table shows which programs delete files to the Recycle Bin in
Windows 95.
