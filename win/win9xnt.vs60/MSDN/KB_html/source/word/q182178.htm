</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you attempt to distribute drawing objects horizontally, relative to
page, and the page orientation is set to landscape, the drawing objects are
distributed calculated on a portrait orientation page width instead of the
landscape orientation page width.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>

</PRE>The following Visual Basic for Applications macro provides a workaround for
this problem. Run this macro to evenly distribute selected drawing objects
horizontally between margins.
<P>
After you create the macro, you can assign the macro to a toolbar button or
menu item.
<P>
<PRE>   Sub DistributeHoriz()
      Dim iTxtArea As Integer
      Dim iCenters As Integer
      Dim iObjLeft As Integer
      Dim iNumObj As Integer
      ' Get number of selected objects.
      iNumObj = Selection.ShapeRange.Count
      ' If there are no objects selected,
      ' exit this routine.
      If iNumObj = 0 Then Exit Sub
      ' Get area distance between margins.
      With ActiveDocument.PageSetup
         iTxtArea = (.PageWidth - (.LeftMargin + .RightMargin))
      End With
      ' Divide evenly the Text Area between margins
      ' by the number of selected objects. Then
      ' divide by two to get divisional centers.
      iDivisionCenters = (iTxtArea / iNumObj) / 2
      ' Loop number of selected objects to distribute horizontally.
      For i = 1 To iNumObj
         With Selection.ShapeRange(i)
            ' Set each selected object's relative horizontal position
            ' to be relative to margin.
            .RelativeHorizontalPosition =wdRelativeHorizontalPositionMargin
            ' Calculate object placement.
            iObjLeft = ((iTxtArea / iNumObj) * i) - iDivisionCenters
            .Left = iObjLeft - (.Width / 2)
         End With
      Next
   End Sub

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
You can align two or more drawing objects relative to each other by their
left, right, top, or bottom edges or by their centers (vertically) or
middles (horizontally).
<P>
To align one or more drawing objects relative to each other, follow these
steps:

<OL><P><LI>Select the drawing objects you want to align.

<P><LI>Click Draw on the Drawing toolbar.

<P><LI>Point to Align Or Distribute and then click the alignment you want.
<P>
</OL>By default, drawing objects align in relation to each other.
<P>
To align one or more drawing objects relative to the entire page, follow
these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Select the drawing objects, click Draw, point to Align Or Distribute,
   and click Relative To Page.

<P><LI>Click Draw again, point to Align Or Distribute, and then click the
   alignment you want.
<P>
</OL>You can also use the Align Or Distribute command to arrange or distribute
drawing objects equal distances from each other vertically, horizontally,
or in relation to the entire page.
