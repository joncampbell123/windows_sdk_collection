The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When Automatic Save is active and you restart Word 6.0 after your
computer hangs (stops responding) or after a loss of power, Automatic
Save will rename all of its files from *.ASD to *.BAK before it
attempts to recover them. (To verify that Automatic Save Every is
selected, choose Options from the Tools menu and select the Save tab.)
<P>
This may cause a problem if you are low on memory when you restart
Word. All of the files previously loaded may not be reloaded due to
lack of system resources.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When more automatically saved (AutoSave) files exist than are
recovered, you can open the files by going to the subdirectory where
AutoSave files are stored. To determine this location, choose Options
from the Tools menu, select the File Locations tab, and check the
location for AutoSave Files.
<P>
Search the indicated directory for *.BAK files and open them as you
would open any file in Word. If no location entry exists for the
AutoSave files, open the AUTOEXEC.BAT file and locate the line that
begins "Set Temp=". The directory indicated after this statement will
be the directory to search for the *.BAK files.
<P>
Word renames the AutoSave files to *.BAK so that Word won't hang if
one or more of the files are found to be corrupted when Word attempts
to reopen these documents.
