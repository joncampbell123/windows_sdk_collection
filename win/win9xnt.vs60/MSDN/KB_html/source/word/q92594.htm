The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 2.0, 2.0a, 2.0a-CD, and 2.0b
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In a Word for Windows document, if you are in outline view and reference a
bookmark located at least seven levels deep that is formatted for auto
update, legal format outline numbering, the following error message occurs:
<P>
<PRE>   The document is too large for Word to handle.

</PRE>This error occurs regardless of the location of the bookmark reference, as
long as the location and formatting of the bookmark itself matches the
above description.
<P>
This problem occurs only under the specific conditions described above. It
does not occur when you use a different numbering format.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the versions of
Microsoft Word for Windows listed above. This problem was corrected
in Word version 6.0 for Windows.
<P>
To obtain new or updated Microsoft products, call the Microsoft Sales
Information Center at (800) 426-9400. If you are outside the United
States, contact the Microsoft subsidiary for your area. To locate
your subsidiary, call Microsoft International Customer Service at
(425) 936-8661.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
After the above error message occurs, any or all of the following error
messages may appear. In all cases, Word for Windows terminates. Sometimes
the system stops responding (hangs), which forces you to restart (reboot)
your computer.

<UL><LI>Unrecoverable disk error on file rosoft Word 2.0.
<P>
   NOTE: The word "rosoft" is a truncation of the word "Microsoft."

<LI>There is an unrecoverable disk error on file.

<LI>An error has occurred in your application. If you choose to Ignore, you
   should save your work in a new file. If you choose to close, your
   application will terminate.
<P>
<P><PRE>    Note: If you choose the Ignore button, the same error message returns.
    If you choose the Close button, the following error message occurs:
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       MS Word caused a general protection Fault in module WINWORD.EXE at
       XXXX:XXXX
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    When you choose the Close button, the application terminates. You
    should quit and restart Windows to prevent further application errors.
</PRE><P>
</UL><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
In the Bullets And Numbering dialog box, clear the Auto Update check box.
This prevents the above error messages from occurring when you reference
the bookmark.
