The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, version 2.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The following error may appear when when you try to open a file in
version 2.0a of Word for Windows:
<P>
<PRE>   System Error: Cannot read from drive "N"

</PRE>where "N" is a drive letter from a-z. This error may occur even when
Word should not be accessing the drive indicated in the error message.
This article describes conditions under which Word incorrectly accesses
a drive, thereby generating the above error message.
<P>
This problem does not occur in versions 2.0, 2.0b, and 2.0c of Word for
Windows. In these versions, the "Cannot read from drive &lt;n&gt;" error message
only occurs appropriately, when you attempt to read from the active drive
when it is inaccessible. For example, Word displays this error message when
you try to access a floppy disk drive when it contains no disk. To resolve
the error, place a floppy disk in the drive and choose the Retry button.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In version 2.0a of Word for Windows, this error message occurs
inappropriately in the following situations:

<UL><LI>When a special driver is loaded to allow your PC to exchange data with a
   mainframe computer, the error message occurs when no connection to the
   mainframe exists. Word cannot access the mainframe drive, even though it
   appears in the Drives list in the Open dialog box.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE>
<LI>If you remove a moveable hard disk or a floppy disk, the drive continues
   to appear in the Drives list. Word reports that it cannot read from the
   drive, even though it should not be accessing the moveable hard disk or
   floppy disk drive.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE>
<LI>When you open and close a file from a floppy disk drive, then choose
   Open from the File menu. The "Cannot read from drive &lt;n&gt;" error appears,
   and you must choose the Cancel button eight or ten times before the
   error clears and the Open dialog box opens to allow you to open another
   file.
<P>
</UL><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Insert a floppy disk containing a Word for Windows document into a
   floppy disk drive.

<P><LI>Start version 2.0a of Word for Windows. From the File menu, choose Open.

<P><LI>In the Drives list, choose the floppy disk drive and choose the OK
   button.

<P><LI>In the File Name list, choose the Word document and choose the OK
   button.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Close. Remove the floppy disk from the drive.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Open. The error message occurs and you must
   choose the Cancel button eight or ten times before the Open dialog box
   opens.
<P>
 Note: This problem does not occur if you access the floppy drive but do
 not open a file from it.
<P>
</OL>Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Word for Windows version
2.0a. This problem was corrected in Word for Windows version 2.0b. To
