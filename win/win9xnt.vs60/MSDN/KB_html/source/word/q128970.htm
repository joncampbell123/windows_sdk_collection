This article describes how to print envelopes correctly from Word to the

<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>To print envelopes from the Envelope Dialog Box</h3>
 
<P>
Follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>From the Tools menu, choose Envelopes And Labels. Select the Envelope
   tab.

<P><LI>Type the return and destination addresses.

<P><LI>Choose the Options button. Select the Printing Options tab.

<P><LI>Choose the Center Portrait icon (second from the left), and make sure
   the Face Up option is selected and the Clockwise Rotation check box is
   selected.

<P><LI>Select the Envelope Options tab. Under Envelope Size, select Size 10
   (4 1/8 x 9 1/2 in). If desired, add bar codes and change the font of
   the return and/or destination addresses. Choose OK.

<P><LI>Choose the Print button. The Print dialog box should appear.

<P><LI>Remove all paper from the printer tray and move the paper guide out to
   accommodate the envelope's width. On the back of the printer, move the
   paper selector lever to the envelope icon. Open the front of the
   printer, move the internal paper selector to the envelope setting (to
   the far right).

<P><LI>Place the envelope in the sheet feeder. Straighten the envelope as
   needed, but DO NOT push the envelope down into the feed mechanism (the
   printer will pull the envelope appropriately).
<P>
   NOTE: The envelope is fed face up, with the flap against the back of the
   paper guide and with the top of the envelope feeding into the printer
   first.
<P>
   For further instructions on setting up the printer for printing
   envelopes, see pages 22-23 of the Color StyleWriter 2400 user's guide.

<P><LI>In the Print dialog box, select your Image (Color, Grayscale, or Black &amp;
   White), Quality (Best, Normal or Draft). Choose the Print button.
<P>
</OL>The envelope will now print correctly.
<P>
<P><h3>To Print Envelopes Using Mail Merge</h3>
 
<P>
Click Mail Merge on the Tools menu, and follow these steps.

<OL><P><LI>In the Mail Merge Helper Dialog Box, follow these steps.
<P>
   Step 1: Main Document.
<P>
<P><PRE>      Click Create Envelopes. Select Active Window or New Main Document.
</PRE>   
   Step 2: Data Source. Click Create Data Source.
   
<P><PRE>      If your data file has already been created, select Get Data, and then
      select Open Data Source from the list that appears. Select your data
      file in the Open dialog box and choose Open.
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: Skip steps 2, 3, and 8 if you opened an existing data file in step
   3.

<P><LI>Choose the desired fields (for example, Title, First Name, Last Name,
   Address, and so forth) and select OK.

<P><LI>Give the data source (data document) a name in the Save Current Document
   As box and save the document.

<P><LI>In the next dialog box, click the Set Up Main Document button, which
   will open the Envelope Options dialog box.

<P><LI>Select the Envelope Options tab and select the envelope size (Size 10).

<P><LI>Select the Printing Options tab, and select the Center Portrait icon for
   the Feed Method (second from the left). Also make sure that Face Up and
   Clockwise Rotation are selected. Choose OK.

<P><LI>In the Envelope Address dialog box, insert the merge fields for the
   destination address. Choose the Insert Postal Bar Code button if you
   want to add a postal bar code or an FIM-A courtesy reply mail bar code
   to your envelopes. Choose OK.

<P><LI>In the Mail Merge Helper dialog, under Step 2: Data Source, select Edit
   Data: &lt;&lt;document name&gt;&gt; and enter your data in the data form. Choose OK.
<P>
   The main document is now set up properly to print envelopes and be 
   merged with the data source (data file).

<P><LI>To merge the document, follow these steps:
<P>
   a. Choose the Merge To Printer button on the Mail Merge toolbar. Or, if
<P><PRE>      you are still in the Mail Merge Helper dialog box, choose the Merge
      button under Step 3: Merge the Data with the Document, select Merge
      To Printer, and choose Merge.
</PRE>   
<P><PRE>      NOTE: You can merge to a new document first to check for errors
      before printing, then simply print the resulting envelope document.
</PRE><P>
   b. Remove all paper from the printer tray and move the paper guide out
<P><PRE>      to accommodate the envelope's width. On the back of the printer, move
      the paper selector lever to the envelope icon. Open the front of the
      printer, move the internal paper selector to the envelope setting (to
      the far right).
</PRE>   
   c. Place the envelope in the sheet feeder. Straighten the envelope as
<P><PRE>      needed, but DO NOT push the envelope down into the feed mechanism
      (the printer will pull the envelope appropriately).
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      NOTE: The envelope is fed face up (with the flap against the back of
      the paper guide) and with the top of the envelope feeding into the
      printer first.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      For further instructions on setting up the printer for printing
      envelopes, see pages 22-23 of the Color StyleWriter 2400 user's
      guide.
</PRE><P>
   d. In the Print dialog box, select your Image (Color, Grayscale, or
<P><PRE>      Black &amp; White), Quality (Best, Normal or Draft). Choose the Print
      button.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      The first envelope will print, then the following error message will
      be displayed:
      
<PRE></PRE>         "Color SW 2400" is out of paper. Please add paper, then choose
         Continue.

   e. Continue feeding envelopes until the Mail Merge is completed.
