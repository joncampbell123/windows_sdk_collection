User's Guide (595) To Define a New Field for Use in The Main Document:
<P>
If you define a new field for use in the main document and later add a
field with the same name to the data document, Word displays the error
message "Duplicate field name in data document" when you go back to
the main document. This error message is only a reminder that this
field was already defined, and you can continue working on your main
document. If you used this field name in an ASK or SET instruction,
Word displays an error message when you merge the document.
<P>
User's Guide (600) Using Merge Instructions:
<P>
Word inserts the path to the data document in the DATA instruction. If
Word cannot find the data document in this location, Word asks you to
locate the data document.
<P>
User's Guide (673) Publishing Part of a Word Document:
<P>
If there is no space on your system disk, you can still run Word, but
you cannot create editions. Word displays the error message "Can't
create edition."
<P>
User's Guide (684) Embedding Objects:
<P>
Word displays the error message "Unable to embed the object class" if
there is not enough memory to run the embedding application. In this
situation, you may be able to decrease the amount of memory given to
Word in order to run both applications.
