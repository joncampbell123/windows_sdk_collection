The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for the Macintosh, version 6.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
System 7.5 includes a new feature in General Controls that allows you to
specify where Word documents are saved. (General Controls is located in the
Control Panels folder of the System Folder.) However, because Word also
offers the option of saving files in specific locations, the setting in
General Controls may conflict with Word's settings.
<P>
This article lists which folder a file is saved to under different
settings.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Document section of General Controls offers the following three
options:
<P>
<PRE>   When opening or saving a document, take me to

   o  Folder which contains the application
   o  Last folder used in the application
   o  Documents folder

</PRE>Prior to version 7.5 of Apple's System software, files were saved to the
last folder used by the application (the second option).
<P>
Word 6.0 expects to save documents in the location specified for Documents
on Word's File Locations tab. (To locate the File Locations tab, choose
Options from the Tools menu.)
<P>
The following list shows you how Word responds, depending on the options
you have selected:
<P>
<P><h3>"Folder Which Contains the Application" Is selected in General Controls</h3>
 
<P>
You open a file from Word's File menu:
<P>
<PRE>   New documents are saved to the location specified by Word (in Tools,
   Options, File Locations).

</PRE>You open a file by double-clicking the document icon:
<P>
<PRE>   Choosing Open from the File menu shows the location specified by Word
   (in Tools, Options, File Locations).

   New documents are saved to the location specified by Word (in Tools,
   Options, File Locations)

   Existing files are saved to the location specified by Word (in Tools,
   Options, File Locations).

   Choosing Save As shows the last-used location.

</PRE><h3>"Last Folder Used in the Application" Is selected in General Controls</h3>
 
<P>
You open a document from Word's File menu:
<P>
<PRE>   New documents are saved to the location specified by Word (in Tools,
   Options, File Locations).

</PRE>You open a file by double-clicking the document icon:
<P>
<PRE>   Choosing Open from the File menu shows the last folder used by
   the application.

   New documents are saved to the last folder used by the application.

   Existing files are saved to their original location.

</PRE><h3>"Documents Folder" Is selected in General Controls</h3>
 
<P>
You open a file from Word's File menu:
<P>
<PRE>   The next time you save a file, a folder named "Documents" appears on
   the desktop, and the Word document is saved there. A document icon
   appears on the "Documents" folder. Subsequent files are saved to that
   same folder.

   The folder remains active even if it is moved to another location.

</PRE>You open a file by double-clicking the document icon:
<P>
<PRE>   Choosing Open from the File menu shows the Documents folder
   described above.

   New documents are saved to the Documents folder.

   Existing files are saved to their original location.
