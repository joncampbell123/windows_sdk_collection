<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
With the MACROBUTTON field in Microsoft Word for Windows, you can
create a button in your document that invokes a macro when you double-
click it. The syntax of this field is as follows
<P>
<PRE>   {MACROBUTTON macroName buttonText}

</PRE>where macroName is the name of the macro you want the button to invoke,
and buttonText is the text or graphic you want to serve as the button
in the document. To insert the field braces, press CTRL+F9.
<P>
When you display the result of the MACROBUTTON field, either the text
or graphic that you specified as the buttonText instruction is
displayed. Word automatically updates the field's result whenever you
edit the field. If you have a mouse, double-click the text or graphic
returned by the MACROBUTTON field to run the macro specified in the
field's macroName argument. If you don't have a mouse, use the keyboard
to select the text or graphic returned by the MACROBUTTON field, and
press ALT+SHIFT+F9 to run the specified macro.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
There are two ways to use a graphic (instead of text) to represent the
button. The first is to use a separate graphic file, and the second is
to include the graphic directly in the document.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1</h3>
 
<P>
To use a separate graphic file, in Word version 6.0, the syntax is as
follows:
<P>
{MACROBUTTON macroName {includepicture
c:\\directory\\subdirectory\\file}}
<P>
The IMPORT or INCLUDEPICTURE field code is a field code you insert
within the MACROBUTTON field telling the program to insert the
referenced graphic file. The advantage of this method is that the
graphic does not increase the size of your document.
<P>
To use a separate graphic file, the field code syntax is as follows for
Word versions 1.0 and 2.0:
<P>
<PRE> {MACROBUTTON macroName {import c:\\directory\\subdirectory\\file}}

</PRE><h3>Method 2</h3>
 
<P>
You can also insert the button graphic directly into your document:

<OL><P><LI>Copy the graphic you intend to use as the button to the Clipboard.
   (You  could do this by temporarily placing the graphic somewhere in
   your  document and Cutting it to the Clipboard.)

<P><LI>Create a MACROBUTTON field.

<P><LI>Place the insertion point in the MACROBUTTON field where the
   buttonText instruction should appear.

<P><LI>On the Edit menu, choose Paste Special and select Picture to insert
   the graphic as the button.
<P>
</OL>The advantage of this method is that if you want to distribute the
document to others, you can distribute the document as one file.
