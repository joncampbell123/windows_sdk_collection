The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows

<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When a text box contains only a picture, the picture and text box may be
deleted when you try to type text into the text box.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
If you want to type text in a text box that contains only a picture,
secondary (right) mouse click the border of the text box and click Edit
Text on the shortcut menu. This places your insertion point to the left
of the picture. Any text typed into the text box forces the picture down.
You may have to resize the text box depending on the amount of text typed
into the text box.
<P>
If you will type text after the picture is in the text box, press ESC+END.
This places the insertion point below the picture. You may have to resize
the text box depending on the amount of text you type into the text box.
<P>
If you don't need the picture in the text box, then select the picture
(after text has been typed in the text box) and delete the picture. The
text box is not deleted if you add text to the text box before deleting
the picture.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the products listed at the
beginning of this article. Microsoft is researching this problem and will
post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This feature is different than Word for Windows 95, Word 6.0 for Windows,
Word 6.0 for Windows NT, and Word 6.0 for the Macintosh. In the previous
versions of Word, you can select just the picture and type text into a
text box containing only a picture,. The text replaces the picture without
deleting the text box.
<P>
In Microsoft Word 97 for Windows, with a text box containing only a
picture, if you select the picture and type text, the picture and the text
box are deleted. The typed text is added to the body of the document.
