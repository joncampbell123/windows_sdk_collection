The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 2.0, 2.0a, 2.0a-CD, 2.0b,
   2.0c, 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows 95, versions 7.0, 7.0a
<LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
You cannot instruct the Word for Windows spelling checker to ignore all
instances of a repeated word. However, if the double word is one you will
be using repeatedly in the document (for instance, if it is a proper name
such as "Bora Bora" or "Walla Walla") you can format the double word for No
Proofing, define it as an AutoText entry (or in Word 2.x, glossary entry),
and then use the AutoText (or glossary) entry to enter the word. This
prevents the repeated or double words from being flagged.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To prevent double words from being flagged, use the steps appropriate for
your version of Word.
<P>
<P><h3>Word 97</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Type the name or words (for example, Bora Bora) in a new document.

<P><LI>Select the name or words. On the Tools menu, point to Language, and
   then click Set Language.

<P><LI>In the Mark Selected Text As list box, select No Proofing and click OK.

<P><LI>The text should still be highlighted. If it is not, select it again. On
   the Insert menu, point to AutoText, and then click New.

<P><LI>In the Create AutoText dialog box, type a short descriptive name, (for
   example, Bora), and click the OK button.

<P><LI>Where you want to use the word or proper name, type the AutoText entry
   name (Bora) and press the F3 key. The contents of the AutoText entry
   (Bora Bora) appears where you typed the AutoText entry name.
<P>
   This text will not be flagged during the spelling check. Also, the word
   will not be flagged in any other new documents you create (as long as
   you enter it using the AutoText entry).
<P>
</OL><h3>Word 6.0, 7.0</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Type the name or words (for example, Bora Bora) in a new document.

<P><LI>Highlight the name or words. From the Tools menu, choose Language.

<P><LI>From the Mark Selected Text As list box, select No Proofing and click
   OK.

<P><LI>The text should still be highlighted. If it is not, select it again.
   From the Edit menu, choose AutoText.

<P><LI>In the AutoText Name field, type a short descriptive name, (for example,
   Bora), and click the Add button.

<P><LI>Where you want to use the word or proper name, type the AutoText entry
   name (Bora) and press the F3 key. The contents of the AutoText entry
   (Bora Bora) appears where you typed the AutoText entry name.
<P>
   This text will not be flagged during the spelling check. Also, the word
   will not be flagged in any other new documents you create (as long as
   you enter it using the AutoText entry).
<P>
</OL><h3>Word 2.x</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Type the name or words (for example, Bora Bora) in a new document.

<P><LI>Highlight the name or words. From the Format menu, choose Language.

<P><LI>In the Mark Selected Text As box, select No Proofing.

<P><LI>The text should still be highlighted. If it is not, select it
   again. From the Edit menu, choose Glossary.

<P><LI>In the Glossary Name field, type a short descriptive name, (for
   example, bora), and choose the Define button.

<P><LI>Where you want to use the word or proper name, type the glossary entry
   name (bora) and press the F3 key. The contents of the glossary entry
   (Bora Bora) appears where you typed the glossary entry name.
<P>
   This text will not be flagged during the spelling check. Also, the word
   will not be flagged in any other new documents you create (as long as
   you enter it using the glossary entry).
<P>
</OL>Whenever you know you will need double words (such as place names) in a
document, type them, format them as No Proofing, and define them as
AutoText (or glossary) entries. Taking these steps in advance will save you
time both when you enter the text and when you spell check the document.
