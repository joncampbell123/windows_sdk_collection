The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Office 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
ODMA is a standardized, high-level interface that enables you to
transparently access a document management system (DMS) from your desktop
program.
<P>
ODMA makes DMS services available to you through a desktop program,
such as Microsoft Word 97 for Windows. With ODMA, these services appear to
be an extension of the program.
<P>
Common DMS software packages will replace the standard Open and Save dialog
boxes in Word with customized dialog boxes that provide security and
version control functions such as:

<UL><LI>a way to enter or remove a document

<LI>controlled access to documents

<LI>locks on any document when checked out

<LI>some degree of security when distributing documents

<LI>a means for quick searches on the names of documents in the system

<LI>a means of tracking access to the document system
<P>
</UL>In order to enable ODMA functionality in Word or Office, you must install a
DMS system along with the Word or Office software.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Described below are the specific files and steps an application goes
through during integration.
<P>
<P><h3>Opening an ODMA-compliant Application</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>The application looks to see if an ODMA compliant document management
   product is installed. It does this by first looking in the Windows
   Registry.
<P>
   Using Regedit and doing a search on ODMA32 will display the ODMA key.

<P><LI>After finding the ODMA32 entry, the application will look under the
   key to find which document management product is installed.
<P>
   In this case the entry GRPWISE will be found. The value for this key is
   Gwodm132.dll.

<P><LI>After finding that ODMA is registered, the application then redirects
   certain calls to the Odma32.dll.

<P><LI>The Odma32.dll then calls two GroupWise DLLs which handle the
   application's function calls. These files are Gwodm132.dll and
   Gwdm1us.dll. All three of these files are located in the
   Windows\System directory.
<P>
</OL><h3>Point-to-Point Integrations</h3>
 
<P>
Point-to-Point integrations involve applications that are not ODMA
compliant. Novell has written macros for various applications that allow
these applications to integrate with GroupWise 5 and achieve the same
functionality as ODMA compliant applications. Currently there are only two
of these applications: Microsoft Word 7.x and Excel 7.x.
<P>
<P><h3>Opening a Point-to-Point Integrated Application</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>When the application starts it looks in its startup directory for any
   macros to load. The startup directory for Excel 7.x is Xlstart; the Word
   7.x startup directory is Startup. When the GroupWise client is
   installed, it will copy the appropriate macro to the startup directory.
   The Excel 7.x macro is Gwxlus.Xla and the Word 7.x macro is Gwnormus.dot
   (the letters "us" in the macro name designate language and will be
   different depending upon the language of the add-in or template).

<P><LI>Steps 2, 3 and 4 are the same in the earlier section "Opening an ODMA
   Application." The only difference is that the macro is responsible for
   making the appropriate calls, rather than the application itself.
<P>
</OL><h3>Installing a Point-to-Point Integrated Application after GroupWise Client</h3>
 
<P>
To do this, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Copy the appropriate file for Excel 7.x or Word 7.x from the GroupWise
   Client directory to the startup directory for the application as
   listed earlier in this article.

<P><LI>Edit the Gwappint.inf file located in the Windows\System directory.
<P>
   This is a text file, not a Windows installation file.

<P><LI>Find the [Word 7] or [Excel 7] section.

<P><LI>Change the Integrations line to read "INTEGRATIONS=1"

<P><LI>Open GW5 and create a New Document for that program (Word / Excel). Open
   the document and integrations should now appear.
<P>
</OL><h3>Windows Registry</h3>
 
<P>
The GroupWise 5 Document Management places the following two keys
in the Windows Registry:
<P>
Path: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Novell\GroupWise\Client
Key: Integration First Time
Value Name: (Default)
Value Data: Done\Yes
<P>
Path: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Novell\GroupWise\Client
Key: Library
Value Name: Integrations
Value Data: Enable\Disabled
