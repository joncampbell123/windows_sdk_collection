<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
There are several reserved bookmarks that can be set and automatically
updated in Word for Windows using the WordBASIC macro language.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Bookmarks can be set in a Word for Windows document as a way of
getting to a specific reference point quickly from anywhere in the
document. You can set defined bookmarks manually or use the reserved
bookmarks that Word places in a document and automatically updates.
These reserved bookmarks and their definitions are listed along with
examples on pages 103-107 of the "Microsoft Word for Windows and OS/2
Technical Reference."
<P>
The reserved bookmarks can be used with several WordBASIC statements
in macros for specific tasks. One useful WordBASIC statement used with
reserved bookmarks is the CmpBookmarks() statement. This statement is
used to compare bookmarks. This can be useful in performing a
particular task on text between two bookmarks.
<P>
For example:
<P>
<PRE>Sub Main
</PRE>While CmpBookmarks ("\Sel", "\EndOfDoc")
.
.
.
Wend
<PRE>End Sub

</PRE>This macro sets one bookmark at the current selection or the insertion
point (\Sel), and one bookmark at the end of the document (\EndOfDoc)
and executes the commands listed between the While and Wend statements
until Sel is equal to EndOfDoc. As a result, the desired action is
performed on the text from the initial position of the cursor to the
end of the document. This is just one example of how the special
reserved bookmarks can be used in Word for Windows.
