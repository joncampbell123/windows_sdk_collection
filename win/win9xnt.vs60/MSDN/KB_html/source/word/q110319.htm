The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows 95, version 7.0
<LI>Microsoft Office and Office Professional for Windows version 3.0
</UL>

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you run the Word for Windows Setup program from one disk drive (such as
A), then later run Setup from a different disk drive (such as B) or from a
different network location, Word prompts you to insert the disks in the
drive from which you originally installed Word. Setup gives you no
opportunity to designate a different disk drive.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Setup records the drive from which you originally installed Word in the
SETUP.STF file, which is located in the &lt;WINWORD&gt;\SETUP subdirectory. Setup
refers to this recorded location in subsequent Setup sessions when it
prompts you to insert Word disks.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
If you want to install Word from a different drive, you must edit your
SETUP.STF file using the following procedure:

<OL><P><LI>Exit Word Setup.

<P><LI>Make a backup copy of the original SETUP.STF

<P><LI>Open the SETUP.STF file in a spreadsheet application such as Microsoft
   Excel or a text editor such as Windows Write.

<P><LI>In SETUP.STF, search for "Source Directory" (without the quotation
   marks). This setting is near the beginning of the file.

<P><LI>Replace the old drive letter and path with the new one, then save and
   close the file. For example, if you want to use drive B instead of drive
   A to install Word, change the SETUP.STF setting to the following:
<P>
<PRE>      Source Directory   &lt;TAB&gt;   B:\   &lt;TAB&gt;

   Note: In the above example, &lt;TAB&gt; means to press TAB. (This is a three-
   column, tab-delimited text file.)

</PRE><P><LI>Save the SETUP.STF in a text format from whatever editor you are using.
