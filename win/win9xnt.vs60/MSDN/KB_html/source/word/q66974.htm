The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 2.0, 2.0a, 2.0a-CD, 2.0b, 2.0c

</UL> 
<P>
To use the ASK field conditioned upon the value of another field,
include the IF statement inside the ASK field instead of including the
ASK statement in the IF field.
<P>
<P><h3>Example 1: Entry of "none" for no spouse</h3>
 
<P>
The following example asks if you are married. If you respond with
"Yes", it then asks for your spouse's name. If you respond with "No",
it will then ask you to type "none". (The \*Firstcap switch is
included so the response can be "yes" or "Yes".)
<P>
<PRE>   {ASK Married "Are you married?" \*Firstcap}
   {ASK SpouseName {IF Married = "Yes" "What is your Spouse's Name?"
   "Type 'none'"}}
   {REF Married}
   {REF SpouseName}

</PRE>In the this example, the second ASK field has an IF statement that
determines if the bookmark "Married" is equal to "Yes." If it is, the
IF field has the value "SpouseName." If not, the field has no value.
The ASK field is not updated if it does not have a valid bookmark name
as the first element; therefore, it does not ask the question.
<P>
<P><h3>Example 2: No entry for no spouse</h3>
 
<P>
The following example asks if you are married. If you respond with
"Yes", it then asks for your spouse's name. If you respond with "No",
it will enter No for the reference to the bookmark of "Married" and no
question will be asked about the spouse; no entry will be made to the
bookmark called "SpouseName". 
<P>
{set SpouseName ""}
{ask Married "Are you married?" \* firstcap}
{ask{if{Married}="Yes" "SpouseName"}"What is your Spouses's name?"}
