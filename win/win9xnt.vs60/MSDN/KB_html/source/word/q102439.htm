<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
According to Adobe Technical Support, versions of ATM earlier than
2.0 have not been tested and are not guaranteed compatible with
Windows version 3.1.
<P>
Adobe Type Manager is manufactured by Adobe Systems, Inc., a vendor
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise,
regarding this product's performance or reliability. Support for ATM
is the sole responsibility of Adobe Systems, Inc. Contact Adobe
Technical Support at (408) 986-6500.
<P>
<P><h3>Adobe Screen Fonts Not Appearing in Word for Windows</h3>
 
<P>
Adobe soft fonts dated earlier than the release of Windows version 3.0
(May 1990) do not appear in Word for Windows. Adobe Systems, Inc., has
confirmed this to be a problem with Word for Windows due to the font
metrics of the screen fonts. ATM screen fonts dated after May, 1990,
appear in Word for Windows and other applications that run with
Windows version 3.0.
<P>
Recommendation: Upgrade to the latest version of ATM to correct this
<PRE>                problem.

</PRE><h3>UAE with ATM and Word for Windows</h3>
 
<P>
Applies to: Word versions 1.x, Windows version 3.0
<P>
When you run ATM with Word for Windows, an unrecoverable application
error (UAE) may occur when you apply certain character formatting
using the keyboard.
<P>
If you press CTRL+S, CTRL+F, CTRL+V, or CTRL+P, a UAE may occur, and
any unsaved work will be lost. These key combinations are the Word
keyboard commands for applying a style, choosing a font, choosing a
color, and choosing a point size, respectively.
<P>
<PRE>Workaround:     Instead of using the above key combinations, use the
                mouse to select styles, fonts, and point sizes on the
                ribbon, or apply these formats using the Word menus.

</PRE>Recommendation: Upgrade to the latest version of ATM to correct this
<PRE>                problem.

</PRE><h3>ATM Fonts Not Listed in Word for Windows After Installation</h3>
 
<P>
Applies to: Word versions 1.x
<P>
ATM fonts do not appear in the Format Character dialog box or in the
Fonts list on the ribbon in Word for Windows until you choose Printer
Setup from the File menu, select your printer, and then choose OK.
<P>
This happens because Word does not add the ATM fonts to the list of
available fonts in the WINWORD.INI file until you run the File Printer
Setup command. At that point, Word reads the ATM information in the
Windows WIN.INI file and updates the WINWORD.INI file.
<P>
<P><h3>Typeface Changes on Ruler and Status Bar with ATM</h3>
 
<P>
If you use ATM, the typeface of the text on the Word ruler and status
bar may change from Helvetica to an ATM font. This happens when ATM
substitutes an ATM font for the one Word usually selects.
<P>
Word usually selects the first variable-pitch sans serif font in the
[Fonts] section of the WIN.INI file. When ATM is running, Word may
select the first variable-pitch sans serif font in the [Fonts] section
of the ATM.INI file instead.
<P>
<PRE>Workaround:     Add the Helvetica font entry to the beginning of the
                [Fonts] section of the ATM.INI file to restore the
                appearance of the ruler and status bar.

</PRE>For more information on problems with the ruler and status bar
appearance, query on the following words in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:
<P>
<PRE>   status and bar and displays and incorrectly and font

</PRE><h3>Print Option Not Available When Using PRD Drivers and ATM</h3>
 
<P>
Applies to: Word versions 1.x
<P>
The File Print command in Word is unavailable if you are using any of
the Word for Windows .PRD printer drivers while ATM version 1.1 is
running.
<P>
To correct this problem, use the following instructions to turn off
ATM before you use any of the PRD printer drivers in Word:

<OL><P><LI>Run the Adobe Control Panel from Windows Program Manager.

<P><LI>At the ATM option, choose Off.

<P><LI>Choose Exit and then choose OK.

<P><LI>Quit Windows and then restart Windows.
<P>
</OL><h3>Unable to Print White Text on Black Background Using ATM</h3>
 
<P>
You may be unable to print white text on a black background in Word if
you are using ATM fonts.
<P>
Recommendation: 1. Upgrade to the latest version of ATM to correct
<PRE>                   this problem.

                   -or-

                 2. Add the following settings to the ATM.INI file:

                       [colors]
                       forceblack=on
                       printerpure=on

</PRE></OL><h3>Overlapping Text Cropped with PostScript Printer and ATM</h3>
 
<P>
When text areas overlap in Word, the text is cropped if you use
Windows version 3.0 and print to a PostScript printer or if you use
ATM.
<P>
This happens because of a problem with the PostScript printer driver
supplied with Windows version 3.0. If you switch to a different
printer driver and print to a non-PostScript printer, the problem does
not occur. If you are using ATM and printing to a non-PostScript
printer, you must disable ATM to correctly print overlapping text.
<P>
This problem was corrected in the Microsoft Windows operating system
version 3.1.
