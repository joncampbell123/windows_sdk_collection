The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, version 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you scroll through or print a document that contains a graphic, you
get one or more of the following errors, and the image appears on screen
and prints as a 1-inch square box with an X inside it.
<P>
<PRE>   Word cannot open the graphics file.

   The dimensions after cropping are too small or too large.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
These errors occur when the link to the graphic is broken--for example,
when you move either the graphic or the document, but not both, to a new
directory.
<P>
The first error occurs when you scroll through the document if the graphic
is linked but the picture is not saved in the document.
<P>
The second error message occurs when you print a document that contains a
cropped graphic if the graphic is either linked to the file or linked to
the file with the picture saved in the document.
<P>
When Word does not find the graphic, it redimensions the graphic to a size
smaller than .125 inch and generates the error "The dimensions after
cropping are too small or too large."
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Method 1: Break the link so that the graphic is an embedded object. To do
<PRE>          this:

          a. Select the object.
          b. On the Edit menu, click Links.
          c. Click Break Link.
          d. Click Yes.
          e. Click Close.

</PRE>Method 2: Display fields codes and modify the path inside the field code
<PRE>          braces so that it shows the correct path, and then press F9 to
          update the field.

          Note: You can also change the source if you click Links on the
          Edit menu. However, if you use this method when the image has
          been cropped, the image will revert to its original size.

          For additional information on how changing the source of a link
          may resize the object, please see the following article in the
          Microsoft Knowledge Base:

          ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../word/q115614.htm">Q115614</A></B>
          TITLE     : Changing the Source of a Link May Resize the Object

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
By default, when you insert a graphic, a picture or representation of the
linked object is stored in the Word document. This method increases the
file size of your document by the size of the graphic image. You can reduce
the size of your document if you store only the link. When you insert a
picture with a link to the graphic, a copy of the graphic is not stored in
the file. The picture is only linked to the file. When you display field
codes, the field code appears as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   {INCLUDEPICTURE C:\\WINWORD\\CLIPART\\HORSE.WMF \* MERGEFORMAT \d}

</PRE>When the image is linked and saved in the document, the field code
appears like this:
<P>
<PRE>   {INCLUDEPICTURE C:\\WINWORD\\CLIPART\\HORSE.WMF \* MERGEFORMAT }

</PRE>If a source graphic is not available when you open the document, you may
see only a rectangular placeholder in your document. When the graphic is
available, Word displays a representation of the graphic based on the data
in the source file but does not store the representation in the Word
document. Each time Word displays the graphic, the image on the screen is
created from the source file
