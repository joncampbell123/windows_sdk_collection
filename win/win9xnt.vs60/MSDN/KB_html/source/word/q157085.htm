<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The WordPerfect 5.x converter included with Word 97, is designed to take
advantage of features and conversion capabilities specifically available in
Word 97. For best results converting to and from Word 97, use the
WordPerfect 5.x converter shipped with Word 97.
<P>
Converting a file from Word format to WordPerfect format and back again may
cause the loss of some formatting (for example, fonts, justification,
styles, and mail merge) unless you load, paginate, and save the converted
file in WordPerfect before converting back to Word.
