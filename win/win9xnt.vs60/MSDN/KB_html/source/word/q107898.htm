</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After running SETUP /Q to install Microsoft Word for Windows to a
workstation, the Word for Windows directories are created, and the
SETUP.STF file is copied to the machine, but no icons are created, and the
.INI files are not modified.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
By default Batch Mode Root Object ID in the SETUP.STF is set to 13:01,
which indicates a "Floppy Install." It should be set to 14:01, which
indicates a "Network install."
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Search the SETUP.STF for “Batch Mode Root Object ID.” Using Excel, choose
Find from the Edit Menu and type “Batch Mode Root Object ID” in the Find
What box. If Word was installed using 1.2 MB or 1.44 MB floppy disks, this
is cell A19. If the Upgrade package was used, this is cell A20.
<P>
Change the Batch Mode Root Object ID value from 13:01 to 14:01 (may
sometimes be listed as 14:1.) If Word was installed using 1.2 MB or 1.44 MB
floppy disks, this is cell B19. If the Upgrade package was used, this is
cell B20.
<P>
Note: The cell references given above are for Word 6.0 for Windows and are
subject to change in future releases. They may also change if the SETUP.STF
file has been modified.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Word for Windows. This
problem was corrected in versions 6.0a and later of Word for Windows.
<P>
To obtain Word 6.0c, call the Microsoft Order Desk at (800) 360-7561 and
request the Word 6.0c update. If you are outside the United States, contact
your local subsidiary. To locate your subsidiary, see the Microsoft World
