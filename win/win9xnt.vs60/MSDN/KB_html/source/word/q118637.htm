The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows 95, version 7.0
<LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The ADVANCE field may cause "advanced text" to (1) appear lowered rather
than raised, or (2) disappear from view.
<P>
For the following examples, assume an ADVANCE field can be found after
"Have" in the sentence "Have a nice day." For example,
<P>
<PRE>   line 5
   line 6          Have {ADVANCE \u 72} a nice day.

</PRE>In the example above, the ADVANCE field would advance "a nice day." one
inch or 72 points up the page from the text "Have." For example,
<P>
<PRE>                         a nice day.




   line 6          Have

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
LOWERED: If the line spacing is set to Single, the upward motion of the
advanced text actually increases the line's overall spacing. Therefore, the
text before the ADVANCE field appears to have been lowered, and the text
after the ADVANCE field appears to have remained where it was originally
positioned. For example, see "Have a nice day." on line 6. The text "Have"
appears to have been lowered when actually the line spacing has increased
and the text adjusts to consume its full height. Hence, "Have" is sitting
on the bottom of the line space and "a nice day" has risen to the top of
the line space.
<P>
<P>
<PRE>                         a nice day.




   line 6          Have

</PRE>DISAPPEARS: If line spacing is set to Exactly, the advanced text is
positioned beyond the given amount of line spacing and will disappear from
view. It will not display correctly in print preview, page layout view, but
it will print correctly. For example:
<P>
<PRE>                                       &lt;the text "a nice day" does not
   line 2                              display as the ADVANCE field
   line 3                              pushes it up to line 1 It
   line 4                              disappears from view as it goes
   line 5                              beyond line 6's line space;
   line 6          Have                however, it will print.&gt;

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design. ADVANCE fields allow for better conversion of
WordPerfect documents. They are not necessarily the best method to position
text in Word.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Method 1: Format lines that include an ADVANCE field with Exactly line
<PRE>          spacing. (To do this, choose Paragraph from the Format menu,
          choose the Indents And Spacing tab. In the Line Spacing box
          choose Exactly, use the default point size shown and choose the
          OK button.)

          Again, the text may disappear from view as the advanced text
          moves beyond a line's given amount of line spacing, but it will
          print. The line following the Advance field may appear clipped on
          the display but will print fine as long as its final position is
          within the margins.

</PRE>Method 2: Frame text and position the frame on the page, rather than using
<PRE>          an ADVANCE field.

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
ADVANCE switches (\D, \U, \L, and \R) are relative pen movements WITHIN a
line of text. For example, {ADVANCE \U 72} in the middle of a line will
position text after the ADVANCE field 1 inch above the text, left of the
ADVANCE field. The effect is similar to formatting all the characters after
the ADVANCE field as "raised by 72 pt."
<P>
To raise or lower text in Word:

<OL><P><LI>From the Format menu, choose Font.

<P><LI>Select the Character Spacing tab.

<P><LI>In the Position box, select Raised or Lowered.

<P><LI>In the By box, specify in points the amount you want to raise or lower
   text, and choose the OK button.
<P>
</OL>With use of its new ADVANCE field format, Word 6.0 now successfully
converts the majority of the cases where Advance codes are used in
WordPerfect documents. WordPerfect up, down, to-line, left, and right
Advance formats and horizontal/vertical combinations thereof are mapped to
equivalent Word 6.0 ADVANCE \U, \D, \L, \R, \X, and \Y formats, and vice
versa.
<P>
Word 6.0 for Windows is the first version of Word to support Advance
formatting of WordPerfect 5.1 for MS-DOS and versions 5.1 and 5.2 for
Windows. Advance formatting is not a feature of earlier versions of Word
where Advance codes are ignored during conversion..
