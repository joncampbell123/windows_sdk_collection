<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article questions and answers about setup for Word for Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<PRE>   1. Q. How can I easily remove all or parts of the Word program?
   
      A. Word Setup has a maintenance mode that you can use to add and
         remove Word components. After you originally install Word,
         Setup runs in maintenance mode. If you want to remove the
         entire Word program from your hard disk, choose the Remove All
         button. Setup removes the Word program and icons in Program
         Manager, but it does not remove the Word directory or the icon
         group.
   
         To add or remove certain components, choose the Add/Remove
         button. When you clear the check box for a Word component,
         Setup removes it from your current installation. Whenever you
         clear a check box, Setup displays the following message before
         it continues: "You have chosen to remove &lt;N&gt; component(s). Are
         you sure you want to remove it?"
   
         In the Maintenance Mode dialog box, you should clear only the
         check boxes for the components you want to remove. If you leave
         an item selected that's already installed, Setup will not
         reinstall it (so the process won't take too long).
   
   2. Q. Word for Windows Setup stops before it is finished. How do
         I prevent this from happening?
   
      A. The Word Setup program may stop when it encounters conflicts
         with your system configuration. Use the following steps to
         successfully install Word:
   
         1. In your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files, include only the
            devices or drivers necessary to run Windows and your
            computer. Remove any third-party shell programs such as the
            PC Tools shell or Norton Desktop. Refer to your Windows
            documentation for more information on configuring your
            system.
   
         2. In Windows, close all other applications, including virus-
            checking software and screen savers, before you run Word
            Setup.
   
         3. Make sure the PATH statement in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file
            includes the complete path to your Windows directory,
            including the drive letter. For example, if C:\WINDOWS is
            your Windows directory, your path statement must include the
            following:
   
               path=c:\windows
   
            IMPORTANT: If you change the PATH statement, restart your
            computer so the change can take effect.
   
         4. If you are running Windows in 386 enhanced mode and the
            above steps do not help, start Windows in standard mode by
            typing  WIN/S  at the MS-DOS command prompt, and then run
            Word Setup.
   
         5. If you use the MS-DOS SUBST command to substitute a drive
            letter for the path to your SHARE.EXE file, Word Setup
            cannot find SHARE, even if it loads successfully from the MS-
            DOS command prompt and is already running on your computer.
            If this happens, remove the SUBST command from your
            AUTOEXEC.BAT file and restart your computer.
   
         6. Word for Windows requires SHARE.EXE to run. If Setup hangs
            or instructs you to install SHARE, add the following line to
            your AUTOEXEC.BAT file and then restart your computer so the
            change can take effect
   
               &lt;path&gt;\share.exe /L:500 /F:5100
   
            where &lt;path&gt; is the drive and directory where the SHARE.EXE
            file is located (usually the MS-DOS directory).
   
   3. Q. What's the difference between the Typical and Complete/Custom
         Setup options?
   
      A. You can use the Complete/Custom option to install the entire
         Word package or to select certain Setup options. The Typical
         option installs all Word components except the following:
   
          - Dialog Editor
   
          - WordBasic Help (WRDBASIC.HLP)
   
          - ODBC files
   
          - Microsoft Graph and Microsoft Equation Editor
   
          - The MACRO subdirectory, which contains the following business
            letter template and macro files: CONVERT.DOT, LAYOUT.DOT,
            MACRO60.DOT, and TABLES.DOT
   
          - Two text converters:
   
               Word for Windows 6.0
               RFT-DCA
   
          - Four graphics filters:
   
               Micrografx Designer(TM)/Draw
               CGM (Computer Graphics Metafile)
               PCX
               CompuServe(R) GIF
   
   4. Q. Can I install Word 6.0 over my installation of Word
         version 1.x or 2.x for Windows?
   
      A. Word 6.0 is designed to install over Word 1.x or 2.x files.
         However, to avoid any potential naming conflicts among
         templates and text files, you may want to install Word 6.0 in a
         new directory. You should also install Word 6.0 in a different
         directory if you want to retain your previous version of Word.
   
   5. Q. How much hard disk space do I need to install Word 6.0?
   
      A. The Word Setup program offers several installation options with
         different disk space requirements.
   
          - For a Typical installation, you need approximately 18 megabytes
            (MB) of disk space (14 MB of disk space in the Word directory,
            plus 4 MB in the Windows directory).
   
          - For a Complete installation, you need approximately 25 MB of
            disk space (16 MB in the Word directory and 9 MB in the Windows
            directory).
   
          - For a Laptop/Minimum installation, you need approximately 5 MB
            of disk space (4.5 MB in the Word directory and .5 MB in the
            Windows directory).
   
         Make sure you have enough disk space for the type of
         installation you want to do before running Setup. To see
         precisely how much disk space you need, run Setup and select
         the options you want to install. Setup lists the disk space
         requirements in the bottom of the Setup dialog box.
   
   6. Q. How do I set up Word 6.0 for shared use on a network?
   
      A. Setting up Word on network workstations is a two-step process.
         First, install Word on the network file server using the new /A
         Administrator Setup switch. Then set up the workstations,
         either by installing Word on each workstation's hard disk or by
         setting up the workstations to run Word from the file server.
         If your network supports the universal naming convention (UNC),
         you can start the workstation setup using the UNC path. This
         eliminates future problems with incorrect network drive-letter
         designations. In addition, you can create custom scripts to set
         up the workstation "silently," without input from the user. For
         detailed network installation instructions, see Appendix B in
         the "Microsoft Word User's Guide."
   
   7. Q. How do I point to specific user directories when I set up
         Word 6.0 on a network?
   
      A. You can specify network user directories in the WINWORD6.INI
         file. For a full description of all the WINWORD6.INI settings,
         see the Word 6.0 README Help file. Use the following
         instructions to open the README Help file:
   
         1. Double-click the Help button on the Standard toolbar.
   
         2. Type README in the Search dialog box and then choose the
            Show Topics button.
   
         3. Choose the Go To button.
   
         4. Select the WINWORD6.INI Options jump text.
   
   8. Q. I think I may have a damaged Word for Windows disk. What
         should I do?
   
      A. It is rare for a Word disk to be defective. To determine
         whether your disks are damaged, use the following steps:
   
         1. First, determine whether your computer can read high-density
            disks. The disks supplied with your Word for Windows package
            are high density. Check the reference manual for your
            computer to determine whether your computer can read high-
            density disks. If not, you can order low-density disks using
            the coupon supplied with your Word package or by phoning
            Microsoft Sales Information Center at (800) 426-9400.
   
         2. Check your Word disks using the MS-DOS CHKDSK command. If
            the disk is not defective, CHKDSK reports no errors. If the
            disk is defective, CHKDSK reports that your computer cannot
            read the disk. If CHKDSK reports errors, call Microsoft
            Product Support Services at (425) 462-WORD and speak with a
            Word for Windows support engineer.
