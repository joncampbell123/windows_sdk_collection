The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you create a mail merge main document using the Elegant, Professional,
or Contemporary Templates, attach an envelope to the main document, and
then merge the document, the envelopes for the second and subsequent merged
documents may include headers and footers.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
During the mail merge process, Word uses the header and footer information
from the main document in the merged document. This information is in the
original template on which you based the document (Elegant, Professional or
Contemporary Template).
<P>
The Contemporary and Elegant Templates include a different first page
header and footer, and a header for the second and subsequent pages. The
Professional Template includes a different first page header, and a header
for the second and subsequent pages. During the mail merge process, Word
retains the Same as Previous property in the header and footer, and as a
result, each new section places headers and footers into the envelopes.
<P>
NOTE: This problem occurs with other Microsoft or third-party templates
that have a different header for the first page versus the remaining pages
in the document.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, open the mail merge main document and use
either of the following methods.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1: Removing the Header and Footer</h3>
 
<P>
NOTE: If you use this method, you cannot place and headers or footers into
your document.

<OL><P><LI>On the File menu, click Page Setup, and then click the Layout tab.
<P>
   NOTE: If you are unable to click Page Setup, click the first page
   of your document (not the envelope page).

<P><LI>Under Headers and Footers, click to clear the Different First Page check
   box, and then click OK.

<P><LI>On the View menu, click Header and Footer.

<P><LI>Click the Show Next button in the Header And Footer toolbar, until the
   header for section 2 is shown.

<P><LI>Select the text in the header, and then click Clear on the Edit menu.

<P><LI>Click the "Switch Between Header and Footer" button on the Header and
   Footer toolbar. If the footer for section 2 is not shown, click the Show
   Previous or Show Next button until the footer for section 2 is shown.

<P><LI>Select the text in the footer, and then click Clear on the Edit menu.

<P><LI>Click Close on the Header and Footer toolbar.
<P>
</OL><h3>Method 2: Retaining the Header and Footer</h3>
 
<P>
NOTE: This method only works with documents that are based on the Elegant
or Professional Templates. It does not work with documents based on the
Contemporary Template, because this template contains graphics.

<OL><P><LI>Place the insertion point into the upper left part of the envelope
   within the mail merge main document. The Style should be Envelope
   Return.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Page Setup, and then click the Layout tab.

<P><LI>Under Headers and Footers, click to select the Different First Page
   check box, and then click OK.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Word 97 for
Windows. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
