<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Embedded Word 6.0 for Windows document objects have default margins of 0
inches and page sizes of 6 by 9 inches or smaller. As a result, when
you embed a Word document object in another Word document or in another
program (such as Microsoft Publisher or Microsoft PowerPoint), one side
of the object may appear cropped. This happens if the page width of the
object is greater than 6 inches.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To preserve margins and page sizes for document objects, you must insert a
Word 6.0 document object and then paste the text you want into the open
object. To do this, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Select the text that you want for the object. 
<P>
<PRE>   NOTE: Be sure to include all trailing section breaks for text in the    
   section and the last paragraph mark for text of the last section of a       
   document. Page sizes and margins of sections are stored in trailing    
   section breaks and in the last paragraph mark for the last section of a    
   document.

</PRE><P><LI>On the Edit menu, click Copy.

<P><LI>Using the client program's Insert Object command, insert a Word 6.0
   document object. The object by default has margins of 0 inches and
   a page size of approximately 6 inches by 9 inches.

<P><LI>Put the insertion point in the open document object.

<P><LI>On the Edit menu, click Paste or Paste Special to insert the
   previously copied or cut text.
<P>
</OL>The object now reflects the margins and page sizes of the original
text, which may be too wide to be viewed fully in the client program.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Document text that is copied has a page size of 6 inches by 9 inches
or less and margins of 0 inches when pasted as a Word version 6.0 document
object into a client program. These settings are applied to every
section of the document object. A Word 6.0 document object created with the
Object command on the Insert menu also has the same page and margin
settings specified above.
<P>
NOTE: Paragraphs that are indented from either the left or right margin may
appear strange when pasted as an object due to the changed page width for
the object. For example, a paragraph that is indented 3 inches from the
right on an 8.5-inch-wide page appears extremely narrow when pasted as an
object (which has a 6-inch-wide page). Paragraphs or tables that contain
border formatting may appear to be missing the left or right side borders.
Borders normally extend to the left and right of indentations. This is so
that the text of the bordered paragraph will align with other text in the
document that contains no bordering (assuming the same indentation
settings). Therefore, with margins for the object at 0 inches, paragraphs
with no indentations have borders that extend off the left and right side
of the document.
<P>
Word 6.0 for Windows sets these page specifications for objects so that 
each document object can be represented at full scale visually within a 
standard Word document. Default Word documents have left and right margins 
of 1.25 inches, which leaves 6 inches of horizontal printable space. If you 
copy and paste text wider than 6 inches as an object, the object will 
extend past the area of the containing program (object page length may also 
vary).
<P>
Text narrower than 6 inches pasted as an object has a page width
approximately equal to the original width. For example, if you copy text 3-
inches wide, it pastes as an object of approximately the same width.
