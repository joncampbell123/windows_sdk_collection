The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Internet Assistant, version 1.0z
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 6.0a, 6.0c
</UL> 
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you try to browse the World Wide Web with Internet Assistant, one of
the following occurs:

<UL><LI>Internet Assistant doesn't respond (the Downloading dialog box appears,
   but the status bar stays at 0%).
<P>
   -or-

<LI>The error message "InternetWorks Error 80080005" appears when you try to
   open a Uniform Resource Locator (URL).
<P>
   -or-

<LI>The error message "Unable to Complete Dowload" appears.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The following are possible causes of these problems:

<UL><LI>You do not have a working Internet connection.

<LI>The Internet server you are trying to connect to is busy or not
   available.

<LI>Internet Assistant is not registered correctly.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 

<OL><P><LI>Verify the connection.
<P>
   You can verify that you have a working Internet Connection by starting
   the browser IWIA.EXE, which is located in your &lt;winword&gt;\INTERNET
   directory. On the File menu, click Open URL and then type the Uniform
   Resource  Locator address.  Click OK. If you have a working connection
   and the URL is fully functioning, you will be able to browse that site.
   If you are able to browse that site, switch to Internet Assistant and
   enter the URL without quitting the IWIA utility.
<P>
   If your connection is faulty, IWIA will indicate that it is
   "connecting," but you will get a timeout and an error message stating
   that the "Document is not Accessible."
<P>
   If you are trying to connect to the Internet using a proxy server, refer
   to the article below:
<P>
<P><PRE>     ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../word/q128175.htm">Q128175</A></B>
<PRE></PRE>     TITLE     : How to Configure Proxy Servers for Internet Assistant

   If you are connected to an Internet Service Provider using SLIP/PPP
   (modem) and IWIA fails to allow you to connect, try another site. If you
   are still unable to connect, contact your Internet Service Provider for
   technical assistance.

</PRE><P><LI>Re-register Internet Assistant.
<P>
   Ensure that Internet Assistant is correctly registered by doing the
   following:
<P>
   a. Rerun Internet Assistant Setup and choose the Remove All option.
<P>
   b. When the Remove All operation has finished, rerun Setup and reinstall
<P><PRE>      Internet Assistant.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      NOTE: If your registration database (REG.DAT) is damaged or corrupt,
      you can rebuild it, and then remove and reinstall Internet Assistant
      to register it. For additional information on how to rebuild your
      registration database, please see the following article in the
      Microsoft Knowledge Base:
