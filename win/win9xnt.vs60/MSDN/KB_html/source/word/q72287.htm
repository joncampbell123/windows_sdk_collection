<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article contains an example macro that switches the focus from
Microsoft Word to another application; when it is finished, the macro
returns the focus to Word. What the macro does while switching between
applications is up to the individual user.
<P>
The AppActivate statement activates the specified window in an application
other than Microsoft Word. Use AppActivate to switch to another application
that is already running or that you have started by using Shell. To
activate a window within Word, use the Activate command.
<P>
NOTE: If the other application is minimized, this macro will not
maximize that application; it simply gives that application the focus
and then returns the focus to Word for Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Word 97 for Windows or Word 98 Macintosh Edition</h3>
 
<P>
For more information about switching focus to another application using
Word 97 for Windows or Word 98 Macintosh Edition, while in the Visual Basic 
for Applications Editor, click the Office Assistant, type "AppActivate"
(without the quotation marks), click Search, and then click to view
"AppActivate Statement". For examples of how to do this in Word 97 or Word 
98, click "Example."
<P>
NOTE: If the Assistant is hidden, click the Office Assistant button on the
Standard toolbar. If Microsoft Visual Basic Help is not installed on your
computer, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../office/q120802.htm">Q120802</A></B>
   TITLE     : Office: How to Add/Remove a Single Office
               Program or Component

</PRE><h3>Word Versions 7.x and Earlier</h3>
 
<P>
The following is the text of the macro:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub Main
      ActiveWin$ = WindowName$()    'get the title of the current window
      AppActivate "Microsoft Excel", 1
      Activate ActiveWin$
   End Sub

</PRE>The WordBasic AppActivate syntax is as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   AppActivate WindowText$ [,Immediate]

</PRE>NOTE: Many applications append the name of the working file to the
application name used in the window title bar. For example, the Windows
Cardfile application might have window names such as:
<P>
<PRE>   Cardfile - (untitled)
   Cardfile - PHONE.CRD

</PRE>In this case the following AppActivate command should include
the complete window text string:
<P>
<PRE>   AppActivate "Cardfile - PHONE.CRD", 1

</PRE>Microsoft Excel includes the working file name in the windows title bar
when the spreadsheet window is maximized.
<P>
There are other methods to return the focus to Word for Windows. The
main advantage of this method is its simplicity. When the macro
returns the focus, Word for Windows will be in the exact state that it
was left in prior to running the macro.
