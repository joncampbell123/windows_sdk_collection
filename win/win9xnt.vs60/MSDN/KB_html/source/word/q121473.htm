<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>

message:
<P>
<PRE>   The application was unable to start due to an error. Please contact
   customer support.

<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>

party shareware application.
<P>
-or-
<P>
You may be running Suitcase version 2.11.
<P>
-or-
<P>

<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>

<P>
-or-
<P>
Follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>In the System folder, rename the Fonts folder to a different name. For
   example, change the name to "Fonts Temp" (without the quotation marks).

<P><LI>Restart your computer so the System will create a new Fonts folder.

<P><LI>Start Word. If Word starts without an error message, then you know there
   was a font problem.
<P>
   If a font problem is suspected, move several fonts from the renamed font
   folder to the newly created font folder. Restart your Macintosh and then
   restart Word. Repeat this procedure until you can determine which
   font(s) are causing the problem. If a font is found to be corrupted,
   either move it back to the renamed font folder, or delete the font, and
   then reinstall your font. Note that corrupted fonts usually have a file
   size of 0 kilobytes.
