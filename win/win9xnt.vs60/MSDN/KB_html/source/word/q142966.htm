The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for the Macintosh, versions 6.0, 6.0.1
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In Word, you can use the Page Setup dialog box to position text on a single
page, in a column, or in the whole document. However, to position text
within a label, each label or cell "margin" can be adjusted by setting left
and right indents and spacing before and after the text.
<P>
This article assumes you have already created a label sheet and saved it
as a template.
<P>
For additional information on creating custom labels in Word, please see
the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../word/q142965.htm">Q142965</A></B>
   TITLE     : How to Create and Save Custom Labels in Word

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In these instructions, "cell" refers to the label on the label sheet
and "table" refers to the label sheet itself.
<P>
<P><h3>Positioning Text Within a Single Cell</h3>
 
<P>
The following steps explain how to position text in a single cell in a
table:

<OL><P><LI>Create a new document based on your label template.
<P>
    For additional information, please see the following article(s) in the
    Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
       ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../word/q142965.htm">Q142965</A></B>
<PRE>       TITLE     : How to Create and Save Custom Labels in Word

</PRE><P><LI>Position the insertion point in the first paragraph of the first cell.

<P><LI>Type the first line of address text.

<P><LI>On the Format menu, click Paragraph.

<P><LI>Under Indentation Left, type (in inches) the desired distance from the
    left edge of the cell to the first word. If desired, type a measurement
    for the right edge of the cell; this is usually not required.

<P><LI>Under Spacing Before, type (in inches or points) the desired distance
    from the top edge of the cell to the first line of text.
 
<P><LI>Click OK, and then press ENTER.

<P><LI>To remove the spacing before on the second paragraph, click Paragraph
    on the Format menu. Under Spacing Before, change the value to 0 pt.
 
    NOTE: Spacing Before should only be applied to the first line of the
    cell so that no spacing appears between the lines of the address.

<P><LI>Type the remaining lines of the address.
<P>
</OL><h3>Positioning Text Within Every Cell</h3>
 
<P>
The following steps explain how to position text within every cell of the
whole table:

<OL><P><LI>Create a new document based on your label template, turn on paragraph
    marks, and position the insertion point in the first paragraph of the
    first cell.

<P><LI>On the Format menu, point to Style, and click New.

<P><LI>In the Name box, type "Rest of Label" (without the quotation marks). 
    For Style For Following Paragraph, select the "Rest of Label" style.

<P><LI>Click Format, and then select Paragraph from the list.

<P><LI>Under Indentation Left, type (in inches) the desired distance from the
    left edge of the cell to the first word of the address. Click OK.
<P>
    NOTE: If you plan to use these styles in other label documents, select
    the "Add To Template" check box. This new style will be available
    for use in any other document based on the current template.

<P><LI>Click OK.

<P><LI>Click New, and type the name "First Line of Label" (without the
    quotation marks). For Style for Following Paragraph, select the "Rest 
    of Label" style.

<P><LI>Click Format, and then select Paragraph from the list.

<P><LI>Under Indentation Left, type (in inches) the desired distance from the
    left edge of the cell to the first word of the address. Under Spacing
    Before, type (in inches or points) the desired distance from the top
    edge of the cell to the first line of text. Click OK.

<P><LI>If desired, select the Add To Template check box. See NOTE above.

<P><LI>Click OK then click Apply.
<P>
</OL>The first paragraph of the cell should now be formatted with the 'First
Line of Label' style. Once you begin to type the address information, the
remaining address lines will be formatted with the 'Rest of Label' style.
<P>
