The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you quit Microsoft Word 97, you may receive the following error
message:
<P>
<PRE>   Word cannot save or create this file. The disk may be full or write
   protected.

   Try one or more of the following:
   - Free more memory.
   - Make sure that the disk you want to save the file on is not full,
     write-protected, or damaged.
     (&lt;path&gt;\NORMAL.DOT)

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The problem occurs when all of the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>You are running Windows NT or Windows 95 with user profiles enabled.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>Office 97 installation has been performed for other users of the
   workstation, but not for you.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>The Office folder is in a location that you cannot write to. This may
   occur if you installed Word with a Run From CD installation, a Run From
   Network Server installation, or a local installation on a Windows NT
   workstation if you do not have permissions to write to the Office
   folder.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>You start and exit Word for the first time, without using the File New
   command.
<P>
</UL>When you exit Word, Word attempts to write a Normal.dot (template) file in
the Office folder. Because the Office folder is in a location that you
cannot write to, you receive the error message described in the "Symptoms"
section of this article.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Start Microsoft Word 97.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Options.

<P><LI>Click the File Locations tab.

<P><LI>Under File Types, click User Templates, and then click Modify.

<P><LI>In the Modify Location dialog box, select a new Folder Name and click
   OK. The default value is:
<P>
<P><PRE>      C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Templates
</PRE>
<P><LI>Under File Types, click Workgroup Templates, and then click Modify.

<P><LI>In the Modify Location dialog box, select a new Folder Name and click OK
   twice. The default value is undefined (blank).

<P><LI>Quit Word without saving changes to Normal.dot and then restart Word.
<P>
</OL>Word writes a new Normal.dot file in the location specified in step 5.
<P>
If Word writes the Normal.dot file in a location other than the one you
specified, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Manually move (don't copy) the Normal.dot file to the directory you
   want.

<P><LI>Follow steps 1 through 5 above to set the User Templates path to the
   directory that contains the Normal.dot file.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design, and is different from earlier versions of Word.
Earlier versions of Word search the program (Office) directory for a
Normal.dot file before searching the User Templates or Workgroup Templates
locations.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Template Search Order</h3>
 
<P>
When Word 97 starts, it automatically searches for a Normal.dot template
file upon which to base Document 1. The search order is as follows:

<OL><P><LI>Local Templates path - On the Tools menu, click Options, and click the
   File Locations tab. The setting is called "User Templates." This setting
   is stored in the following registry location:
<P>
<P><PRE>      HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\8.0\Common\FileNew
      \LocalTemplates
</PRE>
<P><LI>Shared Templates path - On the Tools menu, click Options, and click the
   File Locations tab. The setting is called "Workgroup Templates." This
   setting is stored in the following registry location:
<P>
<P><PRE>      HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\8.0\Common\FileNew
      \SharedTemplates
</PRE>
<P><LI>The program folder that contains Winword.exe.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: If there is a Normal.dot file in more than one of these locations,
Word 97 uses the first Normal.dot file it finds, based on the above search
order.
<P>
The search order for Word 97 is different than earlier versions of Word.
<P>
<P><h3>How the Registry Keys Are Written</h3>
 
<P>
Setup does not create the User Templates and Workgroup Templates paths
mentioned earlier. The registry keys are first created in
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, and Word copies them to HKEY_CURRENT_USER the first
time someone uses the File New command.
<P>
Word does not create the SharedTemplates registry key unless the
installation is an upgrade over a previous version of Office in which a
WorkGroups Templates location was specified. The process is as follows:

<OL><P><LI>Setup writes the User Templates and Workgroup Templates settings to the
   following respective registry keys:
<P>
<P><PRE>      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Office\8.0\Common\FileNew
      \LocalTemplates
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Office\8.0\Common\FileNew
      \SharedTemplates
</PRE>
<P><LI>You then log into Windows and start Word 97.

<P><LI>When you click the File menu and click New, Word copies the settings in
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE to HKEY_CURRENT_USER.
<P>
</OL><h3>Possible Problems</h3>
 
<P>
If you never use the File New command, Word never copies the registry
entries from HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE to HKEY_CURRENT_USER. In this situation,
the LocalTemplates and SharedTemplates keys in HKEY_CURRENT_USER do not
exist; therefore, Word attempts to write the Normal.dot file to the program
directory. (See item 3 in the "Template Search Order" section earlier in
this article.)
<P>
Run from Network Server Installation:
<P>
If you are running Office 97 from a network server, the error message
described earlier occurs because Word cannot save the Normal.dot file to
the program directory on the network server: a directory to which you do
not have write permissions.
<P>
Run from CD Installation:
<P>
If you are running Office 97 using a Run From CD installation, the error
message occurs because Word is trying to save the Normal.dot file to the
program directory on the Office CD: a directory which cannot be written to.
<P>
Run Local Installation:
<P>
If you are running a local installation of Office 97, Word writes the
Normal.dot file to the program directory as long as you have permission to
write to that directory. Otherwise, the error message occurs.
