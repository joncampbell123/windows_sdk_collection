The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Macintosh, versions 5.0, 5.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Sometimes you cannot open a graphic for editing in the Edit Picture
window by double-clicking the graphic or by choosing the Picture
button on the ribbon. This happens if the version 2.2 Ego for Word
Plug-in Module (PIM) is installed in the Word Commands folder.
<P>
To avoid this problem, remove Ego for Word from the Word Commands
folder.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Ego for Word, supplied with Expressionist version 3.0, is designed to
run when you double-click an Expressionist graphic. However, Ego for
Word interferes with all graphics, preventing Word for the Macintosh
from opening them in the Edit Picture window.
<P>
This problem has been reported with version 1.0 of Ego for Word
<P>
Ego is also available with Chemdraw from Cambridge Scientific Computing.
The problem is the same.
<P>
Prescience Corporation, the maker of Expressionist and Ego for Word,
is researching this problem. For more information, call Prescience at
(415) 543-2252.
<P>
Expressionist and Ego for Word are manufactured by Prescience
Corporation, a vendor independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty,
implied or otherwise, regarding these products' performance or
reliability.
