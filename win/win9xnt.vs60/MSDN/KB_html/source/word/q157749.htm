<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Word 97 has twenty callouts that you can use in a Word document.
Callouts are used to focus the reader's attention to a particular part of
the document. There are two types of callouts in Word: Line and Bubble.
<P>
A Line callout is a line box that has a leader directing the reader's
attention to a specific area of the document. There are fifteen line
callouts available, as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   Line Callout 1
   Line Callout 2
   Line Callout 3
   Line Callout 4
   Line Callout 1 (Accent Bar)
   Line Callout 2 (Accent Bar)
   Line Callout 3 (Accent Bar)
   Line Callout 4 (Accent Bar)
   Line Callout 1 (No Border)
   Line Callout 2 (No Border)
   Line Callout 3 (No Border)
   Line Callout 4 (No Border)
   Line Callout 1 (Border and Accent Bar)
   Line Callout 2 (Border and Accent Bar)
   Line Callout 3 (Border and Accent Bar)
   Line Callout 4 (Border and Accent Bar)

</PRE>A Bubble callout is a shape that does not have a leader. The shape has a
pointer as part of the shape, but it is not considered a leader. There are
four Bubble callouts available, as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   Rectangular Callout
   Rounded Rectangular Callout
   Oval Callout
   Cloud Callout

   (a four-ended arrow should be present on the mouse pointer). This will
   bring up a shortcut menu.

<P><LI>In the Format AutoShape dialog box, select the "Colors and Lines,"
   "Size," "Position," or "Wrapping" tabs and select the settings you want
   for the callout.

   callout you selected is a Line callout, the Format Callout button is
   available. However, if the callout you selected is a Bubble callout, the
   Format Callout button is unavailable.
